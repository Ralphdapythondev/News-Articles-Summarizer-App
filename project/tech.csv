Apple is reportedly planning to open multiple new Apple Stores in various locations in the country. According to a report by the Economic Times, the Cueprtino-based tech giant may open three new stores at multiple locations across the country.The report cited two industry executives to reveal that the iPhone maker is in advanced talks for opening three new stores -- one in Pune and Bengaluru, each as well as a second outlet in the National Capital Region (NCR) in Noida.As per the report, all of these rumoured Apple Stores will be in located in prominent malls located around these regions.In April 2023, Apple launched got its first-ever company stores in India. Last year, the US-based company inaugurated one store in Mumbai while another in Delhi, named Apple BKC and Apple Saket, respectively.One of the executives said that the company was waiting for its first two stores in India to complete a year of before finalising on the next phase of expansion. The report also revealed that the average selling prices in the Apple stores is similar to the company average in the country.A third executive familiar with the matter said: “Apple will not be happy with just two stores in a market like India. Of course, there are plans to expand. It is a question of when, not if.”He also added that the company might be planning to launch its premium mixed-reality headset, Apple Vision Pro in India soon.The executive claimed: “One of the prerequisites for launching the Apple Vision Pro in a market is that it should have its own Apple store . There could be an announcement around the same during the upcoming WWDC developer conference in June.”The report also noted that Apple’s two company-owned outlets in India, posted revenue of Rs 190-210 crore each last fiscal year. Both stores completed their first year of operations this month.

The Mumbai store revenue has been a little higher than the Delhi one due to a larger size. It has met Apple’s expectations, matching some of the best-performing store launches and they are now aggressively scouting space for the next three company-owned stores.”","Apple is reportedly planning to open multiple new Apple Stores in India.

CCI invites proposals for a detailed study on AI: All the details,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/cci-invites-proposals-for-a-detailed-study-on-ai-all-the-details/articleshow/109532923.cms,"What CCI has asked entities for this study



What this study will focus on



What CCI said about the study



The Competition Commission of India ( CCI ) has announced it is planning to commission a study on the influence of artificial intelligence (AI) technology on market competition. For this study, the competition watchdog has invited proposals to take into account a broader view of the potential benefits and risks of AI on competition.The study, 'Artificial Intelligence and Competition,' will explore various dimensions related to AI.This initiative will emphasise the growing importance of AI across various sectors and its potential implications on competitive dynamics. This includes its ability to shape consumer choices through personalised recommendations, services and pricing.According to a report by the news agency PTI, the CCI has issued a Request for Proposal (RFP) seeking submissions from qualified agencies or institutions interested in conducting this pivotal research. The document detailed the study's objective to examine both the positive impacts and the potential competitive risks associated with AI deployment. Notably, the commission highlighted AI's dual potential to enhance market efficiency and, conversely, to facilitate anti-competitive practices.The deadline for proposal submissions has been set for June 3. Another phase involving technical presentations scheduled before the final financial bid deadline will be on June 28.In addition to examining AI's role in shaping market behaviours, the study will also assess the broader implications of mergers and acquisitions involving AI-centric firms. It seeks to identify the key competitive advantages or disadvantages for firms that adopt or refrain from adopting AI technologies.Key areas of focus for the study will include investigating whether AI could be used to execute anti-competitive strategies and examining the emergence of potentially anti-competitive tactics facilitated by AI technologies. Furthermore, the research will explore issues such as algorithmic biases and their effects on market competition as well as the dynamics of collusion driven by self-learning algorithms.Other notable elements of the study include evaluating how AI influences market entry and exit barriers, concentration, innovation incentives , and overall market power. The CCI aims to leverage the findings to identify enforcement and advocacy priorities concerning AI's application in the marketplace.The study will also review existing and evolving legal frameworks governing AI in India and other major jurisdictions, consulting with various stakeholders to gain a comprehensive understanding of the landscape.In an interview with PTI, CCI Chairperson Ravneet Kaur emphasised that while AI and machine learning have the potential to drive significant efficiencies and innovations, they also pose challenges related to market concentration and potential anti-competitive behaviours.","The Competition Commission of India ( CCI ) has announced it is planning to commission a study on the influence of artificial intelligence (AI) technology on market competition.

"Android 15 to bring improved notification management, here’s what it means for users",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/android-15-to-bring-improved-notification-management-heres-what-it-means-for-users/articleshow/109531386.cms,"Android 15 is set to revolutionise notification management , providing users with enhanced control over app notifications. The upcoming update introduces a feature that hides unused notification channels by default, offering a streamlined experience and making it easier to curb promotional and spammy notifications .Notification channels, a hallmark of Android's notification system, allow users to customise their notification preferences with granular control.However, many apps inundate users with unnecessary channels, making it challenging to discern which ones to disable to silence unwanted messages.Mishaal Rahmaan has uncovered hidden flags in Android 15 Beta 1, which enable the automatic hiding of unused notification channels. By tapping into this feature, users can reveal a condensed list of notification channels that an app has actually used to send notifications. This functionality empowers users to quickly identify and disable unwanted channels, enhancing the overall notification management experience.For instance, Rahmaan's exploration revealed that Instagram, despite creating 25 notification channels, only utilises a fraction of them. With the new feature in Android 15, the OS automatically hides the unused channels, simplifying the process for users to manage their notification preferences.While the hidden feature may not be guaranteed to make its way into the final release of Android 15, Rahmaan is optimistic about its inclusion, especially considering its functionality in the beta version. Google may officially unveil this notification channel improvement during its upcoming Google I/O keynote, signalling a significant step forward in Android's notification handling capabilities.","Mishaal Rahmaan has uncovered hidden flags in Android 15 Beta 1, which enable the automatic hiding of unused notification channels.

Zuckerberg takes a dig at Apple

Facebook parent company Meta has announced that it will offer Horizon OS – the software that powers its Meta Quest devices to third-party hardware makers like Microsoft , Asus and Lenovo , among others, as it expands its plans to take on Apple in the emerging virtual and mixed reality industry.Company CEO Mark Zuckerberg made the announcement in a video he shared on Instagram.“Some updates on the metaverse. Today we're opening up Meta Horizon OS - our operating system powering Quest - so others can design more headsets in our ecosystem,” he said in the post.“Lenovo, Microsoft, and ASUS are some of our first partners, with more coming too. Looking forward to a new wave of headsets focused on productivity, entertainment, gaming, exercise, and more!” Zuckerberg added.The move will allow these tech companies to build their headsets that will run on Meta Horizon OS, the operating system that offers capabilities like gesture recognition, passthrough, scene understanding and spatial anchors to the devices that run on it.Meta’s virtual reality (VR) and mixed reality (MR) devices are powered by Horizon OS which is based on Google ’s Android operating system. Google is also said to be working on an Android platform for VR and MR devices and Zuckerberg said that he will welcome Google Play apps on Meta Horizon OS devices, ""if they're up for it.""Meta said the Meta Horizon OS includes Horizon Store, renamed from Quest Store, to download apps and experiences. The platform will work with a mobile companion app now called Meta Horizon app.For years, Meta has complained against Apple's App Store restrictions, and Zuckerberg even criticised Apple Vision Pro headset.“In every era of computing, there are always open and closed models. With phones, Apple’s closed model basically won out. Phones are tightly controlled, and you’re locked into what they’ll let you do. But it doesn’t have to be this way,” Zuckerberg said.“Our goal is to make it said that the open model defines the next generation of computing again with the metaverse, glasses and headsets,” Zuckerberg said.","Facebook parent company Meta has announced that it will offer Horizon OS – the software that powers its Meta Quest devices to third-party hardware makers.

A captivating romance can uplift anyone's spirits, and anime has a unique ability to vividly portray these narratives. Over the years, Japanese animation has delivered numerous romantic tales, ranging from light-hearted comedies to deeply emotional dramas.For romance enthusiasts, going through the vast array of anime options can be overwhelming. However, there are several exceptional romance anime series that truly shine above the rest.Here is a curated list of top romance anime series , compiled by Game Rant, along with their respective rankings.Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie stirred mixed reactions upon its debut in Spring 2022, often compared to ""My Dress-Up Darling"" but standing out as a unique slice-of-life anime centred around a charming couple, Shikimori and Yuu Izumi.One distinctive aspect of the series is its portrayal of the main couple already in a relationship, a rarity in anime. While the episodes focus on everyday moments, they paint a wholesome picture of young love with two endearing characters navigating the nuances of romance.Describing Bakemonogatari as a straightforward romance might be a stretch, but this instalment of Monogatari indeed focuses on and highlights the relationship between Koyomi Araragi and Hitagi Senjougahara. Their initial interactions are unconventional, involving a stapler to the face, but Araragi's determination to assist Senjougahara with her curse ultimately brings them closer.Despite the surreal and eccentric nature of Monogatari, the romance between Araragi and Senjougahara is remarkably grounded and healthy. While the series introduces other potential romantic interests, their relationship remains steadfast and central to the narrative.""Sing 'Yesterday' for Me"" presents romance in a refreshingly realistic manner compared to many other anime. The series takes a classic love triangle and steers it in an unexpected direction by the end, resulting in a highly satisfying conclusion that portrays how failed romances can evolve into strong friendships.Directed by Yoshiyuki Fujiwara, known for his work on popular anime like ""Attack on Titan"" and ""Sword Art Online,"" the shift to a show with such a different tone demonstrates his versatility and mastery in storytelling across diverse genres.""My Happy Marriage"" emerged as one of the standout romance anime of Summer 2023, adapted from Akumi Agitogi's novel series. Set in an alternate Meiji Restoration era with supernatural elements, the story follows Miyo, who endures mistreatment from her stepfamily despite her privileged background. Her family arranges her marriage to a notorious military figure known for rejecting wives quickly, with rejection spelling disaster for Miyo. However, Kiyoka surprises everyone by taking an interest in Miyo and becoming incensed by her family's cruelty.The anime delves into the lasting impact of Miyo's abuse, highlighting her struggle to regain self-worth, even with Kiyoka's support. Kiyoka himself is a complex character with hidden motives behind his initial attraction to Miyo, although his feelings for her are genuine.While the romance between Miyo and Kiyoka is heartwarming, ""My Happy Marriage"" falls short in other areas. The supernatural elements can seem disjointed, and the villains are one-dimensional despite being detestable.Based on Fumita Yanagida's popular and finished manga, ""Tomo-chan Is a Girl!"" stood out as one of Winter 2023's most amusing romantic comedies. Tomo and Jun share a close friendship, but Jun sees Tomo strictly as a friend, unaware of her romantic feelings.While romance is central to its characters, ""Tomo-chan Is a Girl!"" leans heavily into comedy. Tomo and Jun's dynamic is charming, and they're supported by entertaining characters like Misuzu and Carol. Despite its comedic tone, the chemistry between Tomo and Jun develops convincingly over the season. Unlike some romance anime, Tomo-chan excels in portraying why its leads are compatible without difficulty.Teen romance anime often dominate the genre, but there are exceptions worth noting. ""Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku"" is primarily a workplace comedy that revolves around two couples: the newly formed pair of Hirotaka Nifuji and Narumi Momose, and the more established couple, Tarou Kabakura and Hanako Koyanagi. The focus remains on Hirotaka and Narumi, with the series emphasising humour over romance, but Tarou and Hanako's relationship is depicted realistically.Despite being childhood friends, Narumi struggles to see Hirotaka as a potential romantic interest, a dynamic that persists throughout the series. The anime's brevity limits the depth of these relationships, but ""Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku"" provides an entertaining journey within its runtime.""Romantic Killer"" cleverly parodies romance and harem anime while paying homage to their core strengths. Anzu, a girl with no interest in boys, is suddenly thrust into a reverse harem scenario by a magical being, disrupting her life of gaming and chocolate consumption. Unamused by her newfound romantic entanglements with unfamiliar guys, Anzu navigates this unconventional situation with scepticism.Primarily a comedy, ""Romantic Killer"" aims to elicit laughter from its audience, often succeeding with its humour rooted in its origins as a shonen manga, characterised by exaggerated facial expressions.Though not always aiming for emotional depth, the anime treats its characters and their relationships seriously. Anzu shines as a compelling lead, and the male characters introduced as potential partners are well-developed. ""Romantic Killer"" offers a delightful blend of humour and romance for those seeking an entertaining and unconventional love story.""The Angel Next Door Spoils Me Rotten"" captivates viewers from the start for several reasons. Firstly, Project No.9's animation is impressive, featuring clean and detailed character designs. Secondly, and most importantly, the main characters exhibit instant chemistry, evident when Amane offers his umbrella to a soaked Mahiru, sparking a connection.Throughout the series, despite the frequent presence of both leads on screen, ""The Angel Next Door Spoils Me Rotten"" effectively delves into their individual personalities while also developing their friendship.Rumiko Takahashi is celebrated as a legendary mangaka, known for classics like Inuyasha, Ranma 1/2, and Urusei Yatsura. While most of her renowned works fall within the shonen genre, Takahashi has also ventured into seinen storytelling. Maison Ikkoku stands out as one of her most mature works, emphasising romance as its primary theme.Unlike Takahashi's prominent shonen series that explore various genres such as comedy and action alongside romance, Maison Ikkoku focuses squarely on romantic elements, enriched with drama, character development, and humour.The central relationship features Kyouko and Yuusaku, both drawn to each other but hindered by their circumstances. Kyouko, grieving the recent loss of her husband, is hesitant to move forward. Meanwhile, Yuusaku, deeply in love with Kyouko, doubts his worthiness as a student. The anime chronicles their journeys of growth, healing, and mutual misunderstanding, complemented by well-developed secondary characters.Insomniacs After School emerged as the standout romance of Spring 2023, adapted from Makoto Ojiro's esteemed seinen manga. The story revolves around two students plagued by insomnia, a burden they carried alone until they met at their school's observatory. Isaki and Ganta form an immediate bond, which deepens as they work together to revive the Astronomy Club, driven by their shared need to preserve their newfound sanctuary.The anime boasts impeccable pacing, skillfully depicting the protagonists' isolation due to insomnia and the subtle solace they find in each other. While romance is a central theme, the series prioritises developing Ganta and Isaki's friendship before advancing their relationship, emphasising the depth of their connection beyond shared circumstances.Kokoro Connect injects a supernatural twist into a classic love triangle scenario. The story centers around Taichi, Iori, Yui, Yoshifumi, and Himeko, students of the Student Cultural Research Club, whose lives take a turn when they receive supernatural abilities from a mysterious being named Heartseed.As they grapple with these newfound powers, the group experiences sensory phenomena that challenge their relationships and reveal hidden aspects of their personalities. The anime is rich in character development, providing an engaging and thought-provoking experience.Maid Sama! carries many tropes that might derail other romance anime: an overly perfect male lead, a strong female protagonist reduced to a damsel, and an unnecessary love triangle. Despite these shortcomings, Maid Sama! shines through its strong personality.The heart of Maid Sama! lies in the relationship between Takumi Usui, a charming heartthrob, and Misaki Ayuzawa, a strict student council president with a busy schedule balancing school, home, and work. When Takumi discovers Misaki's secret job at a maid cafe, it opens a new perspective on the usually composed president.In ""Rascal Does Not Dream Of Bunny Girl Senpai,"" romance plays a subtle yet compelling role that defines the series. The story centers on Sakuta Azusagawa, a high school student drawn to girls suffering from Adolescence Syndrome, a condition linked to their insecurities.While the anime unfolds through different arcs focusing on various girls, the standout is the initial saga featuring Mai Sakurajima, an actress who forms a close bond with Sakuta. Their dynamic crackles with romantic tension, warmth, and clever banter. Although not always in the foreground, their relationship develops steadily across subsequent arcs, leading to a satisfying sequel in the form of a feature film.Wakana Gojou and Marin Kitagawa inhabit completely contrasting worlds. Gojou, isolated and reserved, keeps himself apart from others due to his passion for hina dolls, fearing ridicule. In contrast, Kitagawa is popular, outgoing, and self-assured.Despite their differences, Kitagawa becomes intrigued by cosplay and sees Gojou as the ideal person to create outfits for her. ""My Dress-Up Darling"" is a charming, humorous, and beautifully animated romance anime that excels in executing classic genre tropes with finesse.""Toradora!"" is a beloved slice-of-life romantic comedy that offers a wonderful entry point into the genre. The story revolves around Ryuji Yusaku and Taiga Aisaka, two students who have crushes on each other's best friends.Both Ryuji and Taiga are viewed as outcasts—Ryuji due to his intimidating appearance and Taiga because of her fiery temper. They team up to assist each other in their romantic pursuits. The series delves into their evolving dynamic and the humorous mishaps that ensue as they navigate their intertwined love lives.""The Pet Girl of Sakurasou"" depicts the journey of an eccentric group of characters as they navigate growth and self-discovery. Sorata Kanda is forced to move into the unconventional Sakura House after being kicked out of his school's main dorms.In Sakura House, Sorata encounters talented yet troubled students. When a peculiar young artist joins the dorm, Sorata takes on the responsibility of helping her adjust to her new life. The series delves into the interactions among the dorm mates, their personal aspirations, and the interconnected nature of their relationships.""Ouran High School Host Club"" is a delightful reverse harem anime filled with lighthearted and meaningful moments. Haruhi Fujioka accidentally breaks an antique vase belonging to her school's Host Club and must repay her debt by disguising herself as a boy and working as a host.The series excels in developing Haruhi's character along with her fellow hosts, providing insight into their motivations and personalities. It's a must-watch for shojo fans, featuring a memorable cast of characters that carries the show through its run.Kyoto Animation has produced many beloved anime, and ""Love, Chunibyo & Other Delusions!"" is among them. The series centers around a phenomenon known as Chunibyo, where adolescents have grandiose and unrealistic delusions.Yuta Togashi, who has outgrown his delusional phase, aims for a normal high school life. However, things take a turn when his classmate, Rikka Takanashi, reminds him of his past and tries to pull him back into the world of Chunibyo with her own delusions. The series delves into their relationship as Yuta unravels the triggers behind Rikka's delusions.The trope of opposites attracting may be overused, but when done well, it can lead to a captivating romantic comedy. ""Kimi ni Todoke"" explores the endearing friendship between the shy Sawako Kuronuma and the popular Shouta Kazehaya. Sawako, often mistaken for Sadako from ""The Ring,"" is isolated at school due to her appearance, making it challenging for her to break out of her shell. Fortunately, Kazehaya is just the right person to help her.""Kimi ni Todoke"" is a delightful and heartwarming anime with well-developed characters who evolve as the story unfolds. While it adheres to typical romance anime pacing, the journey remains engaging and enjoyable.Unlike most romance stories that focus on the process of falling in love, ""Tonikawa: Over The Moon For You"" follows a married couple who have already reached that point. As a result, the anime adopts a slice-of-life approach, showcasing Nasa and Tsukasa's daily life and antics rather than a typical romantic journey. ""Tonikawa"" doesn't rely on dramatic highs but instead offers a pleasant and light-hearted experience.While this anime may not appeal to everyone, it serves as a refreshing departure from more melodramatic romance shows. Despite their tendency to blush at the slightest physical contact, Nasa and Tsukasa are refreshingly direct in expressing their feelings, making them both witty and likeable characters.This romantic anime shines because of its main character, Takeo Gouda. His towering, imposing presence contrasts beautifully with his heartfelt affection for the delicate Rinko, which is truly heartwarming. Takeo's efforts to play matchmaker for Rinko with his best friend, despite his own feelings, demonstrate his genuine kindness.Viewers will undoubtedly root for Takeo and Rinko's endearing relationship. ""My Love Story!!"" delivers the goods without delay, as the main characters are dating for most of the episodes, bypassing the typical slow build-up to a confession.""A Sign of Affection"" is a heartwarming romantic comedy centred on college-age love and the challenges of communication. While not the sole focus of the story, Yuki and Itsuomi stand out as the main couple, instantly captivating viewers. Yuki, who is hearing-impaired, communicates using sign language, text, and by reading lips, while Itsuomi is a world traveller passionate about learning languages. Their connection begins on a train and grows stronger with each subsequent encounter.The anime beautifully captures the intense emotions of falling in love, highlighted by a poignant moment in the opening episode. With an older cast, ""A Sign of Affection"" takes on a more mature tone compared to typical romance anime. Throughout the season, Yuki and Itsuomi become increasingly comfortable around each other, resulting in consistently endearing interactions.This romantic anime is ideal for LGBTQ+ viewers seeking representation on screen, but its well-crafted storytelling makes it enjoyable for all audiences. The heartwarming romance blossoms between Mafuyu and Ritsuka as Mafuyu learns to play guitar and sing in Ritsuka's band.Watching Mafuyu's growing confidence alongside the romantic tension creates a compelling series that's hard to resist. The accompanying movie is also outstanding and a must-watch continuation of the series.Nana is one of the most renowned and beloved shoujo anime of all time, a must-watch for fans of romance and beyond. The series follows two women named Nana, seemingly different but navigating curiously similar life situations that lead to separate outcomes.Without giving away how their stories intertwine, Nana's 47 episodes delve into the protagonists' perspectives on love through various relationships. Grounded in reality, the anime explores complex characters who, despite occasional extremes, face accountability for their actions.Your Lie in April, one of the most famous romance anime, revolves around two music prodigies: Kousei Arima and Kaori Miyazono. Kousei, grappling with depression after his mother's death, loses his passion for the piano and withdraws from the performance arts. One day, he hears Kaori playing her violin with such freedom that it reignites his love for music and sparks his admiration for her.The anime delves into themes of grief, life, love, and music. Kousei's journey toward self-healing is profound, marked by heartbreak, but also punctuated by moments of beauty, tenderness, and joy.In this anime, Miyuki and Kaguya engage in a battle of wits to avoid confessing their love first, using their intellect and skills to outmaneuver each other. Both are determined not to be seen as the one who gives in.Their antics running the student council at an elite school with their friends are uproariously funny yet also contain heartwarming moments that will make viewers cheer. Season 3 of Kaguya-sama: Love is War, which aired in Spring 2022, leaned heavily into comedy but also devoted more time to developing Miyuki and Kaguya's relationship and touching on other romances.If the anime follows the manga, the next season of Love is War promises to be predominantly romantic. If successful, this upcoming release could elevate Kaguya-sama to the pinnacle of romance anime.This anime consists of two parts: Clannad and After Story. The latter surpasses the former by a wide margin, but watching Clannad is essential to fully appreciate the impact of After Story. While it features a diverse cast of supporting characters, the heart of the show revolves around Tomoya Okazaki and Nagisa Furukawa, delivering a profound narrative.Unlike typical romance series, Clannad After Story unfolds beyond high school, depicting the growth of Tomoya and Nagisa as individuals and as a couple. The anime tackles real-life challenges without glossing over them, offering a genuine exploration of common struggles.The Dangers in My Heart is truly brilliant. At first glance, it may seem like another typical shounen romance where a popular girl falls for an ordinary loner guy. These stories often offer little beyond wish fulfilment, and The Dangers in My Heart initially appears to fit that mould. Yet, the anime stands out.Ichikawa is an average guy with few friends who daydreams about unusual things. While the anime doesn't delve deeply into these thoughts, it doesn't ignore them either, leaving Ichikawa with a poor first impression. On the other hand, Anna is a cheerful but shy girl who loves food and works as a model. After a chance encounter at the school library, the two start spending time together, developing a friendship that hints at something deeper. Anna encourages Ichikawa to break out of his shell, leading to significant changes in him over the course of two seasons.Although slow-paced initially, The Dangers in My Heart evolves into something special by the end of season 1, maintaining its momentum in the subsequent cour and establishing itself as one of the best romance anime of all time. Anna and Ichikawa are both exceptional characters, but Anna's depth is what elevates the show. She's not just an idealised plot device; she's a fully realised character with insecurities, quirks, and vulnerabilities. Her interest in Ichikawa feels genuine, and vice versa. This is a rare quality in romance anime.Fruits Basket is the definitive romance anime, masterfully blending drama and comedy. Tooru Honda, a lovable protagonist, faces life's challenges until she moves in with the Souma family. The Soumas, particularly Yuki, are school idols hiding a shocking secret that alters perceptions.Love triangles often lack depth, favouring one partner over the other. Fruits Basket defies this norm with its compelling love triangle, where each character is fully developed. Across three seasons, Fruits Basket takes viewers on an unforgettable journey.Also read | GTA 5 cheat codes: List of Grand Theft Auto 5 cheat codes for PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox consoles","Japanese animation has delivered numerous romantic tales, ranging from light- hearted comedies to deeply emotional dramas.

Sunil Mittal: This is what Bharti Group chairman Sunil Mittal has to say on Vodafone-Idea raising funds,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/this-is-what-bharti-group-chairman-sunil-mittal-has-to-say-on-vodafone-idea-raising-funds/articleshow/109485792.cms,"India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO)

5G rollout

plans of Vodafone-Idea

Bharti Enterprises chairman Sunil Mittal has reiterated his stand that a market with three private telecom companies is optimal for India. Talking to Economic Times, Mittal said, ""My position has been consistent that three private operators are ideal for India,"" Mittal told ET. His comments come in the backdrop of Vi moving to secure its much-delayed funding.Mittal made the statement as debt-laden Vodafone Idea (Vi) got a financial lifeline allaying fears of a duopoly in the telecom sector .Vodafone-idea is planning to raise as much as Rs 45,000 crore through a mix of equity and debt. The company has come out with one of India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO) of Rs 18,000 crore. The FPO opened for subscription late last week (April 18). Vodafone-Idea announced FPO worth Rs 18,000 crore, in addition to the recent Rs 2,000 crore preferential equity issuance to promoters.The company owes Rs 2.1 lakh crore debt to the government, with a large part of it under moratorium until 1HFY26. Post the equity fund-raise, govt shareholding will fall to 24% from 32%.Ahead of its FPO, Vodafone Idea said that it expects to roll out 5G services in select pockets in 6-9 months of the issue. Its CEO Akshaya Moondra said that rollout of the 5G services is one of the objectives of raising the capital from the public and once the funding comes, it will start work on the rollout.According to an ET report, the 5G rollout will cover 40 per cent of the company's overall revenue base in the next 24-30 months, Moondra said, without sharing a specific target on when the rollout will happen. A sum of Rs 5,720 crore has been allocated for the rollout, he said, adding that testing and vendor conversations have already begun.Analysts said fresh capital-raising will allow Vodafone-Idea to bolster its fortunes, putting to rest fears around a duopoly in the telecom sector at least for the time being. They, however, at the same time said that it still is a long road ahead for the telco and won't just be a cakewalk.","Mittal made the statement as debt-laden Vodafone Idea (Vi) got a financial lifeline allaying fears of a duopoly in the telecom sector. The company has come out with one of India's largest follow-on public offering (FPO) of Rs 18,000 crore.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109485788,imgsize-32876,width-400,resizemode-4/109485788.jpg"

Playing Fallout 76 solo can present challenges if you're unfamiliar with the gameplay dynamics. Released in 2018 as the inaugural multiplayer instalment in the Fallout series, it was initially tailored for cooperative play. However, solo play has since become more accessible and enjoyable. Despite the presence of multiplayer events and nuclear weapons, solo players can still have a rewarding experience.To kickstart your solo adventure in Fallout 76, consider these helpful tips for navigating the wasteland alone.When playing Fallout 76 solo, it's important to regularly check the map to monitor the locations of other players, displayed as small dots. This allows you to avoid unwanted interactions with others. However, be prepared for combat if you do get attacked. When exploring confined spaces like tunnels or buildings, it's advisable to carry a melee weapon for close-quarters combat.Exploration is key in solo play in Fallout 76. Start by avoiding densely populated areas like Flatwoods to minimise encounters with other players. Defeating enemies will yield low-level weaponry and other loot. By exploring extensively, you'll discover valuable loot such as armour, weapons, and resources. Look for fallen trees and log piles in the environment to gather wood scraps, which are essential for crafting wood armour.Exploration is crucial when playing Fallout 76 solo. To minimise encounters with other players, avoid densely populated areas like Flatwoods initially. Defeating enemies will yield low-level weaponry and other loot, including armour, weapons, and resources. Search the environment for fallen trees and log piles to collect wood scraps, which are essential for crafting wood armour.Player versus player (PvP) interactions can be significant in Fallout 76. When playing solo, it's advisable to avoid unnecessary fights. Activating Pacifist Mode prevents you from causing harm to other players. If another player kills you while Pacifist Mode is active, they are marked as a murderer on the map, attracting a bounty on their head. Although Pacifist Mode doesn't guarantee complete safety, it's a useful feature that you can enable or disable at your convenience.Players can travel without cost by using the C.A.M.P. (Construction and Assembly Mobile Platform). Collect junk and construct a basic C.A.M.P. with necessary amenities like workbenches, sleeping bags, a turret, and a cooking station. By setting up your C.A.M.P. strategically along important fast-travel locations, you gain convenient access to crafting stations and save on extra caps when travelling.Public Events are typically geared towards multiplayer groups, encouraging many players to collaborate on tasks for rewarding benefits. However, when playing solo, it's advisable to steer clear of these events due to the inherent risks. Without a teammate to watch your back, participating in public events can be challenging. While they can be enjoyable, consider joining them only if you're comfortable with the presence of other players.As a solo player in Fallout 76, it's important to ensure that you are at a higher level than the enemies you encounter. You'll be tackling creatures and quests on your own, so aim to level up as much as possible before diving into the main quests on your Pip-Boy. It's recommended to reach at least Level 30 before embarking on these challenges. While grinding for experience might seem tedious, every activity in the game, from cooking and exploring to building and crafting, earns you XP and is well worth the effort.Use sneak attacks to your advantage while playing Fallout 76 solo, as they deal double damage. When facing challenging situations, hiding and using stealth can be your best strategy. Sneaking not only allows you to deal more damage but also enables you to heal gradually, switch weapons, and gain an upper hand in combat. Leveraging sneak attacks is one of the most effective combat tactics when venturing solo in the game.In Fallout 76, Perks are acquired randomly through card packs, and they can be a valuable investment for solo players when used effectively. Consider investing in Luck and selecting Perks that enhance item discovery, such as Pharma Farma, which increases the chance of finding more chems by 40%. It's wise for players to plan their character's build early and customise their perk deck to align with their preferred play style.Explosives in Fallout 76 deliver high area-of-effect (AoE) damage, particularly effective when enemies are close to the blast's centre. They excel at taking down groups of enemies, providing solo players with an advantage against multiple foes. Strategically using explosives can be crucial when outnumbered, such as placing mines or throwing grenades when enemies cluster together to inflict substantial damage and gain the upper hand in combat.While it's generally advisable to avoid group activities, taking part in Nuke events is an exception in Fallout 76. Before joining, equip a rad suit or power armour and remain outside the blast zone when the Nuke strikes. After the blast, legendary creatures will emerge in the area, offering special weapons and armour as rewards. You don't necessarily have to defeat these creatures entirely; instead, focus on dealing some damage to claim their loot. Continue engaging the beasts, allowing larger teams to finish them off while you collect the rewards."," Fallout 76 was released in 2018 as the inaugural multiplayer instalment in the Fallout series. Despite the presence of multiplayer events and nuclear weapons, solo players can still have a rewarding experience. When playing Fallout 76 solo, it's important to regularly check the map to monitor the locations of other players, displayed as small dots.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109481779,imgsize-25426,width-400,resizemode-4/109481779.jpg"
