These will be accessible for Gemini for Google Workspace add-on subscribers.“Google Workspace admins can now opt-in to beta test Gemini Extensions for Gmail and Drive for their organisation. Via the Drive extension, organisations can also access information from Google Docs,” the company said in an announcement.This means that when enabled, Gemini will be able to cross reference, or to pull data from, these apps as sources to provide contextual information in its responses.Those subscribers who will be using this capability will be able to find and summarise information, as well as ground Gemini’s responses, from their own content.“Now, Google Workspace users can collaborate with information from select Google Workspace apps, all in one place, bringing Gemini’s capabilities into user’s daily workflows, enhancing productivity and collaboration,” it added.For example, you can ask Gemini to pull a specific data sheet (Google Doc) from Drive, analyse it, and send an email to your colleague after summarising the data.The company says that Google Workspace data will not be used to train Gemini’s public model, and admins have the capability to disable access at any time. This feature will be OFF by default and can be enabled at the OU or Group level.Full rollout for Rapid Release and Scheduled Release domains has been started.

"OpenAI has trained AI models to produce text that humans can easily understand, here’s how",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/openai-has-trained-ai-models-to-produce-text-that-humans-can-easily-understand-heres-how/articleshow/111870808.cms,"How OpenAI found a solution to this problem

Tech companies like Google and ChatGPT maker OpenAI are pushing innovation to enhance the output provided by chatbots . By harnessing the power of AI, machine learning and advanced data analytics, they are optimising language models to improve the responses. In one such case, OpenAI has reported a breakthrough in which the company trained strong language models to produce text that is easy for weak language models to verify.The Microsoft-backed company found that this training also made the text easier for humans to evaluate.“Making sure that language models produce understandable text is crucial to making them helpful for people, especially when dealing with complex tasks like solving math problems,” OpenAI said in a blog this week.The company said that it found that despite its AI models spitting out factually correct answers, they were harder to understand.“When we asked human evaluators with limited time to assess these highly optimised solutions, they made nearly twice as many errors compared to when they evaluated less optimised solutions. This finding highlights the importance of not just correctness, but also clarity and ease of verification in AI-generated text,” it added.OpenAI trained advanced language models to create text that weaker models can easily verify, which humans could also evaluate more effectively – a process called improving legibility. The company deployed a ‘prover-verifier game’ wherein two players: a ""prover"" that generates a solution and a ""verifier"" that checks it for accuracy.“To improve legibility, we optimise chain-of-thoughts on grade-school math problems to be verifiable by weaker models and study whether this makes them more legible to humans. This training procedure is inspired by the Prover-Verifier Game, a game-theoretic framework to encourage learning agents to solve decision problems in a verifiable manner,” OpenAI said.OpenAI says it used a training scheme in which a strong model produced solutions that a much weaker model, the verifier, can easily verify – large and small models from the GPT-4 family.","OpenAI trained language models to produce text that weaker models can easily verify.

This has triggered a domino effect, placing extraordinary strain on Microsoft's data centres and network infrastructure, subsequently affecting Microsoft Azure and Microsoft 365 services.CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz clarified that the incident was not a security breach or cyberattack. ""Today was not a security or cyber incident. Our customers remain fully protected,"" Kurtz said.

Apple was the first brand to integrate satellite messaging technology into the smartphones. The iPhone 14 series was the first and now Google is also planning to bring a similar feature to the Android ecosystem. According to a report by Android Authority, Google is planning to integrate Satellite connectivity within the Android 15 platform that will allow users to stay connected in case of emergency even in areas without cellular coverage.An APK teardown, done by Android Authority, of the latest Android 15 beta 4 reveals references to this feature, likely to be named ""Pixel Satellite SOS."" The strings in the code suggest that this service will be offered free for the first two years for Pixel devices , similar to Apple's offering. The specifics shared in the teardown indicate that when connecting to emergency services via satellite, a user's personal information, including name, email, phone number, location, and device details, will be transmitted to emergency services and satellite providers.To utilise the Satellite SOS feature, Google Messages must be set as the default SMS app. The strings also hint that while the Pixel 9 series will likely launch with this feature, older Pixel models may not support it due to hardware limitations. However, the possibility exists that older Pixels could receive updates to support satellite communication through future Pixel Feature Drops.Google’s move to include satellite connectivity aims to stay competitive with Apple's emergency satellite feature , offering similar functionality and a comparable free service period. This could prove beneficial for users who find themselves in remote areas with no cellular service, providing a crucial lifeline during emergencies.","Google is planning to integrate Satellite connectivity within the Android 15 platform.

What HCLTech CEO Vijayakumar said on linking variable pay to office attendance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/what-hcltech-ceo-c-vijayakumar-said-on-linking-variable-pay-to-office-attendance/articleshow/111774260.cms,"Tata Consultancy Services ( TCS ) recently reported a close to 70% of employees returning to office after the company linked variable pay to attendance. IT giant HCLTech , however, has no plans to do the same. In an interview with Money Control, chief executive officer (CEO) C Vijayakumar said that the company has “no such plans to link variable compensation with bringing people to office”.“Return to office continues to increase, and it varies from business line to business line.Some business lines, we're able to comfortably work remotely. And for some business lines, we think getting people back to work is the right strategy. We don't have any such plans to link variable compensation with bringing people to office,” Vijayakumar said.The report also quotes HCLTech chief people officer Ramachandran Sundararajan who said during the company’s Q1 earnings conference on July 12 that variable pay is not a big cost for the IT company. “The quarterly variable pay is only applicable for the junior level employees and not the mid and senior levels.

There are continued opportunities to build India centres for global clients. It's only some very large institutions, especially very large banks, who can build a big scale in India, are those who are likely to insource a little bit more.”He stated that the company’s dip in growth in engineering, research and development (ER&D) and in financial services will bounce back from the third quarter. “..although the next three quarters of the fiscal year ending March 2025 are likely to remain subdued as in FY24,” he added.Vijayakumar also highlighted that investments in generative artificial intelligence (AI) will bring the next discretionary spend growth. The Noida-based IT major is working on around 200 proofs of concept in GenAI which are already contributing to its revenue.“It will continue to scale. I think the next discretionary spend growth will come from GenAI-related investments, I would think. I think the efficiency aspects are generally getting built into contracts but GenAI is much more than efficiency kind of a lever,” Vijayakumar told ET in the video interview.",Tata Consultancy Services recently linked variable pay to attendance.

How Amazon’s ‘dirty diapers mistake’ killed this multi-million dollar family business,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-amazons-dirty-diapers-mistake-killed-this-multi-million-dollar-family-business/articleshow/111812571.cms,"‘Damaging review’ stayed for years

What Amazon said

A small family business selling washable swim diapers on Amazon was ruined after the e-commerce giant resold a used, faeces-stained diaper to a customer, according to a report from Bloomberg.Paul and Rachelle Baron , owners of Beau & Belle Littles, say their once-thriving company has been devastated by a single one-star review left in 2020. The customer received a diaper ""covered in poop stains"" that Amazon had apparently failed to inspect before reselling as new.The review, which included photos of the soiled diaper, quickly gained traction as other shoppers marked it ""helpful."" This boosted its visibility in the e-commerce platform's algorithm, overshadowing hundreds of positive reviews.""The last four years have been an emotional train wreck,"" Paul Baron told Bloomberg. The couple says they are now $600,000 in debt, barely making enough to pay down loans and order inventory.Amazon's policy requires inspection of all returned items before resale. However, consultants told Bloomberg that selling used products as new is a growing problem on the platform. The sheer volume of returns makes thorough inspection difficult, according to a former Amazon employee.Despite repeated pleas from the Barons, Amazon reportedly refused to remove the damaging review for years. The company finally took it down hours after Bloomberg published its report on Monday.In a statement to Bloomberg, Amazon spokesperson Chris Oster said they have since improved their returns process and updated policies to prevent resale of certain returned products. He called such incidents ""extremely rare.""While Amazon’s marketplace provides small businesses access to millions of customers, the case highlights that sellers have little recourse when things go wrong. Some critics say Amazon's algorithms and review system can amplify isolated incidents, potentially ruining businesses over a single mistake.For the Barons, who once appeared on national television as an Amazon success story, the damage has already been done. They are now seeking additional work to make ends meet.""Amazon talks a big game about helping small businesses,"" Paul Baron said. ""But they really don't.""","Beau & Belle Littles, a small business selling washable swim diapers, was ruined by a single one-star review left in 2020.

Government suspends these two telemarketing companies over sending 5.5 million fraud SMSes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/government-suspends-these-two-telemarketing-companies-over-fraud-smses/articleshow/111823013.cms,"The duo sent over 5mn fraud SMSes since Jan, 2024, DoT claims

What the companies has to say about it?

Amid rising SMS frauds in the country, the department of telecommunications ( DoT ) has suspended operations of two telemarketing companies, namely V-con Intelligent Security and OneXtel Media, reports Economic Times. In its direction dated July 15, the telecom department said that the two misused their platform to send malicious and phishing SMSes, the report states.“In the interest of safeguarding the citizens from cybercrime/financial frauds, all the TSPs (telecom service providers) are directed to: immediately suspend these two RTMs (registered telemarketers )…(and) lodge police complaint against them for misusing DLT platform for sending malicious and phishing SMSes,” read the DoT direction.V-con - a part of the Videocon Group, and OneXtel Media were found responsible for sending 55.5 million fraudulent SMSes to smartphone users since January 2024. DoT’s action comes after receiving several complaints filed by telecom users on the Chakshu portal about malicious SMSes.Quoting officials involved in the investigations, the ET report states that the DoT ordered blacklisting of 131 principal entities (PEs), 5,000 SMS content templates, and 700 SMS headers. However, the fraud senders came up with new headers to cheat the blockchain-based SMS filtering system.The ET report says that it was also found that one among these two entities – V-con and OneXtel – had received money from bank accounts that were involved in multiple complaints of organised transnational crimes, including illegal stock investment frauds.As per the report, OneXtel has strongly opposed the government’s suspension on grounds that the company was not given any opportunity to present its case. Abrar Chunawala, chief executive of OneXtel Media said “We are in cognizance of DoT’s order but also surprised on how the government has casted the burden on a reputed telemarketer like us operating since nine years. It must be noted that we were never intimated about the department’s action, no show-cause notice was served.”“The 55.5 million ballpark figure given in the order, presumably is for 6 months and belongs to two entities. Let’s assume 17 million of these were passed through Onextel. This represents only 0.06% of our total traffic. Is it then fair to suddenly put a company out of business for such a small percentage? As per regulation, it is the responsibility of telecom companies to operate the DLT system. Are they not at fault along with their DLT tech partners?” Chunawala added.",V-con Intelligent Security and OneXtel Media were found responsible for sending 55.5 million fraudulent SMSes to smartphone users since January 2024.

Ashneer Grover , founder of BharatPe and ex-Shark Tank judge recently sat for a podcast interview with YouTuber Ishan Sharma. During the interview, Grover shared his thoughts about the hiring process stating that he does not believe in lengthy hiring process and notice periods. He said that he believes in ‘ hire fast, fire fast ’ rule.When asked about how he hires and manages people, Grover said that he has personally not experienced 100% success in hiring the right candidate.“What I have basically understood about hiring, and a lot of people don’t agree with this thought, it’s hire fast, fire fast,” he said in the podcast.Explaining further, he added “What’s happening currently is that you are investing a lot of time in hiring a person, you go through multiple rounds. The candidate is also, naturally, at his best behaviour. When a candidate comes to sell himself or pitch for himself, then the salesman in him is at its peak. At the end of the day, you will get to know whether he will work or not only after you give him his tasks,”.“Sometimes people are able to sell themselves very well. My realisation is this – we spend 3 months identifying the ideal candidate, then the candidate serves his 2 months of notice period, so we wait for those 2 months. We, at this point, have already invested around 6 months into this role. Once the candidate joins, we want to give him the same amount of time to prove himself. So from 6 months, now it is 1 year.”“After a year, you realise he is not a good fit. I think the best thing to do is to do local optimisation, you decide you need a candidate in a week-15 days, you get him in fast. Judge him on his work faster. And it is very simple to understand who works and who does not. So, hire fast and fire fast,” Grover said in the podcast.","BharatPe founder and ex-Shark Tank judge Ashneer Grover sat for a podcast interview with YouTuber Ishan Sharma.
