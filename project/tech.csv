No official statement yet

Popular YouTuber and influencer Ranveer Allahbadia has fallen victim to a cyber attack that resulted in both of his YouTube channels being hacked and renamed ""Tesla”. Also, all the videos available on both the channels were deleted.The hackers reporetedly used a deceptive livestream featuring an AI-generated Elon Musk avatar, urging viewers to invest cryptocurrency for a false promise of doubling their returns.The avatar directs viewers to scan a QR code and deposit Bitcoin or Ethereum on a suspicious website, elonweb.net. This tactic is a classic ""Bitcoin doubling"" scam, commonly used in cyberattacks targeting high-profile YouTube channels.The channels have been deleted from YouTube. Previously, when we attempted to search for the channels, YouTube displayed a message stating that they had been removed due to a violation of the company's policies. However, now the live streaming platform shows a message, ‘This page isn't available. Sorry about that. Try searching for something else.’Allahbadia has not yet issued an official statement regarding the hack. His most recent post on X (formerly known as Twitter) was shared 14 hours ago. The post is a short video from his podcast on communal harmony.","Both of Ranveer Allahbadia's YouTube channels were hacked and renamed ""Tesla"" Hackers used a deceptive livestream featuring an AI-generated Elon Musk avatar, urging viewers to invest cryptocurrency for a false promise of doubling their returns.

OpenAI’s CTO Mira Murati resigns: Read what CEO Sam Altman said,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/openais-cto-mira-murati-resigns-read-what-ceo-sam-altman-said/articleshow/113683777.cms,"Here’s what Mira Murti said

Hi all,

I have something to share with you. After much reflection, I have made the difficult decision to leave OpenAl. My six-and-a-half years with the OpenAl team have been an extraordinary privilege. While I'll express my gratitude to many individuals in the coming days, I want to start by thanking Sam and Greg for their trust in me to lead the technical organization and for their support throughout the years. There's never an ideal time to step away from a place one cherishes, yet this moment feels right. Our recent releases of speech-to-speech and OpenAl 01 mark the beginning of a new era in interaction and intelligence - achievements made possible by your ingenuity and craftsmanship. We didn't merely build smarter models, we fundamentally changed how Al systems learn and reason through complex problems. We brought safety research from the theoretical realm into practical applications, creating models that are more robust, aligned, and steerable than ever before. Our work has made cutting-edge Al research intuitive and accessible, developing technology that adapts and evolves based on everyone's input. This success is a testament to our outstanding teamwork, and it is because of your brilliance, your dedication, and your commitment that OpenAl stands at the pinnacle of AI innovation. I'm stepping away because I want to create the time and space to do my own exploration. For now, my primary focus is doing everything in my power to ensure a smooth transition, maintaining the momentum we've built.

I will forever be grateful for the opportunity to build and work alongside this remarkable team. Together, we've pushed the boundaries of scientific understanding in our quest to improve human well-being. While I may no longer be in the trenches with you, I will still be rooting for you all. With deep gratitude for the friendships forged, the triumphs achieved, and most importantly, the challenges overcome together.

Mira



What OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said

Hi All

Mira has been instrumental to OpenAI’s progress and growth the last 6.5 years; she has been a hugely significant factor in our development from an unknown research lab to an important company.

When Mira informed me this morning that she was leaving, I was saddened but of course support her decision. For the past year, she has been building out a strong bench of leaders that will continue our progress.

I also want to share that Bob and Barret have decided to depart OpenAI. Mira, Bob, and Barret made these decisions independently of each other and amicably, but the timing of Mira’s decision was such that it made sense to now do this all at once, so that we can work together for a smooth handover to the next generation of leadership.

I am extremely grateful to all of them for their contributions.

Being a leader at OpenAI is all-consuming. On one hand it’s a privilege to build AGI and be the fastest-growing company that gets to put our advanced research in the hands of hundreds of millions of people. On the other hand it’s relentless to lead a team through it—and they have gone above and beyond the call of duty for the company.

Mark is going to be our new SVP of Research and will now lead the research org in partnership with Jakub as Chief Scientist. This has been our long-term succession plan for Bob someday; although it’s happening sooner than we thought, I couldn’t be more excited that Mark is stepping into the role. Mark obviously has deep technical expertise, but he has also learned how to be a leader and manager in a very impressive way over the past few years.

Josh Achiam is going to take on a new role as Head of Mission Alignment, working across the company to ensure that we get all pieces (and culture) right to be in a place to succeed at the mission.

Kevin and Srinivas will continue to lead the Applied team.

Matt Knight will be our Chief Information Security Officer having already served in this capacity for a long time. This has been our plan for quite some time.

Mark, Jakub, Kevin, Srinivas, Matt, and Josh will report to me. I have over the past year or so spent most of my time on the non-technical parts of our organization; I am now looking forward to spending most of my time on the technical and product parts of the company.

...

Leadership changes are a natural part of companies, especially companies that grow so quickly and are so demanding. I obviously won’t pretend it’s natural for this one to be so abrupt, but we are not a normal company, and I think the reasons Mira explained to me (there is never a good time, anything not abrupt would have leaked, and she wanted to do this while OpenAI was in an upswing) make sense. We can both talk about this more tomorrow during all-hands.

Thank you for all of your hard work and dedication.

Sam

Sports and entertainment celebrities, and enterprises are reportedly showing major interest in food delivery company Swiggy through the unlisted market, ahead of its much-anticipated initial public offering (IPO). According to a report in Economic Times , quoting sorcs, Swiggy’s pre-IPO shares were actively traded in the unlisted market, with nearly 2 lakh shares already acquired by prominent individuals.These prominent individuals are reported to have acquired approximately 200,000 pre-IPO shares of Swiggy in recent transactions. These notable investors include cricketers Rahul Dravid and Zaheer Khan, tennis star Rohan Bopanna, filmmaker Karan Johar , and actor-entrepreneur Ashish Chowdhry.Swiggy has previously attracted investments from other Bollywood celebrities and entrepreneurs, including Madhuri Dixit Nene, Amitabh Bachchan, and Ritesh Malik.""I'm excited to support a company that's not only making a significant impact on the market but also contributing to the growth of India's tech ecosystem,"" said Zaheer Khan.The involvement of celebrities in Swiggy's pre-IPO shares reflects a broader trend of high-net-worth individuals seeking to diversify their portfolios with high-growth tech startups. Experts believe that celebrities are drawn to pre-IPO investments due to the potential for significant returns once the company goes public. Zomato's successful IPO in 2021 demonstrated the potential for substantial gains for early investors.Swiggy's planned IPO follows a series of successful fundraising rounds, attracting investments from global venture capital firms like SoftBank Vision Fund , Accel, and Prosus. The company has also raised capital through secondary market transactions, attracting a diverse group of investors, including Motilal Oswal Financial Services chairman Raamdeo Agrawal and automobile materials manufacturer Hindustan Composites.","Celebrities are reportedly showing major interest in food delivery company Swiggy through the unlisted market, ahead of its much-anticipated initial public offering (IPO) Experts believe that celebrities are drawn to pre-IPO investments due to the potential for significant returns once the company goes public.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113677346,imgsize-202504,width-400,resizemode-4/113677346.jpg"

Meta’s AI buddy just got a Hollywood makeover

AI to take over your Facebook and Instagram feed

Meta’s Ray-Ban smart glasses get smarter: Real-time translation and more

Meta's artificial intelligence just got a major upgrade. At the company's Connect event, Meta announced that its AI can now talk to you using celebrity voices, edit your photos, and even create personalised content for your social media feeds.Imagine chatting with an AI that sounds like John Cena or Dame Judi Dench. That's now possible if you're using WhatsApp Facebook , or Instagram in the United States.Meta AI can speak with voices from several celebrities, including Awkwafina, Keegan-Michael Key, and Kristen BellBut that's not all. Meta AI can now look at your photos and answer questions about them. Want to know how to make that cake in your picture? Just ask, and the AI will try to find a recipe for you. It can even change things in your photos, like swapping out your outfit or adding a rainbow to the background. This new capability is powered by Meta's latest AI model, Llama 3.2, which can understand both images and text.Meta also showed off a live demo of the AI video call feature that’ll let people chit chat with a creator’s AI personality.Meta is also testing something new for your Facebook and Instagram feeds. Soon, you might see AI-created images made just for you. These ""Imagined for You"" pictures could even include your face in fun scenarios, like being a video game character or an astronaut. Users will have the option to share these images or generate new ones in real-time.You can use the Meta AI on Instagram too, when you share a photo from your feed to your Instagram Stories. The AI looks at the photo, figures out what it’s about, and then creates a background for your Story.For video creators and viewers, Meta is working on AI that can automatically translate Reels. It will change the speaker's voice to another language and match their lips to the new words. This feature will start with English and Spanish in the US and Latin America, with plans to expand to more languages in the future. Mark Zuckerberg , Meta's CEO, showed off some cool updates for the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses too. These glasses will be able to translate conversations in real-time and understand more natural ways of talking to the AI. Users won't always have to say ""Hey Meta"" to activate the AI, making interactions smoother and more natural. Not just that but they’ll also remember things for you by snapping pictures.Zuckerberg also announced the new AI model, Llama 3.2. It's smarter than ever and can understand both pictures and words.While these changes sound exciting, they also bring up questions about privacy and how AI might change our social media experience. The introduction of AI-generated content in feeds and the use of users' faces in AI-created images raise concerns about consent and data usage. Meta says it's just testing these features for now, and it's not clear how quickly they'll roll out to all users.","Meta's new AI model, Llama 3.2, is smarter than ever and can understand both pictures and words.

Picture abhi baaki hai (The story isn't over yet)

Today, I celebrate 2 years of being in IndiGo (

InterGlobe Aviation

Ltd) and India. On our 18th IndiGo birthday last month, we celebrated many wonderful milestones and unveiled our ambitious plans for coming years. Our story has just started. I am grateful and proud to be a part of this incredible IndiGo journey with my colleagues - giving wings to the nation with over 2,000 daily flights, 430+ domestic and 100+ international routes, and growing every day.

When I had joined, I had shared the quote, ""Wherever you go, becomes a part of you somehow”. Being a part of IndiGo and now living now in India for two years....IndiGo and this beautiful country India have indeed become a part of me. Bharat ab ghar jaisa lagta hai.

India's essence is captured in its beautiful diversity. Of our 88 domestic cities, I had the pleasure of visiting our great teams in 30. From Thiruvananthapuram in the south to Leh in the north. My most recent visit was to Leh, where walking with my son at 18,000 feet at the Khardung La Pass was very special considering my roots are from a country where the highest ""hill"" is some 300 metres only and around 25% of the land is below sea level 😊

Here are some pictures from my travels in the last two years. Can you guess the cities?

Shark Tank judge Anupam Mittal has responded to Indigo CEO Pieter Elbers ’ post celebrating two years of being in India and Indigo. In a LinkedIn post , Elbers wrote “Being a part of IndiGo and now living now in India for two years....IndiGo and this beautiful country India have indeed become a part of me. Bharat ab ghar jaisa lagta hai.” In the post, he also shared photos from his travels to different cities of the country.For those unaware, Pieter Elbers joined Indigo in September 2022.Prior to joining IndiGo, he was the President & Chief Executive Officer of KLM for 8 years. He started his career at KLM in 1992 as Manager Aircraft loading.Mittal replied to the post saying “Aap bhi ab ghar wale jaise lagte ho”. He further added “Good to see u have taken to India”.Take a look at the post here"," Indigo CEO Pieter Elbers celebrated two years of being in India and Indigo.

Artificial intelligence has significantly transformed coding at Google. According to a session at this year’s Google I/O, AI-assisted coding powered by generative AI can enhance developer productivity and accuracy. Speaking on similar lines, a Google executive has stated that while Generative AI is revolutionising how developers write code, it won't completely eliminate the need for coding skills.“I think the landscape is changing significantly.The way developers wrote code before generative AI, how they code now, and how they will in the coming years is likely to change significantly,” Gabe Monroy , vice-president of Developer Experience at Google Cloud told Moneycontrol.Monroy suggested that the growing use of coding assistants like Google's Gemini Code Assist will likely lead to a shift in the makeup of software teams and the specific roles individuals play within those teams.“There will be less need for specialisation, testing, DevOps practices and distinct back-end versus front-end developments. You could have fewer developers who could be more generalist, thanks to artificial intelligence providing the knowledge of adjacent areas in the software process,” he was quoted as saying.Earlier this year, Google CEO Sundar Pichai was asked how he uses Gemini.“We have been having fun with it. I have been brushing up my coding skills,"" Pichai said in an interview with CNBC.Pichai has further encouraged engineers to adapt to the changing landscape of programming with the advancements in AI.""Programming is going to get easier in a way that is better. We are already thankful that we don't have to write in assembly code; we are used to higher-level abstractions. AI will help with even higher-level abstractions,"" he said.“You're going to use natural language and sometimes just say, 'Hey, can you debug this code for me and explain what happened?' and it will do it,” Pichai added.","Artificial intelligence has significantly transformed coding at Google.

“Visa's unlawful conduct affects not just the price of one thing, but the price of nearly everything,""

How Visa defended these allegations



""When businesses and consumers choose Visa, it is because of our secure and reliable network, world-class fraud protection, and the value we provide,""

What US judge said about Google’s monopoly



The US Department of Justice (DoJ) has filed a lawsuit against Visa . According to a report by the news agency Reuters, the US government has accused the largest payment card services company of monopolising debit card swipes. The DoJ had previously accused Google of unlawfully leveraging its search engine monopoly to suppress competition and innovation.DoJ alleged that Visa has suppressed competition by threatening merchants with high fees and even paid off potential rivals for the same.The Justice Department said that Visa processes over 60% of debit transactions nationwide. The prosecutors alleged that the company protects its dominance through agreements with card issuers, merchants and competitors.In a statement to Reuters, Attorney General Merrick Garland noted that merchants and banks pass payment network costs to consumers.Garland added.DoJ prosecutors also alleged that Visa established financially advantageous agreements with potential rivals in the fintech industry, such as Apple, PayPal, and Block Inc's Square. These agreements reportedly ensured that these companies wouldn't launch products that could challenge Visa's dominant market position.Visa's general counsel, Julie Rottenberg said that the debit market is already highly competitive, and therefore the allegations against the company are baseless. She also noted that the company plans to defend themselves strongly against these claims.Rottenberg added.Last month, US district judge Amit Mehta ruled that Google unlawfully leveraged its search engine monopoly to suppress competition and innovation. The verdict highlighted Google's annual expenditure to secure its search engine as the default option on devices as a key factor in maintaining its monopoly. These expenditures, exceeding $26 billion in 2021 alone, were seen as a barrier for competitors to enter the market.","The US Department of Justice (DoJ) has filed a lawsuit against Visa.

The morning routines of some of the world’s most influential tech leaders provide a glimpse into how they prepare for their demanding roles. From intense workouts to catching up on global news, the habits of CEOs like Apple’s Tim Cook, Tesla and SpaceX’s Elon Musk, Google’s Sundar Pichai, Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg, and Microsoft’s Satya Nadella reveal the diverse ways they kick start their days.Elon Musk, the visionary behind Tesla, SpaceX, and Twitter (X), is known for his tireless work ethic.Despite his late-night work hours, Musk typically wakes up around 9:00 AM after six hours of sleep. His first action upon waking is to check his phone for updates and any emergencies related to his businesses. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Musk humorously mentioned, ""Some days I wake up and check Twitter just to see if it’s still working."" His morning routine reflects his hands-on leadership approach, always staying in tune with real-time developments.Google’s CEO Sundar Pichai prefers a more relaxed start to his mornings. Waking up between 6:30 and 7:00 AM, Pichai begins his day with a cup of tea and reads newspapers such as The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times. His breakfast is usually simple—eggs and toast—allowing him to ease into the day calmly. Pichai's reflective start helps him mentally prepare for the many decisions and responsibilities that lie ahead in the day.Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella is a strong advocate of physical fitness to maintain mental sharpness. Rising at 5:30 AM, Nadella prioritises exercise, whether it's running or lifting weights. In a podcast, he shared, ""It's just, 30 minutes of running, and it just makes a huge difference."" This focus on fitness not only keeps him physically fit but also gives him the mental clarity needed for leading a tech giant like Microsoft.Apple’s CEO, Tim Cook, takes early rising to another level, waking up at 3:45 AM each day. His mornings are dedicated to checking and responding to emails, catching up on work before most people have even started their day. Afterward, he heads to the gym at around 5:00 AM for a workout. Cook believes that controlling his morning allows him to manage his time more effectively, as he once stated in an interview with The Australian Financial Review, ""I can control the morning better than the evening.""Meta’s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, begins his day around 8:00 AM by checking Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram—platforms he oversees. In a Facebook Live Q&A, he acknowledged, “It’s a pretty sad situation, to be honest.” Despite the humour, Zuckerberg’s mornings are also filled with physical activity. He enjoys intense workouts that include jiu-jitsu and mixed martial arts, which keep him physically fit and mentally sharp for his role as the head of one of the largest social media companies in the world.","The morning routines of some of the world’s most influential tech leaders provide a glimpse into how they prepare for their demanding roles.

Spotify rolls out AI Playlist feature in more countries: How its works,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/spotify-rolls-out-ai-playlist-feature-in-more-countries-how-its-works/articleshow/113662345.cms,"How to create an AI Playlist on Spotify

From “Your Library”, tap the “+” button at the top-right corner of the app and select “AI Playlist.”

Select one of the suggested prompts or type your own. Remember, get creative and be specific!

Just like that, Spotify will curate a personalised playlist featuring the tracks, artists, and genres we think you’ll like.

From there, you can easily manage the selection of songs by previewing and deleting tracks, or ask Spotify to refine the playlist with additional prompts.

Tap “Create,” and your new playlist will be saved automatically in Your Library.

Spotify has announced that it is rolling out AI Playlist in more countries, including US, Canada, Ireland, and New Zealand. The feature harnesses generative AI and combines it with Spotify’s personalisation technology to make a playlist that is customised for that specific user.“Whether you’re totally new to the game or a prolific playlist creator, this feature offers a fun, easy way to create and curate that perfect musical mix, just for you,” Spotify said.The feature is essentially a tool to help discovery and music curation . The company says that there are over 22 billion new artist discoveries a month on Spotify, with two billion of these turning into more lasting connections between fans and artists.It was first launched in April in beta for Premium subscribers in the UK and Australia and Spotify claims that to date, users have created millions of playlists that they keep coming back to.Creating a playlist with an AI Playlist is as simple as talking to a chatbot. Premium users can enter a text prompt into the chat, like “upbeat pop music for my European summer vacation” or “a romantic playlist for date night at home.”Spotify will then offer a personalised selection of songs that match the vibe. The AI Playlist can also be refined by typing in additional prompts.“The more specific you can be, the better. The most successful playlists are generated with prompts that contain a mix of genres, moods, artists, or decades, so get creative! You can also reference places, animals, activities, movie characters, colours, and even emojis,” Spotify said.If you don't have a prompt in mind, Spotify can help them. Users can head to the Spotify mobile app and select “Your Library” at the bottom-right corner of your screen.Spotify says that since the AI Playlist feature is still in beta, it won’t produce results for non-music-related prompts, like current events or specific brands.","Spotify is rolling out AI Playlist in more countries, including US, Canada, Ireland, and New Zealand.

What is the Martins Beach dispute

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has apologised to Indian-American billionaire Vinod Khosla , days after criticising him for his ‘no plebs allowed’ sign on a beach. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Musk then said “Wow, so crazy that @vkhosla put this sign on a public beach”. He also shared an image with the sign that read “No plebs allowed. Property of Vinod Kholsa”.Replying to Musk, Khosla denied putting up the sign and demanded an apology from him stating “You owe me an apology for spreading falsehoods”.“I think this post of yours needs a community comment for being a fraudulent photo. I have never put up this sign or anything even remotely like this. I presume it is AI generated but you can verify that,” Khosla said.“It will help X if we can have rational debate and not get personal (I can throw personal truths at you unlike your false photo) as we agree on many things (illegal immigration, climate, meritocracy mostly but with caring, ...) and disagree on some big things like who can best save democracy and how important values are in picking a President. By the way EVERY court ruling on ""is there right of public access"" thru the property has supported my claim this is private property with no right of public access thru the property to the public beach. Only court case I have lost is the right to shut the gate for the prior paid parking business that was run by the previous owner with teh state using bureaucracy to not let me apply for a permit to shut it down but requiring a permit. Very California coastal commission.”Now, Musk has offered an apology to Kholsa. In his reply, he said “Sorry I made a sign about you restricting access to a public beach. That was so extremely terrible. Please forgive me 🙏”Vinod Khosla bought a home near Martins Beach in 2008 in a $32.5 million deal. Following this, Khosla reportedly built a gate on the access road to the cove, effectively blocking public entry to the beach. While Khosla's legal team asserts the gate's legitimacy based on his property ownership, this claim faces opposition. The dispute escalated to the U.S. Supreme Court in 2018. Recently, Superior Court Judge Raymond Swope denied Khosla’s bid to throw out a lawsuit against him which says he cannot limit access to Martins Beach which is a popular surfing spot near S.F. Swope.","Tesla CEO Elon Musk has apologised to Indian-American billionaire Vinod Khosla. Musk had criticised him for his ‘no plebs allowed’ sign on a beach.

Mozilla Firefox faces privacy complaint for alleged user tracking,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/mozilla-firefox-faces-privacy-complaint-for-alleged-user-tracking/articleshow/113657349.cms,"What NYOB says in its complaint

What Mozilla says

Mozilla has been accused of tracking user behaviour and websites without consent, reports Reuters. Vienna-based advocacy group NOYB (None Of Your Business) has filed a complaint with the Austrian data protection against the software company. NYOB has accused Mozilla of enabling a “privacy preserving attribution” feature that turned the browser into a tracking tool for websites without directly telling the users.Once a popular choice among users for its privacy features, the open-source Firefox browser now trails behind market leaders like Google’s Chrome, Apple’s Safari, and Microsoft’s Edge.It has a single-digit share of the market.In the complaint, NYOB argued that the feature violates user rights under EU privacy laws , noting that Firefox has enabled the feature by default.“It’s disappointing that an organization like Mozilla assumes users are too uninformed to make a choice,” said Felix Mikolasch, data protection lawyer at NOYB. “Users should be given the option, and the feature should have been disabled by default,” he added.NOYB says that it wants Mozilla to inform users about its data processing activities, switch to an opt-in system and delete all unlawfully processed data of millions of affected users.Mozilla on its part defends the “privacy preserving attribution” feature stating that it helps websites understand how their ads perform without collecting data about users. It says that the feature is a non-invasive alternative to cross-site tracking and is aimed to significantly reduce collecting individual information.",Vienna-based advocacy group NOYB (None Of Your Business) has filed a complaint with the Austrian data protection against the software company.

Former Amazon engineer’s post on ‘wild tricks’ Amazon employees used to not work from office goes viral: Read what it says,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/former-amazon-engineers-post-on-wild-tricks-amazon-employees-used-to-not-work-from-office-goes-viral-read-what-it-says/articleshow/113653947.cms,"The three ‘wild tricks’ of Amazon employees

A former Amazon Web Services ( AWS ) engineer has exposed creative methods employees allegedly used to circumvent the company's return-to-office mandate , sparking widespread attention online.John McBride , who worked at AWS until June 2023, shared a viral post on X (formerly Twitter) detailing three ""wild"" tactics he claims engineers employed to avoid physically returning to the office.The post has garnered over a million views since being shared.""When I worked at AWS, engineers went to wild lengths to avoid returning to the office,"" McBride wrote, describing the methods as ""true ingenuity and innovation"" - though not focused on customer-oriented objectives.The most common trick, according to McBride, involved employees briefly entering the office during lunch hours. Workers would badge in, grab free refreshments, and immediately leave. This approach reportedly succeeded for several weeks until Amazon began tracking actual time spent in the office.A more sophisticated method entailed renaming home Wi-Fi networks to match office network names. This fooled reporting software into marking employees as present in the office when logging in remotely. McBride noted this tactic worked temporarily until IT teams enhanced their tracking capabilities.The riskiest strategy involved covert arrangements where employees left their badges at the office for colleagues to scan in and out on their behalf. Despite the potential consequences, McBride claimed to know someone who maintained this deception for months.McBride's revelations come amid ongoing debates about remote work policies in the tech industry . Amazon recently announced plans to require employees to work from the office five days a week starting January 2, 2025, ending its previous hybrid work model.The former engineer's post has reignited discussions about the necessity of in-office presence for tech workers, especially given advancements in remote collaboration tools. It also highlights the lengths some employees may go to preserve work flexibility gained during the pandemic.McBride describes these tactics as part of a larger "" silent sacking "" strategy, which he claims is a five-phase plan by Amazon to reduce its workforce. This includes making work life unsatisfying for remote employees by excluding them from meetings and meaningful work.","A former Amazon Web Services ( AWS ) engineer has exposed creative methods employees allegedly used to circumvent the company's return-to-office mandate.

How the scam happened

What the police said

A series of email and WhatsApp scams targeting women in Spain have resulted in losses of over Rs 3 crore. The scammers, posing as Hollywood actor Brad Pitt, have managed to deceive numerous victims into sending them substantial sums of money.A woman from Andalusia in southern Spain was defrauded of 175,000 euros (approximately Rs 2 crore), while another woman from the northern Basque Country lost 150,000 euros (over Rs 1 crore).The scammers employed a variety of tactics to gain the trust of their victims. They contacted the women through a Brad Pitt fan page, promising romantic relationships and enticing them to invest in several nonexistent projects. They targeted these women by monitoring their social media activity.As reported by the Guardian, Spain's Guardia Civil police, said, “The cybercriminals , to capture the victims, had studied their social networks and made a psychological profile of them, thus discovering that both women were two vulnerable people, lacking in affection and in a state of depression.”“They also used instant messaging platforms to exchange messages and emails with the two women until they reached a point where they believed they were chatting via WhatsApp with Brad Pitt himself, who promised them a romantic relationship and a future together,” added the police.The police arrested five individuals from Andalusia and conducted raids on at least five homes related to the case. They seized several mobile phones, two computers, bank cards, and a diary containing phrases used to deceive the victims. Additionally, the police recovered 85,000 euros (approximately Rs 80,000).","A series of email and WhatsApp scams targeting women in Spain have resulted in losses of over Rs 3 crore.

Driver stole Rs 63 lakh from senior citizen's bank account: Why consumer commission asked SBI to pay Rs 97 lakh as compensation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/driver-stole-rs-63-lakh-from-senior-citizens-bank-account-why-consumer-commission-asked-sbi-to-pay-rs-97-lakh-as-compensation/articleshow/113652358.cms,"What SBI said on the fraud

Lessons to be learnt

Customers:

A retired couple in Hyderabad reportedly fell victim to a shocking bank fraud, losing their entire life savings held in State Bank of India (SBI). According to a report in ET Wealth, their driver, taking advantage of their trust, managed to steal over Rs 60 lakh from their savings account and fixed deposits (FDs).The couple, unfamiliar with smartphones, opted for ""view-only"" access for their SBI internet banking .This limited access only allowed them to see account details, not conduct transactions. However, their driver somehow managed to switch their account to ""transaction facility"" without their knowledge. He then used their phone and the SBI YONO app to prematurely break their FDs and transfer the money to his own account before disappearing.Devastated by the loss, the couple reported the theft to SBI and filed a police complaint. Dissatisfied with the response, they took their case to the consumer commissions. After years of legal battle, both the Telangana State Consumer Commission and the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) ruled in their favor.Lawyers representing SBI reportedly said that 37 transactions worth Rs 63,74,536 occurred in the elderly couple's bank account, which the couple says is' unauthorised'. The bank's lawyers said that the 'transaction rights' were enabled by logging into https://www.onlinesbi.com on August 5, 2018, at 11:20 AM. ""The bank sent an OTP to the registered mobile number to complete this request on the same day. Thus, the claim that she did not have transaction rights did not hold……All transactions were initiated and completed upon proper validation of customer credentials. Further, each fund transfer was authenticated via an OTP sent to the registered mobile number of the customer. Notifications of deposits/ credits in the savings account were also sent via SMS, indicating that the respondents were aware of the transactions,"" said the bank's lawyers.Lawyers representing SBI said, ""It is the customer's obligation to prevent unauthorised use of their mobile device and to avoid sharing the mobile banking password/PIN with unauthorised persons. They shared their mobile, PIN number and other details with their associates, and that all disputed transactions were conducted by these associates either in connivance with them or due to their negligence.""Both Telangana State Consumer Commission and NCDRC held SBI liable for allowing the 'unauthorised transactions'.The commissions held SBI responsible for allowing the unauthorized switch from ""view-only"" to ""transaction facility."" SBI argued that the couple received OTPs for the transactions, indicating their involvement. However, the commissions found this unconvincing, highlighting the couple's age and lack of technical knowledge. They concluded that the stolen phone and deleted transaction alerts made it easy for the driver to hide his actions.""Internet banking facility is provided as an additional facility to facilitate efficiency. Notwithstanding the same, unfortunately this Internet Banking platform adversely impacted the elderly couple in the present case who are the valued customers of the OP Bank (SBI) wherein, their driver, by being familiar with Account No. details and merely accessing the mobile phone easily misappropriated such high value funds. This happened even when the Complainants had sought ""view only"" and internet banking facility was not requested. Change to Internet banking facility was also obtained by the fraudster over the phone itself and perpetrated the offences,"" said NCDRC in its order.The NCDRC emphasized the importance of protecting vulnerable customers like the elderly who rely on banks for safekeeping their hard-earned money. SBI was ordered to reimburse the stolen amount (Rs 63,74,527) with interest, along with compensation and legal costs, totaling over Rs 97 lakh.This case serves as a stark reminder for both banks and customers:Stricter verification procedures are needed to prevent unauthorized changes to account access.Be cautious about sharing banking details and phone access with anyone, even trusted individuals. Consider alternative security measures for online banking, especially if unfamiliar with smartphones.",Retired couple in Hyderabad fell victim to a shocking bank fraud.
