“We got it wrong”: Google CEO Sundar Pichai on Gemini AI chatbot’s inaccurate image generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/we-got-it-wrong-google-ceo-sundar-pichai-on-gemini-ai-chatbots-inaccurate-image-generation/articleshow/109958685.cms,"What Pichai previously said on biassed image generation

Google CEO Sundar Pichai has said that the company got it wrong when it generated racially biassed image results in response to user queries earlier this year. He also said that the image generation capabilities in Google Gemini will be re-released in a few weeks.“We got it wrong,” Pichai said in an interview with Bloomberg, indicating that the incident was an example where good intentions backfired.Google quickly paused Gemini's image-generating feature after social media users complained it was creating ‘wrong’ images. In the image that caused much uproar, the chatbot included people of colour while depicting Nazis and the US Founding Fathers.Pichai, who dubbed AI tool 's controversial responses 'completely unacceptable', also ordered a complete rebuild.“From the ground up we are retraining these models, just to make sure we are also making the product better. As soon as it’s ready, we will get it out to people,” he said.Previously, Pichai said that Gemini’s answers align with the answers that users find on Google Search .“The work we have done over many many years is making sure, from a Search standpoint, we try to reflect what's out on the web and we want to give trustworthy, high-quality information,” Pichai said.“What I'm saying it's not about [just] giving an answer. There are certain times you give an answer [for questions like] ‘What's the population of the United States?’ Yes, it's an answerable question. [But] there are times you want to surface a breadth of opinions out there on the web, which is what search does and does it well,” the top executive added.“Just because you're saying we are summarising it on top doesn't mean we are from those principles, the summary can still point you to the range of opinions out there,” Pichai explained.The company previously acknowledged the issue, saying that this happened due to “limitations in the training data used to develop Gemini.” Even Google co-founder Sergey Brin also said at San Francisco's AGI House that the AI chatbot “definitely messed up”.",Google CEO Sundar Pichai has said that the company got it wrong when it generated racially biassed image results in response to user queries.

Not playing “someone else’s dance music”: Google CEO Sundar Pichai’s reply to Microsoft’s Satya Nadella,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/not-playing-someone-elses-dance-music-google-ceo-sundar-pichais-reply-to-microsofts-satya-nadella/articleshow/109958652.cms,"What Satya Nadella said

‘Microsoft invested AI due to Google’s lead’

Google CEO Sundar Pichai may have finally answered the billion dollar question – whether the company “danced” after Microsoft took a lead in launching AI-powered innovation in the form of ‘new’ Bing ? He said that he is focused and not “play to someone else’s dance music.”“I think one of the ways you can do the wrong thing is by listening to the noise out there and playing someone else’s dance music,” Pichai said in an interview with Bloomberg.“I've always been very clear. I think we have a clear sense of what we need to do,” he added. When asked, “So you are listening to your own music?” Pichai said, “That’s exactly right”Earlier this year, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella was talking about Google’s edge on his company in terms of search. However, after launching an AI-boosted Bing search engine, he said that AI might present a new battleground for the companies.“We competed today. Today was a day where we brought some more competition to search. Believe me, I’ve been at it for 20 years, and I’ve been waiting for it,” Nadella said, adding that Google still is the “800-pound gorilla” when it comes to search business.“At the end of the day, they’re the 800-pound gorilla in this. That is what they are. And I hope that, with our innovation, they will definitely want to come out and show that they can dance. And I want people to know that we made them dance, and I think that’ll be a great day,” he said.Recently, a report by the publication claimed that Microsoft invested in OpenAI after learning about the lead that Google has in terms of AI infrastructure and wanted to catch up.Responding to a question on how he sees the situation, Pichai said that there’s always a lot of competition when it comes to technology.“We see it all the time. The way you stay ahead is by innovating relentlessly. It has to be true all the time. It’s happening at a faster pace. Technology changes tend to get faster over time. So its not surprising to me at all,” Pichai noted.",Google CEO Sundar Pichai said that he is focused and not ‘play to someone else’s dance music’ Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said earlier this year that Google was the ‘800-pound gorilla’ when it comes to search.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109958650,imgsize-18252,width-400,resizemode-4/109958650.jpg"

Tata Electronics’ chips will be used in multiple products



Tata Electronics has reportedly started exporting limited quantities of semiconductor chip samples – a move that is expected to boost India’s chip-making sector.Citing people familiar with the matter, a report by The Economic Times said that the indigenous chip sample was packaged at a pilot line at the company’s Bengaluru-based research and development centre.The report said that Tata Electronics is shipping these packaged chips to some of its partners in Japan, the US and Europe. Currently, the company is also laying the groundwork for its new chip packaging unit at Morigaon in Assam and a $10 billion chip foundry at Dholera, Gujarat.“Tata Electronics has packaged chips there which they are sending to customers right now outside the country. They have multiple partners and are expanding their customer base. Some of these (products) are still in the pilot stage,” one of the sources told ET.As per the report, another source claimed that the company is nearing completion of the design phase for semiconductor chips in 28, 40, 55, and 65 nanometers, along with other higher nodes.Tape-out signifies the conclusion of the design process for integrated circuits or printed circuit boards before they are manufactured.“There are multiple rounds before a successful tape-out. So, some of these products will be in advanced stages of R&D and they will be sent to select customers to obtain feedback for testing and improvement. Commercial production is slated for 2027,” the source noted.The source also mentioned the chips that are currently being exported by Tata Electronics could be utilised in various products once packaged. The chips manufactured by the company have not been designed for a specific purpose and can be used for different sectors,“When you package the chips, it really does not matter what the chips are used for. It is just a matter of when you package them and prepare them to be used. Tata Electronics has products in multiple areas,” the source added.In April, Tata Electronics also signed a strategic deal with Tesla to supply semiconductor chips for its global operations.","Tata Electronics has reportedly started exporting limited quantities of semiconductor chip samples.

The company is expected to announce two new iPad Pro modes – 12.9-inch and 11-inch and is set to bring several small and big changes to Apple’s most premium iPads.First and foremost, Apple iPad Pro models are expected to come with OLED displays for the first time ditching the mini-LED in the 12.9 model and LCD panel in the 11-inch. With the OLED panels, the iPad display quality is set to go up in terms of contrast, colour production, colour accuracy, black levels and more and this will come in handy for people who use it for creating illustrations, art, editing photos and videos, etc.Apart from this, both the models are set to go slimmer by almost 20% compared to the outgoing models. Also, the iPads are expected to be about 15% smaller overall.New iPad Pro models are also expected to be powered by Apple’s new M4 chip . And, if this happens, these iPads will become the first models to debut with Apple’s latest silicon.Another major change that we may get to see is in terms of front-facing camera placement. Reports suggest that Apple will place the front-facing camera in landscape mode this time around.Apple is expected to introduce a bigger iPad Air featuring a 12.9-inch display, similar to the iPad Pro model.

With today’s launch, iPad Air buyers will have two options to choose from.As per some reports, the 12.9-inch iPad Air will feature the same mini-LED panel as the outgoing iPad Pro 12.9-inch. While some reports also suggest that Apple could use the LCD display with it.In terms of performance, the iPad Air is expected to be powered by an M2 chip which should bring a notable speed upgrade. Also, some new colour options are also set to make the cut.Magic Keyboard has been long due for an upgrade and this year, it is finally happening. Now, the outgoing model isn't bad, it balances out functionality and forms pretty well. However, the upcoming model is set to bring some design changes like an aluminium base and a bigger trackpad.Also, rumours suggest that the upcoming Magic Keyboard will be exclusive to the iPad Pro models.New Apple Pencil pr Pencils are coming. Tim Cook has already dropped the hit via its official X handle. It is expected that Apple will launch Apple Pencil 3 at the event. The headline feature is expected to be magnetically swappable tips.

A captivating romance can uplift anyone's spirits, and anime has a unique ability to vividly portray these narratives. Over the years, Japanese animation has delivered numerous romantic tales, ranging from light-hearted comedies to deeply emotional dramas.For romance enthusiasts, going through so many anime options can be overwhelming. However, there are several exceptional romance anime series that truly shine above the rest.Here is a curated list of top romance anime series , compiled by Game Rant, along with their respective rankings.Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie stirred mixed reactions upon its debut in Spring 2022, often compared to ""My Dress-Up Darling"" but standing out as a unique slice-of-life anime centred around a charming couple, Shikimori and Yuu Izumi.One distinctive aspect of the series is its portrayal of the main couple already in a relationship, a rarity in anime. While the episodes focus on everyday moments, they paint a wholesome picture of young love with two endearing characters navigating the nuances of romance.Describing Bakemonogatari as a straightforward romance might be a stretch, but this instalment of Monogatari indeed focuses on and highlights the relationship between Koyomi Araragi and Hitagi Senjougahara. Their initial interactions are unconventional, involving a stapler to the face, but Araragi's determination to assist Senjougahara with her curse ultimately brings them closer.Despite the surreal and eccentric nature of Monogatari, the romance between Araragi and Senjougahara is remarkably grounded and healthy. While the series introduces other potential romantic interests, their relationship remains steadfast and central to the narrative.""Sing 'Yesterday' for Me"" presents romance in a refreshingly realistic manner compared to many other anime. The series takes a classic love triangle and steers it in an unexpected direction by the end, resulting in a highly satisfying conclusion that portrays how failed romances can evolve into strong friendships.Directed by Yoshiyuki Fujiwara, known for his work on popular anime like ""Attack on Titan"" and ""Sword Art Online,"" the shift to a show with such a different tone demonstrates his versatility and mastery in storytelling across diverse genres.""My Happy Marriage"" emerged as one of the standout romance anime of Summer 2023, adapted from Akumi Agitogi's novel series. Set in an alternate Meiji Restoration era with supernatural elements, the story follows Miyo, who endures mistreatment from her stepfamily despite her privileged background. Her family arranges her marriage to a notorious military figure known for rejecting wives quickly, with rejection spelling disaster for Miyo. However, Kiyoka surprises everyone by taking an interest in Miyo and becoming incensed by her family's cruelty.The anime delves into the lasting impact of Miyo's abuse, highlighting her struggle to regain self-worth, even with Kiyoka's support. Kiyoka himself is a complex character with hidden motives behind his initial attraction to Miyo, although his feelings for her are genuine.While the romance between Miyo and Kiyoka is heartwarming, ""My Happy Marriage"" falls short in other areas. The supernatural elements can seem disjointed, and the villains are one-dimensional despite being detestable.Based on Fumita Yanagida's popular and finished manga, ""Tomo-chan Is a Girl!"" stood out as one of Winter 2023's most amusing romantic comedies. Tomo and Jun share a close friendship, but Jun sees Tomo strictly as a friend, unaware of her romantic feelings.While romance is central to its characters, ""Tomo-chan Is a Girl!"" leans heavily into comedy. Tomo and Jun's dynamic is charming, and they're supported by entertaining characters like Misuzu and Carol. Despite its comedic tone, the chemistry between Tomo and Jun develops convincingly over the season. Unlike some romance anime, Tomo-chan excels in portraying why its leads are compatible without difficulty.Teen romance anime often dominate the genre, but there are exceptions worth noting. ""Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku"" is primarily a workplace comedy that revolves around two couples: the newly formed pair of Hirotaka Nifuji and Narumi Momose, and the more established couple, Tarou Kabakura and Hanako Koyanagi. The focus remains on Hirotaka and Narumi, with the series emphasising humour over romance, but Tarou and Hanako's relationship is depicted realistically.Despite being childhood friends, Narumi struggles to see Hirotaka as a potential romantic interest, a dynamic that persists throughout the series. The anime's brevity limits the depth of these relationships, but ""Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku"" provides an entertaining journey within its runtime.""Romantic Killer"" cleverly parodies romance and harem anime while paying homage to their core strengths. Anzu, a girl with no interest in boys, is suddenly thrust into a reverse harem scenario by a magical being, disrupting her life of gaming and chocolate consumption. Unamused by her newfound romantic entanglements with unfamiliar guys, Anzu navigates this unconventional situation with scepticism.Primarily a comedy, ""Romantic Killer"" aims to elicit laughter from its audience, often succeeding with its humour rooted in its origins as a shonen manga, characterised by exaggerated facial expressions.Though not always aiming for emotional depth, the anime treats its characters and their relationships seriously. Anzu shines as a compelling lead, and the male characters introduced as potential partners are well-developed. ""Romantic Killer"" offers a delightful blend of humour and romance for those seeking an entertaining and unconventional love story.""The Angel Next Door Spoils Me Rotten"" captivates viewers from the start for several reasons. Firstly, Project No.9's animation is impressive, featuring clean and detailed character designs. Secondly, and most importantly, the main characters exhibit instant chemistry, evident when Amane offers his umbrella to a soaked Mahiru, sparking a connection.Throughout the series, despite the frequent presence of both leads on screen, ""The Angel Next Door Spoils Me Rotten"" effectively delves into their individual personalities while also developing their friendship.Rumiko Takahashi is celebrated as a legendary mangaka, known for classics like Inuyasha, Ranma 1/2, and Urusei Yatsura. While most of her renowned works fall within the shonen genre, Takahashi has also ventured into seinen storytelling. Maison Ikkoku stands out as one of her most mature works, emphasising romance as its primary theme.Unlike Takahashi's prominent shonen series that explore various genres such as comedy and action alongside romance, Maison Ikkoku focuses squarely on romantic elements, enriched with drama, character development, and humour.The central relationship features Kyouko and Yuusaku, both drawn to each other but hindered by their circumstances. Kyouko, grieving the recent loss of her husband, is hesitant to move forward. Meanwhile, Yuusaku, deeply in love with Kyouko, doubts his worthiness as a student. The anime chronicles their journeys of growth, healing, and mutual misunderstanding, complemented by well-developed secondary characters.Insomniacs After School emerged as the standout romance of Spring 2023, adapted from Makoto Ojiro's esteemed seinen manga. The story revolves around two students plagued by insomnia, a burden they carried alone until they met at their school's observatory. Isaki and Ganta form an immediate bond, which deepens as they work together to revive the Astronomy Club, driven by their shared need to preserve their newfound sanctuary.The anime boasts impeccable pacing, skillfully depicting the protagonists' isolation due to insomnia and the subtle solace they find in each other. While romance is a central theme, the series prioritises developing Ganta and Isaki's friendship before advancing their relationship, emphasising the depth of their connection beyond shared circumstances.Kokoro Connect injects a supernatural twist into a classic love triangle scenario. The story centers around Taichi, Iori, Yui, Yoshifumi, and Himeko, students of the Student Cultural Research Club, whose lives take a turn when they receive supernatural abilities from a mysterious being named Heartseed.As they grapple with these newfound powers, the group experiences sensory phenomena that challenge their relationships and reveal hidden aspects of their personalities. The anime is rich in character development, providing an engaging and thought-provoking experience.Maid Sama! carries many tropes that might derail other romance anime: an overly perfect male lead, a strong female protagonist reduced to a damsel, and an unnecessary love triangle. Despite these shortcomings, Maid Sama! shines through its strong personality.The heart of Maid Sama! lies in the relationship between Takumi Usui, a charming heartthrob, and Misaki Ayuzawa, a strict student council president with a busy schedule balancing school, home, and work. When Takumi discovers Misaki's secret job at a maid cafe, it opens a new perspective on the usually composed president.In ""Rascal Does Not Dream Of Bunny Girl Senpai,"" romance plays a subtle yet compelling role that defines the series. The story centers on Sakuta Azusagawa, a high school student drawn to girls suffering from Adolescence Syndrome, a condition linked to their insecurities.While the anime unfolds through different arcs focusing on various girls, the standout is the initial saga featuring Mai Sakurajima, an actress who forms a close bond with Sakuta. Their dynamic crackles with romantic tension, warmth, and clever banter. Although not always in the foreground, their relationship develops steadily across subsequent arcs, leading to a satisfying sequel in the form of a feature film.Wakana Gojou and Marin Kitagawa inhabit completely contrasting worlds. Gojou, isolated and reserved, keeps himself apart from others due to his passion for hina dolls, fearing ridicule. In contrast, Kitagawa is popular, outgoing, and self-assured.Despite their differences, Kitagawa becomes intrigued by cosplay and sees Gojou as the ideal person to create outfits for her. ""My Dress-Up Darling"" is a charming, humorous, and beautifully animated romance anime that excels in executing classic genre tropes with finesse.""Toradora!"" is a beloved slice-of-life romantic comedy that offers a wonderful entry point into the genre. The story revolves around Ryuji Yusaku and Taiga Aisaka, two students who have crushes on each other's best friends.Both Ryuji and Taiga are viewed as outcasts—Ryuji due to his intimidating appearance and Taiga because of her fiery temper. They team up to assist each other in their romantic pursuits. The series delves into their evolving dynamic and the humorous mishaps that ensue as they navigate their intertwined love lives.""The Pet Girl of Sakurasou"" depicts the journey of an eccentric group of characters as they navigate growth and self-discovery. Sorata Kanda is forced to move into the unconventional Sakura House after being kicked out of his school's main dorms.In Sakura House, Sorata encounters talented yet troubled students. When a peculiar young artist joins the dorm, Sorata takes on the responsibility of helping her adjust to her new life. The series delves into the interactions among the dorm mates, their personal aspirations, and the interconnected nature of their relationships.""Ouran High School Host Club"" is a delightful reverse harem anime filled with lighthearted and meaningful moments. Haruhi Fujioka accidentally breaks an antique vase belonging to her school's Host Club and must repay her debt by disguising herself as a boy and working as a host.The series excels in developing Haruhi's character along with her fellow hosts, providing insight into their motivations and personalities. It's a must-watch for shojo fans, featuring a memorable cast of characters that carries the show through its run.Kyoto Animation has produced many beloved anime, and ""Love, Chunibyo & Other Delusions!"" is among them. The series centers around a phenomenon known as Chunibyo, where adolescents have grandiose and unrealistic delusions.Yuta Togashi, who has outgrown his delusional phase, aims for a normal high school life. However, things take a turn when his classmate, Rikka Takanashi, reminds him of his past and tries to pull him back into the world of Chunibyo with her own delusions. The series delves into their relationship as Yuta unravels the triggers behind Rikka's delusions.The trope of opposites attracting may be overused, but when done well, it can lead to a captivating romantic comedy. ""Kimi ni Todoke"" explores the endearing friendship between the shy Sawako Kuronuma and the popular Shouta Kazehaya. Sawako, often mistaken for Sadako from ""The Ring,"" is isolated at school due to her appearance, making it challenging for her to break out of her shell. Fortunately, Kazehaya is just the right person to help her.""Kimi ni Todoke"" is a delightful and heartwarming anime with well-developed characters who evolve as the story unfolds. While it adheres to typical romance anime pacing, the journey remains engaging and enjoyable.Unlike most romance stories that focus on the process of falling in love, ""Tonikawa: Over The Moon For You"" follows a married couple who have already reached that point. As a result, the anime adopts a slice-of-life approach, showcasing Nasa and Tsukasa's daily life and antics rather than a typical romantic journey. ""Tonikawa"" doesn't rely on dramatic highs but instead offers a pleasant and light-hearted experience.While this anime may not appeal to everyone, it serves as a refreshing departure from more melodramatic romance shows. Despite their tendency to blush at the slightest physical contact, Nasa and Tsukasa are refreshingly direct in expressing their feelings, making them both witty and likeable characters.This romantic anime shines because of its main character, Takeo Gouda. His towering, imposing presence contrasts beautifully with his heartfelt affection for the delicate Rinko, which is truly heartwarming. Takeo's efforts to play matchmaker for Rinko with his best friend, despite his own feelings, demonstrate his genuine kindness.Viewers will undoubtedly root for Takeo and Rinko's endearing relationship. ""My Love Story!!"" delivers the goods without delay, as the main characters are dating for most of the episodes, bypassing the typical slow build-up to a confession.""A Sign of Affection"" is a heartwarming romantic comedy centred on college-age love and the challenges of communication. While not the sole focus of the story, Yuki and Itsuomi stand out as the main couple, instantly captivating viewers. Yuki, who is hearing-impaired, communicates using sign language, text, and by reading lips, while Itsuomi is a world traveller passionate about learning languages. Their connection begins on a train and grows stronger with each subsequent encounter.The anime beautifully captures the intense emotions of falling in love, highlighted by a poignant moment in the opening episode. With an older cast, ""A Sign of Affection"" takes on a more mature tone compared to typical romance anime. Throughout the season, Yuki and Itsuomi become increasingly comfortable around each other, resulting in consistently endearing interactions.This romantic anime is ideal for LGBTQ+ viewers seeking representation on screen, but its well-crafted storytelling makes it enjoyable for all audiences. The heartwarming romance blossoms between Mafuyu and Ritsuka as Mafuyu learns to play guitar and sing in Ritsuka's band.Watching Mafuyu's growing confidence alongside the romantic tension creates a compelling series that's hard to resist. The accompanying movie is also outstanding and a must-watch continuation of the series.Nana is one of the most renowned and beloved shoujo anime of all time, a must-watch for fans of romance and beyond. The series follows two women named Nana, seemingly different but navigating curiously similar life situations that lead to separate outcomes.Without giving away how their stories intertwine, Nana's 47 episodes delve into the protagonists' perspectives on love through various relationships. Grounded in reality, the anime explores complex characters who, despite occasional extremes, face accountability for their actions.Your Lie in April, one of the most famous romance anime, revolves around two music prodigies: Kousei Arima and Kaori Miyazono. Kousei, grappling with depression after his mother's death, loses his passion for the piano and withdraws from the performance arts. One day, he hears Kaori playing her violin with such freedom that it reignites his love for music and sparks his admiration for her.The anime delves into themes of grief, life, love, and music. Kousei's journey toward self-healing is profound, marked by heartbreak, but also punctuated by moments of beauty, tenderness, and joy.In this anime, Miyuki and Kaguya engage in a battle of wits to avoid confessing their love first, using their intellect and skills to outmaneuver each other. Both are determined not to be seen as the one who gives in.Their antics running the student council at an elite school with their friends are uproariously funny yet also contain heartwarming moments that will make viewers cheer. Season 3 of Kaguya-sama: Love is War, which aired in Spring 2022, leaned heavily into comedy but also devoted more time to developing Miyuki and Kaguya's relationship and touching on other romances.If the anime follows the manga, the next season of Love is War promises to be predominantly romantic. If successful, this upcoming release could elevate Kaguya-sama to the pinnacle of romance anime.This anime consists of two parts: Clannad and After Story. The latter surpasses the former by a wide margin, but watching Clannad is essential to fully appreciate the impact of After Story. While it features a diverse cast of supporting characters, the heart of the show revolves around Tomoya Okazaki and Nagisa Furukawa, delivering a profound narrative.Unlike typical romance series, Clannad After Story unfolds beyond high school, depicting the growth of Tomoya and Nagisa as individuals and as a couple. The anime tackles real-life challenges without glossing over them, offering a genuine exploration of common struggles.The Dangers in My Heart is truly brilliant. At first glance, it may seem like another typical shounen romance where a popular girl falls for an ordinary loner guy. These stories often offer little beyond wish fulfilment, and The Dangers in My Heart initially appears to fit that mould. Yet, the anime stands out.Ichikawa is an average guy with few friends who daydreams about unusual things. While the anime doesn't delve deeply into these thoughts, it doesn't ignore them either, leaving Ichikawa with a poor first impression. On the other hand, Anna is a cheerful but shy girl who loves food and works as a model. After a chance encounter at the school library, the two start spending time together, developing a friendship that hints at something deeper. Anna encourages Ichikawa to break out of his shell, leading to significant changes in him over the course of two seasons.Although slow-paced initially, The Dangers in My Heart evolves into something special by the end of season 1, maintaining its momentum in the subsequent cour and establishing itself as one of the best romance anime of all time. Anna and Ichikawa are both exceptional characters, but Anna's depth is what elevates the show. She's not just an idealised plot device; she's a fully realised character with insecurities, quirks, and vulnerabilities. Her interest in Ichikawa feels genuine, and vice versa. This is a rare quality in romance anime.Fruits Basket is the definitive romance anime, masterfully blending drama and comedy. Tooru Honda, a lovable protagonist, faces life's challenges until she moves in with the Souma family. The Soumas, particularly Yuki, are school idols hiding a shocking secret that alters perceptions.Love triangles often lack depth, favouring one partner over the other. Fruits Basket defies this norm with its compelling love triangle, where each character is fully developed. Across three seasons, Fruits Basket takes viewers on an unforgettable journey.Also read | 15 best anime series of all time; here's the list","Japanese animation has delivered numerous romantic tales, ranging from light- hearted comedies to deeply emotional dramas.
