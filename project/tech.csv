CEO of Europe's second most-valuable technology company has ‘warned’ EU on AI regulation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ceo-of-europes-second-most-valuable-technology-company-has-warned-eu-on-ai-regulation/articleshow/114472768.cms,"Meta, Spotify Ericsson and others’ Meta warning shot over EU AI regulation

Another top tech company executive has warned the European regulators over the regulation of AI technology, saying that with the regulation, the block risks falling behind the US and China in the AI sector. Christian Klein , the CEO of German tech giant SAP , advised that Europe should focus its attention on the results of AI technology.Talking to CNBC, Klein said while it is important to curb the risks associated with AI, regulating the technology while it’s still in its infancy would be misguided.“It’s very important that how we train our algorithms, the AI use cases we embed into the businesses of our customers — they need to deliver the right outcome for the employees, for the society,” Klein was quoted as saying.“If you only regulate technology in Europe, how can our startups here in Europe, how can they compete against the other startups in China, in Asia, in the US?” Klein added.“Especially for the startup scene here in Europe, it’s very important to think about the outcome of the technology but not to regulate the AI technology itself.”SAP recently surged to become Europe's most valuable tech company, surpassing ASML Holding NV. At the time of writing, ASML has surged past SAP. SAP’s rise is fueled by soaring demand for SAP's cloud-based solutions and AI applications. The company recently announced a restructuring plan to further integrate AI into its software offerings.The comments from SAP CEO came after Ericsson CEO Borje Ekholm joined forces with over 40 prominent tech executives and researchers, including Mark Zuckerberg of Meta and Daniel Ek of Spotify, to express serious concerns about the European Union 's approach to AI regulation .In an open letter, they argue that the EU's fragmented and inconsistent rules are hindering innovation and economic growth within the bloc. The letter stated that Europe “has become less competitive and less innovative compared to other regions” due to “inconsistent regulatory decision making”.“This means the next generation of open source AI models, and products, services we build on them, won’t understand or reflect European knowledge, culture or languages,” the letter read.","Christian Klein, the CEO of German tech giant SAP, advised that Europe should focus its attention on the results of AI technology.

Two likely reasons why Zepto plans to shift 'holding company' to India from Singapore,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/two-likely-reasons-why-zepto-plans-to-shift-holding-company-to-india-from-singapore/articleshow/114477479.cms,"Rapido declined to comment on its proposed partnership with Zepto.

There are said to be two core reasons behind this round:

* First:

* Second:

Quick commerce company Zepto is reportedly looking to shore up its domestic shareholding with “well-known and credible” names. According to a report in Economic Times, family offices of Manipal group chief Ranjan Pai, Mankind Pharma brothers Ramesh Juneja and Rajeev Juneja, and Cipla are likely to join Zepto’s funding round.Zepto has raised over $1 billion in the four months.It is valued at $5 billion following its $340 million fundraise on August 29. Presently, most of the shareholders in Zepto are foreign investors.Zepto’s parent Kiranakart has also reportedly filed an application with the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) to move its holding company to India from Singapore . The move is said to be part of a plan to become an Indian majority-owned company over the next 12-18 months. Zepto is reportedly working with Deloitte on the migration.These family offices and HNIs will bring more confidence to mutual fund investors for the pre-IPO funding as well as improve government confidence in the operating structure.A large Indian shareholding is said to be certainly more favourable in key government circles and among policymakers. India’s foreign direct investment (FDI) rules don’t allow foreign-funded online marketplaces to own inventory or control sellers on their platforms.A Y Combinator alumnus, Zepto is reportedly moving its domicile to India linked to its IPO plans besides the fact that a fully domiciled local company may also gain on their optics in terms of job creation and fuelling e-commerce growth here.","Zepto is reportedly looking to shore up its domestic shareholding with ‘well- known and credible’ names.

Government launches system to block ‘fake’ international scam calls: How will it make citizens safe,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/government-launches-system-to-block-fake-international-scam-calls-how-will-it-make-citizens-safe/articleshow/114471409.cms,"How this system will protect citizens from scam calls

The government on Tuesday (October 22) launched a spam-tracking system that can identify and block incoming international calls posing as Indian phone numbers – a tactic often used by scammers for financial fraud in India. The system, called ‘International Incoming Spoofed Calls Prevention System’, was launched by telecom minister Jyotiraditya Scindia.“This is another milestone of DoT’s efforts towards building a safe digital space and protecting citizens from cyber-crime ,” the government said.Cybercriminals have devised a new method to deceive and defraud individuals: international calls disguised as local Indian numbers (+91-xxxxxxxxx). By manipulating the calling line identity (CLI), which is essentially the displayed phone number, these calls appear to originate within India, even though they are actually made from abroad.This tactic allows fraudsters to bypass suspicion and gain the trust of unsuspecting victims. These spoofed calls are then used for various malicious purposes, including:Financial scams by tricking people into revealing sensitive financial information or making fraudulent payments; impersonation wherein they pose as government officials, law enforcement officers, or even family members to extract money or personal data.Scammers even threaten victims with false accusations, such as involvement in illegal activities or impending arrest, to extort money or coerce them into compromising situations.“These spoofed calls have been used for financial scams, impersonating government officials, and creating panic. There have also been cases of cyber-crime threatening disconnection of mobile numbers by DoT/TRAI officials, fake digital arrests, drugs/narcotics in courier, impersonation as police officials, arrest in sex racket etc,” the government said.The system identifies and blocks such numbers before scammers reach potential victims. As per the government, the system has identified and blocked about 1.35 crore calls as spoofed calls in the last 24 hours, which are 90 % of all the incoming international calls.“Indian telecom subscribers should see a significant reduction in such spoofed calls with +91-xxxxxxx numbers with implementation of this system,” it added.","The system, called ‘International Incoming Spoofed Calls Prevention System’, was launched by telecom minister Jyotiraditya Scindia.

HPE announces first-ever 100% fanless direct liquid cooling systems architecture for AI servers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/hpe-announces-first-ever-100-fanless-direct-liquid-cooling-systems-architecture-for-ai-servers/articleshow/114470977.cms,"What are fanless direct liquid cooling systems and how they work



High-density and high-performance system design, complete with rigorous testing, monitoring software, and on-site services to support the successful deployment of these sophisticated compute and cooling systems

Integrated network fabric design for massive scale integrating lower-cost and lower-power connections

Open system design to offer flexibility of choice in accelerators

Hewlett Packard Enterprise ( HPE ) has announced the industry’s first 100% fanless direct liquid cooling systems architecture. The company claimed that this architecture will improve the energy and cost efficiency of large-scale AI deployments . The company introduced these systems at its AI Day which is held for members of the financial community at one of its AI systems manufacturing facilities.During the event, the company showcased its position in AI across enterprises, sovereign governments, service providers and model builders.While efficiency has improved in later accelerators, power consumption is continuing to intensify with AI adoption, overtaking traditional cooling techniques. Organisations running large AI workloads will need to do so more efficiently.The most effective way to cool next-generation AI systems is through direct liquid cooling, which HPE already offers. This cooling technology has enabled HPE’s systems to deliver 7 of the top 10 supercomputers on the Green500 list, which ranks the world’s most energy-efficient supercomputers.Based on this expertise, HPE’s 100% fanless direct-liquid-cooling architecture brings the cost and energy efficiency benefits that sovereign AI deployments are already enjoying to a broader set of organisations building large-scale generative AI .The system architecture is built on four pillars: An 8-element cooling design that includes liquid cooling for the GPU, CPU, full server blade, local storage, network fabric, rack/cabinet, pod/cluster and coolant distribution unit (CDU).The 100% fanless direct liquid cooling architecture delivers unique benefits – including a 37% reduction in cooling power required per server blade when compared to hybrid direct liquid cooling alone. This reduces utility costs, carbon production and data centre fan noise. In addition, because systems using this architecture can support greater server cabinet density, they consume half the floor space.",Hewlett Packard Enterprise ( HPE ) has announced the industry’s first 100% fanless direct liquid cooling systems architecture.

"Read what Instagram has to say on banning accounts tracking private jets of celebrities Elon Musk, Kim Kardashian, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, and Kylie Jenner",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/read-what-instagram-has-to-say-on-banning-accounts-tracking-private-jets-of-celebrities-elon-musk-kim-kardashian-bill-gates-jeff-bezos-and-kylie-jenner/articleshow/114469164.cms,"Here’s what happened

What Sweeney has to say

What makes this more troubling is that l've received no communication from Meta-no warnings, no explanation. Reporters have reached out to Meta for clarification, but so far, there's been silence.

No matter the intent, this situation reflects poorly on Meta. Across platforms like X and Threads, I've had a total of 38 accounts suspended. The behavior is consistent: these platforms operate without transparency, and it feels like they make arbitrary decisions. X, for example, continues using the same tactics as the old Twitter; the only difference now is who's in charge. Ironically, Elon Musk, who once criticized Twitter for its lack of free speech, is now using the very same techniques— shadow-banning jet-tracking accounts and blocking links to public information that tracks his jet.

It's just a different form of suppression, rather than outright bans.

Facebook parent company Meta has banned Instagram and Threads accounts that track the private jets of celebrities, including Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk , Kim Kardashian, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, and Kylie Jenner, the owner of such accounts claimed. A company spokesperson has confirmed the suspension, providing a reason for the action.“Given the risk of physical harm to individuals, and in keeping with the independent Oversight Board’s recommendation, we’ve disabled these accounts for violating our privacy policy,” a Meta spokesperson told TechCrunch.Jack Sweeney , who is the owner of many such accounts, claimed that links to such handles returned an error message.“The link you followed may be broken, or the page may have been removed.”Sweeney, who became infamous for his @ElonJet account on X, said that the suspension is “reminiscent of all my accounts getting suspended on Twitter.”The account was briefly suspended from X in December 2022 after his jet tracking account annoyed Elon Musk, who called the tracking of aircraft a form of "" doxxing "" and compared sharing this flight information, which is publicly available FAA data, to revealing his ""assassination coordinates.""Sweeney criticised Meta in a letter for not providing any warnings and explanation before suspending those accounts.","Facebook parent company Meta has banned Instagram and Threads accounts that track the private jets of celebrities, including Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk, Kim Kardashian, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, and Kylie Jenner.

Leaked iPhone SE 4 images hint at iPhone 14-like design,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/mobiles-tabs/leaked-iphone-se-4-images-hint-at-iphone-14-like-design/articleshow/114411596.cms,"Image courtesy: Macotakara

Images of alleged iPhone SE 4 dummy units have surfaced online, sparking speculation about the upcoming budget phone 's design and potential for a larger size option.The images, shared by Japanese tech blog Macotakara, showcase dummy units resembling the recently released iPhone 14 . This suggests the iPhone SE 4 could ditch the older design language in favour of a more modern look, featuring flat edges, a smaller notch for the Face ID system, and a single rear camera.The dummy units reportedly have the same dimensions as the current iPhone SE (146.7mm x 71.5mm x 7.8mm), hinting at a familiar form factor. However, the report also mentions the existence of a larger dummy unit, potentially hinting at an "" iPhone SE 4 Plus "" variant with a size similar to the iPhone 14 Plus (6.7-inch display).While Macotakara acknowledges that the existence of a Plus size option is unconfirmed, the possibility has piqued the interest of fans who may favour a larger display on a budget-friendly iPhone.It's important to note that these are leaks based on dummy units, not official confirmation from Apple. While the iPhone 14-inspired design seems likely, the existence of a Plus size model remains unverified.Apple is typically tight-lipped about upcoming products, so fans will need to wait for an official announcement to know for sure what the iPhone SE 4 will look like and what features it will offer.","Images of alleged iPhone SE 4 dummy units have surfaced online.

Apple co-founder Steve Jobs talked about AI 40 years ago: Here’s a video,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-co-founder-steve-jobs-talked-about-ai-40-years-ago-heres-a-video/articleshow/114403621.cms,"This is what is he talks about AI

And so we’re finding the way we’ve built computers in the past isn’t working for the kinds of things we want to do in the future. And we’re examining new architectures, these fancy words like non–von Neumann machines, etcetera. And what we’re doing is we’re starting to look to the human brain. How is the human brain architected? And we’re finding that computers are very good at doing very simple things extremely accurately. And the human mind is very good at doing very complex things adequately. And there’s a ton of people now starting to look to the brain as a model of an architecture to build a computer.

The main differentiation that exists now between the two machines, and I’m going to use the word “machine” to describe the brain for a moment, is that man is self-conscious, obviously. We are conscious that we’re conscious: “I am thinking.” And to our knowledge, no computer or any even of the high primates has yet to say, “I am thinking.”

And so a tremendous amount of work is going on in the artificial intelligence community to try to understand what self-consciousness is, to try to understand if a computer can ever be self-conscious. But I think the biggest thing that motivates a lot of us is, unlike what we just heard, we don’t know. We honestly don’t know whether we are more than just a machine.

And we are building better and better computers. We’re running up against roadblocks. A lot of people are spending the best parts of their lives right now to try to understand the architecture of the brain and how we can make better and better machines to emulate it. And I actually think, by the end of our lifetimes, we’re going to know the answer to this question. And that’s what’s driving a lot of us.

While artificial intelligence as a technology may have picked up steam after the launch of ChatGPT two years ago, the concept is far from new. Apple founder Steve Jobs , a visionary in the tech world, predicted the potential of AI as far back as 40 years ago, envisioning machines that may answer questions and think like humans.On the Steve Jobs Archive , there’s footage from 1983 in which Jobs is talking to people at the International Design Conference in Aspen.The old video shows what Jobs thought about computers at that time, how books may be replaced by computers one day and the amount of work that is being done to understand the architecture of the brain to help machines emulate it.You can watch the video and a bunch of others using this link",Apple founder Steve Jobs predicted the potential of AI as far back as 40 years ago.

Positive but remains cautious

LTIMindtree, India's sixth-largest technology services company, is reportedly focusing on larger clients and leveraging artificial intelligence ( AI ) to secure significant market share. A company executive told Economic Times that LTIMindtree recently won its largest deal ever, a result of its AI-centric approach.Nachiket Deshpande, the company's chief operating officer, stated that AI is being integrated into all services.This strategic shift has led to a surge in large deals, including the record-breaking manufacturing contract . “We are now embedding AI into each of our service, reimagining with AI… Bulk of our large deals that we announced this quarter came because of that differentiated AI offering. This is one of our largest deals in the history of the company, that we signed with a manufacturing client,” said Deshpande in an interaction with ET.In the second quarter of fiscal year 2025, LTIMindtree secured several multi-year projects, including a $200 million deal from a U.S.-based manufacturer. Despite a slight decline in quarterly revenue , the company's large deal pipeline remains robust at over $5 billion.Deshpande explained that the AI-focused approach has enabled LTIMindtree to consolidate multiple vendors into a single provider. Additionally, the company is carefully evaluating smaller clients and may reduce its involvement if strategic improvements are not achieved.While cost reduction remains a significant driver of growth, Deshpande emphasized the company's focus on winning larger market share with existing clients.LTIMindtree, formed in 2022 from the merger of L&T Infotech and Mindtree, reported a 3.2% quarter-over-quarter revenue growth in the second quarter. Despite this positive trend, the company remains cautious about the outlook due to seasonal factors and potential macroeconomic challenges.The company's margin target of 17-18% may be delayed due to factors such as wage hikes and geopolitical tensions. Deshpande acknowledged these challenges but expressed confidence in the company's long-term growth prospects.","LTIMindtree is reportedly focusing on larger clients and leveraging artificial intelligence ( AI ) to secure significant market share.

IT minister gives an update on Nvidia developing AI chip with India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/it-minister-gives-an-update-on-nvidia-developing-ai-chip-with-india/articleshow/114464524.cms,"IT minister confirms development of Nvidia Al chip

Nvidia has reportedly proposed a joint chip development venture with India. This collaboration aims to leverage the country’s growing semiconductor design expertise and tap into the country's expanding market. According to a report by The Economic Times, the world's leading graphics processing unit (GPU) provider wants to use India's huge chip designing base and develop an India specific chip.Citing said people familiar with the matter, the report highlighted that the proposal was presented by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi during a meeting earlier this year.“The government is currently thrashing out the details such as costing, benefits, use cases of such a co-developed chip,” the report quoted one person with knowledge of the matter as saying.According to one of the persons, this co-developed chip can be customised for Indian use cases – such as for Kavach for instance, the Indian Railways' security system. Ashwini Vaishnaw , union minister for electronics and IT, confirmed the development.“Yes, we are discussing with Nvidia the development of an Al chip; discussions are at a preliminary stage,” he told ET.This jointly developed chip could be made widely available to Indian startups, companies, and the government to power a variety of applications under India's AI mission, fostering innovation and technological advancement across various sectors.In terms of design, the core chip is reported to be developed by Nvidia's partners like Arm or AMD, while Indian organisations like Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC) or private chip design firms could customise the 10-20% top layer to suit specific needs.Huang is set to visit India later this week in his annual trip to the country. During his visit in September last year, the CEO met PM Modi.“He (Modi) said to me, Jensen, India should not export flour to import bread. This makes perfect sense. Why export the raw material to import the value add? Why export the data of India, so that you can import AI?” Huang said at that time.","N Nvidia has reportedly proposed a joint chip development venture with India.

Renowned economist Paul Romer , a 2018 Nobel Prize recipient, has lauded India's Aadhaar system as the most significant technological innovation worldwide. Speaking at the NDTV World Summit, he emphasized Aadhaar's role in revolutionizing government services, particularly direct benefit transfers (DBT).Romer attributed Aadhaar's success to the Indian government's proactive approach in utilizing the technology for public good.Unlike the US, where private sector monopolies have hindered similar initiatives, India's government-controlled platform has enabled efficient and transparent delivery of benefits to citizens.Despite facing legal challenges, the Indian government persevered in implementing Aadhaar, demonstrating a commitment to technological progress. Romer contrasted this approach with the more restrictive legal frameworks often found in Western countries.""What people in India saw is that they could build a platform of Aadhaar that was controlled by the government and could be used for the benefit of the people, not to generate wealth for just a...small subset of people,"" he said.Romer pointed out that despite many cases in the Supreme Court against the Aadhaar scheme, the government in India pushed this idea forward and did not let the judges hamstring them, and they achieved this remarkable success.""In the West, we are too hamstrung by the judiciary,"" he said.Looking ahead, Romer highlighted the importance of urban development for India's economic growth. He emphasized the need for efficient land assembly to create modern cities and capitalize on the potential of urban centers.Addressing the geopolitical landscape, Romer expressed concern about the growing influence of empires, particularly China and Russia. He urged India to assert its sovereignty and advocate for a world order based on independent nations rather than spheres of influence.","Paul Romer, a 2018 Nobel Prize recipient, has lauded India's Aadhaar system as the most significant technological innovation worldwide.

‘Episode bears resemblance with OpenAI-Scarlett Johansson incident’

Tesla CEO Elon Musk is being sued by Alcon Entertainment — an LA-based production company behind the science fiction film, Blade Runner 2049. The company accuses Elon Musk of illegally using imagery from the film to promote Tesla's new "" robotaxi ."" Alcon Entertainment, backed by FedEx founder Frederick W. Smith has filed the lawsuit in the US District Court in Los Angeles.The lawsuit names Tesla and Warner Bros. Discovery as defendants.At the ""We, Robot"" event earlier this month, Tesla showcased its much-awaited robotaxi with two gull-wing doors and no steering wheel or pedals. The complaint says that Alcon had denied a request by Elon Musk and the companies to use imagery from ""Blade Runner 2049"" as part of an October 10 marketing event on the Warner lot. ""He did it anyway,"" the lawsuit alleges.It states that Musk did not use exact ""Blade Runner 2049"" images. Instead, the event showcased "" AI-created images mirroring scenes from 'Blade Runner 2049,' including one featuring a Ryan Gosling look-alike,"". The lawsuit alleges that use of AI tools to create near-identical images is ""a bad-faith and intentionally malicious gambit"" to make the event ""more attractive to a global audience and to misappropriate the 'Blade Runner 2049' brand to help sell Teslas.""“Any prudent brand considering any Tesla partnership has to take Musk’s massively amplified, highly politicized, capricious and arbitrary behavior, which sometimes veers into hate speech, into account,” Alcon’s suit explains. “Alcon did not want BR2049 to be affiliated with Musk, Tesla, or any Musk company, for all of these reasons.”Alcon explains that the episode bears a striking resemblance to an incident earlier this year that involved actress Scarlett Johansson and the artificial intelligence startup OpenAI. Despite her refusal, the actress said that the ChatGPT-maker used a voice called ""Sky"" that sounded ""eerily similar to mine”.Alcon’s suit doesn’t specify exactly how much money the company is seeking in damages. It states that it believes Musk, Tesla, and WBD all “understood the unauthorized nature of the image and the improper purpose behind it and encouraged or otherwise lent their support to the improper endeavor.”","Alcon Entertainment, backed by FedEx founder Frederick W.

The All India Consumer Products Distributors Federation ( AICPDF ) has filed a complaint with India's antitrust authority, Competition Commission of India ( CCI ), alleging that quick commerce companies Zomato's Blinkit , Swiggy , and Zepto are engaging in predatory pricing practices.All India Consumer Products Distributors Federation represents 400,000 retail distributors, including Nestle and Hindustan Unilever.In the letter dated October 18, AICPDF complained to the antitrust body that quick commerce companies were practising predatory pricing - or offering deep discounts and selling below cost to lure customers.The complaint claims that these companies are offering deep discounts and selling products below cost to attract customers, making it difficult for traditional retailers to compete. This, in turn, is harming the livelihoods of countless small businesses.The quick commerce sector, which has seen rapid growth in India, offers delivery of various products within 10 minutes or less. While this has reshaped consumer behaviour, it has also raised concerns about its impact on traditional retail.The AICPDF's complaint highlights how quick commerce companies are bypassing traditional distributors and forming direct relationships with consumer goods companies. This practice, they argue, is unfair and threatens the survival of small retailers.The Competition Commission of India (CCI) is now investigating the matter. If the CCI finds merit in the complaint, it could take action against the accused companies.This development comes at a time when the quick commerce sector is experiencing significant growth. Zomato's shares have doubled this year, and Swiggy is preparing for a major IPO. However, the allegations of predatory pricing could cast a shadow over the industry's future.","All India Consumer Products Distributors Federation (AICPDF ) has filed a complaint with India's antitrust authority, Competition Commission of India ( CCI ), alleging that quick commerce companies Zomato's Blinkit, Swiggy, and Zepto are engaging in predatory pricing practices.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114438522,imgsize-156652,width-400,resizemode-4/114438522.jpg"

Microsoft takes on Salesforce with AI agents

Microsoft has announced that it will empower its AI customers to create their own autonomous AI agents starting next month. These agents, unlike traditional chatbots, require minimal human intervention and are designed to automate various tasks, such as handling customer inquiries, the company said at the “AI Tour” event in London.The company is positioning these agents as “apps for an AI-driven world”.To simplify the creation process, Microsoft is providing Copilot Studio , an application that requires minimal coding knowledge.The agents will utilise a combination of AI models developed by Microsoft and OpenAI. Furthermore, Microsoft is offering ten pre-built agents for common tasks like supply chain management, expense tracking, and customer communication, making it even easier for businesses to get started.Last month, Salesforce launched Agentforce Partner Network - the world's first AI agent ecosystem that allows its partner companies to build third-party AI agents to undertake specific tasks depending on the requirements of businesses. These AI agents will be available for installation and deployment.The news comes a few days after Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff criticised Microsoft’s AI solutions , calling them “disappointing”.He said that Microsoft Copilot “doesn’t work, and it doesn’t deliver any level of accuracy.”“Major analyst firms say it’s spilling data everywhere, and customers are left cleaning up the mess. To add insult to injury, customers are then told to build their own custom LLMs. I have yet to find anyone who’s had a transformational experience with Microsoft Copilot or the pursuit of training and retraining custom LLMs. Copilot is more like Clippy 2.0,” he said in a post on X.","Microsoft launches Copilot Studio to let customers create their own AI agents.
