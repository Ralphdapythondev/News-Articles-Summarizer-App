This may be the ‘biggest’ reason why you should use UPI Lite,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/this-may-be-the-biggest-reason-why-you-should-use-upi-lite/articleshow/112258013.cms,"Biggest benefits of UPI Lite: Transaction History

In a world where digital payments are becoming the norm, United Payments Interface (UPI) has revolutionised the way we conduct daily transactions. The National Payments Corporation of India ( NPCI ) launched UPI Lite in September, 2022. This is a streamlined version of UPI that promises to deliver a customer-friendly approach to enabling low value transactions below Rs 500 per day.At present, PhonePe, Paytm and Google Pay support UPI Lite.Another key feature of UPI Lite over UPI is the transactions initiated through UPI Lite do not require any PIN, offering ease of making online payments.But as we dive into the biggest advantage of UPI Lite, you will discover why UPI Lite isn't just an option, but a near-necessity for most users.With the increasing adoption of digital payments, many users find their bank statements cluttered with numerous small-value transactions. This can make it difficult to track larger, more significant expenses or income. UPI Lite, on the other hand, operates on a prepaid model.Users can load up to Rs 2,000 into their UPI Lite account from their bank account. Transactions up to Rs 500 daily or Rs 4,000 in total can then be made directly from this UPI Lite balance. This way, transactions made through UPI Lite do not appear on the user's bank statement. Only the initial loading of money into the UPI Lite account is recorded, making it easier for users to identify major transactions without sifting through numerous small-value entries.However, users will be able to view transaction history in the digital payment app like Paytm and SMSes.Recently, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) announced the introduction of auto-replenishment of UPI Lite wallet, under its mandate framework. This means that customers will no longer have to manually refill their UPI Lite wallets.","United Payments Interface (UPI) has revolutionised the way we conduct daily transactions.

Microsoft-owned GitHub has launched GitHub Models , a platform designed to enable developers of all levels to harness the power of AI. The platform provides easy access to a vast array of industry-leading AI models as GitHub aims to accelerate AI application development and innovation.“Build AI applications right where you manage your code,” said Thomas Dohmke , CEO of GitHub.“We are launching GitHub Models, enabling our more than 100 million developers to become AI engineers and build with industry-leading AI models,” he added.With GitHub Models, developers can explore, test, and deploy models like Llama 3.1, GPT-4o, and Mistral Large 2 directly within the GitHub platform .“From OSS repositories to Copilot Extensions to GitHub Models, it is intentional that we bring as many partners into GitHub as possible.

‘BSNL subscriber count increasing’

Telecom minister Jyotiraditya Scindia has said that a homegrown 4G network is ready and work is on to convert it to 5G . Talking to reporters, the minister highlighted that under Atmanirbhar Bharat , the network’s services will be available across the country through the Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL).“Several people had asked when Jio, Airtel and Vodafone rolled out the 4G network, why not BSNL? It was the prime minister's resolution that if we have to develop a government-run company's network, we will not use equipment from China or any other foreign country,” Scindia said, as per a report by news agency PTI.“PM Modi has resolved under Atmanirbhar Bharat that India will develop its own 4G stack, core system or towers called radiation access network (RAN). India will develop its technology and give a 4G network to countrymen, and it took us one and a half years. Bharat has become the fifth country to have its own indigenous technology,” the minister said.Scindia also provided an update on the infrastructure, saying that the work of erecting the towers is underway. Companies such as Tejas Network, C-DOT and TCS have been working in various fields, and BSNL is implementing the tech.“We will install 80,000 towers by the end of October and the remaining 21,000 by March next year, which means one lakh towers of 4G network will be installed by March 2025,” he said, adding that this will help in speedy downloads and watching television.“We can use 5G on this 4G core. We will have to make some changes in the towers for 5G services, and work on this is underway. We will soon complete the journey from 4G to 5G,” Scindia noted.Scindia also said that the subscriber base for the government-run BSNL has been increasing. He claimed several telecom customers are switching to BSNL from private service providers.“We have assured them that our service will be prompt,” he said. As per a report in Economic Times, BSNL added over 2.75 million customers since the price increases in telecom tariffs took effect.The minister’s comments came a day after he posted a video clip in which he made a video call using BSNL's 5G network.","Telecom minister Jyotiraditya Scindia has said that a homegrown 4G network is ready and work is on to convert it to 5G.

"Intel to layoff over 15,000 employees: Read the memo shared by company’s CEO",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/intel-to-layoff-over-15000-employees-read-the-memo-shared-by-companys-ceo/articleshow/112211785.cms,"Here’s the full text of the memo shared by Intel CEO

Team,

We have moved our All Company Meeting to today, following our earnings call, as we are announcing significant actions to reduce our costs. We plan to deliver $10 billion in

cost savings

in 2025, and this includes reducing our head count by roughly 15,000 roles, or 15% of our workforce. The majority of these actions will be completed by the end of this year.

This is painful news for me to share. I know it will be even more difficult for you to read. This is an incredibly hard day for Intel as we are making some of the most consequential changes in our company’s history. When we meet in a few hours, I’ll talk about why we’re doing this and what you can expect in the coming weeks. In advance of that, I wanted to preview some of what’s on my mind.

Simply put, we must align our cost structure with our new operating model and fundamentally change the way we operate. Our revenues have not grown as expected – and we’ve yet to fully benefit from powerful trends, like AI. Our costs are too high, our margins are too low. We need bolder actions to address both – particularly given our financial results and outlook for the second half of 2024, which is tougher than previously expected.

These decisions have challenged me to my core, and this is the hardest thing I’ve done in my career. My pledge to you is that we will prioritize a culture of honesty, transparency and respect in the weeks and months to come.

Next week, we’ll announce a companywide enhanced retirement offering for eligible employees and broadly offer an application program for voluntary departures. I believe that how we implement these changes is just as important as the changes themselves, and we will adhere to Intel values throughout this process.

Why Now?

Since introducing our new operating model, we have taken a clean-sheet view of the business and assessed ourselves against benchmarks for high-performing foundries, fabless product companies and corporate functions. This work made it clear our cost structure is not competitive.

For example, our annual revenue in 2020 was about $24 billion higher than it was last year, yet our current workforce is actually 10% larger now than it was then. There are a lot of reasons for this, but it’s not a sustainable path forward.

Beyond our costs, we need to change the way we operate – something many of you shared as part of our Employee Experience Survey. There’s too much complexity, so we need to both automate and simplify processes. It takes too long for decisions to be made, so we need to eliminate bureaucracy. And there’s too much inefficiency in the system, so we need to expedite workflows.

Key Priorities

The actions we are taking will make Intel a leaner, simpler and more agile company. Let me highlight our areas of focus:

Reducing Operational Costs: We will drive companywide operational and cost efficiencies, including the cost savings and head count reductions mentioned above.

Simplifying Our Portfolio: We will complete actions this month to simplify our businesses. Each business unit is conducting a portfolio review and identifying underperforming products. We are also integrating key software assets into our business units so we accelerate our shift to systems-based solutions. And we will narrow our incubation focus on fewer, more impactful projects.

Eliminating Complexity: We will reduce layers, eliminate overlapping areas of responsibility, stop non-essential work, and foster a culture of greater ownership and accountability. For example, we will consolidate Customer Success into the Sales, Marketing and Communications Group to streamline our go-to-market motions.

Reducing Capital and Other Costs: With the completion of our historic five-nodes-in-four-years roadmap clearly in sight, we will review all active projects and equipment so we begin to shift our focus toward capital efficiency and more normalized spending levels. This will reduce our 2024 capital expenditures by more than 20%, and we plan to reduce our non-variable cost of goods sold by roughly $1 billion in 2025.

Suspending Our Dividend: We will suspend our stock dividend beginning next quarter to prioritize investments in the business and drive more sustained profitability.

Maintaining Growth Investments: Our IDM2.0 strategy is unchanged. Having fought hard to reestablish our innovation engine, we will maintain the key investments in our process technology and core product leadership.

The Future

I have no illusions that the path in front of us will be easy. You shouldn’t either. This is a tough day for all of us and there will be more tough days ahead. But as difficult as all of this is, we are making the changes necessary to build on our progress and usher in a new era of growth.

When we began this journey, we set our sights high, knowing that Intel is a place where big ideas are born and the power of what’s possible triumphs over the status quo. After all, our mission is to create world-changing technologies that improve the lives of every person on the planet. And at our best, we have exemplified these ideals more than any company in the world.

To live up to this mission, we must continue to drive our IDM 2.0 strategy, which remains the same: re-establish process technology leadership; invest in at-scale, globally resilient supply chain by expanding manufacturing capacity in the U.S. and EU; become a world-class, leading-edge foundry for internal and external customers; rebuild product portfolio leadership; and deliver AI Everywhere.

Over the past few years, we have rebuilt a sustainable innovation engine that is largely in place and on track. It’s now time to focus on building the sustainable financial engine needed to drive our performance. We must improve our execution, adapt to new market realities and operate as a more agile company. That’s the spirit of the actions we are taking – knowing that the choices we make today, as difficult as they are, will strengthen our ability to serve our customers and grow our business for years to come.

As we take these next steps in our journey, let’s not forget that there has never been a greater need for what we do. The world will increasingly run on silicon – and the world needs a healthy and vibrant Intel. That’s why the work we are doing is so consequential. Not only are we remaking a great company, but we are also creating technology and manufacturing capabilities that will reshape the world for decades to come. And this is something we should never lose sight of as we push forward in pursuit of our goals.

We’ll talk more in a few hours. Please come with your questions so we can have an open and honest discussion about what comes next.

Intel has announced to reduce its head count by more than 15% of its workforce, some 15,000 people, to reduce costs. “Our costs are too high, our margins are too low,” the company’s CEO Pat Gelsinger said in an internal memo sent to Intel employees on Thursday. He noted that the layoffs ""will make Intel a leaner, simpler and more agile company.""In the letter, Gelsinger also said that the software giant will also announce a companywide enhanced retirement offering for eligible employees and broadly offer an application program for voluntary departures next week.","CEO: We plan to deliver $10 billion in cost savings by 2025. This includes reducing our head count by roughly 15,000 roles, or 15% of our workforce. The majority of these actions will be completed by the end of this year.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112211779,imgsize-17172,width-400,resizemode-4/112211779.jpg"

NEW DELHI: A ransomware attack has forced the temporary shutdown of payment systems across nearly 300 small Indian local banks, according to reports. The customers of these banks have not been able to access payments services like withdrawing cash at ATMs or using United Payments Interface (UPI).The ransomware attack affected C-Edge Technologies , a provider of banking technology systems to small banks across the country, reports said.Other banking services are functioning normally, the officials told news agency PTI.In a statement released late in the evening, the national payments corporation of India (NPCI) said, ""C-Edge Technologies….has been possibly impacted by a ransomware attack impacting a few of their systems,"" leading to the temporary isolation of C-Edge from accessing NPCI-operated retail payment systems.Dileep Sanghani, chairman of the national cooperative union of India, told news agency PTI that nearly 300 banks in India, including 17 district cooperative banks in Gujarat, which rely on C-Edge, have been facing issues for the past two to three days.""All online transactions, such as RTGS and UPI payments, are affected. Money is deducted from the sender's account but does not get credited in the receiver's account,"" Sanghani said.""Customers of banks serviced by C-Edge will not be able to access payment systems during the period of isolation,"" the NPCI told news agency Reuters.The statement also mentioned that restoration work is being carried out rapidly in collaboration with C-Edge Technologies, and a mandatory security review is underway.C-Edge, a joint venture between SBI and TCS, serves cooperative banks and regional rural banks, which have been affected by the breach. Officials stated that other banking services remained unaffected. To protect the broader payments system, necessary precautions, including isolating the C-Edge system, had to be implemented following the discovery of the breach two days ago.An industry official told news agency PTI that a ransomware had been detected and isolated within the system, prompting a third-party audit.The official told news agency PTI that the affected banks represent less than 1 percent of the total payment system volume in the country.Despite the incident, no financial losses have been reported, news agency PTI said.","Customers of these banks have not been able to access payments services like withdrawing cash at ATMs or using United Payments Interface (UPI) The ransomware attack affected C-Edge Technologies, a provider of banking technology systems to small banks across the country.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112175695,imgsize-1564323,width-400,resizemode-4/112175695.jpg"

30% of Gen-AI projects will be 'dumped' by the end of 2025 due to these reasons: Gartner,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/30-of-gen-ai-projects-will-be-dumped-by-the-end-of-2025-due-to-these-reasons-gartner/articleshow/112170259.cms,"What early adopters say

Calculating business impact

At least 30% of generative artificial intelligence ( GenAI ) projects will be abandoned after proof of concept by the end of 2025, due to poor data quality, inadequate risk controls, escalating costs or unclear business value, according to research company Gartner , Inc.Speaking at the Gartner Data & Analytics Summit in Sydney this week, Rita Sallam, distinguished VP analyst at Gartner said, “After last year's hype, executives are impatient to see returns on GenAI investments, yet organizations are struggling to prove and realize value.As the scope of initiatives widen, the financial burden of developing and deploying GenAI models is increasingly felt.”A major challenge for organizations arises in justifying the substantial investment in GenAI for productivity enhancement, which can be difficult to directly translate into financial benefit, according to Gartner. Many organizations are leveraging GenAI to transform their business models and create new business opportunities. However, these deployment approaches come with significant costs, ranging from $5 million to $20 million.“Unfortunately, there is no one size fits all with GenAI, and costs aren’t as predictable as other technologies,” said Sallam. “What you spend, the use cases you invest in and the deployment approaches you take, all determine the costs. Whether you’re a market disruptor and want to infuse AI everywhere, or you have a more conservative focus on productivity gains or extending existing processes, each has different levels of cost, risk, variability and strategic impact.”Regardless of AI ambition, Gartner research indicates GenAI requires a higher tolerance for indirect, future financial investment criteria versus immediate return on investment (ROI). Historically, many CFOs have not been comfortable with investing today for indirect value in the future. This reluctance can skew investment allocation to tactical versus strategic outcomes.Earlier adopters across industries and business processes are reporting a range of business improvements that vary by use case, job type and skill level of the worker. According to a recent Gartner survey, respondents reported 15.8% revenue increase, 15.2% cost savings and 22.6% productivity improvement on average. The survey of 822 business leaders was conducted between September and November 2023.“This data serves as a valuable reference point for assessing the business value derived from GenAI business model innovation,” said Sallam. “But it’s important to acknowledge the challenges in estimating that value, as benefits are very company, use case, role and workforce specific. Often, the impact may not be immediately evident and may materialize over time. However, this delay doesn’t diminish the potential benefits.”By analyzing the business value and the total costs of GenAI business model innovation, organizations can establish the direct ROI and future value impact, according to Gartner. This serves as a crucial tool for making informed investment decisions about GenAI business model innovation.“If the business outcomes meet or exceed expectations, it presents an opportunity to expand investments by scaling GenAI innovation and usage across a broader user base, or implementing it in additional business divisions,” said Sallam. “However, if they fall short, it may be necessary to explore alternative innovation scenarios. These insights help organizations strategically allocate resources and determine the most effective path forward.”","At least 30% of generative artificial intelligence projects will be abandoned after proof of concept by the end of 2025, according to research company Gartner.

Many individuals fall prey to fraudulent activities, losing hard-earned money in the process.If you have experienced such a situation, it is essential to remain calm and take immediate action. This guide outlines the crucial steps to follow if you lose money via UPI, credit/debit cards, or ATM scams , helping you secure your finances and increase the chances of recovery.As soon as you detect any unauthorised transaction, contact your bank or card issuer immediately. Most financial institutions have dedicated helplines for reporting fraud. Time is critical in these situations; the sooner you report, the better the chances of freezing the fraudulent transaction. Provide all necessary details, including the transaction amount, time, and any relevant information that can assist in the investigation.To prevent further unauthorised transactions, request your bank to block your card or freeze your UPI account. This step is vital in minimising the potential damage to your finances. Most banks offer this service through their customer service numbers or mobile apps. Additionally, changing your online banking passwords and securing your accounts is advisable.Visit your bank's nearest branch or use their online complaint system to file a detailed report about the fraud.
