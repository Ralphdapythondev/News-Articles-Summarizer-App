Google Chrome is all set to get Gemini Nano integration. Announced at Google I/O, Gemini Nano will first be used to supercharge the "" Help Me Write "" feature, offering users real-time writing assistance directly within the Chrome browser.For those unaware, ""Help Me Write"" debuted earlier this year, offering basic assistance with drafting emails, social media posts, and other text formats.Now, with Gemini Nano on board, users can expect a more refined and efficient experience. The AI model will analyze your writing in real-time, suggesting improvements, generating creative text formats, and overall streamlining the writing process.A key advantage of Gemini Nano is its ability to run locally on your device. Unlike some cloud-based AI solutions, this ensures your writing prompts and data remain private. Processing happens directly on your computer, eliminating concerns about information being sent to external servers.The integration of Gemini Nano with ""Help Me Write"" is expected to begin with Chrome version 126, currently available in the Canary channel. A wider rollout for all users is likely to follow in the coming months. This phased approach allows Google to gather feedback and ensure a smooth transition for Chrome users.While ""Help Me Write"" is the initial focus, the possibilities extend far beyond. Developers will soon have access to Gemini Nano through high-level APIs, allowing them to integrate features like translation, captioning, and transcription into their web applications.","Google Chrome is set to get Gemini Nano integration.

Gemini Nano is going multimodal

Gemini app will be more context-aware

Using AI to make Android more accessible to visually challenged

AI to help you detect spam calls

Circle to Search will now help students with homework, too

Google’s I/O this year was all about AI, whether it be search, workspace, or every other app and service of the company is getting lofty of AI features, so how could Android miss out on all the fun? If you have been running Android, it is going to get smarter with the Gemini Nano model, and the Gemini app , what the company calls “a new kind of assistant.” Google says that these updates should change the way people interact with their phones.So, let’s have a look at what’s new with Android, shall we?Android's built-in AI model, Gemini Nano, is also receiving a significant upgrade. The next major update, Gemini Nano with Multimodality, will expand the on-device model's capabilities beyond text input, allowing it to process sights, sounds, and spoken language. The multimodal capabilities should arrive later this year on Pixel phones.Gemini Nano will power new features such as Dynamic Suggestions, which will provide users with relevant suggestions based on the content displayed on their screen.The Gemini app, which is replacing Google Assistant on Android, is set to become more context-aware and integrated with other Google apps. Users will soon be able to access the Gemini overlay while using other apps, allowing them to seamlessly use AI features without switching between apps.If you watch a lot of YouTube, then there’s a new “Ask this video” button, which will bring up the Gemini overlay and help you with questions relevant to the video. There’s also an ""Ask this PDF"" feature, which will be introduced for Gemini Advanced subscribers. As the name implies, the feature will let users get answers from documents without having to go through all the pages.With Gemini, users could not only create AI-generated images but also drag and drop them into Gmail, Google Messages, and other apps.Additionally, Gemini Nano will enhance the TalkBack feature, generating rich descriptions for unlabeled images without requiring an internet connection. This improvement will make Android devices more accessible to users with visual impairments.Google is leveraging Gemini Nano to introduce a new scam detection feature to analyse real-time phone conversations. The AI will alert users if it detects patterns commonly associated with scams, such as requests for personal information or urgent fund transfers. This opt-in feature will operate entirely on-device, ensuring user privacy.Google's Circle to Search feature, which allows users to search for anything on their phone using a simple gesture, has been updated to assist students with homework. Starting today, students can circle a physics or maths problem they're struggling with, and Circle to Search will provide step-by-step instructions to solve it without the need to leave the current app.Later this year, Google's LearnLM initiative will power the feature, which will expand to handle more complex problems involving formulas, diagrams, and graphs.The updated Gemini app , the multimodal Gemini Nano model, and the other features will be rolled out to supported Android phones, which Google says are around hundreds of millions, over the next few months.","Gemini app will be more context-aware and integrated with other Google apps.

When the AI detects these suspicious patterns, it will show a notification on the user's device, allowing them to decide whether to continue or end the call.While the feature could help protect many users from falling for scams, its availability may be limited at first. Considering that Gemini Nano only works on the Google Pixel 8 Pro and Samsung S24 series, the feature should remain limited to these phones and the others getting support in the future.Google says that users will have to choose to turn on the scam detection feature, so the users won’t have to worry much about the AI listening to their calls.The company is still testing this feature and will have more to tell us later this summer, most probably when the Android 15 nears the stable rollout.","The feature will be built into a future version of the Android operating system.

AI Overviews provides quick summaries and relevant links

Search is now offering AI Overviews, a feature that automatically generates concise summaries of topics directly within search results.

This eliminates the need to gather information from multiple sources. AI Overviews will be rolled out to all users in the US this week, ultimately reaching over a billion users globally by year-end.

Google

says that links presented within AI Overviews receive more clicks compared to traditional search results.

It also highlighted that ads will continue to be clearly labelled and displayed in dedicated sections.

Soon, users will have the option to customise their AI Overviews, including the ability to simplify the language or expand the details provided. On desktops, users will be able to choose from ""Original,"" ""Simpler,"" and ""Break It Down"" options within the AI Overview section.

AI summaries will understand complex questions

The AI Overview in Google Search will be able to handle complex questions with all specific needs and considerations in one go.

For example, when searching for a yoga studio, users can ask the Search to suggest a place that is popular with locals, have a convenient commute from their location, and offer a new member discount.

Also, it will soon assist users with planning, starting with meals and vacations. Search will soon categorise AI-generated results pages findings under creative AI-crafted headlines. This feature will initially launch for US users searching for dining and recipe inspiration (English searches).

How GPT-4o is ""more human than ever""

OpenAI has announced a significant update to its popular ChatGPT platform. This update introduces GPT-4o , a powerful new AI model that brings ""GPT-4-class chat"" to the app. Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati and OpenAI employees showcased their newest flagship model, capable of real-time verbal conversations with a friendly AI chatbot that can speak like a human.OpenAI’s announcement comes just a day before the Google's annual developers conference -- Google I/O.“GPT-4o provides GPT-4 level intelligence but is much faster,” Murati said on stage. “We think GPT-4o is really shifting that paradigm into the future of collaboration, where this interaction becomes much more natural and far easier.”In GPT-4o — the ""o"" stands for omni -- combines voice, text and vision into a single model, allowing it to be faster than its predecessor. The company said that the new model is two times faster and significantly more efficient.OpenAI CTO Mira Murati said in a livestream announcement on Monday. It’ll be free for all users, and paid users will continue to “have up to five times the capacity limits” of free users, Murati added at the launch event in San Francisco. The update brings a number of features to free users that so far have been limited to those with a paid subscription to ChatGPT. These include the ability to search the web for answers to queries, speak to the chatbot and hear responses in various voices, and command it to store details that the chatbot can recall in the future. OpenAI is beginning to roll out GPT-4o’s new text and image capabilities to some paying ChatGPT Plus and Team users today, and is offering those capabilities to enterprise users soon. The company will make the new version of its “voice mode” assistant available to ChatGPT Plus users in the coming weeks.GPT-4o goes beyond traditional text-based communication and can now ""see"" the world around it through vision capabilities. These capabilities include:* Desktop screenshots: GPT-4o can analyse screenshots taken directly on your Mac.* Mobile app integration: An iPhone app (with a Windows app coming soon) allows uploading videos and screenshots for GPT-4o to process.The OpenAI demo mainly featured the company's employees asking questions to the voiced ChatGPT, which responded with jokes and human-like banter.* Real-time interaction: Unlike previous models, GPT-4o allows for back-and-forth conversation without waiting for the model to finish its statement.* Harmonised speech synthesis: GPT-4o can generate different voices and even harmonise them for a more natural dialogue experience.* Sophisticated conversations: GPT-4o offers ""normal"" conversational interactions, translations, and more, all with the sophistication expected from GPT-4 level technology.","GPT-4o combines voice, text and vision into a single model.

In a recent stock exchange filing, the company said it's surrendering its payment aggregator (PA) license obtained from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in January 2024.The Gurgaon-headquartered startup Zomato also withdrew its application for a mobile wallet license.This decision resulted in a write-down of Rs 39 crore invested in its payments subsidiary, Zomato Payments. “The payments landscape in India has evolved meaningfully over the past couple of years since the time we applied for these licences,” the company said in its exchange filings. “At Zomato, we do not see ourselves having a significant competitive advantage against the incumbents in the payments space and hence we don’t foresee a business in payments space as commercially viable for us, at this stage.”The move comes as a surprise considering Zomato just received the PA license a few months ago. The company cited a more competitive landscape and a lack of foreseen commercial advantage as reasons for the exit. Zomato believes established players already have a strong foothold in the payments market.Zomato further explained that the challenges of entering the payments business became clearer as they planned operational structures. This decision coincides with the RBI proposing stricter KYC norms for payment aggregators.Zomato was one of the few new entrants seeking a PA license, unlike most existing players who secured final approval. With established companies like Razorpay and Cashfree dominating the market, Zomato felt it wouldn't be commercially viable to compete.","Zomato has announced that it's abandoning its plans to enter the payments space.

Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max: 4 new camera features Apple may add to iPhone 16 Pro models,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/mobiles-tabs/4-new-camera-features-apple-may-add-to-iphone-16-pro-models/articleshow/110057298.cms,"Upgraded ultra-wide cameras



Tetra-prism lens for iPhone 16 Pro



Improved lens flare control



New Sony primary sensor for improved low-light photography



Apple is expected to launch the iPhone 16 series later this year in September. The upcoming lineup may include four smartphone models -- the iPhone 16, the iPhone 16 Plus, the iPhone 16 Pro and the iPhone 16 Pro Max. The Pro variants in the upcoming iPhone lineup are rumoured to bring new features like larger displays, a dedicated Capture button and more.According to a recent report by 9to5Mac, the Cupertino-based tech giant is also expected to add multiple noticeable improvements to the camera hardware of the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max models. Here are four new camera upgrades that may arrive with iPhone 16 Pro smartphones:Rumours suggest the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max may get an upgraded 48MP Ultra Wide camera this year. This is expected to be a major improvement from the current 12 MP Ultra Wide camera in the iPhone 15 Pro models.This upgrade is expected to offer improved performance in various shooting scenarios, particularly in low-light conditions. Images captured with the new Ultra-Wide camera are likely to show greater details and enhanced colour accuracy. The higher resolution will also provide increased flexibility during editing and post-processing.Furthermore, the 48MP Ultra Wide camera in the iPhone 16 Pro may also lead to significant advancements in spatial video recording. This feature, which utilises both the Main and Ultra Wide lenses, may enable the iPhone 16 Pro to record spatial video in 4K resolution. To compare, the iPhone 15 Pro is limited to recording spatial video at 1080p resolution.The current iPhone 15 Pro Max features a new tetra-prism camera design which offers 5x optical zoom and 25x digital zoom capabilities. With the upcoming iPhone 16 lineup, Apple is reportedly planning to extend this upgraded tetra-prism camera to the smaller iPhone 16 Pro model as well. This means both the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max will offer at least 5x optical zoom and 25x digital zoom.Rumours also suggest that the iPhone 16 Pro Max might feature a “periscope ultra-long telephoto combination.” This technology could potentially enable optical zoom greater than 5x.A common issue faced by most iPhone users is capturing lens flare while shooting in bright lighting conditions. This results in unexpected artefacts and internal reflections showing on images. While this problem is prevalent across most cameras on the market, Apple is reportedly working on a solution for the iPhone 16 Pro.According to rumours, Apple is testing a new ""atomic layer deposition"" (ALD) lens coating technology for the iPhone 16 Pro models. This anti-reflective coating could be applied to the iPhone 16 Pro's camera lenses to reduce the impact of internal reflections.If this rumour is true, users can expect fewer unexpected artefacts in images captured with the iPhone 16 Pro, particularly in bright lighting scenarios.The iPhone 16 Pro is expected to feature a new main camera sensor from Sony, which is designed to improve low-light performance.As per the report, Sony's latest stacked sensor technology separates the photodiodes and pixel transistors (which are usually combined into a single layer). This separation will allow the photodiodes responsible for capturing light to be significantly larger within the same overall pixel size.Sony claims that this new sensor will capture twice as much light as existing camera sensors. The increased light capture and reduced noise are expected to offer improved photos for iPhone users in all conditions.However, it remains uncertain whether this next-generation Sony sensor will be utilised in both iPhone 16 Pro models.

How were they caught



US-based multinational shipping and courier service, United Parcel Service ( UPS ) has reportedly used fake iPhones , AirPods, and other Apple products to seize its employees who were allegedly stealing from customers instead of delivering their goods. According to the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office (PBSO), four men who were involved in this alleged courier stealing were caught by the police and they are part of a larger criminal conspiracy, reports Bocanewsnow.The defendants, Joseph Nunnally, Payton Brooker and Christopher Ventress have been charged with an organised scheme to defraud.Meanwhile, the fourth defendant, Fouad Saleh has been charged with grand theft, obtaining property by fraud, tampering with physical evidence, and dealing in stolen property. All four arrested UPS employees live in Palm Beach County Florida, US.As per multiple arrest reports filed by PBSO detectives, these men were involved in a scheme to intercept roughly $52,000 worth of iPhones and other Apple products in South Florida.The men allegedly created “ghost labels” while in a UPS facility in Palm Beach County that used addresses flagged by a UPS security system.UPS’ loss prevention system notified the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office which then intercepted the already stolen phones. Detectives placed trackers in the boxes which included several fake phones and then watched as the phones (along with the trackers) were delivered to an address in West Palm Beach.The people at the address then took the phones to Boost Mobile. It was unclear whether they then attempted to sell the phones to the retail store or have the phones activated to resell. While they were in Boost Mobile with the tracked phones, PBSO detectives moved in and took everyone into custody.","UPS allegedly used fake iPhones, AirPods, and other Apple products to seize its employees who were allegedly stealing from customers.

During summer months, many households experience a significant increase in electricity consumption due to higher cooling needs. While staying comfortable during hot weather is essential, it doesn't have to come at the cost of soaring electricity bills. By implementing strategic energy-saving practices, you can reduce your summer electricity expenses without sacrificing comfort.Here you can explore several effective ways to save on summer electricity bills, offering practical tips and strategies that can help you minimise energy consumption and lower your utility costs during the warmer months.From optimising your cooling system to adopting energy-efficient habits, these recommendations are designed to make a noticeable impact on your electricity expenses while keeping your home cool and comfortable.Let's delve into these actionable tips that can help you save money and energy throughout the summer season.The Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) issues BEE Star Labels as a voluntary method for manufacturers to indicate an appliance's energy efficiency. The label uses stars to indicate the efficiency of a product, with more stars indicating higher efficiency. Simply put, the higher the energy efficiency rating of the appliance, the lower its energy consumption. To effectively reduce your home's energy costs, opt for appliances with a 5-star BEE rating. Not only does this positively impact the environment, but it also helps lower your electricity bills. Explore Crompton's wide range of 5-star rated ceiling fans to learn more about BEE Rating Appliances.If your home still uses CFLs and incandescent bulbs, it's time to replace them with LED bulbs. LED bulbs are not just a trendy choice; they are recognized for their energy efficiency and superior illumination. If you're wondering how to reduce your electricity bill at home, switching to LED bulbs is the solution for you.Upgrading to smart appliances is a highly effective method to decrease electricity consumption at home. These devices allow you to automate tasks and manage energy usage efficiently. Consider installing energy-efficient ceiling fans to further reduce electricity consumption. Smart appliances typically come equipped with remote control capabilities, allowing you to schedule operations and conserve power. Crompton offers remote-controlled fans designed for enhanced energy savings and lower power consumption.These energy-efficient fans are gaining popularity due to their brushless direct current motors (BLDC), which operate on direct current electricity. They can help save up to 60% on electricity compared to normal induction motor-based fans. Additionally, they offer convenient features like remote control for turning the fan on and off, timer functionality, and compatibility with voice assistants. To learn more about the differences between BLDC fans and normal fans and how they can help reduce electricity bills, explore further information on BLDC fans versus conventional fans.Implementing a full solar power system for your home can be a substantial investment. However, there are more accessible and cost-effective ways to leverage solar energy. Installing outdoor solar lights in your balcony and garden, along with solar fans, can notably reduce your energy expenses at a modest cost. Additionally, using solar pumps for daily tasks can contribute to electricity savings. It's beneficial to understand the distinction between an electric geyser and a solar geyser to make an informed choice for your energy needs.Maintain your air conditioner at 24 degrees Celsius to optimise cooling and conserve energy during the summer months, effectively lowering electricity costs. Additionally, using a timer to automate AC operation and upgrading to a 5-star BEE-rated model can further enhance energy efficiency and reduce expenses associated with cooling your space.Numerous advanced smart energy metres are currently offered in the market. These metres typically use Wi-Fi connectivity to monitor overall power usage within a home and provide real-time analysis of consumption patterns. Additionally, they can detect power leaks and identify high-energy-consuming appliances. Wi-Fi LED bulbs represent an excellent choice for reducing electricity usage.Regularly servicing and maintaining your home appliances is essential for optimal functionality and efficiency. Appliances that are not properly maintained are known to consume excessive energy, so routine maintenance can prolong their lifespan and reduce energy consumption. Learn more about the importance of cleaning exhaust fans.Install a power strip if you have several electronic devices or appliances that need to be plugged into a single electrical outlet. This allows you to easily turn off all devices at once when they are not in use, preventing unnecessary energy consumption often referred to as ""phantom"" energy loss.One of the simplest and most effective methods to lower electricity costs is by turning off electrical devices such as lights, fans, and air conditioners when they are not in use.","During summer months, many households experience a significant increase in electricity consumption due to higher cooling needs.
