Red flags: Be cautious of these warning signs

WhatsApp investment scams : Scamsters are using social media platforms like WhatsApp and Telegram to trick investors with the promise of fast money. They're creating fake investment groups , pretending to be famous brands and professionals, and offering phony stock tips and trading courses .According to ET, scamsters send group invitations to WhatsApp users, claiming to be from a well-known fund house.The messages promise free access to high-quality investment portfolios and daily stock recommendations as part of an online event celebrating the fund's anniversary in India.1. Victims are added to random WhatsApp investing groups.2. Multiple groups are created simultaneously.3. The profile of a famous investor and their credentials are shared with group members.4. Discussions begin in the group, with some members hyping up upcoming 'lessons' or 'opportunities'.5. Initial stock tips are shared for free, with conflicting tips shared in other groups.6. Some tips work in favor of certain groups, encouraging members to invest more.7. Less successful groups are abandoned.8. Active members are pushed to invest in special programs with promises of bigger rewards.9. If a victim refuses to invest more or tries to withdraw funds, their account is disabled, and the WhatsApp group is deactivated. Scammers vanish with the victims' funds.These scamsters employ a very common tactic to impersonate renowned fund managers, financial advisors , and influential figures within the finance community. By leveraging the identities of individuals like Porinju Veliyath and Ajay Kacholia, these fraudsters aim to lend an air of credibility to their operations, preying on investors' desire for lucrative stock tips, the financial daily’s report said.Santosh Joseph, Founder of Germinate Investor Services, was quoted as saying, “These scamsters prey on investors’ appetite for stock tips, particularly coming from star names.”They might pose as an investment academy or class, with a 'professor' or 'teacher' (often the impersonated individual). Discussions in group chats are often scripted, with members expressing excitement about upcoming opportunities or asking about the trading program. Usually, these active participants are affiliates who pretend to be genuine members, adding a false sense of legitimacy to the operation.Rahul Ghose, CEO of Hedged.in, says, “Messages planted by their own affiliates gives the entire set-up a feel of legitimacy.”Some scamsters even mention past trading successes under the 'teacher's' guidance, providing screenshots as evidence. This is to create a fear of missing out (FOMO) among unsuspecting members. They also create a sense of urgency by pushing a 'limited time opportunity' or warning of missing out on profitable trades. Another tactic is to offer investors a free 'trial' period to test the waters. Initial stock tips may be given for free to build confidence.Many of these scams operate as 'pump and dump' schemes. The scamsters or their associates convince people to buy stocks they already hold. They artificially inflate the stock price through circular trading. Once enough people buy, they sell their shares at a significant profit, causing the stock price to drop sharply. Other scams involve enticing people to transfer money in exchange for supposedly lucrative tips or recommendations. These tips are fake, so scammers create multiple investor groups, suggesting different ideas to each group.Ghose points out that different groups receive conflicting 'buy-sell' calls. Because some of these 'ideas' will succeed, members of those groups are pushed to invest more. Meanwhile, other groups are abandoned, and the cycle repeats.Investors should be cautious and watch for signs of fraud. If you receive a random invitation to join a trading community from unknown contacts, proceed with caution. Avoid falling for promises of quick wealth or guaranteed returns. As Santosh Joseph advises, ""Stay away from stock tips, no matter who shares them.""If an investing group claims affiliation with a trusted name or brand, verify its authenticity by reaching out to the person or company through social media or email, as recommended by Rahul Ghose. They're likely to identify any scam. Lastly, be wary of requests to send money through unverified links or download third-party apps, as these could be suspicious.","Scamsters are using social media platforms like WhatsApp and Telegram to trick investors with the promise of fast money.

Depth of credit: This refers to the duration of your existing credit history, calculated from the opening date of your oldest credit account.2. Long-term trend of outstanding balances: The overall trend of outstanding balances over time affects your score.3. Transaction history on credit cards: How you manage transactions on your credit cards impacts your score.4. Ratio of actual repayment amount to total amount due: This ratio indicates your repayment behavior and influences your score accordingly.5. Number of new accounts opened and number of accounts closed: Opening or closing accounts can affect your score, so managing these actions wisely is important.","Your CIBIL score is a three-digit number that reflects your creditworthiness and repayment capacity.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions.This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Scenario 1 – Credit of refund/failed/reversed transaction within the same billing cycle Purchase transaction date – October 15, 2023 As bill is yet to be generated in the given case, the refund amount received on October 19, 2023, shall be adjusted with other debits, prior to calculation of the Total Amount Due. Refund on October 19, 2023 - For cancellation of purchase dated October 15, 2023 Scenario 2 – Credit of refund/failed/reversed transaction post generation of bill but before making payment of the dues Purchase transaction date - October 29, 2023 The bill is generated on October 30, 2023, however, the payment towards the dues has not been made till the date of refund. Therefore, the refund amount received on November 04, 2023, shall be adjusted towards the Total Amount Due (TAD) and accordingly the cardholder will be required to pay only the remaining outstanding (Remaining outstanding = TAD – Refund amount). Scenario 3 – Credit of refund/failed/reversed transaction for which payment has already been made Purchase transaction date - October 30, 2023 As the cardholder has already cleared the dues, card-issuers shall seek explicit consent of the cardholder to adjust the refund amount in line with the provision stipulated at Para 10(h) of the MD. Payment towards dues – November 06, 2023 Case I - If the cardholder gives explicit consent, then refund amount shall be adjusted. Refund on November 07, 2023 - For cancellation of purchase dated October 30, 2023 Case II - If the cardholder does not provide the consent or no response is received for adjustment of the refund, then the refund amount will be credited to the bank account of the cardholder in line with para 10(h). Further, if the cardholder makes a request for crediting the refund (transaction for which payment has already been made), the same shall be credited back to the bank account of the cardholder irrespective of the cut off defined under Para10(h).

Scenario 1

Purchase transaction date: October 15, 2023

Refund on October 19, 2023, for the cancellation of the purchase made on October 15, 2023.

Since the bill has not been generated yet, the refund amount received on October 19, 2023, will be adjusted with other debits before calculating the Total Amount Due.

Scenario 2

Purchase transaction date: October 29, 2023

Refund or reversal occurs after the bill is generated but before the payment due date (November 19, 2023).

The refund amount will be credited to the cardholder's account and will reduce the outstanding dues to be paid before the due date.

Credit cards offer a convenient means to manage finances and enhance financial well-being. By using credit cards responsibly, individuals can build a positive credit history and improve their financial habits. It's important to use credit cards for expenses while ensuring timely repayment of debts to boost credit scores.The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) recently introduced amendments effective from March 7, 2024, alongside releasing updated FAQs regarding credit and debit card issuance.One important question addressed in the FAQs is whether a credit card can be used beyond its sanctioned limit, with over-limit charges imposed, states an ET report. According to RBI guidelines, using a credit card beyond the approved limit (overlimit) necessitates explicit consent from the cardholder. Furthermore, cardholders must have the option to enable or disable the overlimit feature through various platforms provided by the card issuer. Without explicit consent, neither overlimit facilities can be extended nor overlimit charges levied.Here are some key FAQs derived from the Master Direction (MD) - Credit Card and Debit Card – Issuance and Conduct Directions, 2022:Card issuers cannot send credit cards without the customer's permission. If a customer gets an unsolicited card, they should not activate it or agree to its activation. If they don't consent, the issuer must close the credit card account within seven working days at no cost to the customer. The issuer will inform the customer about the closure. After that, the customer should destroy the card. If needed, the customer can complain to the issuer and escalate the issue to the RBI Ombudsman.If a cardholder fails to pay the total amount due by the payment due date, they will lose the interest-free credit period. Interest may be charged from the transaction date on the outstanding amount (adjusted for payments, refunds, or reversed transactions) and not the total due amount. Late payment fees and other charges will only apply to the outstanding amount after the payment due date, not the total amount due.Paragraphs 7(b) and 7(c) of the MD allow the issuance of different types of credit cards that can tap into the limits of various loan accounts. These cards are tailored to match the terms and conditions of the specific loan account. For instance, if a customer has an overdraft facility, they can receive a credit card to access the funds from that facility. The terms of use for this credit card, including interest rates, repayment schedules, penalties, and cash withdrawal limits, will mirror those of the overdraft facility.Additionally, paragraph 7(c) gives card issuers the flexibility to design Business Credit Cards according to their credit card policies. However, it's important to note that banks are not allowed to issue debit cards for cash credit or loan accounts.Which transactions can be used to reduce the amount owed and credited to the cardholder's bank account?In a standard credit card cycle from October 1, 2023, to October 30, 2023, assuming the bill is issued on October 30, 2023, and payment is due by November 19, 2023, here are the possible scenarios for adjusting credit:Activation of a credit card is confirmed through customer-initiated actions such as PIN generation, adjusting transaction controls, Interactive Voice Response, contacting customer care through recorded calls, or SMS communication. If the card remains inactive for more than 30 days from the date of issue, the card issuer must request One Time Password (OTP) based consent, as outlined in paragraph 6(a)(vi) of the MD.For business credit cards applied for by a corporate or business entity, card issuers must obtain explicit consent from the principal account holder, as specified in paragraph 6(a)(vi). Similarly, they must send notifications as per paragraph 8(b). This consent should come from the principal cardholder, unless otherwise stated in the agreement. Likewise, for retail credit cards, consent must be obtained from the principal cardholder, not from any add-on cardholders.Card issuers are not permitted to apply interest or other charges to unpaid taxes, levies, or charges. This provision, outlined in paragraph 9(b)(ii) of the MD, took effect from October 1, 2022. Therefore, card issuers cannot apply such charges to any unpaid taxes, levies, or charges billed from that date onwards.Regarding transactions eligible for adjustment towards outstanding dues and credited to the cardholder's bank account, let's consider a typical credit card billing cycle from October 1, 2023, to October 30, 2023. Assume the bill is generated on October 30, 2023, with a payment due date of November 19, 2023. Here are the different scenarios:- Credit of refund/failed/reversed transaction within the same billing cycle:- Credit of refund/failed/reversed transaction post-generation of bill but before making payment of the dues:","The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) recently introduced amendments effective from March 7, 2024, alongside releasing updated FAQs regarding credit and debit card issuance.

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

He said it was handled by company lawyers so he couldn’t speak directly to why it was included. Around that time, the European Union was investigating Google’s dominance in online search.During his testimony, the executive defended Apple’s arrangement with its tech rival, saying it was the best choice for customers to have Google as the default search engine.“There certainly wasn’t a valid alternative we would have gone to at the time,” Cue said. “I don’t know what we would have done” if the deal had collapsed, he said.Google first became the default option in the Safari browser in 2002. That deal has been revised several times. Cue said the contract was extended in 2021, after the Justice Department filed its initial case against Google’s search dominance the year before.Google pays Apple billions of dollars for this prominent position on products like the iPhone, making the agreement of particular interest to the government. The question before the judge in the antitrust trial is whether the search giant pushed its way onto Apple devices at the expense of competitors.In his testimony, Cue stressed that Apple sees no need to develop its own search tool because Google clearly is the best option. That differs from the company’s approach in other areas: It competes with Google in mapping software and voice assistants, as well as operating systems for phones and computers.The Justice Department displayed an email from 2016 in which Cue told Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook that Google CEO Sundar Pichai was not agreeing to Apple’s proposed revenue share. When the Justice Department’s attorney asked Cue whether Apple would have walked away from the negotiation, Cue said he didn’t seriously consider it, but Apple might have created its own search engine.Part of Cue’s testimony Tuesday was closed to the public because it involved internal company information that Apple and Google want to keep secret.Cue was expected to testify behind closed doors about Apple’s search arrangements with other companies, which provide the non-default options built into the Safari internet browser, according to a person familiar with the planned testimony. That includes Microsoft Corp.’s Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo and Ecosia. Similar to its agreement with Google, Apple gets a slice of the advertising revenue generated when users select those search engines as their main option in Safari.Last week, Apple machine learning chief John Giannandrea testified as well. The executive, who led search at Google before joining Apple in 2018, pointed to a new feature in iOS 17 and iPadOS 17 — the latest software that runs iPhones and iPads — that lets users assign a different default search engine for private browsing.That means Apple users can switch between Google and another option more easily, according to Cue. “We like our products to come out of the box and work where it feels like magic,” he said. However, Apple doesn’t track how many customers actually make the change to a non-Google search engine, because of privacy concerns, Cue said.The case is US v. Google, 20-cv-3010, US District Court, District of Columbia.",Apple’s longtime contract with Google was renegotiated in 2016 to include the provision.

"How TSMC plans to compete with Intel, Samsung for ‘chip leadership’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-tsmc-plans-to-compete-with-intel-samsung-for-chip-leadership/articleshow/109603403.cms,"TSMC faces tough competition from Intel, Samsung

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company ( TSMC ) has announced plans to begin production of its highly-advanced 1.6-nanometer (nm) chips by 2026 as it competes with other chipmakers to maintain its dominance in the chip manufacturing industry over the next decade.The new technology, dubbed “A16,” was unveiled at the North America Technology Symposium in California.TSMC claims that A16 will ""greatly improve chip density and performance” as it will use nanosheet transistors combined with a novel ""backside power rail"" design.This technology delivers power from the bottom of the chip, simplifying internal wiring and boosting energy efficiency.“At TSMC, we are offering our customers the most comprehensive set of technologies to realise their visions for AI [using] the world’s most advanced silicon,"" chief executive CC Wei said at the event, as per Nikkei.Intel previously announced its plans for “backside power delivery” in its upcoming 2nm and 1.8nm technologies, which are expected to come as early as 2025. The US-based chipmaker has also unveiled its 1.4nm technology and aims for mass production at the 1.4nm level in 2027. Meanwhile, Samsung is targeting 1.4nm production for the same year.TSMC's current 3nm technology powers Apple's latest premium iPhone Pro. Industry experts anticipate even more advanced chips will be necessary for future applications like generative AI. To push performance further, companies like TSMC and Intel are adopting a new ""gate-all-around"" (nanosheet) transistor structure starting at the 2nm node. Samsung began experimenting with this approach even earlier.The report also said that currently, only TSMC, Intel , and Samsung possess the resources to continuously miniaturise transistors and advance chip production. The US government, recognising the strategic importance of chip manufacturing, has awarded these companies a combined $21.5 billion under the CHIPS Act to incentivise domestic production.","Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company ( TSMC ) has announced plans to begin production of its highly-advanced 1.6-nanometer (nm) chips by 2026.

How YouTube's new design test may be a 'problem' for the company,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-youtubes-new-design-test-may-be-a-problem-for-the-company/articleshow/109603377.cms,"How the new design became a ‘problem’

YouTube has reportedly decided to end testing a new look for its PC website which it started testing a few weeks ago. The Google-owned video streaming platform may have decided to stop the test as it faced major criticism from testers.Over the years, the video player on the YouTube website has taken up most of the page while the title and description are placed directly below, and recommendations are on the side.Recently, the company started testing a major redesign for its website where the video title, description and comments to the sidebar. With this redesign, YouTube showed bigger and more prominent video recommendations below the playing video.According to a report by 9to5Google, this new design was met with negative comments from testers who saw it. The company also may not have rolled out this new YouTube design beyond a small percentage of testers, the report noted.Most YouTube users complained about being habituated to the old design of the website while others reported usability issues, like for scrolling the comments they had to bring down the entire page which removed the video from view.Several users who received the redesign earlier recently took to Reddit to claim that YouTube’s new design has disappeared. However, many others are still reportedly seeing the new design, so the results may vary. The report also didn’t confirm if Google is planning to give this new design another shot by making it more widely available.Earlier this month, YouTube CEO Neal Mohan took to social media platform X (earlier Twitter) to announce a feature that will make it easier for TV users to skip to the important parts in video. He announced that the platform will now auto-generate key moments in any video that is viewed on the TV.This feature will come in handy in situations where users want to quickly watch a particular part of a video on YouTube that interests the the most. It will also allow users to scroll through lengthy videos.","YouTube started testing a new look for its PC website a few weeks ago.

Drake’s AI-generated diss track has landed Canadian rapper in legal trouble,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/drakes-ai-generated-diss-track-has-landed-canadian-rapper-in-legal-trouble/articleshow/109600067.cms,"""Blatant abuse of legacy,"" says estate

Drake’s diss on Kendrick Lamar had AI-generated vocals of Tupac and Snoop Dogg

Drake's history with AI

Drake 's recent diss track aimed at Kendrick Lamar has landed the rapper in hot water. The estate of Tupac Shakur is threatening legal action over the unauthorised use of an AI-generated version of the late rapper's voice.In a cease-and-desist letter obtained by various media outlets, Howard King, a litigator representing Tupac's estate, called Drake's "" Taylor Made Freestyle "" a ""flagrant violation of Tupac's publicity and the estate's legal rights."" The letter demands that Drake remove the track within 24 hours or face potential legal consequences.The letter states that the estate is ""deeply dismayed and disappointed"" by Drake's unauthorised use of Tupac's voice and personality, calling it a ""blatant abuse of the legacy of one of the greatest hip-hop artists of all time.""""The Estate would never have given its approval for this use,"" King wrote, adding that the use of Tupac's voice against Kendrick Lamar, whom the estate considers a friend who has shown respect to Tupac's legacy, ""compounds the insult.""Released on April 19, ""Taylor Made Freestyle"" was Drake's latest salvo in his ongoing feud with Kendrick Lamar. The track featured AI-generated vocals meant to sound like Tupac and Snoop Dogg taking shots at Lamar.In addition to potential publicity rights violations, King's letter also suggests that the AI model used to create the Tupac vocals may have violated copyrights by ""training"" on existing recordings of the rapper's music.While Snoop Dogg has not publicly commented on the issue, the Tupac estate's response suggests that unauthorised use of an artist's likeness could face legal challenges.AI has repeatedly mimicked the voices of deceased artists like Tupac and Freddie Mercury, and even the living ones like Taylor Swift and Kanye to create renditions of other artists' songs have been opposed.Ironically, Drake has previously spoken out against AI-generated music, particularly in the case of the viral song ""Heart on My Sleeve,"" which featured an AI-generated version of his voice. However, his use of AI-generated vocals on ""Taylor Made Freestyle"" seems to contradict his earlier stance.","Drake's ""Taylor Made Freestyle"" featured AI-generated vocals of Tupac and Snoop Dogg.

"ChatGPT-maker OpenAI announces new security, cost management tools for businesses",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/chatgpt-maker-openai-announces-new-security-cost-management-tools-for-businesses/articleshow/109599572.cms,"OpenAI’s new Private Link security feature



OpenAI’s new Projects feature for better administrative control



Other updates for OpenAI’s Assistants API



ChatGPT-maker OpenAI has introduced some features for its enterprise clients. The Microsoft-backed AI startup claims that these features will be useful for both large businesses as well as developers who are planning to scale up quickly using OpenAI’s platform. The company also revealed it works with several companies including Klarna, Morgan Stanley, Oscar, Salesforce and Wix and helps them build AI solutions and safely deploy its technology across their organisations and products.For enhanced security, OpenAI has introduced a new feature called Private Link. This tool will be a new way for its business customers to ensure direct communication between Azure and OpenAI while minimizing exposure to the open internet.The company has also released native Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to help ensure compliance with increasing access control requirements. The latest feature joins OpenAI’s existing stack of enterprise security features which includes SOC 2 Type II certification, single sign-on (SSO), data encryption at rest using AES-256 and in transit using TLS 1.2, and role-based access controls.Apart from this, OpenAI also offers Business Associate Agreements for healthcare companies that require HIPAA compliance and a zero data retention policy for API customers with a qualifying use case.With the new Projects feature, organisations will have more granular control and oversight over individual projects in OpenAI. This includes the ability to scope roles and API keys to specific projects, restrict/allow which models to make available, and set usage- and rate-based limits to give access and avoid unexpected overages. Project owners will also have the ability to create service account API keys, which give access to projects without being tied to an individual user.Apart from these, the company has also introduced multiple updates to its Assistants API to offer more accurate retrieval, flexibility around model behaviour and tools used to complete tasks as well as better control over costs.OpenAI has Improved retrieval with ‘file_search’ which can now ingest up to 10,000 files per assistant and is 500 times more than the previous file limit of 20. The tool is faster, supports parallel queries through multi-threaded searches, and has enhanced reranking and query rewriting.The company’s APIs now offers streaming support for real-time, conversational responses which was also one of the top requests from developers and businesses.The company has added a new ‘vector_store’ objects in its API for users to add files to a vector store and automatically parse, chunk, and embed in preparation for file search. Vector stores can be used across assistants and threads which will simplify file management and billing.OpenAI’s APIs will also offer control over the maximum number of tokens used per run, plus limits on previous and recent messages used in each run, for users to manage token usage costs.The company’s APIs will now have a new ‘tool_choice’ parameter to select a specific tool (like ‘file_search’, ‘code_interpreter’, or ‘function’) in a particular run. OpenAI’s will also offer support for fine-tuned GPT-3.5 Turbo models in the API.To offer businesses more options to mange their costs, OpenAI is offering customers a sustained level of tokens per minute (TPM) usage on GPT-4 or GPT-4 Turbo. These customers can request access to provisioned throughput to get discounts ranging from 10–50% based on the size of the commitment.Also, business customers can use OpenAI’s new Batch API to run non-urgent workloads asynchronously. Batch API requests are now priced at 50% off shared prices that offer much higher rate limits and return results within 24 hours. This is ideal for use cases like model evaluation, offline classification, summarisation and synthetic data generation.","The Microsoft-backed AI startup claims that these features will be useful for both large businesses as well as developers who are planning to scale up quickly.

Tesla's CEO Elon Musk has sparked fresh interest in the company's humanoid robot, Optimus . According to Musk, the robot could be commercially available by the end of 2025.

A captivating romance can uplift anyone's spirits, and anime has a unique ability to vividly portray these narratives. Over the years, Japanese animation has delivered numerous romantic tales, ranging from light-hearted comedies to deeply emotional dramas.For romance enthusiasts, going through the vast array of anime options can be overwhelming. However, there are several exceptional romance anime series that truly shine above the rest.Here is a curated list of top romance anime series , compiled by Game Rant, along with their respective rankings.Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie stirred mixed reactions upon its debut in Spring 2022, often compared to ""My Dress-Up Darling"" but standing out as a unique slice-of-life anime centred around a charming couple, Shikimori and Yuu Izumi.One distinctive aspect of the series is its portrayal of the main couple already in a relationship, a rarity in anime. While the episodes focus on everyday moments, they paint a wholesome picture of young love with two endearing characters navigating the nuances of romance.Describing Bakemonogatari as a straightforward romance might be a stretch, but this instalment of Monogatari indeed focuses on and highlights the relationship between Koyomi Araragi and Hitagi Senjougahara. Their initial interactions are unconventional, involving a stapler to the face, but Araragi's determination to assist Senjougahara with her curse ultimately brings them closer.Despite the surreal and eccentric nature of Monogatari, the romance between Araragi and Senjougahara is remarkably grounded and healthy. While the series introduces other potential romantic interests, their relationship remains steadfast and central to the narrative.""Sing 'Yesterday' for Me"" presents romance in a refreshingly realistic manner compared to many other anime. The series takes a classic love triangle and steers it in an unexpected direction by the end, resulting in a highly satisfying conclusion that portrays how failed romances can evolve into strong friendships.Directed by Yoshiyuki Fujiwara, known for his work on popular anime like ""Attack on Titan"" and ""Sword Art Online,"" the shift to a show with such a different tone demonstrates his versatility and mastery in storytelling across diverse genres.""My Happy Marriage"" emerged as one of the standout romance anime of Summer 2023, adapted from Akumi Agitogi's novel series. Set in an alternate Meiji Restoration era with supernatural elements, the story follows Miyo, who endures mistreatment from her stepfamily despite her privileged background. Her family arranges her marriage to a notorious military figure known for rejecting wives quickly, with rejection spelling disaster for Miyo. However, Kiyoka surprises everyone by taking an interest in Miyo and becoming incensed by her family's cruelty.The anime delves into the lasting impact of Miyo's abuse, highlighting her struggle to regain self-worth, even with Kiyoka's support. Kiyoka himself is a complex character with hidden motives behind his initial attraction to Miyo, although his feelings for her are genuine.While the romance between Miyo and Kiyoka is heartwarming, ""My Happy Marriage"" falls short in other areas. The supernatural elements can seem disjointed, and the villains are one-dimensional despite being detestable.Based on Fumita Yanagida's popular and finished manga, ""Tomo-chan Is a Girl!"" stood out as one of Winter 2023's most amusing romantic comedies. Tomo and Jun share a close friendship, but Jun sees Tomo strictly as a friend, unaware of her romantic feelings.While romance is central to its characters, ""Tomo-chan Is a Girl!"" leans heavily into comedy. Tomo and Jun's dynamic is charming, and they're supported by entertaining characters like Misuzu and Carol. Despite its comedic tone, the chemistry between Tomo and Jun develops convincingly over the season. Unlike some romance anime, Tomo-chan excels in portraying why its leads are compatible without difficulty.Teen romance anime often dominate the genre, but there are exceptions worth noting. ""Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku"" is primarily a workplace comedy that revolves around two couples: the newly formed pair of Hirotaka Nifuji and Narumi Momose, and the more established couple, Tarou Kabakura and Hanako Koyanagi. The focus remains on Hirotaka and Narumi, with the series emphasising humour over romance, but Tarou and Hanako's relationship is depicted realistically.Despite being childhood friends, Narumi struggles to see Hirotaka as a potential romantic interest, a dynamic that persists throughout the series. The anime's brevity limits the depth of these relationships, but ""Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku"" provides an entertaining journey within its runtime.""Romantic Killer"" cleverly parodies romance and harem anime while paying homage to their core strengths. Anzu, a girl with no interest in boys, is suddenly thrust into a reverse harem scenario by a magical being, disrupting her life of gaming and chocolate consumption. Unamused by her newfound romantic entanglements with unfamiliar guys, Anzu navigates this unconventional situation with scepticism.Primarily a comedy, ""Romantic Killer"" aims to elicit laughter from its audience, often succeeding with its humour rooted in its origins as a shonen manga, characterised by exaggerated facial expressions.Though not always aiming for emotional depth, the anime treats its characters and their relationships seriously. Anzu shines as a compelling lead, and the male characters introduced as potential partners are well-developed. ""Romantic Killer"" offers a delightful blend of humour and romance for those seeking an entertaining and unconventional love story.""The Angel Next Door Spoils Me Rotten"" captivates viewers from the start for several reasons. Firstly, Project No.9's animation is impressive, featuring clean and detailed character designs. Secondly, and most importantly, the main characters exhibit instant chemistry, evident when Amane offers his umbrella to a soaked Mahiru, sparking a connection.Throughout the series, despite the frequent presence of both leads on screen, ""The Angel Next Door Spoils Me Rotten"" effectively delves into their individual personalities while also developing their friendship.Rumiko Takahashi is celebrated as a legendary mangaka, known for classics like Inuyasha, Ranma 1/2, and Urusei Yatsura. While most of her renowned works fall within the shonen genre, Takahashi has also ventured into seinen storytelling. Maison Ikkoku stands out as one of her most mature works, emphasising romance as its primary theme.Unlike Takahashi's prominent shonen series that explore various genres such as comedy and action alongside romance, Maison Ikkoku focuses squarely on romantic elements, enriched with drama, character development, and humour.The central relationship features Kyouko and Yuusaku, both drawn to each other but hindered by their circumstances. Kyouko, grieving the recent loss of her husband, is hesitant to move forward. Meanwhile, Yuusaku, deeply in love with Kyouko, doubts his worthiness as a student. The anime chronicles their journeys of growth, healing, and mutual misunderstanding, complemented by well-developed secondary characters.Insomniacs After School emerged as the standout romance of Spring 2023, adapted from Makoto Ojiro's esteemed seinen manga. The story revolves around two students plagued by insomnia, a burden they carried alone until they met at their school's observatory. Isaki and Ganta form an immediate bond, which deepens as they work together to revive the Astronomy Club, driven by their shared need to preserve their newfound sanctuary.The anime boasts impeccable pacing, skillfully depicting the protagonists' isolation due to insomnia and the subtle solace they find in each other. While romance is a central theme, the series prioritises developing Ganta and Isaki's friendship before advancing their relationship, emphasising the depth of their connection beyond shared circumstances.Kokoro Connect injects a supernatural twist into a classic love triangle scenario. The story centers around Taichi, Iori, Yui, Yoshifumi, and Himeko, students of the Student Cultural Research Club, whose lives take a turn when they receive supernatural abilities from a mysterious being named Heartseed.As they grapple with these newfound powers, the group experiences sensory phenomena that challenge their relationships and reveal hidden aspects of their personalities. The anime is rich in character development, providing an engaging and thought-provoking experience.Maid Sama! carries many tropes that might derail other romance anime: an overly perfect male lead, a strong female protagonist reduced to a damsel, and an unnecessary love triangle. Despite these shortcomings, Maid Sama! shines through its strong personality.The heart of Maid Sama! lies in the relationship between Takumi Usui, a charming heartthrob, and Misaki Ayuzawa, a strict student council president with a busy schedule balancing school, home, and work. When Takumi discovers Misaki's secret job at a maid cafe, it opens a new perspective on the usually composed president.In ""Rascal Does Not Dream Of Bunny Girl Senpai,"" romance plays a subtle yet compelling role that defines the series. The story centers on Sakuta Azusagawa, a high school student drawn to girls suffering from Adolescence Syndrome, a condition linked to their insecurities.While the anime unfolds through different arcs focusing on various girls, the standout is the initial saga featuring Mai Sakurajima, an actress who forms a close bond with Sakuta. Their dynamic crackles with romantic tension, warmth, and clever banter. Although not always in the foreground, their relationship develops steadily across subsequent arcs, leading to a satisfying sequel in the form of a feature film.Wakana Gojou and Marin Kitagawa inhabit completely contrasting worlds. Gojou, isolated and reserved, keeps himself apart from others due to his passion for hina dolls, fearing ridicule. In contrast, Kitagawa is popular, outgoing, and self-assured.Despite their differences, Kitagawa becomes intrigued by cosplay and sees Gojou as the ideal person to create outfits for her. ""My Dress-Up Darling"" is a charming, humorous, and beautifully animated romance anime that excels in executing classic genre tropes with finesse.""Toradora!"" is a beloved slice-of-life romantic comedy that offers a wonderful entry point into the genre. The story revolves around Ryuji Yusaku and Taiga Aisaka, two students who have crushes on each other's best friends.Both Ryuji and Taiga are viewed as outcasts—Ryuji due to his intimidating appearance and Taiga because of her fiery temper. They team up to assist each other in their romantic pursuits. The series delves into their evolving dynamic and the humorous mishaps that ensue as they navigate their intertwined love lives.""The Pet Girl of Sakurasou"" depicts the journey of an eccentric group of characters as they navigate growth and self-discovery. Sorata Kanda is forced to move into the unconventional Sakura House after being kicked out of his school's main dorms.In Sakura House, Sorata encounters talented yet troubled students. When a peculiar young artist joins the dorm, Sorata takes on the responsibility of helping her adjust to her new life. The series delves into the interactions among the dorm mates, their personal aspirations, and the interconnected nature of their relationships.""Ouran High School Host Club"" is a delightful reverse harem anime filled with lighthearted and meaningful moments. Haruhi Fujioka accidentally breaks an antique vase belonging to her school's Host Club and must repay her debt by disguising herself as a boy and working as a host.The series excels in developing Haruhi's character along with her fellow hosts, providing insight into their motivations and personalities. It's a must-watch for shojo fans, featuring a memorable cast of characters that carries the show through its run.Kyoto Animation has produced many beloved anime, and ""Love, Chunibyo & Other Delusions!"" is among them. The series centers around a phenomenon known as Chunibyo, where adolescents have grandiose and unrealistic delusions.Yuta Togashi, who has outgrown his delusional phase, aims for a normal high school life. However, things take a turn when his classmate, Rikka Takanashi, reminds him of his past and tries to pull him back into the world of Chunibyo with her own delusions. The series delves into their relationship as Yuta unravels the triggers behind Rikka's delusions.The trope of opposites attracting may be overused, but when done well, it can lead to a captivating romantic comedy. ""Kimi ni Todoke"" explores the endearing friendship between the shy Sawako Kuronuma and the popular Shouta Kazehaya. Sawako, often mistaken for Sadako from ""The Ring,"" is isolated at school due to her appearance, making it challenging for her to break out of her shell. Fortunately, Kazehaya is just the right person to help her.""Kimi ni Todoke"" is a delightful and heartwarming anime with well-developed characters who evolve as the story unfolds. While it adheres to typical romance anime pacing, the journey remains engaging and enjoyable.Unlike most romance stories that focus on the process of falling in love, ""Tonikawa: Over The Moon For You"" follows a married couple who have already reached that point. As a result, the anime adopts a slice-of-life approach, showcasing Nasa and Tsukasa's daily life and antics rather than a typical romantic journey. ""Tonikawa"" doesn't rely on dramatic highs but instead offers a pleasant and light-hearted experience.While this anime may not appeal to everyone, it serves as a refreshing departure from more melodramatic romance shows. Despite their tendency to blush at the slightest physical contact, Nasa and Tsukasa are refreshingly direct in expressing their feelings, making them both witty and likeable characters.This romantic anime shines because of its main character, Takeo Gouda. His towering, imposing presence contrasts beautifully with his heartfelt affection for the delicate Rinko, which is truly heartwarming. Takeo's efforts to play matchmaker for Rinko with his best friend, despite his own feelings, demonstrate his genuine kindness.Viewers will undoubtedly root for Takeo and Rinko's endearing relationship. ""My Love Story!!"" delivers the goods without delay, as the main characters are dating for most of the episodes, bypassing the typical slow build-up to a confession.""A Sign of Affection"" is a heartwarming romantic comedy centred on college-age love and the challenges of communication. While not the sole focus of the story, Yuki and Itsuomi stand out as the main couple, instantly captivating viewers. Yuki, who is hearing-impaired, communicates using sign language, text, and by reading lips, while Itsuomi is a world traveller passionate about learning languages. Their connection begins on a train and grows stronger with each subsequent encounter.The anime beautifully captures the intense emotions of falling in love, highlighted by a poignant moment in the opening episode. With an older cast, ""A Sign of Affection"" takes on a more mature tone compared to typical romance anime. Throughout the season, Yuki and Itsuomi become increasingly comfortable around each other, resulting in consistently endearing interactions.This romantic anime is ideal for LGBTQ+ viewers seeking representation on screen, but its well-crafted storytelling makes it enjoyable for all audiences. The heartwarming romance blossoms between Mafuyu and Ritsuka as Mafuyu learns to play guitar and sing in Ritsuka's band.Watching Mafuyu's growing confidence alongside the romantic tension creates a compelling series that's hard to resist. The accompanying movie is also outstanding and a must-watch continuation of the series.Nana is one of the most renowned and beloved shoujo anime of all time, a must-watch for fans of romance and beyond. The series follows two women named Nana, seemingly different but navigating curiously similar life situations that lead to separate outcomes.Without giving away how their stories intertwine, Nana's 47 episodes delve into the protagonists' perspectives on love through various relationships. Grounded in reality, the anime explores complex characters who, despite occasional extremes, face accountability for their actions.Your Lie in April, one of the most famous romance anime, revolves around two music prodigies: Kousei Arima and Kaori Miyazono. Kousei, grappling with depression after his mother's death, loses his passion for the piano and withdraws from the performance arts. One day, he hears Kaori playing her violin with such freedom that it reignites his love for music and sparks his admiration for her.The anime delves into themes of grief, life, love, and music. Kousei's journey toward self-healing is profound, marked by heartbreak, but also punctuated by moments of beauty, tenderness, and joy.In this anime, Miyuki and Kaguya engage in a battle of wits to avoid confessing their love first, using their intellect and skills to outmaneuver each other. Both are determined not to be seen as the one who gives in.Their antics running the student council at an elite school with their friends are uproariously funny yet also contain heartwarming moments that will make viewers cheer. Season 3 of Kaguya-sama: Love is War, which aired in Spring 2022, leaned heavily into comedy but also devoted more time to developing Miyuki and Kaguya's relationship and touching on other romances.If the anime follows the manga, the next season of Love is War promises to be predominantly romantic. If successful, this upcoming release could elevate Kaguya-sama to the pinnacle of romance anime.This anime consists of two parts: Clannad and After Story. The latter surpasses the former by a wide margin, but watching Clannad is essential to fully appreciate the impact of After Story. While it features a diverse cast of supporting characters, the heart of the show revolves around Tomoya Okazaki and Nagisa Furukawa, delivering a profound narrative.Unlike typical romance series, Clannad After Story unfolds beyond high school, depicting the growth of Tomoya and Nagisa as individuals and as a couple. The anime tackles real-life challenges without glossing over them, offering a genuine exploration of common struggles.The Dangers in My Heart is truly brilliant. At first glance, it may seem like another typical shounen romance where a popular girl falls for an ordinary loner guy. These stories often offer little beyond wish fulfilment, and The Dangers in My Heart initially appears to fit that mould. Yet, the anime stands out.Ichikawa is an average guy with few friends who daydreams about unusual things. While the anime doesn't delve deeply into these thoughts, it doesn't ignore them either, leaving Ichikawa with a poor first impression. On the other hand, Anna is a cheerful but shy girl who loves food and works as a model. After a chance encounter at the school library, the two start spending time together, developing a friendship that hints at something deeper. Anna encourages Ichikawa to break out of his shell, leading to significant changes in him over the course of two seasons.Although slow-paced initially, The Dangers in My Heart evolves into something special by the end of season 1, maintaining its momentum in the subsequent cour and establishing itself as one of the best romance anime of all time. Anna and Ichikawa are both exceptional characters, but Anna's depth is what elevates the show. She's not just an idealised plot device; she's a fully realised character with insecurities, quirks, and vulnerabilities. Her interest in Ichikawa feels genuine, and vice versa. This is a rare quality in romance anime.Fruits Basket is the definitive romance anime, masterfully blending drama and comedy. Tooru Honda, a lovable protagonist, faces life's challenges until she moves in with the Souma family. The Soumas, particularly Yuki, are school idols hiding a shocking secret that alters perceptions.Love triangles often lack depth, favouring one partner over the other. Fruits Basket defies this norm with its compelling love triangle, where each character is fully developed. Across three seasons, Fruits Basket takes viewers on an unforgettable journey.Also read | GTA 5 cheat codes: List of Grand Theft Auto 5 cheat codes for PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox consoles","Japanese animation has delivered numerous romantic tales, ranging from light- hearted comedies to deeply emotional dramas.
