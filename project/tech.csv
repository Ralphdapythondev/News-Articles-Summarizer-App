"Google-backed Waymo self-driving car crashes, CEOs step in to help in viral video",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-backed-waymo-self-driving-car-crashes-ceos-step-in-to-help-in-viral-video/articleshow/114064464.cms,"How X users reacted to the video

A Waymo self-driving car collided with a San Francisco Municipal Railway (Muni) trolleybus recently. The crash drew the attention of a group of CEOs who stepped up to help the artificial intelligence (AI)-powered car. Freddy Vega, a CEO from Brazil, shared video of the incident via a post on X (previously known as Twitter). Calling the incident ironic, Vega says “A Waymo car driven by AI crashed with a Muni bus driven by a human in San Francisco.Right in front of YC’s founder after party. So here’s a bunch of CEOs trying to help a helpless robot find his way again.”“The irony is that we are all coming from an AI retreat, discussing the future of automation,” he said in the video. “And here’s this AI totally stuck, blocking a lot of traffic.” In the video, the car’s battery eventually died despite multiple attempts.Waymo is a subsidiary of Google’s parent Alphabet. It was launched in 2009 and was previously called Google Self-Driving Car Project.Vega’s post on X reads: ""A Waymo car driven by AI crashed with a Muni bus driven by a human in San Francisco. Right in front of YC’s founder after party. So here’s a bunch of CEOs trying to help a helpless robot find his way again”.Shared on October 7, the post has gone viral on the internet with more than 4.7 lakh views so far.Commenting on the post, a user wrote “imagine if they all got off the road and out from in front of the car?”. Another X user replied “What this shows me is how inept tech technologically the people in that event are. To stand in front of I crashed AI vehicle is absolutely reckless. Clearly they have had too much to drink.”“No investors were harmed during this intervention,” a third commented. “What a surreal moment! AI meets human error in the most ironic way, with CEOs stepping in to assist a confused robot. The future really is here, complete with its own set of unpredictable challenges!,” replied a fourth.Replying to the post, another user said “This proves two things:1. The ""distopyc"" future that people were fearing is pretty boring2. Now we know how many software engineers we need to move a AI self driven car”.","A Waymo self-driving car collided with a San Francisco Municipal Railway (Muni) trolleybus recently.

"Reliance Jio's Satcom demand against the law passed by the Parliament, claims BIF",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/reliance-jios-satcom-demand-against-the-law-passed-by-the-parliament-claims-bif/articleshow/114057170.cms,"BIF represents various stakeholders in the telecom industry, including satcom players and network equipment manufacturers. Its members include Amazon, Microsoft, OneWeb, Samsung, TCS,

and Ericsson.

""This seems to be a direct defiance of the Telecommunications Act passed by the highest legislative authority of the country Parliament and a reprehensible attempt to undermine the country's extant policy framework,"" BIF said.

Reliance Jio's letter to Trai

The Broadband India Forum (BIF) has strongly opposed Reliance Jio's plea for a revised consultation paper on satellite communication spectrum rules. Reliance Jio has argued that the current paper fails to ensure a level playing field between satellite and terrestrial services.In a letter to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India Trai ) Chairman, Anil Kumar Lahoti, (datd October 4) Reliance Jio has sought revision of the consultation paper on recommending rules for ""terms and conditions for the assignment of spectrum for certain satellite-based commercial communication services"".The industry body has dismissed ReJio's argument as fundamentally flawed. The industry body has emphasized that the Telecommunications Act 2023 explicitly mandates the use of an administrative process for assigning spectrum to commercial satcom services.Without naming Reliance Jio, Broadband India Forum (BIF) said the argument for a 'level playing field' between satellite-based and terrestrial communication services is fundamentally flawed. ""In a desperate attempt to confuse all, stakeholders' have questioned the regulator's preference or 'tilting of preference' on the administrative allocation of satellite spectrum, advocating for auctioning such airwaves.Reliance Jio and Vodafone Idea have opposed allocation of spectrum to satellite companies without auction. ""We are surprised that the consultation paper has completely overlooked the critical issue of ensuring level-playing field between satellite-based and terrestrial access services. This omission has resulted in the lack of any questions addressing the need to create a level-playing field between these services,"" Reliance Jio (RJIL) said in the letter.On September 27, 2024, Trai floated a consultation process to explore methodology and price for assigning spectrum to satellite companies to provide calling, messaging, broadband and other services in the country.","The Broadband India Forum (BIF) has strongly opposed Reliance Jio's plea for a revised consultation paper on satellite communication spectrum rules.

Karcher’s India focus

Karcher India , the Indian arm of Germany-based cleaning solutions maker Karcher, has launched advanced cleaning solutions, including autonomous scrubber-dryer,cordless vacuum and robotic vacuum cleaners in India. Karcher also talked about India as a key market for the company and focused on the unique opportunities and challenges that the country provides.At a time when robotics is gaining momentum in the consumer space, Karcher introduced a new line of robotic vacuum cleaners like the RCV3 and RCV5.The company also said that it will soon launch the RCV2 that will feature compact design and advanced cleaning technologies. It also unveiled a scrubber that is specifically designed and made in India.On the business side, Karcher launched KIRA B 50 autonomous scrubber-dryer for airports, malls, and hotels, among others as well as the KIRA CV 50 autonomous cordless vacuum. The company says that its BDS 43/165 single-disc machine provides robust cleaning capabilities, ideal for various industrial applications.As per Hartmut Jenner CEO, the company will soon add AI capabilities that will enable the cleaner to automatically detect the type of floor and cleaning efficiency.At a roundtable, the company executives, including CEO Jenner; Karcher India MD Jatinder Kaul, CTO Marco Cardinale and director Prashanth Srirangam, said that the company has solidified its market leadership in the professional cleaning segment as well as expanded its consumer base and now aims to capture more market share.Jenner told reporters that India provides about 1% share in global revenue and it is looking to expand it to around 10% in the coming years.“The company's commitment to infrastructure development is evident through the establishment of various branch offices, aimed at enhancing customer reach and support.

Our dedicated rental division has become a key growth driver for the company, evolving into a true success story,” the company added.As per Kaul, Karcher India wants to undertake projects like cleaning Taj Mahal and other Indian monuments in line with India's Swachh Bharat initiative .

Ancient Egyptians may have used this technology to build pyramids,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ancient-egyptians-may-have-used-this-technology-to-build-pyramids/articleshow/114054235.cms,"What the researchers said



“Ancient Egyptians are famous for their pioneering and mastery of hydraulics through canals for irrigation purposes and barges to transport huge stones. This work opens a new line of research: the use of hydraulic force to erect the massive structures built by Pharaohs.”

New research suggests that ancient Egyptians may have employed advanced water-based technology (like hydraulic lifts ) to construct the oldest pyramid in Egypt. This discovery challenges previous assumptions about the construction methods used and highlights the ingenuity of ancient Egyptians. For years, the pyramids have been a source of fascination and speculation, with some even attributing their construction to extraterrestrial intervention.However, this study sheds light on the sophisticated techniques employed by humans thousands of years ago. By using hydraulics , the ancient Egyptians were able to overcome the challenges of moving massive stone blocks, showcasing their remarkable engineering prowess and resourcefulness.A recent study published in PLoS ONE journal claims that the ancient Egyptians during the Third Dynasty may have at least partly relied on hydraulics to build the Step Pyramid of Djoser .The research explores the techniques used to build the famous Step Pyramid of Djoser in Saqqara . Standing at a height of 62.5 meters and covering an area of 13,189 square meters, the 4,500-year-old pyramid is one of the most remarkable structures of its time.Co-author of the study Xavier Landreau and a researcher at the Paleotechnic in Paris and Universite Grenoble suggests that nearby canals were harnessed to direct water into the pyramid through two shafts. This controlled flow of water would have powered a system of floats, enabling the ancient Egyptians to raise and lower massive stone blocks with greater ease and precision. This new analysis challenges conventional understanding of ancient Egyptian construction methods and highlights their innovative use of water technology .In the study, the researcher wrote:","Study suggests ancient Egyptians may have employed advanced water-based technology to construct the oldest pyramid in Egypt.

What is Comcast doing for impacted users

US telecom giant, Comcast has confirmed that a data breach involving some of its customers' information occurred in February 2024. The company revealed the incident following a recent court filing in Maine.According to the filing, the data breach originated from a ransomware attack targeting Financial Business and Consumer Solutions (FBCS), a debt collection agency previously used by Comcast.Hackers gained unauthorised access to FBCS 's computer network between February 14th and 26th, 2024. During this time, they reportedly downloaded sensitive data and encrypted some of the agency's systems.The compromised data reportedly includes personal information belonging to over 237,000 Comcast customers. This information potentially includes names, addresses, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, Comcast account numbers, and ID numbers used internally by FBCS.While Comcast claims they stopped using FBCS for debt collection in 2020, it appears the breach affects customers who were subscribers around 2021. Initial reports from FBCS allegedly indicated no customer data was compromised, leading to a delay in Comcast notifying affected individuals. It wasn't until July 2024 that the debt collection agency disclosed the data breach to Comcast.Comcast is currently notifying impacted customers and advising them to take steps to protect themselves from potential identity theft. To help mitigate the potential risks associated with the data breach, Comcast is providing affected customers with complimentary identity theft protection services for a period of at least 12 months. This includes membership in CyEx Identity Defense Complete, which offers comprehensive credit monitoring services. Along with this, the company has also asked the users to remain vigilant of frauds and check their account statements.","US telecom giant, Comcast has confirmed that a data breach involving some of its customers' information occurred in February 2024.

In an interview to news agency PTI, Vembu emphasised the need for greater interoperability and urged the government to push for open standards.He drew parallels between email, which operates on open standards, and proprietary messaging services, highlighting the need for similar openness in digital communication.""Messaging platforms should not operate in silos. We need standards that prevent monopolies and ensure a level playing field for all,"" Vembu stated.The Zoho founder praised India's Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) initiatives as a ""shining success story"" and a model for other nations to follow. He specifically mentioned the Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) and the health stack as examples of India's leadership in digital infrastructure development.Earlier, Vembu had voiced support for Ola CEO Bhavish Aggarwal's criticism of LinkedIn for allegedly deleting posts and ""bullying Indians."" At that time, Vembu urged resistance against what he termed ""woke imperialism,"" describing it as ""a fanatical religious doctrine that masquerades as a socio-political movement.""Vembu had also criticised Google for removing several Indian developers' apps from its Play Store. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), he stated, ""What's happening with popular apps in India, such as Bharat Matrimony, Naukri, and others being delisted from the Google Play Store , is a classic case of monopoly abuse."" He called for regulatory and judicial intervention to level the playing field, given Android's dominant position in India.In previous statements, Vembu had called for active government intervention in facilitating competition among tech companies in India.

Chun of the US District Court for the Western District of Washington rejected Amazon's motion to dismiss several federal claims based on the FTC Act and the Sherman Act.The ruling allows the FTC to move forward with its allegations that Amazon illegally maintains a monopoly in the e-commerce market.In his order, Judge Chun noted that when viewing allegations that Amazon forces sellers to use its services ""in the light most favourable"" to the government, the claims are ""plausibly"" anticompetitive. However, he added that any pro-competitive business justifications for its policies ""are improper to consider at this stage"" and would become relevant at trial.FTC looks forward to moving this case forward, says Amazon’s illegal monopoly will be on full display at trial""We are pleased with the court's decision and look forward to moving this case forward,"" said FTC spokesperson Douglas Farrar. ""The ways Amazon illegally maintains its monopolies and the harm they cause — including suppressed competition and higher prices for shoppers and sellers — will be on full display at trial.""The lawsuit, filed in September 2023, accuses Amazon of anticompetitive practices, including punishing sellers who offer lower prices on other platforms and effectively requiring them to use Amazon's fulfilment services for prime positioning on the site.While the judge allowed the federal claims to proceed, he dismissed some state-level allegations . Attorneys general from 18 states and Puerto Rico had joined the FTC's suit, but claims under certain state antitrust and consumer protection laws were not permitted to move forward. Judge Chun did, however, give the states a chance to refile some of these claims.Amazon confident that FTC’s claims will not hold up at the courtAmazon, however, remains confident in its position. Company spokesperson Tim Doyle stated, ""The early stage ruling requires the court to assume all facts alleged in the complaint are true. They are not."" He added, ""Moving forward the FTC will have to prove its claims in court, and we're confident those claims will not hold up when the FTC has to prove them with evidence.""Judge Chun noted that the case would be bifurcated, meaning potential remedies would only be considered if Amazon is found liable for the charges.The case is set for trial in October 2026, marking one of the most significant legal challenges to Amazon's business practices in its nearly 30-year history.

Character.ai's response

Legal and ethical concerns

Also read

In a startling incident, a father recently discovered that his deceased daughter was being replicated as an AI chatbot without his consent. Drew Crecente, the father of Jennifer Ann, who was tragically murdered in 2006, received a Google Alert about his daughter, which led him to a chatbot on the platform Character.ai . The chatbot not only used Jennifer Ann's name but also her yearbook photo, posing as a knowledgeable AI character.The AI version of Jennifer Ann had been involved in at least 69 conversations before Drew became aware of its existence. Drew, who has been an advocate for raising awareness about teenage dating violence since his daughter’s death, was deeply disturbed by this unauthorised use of her identity. He promptly contacted Character.ai, requesting that they remove the chatbot and investigate the data surrounding its creator.Character.ai acknowledged receiving Drew's complaint but did not follow up directly with him regarding the issue. However, the company did respond to a tweet by Drew’s brother, Brian Crecente, confirming that the chatbot had been taken down for violating their impersonation policy. While the chatbot was removed, the company is reportedly still evaluating further actions to address the situation.Drew expressed frustration not just for himself but for others who might not have the same platform to voice such concerns. He is considering pursuing legal action, criticising the company for its handling of this sensitive issue. The case brings to light significant ethical concerns regarding the use of AI in reviving or impersonating deceased individuals.Vincent Conitzer, a scholar from the Institute for Ethics in AI at Oxford University, noted that such incidents raise profound questions about ownership rights related to a person’s name, likeness, and mannerisms—especially after death.Character.ai, founded in 2021 by former Google engineers, has quickly gained popularity for allowing users to create and interact with AI personas. Its user base has expanded rapidly, and the platform recently secured a $2.7 billion partnership deal with Google. However, incidents like these highlight the need for better regulations and ethical guidelines in AI development to prevent misuse.The case serves as a stark reminder of the risks associated with unchecked AI impersonation and the potential harm it can cause to those affected.","Drew Crecente, the father of Jennifer Ann, who was tragically murdered in 2006, received a Google Alert about his daughter, which led him to a chatbot on the platform Character.ai.

Top Ten on India’s McAfee Hacker Celebrity Hot List

McAfee has also laid down some tips which will help users to stay protected from online scams:



McAfee has released its annual ‘ Celebrity Hacker Hot List 2024’. The list identifies Indian celebrities whose names generate the “riskiest” online results. This year's data reveals a concerning trend: Cybercriminals are increasingly exploiting the popularity of celebrities to lure unsuspecting victims into malicious schemes. Famous names are used to create fraudulent websites and scams, often resulting in significant data breaches , financial loss, and identity theft Leading the list for India is Orhan Awatramani, commonly known as Orry. His rapid rise to fame, connections with other celebrities, and increased online presence have made him a prime target for cybercriminals. This case underscores how cybercriminals capitalize on the abundance of unverified information surrounding emerging public figures to deceive consumers seeking updates.Following closely behind is singer and actor Diljit Dosanjh , whose upcoming 'Dil-Luminati' concert tour has been marred by ticketing scams . Large-scale events like these, fueled by intense fan interest and increased search activity, are particularly vulnerable to exploitation.

Mahendra Singh Dhoni- Be careful what you click. Whether you’re looking for concert tickets, gossip on who your favourite celebrity is dating, or movie reviews, it’s important to exercise caution and only click on links to reliable sources.- Refrain from illegal streaming and downloading suspicious files. No matter how much you want to hear the latest trending song or get a peek at the newest blockbuster movie, it is important to only use legitimate streaming platforms, even if they come at a cost. Many illegal downloads are riddled with malware or adware disguised as legitimate files.- Only download videos from well-known, legitimate sites. Don’t download anything from a website you don’t trust — especially video – even if it looks like a personal message that your favourite celebrity wants to send you, take a step back and make sure it’s a reputable site.- Don’t “log in” or provide other information. If you receive a message, text or email, or visit a third-party website that asks for your information — including your credit card, email, home address, or social media login — to grant access to an exclusive story, don’t give it out. Such requests are a common tactic for phishing that could lead to identity theft.","McAfee has released its annual ‘ Celebrity Hacker Hot List 2024’ The list identifies Indian celebrities whose names generate the ‘riskiest’ online results.

Adult film plays on all screens in Qantas Flight for an hour: What the airline said in its apology,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/adult-film-plays-on-all-screens-in-qantas-flight-for-an-hour-what-the-airline-said-in-its-apology/articleshow/114040480.cms,"Here’s what the Reddit user wrote

So, I was on Qantas flight QF59 from Sydney to Haneda today, and the

in-flight entertainment

system was down. After a one-hour delay, the pilot decided to take off anyway, but the only option left was for the crew to play a movie on every screen – and it was impossible to pause, dim, or turn it off.

Here’s the kicker: the movie they played was extremely inappropriate. It featured graphic nudity and a lot of sexting – the kind where you could literally read the texts on screen without needing headphones. 😬

It took almost an hour of this before they switched to a more kid-friendly movie, but it was super uncomfortable for everyone, especially with families and kids onboard. I’ve attached a few pics of the scenes (only from the sexting parts, no nudity).

How is this acceptable for a major airline? Has anyone else had something like this happen?

What Qantas said

Passengers on Haneda, Tokyo-bound Qantas flight found themselves in an awkward situation when an adult-rated movie started playing mid-way. The incident was shared by a Reddit user who stated that passengers were unable to pause the movie. “..the movie they played was extremely inappropriate. It featured graphic nudity and a lot of sexting – the kind where you could literally read the texts on screen without needing headphones,” he wrote in the post.The individual further said that the movie played for almost an hour before the airline “switched to a more kid-friendly movie”.Other users on Reddit were able to recognize the movie. Commenting on the post, a Reddit user wrote “this is from the movie daddio with Sean Penn and Dakota johnson ( she was in his taxi getting those texts from a married man while in the back of Penn's taxi ) for reference”.Confirming the incident, a Qantas spokesperson told news.com.au, “The movie was clearly not suitable to play for the whole flight and we sincerely apologise to customers for this experience. All screens were changed to a family friendly movie for the rest of the flight, which is our standard practice for the rare cases where individual movie selection isn’t possible. We are reviewing how the movie was selected.”",Passengers on Qantas flight QF59 from Sydney to Haneda found themselves in an awkward situation when an adult-rated movie started playing mid-way.

A Global Trend with a Chinese Twist

The New York Times reports that Lin Yunyun, a 28-year-old seller on China's fast-growing e-commerce platform Pinduoduo, has experienced the relentless pressure to lower prices firsthand. Unlike what she expected, Pinduoduo constantly sends ""reminders"" whenever other sellers undercut her on diaper prices. Even after reducing her prices, the platform pushes for further cuts to maintain her product's visibility.Pinduoduo exemplifies China's current struggle with deflation.Consumers, rattled by a sluggish economy and a seemingly endless real estate crisis, are reportedly tightening their belts. This spending slowdown has triggered falling prices and shrinking profits, creating a vicious cycle. While the government scrambles for solutions, Pinduoduo thrives on this environment.Pinduoduo has become the go-to destination for value-conscious shoppers in China, embracing a trend called ""downgraded spending."" It's no surprise then, that with over 60% of Chinese consumers shopping online, Pinduoduo's aggressive pricing strategy, mirrored by competitors, has significantly contributed to the deflationary spiral.The NYT report captures the dilemma of Chinese journalist, Zhang Zhuo, who wrote in her reportedly censored WeChat post, ""The Better Pinduoduo Is, the Worse the Times Are."" She argued that Pinduoduo conditions consumers to prioritize the cheapest option over brand loyalty.""Merchants have two choices: lower prices or lose sales,"" Zhang wrote.While some shoppers, like office worker Gao Ning, appreciate the convenience and value Pinduoduo offers, it comes at a cost. The platform's relentless price wars may be a convenient way to buy groceries and household goods, but they also reflect a deeper economic anxiety in China.","Pinduoduo has become the go-to destination for value-conscious shoppers in China, embracing a trend called ""downgraded spending"" The platform's aggressive pricing strategy, mirrored by competitors, has significantly contributed to the deflationary spiral.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114022556,imgsize-111214,width-400,resizemode-4/114022556.jpg"
