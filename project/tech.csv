Microsoft introduced its Azure Maia 100 and Cobalt 100 chips -- its first two custom silicon chips designed for its cloud infrastructure . At the US-based tech giant’s Build 2024 annual developer conference, the company’s CEO Satya Nadella announced that Microsoft’s Arm-based CPU is heading into public preview.Nadell revealed that Microsoft has started allowing businesses to preview its new Arm-based Cobalt CPU on Azure virtual machines.During his keynote, Nadella also announced onstage that these chips should include some performance increases for cloud workloads.Microsoft built its custom AI chip that can be used to train large language models and potentially avoid a costly reliance on Nvidia . Apart from this, the company also built its Arm-based CPU for cloud workloads.Both custom chips are designed to power its Azure data centres and prepare the company and its enterprise customers for upcoming AI workloads.The demand for Nvidia’s H100 GPUs which are used to train and operate generative image tools and large language models has increased a lot.Microsoft’s Azure Cobalt CPU, which is named after the blue pigment, is a 128-core chip that’s built on an Arm Neoverse CSS design and is customised for Microsoft. It’s designed to power general cloud services on Azure.The company is currently testing its Cobalt CPU on workloads like Microsoft Teams and SQL servers. Microsoft is also planning to make virtual machines for a variety of workloads available to customers very soon.Meanwhile, Microsoft’s Maia 100 AI accelerator, which is named after a bright blue star, is designed for running cloud AI workloads. This includes large language model training and inference.It will be used to power some of the company’s largest AI workloads on Azure. This includes parts of the partnership with OpenAI where Microsoft powers all of OpenAI’s workloads. Microsoft has been collaborating with OpenAI on the design and testing phases of Maia as well.Maia has been manufactured on a 5nm TSMC process with 105 billion transistors. This is nearly 30% fewer than the 153 billion transistors found on AMD’s Nvidia competitor, the MI300X AI GPU.",Microsoft introduced its first two custom silicon chips designed for its cloud infrastructure.

Microsoft Build 2024 is underway and the company has announced various AI-powered features , including a real-time translation and dubbing feature on the Edge browser . At its annual developer conference, the company said that the real-time video translation uses AI to translate videos into available preferred languages in real-time through audio dubbing and/or subtitles.“With just a few clicks, you’ll be able to open the door to watching many more video across a variety of languages,” said Microsoft. The feature will be available soon.Users of Microsoft Edge can get real-time translation of videos they are watching with subtitles in their preferred language by selecting the translate icon which appears when users hover over a video. The real-time video translation feature will be available on YouTube , LinkedIn , Moneycontrol, CNBC News, among other sites “but we’re always working to offer more choices in the future.”The feature will be available from English to German, Hindi, Italian, Russian and Spanish, and from Spanish and Korean to English, with additional languages and video websites coming in the future. Audio sources in Spanish and Korean can be translated to English.Microsoft claims that the translation is done completely on the device, which means that no data from the video leaves the machine.“This means that no segment of the video or audio content ever exits the machine or is processed in the cloud,” the company added.On the quality of translation, Microsoft noted that there are several factors that affect how accurate the translation – such as the background music, number of speakers, source language, etc.“We are continuously working to improve the quality of translation. However, users should keep in mind that AI generated content may have errors,” the company added.","Real-time video translation uses AI to translate videos into available preferred languages in real-time through audio dubbing and/or subtitles.

Phi-3, Microsoft’s latest small language model is now available with a new capability. At the Microsoft Build 2024, CEO Satya Nadella announced three new AI model s belonging to the Phi-3 family that can run conversational AI experiences on devices like smartphones. One of them is Phi-3 that can now input images and return answers.Phi-3-vision is a multimodal model, which means that it has the ability to input images and text and receive text responses.For example, users can ask questions about a pie-chart or ask an open-ended question about specific images, such as the breed of a dog, name of a flower and so on.“Phi-3 models are powerful, cost-effective and optimised for personal devices,” the company said. Phi-3-vision has 4.2 billion parameters.The Phi-3 family of AI small language models (SLMs) are developed by Microsoft and are now available in Azure, which means that developers can experiment with these models in the Azure AI Playground, and they can start building and customising with the models in Azure AI Studio.Along with Phi-3-vision, Nadella also announced Phi-3-small and Phi-3-medium AI models that have 7 billion and 14 billion parameters.“With Phi models, you can build apps for Android, the web, iOS, Windows and the Edge. They can take advantage of local hardware available and fall back on the cloud when not, simplifying what developers have to do using one AI model,” Nadella added.The development comes a few days after OpenAI, the company in Microsoft has invested billions, announced GPT-4o, its newest flagship multimodal model that integrates text, image and audio processing.

Google makes fun of 'Microsoft's security failures'; with a 'message' for the US government,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-makes-fun-of-microsofts-security-failures-makes-an-offer-to-the-us-government/articleshow/110312340.cms,"What is Google's approach

Google has launched a major offensive to win over corporate and government customers for its Workspace productivity suite, capitalizing on recent high-profile security vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office. Last month, the US Cyber Safety Review Board issued a report slamming Microsoft’s inability to stop China-linked hackers from breaking into the email accounts of US officials last year.The report called on Microsoft to institute urgent reforms.Incidentally, the company’s pitch isn’t quite direct but it repeatedly refers to Microsoft as “the vendor” throughout its blog post, written by Jeanette Manfra, Senior Director of Global Risk & Compliance, Google Cloud; and Charley Snyder, Head of Security Policy, Google.Google suggests that the government should avoid “using the same vendor for operating systems, email, office software, and security tooling.” ""This approach raises the risk of a single breach undermining an entire ecosystem. Governments should adopt a multi-vendor strategy and develop and promote open standards to ensure interoperability, making it easier for organizations to replace insecure products with those that are more resilient to attack.""Google further said, ""Digital security cannot be an afterthought add-on to existing products. Google believes that every software product should first go through a rigorous security review from the beginning of the design phase and throughout the product life cycle.""The company's strategy combines attractive discounts with a focus on Google's security track record. Government agencies switching a significant number of users to Workspace Enterprise Plus can get substantial savings, including a free year and ongoing discounts. Businesses are also offered significant price reductions and access to Google's security expertise through its Mandiant division, alongside free migration consulting.""We’re pleased to announce a new Google Workspace offering to give U.S. public sector organizations more choice – and we’re making the switch easier, as qualifying public sector customers can get favorable pricing for Workspace Enterprise Plus, Assured Controls Plus, Chrome Enterprise Premium, and training and migration assistance,"" said the blog post.",Google has launched a major offensive to win over corporate and government customers for its Workspace productivity suite.

Now, HR and the employees can work on their regular tasks, without the hassle of administration.”Customers can also build Microsoft’s Copilot agents with the ability to flag certain scenarios that may require human review. This ability can be useful for more complex queries and data.This also means that the custom Copilot will operate within the confines of what has been defined and the instructions and actions that are associated with these automated tasks.With data connections to public websites, SharePoint , OneDrive and more, Microsoft is also making it easier for businesses to bring their data into their custom Copilot.","Microsoft has announced new AI-powered Copilot agents for businesses and developers.

Google claims users can expect up to three additional hours of standby time on certain devices. This translates to a significant boost, especially for users who don't use their phones constantly but still experience battery drain throughout the day.The improved Doze mode is expected to be a general feature across all devices receiving the Android 15 update. While the exact improvement in standby time might vary depending on individual phone models and usage patterns, it signifies a positive step towards better battery management for the entire Android ecosystem.The focus on battery optimization extends beyond smartphones. Google hinted that the next iteration of their smartwatch platform, Wear OS 6, will also benefit from the faster Doze mode functionality. This could lead to improved battery life for smartwatches as well.","Google has unveiled a significant battery life improvement in the upcoming Android 15 update.

Apple

may rename existing colours

Apple iPhone 16 series launch is months away. But the rumour mill is buzzing with expected features, design and now colour of the 2024 iPhone lineup. Popular Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo says that the Cupertino-based company may add two new colours to the iPhone 16, replacing the existing ones.The information was shared by Kuo in a post on X, formerly Twitter .In the post, Kuo says that the Pro models - iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max could be offered in black, white or silver, gray or ""Natural Titanium,"" and an all-new rose. The existing iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max are offered in Black Titanium, White Titanium, Blue Titanium and Natural Titanium colours.Kuo reveals that the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus are expected to come in black, green, pink, blue and white colour variants. Apple may also rename previous colours as well, Kuo adds. For example, the existing white could be renamed to starlight. “Also, even if the colour name is the same as the existing model, it may look different”, he says.Earlier, Kuo said that the iPhone 16 Pro Max is expected to feature a new battery with better energy density, potentially enhancing battery life if Apple maintains the same battery size. According to Kuo, iPhone 16 Pro Max will reportedly see a substantial redesign of its battery, switching from an aluminium to a stainless steel casing. This shift not only increases the battery's energy density but also improves its structural integrity. While stainless steel is less effective at dissipating heat compared to aluminium, it offers stronger protection, which could be beneficial for the overall durability of the device.In a related news, display analyst Ross Young said that the display production for Apple iPhone 16 will begin next month. This is on schedule with the timing of last year’s iPhone 15 production and the 2024 iPhone series launch may follow the same timeline as last year.","Apple may add two new colours to the iPhone 16, replacing the existing ones.

Hinton is against the use of AI technology in the military



Geoffrey Hinton , the software engineer who is often regarded as the “godfather of artificial intelligence” has said that he is “very worried” that the artificial intelligence technology “taking lots of mundane jobs”, and said that it will be on to the governments to deal with the impact of artificial intelligence ( AI ) on income inequality.Hinton, who worked at Google until last year, said that while AI will increase productivity and wealth, the money would go to the rich “and not the people whose jobs get lost and that’s going to be very bad for society”.He noted that the government will have to establish a universal basic income , which means that the government will have to pay all individuals a set basic salary regardless of their means.“I was consulted by people in Downing Street and I advised them that universal basic income was a good idea,” Hinton, who left Google to talk more freely about the dangers of unregulated AI, told BBC.Hinton previously said that some of the dangers of AI chatbots were “quite scary”. He is of the view that AI chatbots can become more intelligent than humans and may be exploited by “bad actors”.AI could “evolve to get the motivation to make more of itself” and can autonomously “develop a sub-goal of getting control”, pointing out evidence of large language models choosing to be deceptive.""My guess is in between five and 20 years from now there’s a probability of half that we’ll have to confront the problem of AI trying to take over,” he said.As per Hinton, this will lead to an “extinction-level threat” for humans because they may have “created a form of intelligence that is just better than biological intelligence… That's very worrying for us”.“What I’m most concerned about is when these can autonomously make the decision to kill people,"" he added.","Geoffrey Hinton, the ‘godfather of artificial intelligence’ has said that he is ‘very worried’ that the artificial intelligence technology ‘taking lots of mundane jobs’ Hinton said that while AI will increase productivity and wealth, the money would go to the rich ‘and not the people whose jobs get lost’","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110254760,imgsize-126994,width-400,resizemode-4/110254760.jpg"

Performance testing: Test the phone's performance by running apps, browsing the internet, and checking the camera quality. Look for lagging or freezing issues.

Storage capacity: Determine the phone's storage capacity and assess whether it meets your needs for storing photos, videos, and apps.

In a bold move at the Cannes Film Festival, Polish director Patryk Vega unveiled his latest project, a biopic titled ""Putin,"" featuring an AI-generated deepfake of Russian President Vladimir Putin . The film, which has already been sold in 50 countries ahead of its September premiere, uses advanced artificial intelligence to replicate Putin's face on a real actor’s body.Vega, known for his popular Polish films, decided to use AI technology to create a more authentic portrayal of Putin.""To come extremely close to the dictator, we needed Putin, not an actor with make-up,"" Vega explained. The film’s trailer opens with a striking scene of the Russian leader cowering on the floor in diapers, setting the tone for its controversial narrative.As per an ET report, Vega humorously recounted his approach: ""I called Putin and asked him if he wanted to play in my movie... No, that was a joke."" Despite the jest, the director utilised AI to generate Putin's face due to the lack of sufficient high-resolution images for a full-body deepfake. The results, according to early viewers, are uncannily realistic.""Putin"" chronicles the life of the Russian president over six decades, starting from his childhood at age 10, where he is depicted being beaten by his stepfather. The film culminates in a fictional portrayal of his death, which Vega describes as ""a happy end.""The concept for the biopic emerged during the early days of Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Initially, Vega aimed to make a film about the Russian mafia but shifted focus to what he considered ""the biggest gangster.""Despite potential risks, Vega dismisses fears of reprisals, boldly stating, ""Putin should be afraid of me."" The director's venture into AI has broader implications for the film industry, particularly in Hollywood, where the technology is both a boon and a source of concern. AI advancements threaten traditional roles, especially among special effects technicians and extras, raising fears of job losses.These concerns were central to last year's strike by actors and writers, culminating in an agreement that included compensation for the use of AI-generated likenesses. Despite apprehensions, AI is already extensively used in the industry. For example, it was employed to de-age Harrison Ford in the latest ""Indiana Jones"" film, though studios often refrain from publicising these uses.Beyond film production, AI's applications are expanding in various sectors of the media. The Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media, for instance, uses algorithms to analyse screenplays for gender and diversity biases. YouTube, a significant player in film promotion and distribution, has leveraged AI for over a decade, employing it for automated subtitles and copyright protections.Since April, YouTube has begun labelling AI-generated content and enhancing its detection programs. Justine Ryst, head of YouTube France, emphasised that ""AI isn't going to take over creation. It's going to simplify the complex, and make possible the impossible."" She advocated for a balance between innovation and responsibility in utilising AI.","Polish director Patryk Vega unveiled his latest project, a biopic titled ""Putin,"" featuring an AI-generated deepfake of Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Watch: Sam Altman shares how he spent the 4-and-a-half days he was sacked as ChatGPT maker OpenAI CEO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/watch-sam-altman-shares-how-he-spent-the-four-and-a-half-days-he-was-sacked-as-chatgpt-maker-openai-ceo/articleshow/110203159.cms,"Sam Altman talks GPT-4o and Predicts the Future of AI

The big lesson learnt

Sam Altman , CEO of OpenAI , has been on a rollercoaster the last few years. Since the company's release of ChatGPT, he's widely regarded as the poster boy of Generative-AI world. He's met with world leaders, clashed with Elon Musk , and even joined the billionaire club. Amidst all this, he also got fired (briefly) from the company he co-founded.On a recent tech podcast ""The Logan Bartlett Show"", Altman said with a laugh that if he had more time to reflect, ""every day would have something crazy."" However, one truly surreal moment stands out: His four-day ousting from OpenAI.As reported by Business Insider, it wasn't the firing itself that was unreal. It was how he handled this bizarre situation. Altman described it as an ""insane, superjammed"" 4 ½ days where his body was in an ""adrenaline-charged state.""Within a day of being fired, world leaders started texting. He received messages from 10-20 presidents and prime ministers. He said it felt normal at the time, and he even thanked them without batting an eye.""It was just weird,"" Altman admitted. He barely slept or ate, but his focus and energy were off the charts.Once he got his job back, reality hit him. Stopping at a diner, he realized he hadn't eaten in days. Naturally, he celebrated with a feast: four ""heavy"" meals and two milkshakes (just for him!).The celebratory meal was great, but the real shocker came later. A president texted him, relieved things were settled.Suddenly, Altman realized how bizarre it all was. World leaders texting him during his firing shouldn't have felt normal, but it did. It showed him just how adaptable humans are.""We can get used to anything as the new normal, good or bad, pretty fast,"" Altman said. He sees this as a strength – humans can adapt to almost anything.""My takeaway is human adaptability to almost anything is just, like, much more remarkably strong than we realize,"" Altman said on the podcast. ""And you can get used to anything as the new normal, good or bad, pretty fast.""","Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, has been on a rollercoaster the last few years.
