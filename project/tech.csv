What US Customs and Border Protection rule says

In two separate incidents, unsuspecting travellers from India faced major losses at the hands of US customs officials. A 43-year-old man from Jamshedpur lost goods valued at Rs 30,000 after authorities confiscated items they deemed to be counterfeit products. A student also fell victim to the same fate, witnessing customs officers destroy her luggage worth over Rs 50,000 for carrying suspected counterfeit items.These episodes serve as a reminder for those travelling to the US to exercise caution and ensure compliance of goods import and export with international regulations, especially those with potential intellectual property violations .In the fiscal year 2023, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)-Homeland Security Investigation (HSI) seized 19,522 shipments containing goods that violated Intellectual Property Rights (IPR). This equated to nearly 23 million counterfeit goods .The total estimated manufacturer’s suggested retail price (MSRP) of the seized goods, had they been genuine, was over $2.75 billion (USD). In the same time period, ICE-HSI arrested 434 individuals, obtained 327 indictments, and received 206 convictions related to intellectual property crimes.""According to the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) data, goods under apparel and accessories topped the product list seized as counterfeit. Handbags & wallets came on two followed by jewellery andwatches including smartwatches. Consumer electronics that includes laptops, headphones, among others accounted for 3.1% of counterfeit products seized by the US customs. While the US Customs and Border Protection does not mention the exact name/brand of counterfeit consumer tech products, but it may includeThe US Customs and Border Protection defines IPR violations as any product that infringes on U.S. trademarks or copyrights. Common fake goods include watches, jewellery, importing fake or copied brand designer labels, or sports team merchandise.According to the US Customs and Border Protection, an individual is allowed to carry only one counterfeit item of each type – a shirt, a handbag etc, on the condition that it is for personal use and not for sale. Anything in excess is banned.The rulebook states that the US Customs and Border Protection has the “authority to detain, seize, forfeit and destroy imported merchandise if it bears an infringing trademark or copyright that has been registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office or the United States Copyright Office and has subsequently been recorded with CBP through the e-Recordation program https://iprr.cbp.gov/s/.”The Customs and Border Protection has the authority to keep suspected counterfeits in its custody for up to 60 days. It can also destroy the goods if confirmed to be a counterfeit. Other than this, the custom body can issue a monetary penalty of up to double the MSRP value of the product.","In two separate incidents, unsuspecting travellers from India faced major losses at the hands of US customs officials.

Avi Schiffmann , a notable Harvard dropout and innovator, is pioneering a new artificial intelligence (AI) device named 'Friend.' Designed to alleviate loneliness, this device is poised to make a significant impact on how people interact with technology for emotional support.As per reports, Schiffmann previously gained recognition for developing a widely-used website that tracked COVID-19.Building on this success, he has now shifted his focus to creating a device that provides companionship through advanced AI capabilities. Schiffmann has successfully raised $2.5 million in funding, based on a $50 million valuation. Prominent investors include Raymond Tonsing of Caffeinated Capital and Cory Levy, founder of Z Fellows.True to its name, 'Friend' is designed to function as a personal companion. Designed to be worn around the neck, this device is not just another app but a tangible, interactive gadget that offers a unique user experience. Priced at $99 for the basic white version, 'Friend' is available for pre-order and is expected to ship by January 2025, according to TechCrunch.The 'Friend' device connects to smartphones via Bluetooth and continuously listens to its owner, aiming to provide real-time companionship. Users can activate the device by pressing a walkie-talkie button, initiating a conversation that results in an in-app text response. The constant listening feature allows 'Friend' to send proactive messages, enhancing the sense of an ongoing interaction.Unlike typical apps, the hardware aspect of 'Friend'—being worn around the neck—facilitates easier and more natural communication. Schiffmann describes the product as an ""emotional toy,"" emphasizing its role in fostering emotional connections rather than serving as a functional assistant or therapist. He highlights the effectiveness of large language models in offering emotional support, comparing 'Friend' to existing tools like Replika or Character AI but with the added benefit of dedicated hardware.Schiffmann has assured potential users that the start-up does not store any recordings from the AI device. Additionally, users retain control over their data with the option to delete text records, addressing privacy concerns associated with continuous listening devices.Last year, Schiffmann introduced a $600 pendant called Tab, designed to track and transcribe meetings. Despite receiving approximately $100,000 in pre-orders, Schiffmann pivoted earlier this year to focus on 'Friend.' Customers who pre-ordered Tab can now either switch to 'Friend' or request a refund, reflecting Schiffmann's adaptability and commitment to meeting user needs.","Avi Schiffmann, a notable Harvard dropout and innovator, is pioneering a new artificial intelligence (AI) device named 'Friend' Designed to alleviate loneliness, this device is poised to make a significant impact on how people interact with technology for emotional support.

However, this upcoming update is set to change that.With the new tool, users will be able to fine-tune images with greater precision, potentially altering elements like background, objects, or even the subject's appearance.Users can simply circle the desired area of an image with their finger or stylus and then provide text instructions for the desired changes.

Google Photos is making a significant upgrade to its Memories feature, giving users more control over which faces appear in their nostalgic photo collages. The tech giant is rolling out a new tool that simplifies the process of hiding individuals from appearing in Memories.As reported by Android Authority, Google is now making it easier to hide faces in Google Photos.Previously, users had to navigate through multiple menus to exclude specific people from their photo retrospectives. The new update promises a more streamlined approach, allowing users to directly hide a face from a photo's details page. This change is expected to make the process quicker and more intuitive.While Google hasn’t officially announced a release date for the new feature, it’s anticipated to be available to users in the coming months. This update comes as a welcome relief for many users who have expressed frustration over seeing unwanted faces in their Memories.To hide individuals from Memories in Google Photos, navigate to the app's settings menu, then go to Preferences > Memories, and select ""Hide people and pets."" This action will enable you to conceal individuals from appearing in your memories, creations, or on the search page without deleting any of the photos they are in.The report mentions that Google has simplified this process by reducing the number of steps. As per the APK teardown users will have to now open a photo and swipe to Metadata. After this, they just have to tap on three dots in the People section and tap on the hide face option. Users can choose to either reduce the frequency of a person's appearance or completely block them from showing up in any photo memories.","Google Photos is making a significant upgrade to its Memories feature, giving users more control over which faces appear in their nostalgic photo collages.

Anand Mahindra on AI: …is going to be of significantly more value to us than we imagined,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/anand-mahindra-on-ai-is-going-to-be-of-significantly-more-value-to-us-than-we-imagined/articleshow/112095975.cms,"How X users reacted to Anand Mahindra’s post

Anand Mahindra said that artificial intelligence (AI) can be of more value to mankind than ‘imagined’. Citing a research that showed how AI can detect breast cancer five years before it develops, he wrote ""If this is accurate, then AI is going to be of significantly more value to us than we imagined and much earlier than we had imagined,"".The Mahindra Group chairman took to microblogging platform X (formerly known as Twitter) to share his views.Recently, a team of researchers from Duke University in the US developed a new AI model to predict 5-year breast cancer risk from mammograms.Traditional cancer diagnosis relies on biopsies, microscopic histological examinations, and imaging techniques like MRI, CT, and PET scans. Human interpretation of these tests can be subjective. AI, on the other hand, can analyse medical images with staggering accuracy.An IANS report quotes Vineet Nakra, a radiation oncologist at Max Super Speciality Hospital on how AI is helping in cancer diagnosis and treatment. She told the news agency that AI is helping pathologists diagnose cancer much faster and paving the way for doctors to make personalised and patient-centric cancer care.Commenting on Mahindra’s X post, a user wrote “That's the best use of technology anyway. Assisting human kind to become better and reduce risks”. “AI in the medical field will have a huge impact and will certainly make significant contributions. Google DeepMind's AI system, AlphaFold3, can accurately predict the 3D structure of proteins and has potential applications in drug discovery and understanding diseases,” commented another.“AI, Machine Learning, Big data analysis based systems will drastically improve the living standards of life of every strata of society,” replied a third.","The Mahindra Group chairman took to microblogging platform X to share his views.

IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw stated that neither WhatsApp nor its parent company Meta have informed the government of any plans to shut down their services in India. He made this statement in response to a question raised in the Rajya Sabha recently.“[The] Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) has shared that WhatsApp or Meta has not informed the government about any such plans,” Vaishnaw said in a written reply to a question by Congress member Vivek Tankha, as per PTI report on Friday (July 26).Tankha had asked whether WhatsApp was planning to shut its services in India due to the government's directives to share user details in accordance with the government directions under Section 69A of the Information Technology Act, 2000.Responding to Tankha's question on curbs on social media platforms, the I&B minister said the central government issued directions in the interest of the sovereignty or integrity of India, defence of India, security of the state, friendly relations with foreign states or public order or for preventing incitement to the commission of any cognisable offence relating to above in respect of the information on a computer resource.Earlier this year, WhatsApp told the Delhi High Court that it will stop functioning in India if it is compelled by the government to break encryption of messages.Previously, WhatsApp challenged the newly amended IT Rules saying that they violate the right to privacy and were unconstitutional.

For phones manufactured in India, only the 18% GST is applied. Apple imports its iPhone Pro and Pro Max models, while its other smartphones are produced locally.Post this announcement, Apple has reduced prices of iPhones in India. While the price cut on base models non-Pro is almost negligible at Rs 300, the cut on high end Pro models is up to Rs 6,000.

The incident, which impacted 8.5 million PCs, has led Microsoft to reassess the resilience of its operating system and consider restricting kernel-level access for third-party security vendors .John Cable, Microsoft's vice president of program management for Windows servicing and delivery, outlined the company's stance in a blog post titled ""Windows resiliency: Best practices and the path forward."" Cable emphasised the need for ""end-to-end resilience"" and hinted at potential changes that could restrict kernel access for security software.The CrowdStrike update bug, which resulted in widespread system crashes, has highlighted the risks associated with allowing third-party applications to operate at the kernel level. This privileged access, while beneficial for threat detection, can lead to catastrophic failures if errors occur.Microsoft is now exploring alternatives that don't rely on kernel access, such as VBS enclaves and the Azure Attestation service. These technologies, which utilize Zero Trust approaches, could provide enhanced security without the risks associated with kernel-level operations.The tech giant's push for change may face resistance from cybersecurity vendors and regulators. A similar attempt to restrict kernel access in Windows Vista in 2006 was met with opposition. In contrast, Apple successfully locked down kernel access in macOS in 2020.Microsoft's approach involves collaboration with partners and the broader security community. The company aims to balance improved system resilience with the needs of security vendors who have historically relied on kernel-level access for their products.Microsoft's response to the CrowdStrike incident also included deploying over 5,000 support engineers to assist affected organizations and providing ongoing updates through the Windows release health dashboard. The company has emphasized the importance of business continuity planning, secure data backups, and utilizing cloud-native approaches for managing Windows devices to enhance resilience against future incidents.","Microsoft is pushing for changes to its Windows security architecture.

What OpenAI said about SearchGPT

OpenAI to take on Microsoft Bing and Perplexity, along with Google

SearchGPT may look like Google Overview

(With agency inputs)

OpenAI is testing an artificial intelligence-powered search engine that can access information from across the internet in real time. The prominent AI startup revealed the new prototype, SearchGPT , in a blog post earlier this week. OpenAI plans to integrate its new search engine technology with its existing online chatbot, ChatGPT. In a blog post, Microsoft-backed OpenAI said that the company plans to integrate the best features from the search tool into ChatGPT in the future.Here are the key things to know about SearchGPT.The company said it was testing the technology with a small group of users as well as online publishers who partnered with OpenAI to help build the search engine.“Getting answers on the web can take a lot of effort, often requiring multiple attempts to get relevant results,” the company said in its blog post. “We believe that by enhancing the conversational capabilities of our models with real-time information from the web, finding what you’re looking for can be faster and easier,” it added. Users will be able to interact with SearchGPT through conversational queries, and can ask follow-up questions as they might if speaking to a person, OpenAI said.Other than the search giant Google , SearchGPT launch, announced earlier this week, places the AI giant in competition with its largest backer Microsoft's Bing search and emerging services such as Perplexity — a search-focused AI chatbot firm backed by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and semiconductor giant Nvidia . According to web analytics firm Statcounter, Google dominates the search engine market with a 91.1% share as of June 2024.Google recently added AI-generated query result summaries -- referred to as ""Overviews"" -- to its search engine. This new feature offers written text at the top of results for Google searches, ahead of the traditional links to websites, which summarizes information that the engine believes answers the user's search query. The description shared by OPenAI of SearchGPT appears similar to Google's Overviews.","OpenAI is testing an artificial intelligence-powered search engine that can access information from across the internet in real time.

How X’s auto-consent flouts tech rules in the UK, EU

Elon Musk-owned X recently enabled by default a setting that allows the social media platform to utilise user data to train its AI model, Grok. This means X can use user posts, interactions, and outputs from Grok for training and refining its AI, requiring users to manually opt-out. Now the regulators in the UK and the European Union ( EU ) have reportedly connected with the company over its alleged attempt to gain user consent for data harvesting without their approval.While X claims this data is essential for improving user experience, privacy concerns have been raised. The setting states that users “allow your posts as well as your interactions, inputs and results with Grok to be used for training and fine-tuning”.Users have expressed difficulty in disabling this feature as the option is currently hidden within the web app's settings and unavailable on the mobile app.The move contradicts the tech laws in both the regions as the regulations prohibit pre-ticked consent boxes. Tech companies are not allowed to use “pre-ticked boxes” or “any other method of default consent”.Data protection authorities in the UK and Ireland have expressed their concerns over X's actions, as per a report by the Guardian. The UK's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) is investigating the matter, emphasising the importance of transparency and user choice in data usage.“Platforms seeking to use their users’ data to train their AI foundation models must be transparent about their activities,” said a spokesperson for the ICO.“They should take steps to proactively notify users well in advance of using data for these purposes, and provide people with ample time and simple processes to object to having their data used in this way,” the spokesperson added.Similarly, Ireland's Data Protection Commission (DPC), the lead regulator for X in the EU, has expressed surprise at the development and is seeking further information from the company.“The DPC has been engaging with X on this matter for a number of months, with our latest interaction occurring as recently as yesterday, therefore we are surprised by today’s developments. We have followed up with X today (July 26) and are awaiting a response. We expect further engagement early next week,” said Graham Doyle, a DPC deputy commissioner.","X recently enabled by default a setting that allows the social media platform to utilise user data to train its AI model, Grok.

Karnataka reservation bill: PhonePe CEO and founder Sameer Nigam issues this 'personal statement',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/karnataka-reservation-bill-phonepe-ceo-and-founder-sameer-nigam-issues-this-personal-statement/articleshow/111908948.cms,"Read PhonePe CEO Sameer Nigam’s personal note

“PhonePe was born in Bengaluru and we are incredibly proud of our roots in this city, which is well known for its world-class technology talent and vibrant diversity. From Bengaluru, over the past decade we have expanded across the length and breadth of India and been able to deliver secure and efficient digital payments for over 55 Crore Indians.

Bengaluru's reputation as the ""Silicon valley of India"" is truly well-deserved. The city thrives on an incredible culture of innovation, and attracts the most brilliant young minds from Karnataka and the rest of India. As a company, we are deeply grateful for the supportive business environment that Karnataka’s governments and its local

Kannadiga

populace have offered us. Without such an inclusive ecosystem and progressive policies, Bengaluru would not have become a global technology superpower.

As a company we also thrive on celebrating diversity, we have always tried hard to deliver fair, unbiased and meritocracy-based employment opportunities for all Indians - including to all local Kannadigas. We believe such an approach gives every Indian a good job a chance to shine, and ultimately helps create more societal and economic value for Bengaluru, Karnataka and India.

I read some recent media articles, relating to a few personal comments that I made last week regarding the draft job reservation bill. I would first and foremost like to clarify that it was NEVER my intention to insult Karnataka and it’s people. If my comments hurt anyone’s sentiments in such a way, I am truly sorry and would like to offer you an unconditional apology. I have the highest regard for Kannada, and all other Indian languages. In fact, I truly believe that linguistic diversity and rich cultural heritage is a national asset that all Indians should be proud of; and all Indians should be respectful of and celebrate local and cultural norms.

Bengaluru’s Indian startups are competing against trillion dollar giants like Google, Apple, Amazon and Microsoft. To do so, these companies must be able to employ the very best talent available in India purely based on their technology skills and proficiency in fields such as Coding, Design, Product Management, Data Sciences, Machine Learning, AI and beyond. As a nation, that is the only way we can build world-class companies that can compete in the global village that we live in today.

I also want to help create lakhs of jobs for Bengaluru and Karnataka. And, I believe with more dialogue and discussion, we can find ways to create more sustainable employment avenues. Let’s all work together to do this meaningfully and while creating long-term impact.”

PhonePe CEO Sameer Nigam issued a personal note following backlash over his comments on Karnataka 's job reservation bill. The controversy erupted after Nigam criticised the bill on social media platform X, questioning whether his children deserved jobs in their home city given his company's pan-India job creation.""If my comments hurt anyone's sentiments, I am truly sorry and would like to offer you an unconditional apology,"" Nigam said in a statement.He emphasised his 22-year connection to Bengaluru and respect for linguistic diversity.The Karnataka Cabinet had recently approved a bill mandating 50% reservation for locals in management roles and 70% in non-management positions within private companies.
