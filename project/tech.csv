Google 's Find My Device app which helps in locating lost or stolen smartphones, may soon get a new privacy feature . As reported by XDA Developers the app may soon get biometric unlocking functionality.Presently, the Find My Device app requires you to enter your Google account password whenever you open it. This can be cumbersome, especially in situations where time is of the essence. However, recent findings by XDA Developers suggest that Google is testing a new feature: biometric login.This update will enable users to unlock the Find My Device app with their fingerprint or facial recognition (depending on their device's capabilities). This eliminates the need to remember and type in a password.The inclusion of biometric unlocking would be a welcome addition for many Android users. It streamlines the process of accessing the Find My Device app, potentially increasing its effectiveness in locating lost phones.Another online report by Android Authority reveals that the find my device app will also get a remote lock feature. This upcoming feature will enable users to lock their device using just their phone number and quick security challenge.The report also adds that the remote lock functionality will be available on devices running Android 10 and above. The feature is expected to roll out by the end of this year.","Google's Find My Device app which helps in locating lost or stolen smartphones, may soon get a new privacy feature.

What Meta's AI scietist have to say on AI regulation

The question is similar for AI:

""Do we think there exists at least one design of an AI system that is simultaneously safe/controllable, and can fulfill objectives in more intelligent ways than humans ?""

If the answer is yes, we'll be fine.

If the answer is no, we won't build it.

Right now, we don't even have a hint of a design of a human-level intelligent system.

So it's too early to worry about it.

And it's way too early to regulate it to prevent ""existential risk.""

LeCun says AI will not be smarter than humans



At a time when there has been fears of AI taking jobs and becoming dangerous, Meta 's chief AI scientist Yann LeCun has said that the technology is not a natural phenomenon that it will become dangerous to pose ""existential risk"" to humans. Known as one of the three "" Godfathers of AI "", LeCun has been pointing out that AI will not have human-level intelligence in the near future.""AI is not some sort of natural phenomenon that will just emerge and become dangerous. *WE* design it and *WE* build it,"" he said in a post on X.LeCun drew parallels of the AI technology's development with turbojets.""I can imagine thousands of scenarios where a turbojet goes terribly wrong. Yet we managed to make turbojets insanely reliable before deploying them widely,"" he said.In a separate post, he said that the ""fact that a $30 gadget can beat you at chess doesn't mean it is smarter than you.""Previously, LeCun rejected claims by Elon Musk that Ai “will probably be smarter than any single human next year.”“No. If it were the case, we would have AI systems that could teach themselves to drive a car in 20 hours of practice, like any 17 year-old,” LeCun said on X.","Yann LeCun, Meta's chief AI scientist, says AI is not a natural phenomenon that will become dangerous to humans.

Apple loses bid to block antitrust lawsuit over App Store prices,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-loses-bid-to-block-antitrust-lawsuit-over-app-store-prices/articleshow/110507678.cms,"Why Apple says that the lawsuit needs to be thrown out

Apple's attempt to block a class-action lawsuit accusing the company of monopolizing the iPhone app market has been denied by the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals . This lawsuit, filed in 2011, alleges Apple violated antitrust laws by restricting how users download apps and potentially inflating prices for tens of millions of customers.The lawsuit, certified in February by U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers, allows consumers who spent $10 or more on the App Store since 2008 to join the case and potentially seek billions in damages.Apple argued against the certification, claiming it unfairly includes at least 10 million App Store accounts without sufficient evidence of harm. However, the appeals court denied Apple's request for a pretrial appeal without a hearing, siding with lawyers for the plaintiffs who believe Judge Rogers' decision was fair.This ruling follows a similar class-action lawsuit against Google, which the 9th Circuit initially agreed to review before the trial judge reversed his decision to approve the class. Apple attempted to draw parallels between the two cases, but it was ultimately unsuccessful.The plaintiffs have expressed frustration with delays caused by what they call Apple's ""scorched-earth"" litigation tactics. Both parties have suggested a possible trial date sometime in 2026.It's important to note that this lawsuit is separate from the one filed by the U.S. Department of Justice in March, which accuses Apple of monopolizing the entire smartphone market. Apple has denied all allegations and plans to fight both lawsuits.",Apple's attempt to block a class-action lawsuit has been denied by the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals.

A parent of a class 9 student enrolled in a prestigious CBSE school in the city has taken a significant step by filing a complaint with the police cyber cell. The complaint alleges the circulation of artificial intelligence (AI)-generated nude photos of her daughter on various social media platforms. Concurrently, another student from the same class had their images morphed, although no formal complaint has been lodged on their behalf.The photos first surfaced within a group chat on Instagram, which included approximately 20 classmates of the affected student. Although the student herself was not part of this particular group, she was alerted to the distressing situation by her peers.The affected student, in contemplating the origins of this violation, suspects the involvement of an acquaintance, given that the images were sourced from her private Instagram account. She perceives this as a potential ""inside job,"" with a friend possibly responsible for the reprehensible act.An anonymous Instagram handle served as the conduit for disseminating the manipulated photos. However, when queried about their identity by other students, the account holder promptly went offline, abstaining from further activity.In response to these distressing events, the affected student expressed relief that a formal complaint has been filed, anticipating tangible consequences. Meanwhile, the school administration has assured its full support, characterising the incident as a disciplinary matter. The principal reiterated the importance of appropriate action, particularly considering the school's closure for vacation.Dr. Manoj Sharma, a distinguished professor at Nimhans specialising in clinical psychology and head of the SHUT clinic, emphasised the under-reported nature of such incidents. He advised caution regarding personal information sharing, stressing the inherent risks even when exercising vigilance on social media platforms.",A parent of a class 9 student enrolled in a prestigious CBSE school in Bengaluru has filed a complaint with the police cyber cell.

Pro models may get a new Rose colour

Apple

may rename existing colours

Apple iPhone 16 series launch is months away. But the rumour mill is buzzing with expected features, design and now colour of the 2024 iPhone lineup. Popular Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo says that the Cupertino-based company may add two new colours to the iPhone 16, replacing the existing ones.The information was shared by Kuo in a post on X, formerly Twitter .In the post, Kuo says that the Pro models - iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max could be offered in black, white or silver, gray or ""Natural Titanium,"" and an all-new rose. The existing iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max are offered in Black Titanium, White Titanium, Blue Titanium and Natural Titanium colours.Kuo reveals that the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus are expected to come in black, green, pink, blue and white colour variants. Apple may also rename previous colours as well, Kuo adds. For example, the existing white could be renamed to starlight. “Also, even if the colour name is the same as the existing model, it may look different”, he says.Earlier, Kuo said that the iPhone 16 Pro Max is expected to feature a new battery with better energy density, potentially enhancing battery life if Apple maintains the same battery size. According to Kuo, iPhone 16 Pro Max will reportedly see a substantial redesign of its battery, switching from an aluminium to a stainless steel casing. This shift not only increases the battery's energy density but also improves its structural integrity. While stainless steel is less effective at dissipating heat compared to aluminium, it offers stronger protection, which could be beneficial for the overall durability of the device.In a related news, display analyst Ross Young said that the display production for Apple iPhone 16 will begin next month. This is on schedule with the timing of last year’s iPhone 15 production and the 2024 iPhone series launch may follow the same timeline as last year.","Apple may add two new colours to the iPhone 16, replacing the existing ones.

In a bold move at the Cannes Film Festival, Polish director Patryk Vega unveiled his latest project, a biopic titled ""Putin,"" featuring an AI-generated deepfake of Russian President Vladimir Putin . The film, which has already been sold in 50 countries ahead of its September premiere, uses advanced artificial intelligence to replicate Putin's face on a real actor’s body.Vega, known for his popular Polish films, decided to use AI technology to create a more authentic portrayal of Putin.""To come extremely close to the dictator, we needed Putin, not an actor with make-up,"" Vega explained. The film’s trailer opens with a striking scene of the Russian leader cowering on the floor in diapers, setting the tone for its controversial narrative.As per an ET report, Vega humorously recounted his approach: ""I called Putin and asked him if he wanted to play in my movie... No, that was a joke."" Despite the jest, the director utilised AI to generate Putin's face due to the lack of sufficient high-resolution images for a full-body deepfake. The results, according to early viewers, are uncannily realistic.""Putin"" chronicles the life of the Russian president over six decades, starting from his childhood at age 10, where he is depicted being beaten by his stepfather. The film culminates in a fictional portrayal of his death, which Vega describes as ""a happy end.""The concept for the biopic emerged during the early days of Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Initially, Vega aimed to make a film about the Russian mafia but shifted focus to what he considered ""the biggest gangster.""Despite potential risks, Vega dismisses fears of reprisals, boldly stating, ""Putin should be afraid of me."" The director's venture into AI has broader implications for the film industry, particularly in Hollywood, where the technology is both a boon and a source of concern. AI advancements threaten traditional roles, especially among special effects technicians and extras, raising fears of job losses.These concerns were central to last year's strike by actors and writers, culminating in an agreement that included compensation for the use of AI-generated likenesses. Despite apprehensions, AI is already extensively used in the industry. For example, it was employed to de-age Harrison Ford in the latest ""Indiana Jones"" film, though studios often refrain from publicising these uses.Beyond film production, AI's applications are expanding in various sectors of the media. The Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media, for instance, uses algorithms to analyse screenplays for gender and diversity biases. YouTube, a significant player in film promotion and distribution, has leveraged AI for over a decade, employing it for automated subtitles and copyright protections.Since April, YouTube has begun labelling AI-generated content and enhancing its detection programs. Justine Ryst, head of YouTube France, emphasised that ""AI isn't going to take over creation. It's going to simplify the complex, and make possible the impossible."" She advocated for a balance between innovation and responsibility in utilising AI.","Polish director Patryk Vega unveiled his latest project, a biopic titled ""Putin,"" featuring an AI-generated deepfake of Russian President Vladimir Putin.

The label uses stars to indicate the efficiency of a product, with more stars indicating higher efficiency. Simply put, the higher the energy efficiency rating of the appliance, the lower its energy consumption. To effectively reduce your home's energy costs, opt for appliances with a 5-star BEE rating. Not only does this positively impact the environment, but it also helps lower your electricity bills.

LED bulbs are not just a trendy choice; they are recognized for their energy efficiency and superior illumination. If you're wondering how to reduce your electricity bill at home, switching to LED bulbs is the solution for you.Upgrading to smart appliances is a highly effective method to decrease electricity consumption at home. These devices allow you to automate tasks and manage energy usage efficiently. Consider installing energy-efficient ceiling fans to further reduce electricity consumption. Smart appliances typically come equipped with remote control capabilities, allowing you to schedule operations and conserve power. Crompton offers remote-controlled fans designed for enhanced energy savings and lower power consumption.These energy-efficient fans are gaining popularity due to their brushless direct current motors (BLDC), which operate on direct current electricity. They can help save up to 60% on electricity compared to normal induction motor-based fans. Additionally, they offer convenient features like remote control for turning the fan on and off, timer functionality, and compatibility with voice assistants.

However, there are more accessible and cost-effective ways to leverage solar energy. Installing outdoor solar lights in your balcony and garden, along with solar fans, can notably reduce your energy expenses at a modest cost. Additionally, using solar pumps for daily tasks can contribute to electricity savings. It's beneficial to understand the distinction between an electric geyser and a solar geyser to make an informed choice for your energy needs.Maintain your air conditioner at 24 degrees Celsius to optimise cooling and conserve energy during the summer months, effectively lowering electricity costs. Additionally, using a timer to automate AC operation and upgrading to a 5-star BEE-rated model can further enhance energy efficiency and reduce expenses associated with cooling your space.Numerous advanced smart energy metres are currently offered in the market. These metres typically use Wi-Fi connectivity to monitor overall power usage within a home and provide real-time analysis of consumption patterns. Additionally, they can detect power leaks and identify high-energy-consuming appliances. Wi-Fi LED bulbs represent an excellent choice for reducing electricity usage.Regularly servicing and maintaining your home appliances is essential for optimal functionality and efficiency. Appliances that are not properly maintained are known to consume excessive energy, so routine maintenance can prolong their lifespan and reduce energy consumption. Learn more about the importance of cleaning exhaust fans.Install a power strip if you have several electronic devices or appliances that need to be plugged into a single electrical outlet. This allows you to easily turn off all devices at once when they are not in use, preventing unnecessary energy consumption often referred to as ""phantom"" energy loss.One of the simplest and most effective methods to lower electricity costs is by turning off electrical devices such as lights, fans, and air conditioners when they are not in use.","During summer months, many households experience a significant increase in electricity consumption due to higher cooling needs.

Watch: Sam Altman shares how he spent the 4-and-a-half days he was sacked as ChatGPT maker OpenAI CEO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/watch-sam-altman-shares-how-he-spent-the-four-and-a-half-days-he-was-sacked-as-chatgpt-maker-openai-ceo/articleshow/110203159.cms,"Sam Altman talks GPT-4o and Predicts the Future of AI

The big lesson learnt

Sam Altman , CEO of OpenAI , has been on a rollercoaster the last few years. Since the company's release of ChatGPT, he's widely regarded as the poster boy of Generative-AI world. He's met with world leaders, clashed with Elon Musk , and even joined the billionaire club. Amidst all this, he also got fired (briefly) from the company he co-founded.On a recent tech podcast ""The Logan Bartlett Show"", Altman said with a laugh that if he had more time to reflect, ""every day would have something crazy."" However, one truly surreal moment stands out: His four-day ousting from OpenAI.As reported by Business Insider, it wasn't the firing itself that was unreal. It was how he handled this bizarre situation. Altman described it as an ""insane, superjammed"" 4 ½ days where his body was in an ""adrenaline-charged state.""Within a day of being fired, world leaders started texting. He received messages from 10-20 presidents and prime ministers. He said it felt normal at the time, and he even thanked them without batting an eye.""It was just weird,"" Altman admitted. He barely slept or ate, but his focus and energy were off the charts.Once he got his job back, reality hit him. Stopping at a diner, he realized he hadn't eaten in days. Naturally, he celebrated with a feast: four ""heavy"" meals and two milkshakes (just for him!).The celebratory meal was great, but the real shocker came later. A president texted him, relieved things were settled.Suddenly, Altman realized how bizarre it all was. World leaders texting him during his firing shouldn't have felt normal, but it did. It showed him just how adaptable humans are.""We can get used to anything as the new normal, good or bad, pretty fast,"" Altman said. He sees this as a strength – humans can adapt to almost anything.""My takeaway is human adaptability to almost anything is just, like, much more remarkably strong than we realize,"" Altman said on the podcast. ""And you can get used to anything as the new normal, good or bad, pretty fast.""","Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, has been on a rollercoaster the last few years.
