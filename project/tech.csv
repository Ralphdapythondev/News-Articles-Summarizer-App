"After OpenAI, Facebook-parent Meta may strike paid deals with news publishers for training AI models",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/after-openai-facebook-parent-meta-may-strike-paid-deals-with-news-publishers-for-training-ai-models/articleshow/110445021.cms,"How Meta trains its Llama AI models

OpenAI strikes deal with News Corp

Facebook-parent Meta is reportedly considering paying news organisations to better train its AI language models as it looks to make its generative AI tools, including Meta AI , more effective and competitive in the market of generative AI search tools as well as chatbots offered by Google and Microsoft .Citing two people familiar with the considerations, a report by Business Insider said that teams within the company are discussing internally whether to strike deals with news publishers for more access to news, photo, and video content.“Meta may be forced to pay someone,” said one of the sources.Meta, however, has not yet approached any news outlets about licensing content, and internal talks are ongoing. Any deals for data access for model training would be separate from past agreements where Meta paid publishers to host links on its sites.Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has claimed that his company has its own data for training its Llama models that is larger than Common Crawl, a massive set of scraped web data used widely (including by Meta) for AI model training.However, there are concerns internally about the quality of that owned data, one of the people familiar said. For example, compared to books, news articles and essays, posts and comments on Facebook or Instagram are not necessarily the type of high-quality training data that generative AI chatbots and search tools need to generate quality outputs.OpenAI, the company behind the AI chatbot ChatGPT, recently signed a multi-year deal with media giant News Corp, which owns outlets such as The Wall Street Journal, MarketWatch, and The Sun.Under the deal, reportedly worth $250 million over five years, OpenAI will be allowed to access the content from over a dozen news publishers to train its AI models .","Facebook-parent Meta is reportedly considering paying news organisations to better train its AI language models.

According to a report in Bloomberg, ""Asia’s richest man Mukesh Ambani is set to enter Africa with a telecoms venture, seeking to win mobile broadband customers in a high-growth market. Radisys Corp, a unit of Ambani-controlled Reliance Industries Ltd, will provide key network infrastructure, applications and smartphones for Ghana-based Next-Gen InfraCo, according to Harkirit Singh, the executive director of NGIC .""Singh reportedly described the plans ahead of NGIC’s launch announcement in Mumbai later toady (May 27).NGIC, launching later this year, will offer 5G infrastructure to other operators and internet providers in Ghana. The company focuses on ""affordable digital services in emerging markets"" and boasts a strong team. This includes Reliance subsidiary Radisys Corp. providing network equipment, applications, and devices, alongside tech giants Nokia, Microsoft, and Indian outsourcer Tech Mahindra.Ghana, a West African country with a population of just over 33 million, has three main operators: MTN Ghana, Vodafone Ghana and state-run AirtelTigo. NGIC’s strategic partners, its technological prowess and the company’s possession of Ghana’s only 5G license will help it build broadband services at scale, a huge expense for individual mobile carriers, Singh told Bloomberg.The venture is modeled after the success of Ambani's Jio Infocomm in India. Jio revolutionized the Indian mobile market with low-cost data and free voice calls, making mobile data accessible for millions. NGIC hopes to replicate this success in Ghana, offering affordable mobile broadband and devices.This partnership also holds diplomatic significance for India, seen as a counter to China's growing influence in Africa through digital initiatives.While Reliance and other strategic partners currently don't own any shares in NGIC, they have the option to convert future payments into equity. Singh, NGIC's executive director, emphasized proving their value before bringing partners on board.","Next-Gen InfraCo will offer 5G infrastructure to other operators and internet providers in Ghana.

Discussion on artificial intelligence

Importance of truthfulness in AI

Elon Musk's stance on aliens

Also read

During a recent appearance at the Viva Tech event in Paris, Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk made a humorous claim that he is an alien, though he noted that no one takes him seriously. Speaking remotely via webcam, Musk also discussed various topics including artificial intelligence and its impact on future employment.When the event host mentioned that some people believe Musk is an alien, he laughed and responded, ""I am an alien."" The host further jested, ""Now you've been uncovered,"" to which Musk replied, ""Yeah, I keep saying I'm an alien, but nobody believes me."" This light-hearted exchange highlighted Musk's playful nature during the event.The conversation then shifted to more serious topics, particularly artificial intelligence (AI). Musk predicted that AI would eventually eliminate all jobs, but he argued that this might not be a negative development. ""Probably none of us will have a job,"" he said, envisioning a future where jobs would be optional. He elaborated, ""I do think that long term, in a benign scenario, any job that somebody does will be optional. If you want to do a job as a kind of hobby, you can, but otherwise AI and robots will provide any goods and services that you want.""Musk emphasised the need for AI to be trained to be truthful rather than politically correct. He stated, ""I think it's very important that AI be trained to be truthful and not trained to be politically correct. Because if political correctness is often simply not true, and that means you're programming as a lie. I think that will backfire very badly."" Musk expressed his concern that regulators might not make the right decisions and could focus too much on human errors. He urged regulators to prioritise the accuracy and truthfulness of AI.Despite the humour, Musk touched on the serious topic of extraterrestrial life, saying, ""If I ever saw proof of aliens, I'd promptly share it on the X platform."" This statement reflects his openness to the idea of alien life and his commitment to transparency.","Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk made a humorous claim that he is an alien, though he noted that no one takes him seriously.

The government has directed telecom operators -- Reliance Jio , Airtel , Vodafone-Idea and BSNL -- to block all incoming international spoofed calls that display Indian mobile numbers, an official statement said.In an advisory issued, the Department of Telecom ( DoT ) said that it has been reported that fraudsters are making international spoofed calls displaying Indian mobile numbers to Indian citizens and committing cyber-crime and financial frauds.According to DoT, such calls appear to be originating within India but are being made by cybercriminals from abroad by manipulating the calling line identity (CLI) and have been misused in recent cases of fake digital arrests, FedEx scams, drugs or narcotics in courier, impersonation as government and police officials, disconnections of mobile numbers by DoT or TRAI officials, etc.""DoT and Telecom Service Providers (TSPs) have devised a system to identify and block such international spoofed calls from reaching any Indian telecom subscriber.

For such calls, you can help everybody by reporting such suspected fraud communications at the Chakshu facility on Sanchar Saathi ,"" the statement said.Last week, the DoT issued directives to the telecom operators to carry out immediate re-verification of 6.8 lakh mobile numbers within 60 days that are suspected to have been obtained using invalid, non-existent, or fake documents.The telecom department is said to have flagged around 6.80 lakh mobile connections as potentially fraudulent after advanced AI-driven analysis.","Reliance Jio, Airtel, Vodafone-Idea and BSNL have been told to block all incoming international spoofed calls that display Indian mobile numbers.

“Our industries have serious concerns that currently considered solutions and requirements for implementing the DMA could further increase discrimination. Initial observations indicate that these changes risk severely depleting

direct sales revenues

of companies by giving more prominence to powerful

online intermediaries

due to the preferential treatment they would receive. We are concerned that the non-compliance investigation refers only to the need to treat third-party services in a fair and non-discriminatory manner, without any acknowledgement of

European businesses

that also offer their services on Google.”

Lobbying groups representing airlines, hotels and retailers in Europe are worried about the changes that Google is expected to bring forward to its Search platform to comply with the European Union’s (EU) latest tech rules.According to a report by the news agency Reuters, these groups have urged tech regulators of the EU to ensure that the US-based search giant takes their views into account and not just large intermediaries while making the changes in its Search platform.In March, the Airlines for Europe group which includes Air France KLM and British Airways owner IAG as well as hotel group Hotrec, European Hotel Forum, EuroCommerce, Ecommerce Europe and Independent Retail Europe as members, has expressed their concerns about the impact of the new rules that Google may announce to comply with EU's Digital Markets Act ( DMA ).This new regulation imposes a list of dos and don'ts on Google and five other tech giants to give users more choices and rivals a better chance to compete. However, the groups are concerned that these changes may hurt their revenues.In a joint letter to EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager and EU industry chief Thierry Breton (seen by Reuters), the Airlines for Europe group shared that their worries have increased since the announcement.The group wrote:In March, a Google blog post said changes to search results give large intermediaries and aggregators more traffic and less for hotels, airlines, merchants and restaurants.

The AI PC era is here with Microsoft Copilot+ PCs with Windows 11. Alongside the new ARM-based PCs, Microsoft has announced a host of new AI-powered features that require at least 40 TOPs of AI performance to run.Here we’ve explained all the new AI-powered features that Microsoft has announced as a part of the entire Copilot+ PC with Windows 11.Windows 10 debuted with a feature called Timeline.The feature was aimed at keeping a record of everything that users have done on their PC in last couple of days. From accessing a file to websites, apps, software and whatnot. However, Microsoft nuked the feature only to bring it back as “Recall” with the power of AI that does everything Timeline used to do, but better and more efficiently.Recall is a powerful feature designed to help you find and revisit anything users have seen or done on their PC. It acts like a photographic memory, capturing and organising your digital activities so you can easily locate information without remembering exact file locations or details.Recall continuously records your screen, capturing snapshots of your activities across all applications, websites, documents, and more. It builds a personal semantic index based on your interactions, which is stored locally on your device to ensure privacy. You can interact with Recall using natural language, and it will search through your recorded data to find what you need.Cocreator allows users to combine ink strokes with text prompts to generate images in real-time. Leveraging Neural Processing Units (NPUs) and local language models, it iterates on the artwork, providing high-quality outputs with powerful diffusion-based algorithms. Users can adjust the creativity slider to range from literal to expressive styles and continue refining their artwork effortlessly.This new AI feature makes photo editing easier and simpler for users by allowing them to apply preset styles such as Cyberpunk or Claymation to their photos. Users can transform backgrounds, foregrounds, or entire images and get visual inspiration for their creative projects. On Copilot+ PCs, users can generate, fine-tune, and save endless images quickly.Microsoft has announced DaVinci Resolve Studio now features NPU-accelerated Magic Mask for applying visual effects, while CapCut uses Auto Cutout for instant video background removal. These enhancements streamline video editing and content creation processes.Cephable introduces faster adaptive input controls using head movements or facial expressions, thanks to NPU-powered camera pipelines. LiquidText provides smarter on-device AI annotations, ensuring data privacy by keeping processing local.This feature translates any audio passing through a PC into English subtitles in real-time, supporting over 40 languages and working offline. It's available across all Copilot+ PCs, ensuring accessibility and understanding in global communications.Microsoft has announced new and improved features including Portrait Light for better illumination, creative filters like illustrated and watercolour, Eye Contact Teleprompter, and enhancements to voice focus and portrait blur, all aimed at improving video call quality.Every Copilot+ PC includes Copilot, an advanced AI agent that offers natural voice conversations using the latest AI models, including GPT-4o. This personal AI assistant is designed for ease of use, with a dedicated Copilot key on keyboards for quick access.","Recall is a powerful feature designed to help you find and revisit anything users have seen or done on their PC.

Google has unveiled a significant battery life improvement in the upcoming Android 15 update . By optimizing the Doze mode feature, standby times are set to see a jump of up to three hours on compatible devices.Doze mode automatically puts unused apps and processes to sleep when the phone remains idle. This update focuses on speeding up the activation of Doze mode.According to Google's internal testing, this translates to Android 15 devices entering Doze mode 50% faster compared to Android 14.The faster Doze mode activation has a direct impact on battery life. Google claims users can expect up to three additional hours of standby time on certain devices. This translates to a significant boost, especially for users who don't use their phones constantly but still experience battery drain throughout the day.The improved Doze mode is expected to be a general feature across all devices receiving the Android 15 update. While the exact improvement in standby time might vary depending on individual phone models and usage patterns, it signifies a positive step towards better battery management for the entire Android ecosystem.The focus on battery optimization extends beyond smartphones. Google hinted that the next iteration of their smartwatch platform, Wear OS 6, will also benefit from the faster Doze mode functionality. This could lead to improved battery life for smartwatches as well.","Google has unveiled a significant battery life improvement in the upcoming Android 15 update.

Apple may bring iPhone 16 series in two new colours: Details,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/mobiles-tabs/apple-may-bring-iphone-16-series-in-two-new-colours-details/articleshow/110260524.cms,"

Pro models may get a new Rose colour

Apple

may rename existing colours

Apple iPhone 16 series launch is months away. But the rumour mill is buzzing with expected features, design and now colour of the 2024 iPhone lineup. Popular Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo says that the Cupertino-based company may add two new colours to the iPhone 16, replacing the existing ones.The information was shared by Kuo in a post on X, formerly Twitter .In the post, Kuo says that the Pro models - iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max could be offered in black, white or silver, gray or ""Natural Titanium,"" and an all-new rose. The existing iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max are offered in Black Titanium, White Titanium, Blue Titanium and Natural Titanium colours.Kuo reveals that the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus are expected to come in black, green, pink, blue and white colour variants. Apple may also rename previous colours as well, Kuo adds. For example, the existing white could be renamed to starlight. “Also, even if the colour name is the same as the existing model, it may look different”, he says.Earlier, Kuo said that the iPhone 16 Pro Max is expected to feature a new battery with better energy density, potentially enhancing battery life if Apple maintains the same battery size. According to Kuo, iPhone 16 Pro Max will reportedly see a substantial redesign of its battery, switching from an aluminium to a stainless steel casing. This shift not only increases the battery's energy density but also improves its structural integrity. While stainless steel is less effective at dissipating heat compared to aluminium, it offers stronger protection, which could be beneficial for the overall durability of the device.In a related news, display analyst Ross Young said that the display production for Apple iPhone 16 will begin next month. This is on schedule with the timing of last year’s iPhone 15 production and the 2024 iPhone series launch may follow the same timeline as last year.","Apple may add two new colours to the iPhone 16, replacing the existing ones.

Hinton is against the use of AI technology in the military



Geoffrey Hinton , the software engineer who is often regarded as the “godfather of artificial intelligence” has said that he is “very worried” about the artificial intelligence technology “taking lots of mundane jobs”. He said that it will be on to the governments to deal with the impact of artificial intelligence ( AI ) on income inequality.Hinton, who worked at Google until last year, said that while AI will increase productivity and wealth, the money would go to the rich “and not the people whose jobs get lost and that’s going to be very bad for society”.He noted that the government will have to establish a universal basic income , which means that the government will have to pay all individuals a set basic salary regardless of their means.“I was consulted by people in Downing Street and I advised them that universal basic income was a good idea,” Hinton, who left Google to talk more freely about the dangers of unregulated AI, told BBC.Hinton previously said that some of the dangers of AI chatbots were “quite scary”. He is of the view that AI chatbots can become more intelligent than humans and may be exploited by “bad actors”.AI could “evolve to get the motivation to make more of itself” and can autonomously “develop a sub-goal of getting control”, pointing out evidence of large language models choosing to be deceptive.""My guess is in between five and 20 years from now there’s a probability of half that we’ll have to confront the problem of AI trying to take over,” he said.As per Hinton, this will lead to an “extinction-level threat” for humans because they may have “created a form of intelligence that is just better than biological intelligence… That's very worrying for us”.“What I’m most concerned about is when these can autonomously make the decision to kill people,"" he added.","Geoffrey Hinton, the ‘godfather of artificial intelligence’ has said that he is ‘very worried’ about the artificial intelligence technology “taking lots of mundane jobs’ Hinton said that while AI will increase productivity and wealth, the money would go to the rich “and not the people whose jobs get lost”","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110254760,imgsize-126994,width-400,resizemode-4/110254760.jpg"

Phone condition: Assess the physical condition of the phone. Look for scratches, dents, or other signs of wear. Check the screen for cracks and ensure all buttons and ports function correctly.

Age of the phone: Determine how old the mobile is and consider its release date. Older models may lack software updates and compatibility with newer apps.

Battery health: Battery life is crucial for a smooth user experience. Inquire about the battery health and ask for details on its capacity and degradation over time.

Software updates: Ensure the phone is compatible with the latest software updates from the manufacturer. Older devices may not receive updates, which can impact security and functionality.

Network compatibility: Confirm that the mobile phone is unlocked or compatible with your network carrier. Some phones are locked to specific carriers, limiting your options.

IMEI check: Verify the phone's IMEI number to ensure it's not stolen or blacklisted. This step helps prevent buying a phone with legal issues or unpaid bills.

Performance testing: Test the phone's performance by running apps, browsing the internet, and checking the camera quality. Look for lagging or freezing issues.

Storage capacity: Determine the phone's storage capacity and assess whether it meets your needs for storing photos, videos, and apps.

Price comparison: Research the market value of the phone model you're interested in. Compare prices from different sellers to ensure you're getting a fair deal.

Seller reputation: Buy from reputable sellers with positive reviews or ratings. Avoid transactions with unknown individuals or suspicious online platforms.

In a bold move at the Cannes Film Festival, Polish director Patryk Vega unveiled his latest project, a biopic titled ""Putin,"" featuring an AI-generated deepfake of Russian President Vladimir Putin . The film, which has already been sold in 50 countries ahead of its September premiere, uses advanced artificial intelligence to replicate Putin's face on a real actor’s body.Vega, known for his popular Polish films, decided to use AI technology to create a more authentic portrayal of Putin.""To come extremely close to the dictator, we needed Putin, not an actor with make-up,"" Vega explained. The film’s trailer opens with a striking scene of the Russian leader cowering on the floor in diapers, setting the tone for its controversial narrative.As per an ET report, Vega humorously recounted his approach: ""I called Putin and asked him if he wanted to play in my movie... No, that was a joke."" Despite the jest, the director utilised AI to generate Putin's face due to the lack of sufficient high-resolution images for a full-body deepfake. The results, according to early viewers, are uncannily realistic.""Putin"" chronicles the life of the Russian president over six decades, starting from his childhood at age 10, where he is depicted being beaten by his stepfather. The film culminates in a fictional portrayal of his death, which Vega describes as ""a happy end.""The concept for the biopic emerged during the early days of Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Initially, Vega aimed to make a film about the Russian mafia but shifted focus to what he considered ""the biggest gangster.""Despite potential risks, Vega dismisses fears of reprisals, boldly stating, ""Putin should be afraid of me."" The director's venture into AI has broader implications for the film industry, particularly in Hollywood, where the technology is both a boon and a source of concern. AI advancements threaten traditional roles, especially among special effects technicians and extras, raising fears of job losses.These concerns were central to last year's strike by actors and writers, culminating in an agreement that included compensation for the use of AI-generated likenesses. Despite apprehensions, AI is already extensively used in the industry. For example, it was employed to de-age Harrison Ford in the latest ""Indiana Jones"" film, though studios often refrain from publicising these uses.Beyond film production, AI's applications are expanding in various sectors of the media. The Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media, for instance, uses algorithms to analyse screenplays for gender and diversity biases. YouTube, a significant player in film promotion and distribution, has leveraged AI for over a decade, employing it for automated subtitles and copyright protections.Since April, YouTube has begun labelling AI-generated content and enhancing its detection programs. Justine Ryst, head of YouTube France, emphasised that ""AI isn't going to take over creation. It's going to simplify the complex, and make possible the impossible."" She advocated for a balance between innovation and responsibility in utilising AI.","Polish director Patryk Vega unveiled his latest project, a biopic titled ""Putin,"" featuring an AI-generated deepfake of Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Watch: Sam Altman shares how he spent the 4-and-a-half days he was sacked as ChatGPT maker OpenAI CEO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/watch-sam-altman-shares-how-he-spent-the-four-and-a-half-days-he-was-sacked-as-chatgpt-maker-openai-ceo/articleshow/110203159.cms,"Sam Altman talks GPT-4o and Predicts the Future of AI

The big lesson learnt

Sam Altman , CEO of OpenAI , has been on a rollercoaster the last few years. Since the company's release of ChatGPT, he's widely regarded as the poster boy of Generative-AI world. He's met with world leaders, clashed with Elon Musk , and even joined the billionaire club. Amidst all this, he also got fired (briefly) from the company he co-founded.On a recent tech podcast ""The Logan Bartlett Show"", Altman said with a laugh that if he had more time to reflect, ""every day would have something crazy."" However, one truly surreal moment stands out: His four-day ousting from OpenAI.As reported by Business Insider, it wasn't the firing itself that was unreal. It was how he handled this bizarre situation. Altman described it as an ""insane, superjammed"" 4 ½ days where his body was in an ""adrenaline-charged state.""Within a day of being fired, world leaders started texting. He received messages from 10-20 presidents and prime ministers. He said it felt normal at the time, and he even thanked them without batting an eye.""It was just weird,"" Altman admitted. He barely slept or ate, but his focus and energy were off the charts.Once he got his job back, reality hit him. Stopping at a diner, he realized he hadn't eaten in days. Naturally, he celebrated with a feast: four ""heavy"" meals and two milkshakes (just for him!).The celebratory meal was great, but the real shocker came later. A president texted him, relieved things were settled.Suddenly, Altman realized how bizarre it all was. World leaders texting him during his firing shouldn't have felt normal, but it did. It showed him just how adaptable humans are.""We can get used to anything as the new normal, good or bad, pretty fast,"" Altman said. He sees this as a strength – humans can adapt to almost anything.""My takeaway is human adaptability to almost anything is just, like, much more remarkably strong than we realize,"" Altman said on the podcast. ""And you can get used to anything as the new normal, good or bad, pretty fast.""","Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, has been on a rollercoaster the last few years.
