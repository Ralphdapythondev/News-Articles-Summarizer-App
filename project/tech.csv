Why US court wants TikTok to face lawsuit over 10-year-old girl's death,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-us-court-wants-tiktok-to-face-lawsuit-over-10-year-old-girls-death/articleshow/112881051.cms,"A US appeals court has revived a lawsuit against TikTok, holding the social media platform responsible for recommending a dangerous ""Blackout Challenge"" to a 10-year-old girl who tragically died after attempting it.The lawsuit, filed by the mother of Nylah Anderson, alleges that TikTok's algorithm played a pivotal role in suggesting the challenge to her daughter.While internet companies typically enjoy legal protection from liability for user-generated content, the court ruled that this protection doesn't extend to algorithmic recommendations.The court's decision marks a significant departure from previous rulings, which had generally shielded online platforms from liability for failing to prevent users from sharing harmful content. However, a recent Supreme Court ruling on social media platforms' content moderation practices influenced this new interpretation.The court found that TikTok's algorithm reflects the company's editorial judgments and therefore constitutes its own speech, which is not protected by the existing legal shield. This means the platform can be held accountable for the content it recommends to users.TikTok has yet to respond to the court's decision. The case now heads back to a lower court for further proceedings.The lawsuit's outcome could have far-reaching implications for social media platforms, potentially forcing them to take greater responsibility for the content they recommend to users. It also highlights the urgent need for stronger safeguards to protect young people from online dangers.","A US appeals court has revived a lawsuit against TikTok.

Telegram CEO

Pavel Durov , the founder and CEO of the popular messaging app Telegram, is reportedly facing a new investigation in France. In addition to the ongoing probe into his alleged failure to curb illegal content on Telegram app, French authorities are now investigating him on suspicion of ""serious acts of violence"" against his seven-year-old son.The child welfare office in France launched the investigation into Durov's son, who was born in 2017 and is currently living in Switzerland.The investigation reportedly began recently. If found guilty of the child abuse allegations , Durov could face serious legal consequences. If charges are pressed, a judge will decide whether to impose restrictions on his movements or require him to post a bond.Durov was arrested last week in France and detained for four days. He was released on Wednesday after being questioned by French prosecutors. The initial investigation, which involves 12 alleged criminal violations, is ongoing.“An investigating judge has ended Pavel Durov’s police custody and will have him brought to court for a first appearance and a possible indictment,” a statement from the Paris prosecutor’s office said.According to reports, Durov is being brought in front of an investigative judge at the Paris judicial court in the north of the capital, according to a justice ministry official. The judge is expected to subject Telegram CEO to more questioning before deciding whether to press charges against him or name him as a material witness in the investigation and let him go free.If charges are pressed, another judge known as the juge des libertés will likely have to rule on whether any limits should be placed on his movements or if Durov should post a bond. The entire process is expected to take place behind closed doors.","Telegram CEO Pavel Durov is reportedly facing a new investigation in France.

Google brings back this Gemini AI photo-generation feature after months-long pause,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-brings-back-this-gemini-ai-photo-generation-feature-after-months-long-pause/articleshow/112874552.cms,"What are the changes coming to Google image generation AI model

Imagen 3 availability

Google has announced that it has updated Gemini 's AI image-creation model and will soon reintroduce the capability to generate images of people. The company paused the image generation capabilities of its AI chatbot in February after it generated inaccurate photos related to some historical depictions.At that time, Google said that it will re-work the underlying model to enhance the product to mitigate inaccuracies.The AI model is now powered by Imagen 3 – the company’s “highest quality text-to-image model, capable of generating images with even better detail, richer lighting and fewer distracting artefacts than our previous models.”Google also says that the creative image generation capabilities have been upgraded.“With Imagen 3, we’ve made significant progress in providing a better user experience when generating images of people. We don’t support the generation of photorealistic, identifiable individuals, depictions of minors or excessively gory, violent or sexual scenes,” the company added.Google also claims that apart from advanced image generation capabilities, Imagen 3 also gets built-in safeguards and adheres to the company product design principles.“Across a wide range of benchmarks, Imagen 3 performs favorably compared to other image generation models available. And as with Imagen 2, we use SynthID, our tool for watermarking AI-generated images,” it added.Over the coming days, Google will bring the advanced image generation model to Gemini Apps and expand its availability for users in all languages. An early access version will be provided to Gemini Advanced, Business and Enterprise users, starting in English with support for other languages coming later.The company also highlights that not every image Gemini creates will be perfect and it is working to fine-tune its models.","Google has updated Gemini's AI image-creation model and will soon reintroduce the capability to generate images of people.

Google fixes photo issue in its AI tool Gemini that CEO Sundar Pichai apologised for and said “completely unacceptable”,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-fixes-photo-issue-in-its-ai-tool-gemini-that-ceo-sundar-pichai-apologised-for-and-said-completely-unacceptable/articleshow/112875276.cms,"What's the big change

Google introduces new restrictions

Alphabet's Google has announced that it will reinstate its image generation feature for some users, following a suspension earlier this year due to concerns over inaccurate and harmful depictions. In February, Google faced criticism for its AI-powered image generation tool, which produced historically inaccurate and racially insensitive images when prompted to create depictions of people.The company swiftly paused the feature and vowed to address the issues.Google's Gemini chatbot was particularly problematic, generating images that often perpetuated stereotypes or depicted anachronistic scenes. For example, when asked to create a Roman legion, Gemini would frequently produce images of racially diverse soldiers, while depictions of Zulu warriors were often stereotypical.Following the backlash, Google CEO Sundar Pichai issued an apology and called the responses “completely unacceptable,” and the Mountain View, California-based company pledged to implement improvements. Six months later, Google is now ready to reintroduce image generation, albeit with added safeguards.Starting with English-language users who have subscribed to the Gemini Advanced product, Google will gradually roll out the feature. Businesses will also have access to the tool in the coming days.Dave Citron, a senior director at Google, explained that the company has made significant advancements in its image generation capabilities, particularly with the Imagen 3 model. To ensure responsible use, Google has implemented technical improvements, rigorous testing, and clear guidelines. While acknowledging that the system may not be perfect, Citron emphasized the company's commitment to continuous improvement and user feedback.Google has imposed restrictions on the type of images that can be generated, prohibiting photorealistic imagery, identifiable individuals, depictions of minors, and excessively harmful content. As the feature becomes more widely available, Google will continue to monitor usage and refine its safeguards.","Google's Gemini chatbot was particularly problematic, generating images that often perpetuated stereotypes or depicted anachronistic scenes.

Former Amazon VP: CEO of startup I worked with got me divorced,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/former-amazon-vp-ceo-of-startup-i-worked-with-got-me-divorced/articleshow/112792027.cms,"Read the complete post here

A CEO that I worked for seduced my wife in direct retaliation for my pushback on him at work. He won. I got divorced and left the company. When I say I truly understand how some executive teams can be political snake pits, I trust you will believe me. Learn from my pain - do the following:

1) When you have a good manager, lean in and take advantage of it.

2) Spot the snakes.

3) Do excellent work, even for nasty leaders.

4) Don’t confront the snakes directly

5) Don’t become a snake

1) When you have a good manager, lean in and take advantage of it.

While I “survived” bad bosses, most of my career progress came while working for good, honest, and helpful managers.

Hold on to these managers as much as you can. Help them grow and succeed so that you can stay together, and you can grow and succeed with them. See success as a partnership with the people you can trust.

Ultimately, the key to my career success was excelling when I had good managers and just surviving in the periods when I did not.

Also, notice I say take advantage of “it”, not “them”. Take advantage of and benefit from having a good manager.

Don’t become dishonest and take advantage of someone else for your benefit.

I recognized early on that my CEO in the divorce story was unethical and dishonest. My mistake was letting fear of a tough economy convince me to try to stay in the job and ""win"" by pushing back. It cost me far more than I ever thought it could.

Action: Do whatever you need to get to a good manager! Leave before the snake bites.

2) Spot the snakes.

Generally, it doesn’t take long to figure out who is a good person and who is only looking out for themselves.

There are so many ways to see through the dishonest people:

– See if their actions match their words

–Talk to others who have been there longer - they know!

– Investigate their pasts - talk to someone who used to work for them but is now safely away

A smooth talker may fool you in person, particularly if you give people the benefit of the doubt. Observing carefully and doing your research can help you not fall for the charm of someone you shouldn’t trust.

Being cautious is important, but there is a big difference between being watchful and skeptical and being cynical and untrusting. Extend some trust in case your leader is a good person, but do not make yourself fully vulnerable until you know.

With the CEO I talk about, I had ""spotted the snake"" - my mistake was staying too long and getting bitten.

3), 4), and 5)

I'm out of room here. To read about why you need to do excellent work for nasty execs, why you shouldn't confront them, and about not becoming a snake yourself, subscribe to our newsletter.

Readers- What is the most stunning display of unethical leadership you have seen from the “snake pit?”

A former Amazon vice president has claimed that a CEO he worked for seduced his wife, leading to the eventual breakdown of his marriage. In a lengthy post, Ethan Evans , a former Amazon vice president, shared his encounters with ""unethical leaders."" He described a particularly shocking incident where a CEO of a startup he worked with seduced his wife.""A CEO that I worked for seduced my wife in direct retaliation for my pushback on him at work. He won. I got divorced and left the company. When I say I truly understand how some executive teams can be political snake pits, I trust you will believe me,"" he said in the LinkedIn post.Evans emphasised the importance of honesty and integrity in the workplace, warning against dishonest behaviour for personal gain. ""Don’t become dishonest and take advantage of someone else for your benefit,"" he said.He also mentioned that that he recognised early on that his CEO in the divorce story was unethical and dishonest. However, his fear of economic hardship led him to stay in the job and try to ""win"" by pushing back. This ultimately cost him far more than he anticipated.

Telegram chief executive Pavel Durov was arrested at a Paris airport for offences related to his popular messaging app. Durov was detained at Le Bourget airport in Paris after arriving on a private jet. Telegram is an encrypted messaging app, ranked as one of the major social media platforms after Facebook, YouTube, WhatsApp, Instagram , TikTok and WeChat.Durov is accused of failing to take action to curb the criminal use of his platform. He faces investigation for allegedly allowing a wide range of crimes due to a lack of moderators on Telegram and lack of cooperation with police. A cybersecurity gendarmerie unit and France 's national anti-fraud police unit are leading the investigation.Encrypted messaging app Telegram allows groups of up to 200,000 members, which has led to accusations that it makes it easier for false information to spread virally. There are also accusations that the app is used to disseminate neo-Nazi, paedophilic, conspiratorial and terrorist content.

Durov, however, has not said whether he renounced his Russian citizenship.Telegram app is particularly influential in Russia, Ukraine and the republics of the former Soviet Union. Telegram has become a major source of unfiltered content from both sides of the Ukraine war. Ukrainian and Russian governments both use Telegram heavily. The platform has become what some analysts call 'a virtual battlefield' for the war, used heavily by Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and his officials, as well as the Russian government.Tesla CEO Elon Musk posted the hashtag #FreePavel on the X social media platform, formerly Twitter. He wrote in French, ""Liberte Liberte! Liberte?"" (Freedom Freedom! Freedom?).

“$ is not just a currency symbol. It is embedded in many programming language syntaxes such as:

- We write variables under this ${} in javascript.

- Variables are also written like this $1, $2 in bash syntax.”

“Only a person who works on MS Excel knows the answer. $ is used to freeze a Row or column in Excel formulas and ₹ can't do that. That's why $ is used universally for that purpose . However, you can anytime use ₹ on your computer.”

"Why TRAI's ‘September 1 deadline’ for Airtel, Reliance Jio and Vodafone-Idea is ‘bad news’ for your OTPs",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-trais-september-1-deadline-for-airtel-reliance-jio-and-vodafone-idea-is-bad-news-for-your-otps/articleshow/112787423.cms,"What is the big change

What is Whitelisting or URLs

Similar disruption in 2021

Starting September 1, consumers might experience disruptions in receiving service and transactional messages from banks, financial institutions, and e-commerce firms on their mobile phones. This follows a directive from the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) aimed at reducing spam, particularly phishing attempts.Trai has instructed telecom companies to stop transmitting messages containing URLs, OTT links, APKs (Android application packages), or call-back numbers that are not whitelisted—registered with telcos—by senders from September 1.This directive means that banks, financial institutions, and online platforms must register their message templates and content with operators by August 31. If they fail to do so, messages containing these elements will be blocked.Currently, entities register their headers and templates with telcos but not the content of messages. This means operators do not check the content of transmitted messages. However, starting next month, telcos must create a mechanism to read the content of commercial messages and block those that do not match their records, according to experts.In India, 1.5-1.7 billion commercial messages are sent daily, totaling about 55 billion every month, according to industry data.Airtel, Reliance Jio and Vodafone-Idea want extension in deadlineAccording to a report in Economic Times, industry executives say the telecom sector is seeking more time from Trai to implement the mandate as the blockchain-based distributed ledger technology (DLT) platform needs updating. However, the regulator believes it has given sufficient time to the telcos and is unwilling to extend the deadline, according to officials familiar with the matter.Bharti Airtel, Reliance Jio, and Vodafone Idea did not respond to ET’s queries.Whitelisting requires entities sending messages to provide all information related to URLs, call-back numbers, etc., to telcos, who will then feed the information into their DLT platform. If the information matches, the message is passed; otherwise, it is blocked.For example, most transactional messages from banks, such as funds debit or credit, contain a call-back number. Transmission of such messages will be stopped if a bank does not whitelist the number.“Only those entities, including banks, which whitelist their URLs or content of the messages with telcos, will pass through; the rest will be blocked,” said a telecom industry executive.Mobile consumers faced a similar outage in March 2021 when the DLT platform was implemented, and telcos started scrubbing messages. At that time, there was widespread disruption as telcos blocked all commercial messages that did not contain whitelisted headers and templates. Following the disruption, all entities have since registered their headers and templates with telcos.Experts say that in the current scenario, an increasing number of messages may shift to over-the-top (OTT) platforms like WhatsApp and Google’s rich communication services (RCS) messaging, as there is no such mandate from Trai to govern them. However, banking messages, where rules do not permit transmission over OTT, will be blocked if the entities have not been whitelisted, the experts added.","Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) has instructed telecom companies to stop transmitting messages containing URLs, OTT links, APKs, or call-back numbers that are not whitelisted by senders.

Google kills Fitbit smartwatches; says smartwatch portfolio now is ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-kills-fitbit-smartwatches-says-smartwatch-portfolio-now-is-/articleshow/112651343.cms,"Fitbit as a smartwatch brand is effectively over. No surprises, as many would say. The writing has been there on the wall for sometime now. Google acquired Fitbit in 2021, since then there were speculations about the future of the brand. While since 2021, Google launched three Pixel series smartwatches, including the Pixel Watch 3 at the recent 'Made for Google' event, there have been two Fitbit smartwatches -- Versa 4 and Sense 2.The Fitbit Versa 4 and Sense 2 were launched just months before Google’s first Pixel Watch.Google has now confirmed that Fitbit as a brand will no longer be making new smartwatches and that the Pixel Watch series will be taking over that form factor going forward. Speaking to Engadget, Google’s director of product management for Pixel wearables, Sandeep Waraich, said, “Pixel Watch is our smartwatch part of the portfolio”. Waraich said the same in response to a question about the future of the Fitbit-branded smartwatches, adding that Pixel Watch is “our next iteration of smartwatch for Fitbit.”But while you may not get Fitbit smartwatches, Fitbit brand per se is not being killed. Google will continue to make Fitbit fitness bands . Fitbit-branded products will focus on trackers that are “more minimalistic” with long battery life, said Waraich.As to what happens to Fitbit smartwatch customers . Google said, ""We are very committed to Fitbit, and even more importantly to the customers that use and depend on those products and technology. It's also worth noting that many of the health and fitness features we launched in Pixel Watch 3 were because of Fitbit's innovation and ground-breaking fitness advancements. In addition, we just launched Fitbit Ace LTE , and you’ll continue to see new products and innovation from Fitbit.""This means that Google will continue to provide software updates, and even new features to both devices.As for Pixel Watch fans, Google has launched Pixel Watch 3 in India, starting at RS 39,99. Pixel Watch 3 will go on sale in the country in September.","Google acquired Fitbit in 2021, since then there were speculations about the future of the brand.
