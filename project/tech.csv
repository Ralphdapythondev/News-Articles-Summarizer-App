Microsoft, Google also warned about Iranian hackers

Facebook parent Meta has issued a warning to the Kamala Harris and Donald Trump campaigns about Iranian hackers targeting them through WhatsApp. The company said that WhatsApp accounts linked to an Iranian “threat actor” sent messages pretending to be technical support for AOL, Google , Yahoo or Microsoft .“This malicious activity originated in Iran and attempted to target individuals in Israel, Palestine, Iran, the United States and the UK,” Meta said.“This effort appeared to have focused on political and diplomatic officials, and other public figures, including some associated with administrations of President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump,” it added.As per the company, it has blacked accounts involved in what appeared to be “social engineering”.“Given the heightened threat environment ahead of the US election, we also shared information about this malicious activity with law enforcement and with the presidential campaigns to encourage them to stay cautious against potential adversarial targeting,” Meta said.As per Meta, a probe linked the attempts to the same hacking group responsible for similar attacks aimed at political, military, diplomatic and other officials reported by Microsoft and Google.Google and Microsoft previously uncovered similar Iran-backed hacking attempts on the campaigns of US Vice President Kamala Harris and former US President Donald Trump.In fact, three US intelligence and security agencies also claimed that Iran was behind a recent hack targeting Trump's presidential campaign.Meanwhile, OpenAI noted that it took down a cluster of ChatGPT accounts that were being used to create content for a “covert Iranian influence operation.” The operation used ChatGPT to create articles and short commentary, which were then disseminated on social media platforms or websites.","Facebook parent Meta has issued a warning to the Kamala Harris and Donald Trump campaigns about Iranian hackers targeting them through WhatsApp. The company said that WhatsApp accounts linked to an Iranian “threat actor’ sent messages pretending to be technical support for AOL, Google, Yahoo or Microsoft.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112761267,imgsize-45432,width-400,resizemode-4/112761267.jpg"

Microsoft Copilot may be rebranded. A report has claimed that the Windows maker is looking to rename its AI-powered chatbot for its business arm. The new name will reportedly be used across Office apps.Citing sources familiar with Microsoft’s plans, The Verge reports that Microsoft is shifting its primary “Microsoft Copilot” brand to “Microsoft 365 Copilot,” emphasising the paid AI tool suite within Microsoft 365.This change also extends to specific Copilot integrations, like “Copilot in Word” becoming "" Microsoft 365 Copilot in Word.”The Copilots for Sales, Service, and Finance are all moving to the Microsoft 365 branding, which means it may result in “Microsoft 365 Copilot for Sales”.The graph and web-grounded chat experience within Microsoft 365 Copilot will be branded as "" Business Chat ."" This rebranding reflects internal shifts as different teams within Microsoft develop various Copilot offerings.While the Microsoft 365 team appears to be taking the lead on the Copilot brand, there's no single engineering owner for Copilot across Microsoft. It remains to be seen how future business-focused Copilots outside Microsoft 365 will be branded.This rebrand primarily affects the business side of Microsoft's AI efforts. Consumer-facing Copilot products, like the web Copilot and mobile apps, are expected to remain unchanged.Earlier this year, Microsoft’s direct competitor also rebranded its AI chatbot from Bard to Gemini. Gemini is also the name of its AI models. Google CEO Sundar Pichai explained that it reflects a single approach of building AI.""For us, Gemini is our approach overall in terms of how we are building our most capable and safe Al model and Bard was the most direct way that people could interact with our models so it really made sense to just evolve it to be Gemini because you are talking directly to the underlying Gemini model when you use it,"" Pichai said during an interview with CNBC.""I think it will also be the way by which we will keep advancing our models and users can experience it directly, so we thought the name change made sense,"" he added.Gemini LLM are available in three tiers: Gemini Nano, Gemini Pro and Gemini Advanced.",Microsoft Copilot may be rebranded.

Watch: Android malware uses smartphone's NFC reader to steal payment card details,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/watch-android-malware-uses-smartphones-nfc-reader-to-steal-payment-card-details/articleshow/112760220.cms,"Lukas Stefanko - Unmasking NGate

How this malware can be dangerous



“NGate malware app can relay NFC data from a victim’s card through a compromised device to an attacker’s smartphone, which is then able to emulate the card and withdraw money from an ATM.”

“This is a new Android attack scenario, and it is the first time we have seen Android malware with this capability being used in the wild,”

“to clone UID of some NFC cards and tokens to access restricted areas,”

How attackers are spreading this malware



Researchers have discovered a new Android malware which uses the Near Field Communication ( NFC ) reader of an infected smartphone to steal payment card details . According security research firm ESET, the malware collects card data and relays it to attackers who then create effective clones of contactless payment cards that work at ATMs or point-of-sale terminals.The researchers have named the malware "" NGate ,"" which leverages the open-source NFCGate tool to exploit NFC-enabled devices. In a video uploaded on YouTube, security researcher Lukas Stefanko demonstrates how the Android malware works. Watch the video here:In the video, Stefanko explains:he added.The researchers also noted that NGate, or similar apps, could potentially be used in other contexts, such as cloning smart cards used for various purposes. The attack would function by replicating the unique identifier (UID) of the NFC tag.This malware can also be possibly usedStefanko added.In a statement to Ars Technica, Stefanko and another ESET researcher Jakub Osmani explained that attackers are employing a sophisticated phishing scheme targeting bank customers. The attack involves sending SMS messages with links to malicious websites impersonating banks. Once victims install the malicious PWA and enter their credentials, attackers gain access to their accounts.To further deceive victims, attackers pose as bank employees, claiming that their accounts have been compromised due to the phishing attack. They then guide victims to download the NGate malware, which is used to steal sensitive banking information and facilitate unauthorised transactions.Attackers can use NGate to change withdrawal limits and transfer funds to other accounts without leaving traces. This highlights the importance of being vigilant against phishing attempts and protecting personal information.",Researchers have discovered a new Android malware which uses the Near Field Communication ( NFC ) reader of an infected smartphone to steal payment card details.

Facebook parent company Meta ’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Spotify chief executive Daniel Ek have critisised European regulations on open-source artificial intelligence (AI). They argue that the complex rules could hinder innovation and cause Europe to fall behind in AI development.Europe, which “has more open-source developers than America”, is well placed to make the most of the open-source AI wave, news agency Reuters cited the CEOs as saying.“Yet its fragmented regulatory structure, riddled with inconsistent implementation, is hampering innovation and holding back developers,” the CEOs noted.The CEOs said the tech industry in Europe faces “overlapping regulations and inconsistent guidance on how to comply with them” instead of clear rules.The CEOs advocated for a streamlined regulatory framework that would support European developers and promote innovation in the AI sector.Earlier this year, Prince Constantijn of the Netherlands said that Europe’s approach to regularise AI may become a reason for the region to fall behind the US and China on AI development.“Our ambition seems to be limited to being good regulators,” Constantijn told CNBC on the sidelines of the Money 20/20 fintech conference in Amsterdam.“We’ve seen this in the data space [with GDPR], we’ve seen this now in the platform space, and now with the AI space,” added Constantijn, who is the third and youngest son of former Dutch Queen Beatrix.Prince Constantijn said he’s “really concerned” that Europe’s focus has been more on regulating AI than trying to become a leader in innovation.“It’s good to have guardrails. We want to bring clarity to the market, predictability and all that. But it’s very hard to do that in such a fast-moving space,” he added.“There are big risks in getting it wrong, and like we’ve seen in genetically modified organisms, it hasn’t stopped the development. It just stopped Europe developing it, and now we are consumers of the product, rather than producers able to influence the market as it develops,” he added.According to Constantijn, Europe is making it “quite hard” for itself to innovate in AI due to “big restrictions on data.”",Mark Zuckerberg and Daniel Ek criticise European regulations on open-source AI.

Tensor G4, Gemini and more AI inside

Upgraded cameras with the new 'Add me' AI feature for photos

Google has launched its second-generation Pixel foldable phone, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold , which is its first-ever foldable phone in India. The second-gen Pixel Fold upgrades on some salient aspects over the first one. Per Google, the foldable is slim, super durable, and has a brighter screen, both on the outside and inside. And, the phone also packs in Pixel’s “fastest, most powerful” Tensor G4 chip , bringing on-device multimodal capabilities to the phone.On the inside, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold comes equipped with an 8 inches ‘Super Actua Flex display,’ an LTPO panel with a 2922x1344 resolution at 486 PPI. The inner screen has a dynamic refresh rate of 1-120Hz and can go as bright as 3,000 nits, which Google says is 80% brighter than the screen on the first-gen Pixel Fold. To make use of phone’s large inner canvas, there’s a split-screen mode that’ll let you use two apps side-by-side.When unfolded, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold can be used a regular phone with a 6.3 inches outer screen, which has the same specs as the inner screen.Google says that the Pixel 9 Pro Fold has an “all-new” hinge that is made from stainless steel and has an aerospace grade aluminium alloy cover. The hinge has a polished finish, while the back has the silky matt finish. The phone is rated IPX8 for water resistivity. And there’s Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the outside.Powering the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is Google’s Tensor G4 chip, also found on the other three Pixel 9 phones. The chip comes paired with 16GB of RAM and up to 1TB storage. Then, there’s theTitan M2 security coprocessor , which enables multi-layer hardware security.There’s a 5,060mAh battery, which Google promises will last for over 24 hours and up to 100 hours with Extreme Battery Saver. The phone supports fast charging at 45W, which should fill up the battery up to 55% in about 30 minutes. FYI, the charger isn’t included in the box. The phone also supports Qi wireless charging and Battery Share, i.e., reverse wireless charging.Out-of-the-box the Pixel 9 Pro Fold will come with Android 14 . There’s the usual Google promise of 7 years of OS and security updates.Would it even be a Pixel phone, if there’s no AI in it. Well, there’s a whole lot of AI. For starters Gemini is there, and it works in split-screen mode, as well. One could ask Gemini to write stuff or even get info about whats’s on the screen or photos. Circle To Search is also there, ohh and this feature can help you check if an image has been created using AI.The new “Pixel-exclusive” AI feature to arrive is Pixel Screenshots. The feature could organise or recall things, like events and location, all you need to is ask the phone.Google is giving one year of the Google One AI Premium plan for free to those who’ll buy the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. So, that’ll give you access to Gemini Advanced, Gemini in Gmail and Docs, on top of 2TB of cloud storage.The Pixel 9 Pro Fold ditches the camera visor for a squircle module that houses a triple lens setup – a 50MP wide camera, a 48MP ultraide and a 48MP 5x telephoto camera. For selfies, there's a 42 MP front-facing camera on the inner screen and 10MP camera on the outside.The camera hardware has been only a part of Pixel’s camera, but it’s AI that completes it. There’s a long list of AI features that complements the camera hardware on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. The usual Super Res Zoom, Zoom Enhance, Video Boost, Face Unblur, Photo Unblur, Best Take, Magic Eraser, Audio Eraser, and Magic Editor makes their return. Well, Magic Eraser now has an a “reimagine” feature that Google says can give photos a “whole new look.”One new AI tool to come to Google’s Pixel 9 pro Fold is the “Add Me,” which as you’d image can add you to a picture. So, how does it work? Well, you take photo with the group, swap in yourself, and AI will merge the photos.Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold is priced in India at Rs 1,72,999 and will be available for purchase later this year. While it comes in two colours – Obsidian and Porcelain – it’ll be available only in Obsidian colour in India.","Google has launched its second-generation Pixel foldable phone, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold.

General Motors is laying off more than 1,000 salaried employees globally in its software and services division, the company confirmed earlier this week.

GM has recently faced challenges with software issues in its new Chevy Blazer EV, including blank infotainment screens and charging error messages. The company issued a stop sale notice last December due to these problems, which was lifted in March.The layoffs also come after GM cancelled its ""Ultra Cruise"" programme, a competitor to Tesla's Full Self-Driving system, in January. The company merged the FSD team with its regular Super Cruise team.Despite the layoffs and recent setbacks, the company says it continues to work on expanding its hands-free driving system, with plans to broaden its capabilities by the end of 2025.","GM is laying off more than 1,000 salaried employees globally in its software and services division.

“Believe it or not, I just don't like India. Also I can sense an Indian, he is Indian. If a man online suddenly talks about ducking your mother in the first response, he's Indian. Many such cases.”

A UK-based YouTuber named Miles Routledge has faced backlash after he made several racist remarks targeting Indians on the social media platform X (earlier known as Twitter). It all started with a meme video that he uploaded on X as a joke.

"Court: Burger King has ""miserably failed"" to prove trademark infringement case against Pune restaurant",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/court-burger-king-has-miserably-failed-to-prove-trademark-infringement-case-against-pune-restaurant/articleshow/112625209.cms,"Court says no to monetary damages to Pune eatery

In a surprising verdict, a Pune district court has dismissed a 13-year-old lawsuit filed by the American fast-food chain Burger King Corporation against a locally-owned eatery with the same name. The US company had accused the Pune-based Burger King of trademark infringement and sought a permanent injunction, damages, and a halt to the use of the name. The court dismissed the lawsuit filed by the Burger King Corporation in 2011, seeking a permanent injunction restraining infringement of trademark.However, the court ruled in favor of the local eatery, stating that it had been operating under the name ""Burger King"" since 1991-92, well before the US chain entered the Indian market.The plaintiff's first Indian BURGER KING restaurant was opened in New Delhi on November 9, 2014, the court said.The court found no evidence to support Burger King Corporation's claim that customers were confused or misled by the local eatery's use of the name. Additionally, the company failed to prove any actual financial loss due to the alleged infringement. The court said the Burger King Corporation has ""miserably failed"" to prove that the eatery here had infringed its trademark Burger King while running the restaurant in Pune.Burger King filed the lawsuit against Anahita Irani and Shapoor Irani. The Iranis opposed the suit, saying it was filed with malafide intentions and to discourage business people who are bonafide users and retailers. They said that apart from the name Burger King, there was absolutely no similarity in the plaintiff's trademark and their own shop name.This decision may have implications for trademark disputes involving established local businesses and multinational corporations.The Pune-based restaurant owners had counterclaimed for damages due to the harassment they endured during the lengthy legal battle. They sought Rs 20 lakh as damages. The court, however, refused any monetary relief to them too, noting that apart from oral evidence, no other proof was submitted to substantiate their claims.","Pune court dismisses 13-year-old lawsuit filed by Burger King Corporation.
