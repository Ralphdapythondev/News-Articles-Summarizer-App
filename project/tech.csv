What the company said

AT&T has confirmed a major data breach impacting a staggering number of its customers. The company revealed that criminals were able to illegally download files containing call and text records for ""nearly all"" of its cellular customers, mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) customers using AT&T's network, and even landline customers who interacted with those cellular numbers.The compromised data reportedly includes call detail records (CDRs), which could reveal the phone numbers involved in a call, the date and duration of the call, and potentially the location data associated with the call.Text message content itself is not believed to be part of the breach. The timeframe for the exposed data ranges from May 1, 2022, to October 31, 2022.According to AT&T, the hackers accessed the data through a third-party cloud platform where the company stores its customer information. While the investigation is ongoing, AT&T believes the attackers exploited a vulnerability on this platform.AT&T has assured customers that they are taking steps to address the breach and mitigate the risks. The company is working with law enforcement to investigate the incident and apprehend those involved. Additionally, AT&T is offering credit monitoring services to affected customers.“Protecting your data is one of our top priorities. We have confirmed the affected access point has been secured. We hold ourselves to a high standard and commit to delivering the experience that you deserve. We constantly evaluate and enhance our security to address changing cybersecurity threats and work to create a secure environment for you. We invest in our network’s security using a broad array of resources including people, capital, and innovative technology advancements,” said the company.","AT&T has confirmed a major data breach impacting a staggering number of its customers.

Google ends independent ‘Lacros’ browser effort as Android integration takes center stage,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-ends-independent-lacros-browser-effort-as-android-integration-takes-center-stage/articleshow/111702731.cms,"After nearly three years of development, Google has announced the end of the Lacros experiment, an initiative aimed at independently updating the Chrome browser on Chromebooks . This decision underscores Google's growing focus on integrating Android 's capabilities directly into ChromeOS.Launched in August 2023, Lacros was designed to address a pain point for Chromebook users.By separating the Chrome browser from the core ChromeOS system, Google aimed to deliver faster and more frequent browser updates without requiring a full OS update. Lacros offered the potential for Chromebook users to experience the latest features and security patches in the Chrome browser more quickly.However, Google's recent announcement reveals a change in course. The company believes it can achieve ""similar objectives"" by leveraging the ongoing integration of Android's underlying functionalities within ChromeOS. This approach suggests that Google might be phasing out the need for a separate browser update system altogether.While the specific details remain under wraps, Google's decision to prioritize Android integration hints at the future of ChromeOS browsing. It's possible that future Chromebooks might not require a separate Chrome browser update system, with updates being delivered seamlessly through the core ChromeOS framework. This could lead to a more streamlined and user-friendly browsing experience for Chromebook users.With the Lacros experiment coming to a close, ChromeOS users will be looking forward to more details from Google regarding its future plans for browser updates and the evolving role of Android within the ChromeOS ecosystem.","Google has announced the end of the Lacros experiment, an initiative aimed at independently updating the Chrome browser on Chromebooks.

What Huawei said on the ban

Impact of Russia-Ukraine war

Germany has announced plans to phase out equipment from Chinese telecom giants Huawei and ZTE in its 5G networks, citing national security concerns, according to AFP news agency. This move reflects a growing trend in Europe and the US to distance themselves from these Chinese companies.The German interior ministry stated that ""core"" 5G networks will no longer use Huawei and ZTE components by the end of 2026.In 5G access and transmission infrastructure, the companies' systems must be replaced by the end of 2029. Agreements have reportedly been reached with German network operators Deutsche Telekom, Vodafone, and Telefonica regarding the ban.Interior Minister Nancy Faeser emphasized the need to protect ""critical infrastructure"" and communication channels for citizens, businesses, and the government. Germany aims to reduce reliance on a single supplier and mitigate potential cyberattacks that could be ""existential threats."" Germany is seeking to ""de-risk"" its economy by reducing dependence on China.This decision by Germany is widely seen to signify a significant shift in its approach to Chinese technology and aligns with broader European and US concerns regarding national security. The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, described Huawei and ZTE as a risk to the bloc and called on EU member states to exclude the companies' equipment from their mobile networks in 2023. The UK and Sweden have already implemented similar bans on Huawei in their 5G networks. The US has also pressured allies to exclude these companies due to spying concerns.Huawei maintains its technology is ""secure and reliable,"" while the Chinese embassy in Berlin called the decision ""groundless."" The ban reflects a broader strain in China-Germany relations, particularly after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.China and Germany are said to have long had close ties, with Germany's crucial manufacturers -- from auto companies to machine-tool makers -- exporting vast quantities of products to the world's number two economy. However, Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent energy crisis triggered led to Berlin seeking to ""de-risk"" by cutting its reliance on China.There have been growing signs of the government's new tougher approach. Earlier this month, Berlin blocked the sale of a gas turbine unit belonging to a subsidiary of the Volkswagen group to a Chinese investor after media reports suggested it had close links to the Chinese armaments industry.","Germany has announced plans to phase out equipment from Chinese telecom giants Huawei and ZTE in its 5G networks.

UK government’s guidance on smartphone use by kids

In a major move, a posh boarding school in the UK has decided to swap its students’ smartphones for the classic Nokia phones, reports CBS News.

Prince William and Harry, Ian Fleming, Tom Hiddleston and novelist George Orwell are some of its notable alumni.As per the report, parents of first-year students at Eton College were informed about the changes in a letter. It reportedly said that the incoming 13-year-old boarders must transfer their SIM cards to offline Nokia phones given by schools. The phone will only be able to make phone calls and send text messages.The report quotes a school spokesperson who said “Eton routinely reviews our mobile phone and devices policy to balance the benefits and challenges that technology brings to schools.” He further added that those joining in Year 9, essentially the equivalent of freshman year in high school for American students, “will receive a 'brick' phone for use outside the school day, as well as a school-issued iPad to support academic study.”According to Ofcom, the UK government's communications regulator, 97% of children have their own smartphone phone by the age of 12. In the new guidelines issued in February this year, the government advised all schools to “have a behaviour policy which is aligned with the school’s legal duties and standards relating to the welfare of children.
