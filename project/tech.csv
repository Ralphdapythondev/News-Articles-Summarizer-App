The $7.5 billion deal that Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella 'sealed' in 20 minutes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/the-7-5-billion-deal-that-microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-sealed-in-20-minutes/articleshow/111712411.cms,"Microsoft's $7.5 billion GitHub deal

Earlier this year, Satya Nadella completed 10 years as Microsoft CEO. Nadella took over as Microsoft CEO in February 2014. Soon after taking over the helm, Nadella is said to have rapidly overhauled the almost 40-year-old company. Nadella is reported to have ""pushed Microsoft to embrace cloud computing and open-source software that customers could freely adapt to."" Nadella introduced a wave of open-source technologies, supercharging Microsoft’s cloud business.Over the years, under Nadella's leadership Microsoft has doubled its market share in cloud computing, cementing its role as the No. 2 behind Amazon , a position it continues to hold -- followed by search giant Google.A recent report in New York Times, talks about various deals that the company has made under CEO Nadella including the $7.5 billion acquisition of developers platform GitHub . Nadella reportedly 'sealed' the deal in 20 minutes.""In 2018, he needed only 20 minutes to greenlight the acquisition of the world’s most important open-source company: GitHub, the site where developers shared and collaborated on software code,"" said the report.After executives spent years debating whether to buy GitHub, Nat Friedman, a former Microsoft executive who worked for Nadella for five years, told New York Times that he pitched the idea to Nadella and other senior leaders at an annual executive retreat at the Suncadia Resort in the Cascade Mountains.“Do we have the right to do this?” Nadella reportedly asked. ""In other words: Would people still use GitHub if it was run by Microsoft?"" The executives are said to have debated the question for 20 minutes, Friedman said. ""Then Nadella slapped his hand on the table and said, “We should do it.” Report adds that within weeks, Nadella agreed to buy GitHub for $7.5 billion in June 2018.“We will accelerate enterprise developers’ use of GitHub, with our direct sales and partner channels and access to Microsoft’s global cloud infrastructure and services,” Nadella had said on the acquisition.","Satya Nadella took over as Microsoft CEO in February 2014.

10 terms Microsoft wants everyone should know in AI era,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/10-terms-microsoft-wants-everyone-should-know-in-ai-era/articleshow/111717945.cms,"Artificial intelligence

Machine Learning

Large Language Model

Generative AI

Hallucinations

Responsible AI

Multimodal models

Copilots

While the concept of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been around for decades, recent breakthroughs in machine learning have significantly boosted its development and public awareness. The term gained wider recognition in 2022 when OpenAI launched ChatGPT chatbot. This, coupled with major companies like Microsoft , Google and Facebook-parent Meta entering the field with impactful AI products, propelled AI into the mainstream.Today, a multitude of AI companies are driving the next wave of innovation, with new terminology emerging to define this exciting landscape. Here are 10 key AI terms you should be familiar with.Artificial intelligence (AI) is a super-smart computer system that can imitate human tasks like understanding language, making decisions, translating languages, analysing sentiment, and learning from experience. AI processes vast amounts of data through algorithms to create models that automate tasks requiring human intelligence.Machine learning (ML) is a subset of AI and the method to achieve it. In ML, computer systems learn to identify patterns and make predictions by running data through algorithms repeatedly with varying inputs and feedback, much like practising piano scales millions of times to sight-read music. ML is ideal for solving complex problems like image recognition and language translation.Large language models (LLMs) use machine learning to mimic human communication and are the underlying technology of all chatbots. Based on neural networks (NNs), which are inspired by the human brain, they are trained on massive amounts of text to learn language patterns and relationships.Generative AI leverages the power of LLMs to make new things, not just rewrite or provide information about existing things. It learns patterns and structures and then generates something that’s similar but new. It can make things like pictures, music, text, videos and code.Generative AI can create stories, poems, and songs but can also produce inaccurate responses, which it presents as if they are factually true. This is called ""hallucinations"" or ""fabrications,"" because it can't distinguish between real and fake information.Responsible AI is a term used to denote that systems are safe and fair at every level, including the machine learning model, software, user interface, and application access rules. It's crucial for systems that make important decisions in areas like education and healthcare, as they can reflect human biases from their training data.A multimodal model can simultaneously work with different data types, such as images, sounds, and text. It combines this information to perform tasks like answering questions about images, making it the ultimate multitask.A prompt is an instruction in language, images, or code that tells the AI what task to perform. Engineers and users should carefully design prompts to achieve the desired outcome from large language models.Copilots is a terminology used by Microsoft to denote its AI models in its products that help users expedite the working. It is essentially a digital assistant that helps with tasks like writing, coding, summarising and searching across various applications.Plugins for AI function similarly to apps on a smartphone, enabling AI applications to fulfil specific needs without altering the core model. They facilitate interaction with other software, access to new information, performing complex calculations, and interfacing with other programs, thereby enhancing the AI's capabilities by integrating it more deeply into the digital ecosystem.","Artificial intelligence (AI) is a super-smart computer system.

During a recent visit to the country, Dohmke highlighted the importance of understanding a company's unique workflow and codebase in an interaction with the Times of India.""If I were to join a software company in Bengaluru, the first thing I would have to figure out is how they operate,"" Dohmke told TOI.He emphasised that even with years of software engineering experience, adapting to a new company's processes is crucial.The GitHub chief explained that the next step would be to dive deep into the company's existing code. ""Then I have to figure out how things work, what's in which file, what did the engineer think when they built a particular thing, and how I can now extend it,"" he said.Dohmke's comments came as part of a broader discussion on the evolving landscape of software development , particularly in light of advancing AI technologies . He stressed that understanding a company's specific context remains a critical skill, even as AI tools become more prevalent in coding.To address these challenges, GitHub has developed AI-powered tools like Co-pilot Workspace . This new product features three AI agents designed to assist developers in refining project ideas, determining necessary files, and implementing tasks.While acknowledging the power of AI in coding, Dohmke maintained that human skills in understanding and navigating complex software environments remain invaluable.

The decision marks the conclusion of a four-year project aimed at improving update speeds and performance for Chromebook users.LaCros, short for Linux and ChromeOS, was designed to separate the Chrome browser from the underlying operating system, potentially allowing for faster updates and extended support for older devices.Google began development in 2020 and made it available for testing in August 2023.Despite its promise, Google has decided to discontinue LaCros support with ChromeOS version 128. The company stated that embracing portions of the Android stack would be a more effective way to accelerate innovation on Chromebooks.""We believe this will be a more effective way to help accelerate the pace of innovation on Chromebook,"" Google explained in a post on the ChromeOS Beta Tester Community Forum.The tech giant assures users that this change will not impact their Chromebook experience.

Additionally, Google's recent announcement about building ChromeOS on the Android Linux Kernel aims to further align development between the two platforms.While some users who relied on LaCros for features like account switching may be affected, the majority of Chromebook users are unlikely to notice any changes in their day-to-day usage.","Google is ending support for LaCros, an experimental standalone browser for Chromebooks.

UK government’s guidance on smartphone use by kids

In a major move, a posh boarding school in the UK has decided to swap its students’ smartphones for the classic Nokia phones, reports CBS News.

Prince William and Harry, Ian Fleming, Tom Hiddleston and novelist George Orwell are some of its notable alumni.As per the report, parents of first-year students at Eton College were informed about the changes in a letter. It reportedly said that the incoming 13-year-old boarders must transfer their SIM cards to offline Nokia phones given by schools. The phone will only be able to make phone calls and send text messages.The report quotes a school spokesperson who said “Eton routinely reviews our mobile phone and devices policy to balance the benefits and challenges that technology brings to schools.” He further added that those joining in Year 9, essentially the equivalent of freshman year in high school for American students, “will receive a 'brick' phone for use outside the school day, as well as a school-issued iPad to support academic study.”According to Ofcom, the UK government's communications regulator, 97% of children have their own smartphone phone by the age of 12. In the new guidelines issued in February this year, the government advised all schools to “have a behaviour policy which is aligned with the school’s legal duties and standards relating to the welfare of children.
