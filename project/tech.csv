With the growing influence of generative AI , India's quick commerce platforms are increasingly incorporating AI technology to enhance customer experiences and improve personalization. By deploying AI-driven tools, platforms such as Zomato , Swiggy , and BlinkIt have streamlined product recommendations, optimised delivery routes, and introduced virtual assistants to simplify user interactions.These advancements improve operational efficiency and cater to individual preferences. However, the adoption of AI also presents significant challenges, including high implementation costs and concerns surrounding data privacy, which these platforms must navigate while expanding their technological capabilities.Zomato introduced a personalised AI food assistant, available initially for Zomato Gold members. The AI assistant provides tailored restaurant and dish recommendations based on user preferences. It can answer specific queries, such as ""What should I eat when I’m hungover?"" or suggest low-carb, high-protein meals. Zomato's AI stack is built on OpenAI’s large language models (LLMs) and is powered through Microsoft Azure. Additionally, Zomato uses AI on the backend to optimise delivery times and improve customer support.However, Zomato has taken a firm stance against AI-generated content for restaurants, banning the use of AI-generated images in menus and promotional materials. The company has developed tools to detect such content, warning restaurants of removal if they fail to comply.BlinkIt, Zomato’s quick commerce arm, rolled out an AI-driven feature called ""Recipe Rover"" in May 2023. This tool helps users discover recipes and simplifies meal planning by offering curated recipe suggestions based on special occasions, such as Ganesh Utsav. The recipes also provide macro-nutrient information, making meal planning more health-conscious. Powered by Midjourney and OpenAI’s GPT models, Recipe Rover helps users not only find recipes but also directly source the ingredients needed.Swiggy launched its own AI-powered recommendation tool, ‘What to Eat,’ which personalises food suggestions based on user mood, past orders, and trending dishes. The neural search engine developed by Swiggy offers users transparency, explaining why specific recommendations are made. Swiggy plans to enhance this feature with voice-based and multi-language support, making it accessible across various regions of India.Swiggy is also focusing on optimising its operations through AI, with AI-powered route optimization for delivery agents. The company plans to introduce an AI chatbot to assist users within Dineout, as well as an AI-powered bot for restaurant partners to address onboarding and other operational concerns.Myntra, a leading fashion e-commerce platform, launched MyFashionGPT in partnership with Microsoft. This AI assistant goes beyond conventional keyword searches, allowing users to ask open-ended queries like ""Show me clothes for a beach vacation"" and receiving suggestions spanning multiple categories. Myntra has also introduced Maya, an AI fashion influencer, to enhance customer engagement.Myntra continues to experiment with generative AI for customer support and creative automation. Upcoming AI capabilities include full outfit previews and enhanced voice search functionalities. Myntra ’s shift towards AI-driven personalization comes as the company pilots quick commerce services in select Indian cities, offering four-hour delivery windows.","India's quick commerce platforms are increasingly incorporating AI technology to enhance customer experiences and improve personalization.

Star Health hacking

Weeks after it was reported that sensitive data of Star Health customers is being disseminated via bots on Telegram , the instant messaging platform has said that it acted swiftly to remove bots that were sharing private information from the insurer. It also emphasised its commitment to user privacy and its strict policy against sharing private information.""The bots reported to Telegram for sharing Star Health data were immediately removed and moderators are monitoring to prevent them from being recreated,"" Telegram stated in a statement shared with The Times of India Tech team.“The sharing of private information on Telegram is expressly forbidden and such content is deleted whenever it is found,” the statement added.This action follows reports that hackers were using Telegram bots to disseminate Star Health customer data , including sensitive medical records and personal information such as full names, PAN numbers, mobile numbers, emails, date of birth, residential addresses, insured date of birth, gender, pre-existing diseases, policy numbers, health cards, nominee names, age, claims, nominee relationship, insured height, weight, BMI and more.Last month, news agency Reuters reported that a self-styled hacker named xenZen claims to have records of Star Health customer data and is disseminating it through Telegram chatbots.“The sharing of private information on Telegram is expressly forbidden and is removed whenever it is found. Telegram deleted the original two bots sharing this data when they were discovered. Any newly-created bots attempting to share this data were likely removed as part of a massive sweep of Telegram's searchable content which resulted in an estimated 90% of harmful content there being removed,” the platform said in a statement last month.The hacker also claimed on his website that the insurer’s chief information security officer, Amarjeet Khanuja “sold all this data to me”.On this, Star health said that the company “CISO has been duly co-operating in the investigation and we have not arrived at any finding of wrongdoing by him till date.”",Telegram has removed bots that were sharing private information from the insurer.

Four employees of Apple’s biggest supplier Foxconn detained in China,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/four-employees-of-apples-biggest-supplier-foxconn-detained-in-china/articleshow/114149816.cms,"How this detention has affected Foxconn



Tensions rise between China and Taiwan



Four Taiwanese employees of Apple ’s key supplier Foxconn have been reportedly detained in China. A report by Taiwan ’s national news agency, the Central News Agency (CNA) cited the Taiwanese government to claim that these workers have been detained in Zhengzhou , the home of Foxconn’s largest iPhone factory, by the local public security bureau for the equivalent of “breach of trust” since January.However, the exact nature of the allegations couldn’t be determined.Taiwanese agencies responsible for managing relations with China said that these employees worked at a complex run by Taiwan’s Foxconn that makes products for Apple in Zhengzhou. The Zhengzhou facility plays a central role in Apple’s iPhone supply chain and has sometimes been called iPhone City.The Mainland Affairs Council, responsible for Taiwan's policy towards China, has described the allegations against the employees as “bizarre,” reports WSJ. Taiwanese authorities are calling for a swift and transparent investigation into the detention of four Foxconn employees in China, emphasizing that such incidents could undermine investor confidence in the country.Foxconn has reportedly stated that it did not suffer any financial losses related to the employees' actions. However, the detentions have raised concerns in Taiwan, prompting the council to urge China to ensure the safety and legal rights of Taiwanese citizens working in the country.This incident comes amidst heightened tensions between China and Taiwan and adds to growing concerns about the risks faced by foreign workers in China. In June, the Taiwanese government raised its travel alert level for China, advising citizens to avoid non-essential trips due to concerns overnational security laws and arbitrary detentions.China recently introduced rules targeting pro-Taiwan independence figures, with threats including the death penalty, which has raised concerns for Taiwanese nationals working in China. Taiwanese authorities, through the Straits Exchange Foundation, are assisting Foxconn and the families of detained individuals.The incident follows Foxconn's earlier investigation by Chinese tax and land authorities in 2023, coinciding with the company's founder, Terry Gou's, brief run for Taiwan's presidency. Foreign businesses operating in China, such as Foxconn, have been uneasy due to detentions, including those of a Japanese executive and an Australian journalist.Meanwhile, despite these tensions, Chinese officials continue to express the desire to attract foreign investment. The Shanghai city government recently highlighted challenges stemming from Apple's decision to diversify production away from China to other countries like India and Vietnam.","Four Taiwanese employees of Apple's key supplier Foxconn have been reportedly detained in China.

What Elon Musk said about Ratan Tata in the video



“Take for a moment Ratan Tata, what he’s doing in India — developing a little sedan for $2300. Where do you put that in the whole equation of where the future of cars is?”

“I think it’s a good idea to have

affordable cars

, but I think the problem is with something like the Nano … I wouldn’t say it’s a problem because I think, by the way, it is probably a great idea and Ratan is a gentleman and scholar.”

“But where it’s going to become challenging in the future is when the price of gasoline rises; the cost of acquiring the car is much less of an issue than the cost of running the car,”

A video of Tesla CEO Elon Musk praising Ratan Tata 's vision for the Tata Nano has resurfaced and gone viral following the Indian industrialist 's passing. The clip from 20029, shared by X user Nico Garcia, features Musk in conversation with TV presenter Charlie Rose , discussing Tata's ambitious goal of creating an affordable car for the masses.Musk expresses admiration for Tata's pursuit of the Rs 1 lakh car, acknowledging the challenges and complexities involved in bringing such a project to fruition.The video has resonated with many as India mourns the loss of Ratan Tata, who transformed the Tata Group into a global powerhouse.While discussing the future of cars, Rose asked Musk:Replying to that, Musk said:Musk added.The video has already received over 3.3 lakh views and thousands of likes.

Zerodha co-founder and CEO Nithin Kamath , his brother and Zerodha co-founder Nikhil Kamath and CTO Kailash Nadh were recently at the company's Bangalore office for a podcast. Speaking at the special for CNBC-TV18’s Young Turks Reloaded podcast, the trio discussed the challenges they face as their company continues to grow.Nikhil Kamath highlighted the fear and uncertainty that pervades the startup ecosystem, emphasizing the need for a more collaborative approach between entrepreneurs, regulators, and the government.He argued that excessive regulations can stifle innovation and discourage entrepreneurship. “We are subject to regulators who we don't really have any influence [with] or access to their decisions, who can reduce our revenues by 50% in one day. They can make us shut down,” he said.However, Kamath is quick to add that Indian regulators have made the system more robust. But them he said that excessive regulations too can be bad. “In a classroom with 50 kids, where the teacher makes the rules and reprimands kids at will, will there be innovation coming out of those kids who are living in fear? Likely not,” he says.Nithin Kamath echoed these sentiments, noting that Zerodha's recent revenue growth is likely to slow down due to new regulations imposed by the Securities & Exchange Board of India (SEBI). He cited the true-to-label circular as one example of a regulation that will negatively impact the company's bottom line. “Running a broking firm is a tough job,” Nithin Kamath said.Despite the challenges, the Zerodha founders remain optimistic about the future of the Indian startup ecosystem. They believe that by fostering a more collaborative and supportive environment, India can achieve significant growth and innovation.His wry comment follows on the heels of Nikhil’s much more alarming declaration, “I feel like there's a lot of fear, not just here but everywhere in the ecosystem. There are many people who are scared.” But Nikhil is not just talking about the broking business; he’s talking about the startup ecosystem and the innovation ecosystem. “If I were to look at what can help India go from A to B… having an ally mentality, where entrepreneurs work with regulators, work with the government, and if we are able to mitigate fear to a large degree, more people will go out and attempt entrepreneurship,” he elaborates.",Zerodha co-founder and CEO Nithin Kamath spoke to CNBC-TV18's Young Turks Reloaded podcast.

What the lawsuit against Cognizant claimed

A US court has found that Cognizant Technology Solutions engaged in discriminatory employment practices against non-Indian workers. The verdict came after a trial that began in 2013, where plaintiffs alleged the tech giant favored H-1B visa holders from India over local employees.The jury awarded punitive damages to the plaintiffs, who claimed they were terminated after being replaced by ""visa-ready"" workers from India.The case centered on allegations of bias based on race and nationality, with plaintiffs asserting that Cognizant's policies and practices disproportionately impacted non-South Asian employees.Cognizant vehemently denied the allegations and plans to appeal the verdict. The company stated that it provides equal employment opportunities for all and has a diverse and inclusive workplace. A Cognizant spokesperson said the company is disappointed with the verdict and plans to appeal. ""Cognizant is disappointed with the verdict and plans to vigorously defend itself and appeal at the appropriate time. We provide equal employment opportunities for all employees and have built a diverse and inclusive workplace that promotes a culture of belonging in which all employees feel valued, are engaged and have the opportunity to develop and succeed. Cognizant does not tolerate discrimination and takes such claims seriously,"" a company spokesperson said.The case began after three employees who identify as “Caucasian” claimed in a lawsuit that Cognizant made a practice of giving preference to South Asians in employment decisions. The plaintiffs alleged they were terminated after being “benched” with no work for five weeks and then replaced by “visa-ready” workers from India set to be deployed to US projects and assignments. Cognizant employed around 40,000 employees in the US.A Bloomberg report claimed Cognizant had the highest number of H-1B visas of any US employer from 2013 to 2019, according to Citizenship and Immigration Services.","A US court has found that Cognizant Technology Solutions engaged in discriminatory employment practices against non-Indian workers.

Can robots think like humans in the future? Insights of the robotic 'thinking' abilities,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/can-robots-think-like-humans-in-the-future-insights-of-the-robotic-thinking-abilities/articleshow/114141051.cms,"Enhanced robotic processing unlocks 'thinking' potential



Implications for the future of robotics



Current challenges and the path forward



The prospect of robots achieving human-like thinking capabilities might seem far-fetched, yet researchers from King’s College London have proposed a groundbreaking approach that could make this vision a reality. Their innovative method centres on providing robots with complex instructions while minimising reliance on electricity, a strategy aimed at enhancing the cognitive abilities of robotic systems .The researchers have developed a new type of compact circuit that operates by utilising variations in pressure within a fluid. By issuing a series of commands to robotic devices through this advanced circuitry, they enable a kind of computational efficiency that frees up ""mental space"" within the robot's architecture. This, in turn, facilitates a more sophisticated processing capability, allowing robots to engage in what can be described as ""thinking.""Dr. Antonio Forte, the senior author of the study and a lecturer in Engineering at King's College London, explains that by delegating tasks across various components of a robotic system, the overall computational demand is reduced. This delegation enhances the robot’s ability to understand and react to social contexts, potentially leading to more nuanced interactions and greater dexterity. Such advancements could significantly impact fields like social care and manufacturing, where robots might need to navigate complex human environments and tasks.According to the journal published in Advanced Science , these findings suggest that if this approach is successfully implemented, it could lead to the development of robots capable of functioning in environments where traditional, electricity-dependent devices are ineffective. This has profound implications for low-income countries with unreliable electricity access, where such robots could provide essential services without the constraints of power availability.Dr. Forte elaborates on the dichotomy between the ""brain"" and ""body"" of robots. While an artificial intelligence ( AI ) brain might efficiently manage tasks like city traffic systems, many robots still struggle with basic physical actions, such as opening a door. This discrepancy highlights a critical gap in robotics: while software capabilities have advanced rapidly, hardware innovations have not kept pace. By creating a hardware framework that operates independently from the software, the researchers propose a solution that allows for offloading significant computational tasks onto the physical components, akin to how the human brain autonomously regulates functions like heartbeat without direct oversight.At present, the vast majority of robotic systems rely heavily on computer chips and electrical power to function effectively. This reliance not only limits their operational capabilities but also constrains their deployment in varied environments. The researchers' approach, however, could pave the way for a new generation of robots that are not only more adaptable and intelligent but also capable of functioning in diverse and resource-limited settings.The journey toward developing robots that can think and act with human-like awareness is still in its early stages, but the work being done at King’s College London provides a promising glimpse into a future where robots are not just machines, but entities that can engage with their environments in meaningful ways.","Researchers from King’s College London have proposed a groundbreaking approach that could make this vision a reality.

MakeMyTrip and Go First fined by consumer court as flight cancellation ‘ruined’ family's Thailand trip,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/makemytrip-and-go-first-fined-by-consumer-court-as-flight-cancellation-ruined-familys-thailand-trip/articleshow/114141615.cms,"What exactly happened

What MakeMyTrip and Go First say

Commission fines MakeMyTrip and Go First

MakeMyTrip and Go First airline have been fined Rs 19,000 by a District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission in Chandigarh. The penalty, Bar and Bench reports, was imposed following the disruption of a family’s trip to Thailand, caused by flight cancellations and rescheduling. Complainant alleges that multiple cancellations by airline resulted in the family missing their planned hotel stay.The complaint filed by a Chandigarh resident details how a vacation with his family in April 2023 was disrupted due to repeated changes to their flight schedule.He says that had booked tickets through MakeMyTrip for Go First's flight from New Delhi to Phuket in Thailand for April 1, 2023. He also booked accommodations in Krabi through MakeMyTrip for April 1.He explained that just weeks before their departure, Go First notified the complainant that the flight had been cancelled due to ""operational reasons"" and offered an alternative flight departing 3 hours and 40 minutes later. Eventually, the alternative flight was also cancelled, and a new rescheduled flight was provided for April 2, 2023.This, he said, resulted in the family missing their planned hotel stay in Krabi on April 1. He also lost a part of their prepaid booking in Phuket in addition to paying extra for extending their stay in Krabi. He argued that both MakeMyTrip and Go First are responsible for the inconvenience and financial loss he faced.Responding to the complaint, MakeMyTrip argued that, as a mere intermediary, it was not responsible for the disruptions caused by Go First. The company maintained that it only facilitated the booking process and had no control over airline operations or refunds, as outlined in their user agreement.Go First, on the other hand, failed to appear for the hearings, leading the case to proceed against them ex-parte.The commission stated that MakeMyTrip as the booking platform, could not completely absolve itself of responsibility. It cited the Consumer Protection (E-Commerce) Rules, 2020 which requires e-commerce platforms like MakeMyTrip to ensure that refunds and services are provided promptly.It further observed that Go First's failure to appear in court and its successive flight cancellations demonstrated negligence on the airline’s part, amounting to service deficiency. Accordingly, the commission has directed MakeMyTrip and Go First to jointly refund the complainant Rs 8,900 in addition to Rs 10,000 in compensation for the complainant's mental agony and litigation costs.","MakeMyTrip and Go First fined Rs 19,000 by District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission in Chandigarh.

Ratan Tata, my personal hero

I’m at a loss with Ratan Tata Sir’s passing. His loss feels so personal because it is for me. He was my hero growing up, like for so many others. I consider myself blessed to have gotten the opportunity to know my personal hero deeply over the last decade. Meeting and interacting with him many times and each time, learning lessons for life.

My relationship with Mr. Tata started in 2008. I was graduating from IIT Bombay and he was the guest speaker at our convocation. I was a young kid but his words that day stayed with me - to serve one’s country.

In 2015, I got the chance to meet Mr Tata and he decided to invest in Ola. But my interactions with him didn’t end there. They had just begun! Mr Tata was like no other business leader I have ever met. He took personal interest in my journey. And in every interaction there was grace, humility, curiosity and a world of learning for me. In 2016, I invited him to come to Bengaluru and address my whole company. I thought a person of his stature would politely decline but he actually took a full day out, flew to Bengaluru and spent the entire day with my team and company!

The one story I’d like to share today is his key role in the founding of my second company Ola Electric. One day in 2017 I got a call from him asking me to come to Mumbai. He just said - “Bhavish I want to take you somewhere and show you something exciting”. We flew in his plane to Coimbatore to see his personal project making electric vehicles out of the

Tata Nano

! He was so passionate and excited about electric vehicles. He even drove me in one on a test track and then pointed out such detailed improvements to the engineers. That was the day Ola electric really got started - as he ignited the passion for EVs and cars in me! After that, almost every product that we conceptualised and designed (some of which are not yet released) I would go and show him the concepts and he would patiently sit with me and ideate and give feedback.

His love for animals and dogs also grew on me. In fact, such was his love for dogs that many times when I went to his office, I would notice street dogs proudly sitting right there next to him inside his office! With this inspiration, we decided to open Ola offices and factories to stray dogs and today we have almost 30 of them living in our facilities.

The last time I met him was a year ago to share the news of Ola Electric’s IPO and he as usual was gracious and curious. He was frail but his enthusiasm for cars was as high as ever, and his encouragement for me was as strong as ever.

As I reflect on his legacy today, he has set a bar so high for all of us. And as I walk on my journey, make mistakes and learn from them, I feel so incredibly blessed to have seen such an amazing man from up close, and gotten a chance to see the ideal to strive for.

I will deeply miss him. India will deeply miss him. And there will be no one like him again.

Om Shanti🙏🏼

What the UP government’s order on 'Industry Status' for IT companies says

What industry status means for IT and ITES companies in UP

UP ranks No. 6 in software exports

The Uttar Pradesh government has officially recognized the information technology (IT) and IT-enabled services (ITES) sector as an ""Industry"". This new status allows IT companies in UP to acquire land at industrial rates from development authorities, aiming to make Noida more appealing to global tech giants. Additionally, new IT/ITES units consuming at least 150 kW of electricity will now benefit from industrial power tariffs.The state government expects this move to strengthen UP's position as a leading IT hub in North India.On October 4, Anil Kumar Sagar, the principal secretary (industry), issued an order instructing all industrial development authorities, the power department, and the housing and urban planning department to immediately recognize the sector as an industry. This policy is part of a broader government strategy to enhance facilities for the sector, including uninterrupted power supply, high-speed internet connectivity, and access to specialized IT parks. The government also plans to streamline land acquisition approvals and offer other incentives to reduce regulatory delays and operational costs.The order stated that this decision would not only attract more investments but also create a conducive environment for technology-driven businesses to thrive.'Industry status' means that the IT companies in UP will now be entitled to receive land at industrial rates from development authorities, which will be at a down cost, with which the state will hope to make Noida more attractive to global big tech.At present, land and electricity rates for IT/ITES plots are higher than that of industrial plots in areas under three industrial development authorities in Noida, even as they are allotted under institutional and industrial categories. IT plot prices in Noida, for instance, in the institutional category range from Rs 26,000 per sqm to Rs 73,220 per sqm. In the industrial category, IT plots are priced at Rs 37,340 per sqm, while industrial plot rates vary between Rs 28,000 per sqm and Rs 30,000 per sqm, depending on the location. With the industry status now in place, IT/ITES companies can benefit from the lower industrial rates. The difference between industrial and commercial power tariffs is around Re 1 per unit. While the industrial tariff is around Rs 7 per unit, IT companies currently pay Rs 8.30 per unit.Aiming for a $1 trillion economy within the next five years, the UP government has identified the IT sector as a key growth driver. The state is now recognized as an IT hub in North India, ranking sixth nationally in software exports . The sector encompasses a wide range of industries, including software services, BPOs, KPOs, and emerging technologies such as AI, gaming, and animation.Industry leaders have welcomed the move. Noida Authority CEO Lokesh M stated that the new policy would be presented to the Authority board for approval before its implementation.","The Uttar Pradesh government has officially recognized the information technology (IT) and IT-enabled services (ITES) sector as an 'Industry' This new status allows IT companies in UP to acquire land at industrial rates from development authorities, aiming to make Noida more appealing to global tech giants.

Why this Nobel prize winner and former Google employee hates ChatGPT and its founder Sam Altman,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-this-nobel-prize-winner-and-former-google-employee-hates-chatgpt-and-its-founder-sam-altman/articleshow/114129937.cms,"Why Geoffrey Hinton dislikes Sam Altman

'Godfather of AI' has warned of catastrophic impact of AI on humanity if left unchecked

Geoffrey Hinton , the renowned ""Godfather of AI,"" has publicly expressed concerns about Sam Altman 's leadership of OpenAI, criticizing Altman's focus on profits over safety. Hinton, Nobel Prize laureate in Physics, praised his former student, Ilya Sutskever , for playing a key role in Altman's temporary removal from OpenAI in November 2023.Hinton's concerns stem from his long-standing commitment to the ethical development of AI.In 2009, he demonstrated the potential of Nvidia's CUDA platform by training a neural network to recognize human speech, a breakthrough that contributed to the widespread use of GPUs in AI research. His research group at the University of Toronto continued to push the boundaries of machine learning, developing a neural network in 2012 that could identify everyday objects from images. This validated the use of GPUs in AI and spurred widespread adoption of neural networks powered by GPUs.Sutskever, a co-founder and chief scientist at OpenAI, played a pivotal role in shaping the organization's most advanced AI models. However, after OpenAI's board ousted Altman as CEO in late 2023, Sutskever initially supported the decision but later regretted it and joined others in advocating for Altman's reinstatement. Sutskever eventually left OpenAI in May 2024 to start his own AI venture, Safe Superintelligence Inc.Hinton, who supervised Sutskever during his Ph.D., reflected on OpenAI's original mission, which focused on ensuring the safety of artificial general intelligence (AGI). Over time, he observed a shift under Altman's leadership towards a profit-driven approach, a change Hinton views as detrimental to the organization's core principles.Beyond his critique of OpenAI, Hinton has long warned about the dangers AI poses to society. He has expressed concerns that AI systems, by learning from vast amounts of digital text and media, could become more adept at manipulating humans than many realize. Initially, Hinton believed that AI systems were far inferior to the human brain in terms of understanding language, but as these systems began processing larger datasets, he reconsidered his stance. Now, Hinton believes AI may be surpassing human intelligence in some respects, which he finds deeply unsettling.As AI technology rapidly advances, Hinton fears the implications for society. He has warned that the internet could soon be flooded with AI-generated false information, making it difficult for people to discern what is real. He is also concerned about AI's potential impact on the job market, suggesting that while chatbots like ChatGPT currently complement human workers, they could eventually replace roles such as paralegals, personal assistants, and translators.Hinton's greatest concern lies in the long-term risks AI poses, particularly the possibility of AI systems exhibiting unexpected behavior as they process and analyze vast amounts of data. He has expressed fears that autonomous AI systems could be developed to run their own code, potentially leading to the creation of autonomous weapons, or ""killer robots."" Once dismissing such risks as distant, Hinton now believes they are much closer than previously thought, estimating they could materialize within the next few decades.Other experts, including many of Hinton's students and colleagues, have described these concerns as hypothetical. Nonetheless, Hinton is worried that the current competition between tech giants like Google and Microsoft could spiral into a global AI arms race, one that would be difficult to regulate. Unlike nuclear weapons, AI research can easily be conducted in secret, making regulation and oversight much harder. Hinton believes that the best hope for mitigating these risks lies in collaboration among the world's top scientists to devise methods of controlling AI. Until then, he argues, further development of these systems should be paused.Hinton's concerns about Altman's leadership are not unique. Elon Musk, another co-founder of OpenAI, has been a prominent critic of Altman, particularly regarding OpenAI's transition from a nonprofit to a for-profit organization. Musk has repeatedly pointed out that this shift runs counter to the company's original purpose of being an open-source, nonprofit initiative to counterbalance other tech giants.As the AI race continues, Hinton's warnings underscore the growing divide between technological advancement and ethical responsibility, with OpenAI and its leadership at the center of this tension.","Geoffrey Hinton, the renowned ""Godfather of AI,"" has publicly expressed concerns about Sam Altman's leadership of OpenAI. Hinton praised his former student, Ilya Sutskever, for playing a key role in Altman's temporary removal from OpenAI in November 2023. He has long warned about the dangers AI poses to society.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114129948,imgsize-43982,width-400,resizemode-4/114129948.jpg"

India has cemented its position as the world's largest market for AI app adoption, contributing a significant 21% to the global total of over 2.2 billion AI app downloads in the first eight months of 2024. This surge, according to data from Sensor Tower , highlights India's growing embrace of AI-powered technologies.2023 was the year of explosive growth for global AI+Chatbot apps, with downloads increasing over 14 times on year to nearly 600 million.Chatbot apps like ChatGPT , Microsoft Copilot, and Google Gemini lead the charge in AI app downloads, followed closely by image/video editing and play apps in India. While most Indian users utilize these apps for free, North America and Europe contribute a substantial 68% of in-app purchase revenue for AI apps, which has surpassed $2 billion globally this year.Sensor Tower forecasts that total revenue from AI apps will reach $3.3 billion by the end of 2024, marking a 51% year-over-year increase. The year 2023 witnessed explosive growth for global AI+Chatbot apps, with downloads soaring over 14 times to nearly 600 million. In just the first eight months of 2024, these app downloads have already exceeded 630 million, surpassing the entire 2023 total. OpenAI 's ChatGPT app reigns supreme in terms of global downloads, followed by AI image editing app Remini. Photoroom AI Photo Editor and Google's Gemini also hold prominent positions.Neil Shah, partner and co-founder at Counterpoint Research, emphasized the growing popularity of consumer chatbots for generative purposes like text, image, and video creation. He also predicted significant adoption for simpler use cases like transcription, language translation, note-taking, summarization, and voice assistants.Looking ahead, Shah envisions a future where AI agentic systems, capable of operating autonomously, will create an ""app-less ecosystem"" powered by Google's Android OS and Apple's iOS. These AI agents can extract information, process data, and take actions on behalf of users, offering vast monetization opportunities through advertising.However, the increased AI usage on mobile devices necessitates innovation in faster processors and enhanced memory storage to deliver a truly seamless AI experience. Mini models require storage capacities of 4-5 GB, and device makers will need to provide at least 12 GB of RAM for AI apps and agentic workflows. While the device ecosystem is equipped to support AI in terms of compute and processing capabilities, thanks to NPU-powered chipsets from Qualcomm and MediaTek, memory remains a crucial factor.","2023 was the year of explosive growth for global AI+Chatbot apps, with downloads increasing over 14 times on year to nearly 600 million.

It can sense your movements, letting you snooze or turn off the alarm without pushing buttons. The clock plays music and sounds from five Nintendo games like Super Mario Odyssey , Splatoon 3, Legend of Zelda : Breath of the Wild, Pinkmin 4, and RingFit Adventure to wake you up.You can choose between two main alarm types. ""Steady Mode"" gets louder if you don't wake up quickly. ""Gentle Mode"" keeps the same volume for a calmer wake-up. Alarmo plays sound effects as you wake up, sort of cheering you up to get up from bed, and the moment you are up, the alarm will stop automatically.There are a total of 35 different wake-up scenes, seven from each game -- that combines the music and sound. It will get even more sounds later on, adding music from Mario Kart and Animal Crossing games.Alarmo does more than just wake you up. It can play soft game music to help you fall asleep. It also tracks how much you move while sleeping, showing this information in its Records section.Some fans were hoping for news about a new game console. Instead, they got this playful alarm clock. It's an unusual move for Nintendo, but lately Nintendo is trying things beyond just making video games and consoles. Last month, they opened aNintendo museum in Kyoto, Japan. Now, with Alarmo, they're bringing their games into people's daily lives in a new way, which could make waking up a little less miserable.Nintendo Switch Online members in the US and Canada can buy Alarmo now, before anyone else.
