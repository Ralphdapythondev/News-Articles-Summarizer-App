What the UP government’s order on 'Industry Status' for IT companies says

What industry status means for IT and ITES companies in UP

UP ranks No. 6 in software exports

The Uttar Pradesh government has officially recognized the information technology (IT) and IT-enabled services (ITES) sector as an ""Industry"". This new status allows IT companies in UP to acquire land at industrial rates from development authorities, aiming to make Noida more appealing to global tech giants. Additionally, new IT/ITES units consuming at least 150 kW of electricity will now benefit from industrial power tariffs.The state government expects this move to strengthen UP's position as a leading IT hub in North India.On October 4, Anil Kumar Sagar, the principal secretary (industry), issued an order instructing all industrial development authorities, the power department, and the housing and urban planning department to immediately recognize the sector as an industry. This policy is part of a broader government strategy to enhance facilities for the sector, including uninterrupted power supply, high-speed internet connectivity, and access to specialized IT parks. The government also plans to streamline land acquisition approvals and offer other incentives to reduce regulatory delays and operational costs.The order stated that this decision would not only attract more investments but also create a conducive environment for technology-driven businesses to thrive.'Industry status' means that the IT companies in UP will now be entitled to receive land at industrial rates from development authorities, which will be at a down cost, with which the state will hope to make Noida more attractive to global big tech.At present, land and electricity rates for IT/ITES plots are higher than that of industrial plots in areas under three industrial development authorities in Noida, even as they are allotted under institutional and industrial categories. IT plot prices in Noida, for instance, in the institutional category range from Rs 26,000 per sqm to Rs 73,220 per sqm. In the industrial category, IT plots are priced at Rs 37,340 per sqm, while industrial plot rates vary between Rs 28,000 per sqm and Rs 30,000 per sqm, depending on the location. With the industry status now in place, IT/ITES companies can benefit from the lower industrial rates. The difference between industrial and commercial power tariffs is around Re 1 per unit. While the industrial tariff is around Rs 7 per unit, IT companies currently pay Rs 8.30 per unit.Aiming for a $1 trillion economy within the next five years, the UP government has identified the IT sector as a key growth driver. The state is now recognized as an IT hub in North India, ranking sixth nationally in software exports . The sector encompasses a wide range of industries, including software services, BPOs, KPOs, and emerging technologies such as AI, gaming, and animation.Industry leaders have welcomed the move. Noida Authority CEO Lokesh M stated that the new policy would be presented to the Authority board for approval before its implementation.","The Uttar Pradesh government has officially recognized the information technology (IT) and IT-enabled services (ITES) sector as an 'Industry' This new status allows IT companies in UP to acquire land at industrial rates from development authorities, aiming to make Noida more appealing to global tech giants.

What Star Health has to say on probe in alleged role of senior company employee in data leak,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/what-star-health-has-to-say-on-probe-in-alleged-role-of-senior-company-employee-in-data-leak/articleshow/114130002.cms,"What the ‘hacker’claimed

“...operations remain unaffected”: Star Health after data leak

Star Health is currently investigating accusations against its chief information security officer, Amarjeet Khanuja , regarding a recent data breach , a report has said. A hacker known as xenZen , who claims to have sensitive customer data, including medical records and personal information, explicitly alleged that the executive ""sold all this data to me"".Citing Star Health, news agency Reuters reports that Khanuja has been co-operative in the company’s investigation into the leak. Reportedly, India's largest health insurer has said that their internal investigation has not yet uncovered any evidence to support these accusations.“Our CISO has been duly co-operating in the investigation and we have not arrived at any finding of wrongdoing by him till date,” Star said in a statement.According to the news agency, the self-styled hacker xenZen, who is disseminating the sensitive data of Star health’s of 3.2 crore customers through Telegram chatbots, claimed on his website that the executive had ""sold all this data to me"".The ‘leaked data’ contains full names, PAN numbers, mobile numbers, emails, date of birth, residential addresses, insured date of birth, gender, pre-existing diseases, policy numbers, health cards, nominee names, age, claims, nominee relationship, insured height, weight, BMI and more.Star Health Insurance has asserted that their operations are unaffected by the breach.“We make it absolutely clear that our operations remain unaffected, and all services continue without disruption. A thorough and rigorous forensic investigation, led by independent cybersecurity experts is underway, and we are working closely with government and regulatory authorities at every stage of this investigation, including by duly reporting the incident to the insurance and cybersecurity regulatory authorities, apart from filing a criminal complaint"".“We also want to emphasise that any unauthorised acquisition, possession, or dissemination of customer data is illegal.”Last month, Star Health sued Telegram and the hacker after it was reported that the hacker used chatbots on the messaging app to leak customer details. The hacker later set up websites that provided easy access to the data, the report said.","Star Health is currently investigating accusations against its chief information security officer, Amarjeet Khanuja.

High risk warning for Microsoft Edge users

The Indian Computer Emergency Response Team ( CERT-In ) has issued an advisory for Microsoft Windows users. The cyber security under the aegis of Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology said that it has discovered multiple vulnerabilities in Microsoft products including Microsoft Windows, Microsoft Office, Microsoft Azure, Developer Tools, and Microsoft SQL Server.In its advisory, CERT-in says that multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in Microsoft products which could allow an attacker to gain elevated privileges, bypass security restrictions, obtain sensitive information, conduct remote code execution attacks, or cause denial of service (DoS) conditions. The agency advises users to apply appropriate security updates .CERT-In has issued a second advisory related to Microsoft products this week. It has discovered multiple Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) with high severity warning. Vulnerability note is CIVN-2024-0316 M.Affected versions include Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) version prior to 129.0.2792.79. The vulnerability, CERT-In says can be exploited by a remote attacker to bypass security restrictions and execute arbitrary code on the targeted system.“These vulnerabilities exist in Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) due to insufficient data validation in Mojo, Inappropriate implementation in V8 and Integer overflow in Layout. A remote attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a specially crafted request to the targeted system,” it reads. “Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow a remote attacker to bypass security restrictions and execute arbitrary code on the targeted system,” it adds.",The Indian Computer Emergency Response Team ( CERT-In ) has issued an advisory for Microsoft Windows users.

Why this Nobel prize winner and former Google employee hates ChatGPT and its founder Sam Altman,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-this-nobel-prize-winner-and-former-google-employee-hates-chatgpt-and-its-founder-sam-altman/articleshow/114129937.cms,"Why Geoffrey Hinton dislikes Sam Altman

'Godfather of AI' has warned of catastrophic impact of AI on humanity if left unchecked

Geoffrey Hinton , the renowned ""Godfather of AI,"" has publicly expressed concerns about Sam Altman 's leadership of OpenAI, criticizing Altman's focus on profits over safety. Hinton, Nobel Prize laureate in Physics, praised his former student, Ilya Sutskever , for playing a key role in Altman's temporary removal from OpenAI in November 2023.Hinton's concerns stem from his long-standing commitment to the ethical development of AI.In 2009, he demonstrated the potential of Nvidia's CUDA platform by training a neural network to recognize human speech, a breakthrough that contributed to the widespread use of GPUs in AI research. His research group at the University of Toronto continued to push the boundaries of machine learning, developing a neural network in 2012 that could identify everyday objects from images. This validated the use of GPUs in AI and spurred widespread adoption of neural networks powered by GPUs.Sutskever, a co-founder and chief scientist at OpenAI, played a pivotal role in shaping the organization's most advanced AI models. However, after OpenAI's board ousted Altman as CEO in late 2023, Sutskever initially supported the decision but later regretted it and joined others in advocating for Altman's reinstatement. Sutskever eventually left OpenAI in May 2024 to start his own AI venture, Safe Superintelligence Inc.Hinton, who supervised Sutskever during his Ph.D., reflected on OpenAI's original mission, which focused on ensuring the safety of artificial general intelligence (AGI). Over time, he observed a shift under Altman's leadership towards a profit-driven approach, a change Hinton views as detrimental to the organization's core principles.Beyond his critique of OpenAI, Hinton has long warned about the dangers AI poses to society. He has expressed concerns that AI systems, by learning from vast amounts of digital text and media, could become more adept at manipulating humans than many realize. Initially, Hinton believed that AI systems were far inferior to the human brain in terms of understanding language, but as these systems began processing larger datasets, he reconsidered his stance. Now, Hinton believes AI may be surpassing human intelligence in some respects, which he finds deeply unsettling.As AI technology rapidly advances, Hinton fears the implications for society. He has warned that the internet could soon be flooded with AI-generated false information, making it difficult for people to discern what is real. He is also concerned about AI's potential impact on the job market, suggesting that while chatbots like ChatGPT currently complement human workers, they could eventually replace roles such as paralegals, personal assistants, and translators.Hinton's greatest concern lies in the long-term risks AI poses, particularly the possibility of AI systems exhibiting unexpected behavior as they process and analyze vast amounts of data. He has expressed fears that autonomous AI systems could be developed to run their own code, potentially leading to the creation of autonomous weapons, or ""killer robots."" Once dismissing such risks as distant, Hinton now believes they are much closer than previously thought, estimating they could materialize within the next few decades.Other experts, including many of Hinton's students and colleagues, have described these concerns as hypothetical. Nonetheless, Hinton is worried that the current competition between tech giants like Google and Microsoft could spiral into a global AI arms race, one that would be difficult to regulate. Unlike nuclear weapons, AI research can easily be conducted in secret, making regulation and oversight much harder. Hinton believes that the best hope for mitigating these risks lies in collaboration among the world's top scientists to devise methods of controlling AI. Until then, he argues, further development of these systems should be paused.Hinton's concerns about Altman's leadership are not unique. Elon Musk, another co-founder of OpenAI, has been a prominent critic of Altman, particularly regarding OpenAI's transition from a nonprofit to a for-profit organization. Musk has repeatedly pointed out that this shift runs counter to the company's original purpose of being an open-source, nonprofit initiative to counterbalance other tech giants.As the AI race continues, Hinton's warnings underscore the growing divide between technological advancement and ethical responsibility, with OpenAI and its leadership at the center of this tension.","Geoffrey Hinton, the renowned ""Godfather of AI,"" has publicly expressed concerns about Sam Altman's leadership of OpenAI.

India becomes the biggest market globally for these AI apps in 2024,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/india-becomes-the-biggest-market-globally-for-these-ai-apps-in-2024/articleshow/114129884.cms,"Name of most-popular AI apps in India

Chatbots for generative purposes like text, image, and video creation rule

India has cemented its position as the world's largest market for AI app adoption, contributing a significant 21% to the global total of over 2.2 billion AI app downloads in the first eight months of 2024. This surge, according to data from Sensor Tower , highlights India's growing embrace of AI-powered technologies.2023 was the year of explosive growth for global AI+Chatbot apps, with downloads increasing over 14 times on year to nearly 600 million.Chatbot apps like ChatGPT , Microsoft Copilot, and Google Gemini lead the charge in AI app downloads, followed closely by image/video editing and play apps in India. While most Indian users utilize these apps for free, North America and Europe contribute a substantial 68% of in-app purchase revenue for AI apps, which has surpassed $2 billion globally this year.Sensor Tower forecasts that total revenue from AI apps will reach $3.3 billion by the end of 2024, marking a 51% year-over-year increase. The year 2023 witnessed explosive growth for global AI+Chatbot apps, with downloads soaring over 14 times to nearly 600 million. In just the first eight months of 2024, these app downloads have already exceeded 630 million, surpassing the entire 2023 total. OpenAI 's ChatGPT app reigns supreme in terms of global downloads, followed by AI image editing app Remini. Photoroom AI Photo Editor and Google's Gemini also hold prominent positions.Neil Shah, partner and co-founder at Counterpoint Research, emphasized the growing popularity of consumer chatbots for generative purposes like text, image, and video creation. He also predicted significant adoption for simpler use cases like transcription, language translation, note-taking, summarization, and voice assistants.Looking ahead, Shah envisions a future where AI agentic systems, capable of operating autonomously, will create an ""app-less ecosystem"" powered by Google's Android OS and Apple's iOS. These AI agents can extract information, process data, and take actions on behalf of users, offering vast monetization opportunities through advertising.However, the increased AI usage on mobile devices necessitates innovation in faster processors and enhanced memory storage to deliver a truly seamless AI experience. Mini models require storage capacities of 4-5 GB, and device makers will need to provide at least 12 GB of RAM for AI apps and agentic workflows. While the device ecosystem is equipped to support AI in terms of compute and processing capabilities, thanks to NPU-powered chipsets from Qualcomm and MediaTek, memory remains a crucial factor.","2023 was the year of explosive growth for global AI+Chatbot apps, with downloads increasing over 14 times on year to nearly 600 million.

Nintendo surprised fans today by announcing not Switch 2 , but a $100 alarm clock, named Alarmo that brings Nintendo game sounds to your morning routine.Alarmo isn't just any alarm clock. It can sense your movements, letting you snooze or turn off the alarm without pushing buttons. The clock plays music and sounds from five Nintendo games like Super Mario Odyssey , Splatoon 3, Legend of Zelda : Breath of the Wild, Pinkmin 4, and RingFit Adventure to wake you up.You can choose between two main alarm types. ""Steady Mode"" gets louder if you don't wake up quickly. ""Gentle Mode"" keeps the same volume for a calmer wake-up. Alarmo plays sound effects as you wake up, sort of cheering you up to get up from bed, and the moment you are up, the alarm will stop automatically.There are a total of 35 different wake-up scenes, seven from each game -- that combines the music and sound. It will get even more sounds later on, adding music from Mario Kart and Animal Crossing games.Alarmo does more than just wake you up. It can play soft game music to help you fall asleep. It also tracks how much you move while sleeping, showing this information in its Records section.Some fans were hoping for news about a new game console. Instead, they got this playful alarm clock. It's an unusual move for Nintendo, but lately Nintendo is trying things beyond just making video games and consoles. Last month, they opened aNintendo museum in Kyoto, Japan. Now, with Alarmo, they're bringing their games into people's daily lives in a new way, which could make waking up a little less miserable.Nintendo Switch Online members in the US and Canada can buy Alarmo now, before anyone else. Other people will have to wait until next year to get one (and also for the Switch 2).","Alarm clock plays music and sounds from five Nintendo games to wake you up.

How this outage affected users



Thousands of TSB customers across the UK have been facing disruptions as the bank's mobile app and online banking services experienced widespread outages. Reports of login failures and difficulties accessing accounts began flooding as the banks’ online services left many customers unable to manage their finances. According to a report by The Standard, customers have complained that during the outage they were unable to make payments, check balances and manage their daily banking needs.In a post on social media platform X (earlier Twitter), TSB has assured customers that their money remains safe and that it is working to resolve the issue as quickly as possible.TSB Bank , which serves over five million customers and operates more than 220 branches across the UK, has acknowledged the issue and is working to restore services. This latest disruption adds to a series of recent technical challenges faced by the bank, raising concerns about the reliability of its digital platforms.According to Down Detector UK, more than 2,000 issues were reported at one point earlier today. However, the reports have gone down with time.TSB customers have taken to social media to reveal how they were affected during the recent outage. As per their reports, the outage left them unable to access their accounts and make payments. Some users even mentioned that the timing of the outage was poor as they urgently needed to manage their finances.“The @TSB app is down or being updated more times than it is working,” wrote one user.Another added: “Well done @TSB on my payday of all days when I need to pay all my bills I can’t. Because you’ve decided to mess about with the app and I can’t approve payments. Cheers.”In some cases, the app suggested that users don’t have accounts at all.

“Hello Deepinder, in Bengaluru South, we've taken few key measures to better the working conditions of delivery executives.

When we set up a resting point for delivery partners at the Vega City Mall in June 2023, we ensured that they have convenient access to the mall & are able to enjoy a break during the wait for the order.

With essential amenities such as first-aid, drinking water, and clean restrooms, the point provides a place for all delivery partners to rest, rejuvenate, and recharge. We were the first to do this in Bengaluru South, understanding the daily struggles that delivery partners go through.

Also happy to inform that under the MPLADS, we set up the first resting point for wheelchair delivery partners outside the MP office in Jayanagar. Here, we welcome delivery partners and provide them drinking water, restrooms & mobile charging points.

We will further work on building such spaces for the benefit of gig workers in Bengaluru South, making it a model for the rest of the country.”

We find things that make people want to come to office: Berg



New hirings may remain low at Spotify

Spotify 's chief human resources officer, Katarina Berg recently said that work is not a place you come to, it’s something you do, reiterating the company’s work-from-anywhere (WFA) policy. In an interview with Raconteur, Berg said that while she understands why some companies have returned to the office, she is yet to find a reason to enforce a mandate for Spotify’s employees.“We are a business that’s been digital from birth, so why shouldn’t we give our people flexibility and freedom?” she said. “You can’t spend a lot of time hiring grown-ups and then treat them like children,” Berg added.“It is harder and we all struggle to collaborate in a virtual environment,” she said. “But does that mean that we will start forcing people to come into the office as soon as there is a trend for it? No.”“People who work here tend to love music,” Berg said, further adding” “We try to find things that make people want to come into the office rather than forcing them to.”Spotify encourages its employees to meet in person during what it calls ‘core week’. During this time, each team is expected to come together to collaborate and discuss strategy. “By having one week where small teams travel to meet up, we can energise people and still have a low impact on the climate,” Berg said. “It has worked really well.”Spotify has retained its office space, but is reportedly looking to downsize its real estate footprint. Part of this is due to mental-health and wellbeing concerns. “We know what happens when people sit down and you can actually look each other in the eye. It’s different to being on screen,” Berg explained. “Some people like to come into the office and meet people.”Berg emphasised that Spotify’s work from anywhere policy has a positive effect on retention rates too. Attrition rates dropped by 15% following its decision to allow employees to work from anywhere. IThe Stockholm-based company announced 1,500 job cuts last year, reducing its total headcount by 17%. “It wasn’t pleasant to do but it was a business decision,” Berg said. “We wanted to mature and we need to become a great business as well as a great product. We had to say goodbye to people that had done really well for us.”She further stated that although Spotify has not implemented a hiring freeze, recruitment will likely remain in the “lower numbers” in the near future. “Being a people-first organisation doesn’t shield you from macroeconomics,” she added.","Spotify's chief human resources officer, Katarina Berg, said that work is not a place you come to, it's something you do.
