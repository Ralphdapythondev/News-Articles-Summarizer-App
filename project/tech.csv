How EU is going after Apple, Facebook and Microsoft

Apple:

Google:

Facebook parent Meta:

Microsoft:

European regulators and some national watchdogs in France, Italy, Spain and Germany are taking a tough stance on Big Tech companies like Apple, Google , Meta (formerly Facebook ) and Microsoft . In the latest move, the European Commission charged that Apple breached EU tech rules, known as the Digital Markets Act (DMA). It announced a new probe into the iPhone maker's contractual terms. With this, Apple becomes the first company to be charged under EU's new rules. Here's a breakdown of the recent actions against technology companies:The EU introduced the DMA in September 2023 to create a fairer digital market. Companies like Google, Apple, Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft were designated as ""gatekeepers"" under the DMA, meaning they have to follow stricter rules. These rules aim to make it easier for users to switch between different tech services and platforms.EU regulators are investigating Apple's App Store practices for potentially breaching DMA rules by restricting app developers. Meta and Google are also under investigation for possible DMA violations.The EU is investigating Apple's App Store rules and its new contractual terms for app developers. Apple was previously fined for favoring its own apps over competitors.The EU has already fined Google billions of euros in the past for antitrust issues. Several EU countries have also fined Big Tech companies for various concerns, including data privacy and unfair business practices.The EU is investigating Meta's decision to phase out its misinformation tracking tool CrowdTangle and potential breaches of child safety rules on Facebook and Instagram. Meta was also fined inItaly for unfair commercial practices.The EU is investigating Microsoft for potentially tying its Teams app with its Office suite and hindering competition from other security software providers. Microsoft might face charges in this case. A group representing more than 700 startups in Spain issued a complaint about Microsoft's cloud practices to the country's antitrust regulator in May, citing several allegedly anti-competitive practices in recent years.","Apple becomes the first company to be charged under EU's new rules.

Apple‚Äôs success in automating iPhone production



Apple is reportedly planning to shift its iPhone production process towards automation . The Cupertino-based tech giant has allegedly told its managers to ‚Äúreduce the number of workers on iPhone final assembly lines by as much as 50% over the next few years.‚ÄùAccording to a report by The Information, Apple‚Äôs senior vice president of operations, Sabih Khan , has issued an order for iPhone factory workers in China.The report cited two former employees who claimed that the order instructed the company‚Äôs managers to reduce the number of workers on iPhone final assembly lines by as much as 50% over the next few years.As per the report, Apple made this decision shortly after violent clashes between iPhone workers and police outside of Foxconn ‚Äôs primary assembly plant in China in November 2022.To reduce its overall headcount, Apple is reportedly moving forward with supply chain and production automation projects that it ‚Äúhad previously mothballed due to high up-front costs.‚ÄùThe report also notes that Apple has recently some companies including DarwinAI that have helped the company‚Äôs supply chain automation efforts. Last year, the iPhone maker also reportedly acquired a company called Drishti which analyses video footage of assembly lines to ‚Äúidentify bottlenecks and production problems in real-time.‚ÄùFor iPhone 16, Apple initially planned to automate the process of installing iPhone buttons and other components, the report claimed. However, these plans were later cancelled ‚Äúbecause of the high rate of defects.‚ÄùThe machinery needed to automate iPhone production is expected to cost the company hundreds of millions each year. In some cases, Apple reportedly pressured manufacturing partners to make this investment up-front with varying degrees of success.As per data published by Apple in its annual supply chain reports (seen by 9to5Mac), ‚Äúthe total number of employees it monitors at its manufacturing partners for work-hour compliance‚Äù fell from 1.6 million in 2022 to 1.4 million in 2023.The report also adds that there was a ‚Äúsignificant amount of automation‚Äù in the final assembly of the iPhone 15 and much of this work is led by Apple‚Äôs operations vice president Peter Thompson .",Apple reportedly told managers to reduce the number of workers on iPhone final assembly lines by as much as 50% over the next few years.

I've worked hard, for my entire career, to keep my life balanced with my job. In my book, I write about my Tuesday date nights with my wife. For over thirty years, I had a hard cut-off on Tuesdays. Rain or shine, I left at exactly 5 pm and spent the evening with my best friend. We would go to a movie, have dinner, or just go window-shopping downtown together.

Nothing got in the way of that. No meeting, no conference call, no last-minute question or request. If you had something to say to me on Tuesday afternoon at 4:55, you had better say it on the way to the parking lot. If there was a crisis, we are going to wrap it up by 5:00.

Those

Tuesday nights

kept me sane. And they put the rest of my work in perspective.

I resolved a long time ago to not be one of those entrepreneurs on their 7th startup and their 7th wife. In fact, the thing I'm most proud of in my life is not the companies I started, it's the fact that I was able to start them while staying married to the same woman; having my kids grow up knowing me and (best as I can tell) liking me, and being able to spend time pursuing the other passions in my life.

That's my definition of success.

Marc Randolph, co-founder of Netflix and 6 other companies, has shared his ‚Äúdefinition of success‚Äù, saying that Tuesday night dates with his wife helped him along his career and maintain a balance between work and personal life.In a post shared on X, the 66-year-old entrepreneur said that he did not attend any meetings, conference calls, last-minute questions or requests. Randolph noted his strict adherence to this rule on Tuesdays and ‚Äúany crisis had to be wrapped up by 5 pm.‚Äù","Marc Randolph, co-founder of Netflix and 6 other companies, has shared his ‚Äúdefinition of success‚Äù, saying that Tuesday night dates with his wife helped him along his career and maintain a balance between work and personal life.

AI focus and restructuring at Infosys, HCLTech and Wipro

Indian IT service providers like Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), HCLTech , Wipro , and Tech Mahindra have restructured their businesses and leadership teams in the past year, as the $250 billion software services export industry faces a slowdown in demand due to technology and market disruptions, a report says.According to a report by The Economic Times, the IT companies are building new capabilities by reorganising units focused on generative artificial intelligence ( Gen AI ). Additionally, they have improved their digital expertise through acquisitions and new structures.For example, TCS CEO K Krithivasan, appointed last year, regrouped existing industry solution units into key business groups. The company also merged its AI and cloud businesses into a single AI.Cloud unit under Siva Ganesan.Moreover, there has been shuffling of global heads as TCS brought in new senior executives in various verticals and geographies.The company TCS also created the Enterprise CBO (cognitive business practices) unit, which is focused on enterprise functions such as finance and accounting, to be led by Ashok Pai. Enterprise CBO also includes AI-driven human-machine collaboration platform, TCS Cognix.Other homegrown firms like Infosys, HCLTech and Wipro established dedicated Gen AI divisions to integrate AI and Gen AI across various functions and industries.Infosys, the second-largest player after TCS, revamped its organisational structure to pursue new Internet of Things (IoT) opportunities. As per CEO Salil Parekh , the company has ‚Äúalready internally switched to an AI first company.‚Äù‚ÄúOne big capability that is standing out right now, which is horizontal and its expertise works across industries, is Gen AI.

The company has also tweaked leadership roles in software, product, and engineering verticals.Wipro consolidated operations in the Nordics and Benelux regions. Tech Mahindra, under new CEO Mohit Joshi, reduced its sales structure from 12 to 6 strategic business units.","Indian IT service providers like Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), HCLTech, Wipro, and Tech Mahindra have restructured their businesses and leadership teams in the past year.

Melinda stepped from Gates foundation after the divorce

Bill Gates divorced his ex-wife Melinda French Gates in 2021. Years later, Melinda French Gates has opened up about her divorce with the Microsoft co-founder. In an interview with Time Magazine recently, she described the end of 27-years marriage as ‚Äòa painful and horrible experience‚Äô.‚ÄúGetting a divorce is a horrible thing. It‚Äôs just painful. It‚Äôs awful when you realize you need one,‚Äù she said. Although later she corrected horrible to hard, but added that things are wonderful now that it‚Äôs over.During the interview, Melinda Gates also talked about how getting divorced in a pandemic helped the couple get privacy. ‚ÄúIt gave us the privacy to do what needed to be done in private,"" she told Time.She also reflected on being able to navigate the process while taking care of children. ‚ÄúYou know, I separated first before I made the full decision about a divorce. And to be able to do that in private while I‚Äôm still trying to take care of the kids, while still making certain decisions about how you‚Äôre going to disentangle your life - thank God,"" she said.The divorce led her to step away from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in May this year, three years after the divorce. During the interview, she told Time that she thought about the effect of divorce on the foundation.""I thought a lot about my three children. But I certainly thought about the effect on the foundation. Those are the three biggest buckets: me, the kids, and the foundation. And I wanted to make sure that when we came through it to the other side - all of those pieces were intact.‚ÄùMelinda also explained that she does not see her decision to exit the foundation as ‚Äòdownsizing‚Äô. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see it honestly as a downsizing ...I was just ready to be able to have full decision-making control about where all the funds go,‚Äù she said.","Melinda French Gates has opened up about her divorce with the Microsoft co- founder.

However, the company‚Äôs big AI push may face some challenges in China as regulators have in place strict rules around the technology amid tough competition.The three challenges that the company may face in China are (via CNBC):China‚Äôs AI market is tightly regulated and all companies launching AI models must have approval from the regulators for the commercial use of LLMs. The country has also made it mandatory for Generative AI providers to take down ‚Äúillegal‚Äù content.Since some of the features of Apple Intelligence are developed by the company itself, Apple will likely need to get its AI model approved by authorities under Chinese rules.China has also banned OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT. Some of Apple‚Äôs voice assistant Siri‚Äôs capabilities are dependent on ChatGPT. This could mean that Apple may have to find a local AI company that provides the same level of capabilities as ChatGPT.

Their new system, Private Cloud Compute, processes user data on Apple-owned servers, with the company claiming the data itself is not stored.However, in China, Apple's iCloud data is stored on servers located locally and operated by a third party.

India's largest IT services company Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is facing a significant challenge filling a massive number of open positions. During a town hall earlier this month, the global operations head of TCS ' resource management group (RMG) Amar Shetye revealed that the company currently has thousands of open positions that it is not able to fill due to the skills gap.Shetye put the number at 80,000. For those unaware, the RMG team at TCS is responsible for allocation of available resources to various projects across the company and in case of any shortfall, fill such requirements through contractors. These contractors are on the roles of the hiring agencies and may or may not be hired as permanent staff by the company.The reason for the skills gap is said to be a mismatch between the skills possessed by employees and those their roles demand.An employee who attended the townhall anonymously told TOI, ""We were told that either skillsets or employee aspirations are not matching project requirements. However, at TCS, no associate is forced to take on a project if they are not comfortable with it.""""He told us that we should consider ourselves fortunate that the firm is not laying off employees for not being mapped to any project unlike other firms,"" another employee on the bench added.The company‚Äôs recent annual report revealed that 33% of job requirements are currently being met by grooming existing talent.Post the announcement of fourth quarter results, TCS CEO K Krithivasan said that the company has built one of the largest artificial-intelligence-ready workforces in the world.

This means that HDFC Bank customers will receive SMS alerts for UPI transactions exceeding Rs 100 when sending money and similar notification for when received is above Rs 500. However, the bank will continue to send email alerts for all transactions with no absolutely change.In a mail as well as SMS alert sent to its customers, HDFC Bank said: ‚ÄúStarting from 25th June, 2024: Email Alerts: Continue to receive email alerts for all UPI transactions. SMS Notifications: Now only for transactions above Rs 100 (money sent/paid) and Rs 500 (money received).‚ÄùThis change aligns with banking norms, which require text messages for transactions over Rs 5,000. Despite this, many banks send alerts for lower-value debits as well. HDFC Bank stated that feedback indicated alerts for low-value transactions were deemed 'not useful,' as there is often duplication of notifications from UPI payment apps.Bankers noted that bulk text messages cost between Rs 0.01-0.03 each. With UPI transactions averaging around 40 crores per day, banks collectively spend several crores daily on text message alerts.Banks are also promoting the use of UPI Lite for transactions up to Rs 500. UPI Lite allows a small amount of money to be set aside by the app, facilitating quick payments without the need for second-factor authentication.By reducing the frequency of low-value transaction alerts, HDFC Bank and others aim to streamline notifications for customers while also cutting costs.

Apple is expected to launch its next-gen iPhone 16 series models in September. However, rumours and speculations related to the upcoming iPhones are already making the rounds on the internet. Now, a new leak suggests that the iPhone 16 may get a major design overhaul.In a post shared on the social media platform X (earlier Twitter), a tipster named Ice Universe shared a video showing the alleged case of the upcoming iPhone 16.The leaked case reveals that the upcoming iPhone 16 may have a vertical rear camera setup, similar to the one that was last seen on iPhone 12.The new case design also reveals a new cutout at the right side of the phone which may house a dedicated camera shutter button for the iPhone 16 Pro models.The dedicated shutter button which is expected to come powered by the company‚Äôs haptic engine is rumoured to join the existing physical buttons. This button may use a soft tap for focus and a double tap/hard press for capture, offering an improved camera experience.This alignment will reportedly enable spatial video recording capabilities similar to iPhone 15 Pro which has two cameras stacked vertically while the third camera is arranged diagonally.However, the latest rumours contradict earlier reports that suggested that the iPhone 16 may arrive with a buttonless design.The leaked case also suggests that Apple may be adding more buttons alongside the volume and power controls. The customisable ""Action"" button, which was introduced in iPhone 15 Pro, may also make a return in iPhone 16.
