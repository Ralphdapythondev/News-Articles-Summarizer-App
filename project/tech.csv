Intel has ‘Nvidia-like plan’ for selling AI chips in China,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/intel-has-nvidia-like-plan-for-selling-ai-chips-in-china/articleshow/109351454.cms,"Nvidia to launch three AI chips for Chinese markets

US-based chipmakers are developing AI chips for the Chinese market that are comparatively less powerful than the ones they sell to big tech companies like Google, Microsoft and Facebook parent Meta as a way to keep their business running while complying with US export controls and sanctions. Nvidia has done it in the past and Intel is planning to do the same.Citing a white paper by Intel, a report by the Register said that Intel will release two AI chips with reduced capabilities for the Chinese market later this year. The two chips, which may be called HL-328 and HL-388, are scheduled for launch in June and September, respectively.These Intel China-specific AI chips are based on the company's latest Gaudi 3 product line, which was unveiled on April 9. The chips for the Chinese market are said to have similar hardware features, including on-chip memory, high-bandwidth memory, and interface standards.However, to comply with the export control regulations, the performance of the chips will be significantly reduced. The report highlighted that the Intel chips are expected to perform similarly to Nvidia's H20 – the fastest GPU that the company has to offer and approved for sale in China.Meanwhile, news agency Reuters reported that Nvidia also has plans for three China-specific chips after the US last year further tightened a rule, capping the capabilities of AI chips that can be shipped to China.The Nvidia H20 chips are reported to be delivered in small batches in the first quarter of 2024, with larger quantities expected from the second quarter.","Intel will release two AI chips with reduced capabilities for the Chinese market later this year.

Chinese couple abandons baby with nanny for USD 55 million inheritance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/chinese-couple-abandons-baby-with-nanny-for-usd-55-million-inheritance/articleshow/109346851.cms,"NEW DELHI: A Chinese couple left their baby with a nanny for 400 million yuan (USD 55 million) and later vanished, leaving the caregiver owed 110,000 yuan (US$15,000).Hailing from Harbin, Heilongjiang province, in northeastern China, the couple abandoned their five-month-old child under the care of a hired nanny, failing to fulfill their financial commitments to her.This incident sparked intense debate online, with many speculating that the couple might not be the biological parents and that maybe they have used the child as part of a fraudulent scheme , South China Morning Post reported.The couple, allegedly, claimed they were on the brink of receiving a substantial sum from the wife's deceased former partner. However, they disappeared without a trace, leaving the nanny without payment for her services for several months, during which she even lent them 50,000 yuan.The nanny, surnamed Yu, claimed, ""I gave them all my savings, but since November last year, I haven’t received my salary. They owe me and the money I borrowed from my brother. Without any income, I’m still caring for their child.""She presented evidence of financial transactions with the couple through WeChat. She stated that the couple claimed that they were in Tianjin which is quite perplexing. Yu further added they went to claim the inheritance left by the child's mother's boyfriend from a decade ago.In a bid to win the nanny's confidence, the couple displayed screenshots they claimed depicted their impending inheritance, showcasing gold, luxury timepieces, and safety deposit boxes.Additionally, they presented her with a photograph of a property ownership certificate, purportedly for a hotel in Harbin's Daowai district, which they asserted would soon belong to them. Convinced by this ""evidence,"" she extended them another 8,000 yuan in loan.However, upon attempting to contact the hotel using a phone number she found online, the staff denied knowledge of her employers' names. Closer scrutiny of the property certificate photo revealed alterations in the text, as per the South China Morning Post.Despite multiple attempts to reach her employers via phone and WeChat, all efforts have been futile, leaving the nanny unable to recover her losses.The nanny's predicament has ignited a fervent online debate, with many advising her to report the incident to the authorities, suspecting she may have fallen victim to an elaborate scam.","A Chinese couple left their baby with a nanny for 400 million yuan (USD 55 million) and later vanished, leaving the caregiver owed 110,000 yuan (US$15,000) The nanny, surnamed Yu, claimed, ""I gave them all my savings, but since November last year, I haven’t received my salary""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109348320,imgsize-36376,width-400,resizemode-4/109348320.jpg"

How AI could revolutionize prediction of deadly dust storms in Asia,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/how-ai-could-revolutionize-prediction-of-deadly-dust-storms-in-asia/articleshow/109321279.cms,"NEW DELHI: With spring's arrival in the Northern Hemisphere, parts of Asia are once again grappling with the annual menace of dust storms , which have recently shrouded regions like China's Inner Mongolia in a thick yellow haze. On March 27, 2024, residents of Erenhot, Inner Mongolia, witnessed their skies turn murky, with state media advising people to stay indoors as winds whipped up dust with speeds reaching 100 kilometers per hour, reducing visibility to less than 90 meters.This persistent problem has prompted significant scientific engagement, particularly from Chinese researchers who have been at the forefront of developing forecasting systems for these potentially deadly natural phenomena.The latest advancements involve the application of artificial intelligence ( AI ) and climate modeling aimed at improving the accuracy and timeliness of dust storm predictions, a report in science journal Nature said.Chen Siyu, an atmospheric scientist at Lanzhou University, detailed the impact of dust storms, noting, “The dust and wind can combine to create massive, fast-moving walls of dust that travel a great distance.” These storms are not just vast curtains of dust; they also carry bacteria and toxic metals, posing serious health and environmental hazards. In fact, during such events, mortality from cardiovascular diseases can surge by 25%, and respiratory problems by 18%.Chen's team at Lanzhou University has developed an early-warning system named the Dust Watcher, utilizing AI to predict the timing and severity of incoming dust storms up to 12 hours in advance across 13 Asian countries. “AI can learn how dust storms evolve in time and space from a large amount of data,” explained Huang Jianping, a distinguished professor at the university. In a trial run, the Dust Watcher achieved 13% fewer errors compared to non-AI models.Despite the challenges of forecasting, innovations like the Dust Watcher are proving to be crucial. Wang Zifa, an atmospheric physicist at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, emphasized the severe effects of dust storms in East Asia due to the region’s dense population. The efforts to refine these predictions are continuous, with Jin Jianbing from Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology developing a 48-hour forecast system that integrates observational data dynamically to enhance prediction accuracy, the Nature report said.The relationship between climate change and dust storms adds another layer of complexity. While some studies suggest that climate phenomena like Arctic amplification might reduce dust levels by altering wind patterns, others indicate changing climate conditions could exacerbate the situation. Gao Meng, a co-author of a recent study, highlighted the delicate balance climate change plays in influencing dust storm patterns.","Dust storms have recently shrouded regions like China's Inner Mongolia in a thick yellow haze.

'No need for cell towers': China has revolutionised smartphone communications,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/no-need-for-cell-towers-china-has-revolutionised-smartphone-communications/articleshow/109246416.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a landmark achievement for satellite communications , Chinese scientists have developed the world's first satellite capable of enabling smartphone calls directly, without the need for ground-based infrastructure. Named ""Tiantong,"" which translates to ""connecting with heaven,"" the initiative draws inspiration from the biblical story of the Tower of Babel, aiming to bridge communication gaps rather than create them.The Tiantong-1 satellite series, which began with its first launch on August 6, 2016, now includes three satellites in a geosynchronous orbit at 36,000km, covering the entire Asia-Pacific region.This breakthrough came to fruition when Huawei Technologies released the world’s first smartphone supporting satellite calls in September of the previous year, leading the way for other manufacturers like Xiaomi, Honor, and Oppo to follow suit, a South China Morning Post report said.These technological advancements have proven invaluable, particularly in emergency situations where traditional communication networks are compromised. For instance, during the 6.2-magnitude earthquake in Gansu province on December 18, affected individuals could maintain contact with the outside world thanks to the satellite call function available on their smartphones.“Direct satellite connectivity for mobile phones has become a new development trend, and satellite communication will gradually become popular among the general public,” noted a team led by Cui Wanzhao from the China Academy of Space Technology. Their work, detailed in the Aerospace Science and Technology journal, highlights the overcoming of significant technical challenges related to passive intermodulation (PIM), which can degrade the quality of satellite calls.By addressing the PIM issue, the team has enabled exceptionally sensitive reception capabilities in the Tiantong satellites, allowing them to pick up signals from standard smartphones without the need for external antennas. This capability is critical, especially given the satellites' exposure to extreme temperature variations and their operation across multiple frequency bands.The idea for such a satellite came about after 2008, when Sichuan, a province in southwestern China, was struck by a devastating magnitude-8 earthquake, resulting in the tragic loss of over 80,000 lives.What made the situation far worse back then was the communication breakdowns in affected areas, which in turn severely hindered rescue operations, thus compounding the crisis.In response to this disaster, the Chinese government started the Tiantong Project, a satellite communication system. The purpose of the satellite is to provide universal access to communication services irrespective of socio-economic status.China's advancements in this field are securing its position as a leader in satellite communication technology globally, heralding a new era where geographic isolation no longer equates to communication isolation.","Chinese scientists have developed the world's first satellite capable of enabling smartphone calls directly.

Summer vacations are about the start and if you are planning a holiday with your family and friends, it is important to be aware of airport rules regarding carrying your gadgets with you. Understanding these regulations can help save you from unexpected bumps at airports, while checking-in as well as through security checks.Power banks, batteries or battery-operated devices can’t be in the check-in luggage.Most airlines and airports require these items to be carried in your carry-on luggage rather than checked baggage. However, you can take out the batteries from the device, keep the device in the check-in luggage and carry the battery separately in the carry-on luggage. Additionally, power banks with more than 20000mAh or 100Whr capacity aren’t allowed on the flights.During airport security, it is important to take out your laptop, smartphone and other electronic devices for the screening process. Users are required to take out these devices and put them in a tray along with their charging cables.Note that some specific laptops and smartphones are banned by airlines for carrying. This includes Samsung Galaxy Note 7 and 15-inch MacBook Pro sold between September 2015 and February 2017.Airports and airlines allow users to carry smartwatches during the flight without any issue in the carry-on, but travellers are required to take them out during the security check process.If you are travelling with TWS earbuds, headphones or portable speakers, you will also need to take them out for screening during the security check. Do note that some airports and airlines ask travellers to take out the charging cables too.Electric shavers and razors are allowed by airlines to be carried in both carry-on and checked baggage. However, traditional razor blades and disposable razors with removable blades are only permitted in checked-in bags if they meet specific size and quantity requirements.If you are planning to carry your professional camera gear with big lenses, tripods, etc, you may need to go through a separate screening process. However, if the entire item can get inside checked-in luggage (without the batteries) or hand luggage, then the screening process may not be required.Electronic cigarettes are illegal in India and you can’t carry them with you to the airport. If you are found carrying one, it can be confiscated and lead to legal issues for you.If you're planning to travel with a drone, familiarise yourself with the regulations of your destination country as well as any restrictions imposed by airlines. Some countries have strict rules governing the use of drones, and failure to comply could result in confiscation or legal consequences. Also, airlines may require you to procure additional permissions to be able to carry it.Also, a drone less than 250 gm in weight can be carried in the checked-in (with batteries removed) or cabin luggage. Bigger ones will require proper permission to carry.Electric lighters are not allowed in hand luggage as well as checked-in baggage.","Airports and airlines allow users to carry smartwatches during the flight without any issue in the carry-on.

Best captions for Instagram post; here's the list,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/social/captions-for-instagram-post/articleshow/109346909.cms,"Instagram Captions: What are they and how can you improve them

Tips for Captivating Captions for Instagram

Leverage Hashtags: Instagram, while not inherently viral, allows you to connect with more than just your followers. To broaden your reach, integrate relevant hashtags into your captions. Keep in mind that you have the flexibility to include up to 30 hashtags per post.

Tag Your Account: Encourage users to explore your profile further by tagging your own account. This not only increases profile clicks but also extends the time users spend interacting with your content. Use the format “@username” in the caption field to tag others.

Emoji Power: Emojis aren’t just a trend; they add personality and emotion to your captions. Choose the right emoji to enhance the meaning of your Instagram posts and make them more appealing.

Put on your positive pants.

Like yourself and dream big dreams.

I'm not here to fit in. I'm here to stand out

My attitude is a mix of confidence and sass

I'm the architect of my own attitude

Confidence is my best accessory

Hate me or love me, either way, I'm still on your mind

I'm not a second option; I'm a priority or nothing at all

Attitude is everything; it's the lens through which I see the world

I may not be perfect, but my attitude is impeccable

I'm not trying to be everyone's cup of tea. I'm my own double-shot espresso

I'm not chasing anyone; I'm too busy chasing my dreams

Confident Captions for Instagram

Confidence is my superpower

Be a voice, not an echo

I'm the CEO of my own life

Confidence looks good on you

I'm not perfect, but I'm perfectly confident

Confidence is not arrogance; it's belief in oneself

I'm not afraid of storms because I'm learning to sail my own ship

Life is too short to blend in

I don't need your validation; I've got my own

Confidence is the best outfit; rock it and own it

Self-confidence is the best accessory I wear every day

Believe in yourself, and the world will believe in you

I'm not a backup plan; I'm a first choice

Confidence is not about being better than others; it's about being your best self

Confidence is preparation. Everything else is beyond your control.

Beauty is an attitude. Inhale confidence, exhale doubt.

Smile, for everyone lacks self-confidence, and more than anything else, a smile reassures them.

Nothing is more beautiful than a confident woman. Be your own kind of beautiful.

A woman is unstoppable after she realises she deserves better.

Embrace your flaws; they make you unique and beautiful

Being positive in a negative situation isn’t naive. It’s leadership.

Always believe that something wonderful is about to happen.

Positive anything is better than negative nothing.

Think positive, be positive.

Life changes very quickly in a very positive way if you let it.

Never stop doing your best just because someone doesn’t give you credit.

Being negative only makes a difficult journey more difficult.

Consistent Brand Voice: Maintain uniformity in your brand's personality and tone across all captions. Whether your brand exudes wit, information, or motivation, ensure your captions reflect this identity.

Grab Attention Early: Place crucial words at the outset of your caption. Even if users skim, they'll grasp the main message.

Strategic Hashtags: Use relevant hashtags judiciously to enhance reach and engagement. Avoid overcrowding your captions; limit yourself to 5-7 tags per post.

Encourage Interaction: Pose questions in your captions to foster engagement. Encourage followers to comment, share their thoughts, and actively engage with your content.

Clear Call to Action: Direct your audience toward specific actions—whether it's liking the post, following your account, or visiting a link. A well-defined call to action prompts users to act on your caption.

Tips to write a perfect caption for Instagram

Keep it Concise: Aim for approximately 125 characters or fewer to ensure your caption is easily digestible and encourages interaction.

Incorporate Emojis: Emojis can add a playful element to your captions, but use them judiciously and appropriately.

Stay Genuine: Share personal anecdotes, reflections, and experiences to forge deeper connections with your audience.

Inject Humour: Humorous captions can capture attention and evoke smiles, but always be mindful of cultural sensitivities.

Use User-Generated Content (UGC): Encourage your followers to contribute content related to your brand, and feature it in your posts to cultivate a sense of community.

Collaborate with Influencers: Partnering with influencers can broaden your reach and introduce fresh perspectives to your content strategy.

Our iPhones go everywhere with us, so it shouldn’t come as a surprise that they collect dust, dirt and grime. The good news is that keeping your iPhone clean is easy, and essential for its lifespan and performance. But you must be careful as some common cleaning habits can damage your device. Even though newer iPhones are water-resistant, submerging them or cleaning them directly with liquids is a big no-no.Here's what to avoid when cleaning your iPhone:Before getting on with the cleaning process, you should plan how to clean the device. Here’s a list of products that will help you clean your iPhones:You can clean your iPhone case separately since it's more durable than the phone. These covers are usually not that expensive to replace if damaged. For cleaning iPhone cases, it’s better to follow the manufacturer's instructions. However, if there’s no such information available, take out the iPhone from the case and the warm, soapy water to remove dirt from the case's cutouts. Allow the case to dry before reattaching it to the phone.Handle the iPhone’s screen with the utmost care, as it's the most fragile part of your device. Apple applies an oleophobic coating to repel finger oils, so only use water to clean it. Avoid abrasive or grease-cutting cleaners, as they will damage the coating. Use a soft microfibre cloth dampened with water and wipe the screen in one direction to remove dirt and grease from the screen.If your iPhone is charging slowly, the charging port may be clogged with debris like lint or paper bits. Apple advises against using compressed air to clean it. Instead, gently scrape the port with a SIM eject tool or a toothpick wrapped with cotton. Check with a light to ensure it's clean.Another common reason for improper iPhone charging is a dirty or damaged Lightning or USB-C cable. Dirt can accumulate on the cable's contacts to restrict proper charging. Before cleaning, disconnect the cable from both ends. Use a damp cloth to wipe the connector until it's clean and shiny. Ensure the connector is completely dry before reusing. Also, inspect the cable for any signs of damage or wear.iPhone's speaker and microphone are located at the bottom, beside the charging port, making it a challenging area to clean. Avoid using compressed air, as it may damage your device or its water resistance. Instead, gently scrub the area with a fine, soft toothbrush to loosen dirt, being careful not to apply too much pressure.Many iPhone models have a Ring/Silent switch on the left edge (Action Button in the latest iPhone 15 Pro series), which can also collect dirt and become hard to clean, especially with certain cases. If you rarely use this switch and it's full of dirt, use a fine toothpick to scrape out the grime. Flip the switch back and forth to clean both sides. If needed, use a fine-point cotton swab with a small amount of isopropyl alcohol, but be cautious not to get alcohol on the screen or other sensitive parts, as it can damage protective coatings.For older iPhones with a physical Home button, maintaining its cleanliness is crucial. Consider carrying a soft, lint-free cloth for regular cleaning, as a clean button is essential for the Touch ID fingerprint reader to function properly. Clean the button weekly or as frequently as you clean your screen to ensure optimal performance.For iPhone models equipped with Face ID, the notch or Dynamic Island cutout at the screen's top contains various sensors. A greasy screen can affect their performance. If you notice Face ID is slow to unlock your iPhone, cleaning the sensor array can improve its functionality. Simply wipe it with the same microfibre cloth you use for the rest of the screen.Similar to the Home button and sensor array, the front and rear cameras can also accumulate grease. To determine if the lens cover is dirty, inspect the Camera app's viewfinder for signs such as light streaks, blown-out highlights, foggy previews, or difficulty focusing. Regularly wipe the lens glass with a soft, damp microfibre cloth to address these issues.",Cleaning your iPhone clean is essential for its lifespan and performance. Clean the Home Button weekly or as frequently as you need to. Clean your iPhone’s camera lens with a soft microfibre cloth dampened with water and wipe the screen in one direction.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109349896,imgsize-1755782,width-400,resizemode-4/109349896.jpg"

The AI Factor

Android is set to grow at ""twice the pace of iOS "" in 2024, according to research director Nabila Popal from the International Data Corporation (IDC). This is because Apple 's iPhone sales dropped by 10% in the first quarter of 2024, allowing Samsung to reclaim the top spot in the global smartphone market.The IDC's report highlights the changing dynamics in the smartphone industry, with Android poised to make a strong comeback after several years of decline.Popal told CNN, ""It's also very significant that Samsung is back at the top. This year, we are expecting Android to grow at twice the pace of iOS."" This projection is based on the fact that Android has more room for growth after experiencing a steep decline in recent years.Apple's loss of momentum can be attributed to several factors, including increased competition, nationalism, and a challenging economic environment in China, one of the company's most important markets outside the United States. Despite Apple's efforts to boost sales through discounts in China, consumers increasingly turn to national brands such as Huawei , Xiaomi, and OPPO/OnePlus.The IDC report also notes that while Apple and Samsung are expected to maintain their hold on the market, the resurgence of Chinese manufacturers will likely continue. Huawei, in particular, made headlines last year with its Mate 60 smartphone, which featured a sophisticated processor that shocked industry experts given the U.S. government's efforts to restrict China's access to foreign chip technology.As the smartphone market recovers in 2024, with a strong emphasis on AI, Samsung appears to be in a favourable position to capitalise on this growth. Popal stated, ""As the overall smartphone market recovers this year, with a strong focus on AI, Samsung is in good position to grow further this year."" So, artificial intelligence (AI) is going to be a major factor contributing to Android's growth.Samsung has made significant strides in this area, emphasising AI advancements in its latest Galaxy S24 lineup for messaging, photos, and games. In contrast, Apple has yet to articulate a strong message about AI, which could impact consumer interest in its products.","Android is set to grow at ""twice the pace of iOS "" in 2024, according to research director Nabila Popal from the International Data Corporation.

However, the report doesn’t confirm if the company will directly integrate Google’s Gemini or any other chatbot into iOS 18.As per the report, Apple may offer some of its own cloud-based generative AI features in the coming days.

Other camera upgrades coming to iPhone 16 Pro models

Apple is reportedly testing a new atomic layer deposition (ALD) technology to apply anti-reflective coatings to the camera lenses of future iPhone models, potentially reducing lens flare and ghosting artefacts in photos, according to a rumour from a source within Apple's supply chain.The rumour, posted by user ""yeux1122"" on the Korean blog Naver, suggests that the new manufacturing process could be applied to at least one of the Pro models in the upcoming iPhone 16 series, expected to launch in September.However, given the timing of the rumour, it is also possible that this technology is being tested for the iPhone 17 Pro models slated for release in 2024.ALD technology allows for precise control over the thickness and composition of materials deposited onto a substrate, enabling the application of extremely thin layers of anti-reflective coatings onto camera components. These coatings can help reduce photographic artefacts such as lens flare, which appears as streaks of light, and ghosting, characterised by faint secondary images in the photo when a bright light source shines directly into the lens.In addition to improving image quality, ALD-applied materials can also provide protection against environmental damage to the camera lens system without compromising the sensor's light-capturing ability.The iPhone 16 Pro models are rumoured to feature several camera upgrades, including a tetra prism lens with up to 5x optical zoom , a feature currently exclusive to the iPhone 15 Pro Max. Both Pro models may also receive a new 48MP ultrawide camera, further enhancing their photographic capabilities.Apple typically launches its new iPhone lineup in mid-September, and as the event approaches, more leaks and rumours are likely to surface, giving us more details about what to expect from iPhone 16 series.","Rumour claims Apple is testing new anti-reflective coating technology.

Microsoft has finally resolved a major Windows 11 bug that prevented Windows 10 users from upgrading to the latest version of Windows. The issue surfaced due to an Intel driver conflict . The tech giant, as per Windows Latest report, has now lifted the upgrade block on affected PCs, allowing those users to make the jump to Windows 11.The issue, first flagged in November 2021, caused recurring Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) errors for Windows 10 PCs running Intel's 11th-generation Core processors with specific versions of the Intel SST driver (10.29.0.5152 or 10.30.0.5152).To prevent the problem, Microsoft enforced a compatibility block preventing those systems from upgrading to Windows 11.After over a year, Microsoft has updated the bug's status to ""resolved"" on its health dashboard. The only fix was for users to manually update to the latest compatible Intel SST driver version from the manufacturer's website before attempting the Windows 11 upgrade – a cumbersome process for many.Now, Microsoft will offer the latest Intel driver through Windows Update, after which affected users should see the option to upgrade to Windows 11 within 48 hours.For those who don't receive the driver update automatically, Microsoft recommends contacting the device's manufacturer for the compatible version.The resolution comes as Microsoft continues to struggle to convince users to adopt Windows 11. As of March 2024, Windows 10 remains the dominant operating system with 69.2% market share according to StatCounter, while Windows 11 lags far behind at just 26.71% adoption despite an 8% year-over-year increase.While it is a good thing that Microsoft has finally fixed the long-known bug and allowed stuck Windows 10 users to upgrade to Windows 11. However, this does not change the system requirements for the Windows 11 operating system. This means nothing has changed for the unsupported Windows 10 devices.","Microsoft has finally resolved a major Windows 11 bug that prevented Windows 10 users from upgrading to the latest version of Windows.

"Microsoft tests ads in Windows 11 Start menu, here’s what it means for users",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/laptops-pc/microsoft-tests-ads-in-windows-11-start-menu-heres-what-it-means-for-users/articleshow/109256421.cms,"Microsoft has begun testing advertisements within the Windows 11 Start menu. The company is experimenting with displaying promoted apps in the ""Recommended"" section, which echoes its previous attempts to integrate ads into its operating system .Currently limited to Windows Insiders in the Beta Channel within the United States , the ads should help users discover apps from the Microsoft Store , says Microsoft.By placing promoted apps alongside recently installed and frequently used programs, Microsoft hopes to increase exposure for its store offerings.While the promoted apps can be disabled through the Settings app, some users argue that this adds to the growing list of toggles and settings that need to be adjusted to achieve a clean, ad-free Windows 11 experience. The lack of a clear ""Promoted"" label next to the app name has also raised concerns about transparency, as users may not immediately realise that they are being presented with an advertisement rather than a personally relevant recommendation.Microsoft is seeking feedback on the changes, suggesting that the company may be open to modifying or removing the feature based on user response. The Windows Insider team has stated that the experiment will not apply to commercial devices managed by organisations, perhaps acknowledging the potential for disruption in professional settings.Critics of the move argue that Microsoft should focus on refining the Start menu's functionality and customization options rather than using it as a vehicle for advertising. Some have pointed out that the company already has ample opportunities to showcase its store offerings through the Microsoft Store app itself, as well as through other channels such as email newsletters and targeted online ads.Microsoft has a history of incorporating ads into its Windows operating system, with previous versions featuring promotional spots on the lock screen and Start menu. The company even briefly tested ads within the File Explorer of Windows 11 last year before turning off the experiment due to negative feedback from users. This latest move to introduce ads in the Windows 11 Start menu has reignited concerns about the creeping commercialization of the user interface.","Microsoft has begun testing ads within the Windows 11 Start menu.

The Computer Emergency Response Team ( CERT-in ) has issued a warning for users of various Microsoft products including Windows 10, Windows 11 and Microsoft Office . The cybersecurity watchdog has reported security bypass vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows products that could be exploited by the attacker to compromise the targeted system.The agency, which comes under the Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology, classified the vulnerability as ‘critical’ on the severity scale.“Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in Microsoft Windows which could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code, bypass security features, and compromise the targeted system,” Cert-In said.As per the agency, the vulnerabilities exist due to improper access restrictions within the proxy driver and insufficient implementation of the Mark of the Web (MoW) feature in Microsoft Windows.“The SmartScreen security feature protection mechanism bypasses the Mark of the Web (MotW) feature and allows malware to execute on a target system. The threat actors may exploit these vulnerabilities by sending specially crafted request,” it added.The products include -- Microsoft Windows, Microsoft Office, Developer Tools, Azure, Brower, System Center, Microsoft Dynamics, and Exchange Server.The agency advised users to apply appropriate security updates as mentioned in the company's update guide.Earlier this year, CERT-in issued a warning for users of Windows 10 and Windows 11 users, saying a vulnerability in Microsoft Windows Kernel that could be exploited by the attacker to gain elevated privileges on the targeted system.It classified the vulnerability – spotted in both 32-bit and x64-based systems – as ‘high’ on the severity scale. It said the vulnerability exists in Microsoft Windows Kernel due to a flaw in the Kernel component.","The Computer Emergency Response Team ( CERT-in) has issued a warning for users of various Microsoft products including Windows 10, Windows 11 and Microsoft Office.

Microsoft to Windows 10 users: It may be time to upgrade,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/laptops-pc/microsoft-to-windows-10-users-it-may-be-time-to-upgrade/articleshow/109226897.cms,"Microsoft has begun displaying full-screen prompts to Windows 10 users , urging them to upgrade to Windows 11 or purchase a new PC as the end of support date for Windows 10 approaches. The prompts, reading ""A new journey with Windows...,"" appeared after the recent Patch Tuesday updates, shown to users with PCs that are ineligible for the Windows 11 upgrade due to hardware requirements.The full-screen prompt thanks users for their loyalty to Windows 10 and warns them about the approaching end of life (EOL) date. It also encourages users to learn more about transitioning to a new Windows 11 PC. Notably, the prompt does not allow permanently dismissing the message.Users with Windows 10 PCs that do not meet the hardware requirements for Windows 11 have two options to remain secure beyond the EOL date: purchase a new PC with Windows 11 or pay Microsoft for extended security updates (ESU) on Windows 10. While pricing for ESU has not been revealed for individual users, business customers will have to pay $61 per device for the first year, with the cost doubling each subsequent year.Microsoft's decision to use full-screen prompts to encourage upgrades is not unprecedented. The company employed similar tactics during the transition from Windows 7 to Windows 10 nearly five years ago. While some users may find the prompts intrusive, Microsoft believes it is essential to inform users about the upcoming end-of-support date and the available options to maintain the security of their devices.The slower uptake of Windows 11 compared to its predecessor can be attributed to the more stringent hardware requirements, which include CPUs released from 2018 onward and devices that support TPM security chips integrated into the latest CPUs. As a result, many users decide to either upgrade their hardware or continue using Windows 10 with the understanding that they will need to pay for extended security updates after October 2025.Windows 10 is set to reach its end of support on October 14, 2025, after which users will no longer receive critical security and bug fix updates, leaving their PCs vulnerable to newly discovered security exploits.Microsoft has not clarified whether the full-screen prompts will appear more than once or if users should expect regular notifications over the next 18 months. The company has also not provided details on ESU pricing for consumers, although it has mentioned that schools will be offered significant discounts.","Microsoft has begun displaying full-screen prompts to Windows 10 users urging them to upgrade to Windows 11.

Sony PS5 Pro: Sony's ray-tracing 'message' to game developers for PS5 Pro,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/gaming/sonys-ray-tracing-message-to-game-developers-for-ps5-pro/articleshow/109343926.cms,"Sony PS5 Pro model: What to expect



Sony is expected to launch a more powerful PS5 console by the end of 2024. According to a report by The Verge, a full list of specs for the upcoming console has been leaked. The repot also cited sources familiar to Japanese gaming major’s plans to reveal that the company has also asked developres to ensure that their games are compatible (mainly for improved ray-tracing) with the rumoured console.As per the report, Sony is encouraging developers to use graphics features like ray tracing more with the PS5 Pro .The company also reportedly noted that games will be able to use a “Trinity Enhanced” (PS5 Pro Enhanced) label if they “provide significant enhancements.”The report claims that Sony is developing this model under the codename Trinity . The PlayStation 5 Pro model is expected to include a more powerful GPU and a slightly faster CPU mode.This suggests that the PS5 Pro may likely be far more capable of rendering games with ray tracing enabled and may even offer higher resolutions and frame rates in certain titles.The report also claimed that Sony’s documents outlining the upcoming console expects GPU rendering on the PS5 Pro to be “about 45 percent faster than standard PlayStation 5.”The PS5 Pro GPU is likely to be larger and may use faster system memoryto help improve ray tracing in games, the report added. Sony is also expected to use a “more powerful ray tracing architecture” in the PS5 Pro. For this, the Pro model is expected to offer speeds up to three times better than the regular PS5.Unlike the GPU, the CPU that will be used in the Pro model will be the same as the standard PS5 but will arrive with a new mode that clocks it higher.In a document to developers (seen by The Verge), Sony said: “Trinity has a mode that targets 3.85GHz CPU frequency,” which will be around 10 percent more than the regular PS5. Sony will also allow developers to choose between a “standard mode” at 3.5GHz or the “high CPU frequency mode” at 3.85GHz.Apart from this, the PS5 Pro will include some changes to system memory for developers. The standard PS5 memory runs at 448GB/s, but for PS5 Pro, Sony is increasing this up by 28% to 576GB/s.The company is also likely to offer developers more access to overall system memory. Sony may allow games to use an additional 1.2GB of system memory on the PS5 Pro. This means developers will be able to use an overall memory of 13.7GB compared to the 12.5GB allocated to games on the base PS5.Sony claims that, “Trinity is a high-end version of PlayStation 5.” The company also indicated that it will continue to sell the standard PS5 after the launch of this new model.Sony is reportedly expecting game developers to offer a single package that will support both the PS5 and PS5 Pro consoles. For this, the company has asked developers to patch existing games for higher performance.Test kits for the upcoming model are available for developers. Sony also wants every game submitted to certification in August to be compatible with the PS5 Pro.Rumours suggest that the Pro variant of the console is expected to release during the 2024 holiday period.",Sony is expected to launch a more powerful PS5 console by the end of 2024.
