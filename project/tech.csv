Researchers on how China may be closing AI gap with the US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/researchers-on-how-china-may-be-closing-ai-gap-with-the-us/articleshow/112083299.cms,"China bets on open-source software for AI development

Researchers and technologists have said that China is rapidly catching up to the US in the race for artificial intelligence (AI) development with a growing emphasis on open-source technology , a report has said.According to the New York Times, Chinese companies are sharing their AI advancements , including underlying code, through open-source platforms, allowing for faster collaboration and innovation within the global AI community .Recently at the World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai, a video was shown wherein an old photograph of a woman with two toddlers came to life with the use of AI technology similar to Sora – created by ChatGPT-maker OpenAI .While Sora is not available for the public, the technology by Chinese companies are available to the general public.“My American friends still can’t use Sora. But we already have better solutions here,” the co-founder of the startup that made the AI video was quoted as saying.As per Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and technologist who helped build Chinese offices for both Google and Microsoft, and who co-founded 01.AI start-up, said that his company’s chatbot technology scored nearly as well as the leading American technologies on common benchmark tests that rate the performance of the world’s chatbots.“We have disproved the commonplace belief that China doesn’t have the talent or the technology to compete with the US. That belief is simply wrong,” Dr. Lee said.Chinese companies are readily sharing their AI advancements, including underlying code, through open-source platforms. This allows for faster collaboration and innovation within the global AI community.“Chinese companies are good at replicating and improving what the U.S. already has. They are not as good at inventing something completely new that will bypass the U.S. in five to 10 years,” said Yiran Chen, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Duke University.Recently, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg pointed out that open-source AI software is beneficial for both the developers and the company. Clément Delangue, chief executive of Hugging Face also said that open-source AI is the foundation of AI development. He said that the US built its leadership in AI through collaboration between companies and researchers, “and it looks like China could do the same thing.”","Chinese companies are readily sharing their AI advancements, including underlying code, through open-source platforms.

"UK, EU question Elon Musk’s X over use of data to train Grok AI: What they said",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/uk-eu-question-elon-musks-x-over-use-of-data-to-train-grok-ai-what-they-said/articleshow/112082799.cms,"Also Read:

How X’s auto-consent flouts tech rules in the UK, EU

Elon Musk-owned X recently enabled by default a setting that allows the social media platform to utilise user data to train its AI model, Grok. This means X can use user posts, interactions, and outputs from Grok for training and refining its AI, requiring users to manually opt-out. Now the regulators in the UK and the European Union ( EU ) have reportedly connected with the company over its alleged attempt to gain user consent for data harvesting without their approval.While X claims this data is essential for improving user experience, privacy concerns have been raised. The setting states that users “allow your posts as well as your interactions, inputs and results with Grok to be used for training and fine-tuning”.Users have expressed difficulty in disabling this feature as the option is currently hidden within the web app's settings and unavailable on the mobile app.The move contradicts the tech laws in both the regions as the regulations prohibit pre-ticked consent boxes. Tech companies are not allowed to use “pre-ticked boxes” or “any other method of default consent”.Data protection authorities in the UK and Ireland have expressed their concerns over X's actions, as per a report by the Guardian. The UK's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) is investigating the matter, emphasising the importance of transparency and user choice in data usage.“Platforms seeking to use their users’ data to train their AI foundation models must be transparent about their activities,” said a spokesperson for the ICO.“They should take steps to proactively notify users well in advance of using data for these purposes, and provide people with ample time and simple processes to object to having their data used in this way,” the spokesperson added.Similarly, Ireland's Data Protection Commission (DPC), the lead regulator for X in the EU, has expressed surprise at the development and is seeking further information from the company.“The DPC has been engaging with X on this matter for a number of months, with our latest interaction occurring as recently as yesterday, therefore we are surprised by today’s developments. We have followed up with X today (July 26) and are awaiting a response. We expect further engagement early next week,” said Graham Doyle, a DPC deputy commissioner.","X recently enabled by default a setting that allows the social media platform to utilise user data to train its AI model, Grok.

Google fixes this ‘dangerous’ security flaw that allowed hackers to bypass email verification,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-fixes-this-dangerous-security-flaw-that-allowed-hackers-to-bypass-email-verification/articleshow/112082721.cms,"‘Fixed problem within 72 hours’

Google has said that it has fixed a security flaw that allowed hackers to bypass the company’s Email Verification to create potentially malicious Workspace Accounts and access third-party services.“In the last few weeks, we identified a small-scale abuse campaign whereby bad actors circumvented the email verification step in our account creation flow for Email Verified (EV) Google Workspace accounts using a specially constructed request,” a notice sent by Google to some users read.“These EV users could then be used to gain access to third-party applications using ‘Sign In with Google’,” it added.In response to questions by known independent journalist Brian Krebs (via KrebsOnSecurity ), Google said it fixed the problem within 72 hours of discovering it. Anu Yamunan, director of abuse and safety protections at Google Workspace, said that the malicious activity began in late June.As per the company, “a few thousand” Workspace accounts were created without being domain-verified. Google has added additional detection to protect against these types of authentication bypasses.“The tactic here was to create a specifically-constructed request by a bad actor to circumvent email verification during the signup process,” Yamunan was quoted as saying.“The vector here is they would use one email address to try to sign in, and a completely different email address to verify a token. Once they were email verified, in some cases we have seen them access third party services using Google single sign-on,” she said.As per Yamunan, no potentially malicious workspace accounts were used to abuse Google services.",Google has said that it has fixed a security flaw that allowed hackers to bypass the company’s Email Verification to create potentially malicious Workspace Accounts. ‘A few thousand’ Workspace accounts were created without being domain- verified.

Their companies, Tesla and Meta, have had heightened tensions, particularly after Meta launched Threads, a text-based conversation app, in July 2023. This led X to send a cease-and-desist letter to Meta, accusing it of using Twitter’s trade secrets and other intellectual property improperly.Interestingly, Musk’s challenge came just a day after he praised Zuckerberg for Meta’s new AI model, Llama 3.1.

“PhonePe was born in Bengaluru and we are incredibly proud of our roots in this city, which is well known for its world-class technology talent and vibrant diversity. From Bengaluru, over the past decade we have expanded across the length and breadth of India and been able to deliver secure and efficient digital payments for over 55 Crore Indians.

Bengaluru's reputation as the ""Silicon valley of India"" is truly well-deserved. The city thrives on an incredible culture of innovation, and attracts the most brilliant young minds from Karnataka and the rest of India. As a company, we are deeply grateful for the supportive business environment that Karnataka’s governments and its local

Kannadiga

populace have offered us. Without such an inclusive ecosystem and progressive policies, Bengaluru would not have become a global technology superpower.

As a company we also thrive on celebrating diversity, we have always tried hard to deliver fair, unbiased and meritocracy-based employment opportunities for all Indians - including to all local Kannadigas. We believe such an approach gives every Indian a good job a chance to shine, and ultimately helps create more societal and economic value for Bengaluru, Karnataka and India.

I read some recent media articles, relating to a few personal comments that I made last week regarding the draft job reservation bill. I would first and foremost like to clarify that it was NEVER my intention to insult Karnataka and it’s people. If my comments hurt anyone’s sentiments in such a way, I am truly sorry and would like to offer you an unconditional apology. I have the highest regard for Kannada, and all other Indian languages. In fact, I truly believe that linguistic diversity and rich cultural heritage is a national asset that all Indians should be proud of; and all Indians should be respectful of and celebrate local and cultural norms.

Bengaluru’s Indian startups are competing against trillion dollar giants like Google, Apple, Amazon and Microsoft. To do so, these companies must be able to employ the very best talent available in India purely based on their technology skills and proficiency in fields such as Coding, Design, Product Management, Data Sciences, Machine Learning, AI and beyond. As a nation, that is the only way we can build world-class companies that can compete in the global village that we live in today.

I also want to help create lakhs of jobs for Bengaluru and Karnataka. And, I believe with more dialogue and discussion, we can find ways to create more sustainable employment avenues. Let’s all work together to do this meaningfully and while creating long-term impact.”

PhonePe CEO Sameer Nigam issued a personal note following backlash over his comments on Karnataka 's job reservation bill. The controversy erupted after Nigam criticised the bill on social media platform X, questioning whether his children deserved jobs in their home city given his company's pan-India job creation.""If my comments hurt anyone's sentiments, I am truly sorry and would like to offer you an unconditional apology,"" Nigam said in a statement.He emphasised his 22-year connection to Bengaluru and respect for linguistic diversity.The Karnataka Cabinet had recently approved a bill mandating 50% reservation for locals in management roles and 70% in non-management positions within private companies. The bill, which also proposed 100% quota for locals in certain government jobs, was put on hold after industry backlash.Nigam stressed the need for merit-based hiring to build globally competitive companies. He reaffirmed PhonePe's commitment to Karnataka, stating the company plans to create thousands of new jobs in the state.",PhonePe CEO Sameer Nigam issued a personal note following backlash over his comments on Karnataka's job reservation bill.
