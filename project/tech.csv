TikTok accused of spying on US users' views on abortion and these 'sensitive topics',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/tiktok-accused-of-spying-on-users-views-on-abortion-and-these-sensitive-topics/articleshow/112070975.cms,"The US Justice Department intensified its scrutiny of TikTok this week, alleging that the popular video-sharing platform collected sensitive data on American users and was influenced by its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, in content moderation decisions.According to court filings, TikTok tracked user views on topics like gun control, abortion, and religion, raising concerns about potential national security risks .The Justice Department's accusations came in response to TikTok's lawsuit challenging a new law that could force the app's sale or ban in the U.S. unless ByteDance divests its ownership.The department claims to have discovered a software tool enabling U.S. employees of TikTok and ByteDance to gather user information based on content, including views on sensitive subjects. Furthermore, intelligence reports suggest ByteDance has complied with Chinese government demands to censor content outside of China.TikTok has consistently denied these allegations, emphasizing its commitment to user privacy and security. The company has invested heavily in a project to store U.S. user data domestically, but the Justice Department argues this is insufficient to address the risks posed by TikTok's ties to China.A key point of contention is the revelation that TikTok employees shared sensitive U.S. user data with colleagues in China using ByteDance's internal communication system, Lark. This data transfer, according to the Justice Department, undermines TikTok's claims of data security.The Wall Street Journal previously reported that TikTok tracked users who watched gay content and that employees within the company's special Project Texas unit sometimes shared sensitive user data with colleagues outside the unit.As the legal battle unfolds, the future of TikTok in the U.S. remains uncertain. While several billionaires have expressed interest in acquiring the platform, ByteDance has ruled out a sale. With millions of young Americans using TikTok, the outcome of this case will have significant implications for both the technology industry and national security.","US Justice Department claims TikTok collected sensitive data on American users and was influenced by its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, in content moderation decisions.

Although the company provided credits to most affected advertisers, the class action sought damages for a broader group of advertisers.The settlement now requires approval from a federal judge. If approved, advertisers who purchased LinkedIn ads between 2015 and 2023 may be eligible for compensation.LinkedIn has emphasized its commitment to ad integrity and providing a trusted platform for its users.","The settlement, filed in a California federal court on Thursday, alleges that LinkedIn inflated the number of people who watched video ads by counting views even when videos played off-screen.

"C-DOT teams up with IIT, Roorkee and Mandi to make 'Cell-Free 6G access points': What they mean for telecom companies",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/c-dot-teams-up-with-iit-roorkee-and-mandi-to-make-cell-free-6g-access-points-what-they-mean-for-telecom-companies/articleshow/112070314.cms,"What are 'Cell-Free 6G access points'

The Centre for Development of Telematics ( C-DOT ), the telecom R&D centre of the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), has signed an agreement with the Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee ( IIT Roorkee ) and Indian Institute of Technology, Mandi ( IIT Mandi ), for the development of ‘Cell-Free’ 6G Access Points . Both the IITs are collaborating to develop this technology.The agreement is signed under the Telecom Technology Development Fund (TTDF) scheme of Department of Telecommunications, Government of India, which has been designed to provide funding support to domestic companies, Indian startups, academia and R&D institutions involved in technology design, development, commercialization of telecommunication products and solutions.This scheme aims to enable affordable broadband and mobile services, playing a significant role in bridging the digital divide across India.Traditional mobile networks use cellular topologies in which each cell is serviced by a single base station like 4G/5G to service mobile customers. ‘Cell-Free’ Massive MIMO (multiple-input and multiple-output) eliminates the idea of cells and cell boundaries by deploying several access points (APs) across a vast region to serve many user devices at the same time. A large number of APs are dedicated to each user within their coverage area, meaning a single user may be supported by many Aps. This ensures ubiquitous connectivity to the users, eliminates dead zones, enhances signal strength, and significantly boosts data speeds, offering an exceptional user experience even in densely populated areas.This 6G project will focus on developing APs for enabling the upcoming 6G radio access networks and also aims to contribute to the 6G standardization activity, drive commercialization, generate intellectual property rights (IPRs), and develop a skilled workforce to support the emerging 6G landscape.The agreement was signed during a ceremony attended by CEO, C-DOT - Dr Rajkumar Upadhyay, principal investigator – Dr Abhay Kumar Sah from IIT Roorkee, co-investigator – Dr Adarsh Patel from IIT Mandi and Director C-DOT, Dr Pankaj Kumar Dalela.At the event, Dr Sah and Dr Patel affirmed their dedication to advancing next-generation communication technologies, aligning with Bharat 6G Vision launched by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi. They expressed their gratitude to Department of Telecommunications (DoT) and C-DOT for the opportunity to collaborate on this research, emphasizing that it bolsters efforts to enhance cutting-edge research capabilities and infrastructure in the telecom sector.Dr Rajkumar Upadhyay, CEO, C-DOT underscored the key role of indigenously designed & developed technologies in meeting the specific requirements of communication for our diverse country, reaffirming the commitment towards “Atmanirbhar Bharat”. He also said this will help us generating IPRs in 6G domain and emerging technologies in the area of 6G.The C-DOT, IIT-Roorkee & IIT-Mandi representatives expressed their enthusiasm and commitment to this collaborative endeavour on developing and shaping the 6G vision of India.","‘Cell-Free’ Massive MIMO eliminates the idea of cells and cell boundaries by deploying several access points (APs) across a vast region.

Their companies, Tesla and Meta, have had heightened tensions, particularly after Meta launched Threads, a text-based conversation app, in July 2023. This led X to send a cease-and-desist letter to Meta, accusing it of using Twitter’s trade secrets and other intellectual property improperly.Interestingly, Musk’s challenge came just a day after he praised Zuckerberg for Meta’s new AI model, Llama 3.1.

“PhonePe was born in Bengaluru and we are incredibly proud of our roots in this city, which is well known for its world-class technology talent and vibrant diversity. From Bengaluru, over the past decade we have expanded across the length and breadth of India and been able to deliver secure and efficient digital payments for over 55 Crore Indians.

Bengaluru's reputation as the ""Silicon valley of India"" is truly well-deserved. The city thrives on an incredible culture of innovation, and attracts the most brilliant young minds from Karnataka and the rest of India. As a company, we are deeply grateful for the supportive business environment that Karnataka’s governments and its local

Kannadiga

populace have offered us. Without such an inclusive ecosystem and progressive policies, Bengaluru would not have become a global technology superpower.

As a company we also thrive on celebrating diversity, we have always tried hard to deliver fair, unbiased and meritocracy-based employment opportunities for all Indians - including to all local Kannadigas. We believe such an approach gives every Indian a good job a chance to shine, and ultimately helps create more societal and economic value for Bengaluru, Karnataka and India.

I read some recent media articles, relating to a few personal comments that I made last week regarding the draft job reservation bill. I would first and foremost like to clarify that it was NEVER my intention to insult Karnataka and it’s people. If my comments hurt anyone’s sentiments in such a way, I am truly sorry and would like to offer you an unconditional apology. I have the highest regard for Kannada, and all other Indian languages. In fact, I truly believe that linguistic diversity and rich cultural heritage is a national asset that all Indians should be proud of; and all Indians should be respectful of and celebrate local and cultural norms.

Bengaluru’s Indian startups are competing against trillion dollar giants like Google, Apple, Amazon and Microsoft. To do so, these companies must be able to employ the very best talent available in India purely based on their technology skills and proficiency in fields such as Coding, Design, Product Management, Data Sciences, Machine Learning, AI and beyond. As a nation, that is the only way we can build world-class companies that can compete in the global village that we live in today.

I also want to help create lakhs of jobs for Bengaluru and Karnataka. And, I believe with more dialogue and discussion, we can find ways to create more sustainable employment avenues. Let’s all work together to do this meaningfully and while creating long-term impact.”

PhonePe CEO Sameer Nigam issued a personal note following backlash over his comments on Karnataka 's job reservation bill. The controversy erupted after Nigam criticised the bill on social media platform X, questioning whether his children deserved jobs in their home city given his company's pan-India job creation.""If my comments hurt anyone's sentiments, I am truly sorry and would like to offer you an unconditional apology,"" Nigam said in a statement.He emphasised his 22-year connection to Bengaluru and respect for linguistic diversity.The Karnataka Cabinet had recently approved a bill mandating 50% reservation for locals in management roles and 70% in non-management positions within private companies. The bill, which also proposed 100% quota for locals in certain government jobs, was put on hold after industry backlash.Nigam stressed the need for merit-based hiring to build globally competitive companies. He reaffirmed PhonePe's commitment to Karnataka, stating the company plans to create thousands of new jobs in the state.",PhonePe CEO Sameer Nigam issued a personal note following backlash over his comments on Karnataka's job reservation bill.
