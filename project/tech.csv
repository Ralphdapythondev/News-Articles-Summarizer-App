Apple iPod creator Tony Fadell on ChatGPT creator OpenAI CEO: I’m not just spouting sh** — I’m not Sam Altman,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-ipod-creator-tony-fadell-on-chatgpt-creator-openai-ceo-im-not-just-spouting-sh-im-not-sam-altman/articleshow/114791504.cms,"Not impressed with ChatGPT CEO Sam Altman

'AI risks need understanding'

Tony Fadell , known for his work on Apple iPod and Nest Labs , expressed skepticism about the current state of large language models (LLMs) and their potential for harm. Speaking at TechCrunch Disrupt 2024 in San Francisco, US, Fadell took aim at OpenAI CEO Sam Altman Talking about his understanding of the history of AI development before the large language model (LLM) craze and the issues with LLM hallucinations, he reportedly said, “I’ve been doing AI for 15 years, people, I’m not just spouting s—. I’m not Sam Altman, okay?”During the spirited interview, Fadell criticized the overhyped nature of LLMs and their propensity for hallucinations. He highlighted the importance of transparency and accountability in AI development, arguing that current models lack both. ""LLMs are trying to be this 'general' thing because we're trying to make science fiction happen,"" he said. ""They're a know-it-all... I hate know-it-alls.""Instead of relying on these general-purpose models, Fadell advocated for specialized AI agents that are trained on specific tasks and are more transparent about their limitations. He emphasized the need for greater regulation to ensure responsible AI development and deployment.The criticism of Altman came as Fadell shared his own experiences with AI, dating back to his work at Nest. He noted that even a decade ago, AI was a sensitive topic, and people were wary of its potential implications. However, the recent AI boom has led to a widespread adoption of these technologies without a full understanding of their limitations and risks.Fadell's comments serve as a stark reminder of the potential dangers of unchecked AI development. As AI becomes increasingly integrated into our daily lives, it is crucial to approach these technologies with caution and a critical eye.","Tony Fadell, known for his work on Apple iPod and Nest Labs, expressed skepticism about the current state of large language models (LLMs) and their potential for harm.

Xiaomi launches faster version of EV that Ford CEO said he is driving and does not want to give up,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/xiaomi-launches-faster-version-of-ev-that-ford-ceo-said-he-is-driving-and-does-not-want-to-give-up/articleshow/114791383.cms,"(Representative Image)

Ford CEO has been driving the Xiaomi EV for 6 months

Meet 'China's Tesla'

Smartphone giant Xiaomi seems to be keen to shed its 'affordable brand tag'. The company has taken a significant step into the luxury electric vehicle market with the launch of the SU7 Ultra . Priced at a hefty $114,000, this high-performance EV according to Xiaomi would rank as the fastest four-door car in production in a direct challenge to the likes of Tesla and Porsche.Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun pricing that put the new EV on a par with the Tesla Model S Plaid and reportedly signaled an intent to compete on performance rather than cost with more established car makers.Incidentally, Xiaomi SU7 Ultra is a variant of Xiaomi SU7 that Ford CEO Jim Farley recently expressed admiration for. Farley said that he has been driving the SUV for six months and is quite impressed with its performance and technology integration. In a recent podcast interview, the CEO said that he has been driving the electric vehicle made by Xiaomi and “doesn’t want to give it up.”“This Xiaomi car… is fantastic. They sell ten thousand, twenty thousand a month,” Farley said. “I don’t like talking about the competition much, but we flew [an SU7] from Shanghai to Chicago and I’ve been driving it for six months now, and I don’t want to give it up.” Ford CEO is said to have imported the car from China as geopolitical tensions have limited the direct entry of Chinese automakers into the US market.The SU7 Ultra boasts impressive specifications, including a top speed that surpasses thePorsche Taycan Turbo and acceleration that outperforms the Tesla Model S Plaid. Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun emphasized the company's ambition to build a ""dream car"" that pushes the boundaries of automotive performance.To achieve this, the SU7 Ultra incorporates premium features like carbon-fiber components and performance ceramic brakes. The vehicle has also set a record lap time at the legendary Nurburgring track, further solidifying its position as a performance powerhouse.Xiaomi's entry into the luxury EV segment aligns with the growing trend of Chinese automakers challenging established brands. By offering a compelling blend of performance, technology, and affordability, Xiaomi aims to capture a significant share of the market. The company has already seen substantial success with its mainstream EV offerings, delivering over 10,000 vehicles per month since June.","Ford CEO has been driving the Xiaomi EV for 6 months and “doesn’t want to give it up” The SU7 Ultra boasts impressive specifications, including a top speed that surpasses thePorsche Taycan Turbo and acceleration that outperforms the Tesla Model S Plaid.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114791379,imgsize-92530,width-400,resizemode-4/114791379.jpg"
There may be a 'China angle' in Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella's $5.5 million 'salary cut',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/there-may-be-a-china-angle-in-microsoft-ceo-satya-nadellas-5-5-million-salary-cut/articleshow/114790373.cms,"Satya Nadella requested for reduction in cash compensation

Breakdown of Satya Nadella’s Earnings

Stock Awards: $71,236,392 (approx. Rs 600 crore)

Non-Equity Incentive Plan: $5.2 million (approx. Rs 44 crore)

Base Salary: $2.5 million (more than Rs 21 crore)

Miscellaneous Compensation: $169,791 (approx. Rs 15 lakh)

What the filing said

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella saw a 63% increase in his salary for the financial year 2024. As revealed by the company in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing, Nadella’s total compensation for the financial year that ended in June 30, amounted to approximately $79.1 million (around Rs 665 crore). This increase was mainly driven by the stock awards. The filing revealed that his stock awards increased to $71 million from $39 million the previous year.As per the SEC filing, Nadella’s cash incentive for fiscal year 2024 was $5.2 million. He was originally intended to get $10.7 million. The software giant's boss received $2.5 million as base salary and $170,000 in other compensation.The filing revealed that Nadella requested a pay cut this year on account of multiple cybersecurity breaches, including the Microsoft outage in July this year that impacted Windows users across the world. The US Department of Homeland Security in April published a report after an independent review of China’s breach of US government officials’ email accounts. Microsoft disclosed the incident in July 2023. In January, the tech giant confirmed that Russian intelligence had accessed some of its top executives’ email accounts.“Mr. Nadella agreed that the Company's performance was extremely strong, but reflecting on his personal commitment to security and his role as the CEO, asked the Board to consider departing from the established performance metrics and reduce his cash incentive to reflect his personal accountability for the focus and speed required for the changes that today's cybersecurity threat landscape showed were necessary,” the filing read.It said “Since the board of directors appointed Mr Nadella as the third chief executive officer in its history in 2014, Microsoft has nearly tripled revenue to $245.1 billion (approximately Rs 2,060 crore), nearly quadrupled net income to $88.1 billion (approximately Rs 740 crore), and more than quadrupled diluted earnings per share to $11.80 (approximately Rs 99 crore). In addition to another year of consistently strong financial performance, Mr Nadella and his leadership team have positioned Microsoft to continue to drive performance for years to come,”.","Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella saw a 63% increase in his salary for the financial year 2024.

What YouTube has to say on claims of hiding view counts and upload dates on videos,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/what-youtube-has-to-say-on-claims-of-hiding-view-counts-and-upload-dates-on-videos/articleshow/114782829.cms,"How it all started?

What YouTube has to say

Days after it was reported that YouTube is experimenting with a new website layout that hides two key pieces of information: the upload date and the view count of videos the Google-owned company has responded, providing a clarification on what may be happening.A new layout was spotted in the wild by X user @vidIQ and was reported upon by an online publication Dexerto. It claimed that YouTube is experimenting with a new website layout that hides key information from users and the redesigned homepage removes both the upload date and view count from video previews, leaving only the thumbnail, title, and channel name visible.The report grabbed eyeballs with several content creators , including Marques Brownlee , also known as MKBHD, a popular tech YouTuber, saying, “Stop chasing Netflix and just be YouTube.” While some expressed that while removing view counts is acceptable, removing dates isn't ideal.The proposed changes to YouTube's homepage layout have sparked debate about their potential impact on content visibility. Some users worry that hiding view counts and upload dates could lead to viewers overlooking videos with lower engagement, while others argue that it could create a more level playing field for new creators by reducing the bias towards videos with high view counts.In response, YouTube clarified that it is due to extensions that the homepage experience is changed.@Dexerto Jumping in here to clarify that this may happen if viewers are watching YouTube with certain browser extensions enabled. If they disable extensions and still encounter this homepage experience, they can submit a report here & we'll investigate: https://goo.gle/4fiueJfThe Google-owned company has already removed various elements like the dislike button in 2021.","A new layout was spotted in the wild by X user @vidIQ and was reported upon by an online publication Dexerto.

India wealth surge amid China’s decline in billionaires



Zhang Yiming vs. Mukesh Ambani



Also Read |

ByteDance founder Zhang Yiming leads China’s wealthiest individuals with a fortune of $49.3 billion, according to the latest Hurun China Rich List . This marks a significant achievement for Zhang, who has now overtaken Zhong Shanshan, chairperson of Nongfu Spring, who had held the top spot for three consecutive years. However, even as China’s richest billionaire, Yiming remains well behind India’s wealthiest individual, Mukesh Ambani , chairman of Reliance Industries , whose net worth exceeds $102 billion.Zhang, 44, achieved his wealth largely due to the success of ByteDance and its immensely popular app TikTok, which boasts over a billion active monthly users worldwide. The company saw its profits surge around 30% last year, underscoring its strong market position.Despite this, the Hurun Research Institute reports that the total wealth of Chinese entrepreneurs this year stands at $3 trillion, reflecting a 10% decline from the previous year. “The Hurun China Rich List has shrunk for the third consecutive year due to a challenging economic climate and stock market performance,” noted Rupert Hoogewerf, chairman and chief researcher of Hurun.This year’s list illustrates a significant shift in the profiles of the richest individuals in China. Unlike previous years when real estate developers dominated the rankings, the current list is predominantly composed of entrepreneurs from technology, consumer electronics, and new energy sectors. Hoogewerf emphasised that the stories of the individuals on the Hurun China Rich List reflect the changing narrative of the Chinese economy.Moreover, the new generation of Chinese entrepreneurs is becoming increasingly international in scope. Hoogewerf pointed out how Zhang Yiming has successfully globalised ByteDance with TikTok, and how Colin Huang has crafted Pinduoduo’s ascent as a global e-commerce player through the platform Temu.As the economic landscape continues to evolve, Zhang Yiming’s emergence as the richest person in China marks a significant milestone in the ongoing narrative of wealth creation and transformation in the region.In stark contrast to China’s declining billionaire count, India is witnessing a surge in wealth creation. The Hurun India Rich List has shown a 29% increase in billionaires this year, totaling 334. While China still leads with 753 billionaires, its count has decreased by 25%. This year’s China Rich List added only 54 new billionaires, the lowest figure in two decades, whereas India's list hit a new high with triple-digit increases across all major sectors.Zhang Yiming, at 41, has a net worth reported at $49.3 billion by Hurun, although Bloomberg’s Billionaires Index estimates it to be closer to $43 billion. As the founder of ByteDance, the parent company of the popular platforms Douyin and TikTok, Yiming’s enterprise achieved $110 billion in revenue last year, solidifying its standing in the tech industry.On the other hand, Mukesh Ambani's net worth has reached $102 billion, buoyed by a 25% increase over the past year. Reliance Industries has seen its stock surge, thanks to strategic investments in energy and retail, projected earnings growth, and recent price hikes in its telecom division, Jio."," ByteDance founder Zhang Yiming leads China’s wealthiest individuals with a fortune of $49.3 billion, according to the latest Hurun China Rich List.

Reliance enters in partnership with Nvidia

The 2024 Nvidia AI Summit in Mumbai saw Bollywood superstar Akshay Kumar rubbing shoulders with Jensen Huang , CEO of AI giant Nvidia. While the summit focused on strengthening India's AI capabilities, their encounter ended with a surprising discussion – martial arts.Kumar, a known martial arts enthusiast, shared a photo on social media X, formerly known as Twitter, where he and Huang pose playfully in a fighting stance. The caption reads: ""Imagine meeting the world’s biggest authority on Artificial Intelligence and ending up chatting about martial arts!! What an amazing man you are Mr. #JensenHuang. Now I know why @nvidia is the absolute giant that it is. 😊👍🏻""Nvidia's leather-jacket-clad CEO Huang got a rock star welcome at the company's AI summit in India. As a Bloomberg report said, ""The reception Huang received in India's commercial capital Mumbai was reminiscent of the ""Jensanity"" seen in other parts of the world, especially Taiwan, as his popularity climbs with Nvidia's soaring earnings and multi-trillion dollar market valuation.""Huang praised India's rapid digitalisation and its potential in the AI sector. ""Very few countries have this amazing natural resource called IT and computer science expertise,"" he said.The event, where the U.S. company unveiled plans to supply Reliance Industries and other Indian firms with its AI chips, had to be reportedly delayed for more than half an hour due to the crowd that one Nvidia employee said was ""easily a few thousand"".Nvidia CEO Huang and Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani announced a strategic partnership to build state-of-the-art AI infrastructure in India at the summit. The collaboration aims to accelerate India's transformation into a global AI powerhouse by leveraging the nation's vast talent pool and burgeoning digital infrastructure. ""We are among the only countries where the average age of 1.4 billion people is below 35,"" he noted. Ambani emphasised that India's aspirations, combined with the visionary leadership of the Indian Prime Minister, have set the stage for a digital revolution.

Apple makes a comeback to China's top 5 smartphone vendors

iPhone-maker Apple is expected to announce its biggest quarterly revenue since 2022 in its upcoming Thursday report. According to Reuters, consumer interest in iPhones has shown stronger resilience late in the product cycle compared to previous years, particularly in the Chinese market.While the results will give investors the first hints of demand for the new iPhone 16 series, the key focus will be on executive commentary for its fiscal first quarter. There are concerns that the gradual rollout of Apple Intelligence could weaken an expected AI-led ""super-cycle"" for Apple's biggest seller.The report quotes Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi who said “The strength of the iPhone 16 cycle is the most important question heading into both the December quarter and FY25. Investors should expect Apple to be upbeat about iPhone 16 and Apple Intelligence, but it may or may not necessarily reflect the ultimate success of the cycle.”The Cupertino-based company released a limited rollout of Apple Intelligence features this Monday, weeks after the iPhone 16 went on sale. “The limited rollout has raised worries that customers may push device purchases from the all-important holiday season to next year, delaying a potential boost to sales from AI,” the report says.Apple has bounced back to become China's second-largest smartphone vendor in the third quarter of 2024, following strong iPhone 16 sales. According to data released by IDC, the iPhone maker captured 15.6% of the Chinese smartphone market, trailing only Vivo's 18.6% market share. However, Apple's position remains precarious, with its market share declining from 16.1% in the same period last year and shipments dropping 0.3% year-over-year.Huawei's dramatic comeback poses a significant challenge to Apple's position, with the Chinese tech giant securing 15.3% market share and recording a 42% surge in shipments. This marks Huawei's fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, driven by the success of its domestically produced advanced processors and strong patriotic consumer sentiment.The competitive landscape has prompted Apple to offer additional promotions for the iPhone 16 in China, including discounts on popular online platforms like Pinduoduo and Taobao ahead of the Singles' Day shopping festival.","Apple is expected to announce its biggest quarterly revenue since 2022 in its upcoming Thursday report. Consumer interest in iPhones has shown stronger resilience late in the product cycle compared to previous years. There are concerns that the gradual rollout of Apple Intelligence could weaken an expected AI-led ""super-cycle"" for Apple's biggest seller.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114775593,imgsize-143728,width-400,resizemode-4/114775593.jpg"
How Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger could not get 56-year old chipmaker's comeback plan right,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-intel-ceo-pat-gelsinger-could-not-get-56-year-old-chipmakers-comeback-plan-right/articleshow/114774485.cms,"TSMC partnership sours, AI opportunity missed

Manufacturing woes plague turnaround plans

CEO Gelsinger’s “painful news” to employees as chipmaker

Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger is “confident” about company’s “turnaround” plan

Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger 's ambitious three-year effort to restore the 56-year-old American chipmaker to its former glory has faltered amid strategic blunders, manufacturing setbacks, and deepening financial losses, forcing the company to lay off 15,000 employees and fundamentally restructure its operations.Under Gelsinger's watch, Intel's revenue has plummeted to $54 billion in 2023, nearly one-third below when he took charge in 2021. The company now faces its first annual net loss since 1986, with analysts expecting a $3.68 billion deficit this year, Reuters has learned. The stock has crashed 66% from its peak during Gelsinger's early months as CEO.""This is painful news for me to share,"" Gelsinger wrote in a memo to employees. ""Our revenues have not grown as expected — and we've yet to fully benefit from powerful trends, like AI.""One of Gelsinger's earliest missteps came just months into his tenure when he publicly questioned Taiwan's stability, offending crucial manufacturing partner TSMC. ""Taiwan is not a stable place,"" he declared at a tech conference in December 2021, according to sources familiar with the matter.The diplomatic blunder cost Intel dearly. TSMC withdrew a valuable 40% discount on its $23,000 3-nanometer wafers, significantly impacting Intel's profit margins on chips manufactured by the Taiwanese giant, Reuters reported.In the booming artificial intelligence sector, Gelsinger's optimistic public projections clashed with internal realities. While Intel teams estimated maximum AI chip sales of $500 million, Gelsinger pushed for public announcements of a $1 billion sales pipeline to match market expectations, sources told Reuters. The company later quietly revised its 2024 AI revenue target back to $500 million.The AI miscalculation extended to client relationships. Sources say Gelsinger oversaw a deal to build custom chips for Alphabet's Waymo self-driving taxis, personally discussing the agreement with Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai . However, Intel later cancelled the project amid worsening financial conditions, paying a fee to Alphabet after it threatened legal action.Intel's ambitious 18A chip manufacturing process, central to Gelsinger's $60 billion foundry expansion strategy, has encountered significant obstacles. Early tests by potential customer Broadcom revealed disappointing results, with merely 20% of chips passing quality tests – far below industry standards.In response to these challenges, Intel announced a major restructuring of its foundry business as an independent subsidiary. The restructuring provides Intel Foundry with ""clearer separation and independence"" from the parent company, including its own operating board and separate financial reporting.Gelsinger indicated this structure would allow ""flexibility to evaluate independent sources of funding"" for the struggling foundry business, which posted operating losses of $7 billion in 2023 and another $2.8 billion in the latest quarter.While Intel secured a significant win with a multiyear, multibillion-dollar agreement with Amazon Web Services to produce an ""artificial intelligence fabric chip"" using the 18A process, other major potential clients including Apple and Qualcomm have declined to use the technology, sources familiar with their decisions told Reuters.The manufacturing challenges have forced Intel to pause construction of new chip plants in Germany and Poland for approximately two years, citing ""anticipated market demand.""""All eyes will remain on us,"" Gelsinger acknowledged, emphasising the importance of the restructuring and new partnerships in Intel's turnaround efforts. However, a recent supplier document indicates further delays in the 18A technology's rollout, with customers having little prospect of high-volume production until 2026.""This is painful news for me to share,"" Gelsinger wrote to employees. ""We must align our cost structure with our new operating model and fundamentally change the way we operate. We will reduce layers, eliminate overlapping areas of responsibility, stop non-essential work.""The cost-cutting measures have extended globally, reaching as far as Intel's Israeli operations, where even basic employee benefits are being eliminated. In a telling sign of the depth of cuts, Israeli employees recently arrived at work to find empty kitchen stations and a notice announcing the end of complimentary beverage services. Vehicle benefits for senior employees have also been cut, effectively reducing some salaries by 10%.In a dramatic reversal of strategy, Intel is now exploring the sale of a minority stake in Altera, its programmable chip subsidiary, seeking a deal that values the unit at around $17 billion. This represents a significant shift for Intel, which acquired Altera for $16.7 billion in 2015 and had, as recently as last month, described it as core to the company's future. Intel is also shutting down Granulate, a startup it acquired for $650 million less than three years ago, as part of its transformation process.The stark reality of Intel's situation is evident in its staffing numbers. ""Our annual revenue in 2020 was about $24 billion higher than it was last year, yet our current workforce is actually 10% larger now than it was then,"" Gelsinger acknowledged in his memo to staff. ""There are a lot of reasons for this, but it's not a sustainable path forward.""The company's restructuring efforts extend beyond personnel cuts. Intel announced plans to reduce its global real estate footprint by about two-thirds and pause construction of new chip plants in Germany and Poland for approximately two years. However, the company will continue with its US manufacturing projects in Arizona, Oregon, New Mexico, and Ohio, supported by $3 billion in funding from the CHIPS Act.Despite the setbacks, Gelsinger maintains his characteristic optimism about Intel's turnaround prospects. ""I'm very confident that we're going to pull it off,"" he told Reuters in August. ""Three years in, yeah. This one's going to happen, baby.""However, with Intel now the worst-performing tech stock in the S&P 500 this year and facing intense competition in both AI and traditional chip markets, the company's path to recovery remains uncertain.","Intel's revenue has plummeted to $54 billion in 2023, nearly one-third below when he took charge in 2021.

As online grocery platforms like Zomato's Blinkit gain traction by offering rapid delivery services for festive purchases, a troubling incident has emerged from Delhi. Mohit Jain, a resident of the city, claims he was scammed while ordering gold and silver coins for Dhanteras , a significant occasion for buying precious metals. Despite the promise of a swift 10-minute delivery, Jain alleges that he received a 0.5-gram gold coin instead of the one-gram coin he ordered.This incident has not only raised questions about the reliability of such services but also sparked outrage among customers regarding Blinkit's customer support and the accuracy of their deliveries, prompting a broader conversation about consumer protection in the burgeoning quick-commerce sector.Sharing his ordeal on social media platform X, Mohit stated, “I got scammed by Blinkit. I ordered a one-gram gold coin along with a one-gram silver coin. The payment was made in advance. Since I wasn’t home to receive the delivery, I provided my younger brother with the OTP to collect it.”Upon returning home about 20 minutes later, Mohit was shocked to discover the wrong item had been delivered. He explained, “When I checked, I found that I received a 0.5-gram Malabar gold coin (rose design) instead of the one-gram Mata Lakshmi gold coin I ordered.”Frustrated by the situation, Mohit noted that by the time he got home, the return window had closed, preventing him from contacting customer support. “I called the delivery person and was nearly in tears while explaining the situation,” he shared.Despite the delivery partner having photographic evidence of the correct one-gram coin that was supposed to be delivered, Mohit reported that the delivery person stated he could do nothing about the error.Mohit also emphasised that CCTV footage corroborated his claim, showing that the incorrect item had been delivered. Accompanying his tweet, he posted a picture of the 0.5-gram gold coin he received and screenshots of his order details.According to his order confirmation, Mohit had purchased a 24 kt, one-gram Goddess Lakshmi gold coin but instead received a 0.5-gram coin with a rose design. He had also ordered a 10-gram Laxmi Ganesh silver coin, both listed under Malabar Gold & Diamonds. In his communication with Blinkit's customer support, Mohit received a message stating, “We are sorry. The complaint window for the selected item(s) is closed.” An automated response suggested that he provide feedback on the issue to help improve their services.The incident has sparked a wave of reactions on social media, with users expressing their frustration with Blinkit's service. One user wrote, ""Blinkit is a scam these days. Their customer care is a complete joke. Avoid ordering expensive items from them."" Another user questioned, “What is this behaviour?” while a third urged, “Blinkit, please look into this.” A fourth user vented, ""Have some shame, corporate greed!""","Mohit Jain claims he was scammed while ordering gold and silver coins for Dhanteras.

In a shocking case of online fraud a 59-year old retired principal from a prestigious engineering college in Hyderabad lost a huge sum of Rs 8.1 crore.Resident of Hyderabad, Chennupati Vijayakumar became a victim of an elaborate investment scheme scam. Vijayakumar began transferring funds through a fraudulent investment app called RK Global in July 2024. The app initially allowed him to withdraw a small sum, creating a sense of legitimacy. However, subsequent attempts to withdraw larger amounts were met with failure, despite the app showing the funds as available. When Vijayakumar inquired about this discrepancy, the app's supposed customer care service advised him to pay a further 2% of his total investment, amounting to a staggering Rs 37.5 crore.Realising he had been duped, Vijayakumar filed a complaint with the Telangana State Cyber Security Bureau on October 21.According to the police complaint filed by Vijayakumar, he first received a call from a woman in July 2024. The woman claimed to work for a company called ' SIG Group ' and invited him to join a WhatsApp group named 'SIG Trading'.Vijaykumar joined the WhatsApp group and participated in online trading sessions led by 'SIG Group Teacher' Eric Robertson and his assistant, Lyons. The group provided regular updates on market trends, block trades, and IPO opportunities, gradually persuading Vijayakumar to invest.On July 15, Vijayakumar was added to another WhatsApp group, 'E26-RK Global Customer Care.' Here, he received trading advice and IPO recommendations through the 'RK Global' app, provided by the scammers. The fraudsters claimed to have connections with 'institutional investors' and promised guaranteed IPO allotments, luring Vijayakumar with the prospect of substantial profits.After this, Vijaykumar started transferring funds through the RK Global totalling over Rs 8.1 crore till October 3. Initially, Vijayakumar was able to withdraw a small amount of Rs 2,000. However, subsequent withdrawal attempts, though displayed as successful on the app, did not reflect in his bank account. When he raised concerns with RK Global's customer care, he was instructed to pay 2% of his total balance, amounting to Rs 37.5 crore, to resolve the issue. Despite facing financial difficulties, Vijayakumar was pressured to pay Rs 75 lakh in multiple transactions. However, the withdrawal issues persisted.After facing repeated demands for more payments, Vijayakumar became suspicious. An online search confirmed his doubts, leading him to report the incident to the cybercrime helpline on October 18.","Chennupati Vijayakumar, a 59-year-old retired principal from a prestigious engineering college in Hyderabad lost a huge sum of Rs 8.1 crore.

The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India ( TRAI ) has reportedly granted a one-month extension to December 1st for telecommunications operators to implement a new traceability mandate for commercial messages, including one-time passwords ( OTPs ).

As per the revised deadline, messages not conforming to the traceability mandate will be blocked from December 1, as against the earlier deadline of November 1.Telecom operators -- Airtel , Vodafone-Idea and Reliance Jio -- had expressed concerns about the potential disruptions of blocking messages that don't adhere to the traceability rules, as many telemarketers and businesses, including banks, may not be fully prepared.To mitigate these concerns, TRAI has allowed a gradual implementation process. From now until November 30th, operators will issue daily warnings to entities that fail to comply with chain declaration requirements. Starting December 1st, messages from non-compliant entities will be blocked.This is the second extension granted by TRAI to the industry. Earlier, the deadline for whitelisting messages with URLs and OTT links was extended to October 1st.TRAI's efforts to curb spam and enhance security in the telecom sector include blacklisting entities, disconnecting mobile numbers, and migrating telemarketing calls to a blockchain-based platform for stricter monitoring.","Airtel, Vodafone-Idea and Reliance Jio to now send daily warnings to non- compliant entities.

Why the big China ban

What are the exceptions to the rule

The Biden administration announced on Monday that it is finalizing rules to restrict U.S. investments in artificial intelligence and other technology sectors in China that could pose a threat to U.S. national security . According to a report by news agency Reuters, these rules, proposed by the U.S. Treasury in June, stem from an executive order signed by President Joe Biden in August 2023.The House select committee on China has reportedly criticized major American index providers for channeling billions of dollars from U.S. investors into stocks of Chinese companies that the U.S. believes are aiding the development of China’s military.They target three key sectors: Semiconductors and microelectronics; quantum information technologies; and certain AI systems. The new regulations will take effect on January 2 and will be managed by the Treasury's newly established Office of Global Transactions.The Treasury emphasized that this ""narrow set of technologies"" is crucial for the next generation of military, cybersecurity, surveillance, and intelligence applications. Paul Rosen, a senior Treasury official, reportedly noted that the rule covers technologies such as ""cutting-edge code-breaking computer systems or next-generation fighter jets."" He added that U.S. investments, including intangible benefits like managerial assistance and access to investment and talent networks, must not aid countries of concern in developing their military, intelligence, and cyber capabilities.This rule is part of a broader effort to prevent U.S. expertise from assisting China in developing advanced technology and dominating global markets. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo highlighted earlier this year that these rules are essential to prevent China from advancing its military-related technologies.Beginning January 2, investors will be banned from funneling capital and “intangible benefits,” like managerial assistance and access to investment and talent networks, to help China and other “countries of concern” develop military, intelligence, and cybersecurity capabilities.The new regulations include an exception for U.S. investments in publicly traded securities.
