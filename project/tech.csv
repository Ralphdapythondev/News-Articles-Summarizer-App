What the Flipkart sellers say

CCI investigation found Flipkart, Amazon giving undue preference

Flipkart, the Walmart-owned e-commerce platform, is at the center of a legal dispute as three of its online sellers have filed a lawsuit against the Competition Commission of India (CCI). The sellers are challenging an investigation conducted by the antitrust watchdog, which concluded that they, along with Flipkart and its rival Amazon , had violated competition laws in India, reports Reuters.Flipkart sellers seek to halt the investigation by CCI through legal action in the Karnataka High Court . Three vendors on the e-commerce platform have reportedly filed submissions requesting the court to ""set aside"" the investigation report and suspend the CCI's ongoing process, in an apparent attempt to suppress the critical proceedings.The lawsuit has been filed by three of Flipkart sellers - CIGFIL Retail , Wishery Online, Xonique Ventures . In their lawsuits, they argue that during the investigation they were called to submit data to help officials, but were later named as accused, which is against due process.""The alleged investigation ... is arbitrary, opaque, unfair,"" the sellers argued in three separate court filings, which will come up for hearing likely next week.The filings come after antitrust investigations concluded in August found that Amazon, Flipkart along with some of the sellers and smartphone brands give undue preference to select online sellers and prioritizing certain listings. The lawsuits filed by sellers could potentially delay the investigation process which first started in 2020, and was triggered after brick-and-mortar retailers of the Confederation of All India Traders complained to the watchdog.Last week, a former Amazon seller also sued the CCI and obtained an interim injunction to block the investigation from proceeding.","Flipkart sellers seek to halt the investigation by CCI through legal action in the Karnataka High Court.

How WhatsApp ‘Chitta’ ran operations

Negi worked with over 40 associates

Police have caught an Apple trader who was running a drug racket via WhatsApp in Shimla, a report has said. The police arrested a person named Shahi Mahatma (Shashi Negi) for running a sophisticated WhatsApp ‘ Chitta ’ (adulterated heroin) cartel in the hills. The police used a “socially integrated intelligence network system” – which involved local residents as informers – to bust the drug racket.According to a report by news agency PTI, police made the arrests on September 20.They said that the drugs were supplied to Jubbal-Kotkhai and Theog areas of Upper Shimla under the garb of apple business, and the kingpin had links with Nigerian drug gangs in New Delhi and other gangs in Haryana as well as with people in Kashmir as well.Negi ran a sophisticated drug operation in the Shimla region for five-six years. He was not caught before because the points of contact were so varied they could not be connected to reach him.He used WhatsApp to take orders and coordinate deliveries of adulterated heroin (""chitta""), but cleverly kept the different parts of his network separate to avoid detection.Negi acted as the central hub, connecting buyers and sellers, but he never interacted with them directly. He employed different groups of people to handle orders, deliveries, and payments, ensuring they remained isolated from each other.Even during the final delivery, the person and buyer wouldn't meet. The drugs would be left in a secluded spot, and the buyer would be directed to their location through a video. Payments reached the final destination passing through multiple bank accounts to obscure the money trail, the report added.His arrest exposed a network of over 40 associates involved in the drug trade. The police have seized 465 grams of 'Chitta' from Kharapathar and arrested 25 associates of this gang.“Links of the accused Mudasir Ahmed Mochi, a resident of Bhatpura village in Kupwara district in Jammu and Kashmir (who was arrested on September 19) were established with Shahi Mahatma alias Shashi Negi and the kingpin was arrested,” SP Shimla Sanjeev Kumar Gandhi was quoted as saying.",Shahi Mahatma (Shashi Negi) ran a sophisticated WhatsApp ‘ Chitta ’ (adulterated heroin) cartel in the hills.

Picture abhi baaki hai (The story isn't over yet)

Today, I celebrate 2 years of being in IndiGo (

InterGlobe Aviation

Ltd) and India. On our 18th IndiGo birthday last month, we celebrated many wonderful milestones and unveiled our ambitious plans for coming years. Our story has just started. I am grateful and proud to be a part of this incredible IndiGo journey with my colleagues - giving wings to the nation with over 2,000 daily flights, 430+ domestic and 100+ international routes, and growing every day.

When I had joined, I had shared the quote, ""Wherever you go, becomes a part of you somehow”. Being a part of IndiGo and now living now in India for two years....IndiGo and this beautiful country India have indeed become a part of me. Bharat ab ghar jaisa lagta hai.

India's essence is captured in its beautiful diversity. Of our 88 domestic cities, I had the pleasure of visiting our great teams in 30. From Thiruvananthapuram in the south to Leh in the north. My most recent visit was to Leh, where walking with my son at 18,000 feet at the Khardung La Pass was very special considering my roots are from a country where the highest ""hill"" is some 300 metres only and around 25% of the land is below sea level 😊

Here are some pictures from my travels in the last two years. Can you guess the cities?

Hi all,

I have something to share with you. After much reflection, I have made the difficult decision to leave OpenAl. My six-and-a-half years with the OpenAl team have been an extraordinary privilege. While I'll express my gratitude to many individuals in the coming days, I want to start by thanking Sam and Greg for their trust in me to lead the technical organization and for their support throughout the years. There's never an ideal time to step away from a place one cherishes, yet this moment feels right. Our recent releases of speech-to-speech and OpenAl 01 mark the beginning of a new era in interaction and intelligence - achievements made possible by your ingenuity and craftsmanship. We didn't merely build smarter models, we fundamentally changed how Al systems learn and reason through complex problems. We brought safety research from the theoretical realm into practical applications, creating models that are more robust, aligned, and steerable than ever before. Our work has made cutting-edge Al research intuitive and accessible, developing technology that adapts and evolves based on everyone's input. This success is a testament to our outstanding teamwork, and it is because of your brilliance, your dedication, and your commitment that OpenAl stands at the pinnacle of AI innovation. I'm stepping away because I want to create the time and space to do my own exploration. For now, my primary focus is doing everything in my power to ensure a smooth transition, maintaining the momentum we've built.

I will forever be grateful for the opportunity to build and work alongside this remarkable team. Together, we've pushed the boundaries of scientific understanding in our quest to improve human well-being. While I may no longer be in the trenches with you, I will still be rooting for you all. With deep gratitude for the friendships forged, the triumphs achieved, and most importantly, the challenges overcome together.

Mira



What OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said

Hi All

Mira has been instrumental to OpenAI’s progress and growth the last 6.5 years; she has been a hugely significant factor in our development from an unknown research lab to an important company.

When Mira informed me this morning that she was leaving, I was saddened but of course support her decision. For the past year, she has been building out a strong bench of leaders that will continue our progress.

I also want to share that Bob and Barret have decided to depart OpenAI. Mira, Bob, and Barret made these decisions independently of each other and amicably, but the timing of Mira’s decision was such that it made sense to now do this all at once, so that we can work together for a smooth handover to the next generation of leadership.

I am extremely grateful to all of them for their contributions.

Being a leader at OpenAI is all-consuming. On one hand it’s a privilege to build AGI and be the fastest-growing company that gets to put our advanced research in the hands of hundreds of millions of people. On the other hand it’s relentless to lead a team through it—and they have gone above and beyond the call of duty for the company.

Mark is going to be our new SVP of Research and will now lead the research org in partnership with Jakub as Chief Scientist. This has been our long-term succession plan for Bob someday; although it’s happening sooner than we thought, I couldn’t be more excited that Mark is stepping into the role. Mark obviously has deep technical expertise, but he has also learned how to be a leader and manager in a very impressive way over the past few years.

Josh Achiam is going to take on a new role as Head of Mission Alignment, working across the company to ensure that we get all pieces (and culture) right to be in a place to succeed at the mission.

Kevin and Srinivas will continue to lead the Applied team.

Matt Knight will be our Chief Information Security Officer having already served in this capacity for a long time. This has been our plan for quite some time.

Mark, Jakub, Kevin, Srinivas, Matt, and Josh will report to me. I have over the past year or so spent most of my time on the non-technical parts of our organization; I am now looking forward to spending most of my time on the technical and product parts of the company.

...

Leadership changes are a natural part of companies, especially companies that grow so quickly and are so demanding. I obviously won’t pretend it’s natural for this one to be so abrupt, but we are not a normal company, and I think the reasons Mira explained to me (there is never a good time, anything not abrupt would have leaked, and she wanted to do this while OpenAI was in an upswing) make sense. We can both talk about this more tomorrow during all-hands.

Thank you for all of your hard work and dedication.

Sam

Common types of chatbot and voice assistant-based frauds:

Phishing scams : Scammers use chatbots to send convincing phishing emails or messages, attempting to trick victims into revealing personal information or clicking on malicious links.



: Scammers use chatbots to send convincing phishing emails or messages, attempting to trick victims into revealing personal information or clicking on malicious links.

: Scammers pose as tech support representatives to trick victims into revealing sensitive information or paying for unnecessary services. Voice-based scams: Scammers use voice assistants to make automated calls, often impersonating government officials or other authority figures, to pressure victims into providing personal information or financial details.



How to protect yourself:

Be cautious of unsolicited calls and messages: If you receive a call or message from an unknown number or a suspicious sender, be cautious and do not provide any personal information.



Verify the sender's identity: If you receive a message or call from someone claiming to be from a trusted organisation, verify their identity by contacting the organisation directly using a phone number or email address you know is legitimate.



Do not share personal information: Never share your personal information, such as your Social Security number, credit card details, or passwords, with anyone over the phone, email, or chat unless you are absolutely sure of the person's identity and the legitimacy of the request.



Be wary of urgent requests: Scammers often use a sense of urgency to pressure victims into making quick decisions. If you receive a request for immediate action, take your time and verify the information before proceeding.



Keep your software updated: Ensure that your devices and software are always up-to-date with the latest security patches to protect against vulnerabilities that could be exploited by scammers.



Use strong, unique passwords: Create strong, unique passwords for all of your online accounts and avoid using the same password for multiple accounts.

The study reveals that organisations in India's education sector experience an average of 8,195 attacks per week, compared to the global average of 3,355.This surge is attributed to the rapid shift to remote learning during the COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing digitization of education.""Cybercriminals are increasingly targeting critical sectors in India, particularly those handling vast amounts of personally identifiable information,"" said Sundar Balasubramanian, Managing Director for India and SAARC at Check Point Software Technologies. The healthcare sector follows closely behind education, with 7,982 weekly attacks per organisation. Government/Military and Consulting sectors also face significant threats, experiencing 4,590 and 4,177 weekly attacks per organisation, respectively.The report highlights several key findings across all sectors in India. Organisations face an average of 3,244 cyberattacks per week, nearly double the global average of 1,657. FakeUpdates, Qbot, and Formbook are identified as the most prevalent malware in the country. The study also found that 54% of attacks are delivered via email, with 58% of email-borne attacks using .exe files. Additionally, information disclosure vulnerabilities affect 70% of Indian organizations, exposing critical data to potential threats.The alarming increase in cyber attacks is largely attributed to the expanding digital footprint of educational institutions. As schools and universities collect and store vast amounts of sensitive student data, including personal, academic, and financial information, they become prime targets for cybercriminals. The widespread adoption of online learning platforms has further increased their vulnerability to data breaches .In light of these findings, the report emphasises the urgent need for organisations to strengthen their cybersecurity frameworks. This is particularly crucial given the rising threat posed by generative AI technologies, which could potentially make social engineering and phishing attacks even more sophisticated. Experts recommend implementing proactive measures, including robust defences and continuous monitoring, as essential steps to protect sensitive data and maintain operational integrity in the face of escalating cyber threats.","Indian educational institutions are facing an unprecedented wave of cyber attacks, with weekly incidents more than doubling the global average.

This week, Prime Minister Narendra Modi 's meeting with top tech CEOs in New York set the stage for strengthened US-India collaborations in technology and innovation. Meanwhile, the tech industry saw major shifts in workplace policies, with Dell announcing a return to full-time office work for its global sales team, sparking employee concerns. Cybersecurity issues came to the forefront as popular YouTuber Ranveer Allahbadia 's channels were hacked and subsequently restored, while Telegram made a surprising policy change regarding user data disclosure, and more in this week’s top tech news of the week.Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with top tech CEOs in New York during his 3-day US visit, discussing technology, innovation, and opportunities in India. The roundtable included industry leaders such as Adobe 's Shantanu Narayen, Google 's Sundar Pichai, IBM's Arvind Krishna, AMD 's Lisa Su, and Moderna 's Noubar Afeyan. He highlighted India's progress in technology and noted the optimism towards India.The meeting follows recent US-India collaborations in semiconductor supply chains and emerging technologies, including initiatives with GlobalFoundries and IBM.Dell's global sales team will be required to return to the office full-time starting September 30, 2024, ending the era of hybrid work. This decision, announced via email, has sparked significant backlash from employees concerned about commuting costs and potential layoffs. The company framed the shift as a ""return to winning and taking share"" in response to the rapidly evolving industry and technology landscape.However, employees view it sceptically, with some suggesting it's a tactic to encourage resignations and meet headcount reduction targets. The move follows a similar announcement by Amazon, which led to 73% of its workers considering job hunting according to a survey.Dell's email, signed by sales division presidents Bill Scannell and John Byrne, emphasises that remote work should be the exception rather than routine, but the decision has been met with criticism and concerns about hidden costs and potential pay cuts.Influencer and podcaster Ranveer Allahbadia, known as BeerBiceps, has had his YouTube channels restored after they were hacked and renamed on September 25. The cyberattack had resulted in the deletion of all videos and the renaming of his channels to focus on Elon Musk and Donald Trump.In a video update, Allahbadia thanked YouTube's team for restoring his channels and expressed gratitude to his supporters. He used the incident to raise awareness about cybersecurity, urging followers to educate themselves on the topic. Allahbadia denied speculation that the hack was a publicity stunt, stating, ""My work is my dharma. This is my faith.""Telegram has announced a significant policy change regarding user data disclosure.

Some LinkedIn users were ‘unhappy’ with the AI prompts



LinkedIn has reportedly removed its AI-powered prompts. These prompts were part of a suite of AI-powered enhancements that the Microsoft-owned professional networking platform announced in November of last year. It included questions that had been appearing under almost every post for LinkedIn Premium users for the last several months. While announcing the company promised that these tools will use gen AI to “meticulously analyse the content within your feed and across job postings, bringing to light pivotal opportunities.”In an emailed statement to Fast Company, LinkedIn spokesperson Suzi Owens said:to help our members grow in their careers, gathering feedback to improve and invest where it matters most.We’ve removed the insights on feed posts, as we continue to test and learn, but members can still use our AI-powered tools on the jobs home page to get personalised insights, like how to build a network, position yourself for a job, or learn about a company.”While prompt questions may be disappearing from general posts, LinkedIn may not be abandoning AI entirely. These prompts can be a key component of the job search experience, and the platform promises to further integrate AI features in the coming days, potentially enhancing user interactions in new and innovative ways.The company also LinkedIn recently modified its user agreement which will automatically enroll users into a program where their data can be used to train the platform's AI algorithms.According to the report, some users complained that there was no apparent way to disable the prompts. LinkedIn had promised that the feature would “take on the hard work of parsing through long articles, videos and posts.” However, clicking the prompts often produced simple AI-generated summaries of the original content.These LinkedIn Premium subscribers reportedly felt they were paying extra for a feature that was more of an annoyance than a benefit as it took up valuable space in their feeds without providing much value in return.",LinkedIn has reportedly removed its AI-powered prompts from general posts.

“Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao, the founder and former CEO of Binance, has been released from a U.S. federal prison on September 27, after serving a four-month sentence for violating

anti-money laundering

(AML) regulations. According to the U.S. Federal Bureau of Prisons, CZ had pled guilty to charges of failing to implement proper AML controls at Binance, the world’s largest

crypto exchange

by daily trading volume. He also stepped down as CEO.

Initially, the U.S.

Department of Justice

(DOJ) sought a 36-month sentence, but the court reduced it to four months after determining that CZ wasn’t directly aware of illegal activities at Binance. He also agreed to pay a $50 million fine, while Binance itself was hit with $4.3 billion in penalties for AML violations.

CZ spent two months in a minimum-security prison in California before being moved to a halfway house in Long Beach, where he was allowed supervised daytime outings. While CZ no longer runs Binance, the company continues to thrive under new leadership, surpassing 230 million users worldwide.

With an estimated net worth of $60 billion, CZ is the richest person to serve time in a U.S. prison. His personal wealth remains largely unaffected, and he still holds a 90% stake in Binance. The crypto community is now eager to see what CZ’s next move will be after his release. Binance, meanwhile, continues to dominate the global cryptocurrency landscape.”

What US alleged against Binance and Zhao



Binance founder Changpeng Zhao has been released from US jail . Zhao was released after serving a four-month sentence at a low-security correctional facility in California. Earlier this year, the Binance founder was sentenced after a US investigation discovered that the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange had failed to stop widespread criminal activity. Zhao pleaded guilty to charges brought by the US Department of Justice and paid a criminal fine of $50 million as well as a $50 million penalty to the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission along with relinquishing his executive role at Binance.The company also faced an even steeper penalty, settling with the US government for a staggering $4.3 billion, marking one of the largest corporate fines in the country’s history.In its Binance Square blog post, the company wrote:US prosecutors accused Binance of promoting a business model that attracted criminals and facilitated illegal activities. They alleged that Binance failed to report over 100,000 suspicious transactions linked to designated terrorist organisations and that the exchange even supported the sale of child sexual abuse material. Additionally, they alleged that Binance profited from ransomware attacks by receiving a significant portion of the proceeds.However, he is still the 25th richest person in the world with a net worth of $61 billion and retains nearly 90% stake in Binance, reports Forbes.","Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao, the founder and former CEO of Binance, has been released from a U.S. federal prison on September 27.

Hi Team,

This sales force has a culture of winning and a reputation of outpacing the competition. We are the best in the business! That doesn't come without dedicated focus, perseverance and grit. To uphold this legacy, we must continuously work at it. To grow faster than the market and take share, we must always be sharpening our edge.

The Sales floor is a unique environment that combines high energy with a culture of collaboration and continuous improvement. To harness this energy and grow skills, we believe our sales teams need to be together in the office. Additionally, our data shows that sales teams are more productive when onsite.

With that in mind, starting Monday, Sept. 30, the expectation is that ALL Global Sales team members who can work from a Dell office be onsite five days a week, regardless of role. Field sellers are expected to spend five days a week with customers and partners or in a

Dell Technologies

office. Field sellers who can't go into a Dell office should prioritize time spent in person with customers and partners. Remote sales team members who can't go into a Dell office should continue to work remotely. More communications pertaining to remote workers will be sent in the coming weeks.

Yes, this is a shift from current expectations. The industry and technology are moving fast, the opportunity is enormous and we need to ensure we are best positioned to seize it. We know situations will arise when you need to work remotely. This is expected, but working remotely should be the exception rather than routine. We also know many of you have organized your lives around three days in the office and you may need some time to make new arrangements.

Global Facilities will continue to assess neighborhood capacity and will address any future needs.

When we're not traveling to meet with customers and partners, we are in the office. When you step onto the Sales floor with all team members onsite, the energy is amazing - it's dynamic and fast- paced. Sales managers are actively engaged on the floor, not from a distance, providing real-time feedback, guidance and support.

Our strength lies in a culture of collaborating, winning and celebrating together. As we enter a new Al world, in-person human interaction will be more important than ever.

Let's go win, outpace the competition, seize every opportunity and take share!

Former US President Donald Trump has said that if he wins the upcoming US elections, he plans to seek the prosecution of Google . Trump, who is running as the Republican presidential candidate, accused the tech giant of displaying only “bad stories” about him.According to a report by news agency Reuters, Trump shared this in a post on Truth Social – his own microblogging platform – but did not provide any evidence to support his claim about Google.Trump accused Google of having an illegal system.“It has been determined that Google has illegally used a system of only revealing and displaying bad stories about Donald J. Trump, some made up for this purpose while, at the same time, only revealing good stories about Comrade Kamala Harris,” he said.“This is an ILLEGAL ACTIVITY, and hopefully the Justice Department will criminally prosecute them for this blatant Interference of Elections. If not, and subject to the Laws of our Country, I will request their prosecution, at the maximum levels, when I win the Election, and become President of the United States!” he added.Trump previously made similar accusations against Google in 2019, Reuters said, citing the Washington Post.

What is this AI Pact all about

Over 100 tech companies, including Indian IT majors Tata Consultancy Service ( TCS ), Infosys and Wipro along with giants like Google Microsoft and Amazon have pledged their early compliance with the European Union’s (EU) AI rules, which came into law on August 1, through an AI Pact .The AI Pact essentially encourages and supports organisations to plan ahead for the implementation of AI Act measures.While some provisions of the AI Act are already fully applicable, it is to be noted that some rules for “high risk” systems will be enforced in the region in August 2027 – at the end of a transitional period (that is, the time between entry into force and date of applicability).The European Commission is promoting the AI Pact for which it called for interest by companies in November 2023, obtaining responses from over 550 organisations of various sizes, sectors, and countries.The European Commission recently gathered major industry players in Brussels to celebrate the first signatories of the EU AI Pact, a voluntary set of pledges aimed at promoting responsible AI development.Over 100 companies, including multinational corporations and European SMEs, have already signed on, representing diverse sectors like IT, healthcare, and finance. The AI Pact encourages these companies to take proactive steps towards compliance with the upcoming EU AI Act.These steps include implementing AI governance strategies, identifying high-risk AI systems, and promoting AI awareness among staff. Companies are also urged to tailor further commitments to their specific activities, such as ensuring human oversight of AI systems, mitigating potential risks, and transparently labelling AI-generated content like deepfakes.Facebook-parent Meta and Apple are not on the list of companies that have signed the AI Pact. ChatGPT-maker OpenAI has signed the pledge, despite its announcement last year saying it may ‘cease operating’ in the EU if it can’t comply with future regulation.","The European Commission recently gathered major industry players in Brussels to celebrate the first signatories of the EU AI Pact.

This includes a new fine imposed by the top court.According to a report by news agency Reuters, earlier this week, the Elon Musk-owned company informed the court that it had complied with orders to curb misinformation and requested the ban on its platform be lifted.In response to X’s reply, Judge Alexandre de Moraes responded on Friday (September 27) with a ruling that X and its legal representative in Brazil must still agree to pay a total of 18.3 million reais ($3.4 million) in pending fines that were previously ordered by the court.Moraes clarified that the court could utilise funds already frozen from X and Starlink accounts in Brazil, but this would require Starlink, also owned by Musk, to withdraw its appeal against the asset freeze.Furthermore, the judge levied an additional 10 million reais ($1.8 million) fine on X for a brief period last week when the platform became accessible to some users in Brazil, despite the ban.While X has yet to respond to a request for comment, a source close to the company told the news agency that they will likely pay all the fines but may challenge the extra 10 million reais fine.X's suspension in Brazil, which is one of its key markets, stems from late August when Moraes ruled that the platform had failed to comply with orders related to hate speech and the appointment of a local legal representative.Musk initially criticised these orders but later reversed his stance, and appointed a local representative.",X must pay over $5 million in outstanding fines before it can resume its services in the country.
