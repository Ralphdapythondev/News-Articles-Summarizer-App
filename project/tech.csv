35-year-old CEO shares biggest red flag he sees in employees: ‘The people that aren’t….’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/35-year-old-ceo-shares-biggest-red-flag-he-sees-in-employees-the-people-that-arent-/articleshow/113178212.cms,"Other hiring managers use similar techniques

What research shows

A 35-year-old CEO has sparked conversation by revealing what he considers to be the biggest red flag in employees. Everette Taylor , the CEO of Kickstarter , said that he values self-awareness in his employees above everything else. He believes that people without self-awareness tend to be ‘edo-driven’ and less willing to work with others.The CEO of crowdsourcing platform told CNBC that people without self-awareness are prone to “thinking inwardly about what they would want and what they think is best when it comes to customers,”.“I try to keep my ego at the door. I’m wrong all the time. I have an incredible team that’s super smart and will put me in my place, and I love that,” he added. He told the publication that he works on bullying his own self-awareness whenever possible.Intentionally tailors job questions to focus on self-awarenessTaylor said that he intentionally tailors job interview questions to focus on traits like self-awareness and ego control. He said that he asks about moments when the candidate got something wrong, or did something that failed. By asking these questions, he learns about the candidate’s ability to take accountability.“You can really tell,” says Taylor. “The people that aren’t self-aware, they really struggle with this.”The report quotes ex-Google VP Claire Hughes Johnson asking candidates “how their colleagues would describe them. If they only say good things, I probe what constructive feedback they’ve received.”Writing for Make It last year, she said, “Then I’ll say, ‘And what have you done to improve?’ to check their orientation towards learning and self-improvement, and to see whether they’ve taken that feedback to heart,”.Hughes Johnson said she listens closely for two words throughout any interviewee’s answers: Too many “I”s signify a lack of humility, and too many “we”s mean an inability to take credit appropriately.Researcher and author Tasha Eurich found in 2018 that the self-awareness trait can help you bolster your communication, relationships, creativity and productivity. However, while 95% of people believe they’re self-aware, only 10% to 15% genuinely are, the research shows.","Everette Taylor, CEO of Kickstarter, said that he values self-awareness in his employees above everything else.

How OpenAI CTO Mira Murati's mother’s first ChatGPT question is a 'classic mom' moment,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-openai-cto-mira-muratis-mothers-first-chatgpt-question-is-a-classic-mom-moment/articleshow/113173343.cms,"“When will Mira…?” she asked

What ChatGPT responded to Murati’s mother’s question

OpenAI CTO Mira Murati recently shared a funny incident about her mother's first encounter with ChatGPT – the company’s AI chatbot that is seen to be responsible for bringing AI technology into people’s hands. It turns out her mom's inaugural question was a classic one, essentially echoing the sentiments of Indian mothers.In a recent interview at Cannes Lions 2024, Murati was talking in the presence of creative and communications professionals.According to a report by Business Insider, she also spoke about what her mother’s first question to the AI chatbot was.Murati said that her mother asked ChatGPT, “When will Mira get married?”Murati's sister, who was helping their mother through that first encounter with the AI chatbot, responded, “Well, mom, it's not magic. It's still artificial intelligence,” Murati said.Murati noted that since ChatGPT enables skillful conversation, “she was having such a natural interaction with it that she thought she could ask anything,” Murati said.ChatGPT generated the response in a most chatbot-like way possible:“There is no public information about Mira Murati's personal plans, including if or when she intends to get married. Like many public figures, she tends to keep her private life out of the spotlight.”Born in Albania, Murati pursued her education in engineering and research, leading her to become a key player in the development of AI models like ChatGPT, DALL-E, and GPT-4.Murati was also the face when OpenAI launched GPT-4o – the company’s multimodal large language model that can take text, photo and video as input to generate responses.During her tenure at the company, she has also briefly served as the interim CEO of OpenAI, when OpenAI's board of directors ousted co-founder and CEO Sam Altman after the board had no confidence in his leadership.","Mira Murati's mother asked ChatGPT, “When will Mira get married?” Murati: “Well, mom, it's not magic.

A 15-year-old boy tragically lost his life after a botched gallbladder stone removal surgery performed by a fraudulent doctor in Saran district, Bihar . The doctor, identified as Ajit Kumar Puri, who allegedly relied on YouTube tutorials to guide the procedure, is currently at large.The teenager, admitted to Puri's clinic in Madhaura on Friday night due to vomiting and stomach pain, was operated on without his family's knowledge or consent.Alarmingly, the family alleges that Puri was performing the surgery while watching YouTube videos on his mobile phone.As the boy's condition worsened during the operation, the family expressed concern. Puri reportedly responded dismissively, ""Am I the doctor here or you?""Despite the deteriorating situation, Puri eventually decided to transport the boy to a hospital in Patna. However, the teenager passed away during the journey. Puri then fled the scene, leaving the boy's body behind.The family has filed a police complaint against Puri, accusing him of negligence, malpractice, and operating without proper qualifications or experience. They assert that his actions directly led to the teenager's untimely death.A case has been registered against the fake doctor and his clinic staff. Local police are conducting raids to apprehend the accused. The boy's body has been sent for a post-mortem examination.","A 15-year-old boy tragically lost his life after a botched gallbladder stone removal surgery performed by a fraudulent doctor in Saran district, Bihar.

Pavel Durov, CEO of Telegram , has recently become the subject of widespread speculation after older photos of him resurfaced online. These images have led many to wonder whether the billionaire entrepreneur underwent plastic surgery to enhance his appearance. Adding to the intrigue, Durov was recently arrested in France, raising further questions about the man behind the popular messaging app.Pavel Durov, a 39-year-old entrepreneur originally from Russia, is best known as the founder and CEO of Telegram, a messaging app launched in 2013.Telegram quickly gained popularity for its strong emphasis on user privacy, offering end-to-end encryption and other security features that set it apart from competitors. As of now, Forbes estimates Durov's net worth to be around $15.5 billion. Despite his success in the tech industry, Durov has managed to maintain a relatively low profile—until now.Durov's recent arrest in Paris has added a new layer of complexity to his public image. He was detained in France on charges of suspected complicity in running an online platform involved in illicit activities, including child exploitation, drug trafficking, and fraud. While these allegations are serious, it is the sudden focus on Durov's physical transformation that has captured the internet's attention.Pavel Durov has been active on social media platforms like Instagram since 2011, regularly sharing photos from his travels around the world. In his recent posts, Durov appears with a full head of hair and a toned physique, often posing shirtless in various locations. However, these recent images stand in stark contrast to older photos where Durov was seen with a noticeably receding hairline.The drastic change in his appearance has fueled rumours that Durov may have undergone plastic surgery, including a possible hair transplant. A popular post on X (formerly Twitter) by a well-known account shared a side-by-side comparison of Durov's old and new photos, sparking a flurry of online discussions. The post reads, ""Pavel Durov (Telegram CEO) before his hair transplant and plastic surgery,"" and has since gone viral.The speculation around Durov's transformation has been met with a variety of opinions online. On Reddit, users have debated whether the changes in Durov's appearance are the result of surgical procedures or simply better grooming and styling.One Reddit user commented, ""This isn't a hair transplant. His hair is too thick and full to have this kind of drastic change from a HT. Most likely he's wearing a hair system (wig).""Another user added, ""There's speculation that it's not a transplant, but rather a hair system because his hair loss was much more advanced in the first picture, so when the operation happens, the resulting hairdo never looks as full as his.""Some users believe the changes are the result of plastic surgery, with one theorising, ""This is well-done surgery.""However, not everyone is convinced that surgery is involved. One Reddit user opined, ""Honestly, I think a lot of the facial 'changes' are simply due to the much better angle and lighting in the second photo.""As the speculation continues, it's clear that Durov's transformation—whether natural or assisted—has caught the public's eye. The intense scrutiny of his appearance highlights the challenges that come with being in the spotlight, especially for someone as private as Durov. Whether or not he has undergone any procedures, the discussions around his looks reflect a broader societal fascination with image and success.","Pavel Durov, 39, is the founder and CEO of Telegram, a messaging app launched in 2013.

Elon Musk praised Ratan Tata

The legacy of the Tata Nano

Also read

In the realm of business and innovation, few figures command as much respect as Tata Group chairman emeritus Ratan Tata. His influence extends far beyond the Indian corporate world, even garnering admiration from Tesla CEO and X owner Elon Musk . In a 2009 interview with American journalist Charlie Rose , Musk praised Ratan Tata as a ""gentleman and a scholar."" This moment has recently resurfaced, shedding light on Musk's appreciation for Ratan Tata and his ambitious project, the Tata Nano .The Tata Nano was introduced by Tata Motors in 2008 as the world's cheapest car, with a price tag of just Rs 1 lakh (approximately $2,300 at the time). The car was a pet project of Ratan Tata, designed to make automobile ownership accessible to millions of Indians who had never been able to afford a car. The idea was revolutionary—a small, affordable car that would cater to the vast Indian middle class, providing them with a safe and efficient means of transportation.In the interview with Charlie Rose, which took place shortly after the launch of the Tata Nano, the Tesla CEO was asked about his views on Ratan Tata’s efforts to introduce a low-cost car in India. The interview clip, which has recently gone viral, captures Musk's candid response.""Take for a moment Ratan Tata, what he’s doing in India — developing a little sedan for $2300. Where do you put that in the whole equation of where the future of cars is?"" asked Rose.Musk responded with a mix of admiration and caution. He began by acknowledging the brilliance behind the Tata Nano project and the character of Ratan Tata himself.""I think it's a good idea to have affordable cars, but I think the problem with something like the Nano ... I wouldn't say problem because I think, by the way, it is probably a great idea and Ratan is a gentleman and scholar,"" Musk said.However, Musk also expressed his concerns about the long-term viability of such a low-cost vehicle, particularly in the context of rising fuel prices. He pointed out that while the initial purchase cost of the Nano was remarkably low, the cost of running the car—particularly fuel costs—could become a significant issue as gasoline prices continued to rise.""But where it’s going to become challenging in the future is when the price of gasoline rises, the cost of acquiring the car is much less of an issue than the cost of running the car,"" the billionnaire explained.Despite the initial excitement surrounding the Tata Nano, the car faced numerous challenges. One of the most significant issues was its branding. While the Nano was intended to be an affordable vehicle for the masses, it was often labeled as ""cheap"" rather than ""affordable."" This perception problem, combined with safety concerns and competition from other small cars, led to unimpressive sales figures.The Nano’s production was ultimately discontinued in 2018, marking the end of what was initially seen as a groundbreaking project. The car's journey from inception to discontinuation is often cited as one of the biggest marketing failures in the automobile industry.","The Tata Nano was introduced by Tata Motors in 2008 as the world's cheapest car, with a price tag of just Rs 1 lakh (approximately $2,300 at the time) The car was a pet project of Ratan Tata, designed to make automobile ownership accessible to millions of Indians who had never been able to afford a car.

Elon Musk criticizes Brazil ban on X



Delhi High Court warns Wikipedia

Ola CEO Bhavish Aggarwal has once again reiterated his stance on fostering the Indian technology sector. Aggarwal took to microblogging site X (formerly known as Twitter) to share his views on the latest report of Delhi High Court slamming Wikipedia over non-compliance with Indian laws.In the post, he wrote “Another proof of why we need to build our tech stack in India. These platforms don’t even comply with Indian laws and then even ignore court judgements!”.But he did not stop there.Aggarwal took aim at Elon Musk 's social media platform, Twitter, leveraging the Wikipedia incident to slam the platform. He said “Also, just look at Twitter’s arm twisting of the Brazilian Supreme Court .”“The more we ignore and justify, more we risk,” he further added.Recently, Brazil Supreme Court banned X after a protracted legal battle. The battle started in April this year when Judge de Moraes directed X to suspend several accounts alleged to be disseminating false information. X's refusal to follow this order resulted in the current suspension in addition to a penalty of 50,000 reais (approximately Rs. 7.47 lakh) for any efforts to bypass the ban, including the use of VPNs.Elon Musk reacted to the announcement with fury, dubbing Moraes as ‘evil dictator’.The Delhi High Court threatened Wikipedia to block the website if it doesn’t comply with India’s laws. Justice Navin Chawla delivered the warning during a hearing related to a defamation case filed by news agency ANI against Wikipedia.""If you don't like India, please don't work in India... We will ask government to block your site,"" Justice Chawla declared, as reported by legal news website Bar and Bench.","Ola CEO Bhavish Aggarwal took to X (formerly known as Twitter) to share his views on the latest report of Delhi High Court slamming Wikipedia over non- compliance with Indian laws.
