Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Z Flip 6 to launch soon: What we know so far



Samsung may have a new cooling solution for the upcoming Exynos chipsets that power smartphones. According to a report by The Elec, the South Korean tech giant is working on a new chip packaging technology to stop Exynos chipsets from facing overheating issues.Named fan-out wafer-level package-HPB ( FOWLP-HPB ), this tech involves attaching a type of heatsink, called a heat path block (HPB), to the top of the chipset.The report claims that this heatsink technology is derived from PCs and servers, and is expected to be used on the upcoming Exynos processors .As per the report, the tech is only arriving on smartphones now due to its smaller form factor. The report also suggests that miniaturising the technology was also a challenge.Samsung is expected to complete the development of the tech by Q4 2024 which will open the door to mass production. This timeline suggests that the technology may first arrive on the Exynos 2500 chipsets.The report claims that some Galaxy S25 models which may come powered by the Exynos 2500 chipsets is likely to be equipped with this cooling tech provided that development wraps by Q4.Exynos chipsets, starting with the latest Exynos 2400 as well as the older ones faced some heating and throttling issues. So this packaging technology is expected to help Exynos chips to offer more consistent performance, better battery life and cooler phones.Samsung's upcoming foldable phones, the Z Fold 6 and Z Flip 6, will release at the next Glaaxy Unpacked event which is set to be held on July 10. Both phones are expected to boast a durability improvement with an IP48 dust and water resistance rating.The Z Fold 6 is likely to feature massive displays (7.6-inch main, 6.3-inch cover) with a 120Hz refresh rate.

Why Zomato suspended “Legends” delivery

Zomato has suspended its hyperlocal goods delivery service ' Xtreme ', which it launched last year to compete with intracity small package delivery services providers Shadowfax, Porter and Loadshare. Separately, the Gurgaon-based company has relaunched its intercity food delivery offering ' Legends ' in a new avatar.Citing people aware of the matter, a report by The Economic Times said that the service is being discontinued on account of poor demand.“It was an experiment...a lot of restaurants do direct delivery and the company's feedback was that restaurants wanted a similar quality of experience for direct deliveries. That was the basis on which Xtreme was rolled out. But it was always an experiment and could have swung either way,” a company executive was quoted as saying.This service aimed to leverage Zomato's existing delivery network to provide intracity package deliveries across nearly all of the 750-800 cities where the company offers food delivery. However, it seems that it hasn't yielded the desired results. Zomato has also removed the dedicated Xtreme app from the Google Play Store.Zomato has reintroduced its ""Legends"" offering for intercity food delivery, albeit with a significant makeover.Zomato will deliver directly from renowned restaurants in select cities, however, the renewed focus on fresh deliveries will come at a cost. Zomato has introduced a minimum order value of Rs 5,000, potentially limiting its appeal to budget-conscious customers.The service is currently available in a few key cities like Delhi-NCR and Bengaluru, with plans for expansion in the near future, a person with knowledge of the matter told ET.In April this year, Zomato suspended intercity deliveries after it failed to generate much revenue for the company and traction among consumers, amid legal issues after a Delhi resident filed a case against it, challenging the company's promise of delivery from renowned restaurants in other cities.Zomato Legends was first launched in 2022 but last year, the company tweaked the model to deliver pre-stocked items from other cities with a shorter delivery timeline.","Zomato has suspended its hyperlocal goods delivery service'Xtreme ', which it launched last year to compete with intracity small package delivery services providers Shadowfax, Porter and Loadshare.

Apple MacBook Pro models with M4 chipsets: What to expect



Apple is expected to launch new MacBook Pro and MacBook Air models in the coming months. According to a report by Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, the rumoured MacBook Pro and MacBook Air machines are likely to come powered by three variants of Apple’s M4 chipsets -- the base M4, M4 Pro and M4 Max chipsets. The report also notes that the upgraded MacBooks may retain their predecessor's designs and may even offer new features through an AI subscription service which is expected to boost sales.Rumours suggest that Apple will soon release 14-inch and 16-inch models of MacBook Pros with M4 chips by the end of this year or early next year. Moreover, MacBook Air sizes are also in line for an early 2025 refresh.Currently, the only Apple devices with the M4 chip are the newest iPad Pro models . The most affordable option is the 11-inch iPad Pro with 256GB of storage which was launched at Rs 99,900.Gurman claims that both the MacBook Pro and MacBook Air won't see any design changes despite getting upgraded to the M4 chipsets. This comes after the 2021 redesign of the MacBook Pro with the M1 chip.He also suggested that a more significant visual overhaul might be coming in 2026, potentially coinciding with the adoption of OLED displays similar to the latest iPad Pro models.Similarly, the MacBook Air is also expected to wait until 2027 for a design refresh, five years after it departs from the wedge shape.Gurman acknowledges that a chip upgrade alone might not be enough to entice existing MacBook users to upgrade.To address this, Apple is reportedly considering a monthly subscription service that builds upon the free Apple Intelligence launching this fall.Additionally, Gurman claims Apple might integrate and potentially take a commission on third-party AI services like ChatGPT, mirroring their App Store model.",Apple is expected to launch new MacBook Pro and MacBook Air models in the coming months.

Credit card fraud involves cybercriminals obtaining sensitive credit card information such as the card number, PIN, CVV, and other necessary details to make unauthorised purchases or transfers.While credit card fraud detection systems can aid in identifying fraudulent transactions to some extent, fraudsters often manage to inflict substantial financial harm on victims before being apprehended.Therefore, it's crucial to familiarise oneself with various types of credit card fraud and take proactive measures to avoid becoming a victim.

Apple iPhone 16 series rumours

Apple iPhone 16 series is expected to launch in September and in the run up to the debut, the rumour mill is already churning out scores of leaks. According to another such leak, iPhone 16 Pro Max is expected to get a boost in battery life .Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has said that the Cupertino-based giant is increasing the energy density of the battery cells of iPhone 16 Pro Max, which will result in longer battery life.“My latest supply chain survey indicates the energy density (Wh/kg) of the battery cells of iPhone 16 Pro Max will increase, which has the benefit of longer battery life with the same battery size or lower battery size with the same battery life,” he said in a post.However, with increase in energy density of the battery cells, there will be an increase in temperature when running. To tackle this, Apple will use the stainless steel battery case .“Increasing the energy density of the battery cells will increase the battery temperature when running. To avoid overheating the battery, Apple uses the stainless steel battery case for the first time as a thermal solution ,” Kuo said.While stainless steel may not be as effective as aluminium in dissipating heat, “it is more robust and less susceptible to corrosion, so in addition to dissipating heat, the stainless steel battery case provides better protection for the battery and the iPhone system.”Kuo noted that the use of a stainless steel battery case will reduce the difficulty of removing the battery, hence, helping Apple to “comply with the European Union’s requirements for mobile phone batteries’ replaceability in the future.”“If the mass production of this new battery design (upgraded energy density of battery cells & adoption of the stainless steel battery case) goes well and the feedback is favourable, this new battery design will be adopted in all 2H25 new iPhone models,” Kuo noted.The iPhone 16 series is rumoured to replace physical buttons with touch-sensitive buttons that simulate a press with haptic feedback. The camera layout might shift to a vertical design, unlike the current diagonal setup. The customisable Action button, currently on Pro models, might be available on all iPhone 16 models.Under the hood, the standard iPhone 16 and Plus models might use the A18 chip , while Pro models could get the A18 Pro chip. Meanwhile, the display size for iPhone 16 and Plus (6.1-inch and 6.7-inch) might remain the same, but the refresh rate could improve.","iPhone 16 Pro Max is expected to get a boost in battery life.

I am now a regular person who no longer dreams of becoming an idol. I met my girlfriend after the program ended, and we are seriously discussing marriage.
