"UPI, ATM services resume for 300 small banks as NPCI restores network after ransomware attack",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/upi-atm-services-resume-for-300-small-banks-as-npci-restores-network-after-ransomware-attack/articleshow/112211165.cms,"Here’s what NPCI’s statement on X reads

NPCI connectivity with C-Edge Technologies Ltd. has been re-established following security review by an independent forensic auditing firm. Investigation confirms that the impacted systems have been isolated by C-Edge to contain potential spread of the ransomware. Further, necessary security review and scans have been conducted by the auditor to ensure that rest of the infrastructure is clean.

The impact was limited to C-Edge systems hosted in their data center and not on any of the co-operative banks or regional rural banks' own infrastructure. The services of co-operative banks and regional rural banks, which were dependent on C-Edge, have now been restored. With this, respective banks shall be able to offer a full range of services seamlessly to their customers, as it was before.

The National Payments Corporation of India ( NPCI ) says it has restored connectivity with C-Edge Technologies after a ransomware attack earlier this week.The attack, attributed to the RansomEXX group , had primarily impacted Brontoo Technology Solutions, a key collaborator with C-Edge, a joint venture between TCS and SBI . The security breach forced the temporary shutdown of payment systems across small Indian local banks.Customers of nearly 300 Regional Rural Banks and cooperative banks were unable to access key payment-related services like fund transfers using the NEFT or UPI route or ATM withdrawals.In a post titled ‘NPCI connectivity with C-Edge Technologies re-established’, NPCI said that the connection was re-established following a security review by an independent forensic auditing firm. The post was shared on microblogging site X, formerly known as Twitter.According to a Economic Times report, NPCI has directed C-Edge Technologies to hire a forensic auditor to fully review its systems and this incident and submit a report within two months. The report quotes an unnnamed person aware of the matter who said “NPCI has received a preliminary report about the incident, C-Edge has also been asked to submit a forensic audit within two months,”.","The National Payments Corporation of India ( NPCI ) says it has restored connectivity with C-Edge Technologies after a ransomware attack earlier this week.

Key findings of the ASCI report

A new study by the Advertising Standards Council of India ( ASCI ) Academy and Parallel HQ has revealed the use of deceptive design patterns (or dark patterns ) in popular Indian apps. The report, titled “Conscious Patterns,” analysed 53 apps and found that 52 employed at least one deceptive practice.In the study, ASCI defines dark patterns as deceptive UI/UX practices that can mislead or trick users into doing something they originally did not intend or want to do.These patterns include privacy deception , interface interference, drip pricing and false urgency, which can manipulate user behaviour.“It is important to note that the widespread use of dark patterns can impact user autonomy and informed decision-making,” the report said. The study also highlights the need for more ethical app design and underscores the importance of consumer protection.The apps are spread across 9 industries and the report does not provide app-specific data . However, it does provide the list of apps it analysed.Ola, Uber, inDrive, RapidoSwiggy, Zomato, Dunzo, Zepto, Borzo, BlinkIt, PorterBig Basket, Nike, Amazon, Flipkart, Myntra, Ajit, Tira, Tata Cliq, MeeshoPrime Video, Netflix, Disney+Hotstar, YouTube, JioCinemaPaytm, Cred, PhonePe, Groww, ZerodhaAgoda, Goibibo, EaseMyTrip, Yatra, Makemytrip, Cleartrip, Redbus, Booking.comVedanta, UpGrad, Byju’s, Unacademy, PhysicswallahDream11, Subway Surfers, Teen Patti Gold, Candy Crush, Ludo KingTata 1mg, Cure.fit, PharmEasy, HealthifyMe, PractoASCI report says that out of the 53 top apps in India that researchers analysed, 52 out of them use deceptive patterns .“These apps collectively have been downloaded over 21 billion times, pointing to the potential of their consumer impact,” the report added.The findings have raised concerns about user autonomy and the potential impact on consumer decision-making. The study also offers alternative design practices and a scoring tool to help developers create more ethical apps.The report found that four deceptive patterns accounted for 78% of the total occurrences - privacy deception (24%), drip pricing (19%), interface interference (18%), and false urgency (17%).It said that more than 80% of apps exhibited deceptive patterns in the settings/ profile section. All e-commerce apps studied made it difficult for users to delete their accounts.While some health-tech apps—4/5, relied on creating time-based pressure (false urgency) to rush users into making decisions, basket sneaking was four times more prevalent in delivery and logistics apps as compared to other sectors.The report also found that the three sectors with the highest deceptive patterns per app were health-tech at 8.8, travel booking at 7.2, and e-commerce at 5.3. The lowest incidences of deceptive patterns per app were observed in streaming services at 1.8 and in the gaming sector at 2.4.The report comes on the heels of guidelines issued by the Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI) and the Department of Consumer Affairs (DoCA) on deceptive patterns. Industry body Nasscom is collaborating with ASCI and Parallel to address this issue and promote responsible app development.","ASCI report says that out of the 53 top apps in India that researchers analysed, 52 out of them use deceptive patterns.

Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGGI) is the apex intelligence and investigative agency for matters relating to violation of the Goods & Services Tax, Central Excise Duty and Service Tax.The controversy erupted started on July 31 when the tax authorities accused Infosys of evading GST on services received from its overseas branches between 2017 and 2022. The company strongly denied the allegations, citing a recent government circular that exempts such services from GST. Infosys had strongly argued that GST payments are eligible for credit or refund against export of IT services.The massive demand had sent shockwaves through the IT industry, with Nasscom raising concerns about the impact on business sentiment.

A few quick updates about safety at OpenAI:

As we said last July, we’re committed to allocating at least 20% of the computing resources to safety efforts across the entire company.

Our team has been working with the

US AI Safety Institute

on an agreement where we would provide early access to our next foundation model so that we can work together to push forward the science of AI evaluations. excited for this!

Finally, we want current and former employees to be able to raise concerns and feel comfortable doing so. This is crucial for any company, but for us especially and an important part of our safety plan. In May, we voided non-disparagement terms for current and former employees and provisions that gave OpenAI the right (although it was never used) to cancel vested equity. We've worked hard to make it right.

OpenAI has said that it is dedicated to making sure its powerful AI tools don’t cause harm. Responding to questions from US lawmakers, the company noted that its employees have ways to raise concerns about safety practices, Bloomberg reported.

"Reddit CEO calls out Microsoft and other AI companies, says blocking them 'a real pain in the a*s'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/reddit-ceo-calls-out-microsoft-and-other-ai-companies-says-blocking-them-a-real-pain-in-the-as/articleshow/112199954.cms,"Reddit CEO Steve Huffman has called out Microsoft and other AI companies for using Reddit's data to train their artificial intelligence models without permission or compensation. In a recent interview with The Verge, Huffman described efforts to block these companies as ""a real pain in the ass.""""We've had Microsoft, Anthropic , and Perplexity act as though all of the content on the internet is free for them to use,"" Huffman told The Verge.He specifically criticized Microsoft for using Reddit's data ""without telling us"" to train its AI and summarize content in Bing search results.Huffman explained the rationale behind blocking these companies: ""Without these agreements, we don't have any say or knowledge of how our data is displayed and what it's used for, which has put us in a position now of blocking folks who haven't been willing to come to terms with how we'd like our data to be used or not used.""In early July, Reddit updated its robots.txt file to block web crawlers from companies without agreements. This resulted in Reddit results disappearing from Microsoft's Bing search engine while remaining visible on Google.Huffman argued that the traditional value exchange between search engines and content platforms has evolved. ""When it was used for simple search, to create simple links that would send us traffic from search engines, that was fine,"" he told Bloomberg. ""But now folks are using Reddit data for training, they're reselling it, they're doing search summaries instead of linking to us.""He further elaborated to The Verge, ""I think the traditional value exchange from search engines has changed. Search and summarization and training are merging, and the value exchange of crawling in exchange for traffic back is becoming muddied.""Reddit has already struck deals with Google and OpenAI , allowing them to access its data for a fee. Google reportedly agreed to pay $60 million annually for this access. So, Microsoft’s Bing and other search engines apparently don’t have the access to Reddit, so they can’t show the result in their search.Microsoft's head of search, Jordi Ribas, responded on social media platform X that ""Reddit has blocked Bing from crawling their site for search, favoring another search engine and impacting competition from Bing and Bing-powered engines."" However, a Microsoft spokesperson stated that the company honors websites' directions regarding content usage for AI models.The Reddit CEO pointed to OpenAI's recent SearchGPT announcement as a model for future agreements. However, Reddit spokesperson Tim Rathschmidt clarified that none of the site's existing content deals are exclusive.While Anthropic told the Verge that Reddit has been on their block list for web crawling since mid-May, Microsoft and Perplexity did not comment on the matter.Huffman's stance sends a clear message: the era of freely scraping online content for AI training may be coming to an end. ""The traditional value exchange from search engines has changed,"" he emphasized.","Reddit CEO Steve Huffman has called out Microsoft and other AI companies for using Reddit's data to train their AI models without permission or compensation.

Anand Mahindra on AI: …is going to be of significantly more value to us than we imagined,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/anand-mahindra-on-ai-is-going-to-be-of-significantly-more-value-to-us-than-we-imagined/articleshow/112095975.cms,"How X users reacted to Anand Mahindra’s post

Anand Mahindra said that artificial intelligence (AI) can be of more value to mankind than ‘imagined’. Citing a research that showed how AI can detect breast cancer five years before it develops, he wrote ""If this is accurate, then AI is going to be of significantly more value to us than we imagined and much earlier than we had imagined,"".The Mahindra Group chairman took to microblogging platform X (formerly known as Twitter) to share his views.Recently, a team of researchers from Duke University in the US developed a new AI model to predict 5-year breast cancer risk from mammograms.Traditional cancer diagnosis relies on biopsies, microscopic histological examinations, and imaging techniques like MRI, CT, and PET scans. Human interpretation of these tests can be subjective. AI, on the other hand, can analyse medical images with staggering accuracy.An IANS report quotes Vineet Nakra, a radiation oncologist at Max Super Speciality Hospital on how AI is helping in cancer diagnosis and treatment. She told the news agency that AI is helping pathologists diagnose cancer much faster and paving the way for doctors to make personalised and patient-centric cancer care.Commenting on Mahindra’s X post, a user wrote “That's the best use of technology anyway. Assisting human kind to become better and reduce risks”. “AI in the medical field will have a huge impact and will certainly make significant contributions. Google DeepMind's AI system, AlphaFold3, can accurately predict the 3D structure of proteins and has potential applications in drug discovery and understanding diseases,” commented another.“AI, Machine Learning, Big data analysis based systems will drastically improve the living standards of life of every strata of society,” replied a third.","The Mahindra Group chairman took to microblogging platform X to share his views.

IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw stated that neither WhatsApp nor its parent company Meta have informed the government of any plans to shut down their services in India. He made this statement in response to a question raised in the Rajya Sabha recently.“[The] Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) has shared that WhatsApp or Meta has not informed the government about any such plans,” Vaishnaw said in a written reply to a question by Congress member Vivek Tankha, as per PTI report on Friday (July 26).Tankha had asked whether WhatsApp was planning to shut its services in India due to the government's directives to share user details in accordance with the government directions under Section 69A of the Information Technology Act, 2000.Responding to Tankha's question on curbs on social media platforms, the I&B minister said the central government issued directions in the interest of the sovereignty or integrity of India, defence of India, security of the state, friendly relations with foreign states or public order or for preventing incitement to the commission of any cognisable offence relating to above in respect of the information on a computer resource.Earlier this year, WhatsApp told the Delhi High Court that it will stop functioning in India if it is compelled by the government to break encryption of messages.Previously, WhatsApp challenged the newly amended IT Rules saying that they violate the right to privacy and were unconstitutional. WhatsApp told the Delhi High Court that its end-to-end encryption protects user privacy by ensuring only the sender and recipient can access message content.“As a platform, we are saying, if we are told to break encryption, then WhatsApp goes,” Tejas Karia, appearing for Whatsapp, told a Division Bench. He added that people use WhatsApp because of the privacy features that it offers.“India (is) a country that’s at the forefront...

For phones manufactured in India, only the 18% GST is applied. Apple imports its iPhone Pro and Pro Max models, while its other smartphones are produced locally.Post this announcement, Apple has reduced prices of iPhones in India. While the price cut on base models non-Pro is almost negligible at Rs 300, the cut on high end Pro models is up to Rs 6,000. Here are the new prices of iPhones as they appear on Apple's official store in India.Apple has already updated its website with the new prices of the iPhone.

CrowdStrike outage: Microsoft now wants to keep away the access of Windows Kernel from these companies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/crowdstrike-outage-microsoft-now-wants-to-keep-away-the-access-of-windows-kernel-from-these-companies/articleshow/112057428.cms,"Following a major outage caused by a faulty CrowdStrike update last week, Microsoft is pushing for significant changes to Windows security architecture. The incident, which impacted 8.5 million PCs, has led Microsoft to reassess the resilience of its operating system and consider restricting kernel-level access for third-party security vendors .John Cable, Microsoft's vice president of program management for Windows servicing and delivery, outlined the company's stance in a blog post titled ""Windows resiliency: Best practices and the path forward."" Cable emphasised the need for ""end-to-end resilience"" and hinted at potential changes that could restrict kernel access for security software.The CrowdStrike update bug, which resulted in widespread system crashes, has highlighted the risks associated with allowing third-party applications to operate at the kernel level. This privileged access, while beneficial for threat detection, can lead to catastrophic failures if errors occur.Microsoft is now exploring alternatives that don't rely on kernel access, such as VBS enclaves and the Azure Attestation service. These technologies, which utilize Zero Trust approaches, could provide enhanced security without the risks associated with kernel-level operations.The tech giant's push for change may face resistance from cybersecurity vendors and regulators. A similar attempt to restrict kernel access in Windows Vista in 2006 was met with opposition. In contrast, Apple successfully locked down kernel access in macOS in 2020.Microsoft's approach involves collaboration with partners and the broader security community. The company aims to balance improved system resilience with the needs of security vendors who have historically relied on kernel-level access for their products.Microsoft's response to the CrowdStrike incident also included deploying over 5,000 support engineers to assist affected organizations and providing ongoing updates through the Windows release health dashboard. The company has emphasized the importance of business continuity planning, secure data backups, and utilizing cloud-native approaches for managing Windows devices to enhance resilience against future incidents.","Microsoft is pushing for changes to its Windows security architecture.

SearchGPT in testing phase right now

What OpenAI said about SearchGPT

OpenAI to take on Microsoft Bing and Perplexity, along with Google

SearchGPT may look like Google Overview

(With agency inputs)

OpenAI is testing an artificial intelligence-powered search engine that can access information from across the internet in real time. The prominent AI startup revealed the new prototype, SearchGPT , in a blog post earlier this week. OpenAI plans to integrate its new search engine technology with its existing online chatbot, ChatGPT. In a blog post, Microsoft-backed OpenAI said that the company plans to integrate the best features from the search tool into ChatGPT in the future.Here are the key things to know about SearchGPT.The company said it was testing the technology with a small group of users as well as online publishers who partnered with OpenAI to help build the search engine.“Getting answers on the web can take a lot of effort, often requiring multiple attempts to get relevant results,” the company said in its blog post. “We believe that by enhancing the conversational capabilities of our models with real-time information from the web, finding what you’re looking for can be faster and easier,” it added. Users will be able to interact with SearchGPT through conversational queries, and can ask follow-up questions as they might if speaking to a person, OpenAI said.Other than the search giant Google , SearchGPT launch, announced earlier this week, places the AI giant in competition with its largest backer Microsoft's Bing search and emerging services such as Perplexity — a search-focused AI chatbot firm backed by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and semiconductor giant Nvidia . According to web analytics firm Statcounter, Google dominates the search engine market with a 91.1% share as of June 2024.Google recently added AI-generated query result summaries -- referred to as ""Overviews"" -- to its search engine. This new feature offers written text at the top of results for Google searches, ahead of the traditional links to websites, which summarizes information that the engine believes answers the user's search query. The description shared by OPenAI of SearchGPT appears similar to Google's Overviews.","OpenAI is testing an artificial intelligence-powered search engine that can access information from across the internet in real time.

How X’s auto-consent flouts tech rules in the UK, EU

Elon Musk-owned X recently enabled by default a setting that allows the social media platform to utilise user data to train its AI model, Grok. This means X can use user posts, interactions, and outputs from Grok for training and refining its AI, requiring users to manually opt-out. Now the regulators in the UK and the European Union ( EU ) have reportedly connected with the company over its alleged attempt to gain user consent for data harvesting without their approval.While X claims this data is essential for improving user experience, privacy concerns have been raised. The setting states that users “allow your posts as well as your interactions, inputs and results with Grok to be used for training and fine-tuning”.Users have expressed difficulty in disabling this feature as the option is currently hidden within the web app's settings and unavailable on the mobile app.The move contradicts the tech laws in both the regions as the regulations prohibit pre-ticked consent boxes. Tech companies are not allowed to use “pre-ticked boxes” or “any other method of default consent”.Data protection authorities in the UK and Ireland have expressed their concerns over X's actions, as per a report by the Guardian. The UK's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) is investigating the matter, emphasising the importance of transparency and user choice in data usage.“Platforms seeking to use their users’ data to train their AI foundation models must be transparent about their activities,” said a spokesperson for the ICO.“They should take steps to proactively notify users well in advance of using data for these purposes, and provide people with ample time and simple processes to object to having their data used in this way,” the spokesperson added.Similarly, Ireland's Data Protection Commission (DPC), the lead regulator for X in the EU, has expressed surprise at the development and is seeking further information from the company.“The DPC has been engaging with X on this matter for a number of months, with our latest interaction occurring as recently as yesterday, therefore we are surprised by today’s developments. We have followed up with X today (July 26) and are awaiting a response. We expect further engagement early next week,” said Graham Doyle, a DPC deputy commissioner.","X recently enabled by default a setting that allows the social media platform to utilise user data to train its AI model, Grok.

Karnataka reservation bill: PhonePe CEO and founder Sameer Nigam issues this 'personal statement',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/karnataka-reservation-bill-phonepe-ceo-and-founder-sameer-nigam-issues-this-personal-statement/articleshow/111908948.cms,"Read PhonePe CEO Sameer Nigam’s personal note

“PhonePe was born in Bengaluru and we are incredibly proud of our roots in this city, which is well known for its world-class technology talent and vibrant diversity. From Bengaluru, over the past decade we have expanded across the length and breadth of India and been able to deliver secure and efficient digital payments for over 55 Crore Indians.

Bengaluru's reputation as the ""Silicon valley of India"" is truly well-deserved. The city thrives on an incredible culture of innovation, and attracts the most brilliant young minds from Karnataka and the rest of India. As a company, we are deeply grateful for the supportive business environment that Karnataka’s governments and its local

Kannadiga

populace have offered us. Without such an inclusive ecosystem and progressive policies, Bengaluru would not have become a global technology superpower.

As a company we also thrive on celebrating diversity, we have always tried hard to deliver fair, unbiased and meritocracy-based employment opportunities for all Indians - including to all local Kannadigas. We believe such an approach gives every Indian a good job a chance to shine, and ultimately helps create more societal and economic value for Bengaluru, Karnataka and India.

I read some recent media articles, relating to a few personal comments that I made last week regarding the draft job reservation bill. I would first and foremost like to clarify that it was NEVER my intention to insult Karnataka and it’s people. If my comments hurt anyone’s sentiments in such a way, I am truly sorry and would like to offer you an unconditional apology. I have the highest regard for Kannada, and all other Indian languages. In fact, I truly believe that linguistic diversity and rich cultural heritage is a national asset that all Indians should be proud of; and all Indians should be respectful of and celebrate local and cultural norms.

Bengaluru’s Indian startups are competing against trillion dollar giants like Google, Apple, Amazon and Microsoft. To do so, these companies must be able to employ the very best talent available in India purely based on their technology skills and proficiency in fields such as Coding, Design, Product Management, Data Sciences, Machine Learning, AI and beyond. As a nation, that is the only way we can build world-class companies that can compete in the global village that we live in today.

I also want to help create lakhs of jobs for Bengaluru and Karnataka. And, I believe with more dialogue and discussion, we can find ways to create more sustainable employment avenues. Let’s all work together to do this meaningfully and while creating long-term impact.”

PhonePe CEO Sameer Nigam issued a personal note following backlash over his comments on Karnataka 's job reservation bill. The controversy erupted after Nigam criticised the bill on social media platform X, questioning whether his children deserved jobs in their home city given his company's pan-India job creation.""If my comments hurt anyone's sentiments, I am truly sorry and would like to offer you an unconditional apology,"" Nigam said in a statement.He emphasised his 22-year connection to Bengaluru and respect for linguistic diversity.The Karnataka Cabinet had recently approved a bill mandating 50% reservation for locals in management roles and 70% in non-management positions within private companies. The bill, which also proposed 100% quota for locals in certain government jobs, was put on hold after industry backlash.Nigam stressed the need for merit-based hiring to build globally competitive companies.
