Apple has long covered tiny cracks on your iPhone or Apple Watch displays under the standard warranty but this may change soon. According to a report, the company is bringing notable changes to its repair policies with respect to iPhone and Apple Watch.Citing multiple sources, a report by 9to5mac claims that Apple may not treat ‘single hairline cracks’ on the display of iPhones and Apple Watch models under standard warranty. It said that the repairs will be processed as “accidental damage” claims, and users are required to pay to get the displays fixed.Before this month, Apple's warranty covered iPhones and Apple Watches with a single hairline crack, as long as there were no other cracks or dents and it wasn't clear how the crack happened/ appeared.The company has reportedly updated Apple Stores and Apple Authorised Service Providers this week, telling them about the ‘new’ policy that all instances of single hairline cracks are no longer covered by warranty.“When a customer reports a single hairline crack as a symptom, the service provider is required to process it as an accidental damage claim,” the report added.The change in policy means that users will have to pay to get a single hairline crack repaired, even if there is no other damage or point of impact on the iPhone or Apple Watch. Notably, Apple is still covering single hairline crack repairs under warranty for iPad and Mac.As per iPhone Screen Repair landing page and repair cost calculator, an estimated cost of repairing an iPhone 15 screen is Rs 25,500. “We’ll check your service coverage to determine the final service fee,” the company says. Those with an AppleCare+ plan can use its benefits with a fee of Rs 2,500.","Apple may not treat ‘single hairline cracks’ under standard warranty.

When is the redesign going live for users

Netflix is rolling out its biggest TV app redesign in over ten year. The streaming platform is rolling out the first major revamp of its television app. This goal is to make it easier for users to find something to watch. This comes as Netflix looks to increase engagement time and potentially attract subscribers to its new ad-supported tiers.Netflix's research revealed that users were spending a lot of time scanning the home screen, a phenomenon they dubbed ""eye gymnastics."" They found viewers' eyes darting between title rows, trending sections, artwork, trailers, and synopses.""We really wanted to make that simpler, more intuitive, everything easier to navigate,"" said Pat Flemming, senior director of member product, to Reuters.Thumbnails for shows and movies are now bigger, making them easier to see and potentially more enticing to click on.Information is presented in a more streamlined way, highlighting key details like whether a title was ""in the top 10 for 8 weeks"".A new section curates content specific to the user, including shows and movies they've started watching or saved to their list.The menu has moved from the left side of the screen to the top for easier access, with core options like ""Home,"" ""Shows,"" ""Movies,"" and ""My Netflix"".This Netflix redesign is reportedly currently being tested with a limited group of the company's nearly 270 million subscribers. The company plans to use feedback to potentially refine the design before a wider rollout.The focus on engagement time reflects a larger shift at Netflix. They view it as a better measure of customer satisfaction than just subscriber numbers, which they plan to stop reporting regularly next year.",Netflix is rolling out its biggest TV app redesign in over ten years.

"How Reliance Jio, Airtel and Vodafone-Idea's this big 'WhatsApp' problem may be easing",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-reliance-jio-airtel-and-vodafone-ideas-this-big-whatsapp-problem-may-be-easing/articleshow/110776159.cms,"What shows the big shift away from WhatsApp

Why the shift from WhatsApp is more than about money

The Amazon order delivery updates that came via SMS moved to WhatsApp sometime last year. Similarly, there are some other enterprise updates to customers that are now sent through WhatsApp instead of SMS. This transition did not go quite well with the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), the body that represents India’s top three telecom companies -- Airtel, Reliance Jio and Vodafone-Idea. In a letter to telecom ministry, COAI accused global technology giants, such as Microsoft and Amazon, of ""presumably circumventing and bypassing the legal telecom route"" by using WhatsApp to send enterprise messages to customers. The letter claimed that this caused a likely Rs 3,000-crore annual revenue loss to both the Centre and the service providers.It seems, things may change for Indian telecom service providers. According to a report in Economic Times, major tech companies including Amazon, Google, and Microsoft are moving away from WhatsApp for sending one-time passwords (OTPs) to their customers in India. This shift comes just two months after Meta , the owner of WhatsApp, introduced new pricing and regulations for sending international authentication messages.The report states that this switch has resulted in a significant increase in international SMS traffic for Indian telecom operators. Data suggests a 50-70% surge in monthly volumes since March, with Meta (WhatsApp, Facebook, and Instagram ) still being the leading contributor.""We've seen a rise in international SMS volumes from large clients who prefer the reliable and widespread reach of SMS,"" said Rajdip Gupta, managing director of Route Mobile, a cloud communications company, as quoted in the Economic Times report. ""It's important to remember that traditional telecom channels like SMS and voice calls offer an added layer of security by preventing exchange of user data between competing tech firms.""While neither Meta nor telecom companies like Bharti Airtel, Reliance Jio, and Vodafone Idea have commented on the issue, experts believe the shift is driven by more than just cost.In March, WhatsApp introduced a new category named ""authentication-international"" specifically for OTPs sent by international firms operating in India and Indonesia. This category carried a price tag of Rs 2.3 per message, a twenty-fold increase from previous rates, but still cheaper than standard SMS fees.However, analysts suggest that the bigger concern for these tech giants, which are direct competitors of Facebook-parent Meta, is the requirement to disclose their primary business location when sending messages through WhatsApp.Business location has been a contentious point between tech companies like Amazon and Google, and telecom operators in India. The lack of a clear definition for ""international traffic"" within telecom regulations is at the heart of this dispute. Telecom operators classify these companies as foreign entities due to their overseas servers, while the tech firms argue that they are registered Indian businesses with locally generated SMS messages traveling on domestic networks.Nitin Singhal, managing director of communications service provider Sinch, offered his perspective in the report, stating, ""The true impact of the new authentication category, which goes live in July, on the market remains to be seen.""","Major tech companies including Amazon, Google, and Microsoft are moving away from WhatsApp for sending one-time passwords (OTPs) to their customers in India.

The iPhone 16 Pro is expected to feature a 6.3-inch display instead of 6.1-inch. And, the iPhone 16 Pro Max is rumoured to come with a 6.9-inch display which will make the iPhone 16 Pro Max to offer the biggest display ever on an iPhone.Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max with a slightly bigger display, is expected to come with a slightly taller design.

As India undergoes its largest democratic exercise, the Lok Sabha Elections 2024 , WhatsApp’s Tipline has emerged as a crucial tool for combating the spread of deepfakes and misinformation. Created by the Misinformation Combat Alliance’s (MCA) Deepfakes Analysis Unit (DAU), the Tipline aims to raise public awareness and provide assistance in identifying AI-manipulated content.: Launched in March 2024, WhatsApp’s Tipline has quickly become a trusted resource for users seeking to verify the authenticity of images and videos. Since its inception, the Tipline has received hundreds of messages from users asking for help in distinguishing real from fake content.: The Tipline is accessible in multiple languages, including Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, and English, making it widely usable across India’s diverse linguistic landscape.Users can flag suspected deepfake content by sending audio notes or videos to the Tipline. The process is listed below:Most of the manipulated content received involves doctored videos where the original audio is altered using AI to make a person appear to say something they did not. These videos often feature prominent figures such as actors, businessmen, politicians, and TV anchors. Additionally, AI-created memes of politicians using face-blending techniques or other less sophisticated methods have been commonly reported.WhatsApp’s Tipline uses advanced generative AI to analyze and detect deepfakes. This involves reconstructing the mouth movements of subjects to sync with altered audio, making the deepfakes appear more convincing.Pamposh Raina, Head of the DAU, emphasized the collaborative nature of the DAU’s approach. By partnering with detection and forensic experts, the DAU supports its fact-checking partners who play a critical role in this project. Raina stated, “The strength of the DAU lies in the collaborative model which it is building by partnering with detection and forensic experts. Our goal is to drive public awareness on the issue of algorithm-based fabrication, and I am confident that this symbiotic model can be replicated globally to combat misinformation spread through audio and video content produced using generative AI.”The successful implementation of WhatsApp’s Tipline during the Lok Sabha elections 2024 highlights the potential of such tools in combating misinformation. As deepfake technology continues to evolve, the need for robust detection and public awareness mechanisms becomes increasingly critical. WhatsApp’s initiative sets a precedent for similar efforts worldwide, showcasing how technology and collaboration can effectively address the challenges posed by AI-generated misinformation.",WhatsApp’s Tipline uses advanced generative AI to analyze and detect deepfakes.

During summer months, many households experience a significant increase in electricity consumption due to higher cooling needs. While staying comfortable during hot weather is essential, it doesn't have to come at the cost of soaring electricity bills. By implementing strategic energy-saving practices, you can reduce your summer electricity expenses without sacrificing comfort.Here you can explore several effective ways to save on summer electricity bills, offering practical tips and strategies that can help you minimise energy consumption and lower your utility costs during the warmer months. From optimising your cooling system to adopting energy-efficient habits, these recommendations are designed to make a noticeable impact on your electricity expenses while keeping your home cool and comfortable.Let's delve into these actionable tips that can help you save money and energy throughout the summer season.The Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) issues BEE Star Labels as a voluntary method for manufacturers to indicate an appliance's energy efficiency. The label uses stars to indicate the efficiency of a product, with more stars indicating higher efficiency. Simply put, the higher the energy efficiency rating of the appliance, the lower its energy consumption. To effectively reduce your home's energy costs, opt for appliances with a 5-star BEE rating. Not only does this positively impact the environment, but it also helps lower your electricity bills. Explore Crompton's wide range of 5-star rated ceiling fans to learn more about BEE Rating Appliances.If your home still uses CFLs and incandescent bulbs, it's time to replace them with LED bulbs. LED bulbs are not just a trendy choice; they are recognized for their energy efficiency and superior illumination. If you're wondering how to reduce your electricity bill at home, switching to LED bulbs is the solution for you.Upgrading to smart appliances is a highly effective method to decrease electricity consumption at home. These devices allow you to automate tasks and manage energy usage efficiently. Consider installing energy-efficient ceiling fans to further reduce electricity consumption. Smart appliances typically come equipped with remote control capabilities, allowing you to schedule operations and conserve power.
