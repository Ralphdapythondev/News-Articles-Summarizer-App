Google Meet gets adaptive audio feature: What it is and how it works,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-meet-gets-adaptive-audio-feature-what-it-is-and-how-it-works/articleshow/110347756.cms,"What is adaptive audio feature

How to enable adaptive audio

Google announced a new feature called ""adaptive audio"" for Google Meet , aiming to eliminate the common problem of echo and feedback during meetings with multiple participants joining from the same physical location.Earlier, using multiple laptops or devices in Google Meet within the same room often resulted in audio issues. Microphone pickup on one device would capture the speaker output from another device, creating an unpleasant echo for all participants.Adaptive audio solves this problem by intelligently managing audio streams.Google Meet automatically detects when multiple devices in the same location are trying to join a meeting. It then synchronises the microphones and speakers of these devices to ensure clear and echo-free audio for everyone involved.Users can now collaborate seamlessly using Google Meet from conference rooms or huddle spaces equipped with multiple laptops, without worrying about disruptive audio issues. Along with this, the adaptive audio feature also eliminates the need to crowd around a single laptop for optimal audio pickup.The ""adaptive audio"" feature is automatically activated when Google Meet detects multiple devices from the same location joining a meeting. Users will see a notification in the ""People"" sidebar indicating ""Merged audio"" is active. While automatic for most scenarios, Google assures users will have some control over the feature, with the ability to disable it if needed.The ""adaptive audio"" feature is currently rolling out to Google Workspace customers with Gemini Enterprise, Gemini Business, Gemini Education, Gemini Education Premium plans, and those with the AI Meetings and Messaging add-on. A wider rollout to all Google Meet users is expected in the coming months.","Google Meet introduces ""adaptive audio"" feature to eliminate echo during meetings.

Google’s Call Screen feature

Truecaller has announced that it has partnered with Microsoft to bring the prowess of its Personal Voice technology from Microsoft Azure AI Speech to Truecaller’s AI Assistant. With the addition of Microsoft Azure AI Speech’s Personal Voice, users of the Truecaller Assistant can now create a digital version of their own voice to use inside the Assistant.With the Personal Voice feature from Microsoft Azure AI Speech in Truecaller, consumers will be able to record a few seconds of their own voice to create a digital voice, while setting up Truecaller Assistant. This means that those who have Assistant on the Truecaller app, can have their callers hear a replicated and authentic version of their voice instead of one of the many digital assistants on offer.“The personal voice feature allows our users to use their own voice, enabling the digital assistant to sound just like them when handling incoming calls. This groundbreaking capability not only adds a touch of familiarity and comfort for the users but also showcases the power of AI in transforming the way we interact with our digital assistants,” said Raphael Mimoun, product director and general manager, Truecaller Israel.It is to be noted that Truecaller Assistant, which was launched in September 2022, already offers AI technologies that can automatically answer phone calls, screen calls, take messages, or record the call for later viewing.Microsoft announced that its personal voice feature of Azure AI Speech is now generally available. This feature is designed to enable users to create and use their own AI voices in their apps. Personal voice can be used to enable real-time speech translation scenarios with the speaker’s own voice speaking in another language.At the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro smartphones launch event last year, Google announced that it is bringing various enhancements to its Call Screen feature . Google showed off a demo in which the AI answered calls on the user’s behalf engaging in a more natural way.","Microsoft announced that its personal voice feature of Azure AI Speech is now generally available.

US to bring same rules for BNPL lenders as credit card companies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/us-to-bring-same-rules-for-bnpl-lenders-as-credit-card-companies/articleshow/110342266.cms,"The U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau will apply some credit card consumer protection rules to buy now, pay later (BNPL) lenders, the agency said on Wednesday, in a bid to impose more oversight on the fast-growing sector.BNPL providers such as Affirm, Klarna and Afterpay partner with retailers to finance customer purchases, which shoppers repay in installments.The sector has become a major source of credit, but lacks a federal oversight framework.Under an interpretive rule issued by the CFPB on Wednesday, BNPL lenders will be required to investigate customer disputes, refund products that have been returned, and provide periodic billing statements - all requirements that credit card companies currently comply with under the Truth in Lending Act.""Regardless of whether a shopper swipes a credit card or uses Buy Now, Pay Later, they are entitled to important consumer protections under longstanding laws and regulations already on the books,"" said CFPB Director Rohit Chopra in a statement.Most major BNPL providers already voluntarily comply with credit card-like protections, but the new rule should offer consistency across the sector, a CFPB official told reporters.The rule will only apply to the popular ""pay in four"" installment product, the official said. And BNPL providers will not be required to comply with some other credit card rules, such as assessing a consumer's ability to repay, the agency said.BNPL loans drove $75 billion in online spending in 2023, up 14.3% from 2022, according to Adobe Analytics.According to a 2022 CFPB report, consumers often use BNPL as a substitute for conventional credit cards but consumer protection disclosures vary across major providers, and the loans can lead consumers to become over-indebted.In a statement, a spokesperson for Klarna called the CFPB's move ""a significant step forward in regulating BNPL ,"" noting that it already operates at the standard called for in the rule.Under Chopra, the CFPB has cracked down on tech companies as they encroach on the traditional financial sector, proposing that it supervise payment services from Google and Apple and scrutinizing how tech giants use consumer payment data.The interpretive rule is open to comments until Aug. 1 and will be effective in 60 days, a CFPB official said.","U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau will apply credit card consumer protection rules to buy now, pay later (BNPL) lenders.

Amazon is gearing up to launch a smarter Alexa later this year, powered by artificial intelligence (AI). This revamped assistant will require a separate monthly subscription, CNBC has reported. The e-commerce giant is tight-lipped about the exact cost, but the new Alexa won't be bundled with the popular Prime membership. This information reportedly comes from sources familiar with Amazon's plans.Amazon said last September about developing an AI-powered Alexa to compete with advanced chatbots from Google (via Alphabet) and OpenAI .Their commitment was reiterated in a recent shareholder letter, outlining the integration of ""GenAI"" applications throughout their consumer offerings, including a more capable Alexa.Profitability has remained elusive for Alexa since its 2014 debut. Primarily, it has served as a tool to funnel users towards Amazon's online store.Meanwhile, the AI race is heating up. OpenAI recently unveiled GPT-4o, enabling real-time, lag-free conversations with their ChatGPT model. Additionally, ChatGPT can now interrupt conversations. Last week, Google showcased upgrades to its Gemini chatbot and search engine. Apple, too, is reportedly planning a significant AI overhaul for its Siri virtual assistant.According to CNBC, Amazon will leverage its own Titan large language model to power the upgraded Alexa. The company has shown a strong commitment to AI, exemplified by their $4 billion investment in Anthropic, whose chatbot ""Claude"" rivals ChatGPT.However, investors remain concerned. Microsoft 's early advantage in AI, fueled by their investment in OpenAI, could potentially steal market share from Amazon Web Services, the current leader in cloud computing.","Amazon reportedly plans to launch a smarter Alexa later this year.

How Does it Work

Consumers looking to buy smart devices this holiday season in the US may see a new label designed to help them choose products that are less vulnerable to hacking. The US Cyber Trust Mark Initiative , launched by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), allows manufacturers to display a special label on their products if they meet specific cybersecurity standards .In addition to the physical label, the program will also utilize QR codes. Consumers can scan these codes with their smartphones to access a national registry containing detailed security information about the specific device they're considering.These labels are said to be similar to the Energy Star program, which rates appliances ' energy efficiency, and say the idea is to empower consumers while also encouraging manufacturers to enhance their cybersecurity.This programme covers a wide range of internet-connected devices commonly found in homes, including:* Home security cameras* Fitness trackers* Refrigerators* Smart TVs* Other smart appliancesThe initiative was first announced by the White House in 2023, and the FCC finalised the details earlier this year. Manufacturers can now apply for the Cyber Trust Mark if their devices meet established cybersecurity criteria. These criteria are likely to address factors like:* Secure data storage practices* Ability for consumers to delete data* Detection of unusual device behavior and notification of users* Commitment to ongoing security updatesSeveral major industry players have already expressed support for the Cyber Trust Mark Initiative, including Amazon, Best Buy, Google, LG Electronics USA, Logitech and Samsung.This collaboration between the government and major tech companies suggests a commitment to raising cybersecurity standards within the smart home market.","US Cyber Trust Mark Initiative launched by Federal Communications Commission.

Just a week after OpenAI showcased a playful AI assistant with emotional intelligence, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella offered a contrasting view on human-computer interaction in an interview with Bloomberg Television on Monday.""I don't like anthropomorphizing AI,"" Nadella stated, referring to the practice of attributing human qualities to machines. ""I sort of believe it's a tool."" His comments highlight a growing debate within the tech industry.As AI capabilities soar, the question of how much to humanize these tools becomes increasingly relevant.Nadella even expressed his dislike for the term ""artificial intelligence"" itself, coined in the 1950s. ""I think one of the most unfortunate names is ‘artificial intelligence’ — I wish we had called it ‘different intelligence,'"" he said. ""Because I have my intelligence. I don’t need any artificial intelligence .""Last week, a Google executive spoke to Bloomberg about their focus on building ""super helpful and super useful"" AI, even though creating tools that ""show emotion"" is technically possible.OpenAI, however, has taken a distinctly different path. Their recent demo featured a voice assistant capable of understanding and expressing emotions. The presentation included moments where the AI seemed to playfully banter with the presenter, sparking comparisons to the movie ""Her"" on social media. The resemblance was further amplified by a voice option that some users felt mimicked Scarlett Johansson, the film's star.Johansson, in a statement to NPR, revealed that OpenAI CEO Sam Altman had approached her about voicing an audio chat feature. She claimed Altman presented it as an opportunity to ""help consumers feel comfortable with the seismic shift concerning humans and AI."" Johansson declined and stated she's had to involve lawyers due to OpenAI's choice to proceed with a similar-sounding voice. (OpenAI has since replaced the voice.)Tech companies have a long history of assigning human characteristics to AI programs, often with feminine names and traits, presumably to make users feel more at ease with the technology. Microsoft itself hasn't been exempt from this practice. Over the years, they've released various conversational AI programs like Tay and Cortana, named after the female AI assistant in the Halo video game franchise.Nadella acknowledges the natural tendency to describe AI in human terms. People seek ways to understand the complex algorithms behind the software, using relatable terms like ""learning"" to explain its function. This tendency is likely to strengthen as companies release more advanced AI capable of real-time conversation.However, Nadella emphasized the importance of user awareness. The capabilities displayed by AI software are not equivalent to human intelligence, he stressed. ""It has got intelligence, if you want to give it that moniker, but it's not the same intelligence that I have,"" he clarified.","Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella says he doesn't like anthropomorphizing AI.

This breakthrough paves the way for machines that can operate in some of the harshest places on Earth and beyond.Current memory devices, like solid-state drives (SSDs), can't handle extreme heat. They typically fail at around 572 degrees Fahrenheit (300 degrees Celsius).But this new memory, based on a special material called ferroelectric aluminum scandium nitride ( AlScN ), kept working even at a staggering 1,112 degrees Fahrenheit (600 degrees Celsius).This opens up exciting possibilities for using computers in places where they previously wouldn't last. Imagine sensors and other devices functioning flawlessly inside nuclear reactors, during deep-sea oil exploration, or even on the scorching surface of Venus The key to this new memory's resilience lies in its precise construction. The material is incredibly thin, measuring just 45 nanometers – that's 1,800 times smaller than a human hair! Finding the perfect thickness was crucial. Too thin, and the material wouldn't work properly. Too thick, and it wouldn't be efficient.Testing showed the memory could withstand a million read cycles while maintaining its functionality for over six hours – an impressive feat. This paves the way for a new generation of computers that can operate almost anywhere.""From drilling deep into the Earth to exploring space,"" say the researchers, ""these high-temperature memory devices could revolutionize computing where traditional electronics would fail."" This technology has the potential to push the boundaries of science and exploration.The future of computing might even involve entirely new chip designs. By combining this heat-resistant memory with powerful processors, scientists envision a new era of ""non-silicon"" computers. These machines could be ideal for data-intensive tasks like artificial intelligence (AI), especially in harsh environments where current silicon-based systems struggle.This research signifies a significant leap forward.

Apple may bring iPhone 16 series in two new colours: Details,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/mobiles-tabs/apple-may-bring-iphone-16-series-in-two-new-colours-details/articleshow/110260524.cms,"

Pro models may get a new Rose colour

Apple

may rename existing colours

Apple iPhone 16 series launch is months away. But the rumour mill is buzzing with expected features, design and now colour of the 2024 iPhone lineup. Popular Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo says that the Cupertino-based company may add two new colours to the iPhone 16, replacing the existing ones.The information was shared by Kuo in a post on X, formerly Twitter .In the post, Kuo says that the Pro models - iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max could be offered in black, white or silver, gray or ""Natural Titanium,"" and an all-new rose. The existing iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max are offered in Black Titanium, White Titanium, Blue Titanium and Natural Titanium colours.Kuo reveals that the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus are expected to come in black, green, pink, blue and white colour variants. Apple may also rename previous colours as well, Kuo adds. For example, the existing white could be renamed to starlight. “Also, even if the colour name is the same as the existing model, it may look different”, he says.Earlier, Kuo said that the iPhone 16 Pro Max is expected to feature a new battery with better energy density, potentially enhancing battery life if Apple maintains the same battery size. According to Kuo, iPhone 16 Pro Max will reportedly see a substantial redesign of its battery, switching from an aluminium to a stainless steel casing. This shift not only increases the battery's energy density but also improves its structural integrity. While stainless steel is less effective at dissipating heat compared to aluminium, it offers stronger protection, which could be beneficial for the overall durability of the device.In a related news, display analyst Ross Young said that the display production for Apple iPhone 16 will begin next month. This is on schedule with the timing of last year’s iPhone 15 production and the 2024 iPhone series launch may follow the same timeline as last year.","Apple may add two new colours to the iPhone 16, replacing the existing ones.

‘Godfather of AI’ Geoffrey Hinton: “Very worried about AI taking lots of…”,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/godfather-of-ai-geoffrey-hinton-very-worried-about-ai-taking-lots-of/articleshow/110254770.cms,"Hinton concerned of ‘extinction-level threats emerging’

Hinton is against the use of AI technology in the military



Geoffrey Hinton , the software engineer who is often regarded as the “godfather of artificial intelligence” has said that he is “very worried” about the artificial intelligence technology “taking lots of mundane jobs”. He said that it will be on to the governments to deal with the impact of artificial intelligence ( AI ) on income inequality.Hinton, who worked at Google until last year, said that while AI will increase productivity and wealth, the money would go to the rich “and not the people whose jobs get lost and that’s going to be very bad for society”.He noted that the government will have to establish a universal basic income , which means that the government will have to pay all individuals a set basic salary regardless of their means.“I was consulted by people in Downing Street and I advised them that universal basic income was a good idea,” Hinton, who left Google to talk more freely about the dangers of unregulated AI, told BBC.Hinton previously said that some of the dangers of AI chatbots were “quite scary”. He is of the view that AI chatbots can become more intelligent than humans and may be exploited by “bad actors”.AI could “evolve to get the motivation to make more of itself” and can autonomously “develop a sub-goal of getting control”, pointing out evidence of large language models choosing to be deceptive.""My guess is in between five and 20 years from now there’s a probability of half that we’ll have to confront the problem of AI trying to take over,” he said.As per Hinton, this will lead to an “extinction-level threat” for humans because they may have “created a form of intelligence that is just better than biological intelligence… That's very worrying for us”.“What I’m most concerned about is when these can autonomously make the decision to kill people,"" he added.","Geoffrey Hinton, the ‘godfather of artificial intelligence’ has said that he is ‘very worried’ about the artificial intelligence technology “taking lots of mundane jobs’ Hinton said that while AI will increase productivity and wealth, the money would go to the rich “and not the people whose jobs get lost”","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110254760,imgsize-126994,width-400,resizemode-4/110254760.jpg"

Phone condition: Assess the physical condition of the phone. Look for scratches, dents, or other signs of wear. Check the screen for cracks and ensure all buttons and ports function correctly.

Network compatibility: Confirm that the mobile phone is unlocked or compatible with your network carrier. Some phones are locked to specific carriers, limiting your options.

IMEI check: Verify the phone's IMEI number to ensure it's not stolen or blacklisted. This step helps prevent buying a phone with legal issues or unpaid bills.

Performance testing: Test the phone's performance by running apps, browsing the internet, and checking the camera quality. Look for lagging or freezing issues.

Storage capacity: Determine the phone's storage capacity and assess whether it meets your needs for storing photos, videos, and apps.

Price comparison: Research the market value of the phone model you're interested in. Compare prices from different sellers to ensure you're getting a fair deal.

In a bold move at the Cannes Film Festival, Polish director Patryk Vega unveiled his latest project, a biopic titled ""Putin,"" featuring an AI-generated deepfake of Russian President Vladimir Putin . The film, which has already been sold in 50 countries ahead of its September premiere, uses advanced artificial intelligence to replicate Putin's face on a real actor’s body.Vega, known for his popular Polish films, decided to use AI technology to create a more authentic portrayal of Putin.""To come extremely close to the dictator, we needed Putin, not an actor with make-up,"" Vega explained. The film’s trailer opens with a striking scene of the Russian leader cowering on the floor in diapers, setting the tone for its controversial narrative.As per an ET report, Vega humorously recounted his approach: ""I called Putin and asked him if he wanted to play in my movie... No, that was a joke."" Despite the jest, the director utilised AI to generate Putin's face due to the lack of sufficient high-resolution images for a full-body deepfake. The results, according to early viewers, are uncannily realistic.""Putin"" chronicles the life of the Russian president over six decades, starting from his childhood at age 10, where he is depicted being beaten by his stepfather. The film culminates in a fictional portrayal of his death, which Vega describes as ""a happy end.""The concept for the biopic emerged during the early days of Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Initially, Vega aimed to make a film about the Russian mafia but shifted focus to what he considered ""the biggest gangster.""Despite potential risks, Vega dismisses fears of reprisals, boldly stating, ""Putin should be afraid of me."" The director's venture into AI has broader implications for the film industry, particularly in Hollywood, where the technology is both a boon and a source of concern. AI advancements threaten traditional roles, especially among special effects technicians and extras, raising fears of job losses.These concerns were central to last year's strike by actors and writers, culminating in an agreement that included compensation for the use of AI-generated likenesses. Despite apprehensions, AI is already extensively used in the industry. For example, it was employed to de-age Harrison Ford in the latest ""Indiana Jones"" film, though studios often refrain from publicising these uses.Beyond film production, AI's applications are expanding in various sectors of the media. The Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media, for instance, uses algorithms to analyse screenplays for gender and diversity biases. YouTube, a significant player in film promotion and distribution, has leveraged AI for over a decade, employing it for automated subtitles and copyright protections.Since April, YouTube has begun labelling AI-generated content and enhancing its detection programs. Justine Ryst, head of YouTube France, emphasised that ""AI isn't going to take over creation. It's going to simplify the complex, and make possible the impossible."" She advocated for a balance between innovation and responsibility in utilising AI.","Polish director Patryk Vega unveiled his latest project, a biopic titled ""Putin,"" featuring an AI-generated deepfake of Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Watch: Sam Altman shares how he spent the 4-and-a-half days he was sacked as ChatGPT maker OpenAI CEO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/watch-sam-altman-shares-how-he-spent-the-four-and-a-half-days-he-was-sacked-as-chatgpt-maker-openai-ceo/articleshow/110203159.cms,"Sam Altman talks GPT-4o and Predicts the Future of AI

The big lesson learnt

Sam Altman , CEO of OpenAI , has been on a rollercoaster the last few years. Since the company's release of ChatGPT, he's widely regarded as the poster boy of Generative-AI world. He's met with world leaders, clashed with Elon Musk , and even joined the billionaire club. Amidst all this, he also got fired (briefly) from the company he co-founded.On a recent tech podcast ""The Logan Bartlett Show"", Altman said with a laugh that if he had more time to reflect, ""every day would have something crazy."" However, one truly surreal moment stands out: His four-day ousting from OpenAI.As reported by Business Insider, it wasn't the firing itself that was unreal. It was how he handled this bizarre situation. Altman described it as an ""insane, superjammed"" 4 ½ days where his body was in an ""adrenaline-charged state.""Within a day of being fired, world leaders started texting. He received messages from 10-20 presidents and prime ministers. He said it felt normal at the time, and he even thanked them without batting an eye.""It was just weird,"" Altman admitted. He barely slept or ate, but his focus and energy were off the charts.Once he got his job back, reality hit him. Stopping at a diner, he realized he hadn't eaten in days. Naturally, he celebrated with a feast: four ""heavy"" meals and two milkshakes (just for him!).The celebratory meal was great, but the real shocker came later. A president texted him, relieved things were settled.Suddenly, Altman realized how bizarre it all was. World leaders texting him during his firing shouldn't have felt normal, but it did. It showed him just how adaptable humans are.""We can get used to anything as the new normal, good or bad, pretty fast,"" Altman said. He sees this as a strength – humans can adapt to almost anything.""My takeaway is human adaptability to almost anything is just, like, much more remarkably strong than we realize,"" Altman said on the podcast. ""And you can get used to anything as the new normal, good or bad, pretty fast.""","Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, has been on a rollercoaster the last few years.
