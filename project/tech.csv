Google Maps has validated a reality that many residents of Bengaluru, also known as the Silicon Valley of India, have long suspected - sometimes, it’s quicker to walk than to drive through the city’s notorious traffic jams.Bengaluru’s transformation into India’s IT hub has attracted a massive influx of professionals, but the city’s infrastructure has struggled to keep pace.Rapid urbanization, poor urban planning, and limited public transportation options contribute to severe road congestion, especially during peak hours. Commuters often find themselves losing hours of productivity while stuck in traffic.A recent post by X user Ayush Singh highlights this issue with a Google Maps screenshot showing the travel time between Brigade Metropolis and KR Puram Railway Station, a distance of approximately 6 km. According to the screenshot, driving the distance takes about 44 minutes, while walking would take only 42 minutes.“This happens only in Bangalore,” Singh commented, sharing the screenshot.Singh’s post quickly went viral, garnering over 300,000 views in just one day. The responses were mixed, with many agreeing that Bengaluru’s traffic is indeed frustrating, while others pointed out that similar situations exist in other major cities.“Same story across many metro cities in the world,” one commenter noted.“Mumbai and Delhi also face the same issue during peak hours,” another user added.While some users humorously dubbed Bengaluru the “Traffic Capital of India,” others suggested practical solutions such as utilizing public transport to avoid the congested roads.Interestingly, a Bengaluru-based CEO recently proposed an innovative solution inspired by a practice in Beijing. Paras Chopra suggested a ‘rescue’ service where commuters stuck in traffic can call for assistance for a fee of $60. A motorbike rider would pick up the stranded commuter, while another individual would drive the commuter’s car to its destination.","Bengaluru, also known as the Silicon Valley of India, is home to India's IT hub.

Amazon is working to develop its own AI chips in a bid to reduce its reliance on Nvidia’s processors, a report said, noting that with this chip, the e-commerce giant aims to help customers compute complex calculations and process huge amounts of data in an affordable manner.Citing Amazon executive Rami Sinno, news agency Reuters reports that Amazon’s chip lab in Austin, Texas, has a server that is packed with Amazon's artificial intelligence chips that compete with those from market leader Nvidia.Amazon is working on creating its own AI chips to reduce its dependence on Nvidia’s ‘high-priced’ processors. These Nvidia chips are currently used to support the AI operations of Amazon Web Services, which is a major revenue source for the company.Sinno, the director of engineering for Amazon's Annapurna Labs that is a part of its cloud business AWS, told the news agency that Amazon's customers have been increasingly demanding more affordable alternatives to Nvidia’s chip.“So the offering of up to 40%, 50% in some cases of improved price (and) performance - so it should be half as expensive as running that same model with Nvidia,” said David Brown, Vice President, Compute and Networking at AWS.The report said that while the company's AI chip efforts are in a nascent stage, Amazon's Graviton – another chip that performs non-AI computing, has been under development for about a decade and is on its fourth generation.Reportedly, Amazon deployed a quarter million Graviton chips and 80,000 of its custom AI chips during its recent Prime Day event to handle the surge in activity across its platforms.Notably, Amazon is not the only tech giant company that is developing its own AI chips. Its cloud rivals Microsoft and Alphabet are also working on their own versions of AI chips.

What are Phi-3 models

Microsoft has announced several updates related to its own Phi-3 generative AI (GenAI) models as well as Azure cloud. The company says that developers can now quickly create customised AI solutions with its own small models and leverage the Azure cloud platform to access other AI models offered by companies like Meta – the parent organisation of Facebook and Instagram .“Developing and deploying AI applications at scale requires a robust and flexible platform that can handle the complex and diverse needs of modern enterprises and allow them to create solutions grounded in their organisational data,” Microsoft said on announcing updates.Microsoft said that it provides serverless fine-tuning for Phi-3-mini and Phi-3-medium models to enable developers to quickly and easily customise the models for cloud and edge scenarios without having to arrange for computation.The company also announced updates to the Phi-3-mini AI model including improvement in core quality, instruction-following, and structured output.

Why WhatsApp is less popular in the US



Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has announced that WhatsApp has reached a milestone of 100 million monthly active users in the US. The messaging app has seen rapid growth in major cities like Los Angeles, New York, Miami, and Seattle. Moreover, WhatsApp also reported “significant growth” in users in Southern US states, with Texas surpassing 10 million users.In a press release (seen by The Verge), WhatsApp spokesperson Ashley O’Reilly wrote: “This is the first time data pertaining to users has been released since Meta’s acquisition of the messaging app and demonstrates how the messaging platform, already the biggest messaging app in the world, has experienced tremendous growth in the US.”In 2014, social media giant Facebook (now Meta) purchased WhatsApp for $16 billion.Since then, the company has been putting efforts into making the app as popular in the US as it is outside the country.One such way was by advertising WhatsApp’s availability on iOS and Android , focusing particularly on how easy it is to message users across platforms. iPhones don’t need to switch from iMessage to SMS as WhatsApp messages from Androids don’t show up as green bubbles with lower-quality images, removed encryption, and shortened messages.Recently, WhatsApp also captured attention when it reunited the cast of Modern Family for an ad promoting this very feature to families.WhatsApp now boasts more than 2 billion users in over 180 countries, yet it’s still less popular in the US than rivals like Apple’s iMessage. While it may have experienced growth in the US, it’s going to be even harder for WhatsApp to compete once Apple replaces Rich Communication Services (RCS) as the communication protocol between Android and iOS devices.RCS support will be coming to iOS 18 this fall, after which iPhone users won’t need to switch to WhatsApp for group chats.","WhatsApp has reached a milestone of 100 million monthly active users in the US.

Karnataka reservation bill: PhonePe CEO and founder Sameer Nigam issues this 'personal statement',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/karnataka-reservation-bill-phonepe-ceo-and-founder-sameer-nigam-issues-this-personal-statement/articleshow/111908948.cms,"Read PhonePe CEO Sameer Nigam’s personal note

“PhonePe was born in Bengaluru and we are incredibly proud of our roots in this city, which is well known for its world-class technology talent and vibrant diversity. From Bengaluru, over the past decade we have expanded across the length and breadth of India and been able to deliver secure and efficient digital payments for over 55 Crore Indians.

Bengaluru's reputation as the ""Silicon valley of India"" is truly well-deserved. The city thrives on an incredible culture of innovation, and attracts the most brilliant young minds from Karnataka and the rest of India. As a company, we are deeply grateful for the supportive business environment that Karnataka’s governments and its local

Kannadiga

populace have offered us. Without such an inclusive ecosystem and progressive policies, Bengaluru would not have become a global technology superpower.

As a company we also thrive on celebrating diversity, we have always tried hard to deliver fair, unbiased and meritocracy-based employment opportunities for all Indians - including to all local Kannadigas. We believe such an approach gives every Indian a good job a chance to shine, and ultimately helps create more societal and economic value for Bengaluru, Karnataka and India.

I read some recent media articles, relating to a few personal comments that I made last week regarding the draft job reservation bill. I would first and foremost like to clarify that it was NEVER my intention to insult Karnataka and it’s people. If my comments hurt anyone’s sentiments in such a way, I am truly sorry and would like to offer you an unconditional apology. I have the highest regard for Kannada, and all other Indian languages. In fact, I truly believe that linguistic diversity and rich cultural heritage is a national asset that all Indians should be proud of; and all Indians should be respectful of and celebrate local and cultural norms.

Bengaluru’s Indian startups are competing against trillion dollar giants like Google, Apple, Amazon and Microsoft. To do so, these companies must be able to employ the very best talent available in India purely based on their technology skills and proficiency in fields such as Coding, Design, Product Management, Data Sciences, Machine Learning, AI and beyond. As a nation, that is the only way we can build world-class companies that can compete in the global village that we live in today.

I also want to help create lakhs of jobs for Bengaluru and Karnataka. And, I believe with more dialogue and discussion, we can find ways to create more sustainable employment avenues. Let’s all work together to do this meaningfully and while creating long-term impact.”

PhonePe CEO Sameer Nigam issued a personal note following backlash over his comments on Karnataka 's job reservation bill. The controversy erupted after Nigam criticised the bill on social media platform X, questioning whether his children deserved jobs in their home city given his company's pan-India job creation.""If my comments hurt anyone's sentiments, I am truly sorry and would like to offer you an unconditional apology,"" Nigam said in a statement.He emphasised his 22-year connection to Bengaluru and respect for linguistic diversity.The Karnataka Cabinet had recently approved a bill mandating 50% reservation for locals in management roles and 70% in non-management positions within private companies. The bill, which also proposed 100% quota for locals in certain government jobs, was put on hold after industry backlash.Nigam stressed the need for merit-based hiring to build globally competitive companies. He reaffirmed PhonePe's commitment to Karnataka, stating the company plans to create thousands of new jobs in the state.",PhonePe CEO Sameer Nigam issued a personal note following backlash over his comments on Karnataka's job reservation bill.
