How hackers may make it difficult for Taylor Swift fans to attend Eras Tour concerts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-hackers-may-make-it-difficult-for-taylor-swift-fans-to-attend-eras-tour-concerts/articleshow/111543988.cms,"What the hackers have threatened



What Ticketmaster has to say



""Ticketmaster's SafeTix technology protects tickets by automatically refreshing a new and unique barcode every few seconds so it cannot be stolen or copied. This is just one of many fraud protections we implement to keep tickets safe and secure.""

Hackers have reportedly leaked the ticket details of one of Taylor Swift 's concerts. According to a report by Bleeping Computers, event ticketing company Ticketmaster has claimed that it's facing a potential security breach .Cyberattackers associated with the group Sp1d3rHunters (formerly Sp1d3r) have reportedly claimed to have leaked barcode data for 166,000 tickets to Taylor Swift's Eras Tour .The report claims that the barcode data is for upcoming Taylor Swift concerts in Miami, New Orleans and Indianapolis. The ongoing tour started last year and will continue till December 2024.Ticketmaster has not yet commented on the situation, and the authenticity of the leaked data remains unverified. If it turns out to be true, it may leave a significant number of fans unable to attend the concerts.The hackers have allegedly demanded a ransom of $2 million from the company to prevent them from leaking data for other events.This extortion demand , which was first shared by threat intel service HackManac, reads:""Pay us $2 million or we leak all 680 million of your user's information and 30 million more event barcodes including more Taylor Swift events, P!nk, Sting, Sporting events F1 Formula Racing, MLB, NFL and thousands more events.”Sp1d3rHunters is known for extorting companies after stealing data from Snowflake accounts.The hackers have also claimed that the leaked data isn't just ticket barcodes but also includes information to create scannable barcodes (like stripes and numbers) along with details like seat location and ticket price.The group even provided instructions on turning this data into functioning barcodes. This leak seems connected to a larger Ticketmaster data breach in May, as some details like hashed credit card info match the previous leak.In a statement to Bleeping Computer, Ticketmaster said that unique barcodes are updated every few seconds, so the stolen tickets cannot be used.The company said:","Hackers have reportedly leaked the ticket details of one of Taylor Swift's concerts.

Microsoft Security Team, earlier this year, announced that it detected a nation-state cyber attack by Russian hackers , who were able to access the company’s corporate email systems.

The spokesperson, however, noted that no security or sensitive personally identifiable data was compromised and that the agency is working closely with the Department of Homeland Security.The Department of Veterans Affairs also said in March, it was notified that it was affected by the Microsoft breach.Microsoft disclosed the breach in January, attributing it to Midnight Blizzard. The company said that the Russian hacking group accessed corporate email accounts and warned of potential attempts to exploit shared secrets between them and customers.According to the report, hackers used a single set of credentials stolen from the emails they accessed to break into a test environment on the VA’s Microsoft Cloud account around January. The authorities also said that the intrusion lasted one second apparently because Midnight Blizzard intended to verify that the credentials were valid.The agency changed the exposed credentials, along with login details to its Microsoft environments, as soon as it was notified of the intrusion.“As our investigation continues, we have reached out to customers to notify them if they have corresponded with a Microsoft corporate email account that has been accessed,” a Microsoft spokesperson said.","US Department of Veterans Affairs and an arm of the US State Department are among a growing list of Microsoft customers who said that they were impacted by the hacking.

Apple MacBook Pro models with M4 chipsets: What to expect



Apple is expected to launch new MacBook Pro and MacBook Air models in the coming months. According to a report by Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, the rumoured MacBook Pro and MacBook Air machines are likely to come powered by three variants of Apple’s M4 chipsets -- the base M4, M4 Pro and M4 Max chipsets. The report also notes that the upgraded MacBooks may retain their predecessor's designs and may even offer new features through an AI subscription service which is expected to boost sales.Rumours suggest that Apple will soon release 14-inch and 16-inch models of MacBook Pros with M4 chips by the end of this year or early next year. Moreover, MacBook Air sizes are also in line for an early 2025 refresh.Currently, the only Apple devices with the M4 chip are the newest iPad Pro models . The most affordable option is the 11-inch iPad Pro with 256GB of storage which was launched at Rs 99,900.Gurman claims that both the MacBook Pro and MacBook Air won't see any design changes despite getting upgraded to the M4 chipsets. This comes after the 2021 redesign of the MacBook Pro with the M1 chip.He also suggested that a more significant visual overhaul might be coming in 2026, potentially coinciding with the adoption of OLED displays similar to the latest iPad Pro models.Similarly, the MacBook Air is also expected to wait until 2027 for a design refresh, five years after it departs from the wedge shape.Gurman acknowledges that a chip upgrade alone might not be enough to entice existing MacBook users to upgrade.To address this, Apple is reportedly considering a monthly subscription service that builds upon the free Apple Intelligence launching this fall.Additionally, Gurman claims Apple might integrate and potentially take a commission on third-party AI services like ChatGPT, mirroring their App Store model.",Apple is expected to launch new MacBook Pro and MacBook Air models in the coming months.

Enable alerts: Set up transaction alerts through your bank or credit card issuer to receive notifications of any transactions made with your card.

Use strong and unique passwords: Secure your online banking and shopping accounts with strong passwords that include a combination of letters, numbers, and special characters. Avoid using information that is easily guessed, such as birth dates and names.

Keep your devices secure: Install antivirus software, keep your operating system and apps updated, and avoid connecting to unsecured public Wi-Fi networks when making online transactions.

Shred personal documents: Shred any documents containing sensitive information such as credit card statements or receipts before disposing of them.

Report lost or stolen cards immediately: Contact your bank or credit card issuer immediately if your card is lost or stolen to prevent unauthorised use.

Credit card fraud involves cybercriminals obtaining sensitive credit card information such as the card number, PIN, CVV, and other necessary details to make unauthorised purchases or transfers.While credit card fraud detection systems can aid in identifying fraudulent transactions to some extent, fraudsters often manage to inflict substantial financial harm on victims before being apprehended.Therefore, it's crucial to familiarise oneself with various types of credit card fraud and take proactive measures to avoid becoming a victim. Being vigilant and informed can significantly reduce the risk of falling prey to such fraudulent activities.Despite the low or zero liabilities for credit card users, fraud or identity theft can still cause significant inconvenience for both customers and banks. While the bank's zero-liability policy protects credit card users from financial losses if they report the fraud within 60 days, they must endure the process of detecting the theft, notifying the bank, obtaining a replacement card, paying any associated fees, and updating all automatic payment accounts.The rise of awareness among credit card users is essential for early detection and prevention of fraud, helping banks address potential issues proactively.",The rise of awareness among credit card users is essential for early detection and prevention of fraud.

Apple iPhone 16 series rumours

Apple iPhone 16 series is expected to launch in September and in the run up to the debut, the rumour mill is already churning out scores of leaks. According to another such leak, iPhone 16 Pro Max is expected to get a boost in battery life .Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has said that the Cupertino-based giant is increasing the energy density of the battery cells of iPhone 16 Pro Max, which will result in longer battery life.“My latest supply chain survey indicates the energy density (Wh/kg) of the battery cells of iPhone 16 Pro Max will increase, which has the benefit of longer battery life with the same battery size or lower battery size with the same battery life,” he said in a post.However, with increase in energy density of the battery cells, there will be an increase in temperature when running. To tackle this, Apple will use the stainless steel battery case .“Increasing the energy density of the battery cells will increase the battery temperature when running. To avoid overheating the battery, Apple uses the stainless steel battery case for the first time as a thermal solution ,” Kuo said.While stainless steel may not be as effective as aluminium in dissipating heat, “it is more robust and less susceptible to corrosion, so in addition to dissipating heat, the stainless steel battery case provides better protection for the battery and the iPhone system.”Kuo noted that the use of a stainless steel battery case will reduce the difficulty of removing the battery, hence, helping Apple to “comply with the European Union’s requirements for mobile phone batteries’ replaceability in the future.”“If the mass production of this new battery design (upgraded energy density of battery cells & adoption of the stainless steel battery case) goes well and the feedback is favourable, this new battery design will be adopted in all 2H25 new iPhone models,” Kuo noted.The iPhone 16 series is rumoured to replace physical buttons with touch-sensitive buttons that simulate a press with haptic feedback. The camera layout might shift to a vertical design, unlike the current diagonal setup. The customisable Action button, currently on Pro models, might be available on all iPhone 16 models.Under the hood, the standard iPhone 16 and Plus models might use the A18 chip , while Pro models could get the A18 Pro chip. Meanwhile, the display size for iPhone 16 and Plus (6.1-inch and 6.7-inch) might remain the same, but the refresh rate could improve.","iPhone 16 Pro Max is expected to get a boost in battery life.
