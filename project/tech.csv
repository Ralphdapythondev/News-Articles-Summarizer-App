"Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella daily personally calls two CEOs daily, and asks these two questions",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-daily-personally-calls-two-ceos-daily-and-asks-these-two-questions/articleshow/114412316.cms,"From phone calls to billion-dollar deals: How Nadella’s daily habit has been fruitful to Microsoft

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has adopted an unconventional daily habit. The CEO of the $3 trillion tech giant carves out time each day to personally connect with two different executives, ranging from AI innovators to sports coaches, according to a recent report by The Information. This practice, deeply woven into Nadella's routine, serves as his radar for detecting emerging trends, potential partnerships, and fresh talent in the rapidly evolving tech landscape.Nadella's calls span a wide range of industries, from AI leaders like Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas to figures outside the tech world, such as former Seattle Seahawks head coach Pete Carroll.During these conversations, Nadella reportedly focuses on two key questions:""What new startups are you excited about?""""What new people have you met that would be good to know?""These daily check-ins have proven fruitful for Microsoft, laying the groundwork for crucial partnerships and investments. The Information reports that Nadella's frequent communication with Mustafa Suleyman , co-founder of DeepMind and Inflection AI, eventually led to Suleyman's hiring as the head of Microsoft AI.Nadella's networking approach aligns with Microsoft's recent investment strategy. Under his leadership, the company has made significant moves in the AI and robotics sectors:• A $10 billion investment in OpenAI in 2023• Participation in a $675 million funding round for humanoid robotics startup Figure AI• A $1.5 billion investment in UAE-based G42""You have to be open-minded that at the end of the day, sometimes partnerships are the only way to get ahead,"" Nadella said of the OpenAI partnership in a May interview with the Stratechery newsletter.Nadella's networking strategy reflects a broader shift in his leadership approach at Microsoft. Since taking the helm in 2014, he has steered the company towards a more collaborative and partnership-oriented model. This approach has been instrumental in Microsoft's resurgence as a tech leader, particularly in emerging fields like AI and cloud computing.","Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has adopted an unconventional daily habit.

"LTIMindtree win its largest deal in history: We are now ..., says COO",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ltimindtree-win-its-largest-deal-in-history-we-are-now-says-coo/articleshow/114404534.cms,"The strategic shift in approach

Positive but remains cautious

LTIMindtree, India's sixth-largest technology services company, is reportedly focusing on larger clients and leveraging artificial intelligence ( AI ) to secure significant market share. A company executive told Economic Times that LTIMindtree recently won its largest deal ever, a result of its AI-centric approach.Nachiket Deshpande, the company's chief operating officer, stated that AI is being integrated into all services.This strategic shift has led to a surge in large deals, including the record-breaking manufacturing contract . “We are now embedding AI into each of our service, reimagining with AI… Bulk of our large deals that we announced this quarter came because of that differentiated AI offering. This is one of our largest deals in the history of the company, that we signed with a manufacturing client,” said Deshpande in an interaction with ET.In the second quarter of fiscal year 2025, LTIMindtree secured several multi-year projects, including a $200 million deal from a U.S.-based manufacturer. Despite a slight decline in quarterly revenue , the company's large deal pipeline remains robust at over $5 billion.Deshpande explained that the AI-focused approach has enabled LTIMindtree to consolidate multiple vendors into a single provider. Additionally, the company is carefully evaluating smaller clients and may reduce its involvement if strategic improvements are not achieved.While cost reduction remains a significant driver of growth, Deshpande emphasized the company's focus on winning larger market share with existing clients.LTIMindtree, formed in 2022 from the merger of L&T Infotech and Mindtree, reported a 3.2% quarter-over-quarter revenue growth in the second quarter. Despite this positive trend, the company remains cautious about the outlook due to seasonal factors and potential macroeconomic challenges.The company's margin target of 17-18% may be delayed due to factors such as wage hikes and geopolitical tensions. Deshpande acknowledged these challenges but expressed confidence in the company's long-term growth prospects.","LTIMindtree is reportedly focusing on larger clients and leveraging artificial intelligence ( AI ) to secure significant market share.

During a dig in 1936, paleontologist Llewellyn Ivor Prince found a theropod (a carnivorous, bipedal dinosaur) specimen at the Santa Maria Formation in southern Brazil. Thanks to radiocarbon dating of sediments surrounding the fossil, during the late Triassic period, about 225 million years ago. Also called the “Southern Cross Lizard,” the dinosaur was named after the Southern Hemisphere constellation.

From the findings we have, the Staurikosaurus was large for an early dinosaur — it was around 2 meters long, 80 cm tall, and weighed 30 kg, which is close to the weight of a large dog. Staurikosaurus had a long tail and ran on two legs, and its fossils suggest that it was quite fast for its size. The predator also had serrated teeth that were curved towards the back of its throat, which helped with catching and holding prey.","The Staurikosaurus was a carnivorous, bipedal dinosaur.

Other AI tools that Meta is releasing

Meta , the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, recently announced that it is releasing new AI models, including a “Self-Taught Evaluator”, from its research division. Among other things, this AI model uses AI to evaluate other AI models, potentially reducing the need for human involvement in the development process.Meta's Self-Taught Evaluator is nothing but a “chain of thought” reasoning technique, which is used by OpenAI's latest model OpenAI o1 that is claimed to offer reasoning while responding.As per a report by news agency Reuters, this approach breaks down complex tasks into smaller, more manageable steps, improving accuracy in areas like mathematics, scientific analysis, and coding.What sets Meta's model apart is that it's trained entirely on AI-generated data, eliminating the reliance on human-labeled data.Notably, this approach of AI model may pave the way for more autonomous AI systems capable of self-improvement. By learning from its own mistakes, AI could become increasingly accurate and sophisticated without constant human intervention.“We hope, as AI becomes more and more super-human, that it will get better and better at checking its work, so that it will actually be better than the average human,” said Jason Weston, one of the researchers.This may also streamline the development process and potentially lead to more powerful and efficient AI applications.“The idea of being self-taught and able to self-evaluate is basically crucial to the idea of getting to this sort of super-human level of AI,” he added.In addition to the Self-Taught Evaluator, Meta also released other AI tools, including an update to its Segment Anything image identification model, a tool to accelerate response times in large language models, and datasets to aid in the discovery of new inorganic materials.","Meta's Self-Taught Evaluator is nothing but a “chain of thought” reasoning technique.

Jio and Airtel wanted spectrum auction

Telecom Minister clarifies

Starlink CEO and X (previously Twitter) owner Elon Musk posted that Starlink ‘will do our best to serve the people of India’. Musk was responding to the announcement made by union telecom minister Jyotiradtiya Scindia that satcomm spectrum will be allocated administratively and not auctioned. “BREAKING: India’s government said it will allot spectrum for satellite broadband administratively and not via auction, hours after Elon Musk criticized the auction route being sought by billionaire Mukesh Ambani Good News for Starlink,” X user DogeDesinger wrote in a post.Replying to the post, Musk wrote “Much appreciated! We will do our best to serve the people of India with Starlink.”Earlier this week, both Jio and Airtel called for a revised approach to spectrum allocation for satellite communication companies in India. In a letter to the telecom minister, Jio emphasised that satellite companies should acquire spectrum through a transparent auction process, similar to traditional telecom players. Speaking at IMC 2024, Bharti Airtel Chairman Sunil Mittal favoured bidding for such allocation.Musk then termed their demand as ‘unprecedented’.Telecom Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia said on Tuesday that such airwaves will be given out through administrative allocation and not auctioned. ""Satellite spectrum across the world is allocated administratively. So, India is not doing anything different from the rest of the world. Conversely, if you do decide to auction it then you would be doing something, which is different from the rest of the world,"" the minister said.""That does not mean that spectrum does not come without a cost. What that cost is and what the formula of that cost is going to be, will not be decided by you or me ...it will be decided by Trai...and there is a paper that has already been circulated by Trai, and we have a regulatory authority for telecom, and that regulatory authority of telecom has been empowered by the constitution to decide what that administrative pricing is going to be,"" he said.","Telecom Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia said on Tuesday that such airwaves will be given out through administrative allocation and not auctioned.

According to a report by Irish radio station Newstalk, the country’s police have claimed that these devices, including AirPods and iPhone accessories, worth an estimated $173,904 (more than 1.4 crores) were reportedly seized in County Mayo. The raids which targeted businesses in several Irish towns, including Castlebar, Westport, Ballinrobe, and Claremorris were conducted earlier this week.This multi-agency operation involved the local police crime unit, the Garda National Immigration Bureau and other agencies.The investigation is ongoing, and no arrests have been made yet, the report added.Counterfeiting reportedly remains a significant problem, costing the EU economy an estimated €85 billion ($92.4 billion) annually. This recent seizure follows a similar operation in Northern Ireland in May 2024, where counterfeit goods worth $750,000 were confiscated.In July, the Central Crime Branch (CCB) in Bengaluru raided two shops selling counterfeit Apple products and substandard cables from various brands. Fake AirPods Pro, USB-C to Lightning cables, and cables falsely labelled with brands like AV Guard and Poly Cab were seized, totalling over Rs 14 lakh in value. The investigation was later handed over to local police.Earlier this year, five individuals from China were charged with defrauding Apple out of over $12 million by swapping counterfeit iPhones for genuine ones atApple Stores in California.

Cybercriminals are increasingly leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to create sophisticated malware, according to Check Point Software Technologies' Global Threat Index for September 2024. The report reveals a growing trend of AI-assisted malware development , with AsyncRAT ranking 10th among the most prevalent malware.Researchers discovered that threat actors likely used AI to develop a script delivering AsyncRAT malware through HTML smuggling.This method involves sending a password-protected ZIP file containing malicious VBScript code to initiate an infection chain on the victim's device. The well-structured and commented code suggested AI involvement in its creation.Maya Horowitz, VP of Research at Check Point Software, emphasised the significance of this development, stating, ""The fact that threat actors have started utilising generative AI as part of their attack infrastructure highlights the continuous evolution of cyber-attack tactics.""The report also identified FakeUpdates as the most prevalent malware in September, impacting 7% of organisations worldwide. Androxgh0st and Formbook followed, affecting 6% and 4% of global organisations, respectively.In the mobile sphere, Joker remained the top threat, while RansomHub continued to lead among ransomware groups. The education and research sector was the most targeted industry globally, followed by government/military and healthcare.The emergence of AI-driven malware development is particularly concerning as it potentially lowers the barrier for cybercriminals with limited technical skills to create sophisticated threats. This trend underscores the need for organisations to implement proactive security strategies and comprehensive training for their teams.","Check Point Software Technologies' Global Threat Index for September 2024 reveals growing trend of AI-assisted malware development.

US Army makes a 'price request' to Microsoft for these Goggles,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/us-army-makes-a-price-request-to-microsoft-for-these-goggles/articleshow/114387663.cms,"What are Microsoft Goggles IVAS

$21.9 billion order in waiting for Microsoft

Microsoft's futuristic goggles designed for the US Army are reportedly facing a price challenge. According to a report in Bloomberg, ""The cost of Microsoft Corp.’s goggles for the US Army should “be substantially less than” than the projected $80,000 per set if they’re to generate large orders in the future, the service said.""Microsoft Goggles -- known as the Integrated Visual Augmentation System ( IVAS ) -- are based on Microsoft’s HoloLens “mixed reality” goggles.The Army has reportedly indicated that the current projected cost of $80,000 per set of Microsoft Goggles is too high to justify large-scale orders in the future.IVAS, which is based on Microsoft's HoloLens mixed reality technology, is intended to provide soldiers with a range of capabilities, including night vision, threat detection, and real-time information. The Army has been impressed with the device's performance, particularly compared to an earlier version that caused discomfort.However, the high price tag could affect the US Army's plans to purchase up to 121,000 units over a decade. The service has acknowledged that affordability is a key factor in determining whether to proceed with full production.The Army reportedly has planned to order as many as 121,000 of the devices contingent on results of an increasingly rigorous series of combat tests. The Army's decision on whether to move forward with full production will depend on the final cost and the results of ongoing testing, which includes a major combat exercise next year. If the Army commits to the project, Microsoft could potentially receive a contract worth billions of dollars. The report suggests that Microsoft could receive as much as $21.9 billion over a decade for the devices, spares and support services if all options are exercised.Testing to date “is going much better than the first time around” as “a lot of the problems have been fixed,” Army acquisition chief Doug Bush said this week at the annual Association of the US Army conference. “However — and this is important — we still have to be able get something that’s affordable” in order for the service to embrace full production rates.Microsoft on 'price cut' for the GogglesTo address the cost issue, Microsoft is exploring ways to reduce expenses in various areas, such as components, labor, and supply chain management. The company hopes to bring the unit cost down substantially from the current estimate.“We are going through the program to identify where we can reduce costs,” Robin Seiler, Microsoft’s corporate vice president for Mixed Reality, told reporters this week, as per the Bloomberg report.“It’s a fairly complex system, so when you look at cost reduction you have to look at it from a component level, from a labor level and from your supply chain,” Seiler said. Some of the cost projections are related to initial production batches and other projections are based “over time,” she reportedly said.","Microsoft's futuristic goggles designed for the US Army are reportedly facing a price challenge.

“As a result of DoD's unlawful and misguided decision to place and maintain. DJI on the CMC List, DJI has suffered significant and ongoing financial and reputational harm. Because of the CMC designation, which marks DJI as a national security threat, US and international customers have terminated existing contracts with DJI and refuse to enter into new ones. DJI and its employees now suffer frequent and pervasive stigmatisation. US employees of DJI have been repeatedly harassed and insulted in public places.”

DJI faces mounting pressure in the US



DJI has sued the US Defense Department (DoD) for listing it as a company allegedly linked to the Chinese military . The world’s largest drone maker has claimed that the designation is inaccurate and has caused substantial financial damages to the company. The lawsuit, filed in a US District Court in Washington, seeks the removal of DJI from the Pentagon's list of ""Chinese military companies” (CMC).DJI noted that it is ""neither owned nor controlled by the Chinese military"" and that the designation has resulted in lost business deals and reputational damage.Being on the list serves as a warning to US firms about potential national security risks associated with doing business with these companies. DJI alleges that the designation has led to contract terminations and a reluctance from customers to engage with the company.DJI, which sells over half of all commercial drones in the US, argues that the DoD's decision is ""unlawful and misguided"" and has significantly impacted its operations and financial standing.In the filing (seen by The Verge), DJI alleges:DJI is facing a lot of challenges in the US market. Earlier this week, the country’s Customs and Border Protection (CBP) started blocking imports of some of its drones, citing concerns about potential forced labour violations under the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act.DJI has already faced scrutiny from US lawmakers over data security and national security risks associated with its drones.

Despite a seemingly strong partnership, OpenAI and Microsoft are reportedly engaged in intense negotiations to determine how Microsoft's substantial investment of nearly $13 billion will translate into equity as OpenAI transitions to a for-profit entity. This is said to have stemmed from one incident last year.According to a report by the New York Times, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella wanted to continue the investment but OpenAI CEO Sam Altman ’s sacking reportedly shook Microsoft's commitment to investing in the ChatGPT maker.“Nadella was initially willing to keep the cash spigot flowing. But after OpenAI’s board of directors briefly ousted Mr. Altman last November, Nadella and Microsoft reconsidered,” the report said, citing four people familiar with the talks.“Over the next few months, Microsoft wouldn’t budge as OpenAI, which expects to lose $5 billion this year, continued to ask for more money and more computing power to build and run its AI systems,” the report noted.OpenAI and Microsoft are in the midst of complex negotiations to finalise their partnership structure, with potential implications for the future of AI. The discussions centre around Microsoft's investment and its corresponding equity stake in OpenAI as the AI startup transitions to a for-profit model.However, the negotiations have hit a snag.

Intel is exploring stake sale in Altera, its programmable chip subsidiary . The chipmaker is aiming to sell a minority stake in Altera, sources familiar with the matter told CNBC. Quoting people with knowledge of the matter, the report said that Intel is seeking a deal that values Altera at around $17 billion.Intel has reportedly approached potential investors, including private equity firms, about acquiring a significant portion of the business, with the possibility of selling at least a minority stake.This move represents a dramatic shift for Intel, which acquired Altera for $16.7 billion in 2015. It comes as the company faces significant financial pressures , with its stock price down 50% this year amid fierce competition from rivals like Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices .The potential sale would mark a departure from Intel's previous stance on Altera. As recently as last month, CEO Pat Gelsinger had described the business as core to Intel's future. The company had earlier suggested it might monetize Altera through an IPO by 2026, but the current sale process indicates a more urgent need for capital.Intel's decision is part of a broader restructuring effort, which includes spinning off its foundry business as an independent subsidiary. The company reported a $1.6 billion loss in the first quarter of 2024 and announced 15,000 job cuts in August, underscoring its financial challenges.Despite these difficulties, Intel has secured a significant win for its newly independent foundry business, announcing a multibillion-dollar agreement withAmazon Web Services to produce an ""artificial intelligence fabric chip"" using its advanced 18A manufacturing process.The restructuring also involves pausing construction of new chip plants in Europe and reducing Intel's global real estate footprint. Bloomberg reports that CEO Gelsinger described these changes as ""the most significant transformation of Intel in over four decades.""Intel's strategic shifts have attracted attention from industry rivals. Arm reportedly approached Intel about acquiring its product division but was rebuffed, while Qualcomm has expressed interest in a potential takeover of Intel.","Intel is exploring stake sale in Altera, its programmable chip subsidiary.

This is a positive sign for Apple, after facing challenges in the crucial Chinese market last year.Though the smartphone market is stagnant, the iPhone remains Apple's most crucial product, generating roughly half of its sales.Strong iPhone sales in China are a positive indicator for Apple's overall performance.The iPhone 16's success can be attributed to several factors. A smooth production ramp-up, consistent pricing strategy, and existing user upgrades all contributed to ""substantial growth"" in China, said Counterpoint analyst Ivan Lam.Consumers are also gravitating towards pricier options, with sales of the top-tier Pro and Pro Max models jumping 44% compared to their predecessors.Despite the promising start, competition remains fierce. Local rivals like Vivo's X200 Pro, Huawei's upcoming Mate device, and updates from Xiaomi and Oppo threaten to steal market share. Additionally, the ongoing economic slowdown in China might lead some consumers to delay purchases until major shopping holidays like Singles' Day in November.While the iPhone 16 boasts AI features, the lack of a local partner for these features in China poses a potential hurdle. Analysts previously expressed concerns about this, as Beijing restricts foreign-developed AI models. Apple may need to collaborate with a Chinese company like Baidu to fully utilize these features in the region.While the initial response is positive, it remains to be seen how the iPhone 16 will fare throughout its lifespan. The success will depend on navigating intense competition and the ongoing economic climate in China.","Apple's latest iPhone series, iPhone 16, has good news for Apple in China.
