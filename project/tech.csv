Why FIFA’s search of ‘new deal’ for Club World Cup may be ‘bad news’ for Apple,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-fifas-search-of-new-deal-for-club-world-cup-may-be-bad-news-for-apple/articleshow/111791228.cms,"Apple’s connection with Club World Cup streaming and problems for FIFA

Apple ’s reported billion dollar deal with FIFA to secure worldwide streaming rights for the Club World Cup tournament next year may have been scrapped. According to a report by New York Times-owned The Athletic, FIFA is searching for broadcasters for streaming the revamped FIFA Club World Cup in the Americas, Asia and the Middle East & North Africa regions.This means that the reported deal, which would have given Apple TV+ exclusive access to broadcast the month-long event featuring some of the biggest club teams from across the globe, is effectively ending. The expanded men’s Club World Cup is set to take place in the US from June 15 to July 13, 2025 and then in 2029.Through a newly-launched tender, FIFA is aiming to find multiple broadcasters to secure commitments for specific regions. The governing body said that this tender process will allow them “to select the entity, or entities, that are best placed to secure the required transmission and programming commitments on a global, regional, or territory-specific basis”. The deadline for submitting bids is August 20.In April, reports suggested Apple was close to securing a $1 billion global streaming deal for the Club World Cup, with an announcement anticipated soon. However, earlier this month, it was claimed that the deal had either collapsed or was more “proposed” than “deal” in the first place.It was previously claimed that the $1 billion amount is far less than the $4 billion FIFA had initially sought. This is because there weren’t many takers of the deal at that price, with a person familiar with the broadcast industry reportedly saying that a major US media company estimated the value of competition’s streaming rights in North America at around $30 million.Moreover, people familiar with the process told the publication that FIFA faced difficulties in enticing traditional broadcasters to invest heavily in the Club World Cup. Major names like NBC, the broadcaster of the English Premier League, and Fox Sports, which holds the FIFA World Cup rights, reportedly opted out of bidding.Secondly, with a deal providing global streaming rights via Apple TV+ would have aligned with Apple’s strategy of offering exclusive content to drive subscriptions for Apple TV+. However, this drew criticism from Ricardo Fort, a former head of global sponsorships at Visa, a FIFA partner. He argued that a global sporting event behind a subscription service may well serve fans in wealthier countries but it would be a barrier for many others.“For a global event, a great new tournament where they should be thinking about how to build interest and awareness around the world, a subscription-based product is not ideal, assuming the only access is by paying Apple,"" Fort said. Notably, the company secured a $2.5 billion deal over a decade for exclusive global access to MLS in 2022.A single broadcaster approach stands in stark contrast to the traditional model favoured by major sporting events. Typically, broadcast rights are fragmented and sold across various markets to maximise reach and revenue. For instance, the Premier League has sold rights to 40 companies in 97 countries for the current cycle (2022-2025).","FIFA is searching for broadcasters for streaming the revamped FIFA Club World Cup in the Americas, Asia and the Middle East & North Africa regions.

Microsoft cuts jobs in DEI team; laid-off leader criticises move in an email sent to thousands of employees,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-cuts-jobs-in-dei-team-laid-off-leader-criticises-move-in-an-email-sent-to-thousands-of-employees/articleshow/111796866.cms,"Microsoft has eliminated an internal team focused on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), citing ""changing business needs,"" according to a recent report by Business Insider.The layoffs , which took effect on July 1, have sparked controversy within the company.The move comes despite Microsoft's previous commitments to improve diversity efforts, including a pledge made in 2020 to double the number of Black and African-American leaders within the company by 2025.The current progress on this initiative remains unclear.However, a leader of the disbanded team has expressed strong criticism of the decision in an email sent to thousands of Microsoft employees, as he suggests that the team is no longer critical for the company. ""True systems-change work associated with DEI programs everywhere are no longer business critical or smart as they were in 2020,"" the team leader wrote, as reported by Business Insider.Microsoft spokesperson Jeff Jones stated that the company's diversity and inclusion commitments remain unchanged. ""Our focus on diversity and inclusion is unwavering and we are holding firm on our expectations, prioritising accountability, and continuing to focus on this work,"" Jones said in a statement to Business Insider.This reduction in DEI staff aligns with a broader trend in the tech industry. Companies like Zoom , Google , and Meta have also reportedly cut back on their diversity programs in recent months.The layoffs are part of Microsoft's annual workforce adjustments, which typically occur around the start of its fiscal year. However, the company has been conducting more frequent rounds of job cuts recently, including a significant reduction of 10,000 employees announced in early 2023.","Microsoft has eliminated an internal team focused on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) The layoffs took effect on July 1, and have sparked controversy within the company.

How this technology may have helped FBI access locked phone of Trump's shooter in two days,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-this-technology-may-have-helped-fbi-access-locked-phone-of-trumps-shooter-in-two-days/articleshow/111790317.cms,"What software helped FBI access the shooter’s phone

Previous phone-cracking incident

Two days after the assassination attempt on former US President Donald Trump , the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) announced that they had “gained access” to the shooter's phone. The agency did not reveal how they managed to break into the device or what information they discovered. However, the rapid success suggests the use of advanced phone-hacking tools .“FBI technical specialists successfully gained access to Thomas Matthew Crooks’ phone, and they continue to analyse his electronic devices,” the FBI said, without mentioning the name and model of the phone. The agency, however, failed in its first attempt to break into the shooter’s phone.According to a report by The Verge, when field agents in Pennsylvania failed to ‘crack’ the phone, the FBI sent it to its lab in Quantico, Virginia where they took the help of security researchers to break into the phone.The publication cited Cooper Quintin, a security researcher and senior staff technologist with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, saying that the law enforcement agencies possess tools to extract data from phones.“Almost every police department in the nation has a device called the Cellebrite , which is a device built for extracting data from phones, and it also has some capability to unlock phones,” Quintin was quoted as saying.Cellebrite, an Israel-based company, provides mobile device extraction tools (MDTFs) to law enforcement. The report noted that these tools come from various vendors and offer different capabilities for extracting data from mobile devices. Their efficacy – how well they work – can vary significantly. It's likely the FBI has its own internal forensics tools developed specifically for their needs.“It seems reasonable to me that the field office there [in Pennsylvania] wouldn’t have some of the more advanced techniques for breaking into modern phones that they have at Quantico,” Quintin said, adding that he had “little doubt that Quantico will be able to break into this phone”.In a previous case, the FBI had demanded that Apple unlock an iPhone of the shooter in the San Bernardino shooting case in 2016. However, the company refused, saying that it cannot create a backdoor.“The FBI may use different words to describe this tool, but make no mistake: Building a version of iOS that bypasses security in this way would undeniably create a backdoor. While we believe the FBI’s intentions are good, it would be wrong for the government to force us to build a backdoor into our products. And ultimately, we fear that this demand would undermine the very freedoms and liberty our government is meant to protect,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said at that time.The FBI later dropped the case because it got help from an “outside source” to break into the device.","Federal Bureau of Investigation announced that they had ‘gained access’ to the shooter’s phone.

Microsoft hiring of AI startup's founder and key employees under scanner: What makes governments worried,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-hiring-of-ai-startups-founder-and-key-employees-under-scanner-what-makes-governments-worried/articleshow/111791590.cms,"What makes governments worried about AI mergers

What Microsoft said on the hiring

Microsoft Corp's investment in Inflection AI (artificial intelligence) is facing a full-blown antitrust investigation in the UK, according to Bloomberg, with regulators scrutinizing the hiring of a significant number of the startup's employees, reports Bloomberg.Microsoft hired Mustafa Suleyman as well as Inflection’s Chief Scientist and co-founder Karén Simonyan, along with most of the startup’s employees earlier this year.The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has announced the launch of a formal phase one merger probe into the partnership. The agency has a deadline of September 11 to decide whether to escalate the investigation to a more in-depth phase, Bloomberg reports.This move by the CMA comes amidst concerns that big tech companies are strategically investing in AI startups to stifle competition, according to Bloomberg. The agency has observed a pattern of large tech firms acquiring or investing in AI startups, potentially to control and influence the development of this nascent field.The CMA has previously used its merger control powers to assess similar deals, but in the case of Microsoft's investment in Mistral AI, the agency determined Microsoft did not gain enough control to influence Mistral's commercial activities, reports Bloomberg.The Microsoft-Inflection deal, however, appears to be structured differently. While Microsoft did pay Inflection $650 million, primarily to license its AI software, the key aspect was the hiring of a substantial portion of the startup's staff, according to a source familiar with the arrangement, as reported by Bloomberg.Governments in some countries are said to have become concerned about how the biggest technology companies are gobbling up the talent and products of innovative AI startups without formally acquiring them. According to a report by news agency AP, three members of the US Senate recently wrote to antitrust enforcers at the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), urging them to investigate Amazon's deal with San Francisco-based Adept. The deal will result in Adept's CEO and key employees going to Amazon and giving the e-commerce giant a license to Adept's AI systems and datasets.Microsoft maintains that ""hiring talent promotes competition and should not be treated as a merger,"" and is prepared to cooperate with the CMA's investigation, reports Bloomberg. This isn't an isolated incident. The report said that Amazon.com has also been actively recruiting talent from AI startups, including key executives and employees from Adept AI Labs.In a separate move seen as an attempt to avoid regulatory scrutiny, Microsoft recently abandoned plans to take board roles at OpenAI. Regulators in both the US and Europe had expressed concerns about Microsoft's potential influence over OpenAI. The CMA is yet to decide on whether to launch a probe into the OpenAI investment.",Microsoft Corp's investment in Inflection AI is facing a full-blown antitrust investigation in the UK.

"Apple gives 6 reasons to use Safari over Google Chrome on iPhones, Macs",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-gives-6-reasons-to-use-safari-over-google-chrome-on-iphones-macs/articleshow/111789598.cms,"How browsing generally works and users tracked online

Privacy on iPhone | Flock | Apple

Here’s how Safari addresses common tracking methods

Cross-site tracking prevention

Hides IP address from known trackers

Location data protections

Privacy-preserving web extensions

Blocks known trackers in Private Browsing

Removes unique trackers from URLs in Private Browsing

Apple is making a major push for user privacy with Safari browser. The company has detailed features that keeps users safe while they use Safari in their day to day life. For this, the company has launched a campaign highlighting six key areas where their browser protects user privacy. These include combating cross-site tracking , shielding location data, securing extensions, and offering enhanced Private Browsing with link protection.The campaign is launched as the Apple released iOS 18 public beta and macOS Sequoia public beta.Apple released a short video hinting at how web tracking works on browsers and how they may leave users vulnerable. It highlights that ‘other’ browsers follow users’ activity across websites, building a profile without their knowledge.They can expose location which means that data companies can pinpoint users’ location without permission. Not only websites, some extensions can access users’ data, compromising privacy. It also highlights that private browsing in other browsers may not fully protect users..Apple says with Safari, users get cross-site tracking blocked, essentially stopping companies from following them across the web. There’s location control where users decide when websites access their location. Thirdly, there is a choice of privacy-first extensions and finally, Safari offers advanced private browsing.Apple says that since the data companies are constantly evolving new techniques to track users, it created an Intelligent Tracking Prevention feature that uses machine learning to learn which domains are used to track users. It then isolates and purges the tracking data from the device. Intelligent Tracking Prevention is on by default when you use Safari.Safari also hides users’ IP address from known trackers. This is important because an IP address can be used to identify a user across websites and sessions, which can reveal the user’s precise location.Apple says Safari also combats fingerprinting – techniques to figure out who you are and where you browse. System configuration, fonts, plug-ins and even the screen resolution can be used as part of a fingerprint. A simplified version of the system configuration on Apple products makes it hard for trackers to single one out, it noted.Apple notes that Safari helps protect location data, which is another way that websites and data companies try to track users. To keep users in control, Safari does not share location data with any search engine. In cases where users need to provide location information, such as looking for places nearby, Safari gives users granular control by prompting ‘to share or not share’ data, or even choose “remember my decision for one day,"" to limit how long the website can use your location.Apple says that some extensions in other browsers can track what is on users’ screens. Safari, on the other hand, informs users about the information the extension can access before they enable it.Private Browsing in Safari doesn’t save the web pages that users have visited, the searches that have been made, or AutoFill information. Apple is also making these protections even stronger with Face ID and Touch ID.When users browse the web, they may notice that some links have added extra information to track you. Safari removes those links or unnecessary trackers appended to URLs that are shared in Messages and Mail, the company explained. This also works when browsing in Safari Private Browsing.","Apple is making a major push for user privacy with Safari browser.

More about Wiz, the US-Israeli cybersecurity company

Google's parent company, Alphabet, is reportedly negotiating to buy cybersecurity startup Wiz for a hefty $23 billion. This would be Alphabet 's largest acquisition ever. The deal isn't finalised yet, but if it goes through, Google could gain a significant advantage in competing against cloud giants Microsoft and Amazon Web Services (AWS).Experts believe the deal will strengthen Google's cloud security offerings for large companies, which is reportedly a prime target for hackers.“There is a hot market for cloud security,” Jerome Seguera, a senior intelligence analyst at the cybersecurity firm MalwareBytes, told news agency Reuters. Seguera added that Wiz gives customers “great visibility into their assets in a straightforward way” by offering tools that allow businesses to scan their infrastructure and specific software for threats.Moreover, by acquiring Wiz's technology, Google may look to gain an edge against cloud giants Amazon and Microsoft in the fight against growing ransomware threats. It should be noted that Alphabet acquired Mandiant two years ago for $5.4 billion.“I think they are trying to compete with Microsoft and to a smaller extent AWS (Amazon Web Services). Wiz is one of only a few who address a big chunk of the cloud security market in one platform,"" said Marc Bleicher, chief technology officer of the security firm Surefire Cyber.Wiz, a cybersecurity startup founded in 2020, capitalised on the pandemic-driven shift to remote work and cloud adoption. With a US-Israeli presence (headquarters in New York and engineering in Tel Aviv), the company is led by former Israeli intelligence veterans who previously founded another successful cloud security firm acquired by Microsoft.Wiz has experienced rapid growth, reaching a $12 billion valuation just two months ago, and is projected to hit $1 billion in annual revenue by 2025 with nearly $2 billion raised in venture capital.","Google's parent company, Alphabet, is reportedly negotiating to buy cybersecurity startup Wiz for a hefty $23 billion.

Verdict

Motorola expanded its Edge series in India recently with the launch of Motorola Edge 50 Fusion . Over the years, Motorola’s Edge series smartphones have become popular for their design and performance in terms of camera and display. The Edge 50 Fusion is no exception. It features a vegan leather texture on the rear and premium-looking colours.The smartphone runs Qualcomm Snapdragon 7s Gen 2 processor and comes with a starting price of Rs 22,999 (base variant).Motorola Edge 50 Fusion packs a host of features like Dolby Atmos surround sound, AI-powered shot optimization and audio zoom. We used the device for sometime and here’s our reviewWith the vegan leather back, Motorola Edge 50 Fusion gives a premium tactile experience. The smartphone is offered in three colour options – Forest Blue, Marshmallow Blue and Hot Pink. We got the Marshmallow Blue variant for review which looks good and further adds to the premiumness of the device.The leather back gives a sturdy hand grip of the Edge 50 Fusion without worrying for any scratches and dust. Motorola ships a pantone inspired cover with the phone. While Motorola provides a complimentary back cover, it's worth noting that it might slightly affect the phone's grip and feel.Motorola Edge 50 Fusion comes with curved edges on the front. There is a punch-hole display camera at the front. While the rear has a dual camera setup with large sensors aligned vertically. The LED flash light is placed beside the sensors.Weighing 175 grams, Motorola Edge 50 Fusion is a comparatively lightweight device. Left edge of the phone features three buttons – volume increase and decrease button placed above the power button. The bottom edge houses the Type-C port along with speakers, microphone and SIM tray slot.Overall, the smartphone looks premium for its price with a subtle design and colour. Having said that, we recommend using a back cover with the phone as it tends to get dirty easily.Motorola Edge 50 Fusion has a 6.67-inch full HD screen with 144Hz refresh rate and 2400x1080p resolution. The display is good with satisfactory colour production. However, the display lacks support for HDR. Nevertheless, the viewing experience is decent with deep contrast and punchy colours.The smartphone features adaptive brightness and adjusts itself as per the surrounding light. We did not face any issue while using the phone outdoors. Another feature worthy of mentioning is the edge lighting on Motorola Edge 50 Fusion that lights up the edges while receiving a notification or a call.The handset is also equipped with another feature called flicker prevention. Enabling it prevents the screen from flickering in dark environments. The phone is said to offer up to 600 nits of peak brightness which can be adjusted as well.Motorola Edge 50 Fusion comes powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 7s Gen 2 chipset with 4nm process. The smartphone has an octa-core CPU with four high-performance Arm Cortex-A78 cores clocked at 2.4Ghz speed. It is paired with four power-efficient Cortex-A55 cores at a clock speed of 1.95GHz. For graphics, Motorola Edge 50 Fusion has Adreno 710 GPU. The device was able to efficiently handle day-to-day tasks. We did not face any noticeable lag in the daily performance of the device. The handset can handle moderate gaming, though it tends to heat up during prolonged gaming sessions.Motorola Edge 50 Fusion packs up to 12GB RAM and up to 256GB internal storage capacity. The smartphone runs on Android 14 based Motorola’s Hello UI skin on the top. The phone has a comparatively clean UI with no third-party apps. Although you will find some Motorola’s own system apps. The company is giving three major Android OS updates with the phone in addition to four years of security patch, which is good if you are looking to buy a smartphone for prolonged years.One thing that got us worried was that the display, at times, does not immediately wake up when tapped on the locked screen.Coming to the audio of the Motorola Edge 50 Fusion, we really liked the sound quality. Equipped with Dolby Atmos surround sound, it manages to deliver an immersive audio experience. The handset also boasts of Spatial Audio which works with compatible media contents only. Users can also customize the audio settings for music, gaming, movies or podcasts. There is also a smart audio feature that identifies the content and performs automatic adjustments. You can also connect your smartphone to your TV and select advanced settings for the connected device.Motorola Edge 50 Fusion also has a Live Caption feature. Once enabled, it can detect speech on the device and automatically generate captions. The feature is available with a software update.Motorola Edge 50 Fusion has a dual camera setup on the back. There is a 50MP Sony Lytia700 C main sensor paired with a 13MP ultra-wide secondary sensor. During our review, we found the images to be slightly oversaturated with enhanced colours and contrast. Images captured using the phone are generally warm with a yellowish tint.The main sensor supports optical image stabilization (OIS) which reduces motion blur in the images. Photos captured in low-light are decent. There is enough detail in the image without any unnecessary noise.The 13MP ultra-wide camera gives a satisfactory performance in capturing wide-angle shots. For selfies and video calls, the phone has a 32MP camera at the front with f/2.4 aperture. Selfies captured by Motorola Edge 50 Fusion are good. The images do not look artificial. There is a slight skin tone correction, but not to the extent that it deviates from reality. The phone struggles to capture photos in the indoor artificial lighting using the front camera. Though no such issue was faced for outdoor images.The UI of the camera app is easy to navigate through. Camera features like portrait, slow motion, Pro mode and others are available right on the screen. So you don’t have to struggle to find them. We noticed that there is a lack of depth in the portrait shots with not satisfactory image detection.Motorola Edge 50 Fusion is backed by a 5,000mAh battery. The company ships a 68watt charger inside the box with a USB Type-C to Type-C charging cable. The phone can easily last a full day easily on a single charge. It takes almost an hour to fully charge the device.Some of the battery features on the phone include adaptive battery that limit battery for apps that are not in use. There is also a charge boost that can optimize charging by increasing the charging speed. However, the phone tends to heat up with this feature. Battery safety features are optimized charging and overcharge protection.Motorola Edge 50 Fusion delivers a striking balance between performance, camera and design. Packed with mid-range Snapdragon processor, Sony camera sensor and vegan leather back, the smartphone ticks most boxes. At Rs 22,999, the company has carved out a niche for Motorola Edge 50 Fusion, offering compelling features at an affordable price tag.",Motorola Edge 50 Fusion has a 6.67-inch full HD screen with 144Hz refresh rate and 2400x1080p resolution. There is a punch-hole display camera at the front. While the rear has a dual camera setup with large sensors aligned vertically.

UK government’s guidance on smartphone use by kids

In a major move, a posh boarding school in the UK has decided to swap its students’ smartphones for the classic Nokia phones, reports CBS News. The policy is based on guidelines from the UK government that allows school principals to enact smartphone bans on students during the school day.Eton College , the historic and elite British boarding school is located near the royal palace in Windsor. Prince William and Harry, Ian Fleming, Tom Hiddleston and novelist George Orwell are some of its notable alumni.As per the report, parents of first-year students at Eton College were informed about the changes in a letter. It reportedly said that the incoming 13-year-old boarders must transfer their SIM cards to offline Nokia phones given by schools. The phone will only be able to make phone calls and send text messages.The report quotes a school spokesperson who said “Eton routinely reviews our mobile phone and devices policy to balance the benefits and challenges that technology brings to schools.” He further added that those joining in Year 9, essentially the equivalent of freshman year in high school for American students, “will receive a 'brick' phone for use outside the school day, as well as a school-issued iPad to support academic study.”According to Ofcom, the UK government's communications regulator, 97% of children have their own smartphone phone by the age of 12. In the new guidelines issued in February this year, the government advised all schools to “have a behaviour policy which is aligned with the school’s legal duties and standards relating to the welfare of children.

Any attempts to transfer your number to a new SIM, even through contacting customer service, will be denied unless you disable Number Lock.
