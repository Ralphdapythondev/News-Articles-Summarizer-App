"Online radio, streaming apps help young Sindhis tune in to culture",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/online-radio-streaming-apps-help-young-sindhis-tune-in-to-culture/articleshow/109465336.cms,"A show is being shot for a Sindhi-language streaming service

NEW DELHI: For members of the Sindhi community in India, who left behind their land and their roots in Pakistan in post-Partition era and were forced to begin life afresh in India, the disconnect with their language and culture has been an inevitable casualty. Seven decades down the line, several young Sindhis are barely able to talk in their mother tongue, also seemingly disconnected with their heritage.One may argue that youths across communities have a disinterest towards their mother tongue. But for Sindhis, their relationship with language has been at the heart of the rupture with their identity, says Rita Kothari, academic and author of 'The burden of refuge: The Sindhi Hindus of Gujarat' (2009).Along came the stereotypes that classified Sindhis as 'austere', 'miserly' and its likes. ""Among youngsters, there used to be a sense of shame about one's identity. There was an idea what Sindhi culture won't take you anywhere. However, there is a difference now. There is more interest among Sindhi youths about their own identity and a realisation that there can be something different about being a Sindhi,"" says Kothari, who receives several questions and requests from youths who wish to know more about themselves.For the older generations who've witnessed the horrors of Partition, displacement fomented anger and resentment. This, combined with the burden of eking out a living and assimilating oneself with the host region in India, led to an estrangement with one's cultural identity. Many call Sindhis one of the most adaptable communities owing to their prowess to pick on the local language of the region they have settled in. But for the generations who have grown up in a post-Partition era that has provided them with education, jobs and equal opportunities in all spheres, there is a renewed interest in discovering stories of their homeland and a want to delve deeper into their identities.Stand-up comic Atul Khatri agrees things are changing on the ground now more than before. Khatri, who calls himself a proud Sindhi, says he has always used Sindhi in between sets and sometimes also makes ""jokes about us"". ""We are the ones who invented the tradition of ordering soup one by two, is my oft-used joke,"" he says, adding that many from his audience stay back after the show to greet him in Sindhi. Khatri is also working on a comedy special on Sindhi history. ""It's an attempt to pull in kids and make them know how proud we must be,"" he says.Dr Umesh Wadhavani, a nutrition specialist and Instagram influencer, believes that for the young and the youth to latch on to something, its 'cool factor' matters. Wadhawani - who rues the lack of popular youth icons who can stir interest within and outside the community - has recently started 'Chai Koki Nutrition', an Instagram page that debunks myths about Sindhi food and also educates viewers on gaining nutrition within one's staple food using Sindhi language .The argument that the young are less interested in their culture owing to sparse efforts on the front by popular figures isn't fully agreed on by 29-year-old singer and musician Laxman Gurdasani. Gurdasani made his foray into music at an early age, saved all the money he could and turned a bedroom in his Thane house into a studio where he now shoots The Sindh Show. Airing on YouTube , the show documents the journeys and achievements of notable members from the community. Launched in July last year, this show has garnered 19,000 followers on Instagram and 3,200 subscribers on YouTube. Tukka Tai, Sindhiyum, Terrible Sindhi Tales, are among other Instagram pages that have brought Sindhi quirks and customs to viewers across the internet.For those not on social media, a streaming online radio has proved to be a consistent gateway to access exclusive content in the language. Back in 1998, Ulhasnagar-based IT-professional Deepak Keswani uploaded Sindhi songs sung by his grandfather on the internet. The number of downloads was so encouraging that Keswani launched 'Radiosindhi.com' in 2011, which now boasts of ten stations and is being accessed by listeners outside India as well. ""Radio Sindhi is the first international Sindhi radio which is available in over 100 countries,"" says Keswani, adding that the radio attracts almost 1.5 lakh listeners including youngsters every month.Two years ago, gauging the lack of a Sindhi television channel, Vicky Rajani, a professional in the television industry, quit his job. Along with businessman Gurvinder Singh, he birthed an OTT app exclusively for Sindhi shows. Still in its infancy, the app, which was free for all until Feb this year, has eight shows featuring youth-oriented content, shows for kids and devotional shows for the elders. ""We do not dub. We create original shows,"" he says, adding that the app has been downloaded 8,000 times.",Sindhis left behind their land and roots in Pakistan in post-Partition era.

AI a 'fundamental change in the news ecosystem': Expert,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/ai-a-fundamental-change-in-the-news-ecosystem-expert/articleshow/109456421.cms,"PERUGIA: Artificial intelligence is shaking up journalism and in the short term will cause ""a fundamental change in the news ecosystem "", media expert David Caswell told AFP.A former employee at Yahoo! and BBC News Labs, the British broadcaster's innovation wing, Caswell spoke as industry leaders gathered in the Italian city of Perugia to discuss the biggest questions facing their trade.""We don't know. But what we are trying to do is to understand all of the possibilities or as many of the possibilities as we can. But I think there are some things that are becoming clearer: one is the fact that more media will probably be created and originated and sourced by machines. So machines will do more gathering in a lot of journalism, will do more of the producing, the audio, the video and the text, and will create the kind of experiences of consumption that consumers have.That is a very fundamental change in the information ecosystem in general, and the news ecosystem in particular. This is structurally different than the one that we're in now. We don't know how long it's going to take - it may be two, four, seven years. I think it's going to be faster because there is very little friction.People don't need news devices, new hardware, they don't need a lot of money as producers, they don't need technical expertise. All those things that were barriers in the previous generation of AI are no longer barriers, thanks to generative AI"".""One class of development is in new tools that enables AI workflow, for example JP Politikens in Denmark focused on making their existing products and activities more efficient. But it is also a basis for transitioning their products, their workforce, the activities into this new AI world.There is a tool that Google has built -- the code name is 'Genesis' -- that they are testing with publishers. Some publishers are building their own. There will be platform versions of these tools.These are tools, you bring your news gathering on the left side: your PDF, transcripts, audios, videos.. roughly. It helps you do things like analysis, summaries, turn into scripts, audios. They're orchestrated by the tool.What the journalist is doing is coordinating the tool, verifying the content all the way through to the end, and editing. The job becomes using the tool, like an editorial manager of this AI tool .It technically works. But that's a different thing than putting it in a newsroom in a large operation and use it day in day out, months in, months out. That's a big question: is it going to be enthusiastically adopted, to be used in a way that isn't very productive in the long run or will that enhance the productivity of newsroom dramatically?""""In the last decade it was very expensive. It was very difficult: You need the data, you had to build a data warehouse, have an enterprise deal with Amazon or Google cloud, you had to hire data scientists, to have a team of data engineers. it was a major investment. Only the BBC, the New York Times, this level of organisations could really afford it.That's not true with generative AI. You can run news workflow through interfaces that you pay 20 dollars a month. You don't need to be a coder. All you need is motivation, enthusiasm and curiosity.There's lots of people in news organisations that would not have been involved in AI in the past because they did not have the technical background and now they can just use it. It's a much more open form of AI: both smaller newsrooms can do a lot with, and more junior individuals in more established newsrooms can do a lot with. I think it's a good thing, but it's also a disruptive thing. Often the internal politics in newsrooms are disrupted by that"".""AI has been around since the 1950s. But AI for practical purposes appeared with ChatGPT. It's going to be quite a while -- years -- before we really understand how to use them for valuable things. There are so many things that you can do with them.The risk to journalism is that other organisations, start-ups, tech companies will do things in news faster than the news world itself. Lots of start ups have no editorial component at all. They are swiping the content of news organisations, some are covering niches: they are monitoring press releases, social media channels, PDF from reports"".""Journalism has not been doing well for the last 10 or 15 years, there hasn't really been a credible vision of the future for how this is going to play out just in the social media world. What AI does (is) it gives news organisations a chance to change that situation, to participate in a new ecosystem. It's good to be optimistic, getting engaged, exploring, having projects, experiments, maybe changing your mindset, that's positive.As Jelani Cobb, Dean of Columbia School of journalism, says: '+AI is unignorable force that journalism will have to organise itself around'. It's not going to adapt itself to journalism.","Artificial intelligence is shaking up journalism and in the short term will cause ""a fundamental change in the news ecosystem"", media expert David Caswell says.

Google Lens may seamlessly integrate with Search results



Google is expected to upgrade its artificial intelligence (AI)-based “Circle to Search” feature soon. This feature is designed for visual lookups , It allows users to circle an image or text on their device to prompt a Google Search for the highlighted content.The tech giant introduced this feature with the Samsung Galaxy S24 series in January. Despite having an innovative approach, some users have reportedly complained about experiencing issues with the feature triggering accidentally even when not intended.The tech giant is now planning to fix these “accidents”.During a recent episode of the Made by Google Podcast , Product Manager Erin Lynch and Director of Product Management Alistair Pott offered insights into the ongoing efforts the company is making to enhance the tool.The team acknowledged the feedback regarding the feature’s sensitivity and confirmed that they are committed to refining its activation process.Currently, the feature can automatically activate with a long press on the navigation bar or home button. This leads to unintended searches.Lynch emphasised that the team is focusing on ensuring that activations occur only when users intend them. However, none of them were able to offer any specific timeline for the fix.Circle to Search uses AI to analyse and process the on-screen content and offer users detailed search results ranging from definitions of words to information about objects to landmarks.The planned improvements are part of Google's broader strategy to refine user interaction with AI tools. This ensures that such features become more reliable and user-friendly.This enhancement may make the feature more practical for regular usage and may expand its utility across various contexts, from shopping to learning more about one’s surroundings.Furthermore, the podcast also explained that the Circle to Search feature uses Google Lens technology to perform its visual searches. This confirmation suggests that the company may be planning to integrate Google Lens more seamlessly with search results.The upcoming updates is expected to merge the search and lens result pages to enhance user experience and offer more cohesive and informative results.This integration process that promises a more streamlined interaction for users may take over several months.",The tech giant introduced this feature with the Samsung Galaxy S24 series in January.

The report also claoimed that the later on, the company may add other providers as well.The report also offered a glimpse of the animation that Google may display to users to help them get the phone aligned with a satellite. Just like iPhone’s system, in the coming days, Google’s SOS feature is also expected to provide Pixel owners with a series of questions to verify about the tool, the report noted.As per the report, these are some of the questions the feature will ask:In August 2023, a developer named Neil Rahmouni spotted some Google Messages code that suggested the the satellite-based Emergency SOS feature on Android was on its way.In a post on social media platform X, he claimed that Garmin , who offers such a service for its InReach 2-way messaging devices using the Iridium satellite network (which claims to reach “anywhere on earth”) will provide the feature for Google.Earlier in 2022, T-Mobile announced that it was partnering with Elon Musk’s SpaceX for a satellite messaging service for Android as well. However, the company didn’t specify its pricing. In January, Elon Musk shared an update about the project with a post on X saying that it was still in testing.It doesn’t matter which company (T-Mobile or Garmin) provides satellite connectivity for Android phones, the feature may not be available to users for free.However, to compete with Apple, (who subsidises its service for now) Google may also offer it for free for some time atleast.","Google is expected to launch its next-generation Pixel smartphones in October.

Why Samsung Galaxy S22 users in India and other countries may need to upgrade their smartphones,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/mobiles-tabs/why-samsung-galaxy-s22-users-in-india-and-other-countries-may-need-to-upgrade-their-smartphones/articleshow/109447808.cms,"How do older Galaxy S-series phones compare against newer models in Asia



Samsung Galaxy S22 users may soon need to upgrade their devices to current generation models. According to early findings from Ookla’s Speedtest Intelligence report, the latest Galaxy S24 models have outperformed their predecessors, especially S22 models in terms of 5G speed across several of countries. The report noted that while differences in speed between devices were minimal in some countries, Galaxy S24 models showed significant speed advantages over previous-generation Samsung devices in Asian markets India, South Korea, Thailand and others.As per the report, new as well as older models of the Samsung Galaxy S series showed strong performance in India. The newer models led for both 5G download speeds and 5G multi-server latency. While 5G speeds impressed across all generation models in the country.The Galaxy S24 models posted the top median 5G download speed at 302.43 Mbps and the lowest median 5G multi-server latency at 41.56 ms. On the other hand, Galaxy S22 devices showed the slowest speeds in India at 273.78 Mbps, while the Samsung Galaxy S23 was just slightly behind at 279.93 Mbps.Meanwhile, the iPhone 15 family, clocked in with a median 5G download speed of 285.78 Mbps.The report suggests consumers in India currently using S22 devices might want to upgrade to an S24 model. In this study, the new devices provided a nearly 30 Mbps speed advantage.However, with good 5G speeds across devices of all generations and similar speeds for devices in the Galaxy S22, S23 and iPhone 15 families, users may not feel a huge difference in their 5G experience from one device to another.In Hong Kong, the latest Galaxy S24 family performed particularly well and boasted a median 5G download speed of 165.74 Mbps and the lowest median 5G multi-server latency in the market at 21.74 ms.However, the S24’s median 5G download speed was statistically comparable to that of its older Samsung and iPhone 15 rivals. This makes choosing to upgrade more about new features than about performance.In Japan, Samsung devices offered similar 5G download speeds across older as well as the latest models.Meanwhile, in Indonesia, the Galaxy S23 models offered faster download speeds. Also, the speed offered by the iPhone 15 models was nearly 25 Mbps faster than its Samsung peers, the report added.In the Philippines, the latest Galaxy S24 models offered 20 Mbps and 15 Mbps faster speeds over S22 and S23 devices, respectively. However, 5G speeds offered by iPhone 15 models in this region were significantly lower than its Samsung rivals.Apart from this, in South Korea and Thailand, Samsung Galaxy S24 and iPhone 15 offered much faster 5G download speeds.","Latest Galaxy S24 models have outperformed their predecessors, especially S22 models in terms of 5G speed across several of countries.

OnePlus may soon launch its first-ever flip foldable phone: What to expect,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/mobiles-tabs/oneplus-may-soon-launch-its-first-ever-flip-foldable-phone-what-to-expect/articleshow/109447674.cms,"What to expect from OnePlus’ flip foldable phone



OnePlus is reportedly planning to launch its first-ever clamshell foldable phone soon. Rumours claim that the upcoming smartphone is likely to be a rebranded version of the upcoming Oppo Find N5 Flip phone and may even be better at taking pictures than the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5.In a post on the Chinese social media platform Weibo, a tipster named Smart Pikachu claimed that OnePlus’s parent company Oppo may add a telephoto lens to its next flip phone.According to a report by TechRadar, OnePlus is also expected to add the same lens to its first-ever flip phone as the companies often share the same hardware.If the rumours are to be true, the telephoto lens in OnePlus’ first-ever flip foldable phone can offer the model a significant advantage over other foldable options . The telephoto lens will not only offer a longer zoom range but will also produce more improved portrait photos.It’s important to note that most clamshell-designed phones (except the Oppo Find N3 Flip) don’t pack a telephoto lens. The rumoured flip phone is also likely to benefit from the same Hasselblad colour tuning that is available in most of the recent Oppo and OnePlus flagship phones. This includes last year’s foldable models like the OnePlus Open and Oppo Find N3 Flip.Earlier, rumours claimed that the Oppo Find N5 Flip had been cancelled by the company. However, the tipster’s post claimed that Oppo has not given up on foldable products.The report also suggests that the company’s development is half a year behind its competitors. This may lead to the smartphone maker dropping the plan for both flip phones.Moreover, Oppo has denied these claims and said Flip phones are a popular form factor, the report added. This suggests that the company is unlikely to give up on the Find N Flip series. The report also claims that these phones may shift to a OnePlus-only edition in the coming days.","OnePlus is reportedly planning to launch its first-ever clamshell foldable phone soon.

How it works

At the beginning of 2024, Samsung announced the Galaxy S24 with Google’s Circle to Search feature that’s still limited to Samsung flagships and Pixel smartphones. It appears that Microsoft is now planning to take on Google’s flagship search feature with its own version of Circle to Search called “Circle to Copilot”.Windows Latest has reported that Microsoft has been working on two new features for Edge on iOS .This includes “Circle to Copilot” and “Chat with image using Copilot”.Circle to Copilot feature isn’t new, the company has been working on it for a while now. It was also spotted within the Canary build of Windows 11 and it appears that Microsoft is planning to bring it to mobile version of Edge browser as well.Circle to Copilot, as mentioned, is Google’s Circle to Search alternative. The feature allows users to quickly run a search by simply circling a particular area on the screen. This also works by tapping or scribbling on the area of the screen.Once circled, scribbled or tapped, Edge will highlight the area and run the search to find the relevant information.While, the feature hasn’t been spotted on the Android version of Edge browser as of now, iPad and iPhone users can certainly give the feature a try. Here’s how to enable it.Enabling ""Circle to Copilot"" in Microsoft Edge for iOS allows users to tap and hold the Copilot button to capture the screen and open a ""Circle"" page. Here, users draw circles around specific areas for Copilot to search. Similar to Google's Circle to Search, this feature streamlines information retrieval.

Microsoft has finally resolved a major Windows 11 bug that prevented Windows 10 users from upgrading to the latest version of Windows. The issue surfaced due to an Intel driver conflict . The tech giant, as per Windows Latest report, has now lifted the upgrade block on affected PCs, allowing those users to make the jump to Windows 11.The issue, first flagged in November 2021, caused recurring Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) errors for Windows 10 PCs running Intel's 11th-generation Core processors with specific versions of the Intel SST driver (10.29.0.5152 or 10.30.0.5152).To prevent the problem, Microsoft enforced a compatibility block preventing those systems from upgrading to Windows 11After over a year, Microsoft has updated the bug's status to ""resolved"" on its health dashboard. The only fix was for users to manually update to the latest compatible Intel SST driver version from the manufacturer's website before attempting the Windows 11 upgrade – a cumbersome process for many.Now, Microsoft will offer the latest Intel driver through Windows Update, after which affected users should see the option to upgrade to Windows 11 within 48 hours.For those who don't receive the driver update automatically, Microsoft recommends contacting the device's manufacturer for the compatible version.The resolution comes as Microsoft continues to struggle to convince users to adopt Windows 11. As of March 2024, Windows 10 remains the dominant operating system with 69.2% market share according to StatCounter, while Windows 11 lags far behind at just 26.71% adoption despite an 8% year-over-year increase.While it is a good thing that Microsoft has finally fixed the long-known bug and allowed stuck Windows 10 users to upgrade to Windows 11.

The company plans to update its entire Mac lineup with the new M4 chips, with the first models expected to launch as early as the end of 2024.As reported by Gurman in his Power On newsletter, Apple has internally tested an M3 Ultra chip suitable for the Mac Studio and Mac Pro.However, he states that it is ""all but assured that at least some of Apple's high-end desktops"" will skip the M3 chip series and move directly to the M4 family.The M4 chip line will come in at least three main varieties: an entry-level version called Donan, more powerful models named Brava, and a top-end chip codenamed Hidra. According to people familiar with the matter, Apple aims to showcase the AI processing capabilities of these components and demonstrate how they will seamlessly integrate with the upcoming version of macOS, set to be announced at the company's annual developer conference in June.Gurman outlined the expected order of the M4 Mac releases:1. A low-end 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M4, coming around the end of 2024.2. A 24-inch iMac with the M4, also expected around the end of the year.3. New 14-inch and 16-inch high-end MacBook Pros with M4 Pro/Max chips, due between the end of 2024 and early 2025.4. A Mac mini in both M4 and M4 Pro configurations, coming between the end of 2024 and early 2025.5. New 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Airs, slated for around spring 2025.6. A Mac Studio with a high-end M4 chip, coming around the middle of 2025.7. A Mac Pro with an M4 Ultra chip, due in the second half of 2025.In addition to the M4 upgrades, Apple is considering allowing its highest-end Mac desktops to support up to half a terabyte of memory, addressing customers' complaints about the memory limitations of Apple's in-house chips compared to previous Intel-powered machines.This move comes at a critical juncture for Apple, as Mac sales have experienced a significant decline in the past year. The company hopes that the AI-focused M4 chips will breathe new life into its computer business and help it catch up with competitors like Microsoft and Google in artificial intelligence.As Apple prepares for the AI-centric M4 Macs, the company plans to preview a host of new AI features across its product lineup at the upcoming developer conference in June.","Apple is gearing up to introduce a new lineup of Macs powered by the M4 chips, which will bring artificial intelligence capabilities to every model.

The company is experimenting with displaying promoted apps in the ""Recommended"" section, which echoes its previous attempts to integrate ads into its operating system .Currently limited to Windows Insiders in the Beta Channel within the United States , the ads should help users discover apps from the Microsoft Store , says Microsoft.By placing promoted apps alongside recently installed and frequently used programs, Microsoft hopes to increase exposure for its store offerings.While the promoted apps can be disabled through the Settings app, some users argue that this adds to the growing list of toggles and settings that need to be adjusted to achieve a clean, ad-free Windows 11 experience. The lack of a clear ""Promoted"" label next to the app name has also raised concerns about transparency, as users may not immediately realise that they are being presented with an advertisement rather than a personally relevant recommendation.Microsoft is seeking feedback on the changes, suggesting that the company may be open to modifying or removing the feature based on user response. The Windows Insider team has stated that the experiment will not apply to commercial devices managed by organisations, perhaps acknowledging the potential for disruption in professional settings.Critics of the move argue that Microsoft should focus on refining the Start menu's functionality and customization options rather than using it as a vehicle for advertising. Some have pointed out that the company already has ample opportunities to showcase its store offerings through the Microsoft Store app itself, as well as through other channels such as email newsletters and targeted online ads.Microsoft has a history of incorporating ads into its Windows operating system, with previous versions featuring promotional spots on the lock screen and Start menu. The company even briefly tested ads within the File Explorer of Windows 11 last year before turning off the experiment due to negative feedback from users.

It's undeniable that women in video games were once overlooked or portrayed poorly, but fortunately, the landscape is changing. Developers and publishers now recognize that women play games, deserve well-written narratives, and games with female protagonists can be successful.Games with female protagonists are becoming more prevalent as developers shift away from traditional male characters.Indie games , in particular, excel at creating complex and flawed female characters. Explore this list of exceptional games featuring compelling female protagonists, sourced from The Gamer website.When considering standout roguelike games, titles like Hades, Dead Cells, and Slay the Spire often come to mind. However, Returnal by PlayStation and Housemarque stands out by offering excellent female representation with its protagonist, astronaut Selene Vassos (voiced by Jane Perry from Hitman). Selene navigates a planet trapped in a time loop, uncovering dual mysteries.Following a signal called 'The White Shadow' at the start of each loop, Selene encounters strange occurrences, including an unfamiliar house that appears amidst the alien landscape. Atropos, the planet, is teeming with hostile alien swarms and challenging bosses, creating a bullet-hell-like experience as Selene seeks answers.In prior Remedy games, the studio often featured tough male protagonists, but this changed with the 2019 release of Control. The game introduced Jesse Faden, a bold and courageous character who rises to become Director of the Federal Bureau of Control, wielding gravity-defying powers.Playing as Jesse, you'll have an exhilarating experience using her unique weapon and upgrades to battle the paranatural entities known as the Hiss, which have overrun the FBC. Jesse is also driven by the quest to uncover answers about her brother Dylan. The game stars Courtney Hope, who also portrayed Beth Wilder in Quantum Break, and shares connections with the Alan Wake universe.Amicia de Rune and Amanda Ripley both excel in keeping their composure in stealth horror gameplay, but Amicia faces daunting challenges like massive rat swarms and Inquisitor soldiers while protecting her brother Hugo throughout the game.Both ""A Plague Tale: Innocence"" and its sequel ""A Plague Tale: Requiem"" offer stunning and intense mediaeval adventures in a rat-infested world, showcasing exceptional graphics and set pieces for a Double-A title. The emotionally gripping story rivals games like ""The Last of Us,"" with performances by Amicia and Hugo that could earn Oscars.Although titled ""Alan Wake,"" Remedy's official sequel to the 2010 horror game shifts focus to Saga Anderson's pivotal role in aiding Alan's escape from the Dark Place. Saga serves as a central narrative figure alongside Alan and his wife Alice. As a playable FBI agent investigating Bright Falls and Alan's disappearance, Saga unravels mysteries while saving her daughter and reconstructing her own life.The gameplay alternates between Saga and Alan across separate ""Return"" and ""Initiation"" chapters, mirroring the manuscript structure. With twists and revelations tying together, Alan Wake 2's intense horror atmosphere, inspired by Silent Hill, challenges Saga beyond her agency expectations.Oxenfree may appear to be a charming game with puzzles, branching dialogue, and unique watercolour art, but it delves deeply into relatable life issues with its two female protagonists. The first game features teenager Alex, while the sequel, Lost Signals, introduces the older and more experienced Riley.This series excels in portraying well-written female characters. Alex grapples with grief, friendship, and the search for meaning, while Riley navigates career doubts and future parenting concerns. Even Olivia, the antagonist in the second game, evokes empathy with her motives.In Night in the Woods, the protagonist is Mae Borowski, a college dropout in her 20s who returns to her hometown of Possum Springs after grappling with mental health issues. Despite the cast being anthropomorphic animals, the game delves into important themes with sensitivity.Fans connect with Mae because her struggles are genuine and relatable, driving the plot as she reconnects with her hometown and discovers its changes since she left.The Final Fantasy series has introduced us to many excellent female party members over the years, but it's rare to see one take on a starring role. However, in games like the Final Fantasy 13 trilogy and the Yuffie DLC for Final Fantasy 7 Remake, we see exceptions to this. Among these, Final Fantasy 6 stands out as one of the series' best entries, featuring not one, but two female leads.Terra's struggle with her lineage and past reveals her mental strength, while her physical prowess is evident from the start of the game. Similarly, Celes' resilience on the island with Cid demonstrates her mental toughness and ability to overcome depression, ultimately reuniting the party and leading to Kefka's defeat.Valve doesn't release new games frequently since the advent of Steam, but when they do, they are typically exceptional. The original Portal game was a brilliantly crafted physics-based adventure that captured gamers' imaginations, and its sequel surpassed expectations. Beyond the enjoyable gameplay and puzzles, the games excel in the captivating relationship between protagonist Chell and the psychotic AI system, GLaDOS.Despite being a silent protagonist, Chell is far from a shallow character. Enduring GLaDOS's insults and a seemingly hopeless situation, she persists in her testing, hoping to secure her freedom. This perseverance leads to a thrilling and fast-paced climax.Clementine doesn't take centre stage in the Telltale series until the second season, but she's often regarded as the highlight of the games. After Telltale closed, Robert Kirkman assembled a team to complete the game, ensuring fans could see Clementine's story through to its conclusion.In the first season, Clementine is looked after by Lee, and when he passes away, she embarks on her own journey and begins caring for another young child, similar to how Lee cared for her.Assassin's Creed Syndicate features two protagonists, Evie and Jacob Frye, with Evie being the older twin sister. As a British assassin in the Victorian era, Evie gained popularity quickly and remains one of the series' most beloved characters. Despite not having the entire game focused on her, Evie has many memorable moments and scenes in Syndicate that enhance the gameplay experience.Following the success of the Resident Evil 2 remake, a remake of Resident Evil 3 features Jill Valentine and Carlos Oliveira. Jill, a beloved character in the series, faces the intelligent bio weapon Nemesis after being attacked in her apartment. The game revolves around Jill's escape from Raccoon City while evading Nemesis's relentless pursuit. Some reviewers have likened Resident Evil 3's remake to Resident Evil 2's quality.Half-Life: Alyx is a VR instalment in the Half-Life series, focusing on Alyx Vance's quest to aid the resistance against the Combine.

She is a ""Runner,"" tasked with delivering essential items to resistance groups evading government control. Faith possesses extraordinary abilities and plays a central role in the games' intricate storylines.Silent Hill is a cherished survival horror series known for its unsettling imagery. Silent Hill 3 serves as a direct sequel to the first game, following Heather Mason, daughter of the original protagonist, Harry Mason. As Heather searches for her father, she encounters a world that twists into a darker and more sinister reality, where the line between truth and illusion blurs.Resident Evil 2 was highly acclaimed upon release, winning multiple Game of the Year awards due to its exceptional quality. The game features two protagonists, Leon S. Kennedy and the iconic Claire Redfield. Claire is celebrated as a beloved and formidable character in the Resident Evil series, and in this game, players assist her in escaping Raccoon City during a viral outbreak.Assassin's Creed Odyssey offers players the choice to play as Kassandra, a highly favoured protagonist in the series. Many players prefer Kassandra over Alexios due to her strong character design and voice acting. The game also introduces romance options and allows players to portray their character as a member of the LGBTQ+ community, adding to its inclusive features.In the sequel to The Last of Us, the focus shifts from Joel's journey to Ellie's struggle in a brutal world. Alongside Ellie, players also step into the shoes of the main antagonist, Abby.While some events and characters in the game were controversial, Abby's perspective offered a unique lens to the story, challenging players to reconsider their views on Joel and Ellie. This shift in perspective adds depth and complexity to the narrative, prompting a reevaluation of familiar characters and events.Tales of Berseria, the first game in the Tales series to feature a female protagonist, stands out as one of the best entries in years. The game follows Velvet Crowe, who witnesses her quiet village devastated by daemons due to an event known as Daemonblight.Velvet's transformation into a daemon-eating creature sets her apart as an unconventional female JRPG character. She embodies the role typically associated with male characters—a fierce, revenge-driven monster slayer.The original Tomb Raider games featured a tough female protagonist, but she was often depicted in skimpy attire and with exaggerated proportions. The modern Lara Croft is a more realistically portrayed and suitably dressed character. She transcends the archetype of a ""strong female protagonist"" to become a fully developed character with flaws, growth, and humanity. Despite some narrative dissonance where Lara exhibits emotional reactions to certain situations but then engages in intense combat shortly after, Lara's character development remains compelling and well-crafted.Celeste is a game that delves into themes of anxiety, personal growth, and existential challenges. It features outstanding platforming mechanics and a compelling female protagonist named Madeline (not Celeste, which is the mountain). Madeline's ascent up the mountain mirrors the hero's journey, with moments of growth, setbacks, and transformation along the way. She embarks on this journey for her own sense of accomplishment and pride. As the player, you guide her toward her goal.The iconic reveal in the original Metroid, where we learned Samus Aran is a woman, remains a memorable moment. This space bounty hunter fights pirates and navigates hostile terrain with remarkable skill. While Samus isn't deeply developed in terms of writing or dialogue, she shines through her actions. Across different games, Samus explores diverse planets, facing unique dangers and uncovering mysteries. With her intellect and physical prowess, Samus fulfils her missions, providing an enjoyable experience for players. Additionally, her suit and ship designs remain iconic and timeless in gaming history.The Uncharted series follows Nathan Drake and his close bond with Victor Sullivan. Across the mainline games, Drake teams up with Sully to tackle numerous challenges. The introduction of Lost Legacy was a welcome addition, offering players the chance to play as Chloe, a fan-favourite supporting character. Paired with Nadine, a South African mercenary leader, Chloe embarks on her own Uncharted adventure, showcasing witty banter and teamwork with two strong female leads, providing a refreshing experience.Bayonetta exudes toughness and confidence, unafraid to confront any challenge, even defying deities. She faces danger head-on, turning combat into a thrilling and stylish spectacle. Bayonetta's posh English accent and librarian glasses add an intriguing contrast to her fierce actions. The game's focus on both style and substance creates a balanced and enjoyable action experience.Ellen Ripley is a beloved cinematic icon known for her bravery in sci-fi and horror films. In Alien: Isolation, you step into the shoes of Ripley's daughter, Amanda, facing peril on the Sevastopol space station. Amanda uses her intelligence to outsmart deadly pursuers, including the xenomorph, while crafting weapons and navigating her environment to survive. She embodies her mother's courage and resourcefulness.Child of Light features Aurora, a young girl navigating a fantasy world as she copes with grief and depression. This beautifully designed game immerses players in a fairy tale setting, where Aurora's journey is a metaphor for overcoming inner darkness. Aurora's strength, both physical and mental, allows her to triumph over challenges, including her own struggles with depression. Child of Light is a delightful and accessible game suitable for all ages.Senua, the protagonist of Hellblade, is a remarkable female lead grappling with her own mental struggles. As she battles illusions, demons, and sensory distortions, her journey into Helheim unfolds as a deeply compelling exploration of inner turmoil and resilience. Senua's story presents a complex portrayal of a woman fighting against her inner demons, offering profound insights into mental health and survival.Aloy from Horizon: Zero Dawn stands out as one of the most celebrated female protagonists in gaming. She embodies strength, intelligence, charm, and resourcefulness in a beautifully crafted post-apocalyptic world filled with unique challenges and encounters. Aloy's character is a refreshing example of a powerful woman without being stereotyped or overly sexualized, making her an exemplary video game protagonist.","Games with female protagonists are becoming more prevalent as developers shift away from traditional male characters.
