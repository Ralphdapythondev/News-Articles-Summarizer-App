CEO of 19 tech companies sentenced to 6 years prison for selling fake Cisco equipment,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ceo-of-19-tech-companies-sentenced-to-6-years-prison-for-selling-fake-cisco-equipment/articleshow/109795395.cms,"Counterfeit equipment was sold to both govt & private sector companies

Authorities aware of fraud for years

Sentence aimed to send strong message

A Miami-based tech CEO, Onur Aksoy (also known as Ron Aksoy and Dave Durden), has been sentenced to over six years in prison for running a large-scale operation selling fake Cisco equipment .Aksoy pleaded guilty in June 2023 to charges including conspiracy, mail fraud, and wire fraud. Through 19 companies and online storefronts operating from 2013 to 2022, he resold counterfeit Cisco products with an estimated retail value exceeding $1 billion.These entities, collectively known as Pro Network Entities, sold the fake networking products on Amazon and eBay.As part of the plea agreement, Aksoy is required to pay $100 million in restitution to Cisco and other victims.The counterfeit equipment infiltrated critical infrastructure, compromising both private and public sectors. This included sensitive U.S. government systems used by the Navy, Air Force, and Army. The fake parts jeopardized operations for fighter jets, bombers, helicopters, and maritime patrol aircraft.Furthermore, schools and hospitals were also unknowingly affected by the shoddy equipment, which often malfunctioned or failed entirely after installation.Aksoy's fraudulent activity was detected by U.S. authorities and Cisco as early as 2014. Counterfeit shipments were seized, and Aksoy was ordered to cease operations. However, he continued the scheme with the help of Chinese suppliers. These suppliers would modify used or discarded Cisco products to appear legitimate and install pirated software.Vikas Khanna, US attorney, emphasised the vastness of the operation and the potential harm caused. The sentencing, he stated, holds Aksoy accountable for the ""breathtaking scale"" of the counterfeit scheme.Cisco is said to have faced challenges in recent years due to supply chain disruptions, making it more vulnerable to counterfeit activity.","Onur Aksoy, a Miami-based tech CEO, has been sentenced to over six years in prison for running a large-scale operation selling fake Cisco equipment.

Android apps

Partnered with governments worldwide, including India

Safety through verification

Good news for Android users. Google Play Store is now making it easier to identify legitimate government apps . After months of testing, official badges are rolling out in over 14 countries to clearly mark state and federal government apps. This initiative aims to tackle the issue of fake apps impersonating official/government ones to steal data or money.Google said that these badges currently cover more than 2,000 apps in countries including Australia, Canada, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Japan, South Korea, the United States, Brazil, Indonesia, India, and Mexico. In November 2023, the company teased this feature when it announced new rules for app developers.Look for the new ""Government"" badge displayed prominently on official apps. Tapping the badge reveals a message confirming Play Store's verification of the app's affiliation with a government entity. These badges will also be visible in app listings like ""Top Charts.""Google has partnered with governments and their developers to ensure a smooth rollout of these badges. This is particularly important in regions like India, where fake government apps have been a concern.It's important to note that Google Play Store already has policies in place to prevent misleading apps. These policies prohibit apps with deceptive descriptions, icons, or screenshots, especially those claiming to be official. Additionally, Google's rules specifically target apps that falsely represent government affiliation or offer unauthorized services.For secure processing of government documents within apps, Google may request developers to submit authorization proof. Furthermore, Google encourages governments to use official email addresses when creating developer accounts for publishing apps on the Play Store.This update from Google Play Store empowers users to make informed choices when downloading government-related apps, promoting a safer and more reliable mobile experience.","Google Play Store is now making it easier to identify legitimate government apps.

What Amazon has to say



Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has violated federal labour law in the US. According to a report by CNBC, a National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) judge has ruled that the CEO of the e-commerce major violated the country’s labour laws while discussing unionisation efforts at the company with media outlets.The report notes that NLRB Administrative Law Judge Brian Gee cited multiple interviews Jassy gave in 2022.The interviews also coincided when union campaigns in Amazon’s warehouse and delivery operations were at their peak.In an interview with CNBC in April 2022, Jassy said that if employees were to vote in a union, they may be less empowered in the workplace and things would become “much slower” and “more bureaucratic.”Similarly, in another Bloomberg interview, Jassy stated: “If you see something on the line that you think could be better for your team or you or your customers, you can’t just go to your manager and say, ‘Let’s change it.’”Again, at the DealBook conference, Jassy said that without a union the workplace isn’t “bureaucratic, it’s not slow.”The NLRB filed a complaint against Amazon and Jassy the same year.Judge Gee ruled that Jassy’s comments “threatened employees that, if they selected a union, they would become less empowered and would find it harder to get things done quickly.”During his ruling, Gee also noted (spotted by CNBC) that Jassy’s other comments that unionisation would change workers’ relationship with their employers were lawful. However, the Amazon chief’s other remarks that employees would be less empowered and “better off” without a union violated labour law in the country, “because they went beyond merely commenting on the employee-employer relationship.”The judge has ordered Amazon to stop making such comments in the coming days. The NLRB has also asked the company to post and distribute a notice about the order to employees in the US.In a statement to CNBC, Amazon spokesperson Mary Kate Paradis said that the company disagrees with the NLRB’s ruling and that it intends to appeal.“The decision reflects poorly on the state of free speech rights today, and we remain optimistic that we will be able to continue to engage in a reasonable discussion on these issues where all perspectives have an opportunity to be heard,” Paradis explained.","A National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) judge has ruled that the CEO of the e-commerce major violated the country’s labour laws while discussing unionisation efforts at the company.

The company stated it was finalizing paid contracts after successful trials with several Fortune 500 companies and investment firms.The new funds will be used for product development, hiring, and marketing efforts.With the rising demand for AI tools, like OpenAI's ChatGPT, that expedite tasks, users are increasingly looking for ways to safeguard their data and prevent security threats and inappropriate data infiltration.""There's a whole new landscape of threats and risks involving AI models,"" Matan Derman, Apex's CEO, told Reuters.

Speculations in the tech world suggest that OpenAI is gearing up for a major announcement, possibly a new search engine . According to Jimmy Apples, who reports the claim as an insider, the company is planning an event this month (May), tentatively scheduled for May 9, 2024, at 10 am.This speculation is fueled by OpenAI's recent hiring spree for an events team, starting in January.""They were actively recruiting for in-house event staff and event marketing back in January, and just hired an events manager last month,"" shared Jimmy Apples, hinting at a significant event potentially in June where OpenAI might unveil its next big project, ""whatever Sam [Altman, CEO] decides to call it.""Furthermore, Jimmy Apples suggests a flurry of activity within OpenAI since late April. ""There have been at least 50 new internal subdomains created since April 24th.""According to media reports, if these rumors hold weight, OpenAI's search engine could preempt Google I/O, scheduled for May 14th, 2024. This could also render Perplexity AI obsolete, especially considering Microsoft 's recent ban on employee use due to security concerns.Reports have indicated that OpenAI has been developing a web search product, potentially intensifying competition with Google. The service might leverage Bing's infrastructure to some extent. In a recent podcast with Lex Fridman, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman acknowledged the potential of large language models (LLMs) in search: ""The perfect marriage of LLMs and search hasn't been achieved yet. I'd love to tackle that challenge, it would be exciting.""However, Altman emphasized OpenAI's desire to avoid simply replicating Google Search. ""I find the current model boring. The question shouldn't be about building a 'better' Google Search. It's about fundamentally improving information discovery, utilization, and synthesis,"" he explained.OpenAI's potential search app follows Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella's declaration last year to ""make Google dance"" by integrating OpenAI's GPT models into Bing. With both tech giants vying for search dominance, the landscape could be set for a significant shift in how users access information online.","Speculations in the tech world suggest that OpenAI is gearing up for a major announcement, possibly a new search engine.

Universal Music Group (UMG), which blasted TikTok for its ""exploitative"" tactics, has announced a multi-dimensional licensing agreement with the Chinese app that will bring songs by UMG ’s global family of artists, songwriters and labels on the short video-sharing platform. This means that songs by popular artists Taylor Swift , Drake and others will be back on TikTok.With the new deal in place, one billion-plus content creators and users will be able to use UMG music to make videos on the platform.“This new chapter in our relationship with TikTok focuses on the value of music, the primacy of human artistry and the welfare of the creative community. We look forward to collaborating with the team at TikTok to further the interests of our artists and songwriters and drive innovation in fan engagement while advancing social music monetization,” said Sir Lucian Grainge, chairman and CEO, Universal Music Group.The agreement between the two organisations focuses on two key areas. Firstly, both TikTok and UMG will collaborate to develop new ways for artists to generate revenue using TikTok's growing e-commerce features. Secondly, UMG will leverage TikTok's reach to promote its artists across all music genres and regions around the world through joint marketing campaigns.“Music is an integral part of the TikTok ecosystem and we are pleased to have found a path forward with Universal Music Group,” added Shou Chew, CEO of TikTok.Earlier this year, UMG started removing the music catalogues of artists the label represents after negotiations to renew licensing agreements with TikTok broke down. The previous licensing agreement between UMG and TikTok expired on January 31.UMG also accused the app of offering unfair compensation compared to other social media giants, failing to protect artists from piracy and even actively promoting the creation of AI-generated music that could potentially replace human artists.","Universal Music Group has announced a multi-dimensional licensing agreement with the Chinese app. UMG will bring songs by its global family of artists, songwriters and labels on the short video-sharing platform.

You are enough just as you are.

A captivating romance can uplift anyone's spirits, and anime has a unique ability to vividly portray these narratives. Over the years, Japanese animation has delivered numerous romantic tales, ranging from light-hearted comedies to deeply emotional dramas.For romance enthusiasts, going through so many anime options can be overwhelming. However, there are several exceptional romance anime series that truly shine above the rest.Here is a curated list of top romance anime series , compiled by Game Rant, along with their respective rankings.Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie stirred mixed reactions upon its debut in Spring 2022, often compared to ""My Dress-Up Darling"" but standing out as a unique slice-of-life anime centred around a charming couple, Shikimori and Yuu Izumi.One distinctive aspect of the series is its portrayal of the main couple already in a relationship, a rarity in anime. While the episodes focus on everyday moments, they paint a wholesome picture of young love with two endearing characters navigating the nuances of romance.Describing Bakemonogatari as a straightforward romance might be a stretch, but this instalment of Monogatari indeed focuses on and highlights the relationship between Koyomi Araragi and Hitagi Senjougahara. Their initial interactions are unconventional, involving a stapler to the face, but Araragi's determination to assist Senjougahara with her curse ultimately brings them closer.Despite the surreal and eccentric nature of Monogatari, the romance between Araragi and Senjougahara is remarkably grounded and healthy. While the series introduces other potential romantic interests, their relationship remains steadfast and central to the narrative.""Sing 'Yesterday' for Me"" presents romance in a refreshingly realistic manner compared to many other anime. The series takes a classic love triangle and steers it in an unexpected direction by the end, resulting in a highly satisfying conclusion that portrays how failed romances can evolve into strong friendships.Directed by Yoshiyuki Fujiwara, known for his work on popular anime like ""Attack on Titan"" and ""Sword Art Online,"" the shift to a show with such a different tone demonstrates his versatility and mastery in storytelling across diverse genres.""My Happy Marriage"" emerged as one of the standout romance anime of Summer 2023, adapted from Akumi Agitogi's novel series. Set in an alternate Meiji Restoration era with supernatural elements, the story follows Miyo, who endures mistreatment from her stepfamily despite her privileged background. Her family arranges her marriage to a notorious military figure known for rejecting wives quickly, with rejection spelling disaster for Miyo. However, Kiyoka surprises everyone by taking an interest in Miyo and becoming incensed by her family's cruelty.The anime delves into the lasting impact of Miyo's abuse, highlighting her struggle to regain self-worth, even with Kiyoka's support. Kiyoka himself is a complex character with hidden motives behind his initial attraction to Miyo, although his feelings for her are genuine.While the romance between Miyo and Kiyoka is heartwarming, ""My Happy Marriage"" falls short in other areas. The supernatural elements can seem disjointed, and the villains are one-dimensional despite being detestable.Based on Fumita Yanagida's popular and finished manga, ""Tomo-chan Is a Girl!"" stood out as one of Winter 2023's most amusing romantic comedies. Tomo and Jun share a close friendship, but Jun sees Tomo strictly as a friend, unaware of her romantic feelings.While romance is central to its characters, ""Tomo-chan Is a Girl!"" leans heavily into comedy. Tomo and Jun's dynamic is charming, and they're supported by entertaining characters like Misuzu and Carol. Despite its comedic tone, the chemistry between Tomo and Jun develops convincingly over the season. Unlike some romance anime, Tomo-chan excels in portraying why its leads are compatible without difficulty.Teen romance anime often dominate the genre, but there are exceptions worth noting. ""Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku"" is primarily a workplace comedy that revolves around two couples: the newly formed pair of Hirotaka Nifuji and Narumi Momose, and the more established couple, Tarou Kabakura and Hanako Koyanagi. The focus remains on Hirotaka and Narumi, with the series emphasising humour over romance, but Tarou and Hanako's relationship is depicted realistically.Despite being childhood friends, Narumi struggles to see Hirotaka as a potential romantic interest, a dynamic that persists throughout the series. The anime's brevity limits the depth of these relationships, but ""Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku"" provides an entertaining journey within its runtime.""Romantic Killer"" cleverly parodies romance and harem anime while paying homage to their core strengths. Anzu, a girl with no interest in boys, is suddenly thrust into a reverse harem scenario by a magical being, disrupting her life of gaming and chocolate consumption. Unamused by her newfound romantic entanglements with unfamiliar guys, Anzu navigates this unconventional situation with scepticism.Primarily a comedy, ""Romantic Killer"" aims to elicit laughter from its audience, often succeeding with its humour rooted in its origins as a shonen manga, characterised by exaggerated facial expressions.Though not always aiming for emotional depth, the anime treats its characters and their relationships seriously. Anzu shines as a compelling lead, and the male characters introduced as potential partners are well-developed. ""Romantic Killer"" offers a delightful blend of humour and romance for those seeking an entertaining and unconventional love story.""The Angel Next Door Spoils Me Rotten"" captivates viewers from the start for several reasons. Firstly, Project No.9's animation is impressive, featuring clean and detailed character designs. Secondly, and most importantly, the main characters exhibit instant chemistry, evident when Amane offers his umbrella to a soaked Mahiru, sparking a connection.Throughout the series, despite the frequent presence of both leads on screen, ""The Angel Next Door Spoils Me Rotten"" effectively delves into their individual personalities while also developing their friendship.Rumiko Takahashi is celebrated as a legendary mangaka, known for classics like Inuyasha, Ranma 1/2, and Urusei Yatsura. While most of her renowned works fall within the shonen genre, Takahashi has also ventured into seinen storytelling. Maison Ikkoku stands out as one of her most mature works, emphasising romance as its primary theme.Unlike Takahashi's prominent shonen series that explore various genres such as comedy and action alongside romance, Maison Ikkoku focuses squarely on romantic elements, enriched with drama, character development, and humour.The central relationship features Kyouko and Yuusaku, both drawn to each other but hindered by their circumstances. Kyouko, grieving the recent loss of her husband, is hesitant to move forward. Meanwhile, Yuusaku, deeply in love with Kyouko, doubts his worthiness as a student. The anime chronicles their journeys of growth, healing, and mutual misunderstanding, complemented by well-developed secondary characters.Insomniacs After School emerged as the standout romance of Spring 2023, adapted from Makoto Ojiro's esteemed seinen manga. The story revolves around two students plagued by insomnia, a burden they carried alone until they met at their school's observatory. Isaki and Ganta form an immediate bond, which deepens as they work together to revive the Astronomy Club, driven by their shared need to preserve their newfound sanctuary.The anime boasts impeccable pacing, skillfully depicting the protagonists' isolation due to insomnia and the subtle solace they find in each other. While romance is a central theme, the series prioritises developing Ganta and Isaki's friendship before advancing their relationship, emphasising the depth of their connection beyond shared circumstances.Kokoro Connect injects a supernatural twist into a classic love triangle scenario. The story centers around Taichi, Iori, Yui, Yoshifumi, and Himeko, students of the Student Cultural Research Club, whose lives take a turn when they receive supernatural abilities from a mysterious being named Heartseed.As they grapple with these newfound powers, the group experiences sensory phenomena that challenge their relationships and reveal hidden aspects of their personalities. The anime is rich in character development, providing an engaging and thought-provoking experience.Maid Sama! carries many tropes that might derail other romance anime: an overly perfect male lead, a strong female protagonist reduced to a damsel, and an unnecessary love triangle. Despite these shortcomings, Maid Sama! shines through its strong personality.The heart of Maid Sama! lies in the relationship between Takumi Usui, a charming heartthrob, and Misaki Ayuzawa, a strict student council president with a busy schedule balancing school, home, and work. When Takumi discovers Misaki's secret job at a maid cafe, it opens a new perspective on the usually composed president.In ""Rascal Does Not Dream Of Bunny Girl Senpai,"" romance plays a subtle yet compelling role that defines the series. The story centers on Sakuta Azusagawa, a high school student drawn to girls suffering from Adolescence Syndrome, a condition linked to their insecurities.While the anime unfolds through different arcs focusing on various girls, the standout is the initial saga featuring Mai Sakurajima, an actress who forms a close bond with Sakuta. Their dynamic crackles with romantic tension, warmth, and clever banter. Although not always in the foreground, their relationship develops steadily across subsequent arcs, leading to a satisfying sequel in the form of a feature film.Wakana Gojou and Marin Kitagawa inhabit completely contrasting worlds. Gojou, isolated and reserved, keeps himself apart from others due to his passion for hina dolls, fearing ridicule. In contrast, Kitagawa is popular, outgoing, and self-assured.Despite their differences, Kitagawa becomes intrigued by cosplay and sees Gojou as the ideal person to create outfits for her. ""My Dress-Up Darling"" is a charming, humorous, and beautifully animated romance anime that excels in executing classic genre tropes with finesse.""Toradora!"" is a beloved slice-of-life romantic comedy that offers a wonderful entry point into the genre. The story revolves around Ryuji Yusaku and Taiga Aisaka, two students who have crushes on each other's best friends.Both Ryuji and Taiga are viewed as outcasts—Ryuji due to his intimidating appearance and Taiga because of her fiery temper. They team up to assist each other in their romantic pursuits. The series delves into their evolving dynamic and the humorous mishaps that ensue as they navigate their intertwined love lives.""The Pet Girl of Sakurasou"" depicts the journey of an eccentric group of characters as they navigate growth and self-discovery. Sorata Kanda is forced to move into the unconventional Sakura House after being kicked out of his school's main dorms.In Sakura House, Sorata encounters talented yet troubled students. When a peculiar young artist joins the dorm, Sorata takes on the responsibility of helping her adjust to her new life. The series delves into the interactions among the dorm mates, their personal aspirations, and the interconnected nature of their relationships.""Ouran High School Host Club"" is a delightful reverse harem anime filled with lighthearted and meaningful moments. Haruhi Fujioka accidentally breaks an antique vase belonging to her school's Host Club and must repay her debt by disguising herself as a boy and working as a host.The series excels in developing Haruhi's character along with her fellow hosts, providing insight into their motivations and personalities. It's a must-watch for shojo fans, featuring a memorable cast of characters that carries the show through its run.Kyoto Animation has produced many beloved anime, and ""Love, Chunibyo & Other Delusions!"" is among them. The series centers around a phenomenon known as Chunibyo, where adolescents have grandiose and unrealistic delusions.Yuta Togashi, who has outgrown his delusional phase, aims for a normal high school life. However, things take a turn when his classmate, Rikka Takanashi, reminds him of his past and tries to pull him back into the world of Chunibyo with her own delusions. The series delves into their relationship as Yuta unravels the triggers behind Rikka's delusions.The trope of opposites attracting may be overused, but when done well, it can lead to a captivating romantic comedy. ""Kimi ni Todoke"" explores the endearing friendship between the shy Sawako Kuronuma and the popular Shouta Kazehaya. Sawako, often mistaken for Sadako from ""The Ring,"" is isolated at school due to her appearance, making it challenging for her to break out of her shell. Fortunately, Kazehaya is just the right person to help her.""Kimi ni Todoke"" is a delightful and heartwarming anime with well-developed characters who evolve as the story unfolds. While it adheres to typical romance anime pacing, the journey remains engaging and enjoyable.Unlike most romance stories that focus on the process of falling in love, ""Tonikawa: Over The Moon For You"" follows a married couple who have already reached that point. As a result, the anime adopts a slice-of-life approach, showcasing Nasa and Tsukasa's daily life and antics rather than a typical romantic journey. ""Tonikawa"" doesn't rely on dramatic highs but instead offers a pleasant and light-hearted experience.While this anime may not appeal to everyone, it serves as a refreshing departure from more melodramatic romance shows. Despite their tendency to blush at the slightest physical contact, Nasa and Tsukasa are refreshingly direct in expressing their feelings, making them both witty and likeable characters.This romantic anime shines because of its main character, Takeo Gouda. His towering, imposing presence contrasts beautifully with his heartfelt affection for the delicate Rinko, which is truly heartwarming. Takeo's efforts to play matchmaker for Rinko with his best friend, despite his own feelings, demonstrate his genuine kindness.Viewers will undoubtedly root for Takeo and Rinko's endearing relationship. ""My Love Story!!"" delivers the goods without delay, as the main characters are dating for most of the episodes, bypassing the typical slow build-up to a confession.""A Sign of Affection"" is a heartwarming romantic comedy centred on college-age love and the challenges of communication. While not the sole focus of the story, Yuki and Itsuomi stand out as the main couple, instantly captivating viewers. Yuki, who is hearing-impaired, communicates using sign language, text, and by reading lips, while Itsuomi is a world traveller passionate about learning languages. Their connection begins on a train and grows stronger with each subsequent encounter.The anime beautifully captures the intense emotions of falling in love, highlighted by a poignant moment in the opening episode. With an older cast, ""A Sign of Affection"" takes on a more mature tone compared to typical romance anime. Throughout the season, Yuki and Itsuomi become increasingly comfortable around each other, resulting in consistently endearing interactions.This romantic anime is ideal for LGBTQ+ viewers seeking representation on screen, but its well-crafted storytelling makes it enjoyable for all audiences. The heartwarming romance blossoms between Mafuyu and Ritsuka as Mafuyu learns to play guitar and sing in Ritsuka's band.Watching Mafuyu's growing confidence alongside the romantic tension creates a compelling series that's hard to resist. The accompanying movie is also outstanding and a must-watch continuation of the series.Nana is one of the most renowned and beloved shoujo anime of all time, a must-watch for fans of romance and beyond. The series follows two women named Nana, seemingly different but navigating curiously similar life situations that lead to separate outcomes.Without giving away how their stories intertwine, Nana's 47 episodes delve into the protagonists' perspectives on love through various relationships. Grounded in reality, the anime explores complex characters who, despite occasional extremes, face accountability for their actions.Your Lie in April, one of the most famous romance anime, revolves around two music prodigies: Kousei Arima and Kaori Miyazono. Kousei, grappling with depression after his mother's death, loses his passion for the piano and withdraws from the performance arts. One day, he hears Kaori playing her violin with such freedom that it reignites his love for music and sparks his admiration for her.The anime delves into themes of grief, life, love, and music. Kousei's journey toward self-healing is profound, marked by heartbreak, but also punctuated by moments of beauty, tenderness, and joy.In this anime, Miyuki and Kaguya engage in a battle of wits to avoid confessing their love first, using their intellect and skills to outmaneuver each other. Both are determined not to be seen as the one who gives in.Their antics running the student council at an elite school with their friends are uproariously funny yet also contain heartwarming moments that will make viewers cheer. Season 3 of Kaguya-sama: Love is War, which aired in Spring 2022, leaned heavily into comedy but also devoted more time to developing Miyuki and Kaguya's relationship and touching on other romances.If the anime follows the manga, the next season of Love is War promises to be predominantly romantic. If successful, this upcoming release could elevate Kaguya-sama to the pinnacle of romance anime.This anime consists of two parts: Clannad and After Story. The latter surpasses the former by a wide margin, but watching Clannad is essential to fully appreciate the impact of After Story. While it features a diverse cast of supporting characters, the heart of the show revolves around Tomoya Okazaki and Nagisa Furukawa, delivering a profound narrative.Unlike typical romance series, Clannad After Story unfolds beyond high school, depicting the growth of Tomoya and Nagisa as individuals and as a couple. The anime tackles real-life challenges without glossing over them, offering a genuine exploration of common struggles.The Dangers in My Heart is truly brilliant. At first glance, it may seem like another typical shounen romance where a popular girl falls for an ordinary loner guy. These stories often offer little beyond wish fulfilment, and The Dangers in My Heart initially appears to fit that mould. Yet, the anime stands out.Ichikawa is an average guy with few friends who daydreams about unusual things. While the anime doesn't delve deeply into these thoughts, it doesn't ignore them either, leaving Ichikawa with a poor first impression. On the other hand, Anna is a cheerful but shy girl who loves food and works as a model. After a chance encounter at the school library, the two start spending time together, developing a friendship that hints at something deeper. Anna encourages Ichikawa to break out of his shell, leading to significant changes in him over the course of two seasons.Although slow-paced initially, The Dangers in My Heart evolves into something special by the end of season 1, maintaining its momentum in the subsequent cour and establishing itself as one of the best romance anime of all time. Anna and Ichikawa are both exceptional characters, but Anna's depth is what elevates the show. She's not just an idealised plot device; she's a fully realised character with insecurities, quirks, and vulnerabilities. Her interest in Ichikawa feels genuine, and vice versa. This is a rare quality in romance anime.Fruits Basket is the definitive romance anime, masterfully blending drama and comedy. Tooru Honda, a lovable protagonist, faces life's challenges until she moves in with the Souma family. The Soumas, particularly Yuki, are school idols hiding a shocking secret that alters perceptions.Love triangles often lack depth, favouring one partner over the other. Fruits Basket defies this norm with its compelling love triangle, where each character is fully developed. Across three seasons, Fruits Basket takes viewers on an unforgettable journey.Also read | 15 best anime series of all time; here's the list","Japanese animation has delivered numerous romantic tales, ranging from light- hearted comedies to deeply emotional dramas.

Online gaming app scam 'E-Nugget': ED freezes Rs 90 crore in 70 accounts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/online-gaming-app-scam-e-nugget-ed-freezes-rs-90-crore-in-70-accounts/articleshow/109752608.cms,"In Kolkata, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) recently carried out a crackdown on a suspected online gaming fraud named "" E-Nugget ."" The application, posing as a gaming platform, purportedly enticed users with the prospect of significant investment gains. The ED claims that the app abruptly halted its operations, leaving users unable to withdraw their funds.The Enforcement Directorate started its investigation in 2022 following the discovery of evidence indicating that some of the acquired funds were invested in digital assets.Approximately 2,500 bank accounts associated with the operation were identified, and searches led to the seizure of around Rs 19 crore.Claims suggest that the E-Nugget app, disguised as a gaming platform, assured users of significant returns on their investments. The Enforcement Directorate (ED) launched its investigation following a police report filed by the Kolkata police concerning suspected illegal activities involving Aamir Khan and his associates. They stand accused of deceiving users of the E-Nuggets app with enticing returns before abruptly terminating the scheme. In the course of the operation, the ED seized ₹2.43 crore from 66 bank accounts under the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).Aamir Khan, identified as a central figure in the alleged scam, has been arrested and is currently in custody.

"This techie is the world’s richest prisoner, with a net worth of $43 billion",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/this-techie-is-the-worlds-richest-prisoner-with-a-net-worth-of-43-billion/articleshow/109753350.cms,"The founder and former CEO of the world’s largest

cryptocurrency exchange

,

Binance

,

Changpeng Zhao

has been sentenced to four months in prison. According to a report by Bloomberg, he has been sentenced for failing to prevent cybercriminals and terrorist groups from trading freely on Binance.

Last year, Zhao even pleaded guilty to violations of US anti-money laundering and sanctions laws.

With this sentence, Zhao becomes the richest person to be imprisoned (in the US and perhaps even the world), and the second major crypto boss to be sentenced to prison after

FTX

’s

Sam Bankman-Fried

.

The report suggests that, unlike Bankman-Fried, Zhao’s assets worth $43 billion will remain untouched even with the sentence.

Moreover, the ongoing crypto bull run is expected to increase his net worth even more while he is jailed.

In 2023, Zhao stepped down as the CEO of Binance but still retains an estimated 90% stake in the world’s largest crypto exchange. Considering that the board of directors mostly comprises his close friends, Zhao’s influence on the company is still intact, the report noted.

How Zhao’s sentence is different from Sam Bankman-Fried

The sentence imposed by

US District Judge Richard Jones

in Seattle is relatively shorter than the three years requested by the prosecutors.

His sentence was also much below the maximum 1-1/2 years recommended under federal guidelines.

To compare, Zhao’s sentence was also much lighter than the 25 years of captivity that was imposed on Sam Bankman-Fried in March. Bankman-Fried was accused of stealing $8 billion from customers of the FTX crypto exchange which is now bankrupt. However, Bankman-Fried has appealed his conviction and sentence.

Moreover, prosecutors also seemed happy with the sentence which was the outcome of a long investigation spanning years into Binance and Zhao.

The billionaire also lived in the United Arab Emirates which is beyond US reach.

“This was an epic day. Incarceration was critical in this case and we’re pleased with the result,” said US Attorney

Tessa Gorman

, as per news agency Reuters.","Changpeng Zhao has been sentenced to four months in prison for failing to prevent cybercriminals and terrorist groups from trading freely on Binance.

Display and design: The iPhone 15 features a 6.1-inch display and was launched in pink, yellow, green, blue, and black colour options.

Camera upgrades: This model boasts a 48-megapixel primary camera sensor, offering significant improvements in daylight, low-light, and portrait photography compared to its predecessor.

Battery life: Apple claims the iPhone 15 has ""all-day battery life,"" though real-world usage suggests it can last over 9 hours with average usage.

Processor: Powered by Apple's A16 Bionic chip, an upgrade from the A15 chip used in the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus, with Pro models receiving the faster A16 chip.

Charging port: Notably, the iPhone 15 features a USB Type-C charging port, replacing the Lightning port used in previous models and aligning with the more commonly used USB Type-C standard.
