Apple is shutting down this payment service,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-is-shutting-down-this-payment-service/articleshow/111072592.cms,"Here’s what Apple said

Apple is shutting down its Pay Later service, reports 9to5Mac. It's been less than a year since the service was officially launched, and Apple has already announced its discontinuation.To recall, Apple Pay Later was officially rolled out in the US in October last year. Applicable on purchases made between $75 and $100, the service allowed Apple users to break down a purchase into four equal payments.As per an Apple support document, the company has stopped offering new loans under the Pay Later service. However, the existing Apple Pay Later loans remain unaffected.Starting later this year, users across the globe will be able to access installment loans offered through credit and debit cards, as well as lenders, when checking out with Apple Pay. With the introduction of this new global installment loan offering, we will no longer offer Apple Pay Later in the U.S. Our focus continues to be on providing our users with access to easy, secure and private payment options with Apple Pay, and this solution will enable us to bring flexible payments to more users, in more places across the globe, in collaboration with Apple Pay enabled banks and lenders.Apple users in India will not be affected by this development. This is because Apple Pay Later service was only available in the US. It never made its way to other global markets including the Indian market.In other news, Apple is rumored to be working on a slimmer version of iPhone, possibly in the iPhone 17 series. Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman suggests that the company may introduce its slimmest-ever iPhone in 2025.","Apple Pay Later was officially rolled out in the US in October last year.

watchOS 11 brings automatic nap detection feature to Apple Watch,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/watchos-11-brings-automatic-nap-detection-feature-to-apple-watch/articleshow/111072213.cms,"Apple recently showcased the latest version of its watchOS operating system — watchOS 11 at WWDC 2024 . Apple claims that the new watchOS 11 comes with features built on the company's sensor technology, advanced algorithms, and science-based approach. Now a new online report suggests that Apple has finally introduced the automatic nap detection feature with watchOS 11.

As reported by MacRumours, the watchOS 11 update eliminates the need to manually activate sleep mode. Previously, Apple Watch sleep tracking only functioned when users enabled sleep mode. This meant afternoon naps often went unrecorded, leaving users with an incomplete picture of their overall sleep health. The new automatic nap detection in watchOS 11 aims to bridge this gap.

As per the report, watchOS 11 leverages the watch's built-in motion sensors and sleep detection algorithms to identify naps. This allows users to see their nap duration and quality within the Health app 's sleep section, providing valuable insights into their overall sleep patterns.

While details are still emerging, automatic nap detection appears to function seamlessly. Users don't need to take any specific actions – simply take your nap, and the watch will handle the rest. This passive approach makes it incredibly user-friendly and aligns with the Apple Watch's focus on convenience.

The Cupertino-based tech giant has also confirmed that watchOS 11 will be available this fall as a free software update for Apple Watch Series 6 or later paired with iPhone Xs or later, running iOS 18 .

"Google’s AI model can generate music, dialogues for videos: How it works",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/googles-ai-model-can-generate-music-dialogues-for-videos-how-it-works/articleshow/111066778.cms,"How Google’s V2A AI model works

Limitations of the AI model

Google DeepMind researchers have developed an AI-powered model, called video-to-audio (V2A), that can generate audio and dialogues for videos. This development is a significant step towards creating fully audiovisual experiences using AI.The video-to-audio (V2A) AI tech can work well with videos that are generated by AI models, such as Google’s Veo that was announced at Google I/O 2024. The V2A technology works by combining video information with text prompts.Users can provide additional instructions to guide the V2A system towards specific sounds they want to create for a video, thus, allowing for creative control over the generated soundtrack.“Today, we're sharing progress on our video-to-audio (V2A) technology, which makes synchronised audiovisual generation possible. V2A combines video pixels with natural language text prompts to generate rich soundscapes for the on-screen action,” the company said.“Our V2A technology is pairable with video generation models like Veo to create shots with a dramatic score, realistic sound effects or dialogue that matches the characters and tone of a video,” it added.V2A first encodes the video and then uses a diffusion model to refine random noise into realistic audio that matches the video and any text prompts provided. Finally, the audio is decoded and combined with the video data.Some of the use cases include generating soundtracks for silent videos or traditional footage, including archival materials and silent films.“To generate higher quality audio and add the ability to guide the model towards generating specific sounds, we added more information to the training process, including AI-generated annotations with detailed descriptions of sound and transcripts of spoken dialogue,” Google DeepMind said.The AI model is trained on video, audio and the additional annotations which is said to help it associate specific audio events with various visual scenes, at the same time, responding to the information provided in transcripts.As per the researchers, the quality of the generated audio depends on the quality of the video input and lip movements in videos generated by other models might not perfectly match the soundtrack created by V2A.","Google DeepMind researchers have developed an AI-powered model, called video-to- audio (V2A), that can generate audio and dialogues for videos.

This advisory highlights multiple vulnerabilities that could potentially allow attackers to compromise targeted systems.CERT-In, operating under the Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology, emphasised that these vulnerabilities affect Microsoft Edge Stable versions prior to 126.0.2592.56. The agency strongly recommends users update their browsers to mitigate these risks.The vulnerabilities stem from several issues within the browser, including use-after-free flaws in PDFium, Audio, Browser UI, V8, and Dawn components; heap buffer overflows in the Tab Strip and Tab Groups; inappropriate implementations in Downloads, Memory Allocator, DevTools, and Dawn; a policy bypass in CORS; and type confusion in V8. Attackers could exploit these weaknesses by persuading users to visit maliciously crafted webpages, leading to potential system compromises.CERT-In's advisory explains that successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow attackers to gain control of the targeted system, posing significant security threats. The agency advises users to apply the latest security updates provided by Microsoft to protect their systems from these potential attacks.This warning from CERT-In comes shortly after similar advisories were issued regarding vulnerabilities in other widely used platforms, including Android and Google Chrome for Desktop.

Apple co-founder Steve Jobs on how his father helped him develop the skill he is known most for,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-co-founder-steve-jobs-on-how-his-father-helped-him-develop-the-skill-he-is-known-most-for/articleshow/111064483.cms,"Steve Jobs' attention to details while launching first iPhone

Apple co-founder Steve Jobs is known for a relentless pursuit of quality. Jobs' meticulous attention to detail -- which is also a hallmark of Apple products -- can be traced back to a lesson from his father. According to Walter Isaacson -- who wrote Jobs' biography -- the former CEO of Apple learned this lesson while building a fence.“You’ve got to make the back of the fence, that nobody will see, just as good looking as the front of the fence,” Walter Isaacson recounted Paul (Steve Jobs father) telling him, “Even though nobody will see it, you will know, and that will show that you’re dedicated to making something perfect.”Jobs told Walter Isaacson about his father, “He loved doing things right.”According to Isaacson, Steve Jobs' meticulous attention to detail extended to even the unseen aspects of Apple products. Isaacson highlights Jobs' insistence on the aesthetics of microchip interiors and the use of ""expensive plating"" on every screw.“When you’re a carpenter making a beautiful chest of drawers, you’re not going to use a piece of plywood on the back, even though it faces the wall,"" Steve Jobs said on what he learnt from his father.Jobs' dedication to detail was evident in the launch of the first iPhone . While competitors largely focused on features, Jobs oversaw every aspect of the user experience and talked about how the rounded corners of the iPhone was the result of months of refinement to feel comfortable in the hand.He also highlighted that the user interface underwent countless iterations to ensure a clean and intuitive layout. The launch presentation itself was designed so well that Jobs demonstrated features with ease. The result was a product that was not only feature-rich but one that felt well-designed and pleasure to use.","Steve Jobs' meticulous attention to detail can be traced back to a lesson from his father.

How missile engineer Nishant was arrested

Former BrahMos scientist Nishant Agrawal was sentenced to life by a sessions court earlier this for leaking military secrets to Pakistan. Nishant worked in the missile assembly unit at Nagpur. An award-winning missile engineer, Nishant was convicted by the sessions court under Section 235 of Criminal Procedure Code. He was found guilty of offences punishable under Section 66(f) of the IT Act and various sections of the Official Secrets Act (OSA) for leaking critical information about armaments to foreign powers.Pankaj Awasthi, UP-ATS investigation officer, said in his deposition during Nishant trial that one 'Sejal' had set up a Facebook account from Pakistan. Using this, she chatted with Pakistani operatives and her Indian targets.The chats showed she was part of a group that shared data and tips on deceiving Indian defence staffers. Awasthi told the court that on Sejal's directions, Agrawal had clicked on links sent by her and installed three apps on his personal laptop in 2017.These three apps were malware that stole data from Nishant's laptop, which contained classified information. Investigations claim that crucial documents related to the BrahMos missile were found on his personal computers, violating BAPL’s security norms.Nishant is said to have chatted with Sejal on Linked-in too, where she reportedly showed interest in hiring him, posing as a recruiter in UK's Hays Aviation.Nisnant was arrested in October 2018 through a joint operation by Military Intelligence (MI) and the Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) of Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra.

Unusual battery drain: A sudden and significant decrease in battery life can indicate that malicious software is running in the background, consuming power.

Overheating: While some heating is normal during heavy usage, consistent overheating can be a sign of malware or spyware running on your device.

Increased data usage: Unexpected spikes in data usage may indicate that your phone is sending information to a third party without your knowledge.

Strange activity: If you notice unusual activities such as apps opening on their own, text messages you didn't send, or calls you didn't make, your phone might be compromised.

Pop-ups and ads: An influx of pop-up ads, especially when not using a browser, can be a sign of adware infection.

Unrecognised apps: If you find apps installed that you don't remember downloading, it could be a sign of unauthorised access.

Slow performance: A sudden drop in your phone's performance speed can be a result of malware hogging resources.

Unusual charges on your bill: Unexpected charges for premium services or international calls might indicate that a hacker is exploiting your phone.

Immediate actions to take if your phone is hacked

Disconnect from the internet: The first step is to disconnect your phone from the internet to stop any data transfer. Turn off Wi-Fi and mobile data immediately.

Enable aeroplane mode: Switch your phone to aeroplane mode to cut off all communication signals, preventing further access by the hacker.

Check and remove suspicious apps: Go through your installed apps and delete any that seem suspicious or that you don’t remember installing.

Change passwords: Using another device, change the passwords for all your important accounts, including email, social media, and banking apps. Ensure that the new passwords are strong and unique.

Install and run security software: Install reputable mobile security software and run a full scan to detect and remove any malware or spyware.

Update your phone’s OS and apps: Ensure your phone’s operating system and apps are up-to-date. Updates often include security patches that fix vulnerabilities.

Factory reset: If the problem persists, consider performing a factory reset. This will erase all data and settings, returning your phone to its original state. Make sure to back up important data before doing this.

Contact your service provider: Inform your mobile service provider about the issue. They can provide assistance and may have additional security measures to help protect your account.

Monitor your accounts: Keep a close eye on your bank and other important accounts for any suspicious activity and report it immediately.

Preventative measures

Use strong, unique passwords: Ensure all your accounts are protected with strong, unique passwords. Consider using a password manager.

Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): Add an extra layer of security by enabling two-factor authentication on your accounts.

Be cautious with downloads: Only download apps from reputable sources like the official app stores and avoid clicking on suspicious links.

Regularly update your device: Keep your phone’s operating system and apps updated to protect against known vulnerabilities.

Install security software: Use mobile security software to protect against malware, spyware, and other threats.

Avoid public Wi-Fi: Public Wi-Fi networks can be insecure. Use a VPN if you need to access sensitive information over public Wi-Fi.

Google rolls out Pixel Camera 9.4 update with Pro lens selection and improved HDR+,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/mobiles-tabs/google-rolls-out-pixel-camera-9-4-update-with-pro-lens-selection-and-improved-hdr/articleshow/111060782.cms,"Google has begun releasing a significant update to its Pixel Camera app, bringing new features and enhancements to several Pixel smartphone models . Version 9.4 of the app, which is currently rolling out via the Google Play Store, adds a Pro Lens selection mode and improves the HDR+ functionality on supported Pixel phones like the Pixel 6 Pro, Pixel 7 Pro, Pixel 8 Pro and Pixel Fold.One of the key additions in Pixel Camera 9.4 is the new Pro Lens selection feature. This allows users to manually choose between the ultra-wide, wide, and telephoto lenses on their device when taking a photo, rather than relying on the camera app to automatically select the appropriate lens. The Pro Lens option can be found under a new ""Pro"" tab in the camera settings.The update also brings improvements to HDR+ ( High Dynamic Range Plus ), Google's computational photography technology that combines multiple exposures to create images with better detail and dynamic range. Pixel Camera 9.4 enhances HDR+ with smarter automatic frame selection, favouring shots where subjects have their eyes open and are smiling.Additionally, the placement of the RAW/JPEG toggle has been moved from an obscure location in the settings to the more easily accessible Pro tab. However, unlike the Pixel 8 Pro, there is no option to adjust the image resolution.While the new version of Pixel Camera is currently available for download, users may not see the new features immediately after installing the update. The additional functionality is expected to be enabled via a server-side update from Google or with the release of the June Pixel Feature Drop .","Google has begun rolling out version 9.4 of its Pixel Camera app. It adds a Pro Lens selection mode and improves the HDR+ functionality on supported Pixel phones.

Former IT minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar expressed concerns about the integrity of datasets used in training most artificial intelligence (AI) models, highlighting that their low quality compromise the quality of the resulting applications.He noted that the subpar design of these datasets is the reason why large language models’ ( LLMs ) return ""bullshit content"".“LLMs ‘bullshit content’ comes from most models being trained on content/datasets that are – to politely use the phrase - NOT quality assured. That’s why you have the embarrassing sight of billion dollar Gemini/ChatGPT many occasions spewing nonsense,” said Chandrasekhar.“Garbage in, Garbage out is an old adage in programming espclly if ur depending on scraping the internet,” he added.Chandrasekhar was reacting to Ethan Mollick, Associate Professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in the US, who posted that the idea that “LLMs bullshit - produce content without regard to truth - is not new”.“But I don't think it is that helpful a framework, since, in the end, LLMs may be more accurate than humans in many tasks,” the professor noted.Large language models, often abbreviated as LLMs, are the underlying technology that give AI chatbots their conversational abilities.LLMs are trained on huge amounts of text data, like books, articles and even code. This data can be vast, containing trillions of words – far more than any human may ever read. LLMs analyse this data and understand how language works, including the relationships between words and how they're used in different contexts.They rely on complex algorithms called neural networks – brains of AI models – mimicking how the human brain processes information. By making connections between different pieces of text data, the LLM learns to identify patterns and predict what words are likely to come next. They are then infused in interfaces called chatbots.Read Also | Bill Gates podcast with Nikhil Kamath: India’s ‘contribution’ to Microsoft’s success, CEO Satya Nadella and more","Former IT minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar expressed concerns about the integrity of datasets used in training most artificial intelligence (AI) models.

He noted, ""It was during that time that I was kind of learning, “Oh wow, India is such a study in contrast, first class in so many ways, but still a lot of poverty and challenges.""Gates further delved into the differences between the legal systems in India and the United States. He pointed out that legal practices in the US might not be directly applicable in India.

A US District Court has fined Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) a total of $194.2 million (about Rs 1,600 crore) on charges of alleged misappropriation of trade secrets. The order against TCS has been passed in a case filed by Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC), which has merged with DXC Technology Company (DXC), alleging misappropriation of its trade secrets before United States district court.TCS informed the court order to the Stock Exchange Board of India (SEBI) in a BSE filing. It added it will appeal against the court order and file a review petition. ""Pursuant to Regulation 30 of SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, we hereby inform you that the Company has received an adverse judgement passed by United States District Court, Northern District of Texas, Dallas Division, details of which are provided in Annexure A.""Giving details about the lawsuit filed by CSC, the BSE filing says, ""In a suit filed by Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC)/DXC Technology Company (DXC) against the Company, alleging misappropriation of its trade secrets:* The Court ordered that the Company is liable to CSC for $56,151,583 in compensatory damages and $ 112,303,166 in exemplary damages.• The Court also assessed that the Company is liable for $25,773,576.60 in prejudgment interest through June 13, 2024.• The Court also passed certain injunctions and other reliefs against the Company.“The court ordered that the company is liable to CSC for $56,151,583 in compensatory damages and $112,303,166 in exemplary damages,” the Mumbai-basedsoftware services company said in a regulatory filing.Responding to the court ruling, the Tata group company said that the judgement won’t have any major adverse impact on its financials and operations.

TCS had secured a $2 billion contract with Transamerica the previous year. The suit accused TCS of exploiting the software access granted to 2,200 Transamerica employees, who were transferred to TCS, to learn about CSC’s software internals and create a rival insurance platform. The court found that TCS had improperly accessed and used confidential data from DXC’s insurance management software, resulting in a $70 million penalty for trade secret misappropriation and an additional $140 million for deliberate infringement.Furthermore, Transamerica terminated its decade-long agreement with TCS prematurely in June 2023.

Steven Spielberg startled by Apple Watch’s false alarm: Here’s what happened,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/steven-spielberg-startled-by-apple-watchs-false-alarm-heres-what-happened/articleshow/111052524.cms,"What exactly happened

What is Apple Watch’s fall detection feature

Legendary director Steven Spielberg had a moment of onstage surprise during a recent Tribeca Film Festival talk. According to a report by Variety, his Apple Watch abruptly displayed a warning about a potential hard fall, causing a brief disruption.The incident occurred while Spielberg was discussing his early films. The Apple Watch's fall detection feature, designed to initiate emergency services after a tumble, mistakenly interpreted a movement as a fall. Spielberg, likely startled by the unexpected alert, reportedly removed the watch from his wrist.Unfortunately, this reaction triggered another failsafe. With no response from Spielberg to the on-screen prompt, the Apple Watch initiated an audible countdown before attempting an emergency call. However, Spielberg realised the situation and quickly silenced the alert before any unnecessary dispatch of emergency personnel.While such false alarms are uncommon with Apple Watches, they can occur at inconvenient times. The episode highlights the potential for these safety features to cause momentary confusion, especially when users are unaware of the proper response protocol.In this case, a simple press of the ""X"" on the watch screen would have dismissed the fall warning.Apple Watch's fall detection feature is designed to identify when you've taken a hard fall and potentially connect you with emergency services.“If Apple Watch SE, Apple Watch Series 4 or later, or Apple Watch Ultra or later detects a hard fall while you’re wearing your watch, it will tap you on the wrist, sound an alarm and display an alert. You can choose to contact the emergency services, or dismiss the alert by pressing the Digital Crown, tapping Close in the top left-hand corner or tapping “I'm OK”, said the company.","Apple Watch's fall detection feature is designed to identify when you've taken a hard fall and potentially connect you with emergency services.

However, new reports claim that it will arrive in 2025 with the iPhone 17 series.Mark Gurman , in its latest Power On newsletter, has revealed that Apple will be making an iPhone 17 with a slimmer overall chassis and this will be the thinnest-ever iPhone along with a slimmer version of MacBook Pro and Apple Watch.Apple plans to go “Slim” in 2025Based on the report, Apple is reportedly planning to go slim with almost every product it offers.
