What is Microsoft’s 25-year-old case

In a landmark decision, a US federal court has ruled that Google abused its dominant position in the search and advertising markets. The tech giant was found guilty of anti-competitive practices aimed at maintaining its monopoly. In the ruling, Judge Amit Mehta court drew parallels between Google's actions and Microsoft 's past antitrust case, highlighting similar tactics to stifle competition.“The end result here is not dissimilar from the Microsoft court’s conclusion as to the browser market,” Mehta wrote in his 300-page ruling.For those unversed, in 1999, Microsoft faced a significant antitrust lawsuit alleging that the company had abused its dominant position in the operating system market. A federal judge ruled that Microsoft had illegally used the power of its Windows operating system to suppress competition from rival browsers, particularly Netscape Navigator.As a result of the legal battle, in 2001, Microsoft was forced to modify its business practices and allow for greater competition in the browser market“Just as the agreements in that case help[ed] keep usage of [Netscape] Navigator below the critical level necessary for Navigator or any other rival to pose a real threat to Microsoft’s monopoly, Google’s distribution agreements have constrained the query volumes of its rivals, thereby inoculating Google against any genuine competitive threat,” Mehta wrote.Similar to Microsoft, Google has been found guilty of anti-competitive practices aimed at maintaining its monopoly. The judge said that Google's exclusive deals with device manufacturers and browsers to make its search engine the default were cited as key factors contributing to its market dominance.The judge noted that one key similarity is the “power of the default.” Google struck deals with mobile phone makers, including Apple, that cost the company billions of dollars a year in payouts.“Users are free to navigate to Google’s rivals through non-default search access points, but they rarely do,” Mehta wrote. Google’s landmark case was filed by the government in 2020.","A US federal court has ruled that Google abused its dominant position in the search and advertising markets.

CCI seeks Apple's response on App Store antitrust investigation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/cci-seeks-apples-response-on-app-store-antitrust-investigation/articleshow/112362114.cms,"

What CCI found in investigation against Apple’s App Store policies

The Competition Commission of India ( CCI ) has sought a response from Apple into an investigation pertaining to App Store policies, a report has said. The antitrust watchdog has shared its preliminary findings with the tech giant, alleging that Apple's practices violate fair trade norms.Citing a person aware of the details, a report by The Economic Times said that the non-classified part of the CCI director general's investigation report has been sent to Apple for its reply and after the iPhone maker’s response before it reaches a final decision.The entire process, including potential hearings, is expected to take several months, the report added.A TOI report said that the CCI's investigation, initiated in late 2021, focused on Apple's mandatory in-app purchase system and other restrictive policies that developers claim limit competition and consumer choice.“...it can be concluded that by virtue of its dominant position in the market for app stores for iOS in India, Apple engaged in abusive conduct and practices in violation of Section 3(4) and Section 4 of the Competition Act,” a supplementary probe report by CCI's investigation arm said, as per TOI.“... investigation is of the opinion that Apple has entered into anti-competitive agreements with app developers which have the effect of causing 'appreciable adverse effect on competition' in the market,” sources said.The CCI also found that Apple's App Store an “unavoidable trading partner” for app developers who have “no choice but to adhere to Apple's unfair terms, including the mandatory use of Apple's proprietary billing and payment system.”“Apple imposes several onerous conditions via developer program licence agreement (DPLA) and App Store review guidelines. The anti-steering provisions restrict the app developers from communicating alternative purchase methods within the app. Accordingly, no third-party payment processor is permitted to provide services for the digital content on iOS devices,” sources told TOI.This development marks a crucial stage in the CCI's probe into Apple's business practices. A similar investigation was carried out against Google.","The Competition Commission of India ( CCI ) has sought a response from Apple into an investigation pertaining to App Store policies.

Previous job cuts at Intel

Intel recently announced to reduce its head count by more than 15% of its workforce, some 15,000 people, to reduce costs. In a latest, Intel shareholders have now sued the chipmaker. The shareholders claim that the company's materially false or misleading statements about the business and its manufacturing capabilities inflated its stock price from January 25 to August 1, a Reuters report says.Intel's share price tumbled 26% to $21.48 on Aug.2, the day after it announced quarterly results, the job cuts and the dividend suspension.As per the report, the proposed class action against Intel, Chief Executive Patrick Gelsinger and Chief Financial Officer David Zinsner was filed in San Francisco federal court.The Reuters report states that Intel shareholders alleges that the company fraudulently concealed problems that resulted in job cuts, dividend suspension and weak results.“Shareholders said they were blindsided when Intel revealed on Aug. 1 that its so-called foundry business for making chips on contract for outsiders was in their words ""floundering,"" costing billions of dollars extra even as revenue declined,” the report mentions.Intel had previously announced job cuts in October 2022. It reduced its workforce by about 5% in 2023. The company expected those cost reductions would save as much as $10 billion by 2025.Earlier this year, Intel laid off approximately 62 employees at its headquarters in Santa Clara, California. The workforce reduction was then led by Christoph Schell in the Sales and Marketing Group.Despite being a major player in the personal computer and server markets, Intel has struggled to keep pace with the rising demand of artificial intelligence (AI) chips against rivals including Advanced Micro Devices, Nvidia, Samsung Electronics and Taiwan's TSMC.","Intel recently announced to reduce its head count by more than 15% of its workforce, some 15,000 people.

"'$20 billion risk' that Apple faces after Google called ""monopoly""",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/20-billion-risk-that-apple-faces-after-google-called-monopoly/articleshow/112355932.cms,"Is there a way out for Apple and Google

Apple's lucrative deal with Google faces uncertainty after a US judge ruled that the search giant holds an illegal monopoly. To avoid further antitrust action, Google may terminate its agreement making its search engine the default on Apple devices, according to Wall Street analysts.This deal is said to generate $20 billion annually for Apple, roughly 36% of Google's search ad revenue from Safari.A potential breakup could reduce Apple's profits by 4-6%. The contract extends until at least September 2026, with an option for Apple to renew it for two more years.According to media reports earlier this year that cited a document filed by the Department of Justice in the antitrust case, the Apple-Google's iPhone partnership runs until at least September 2026 and Apple has the right to unilaterally extend it for another two years.Possible remedies include ending Google's payment for default placement or requiring Apple to actively prompt users to choose a search engine. Legal challenges could extend the process until 2026.If the partnership ends, Apple may offer alternatives like Microsoft Bing or develop its own search product using OpenAI technology. The ruling accelerates Apple's shift towards AI-powered search, including integrating ChatGPT and developing its Siri. While these AI ventures may initially generate little revenue, they offer long-term growth potential.Apple's move away from exclusive deals aligns with its efforts to avoid regulatory scrutiny. While the Google deal is profitable, the company sees an opportunity to leverage AI for search.","A US judge ruled that the search giant holds an illegal monopoly.

COAI’s member Telecom Service Providers (TSPs) have consistently invested in enhancing Quality of Service (QoS) through significant improvements in network infrastructure, resulting in greater stability and reliability. The industry has embraced advanced technologies and automation tools, including predictive maintenance and AI-driven analytics, to proactively address network issues. Moreover, major initiatives are underway to fiberize towers across India, which is a crucial step for the efficient deployment of 5G services.

While TRAI has tightened the QoS benchmarks over the years, the ground realities remain unchanged. TSPs still grapple with Right of Way (RoW) issues when acquiring permissions for infrastructure deployment in public and private land for the installation of cell towers and fiber-optic cables. The situation is further aggravated due to additional requirement of street furniture for the 5G networks. Moreover, interference from various sources, such as other wireless devices and electromagnetic interference, degrade signal quality and network performance. Further, illegal boosters and repeaters used by unauthorised agents, as well as the cases of theft of equipment are also external factors which, nevertheless, impact the QoS. Besides, frequent takedown of the overhead fiber by the authorities have a significant impact in QoS as well. TSPs have limited control over these external sources which adversely impact the Quality of Services.

Despite these challenges, TSPs have consistently met TRAI's QoS benchmarks. The industry expresses concern over the proposed regulations, which not only tighten benchmarks but also shift from quarterly to monthly reporting and site to cell level reporting in many cases. In fact, the QoS parameters prescribed in the new Regulations have not been introduced by any other regulator in other similar economies. These changes are expected to significantly increase the compliance as well as the cost burden on telecom operators, and without commensurate benefits for the customers.

While we are disappointed with the stringency of these new regulations, we remain committed to engaging constructively with TRAI on QoS-related matters. Our member organizations will continue to strive for excellence in service quality while advocating for regulations that recognize the practical challenges faced by our industry.

What are the new QoS rules

The telecom industry has raised concerns over stringent new quality of service (QoS) norms introduced by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India ( TRAI ). The Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), representing major telecom players -- Reliance Jio , Airtel and Vodafone-Idea -- argues that the regulations impose excessive burdens without addressing the challenges operators face on the ground.The new rules mandate stricter service quality benchmarks, increased penalties for non-compliance, and more frequent reporting requirements. Telecom operators must now compensate subscribers for outages exceeding 24 hours at the district level and face penalties of up to Rs 10 lakh for violations.However, COAI contends that these measures are impractical given ongoing hurdles such as right-of-way (RoW) issues for infrastructure deployment, interference from unauthorized devices, and theft of equipment. The industry body also highlights the impact of frequent fiber cuts and the additional demands of 5G network rollout. Despite these challenges, telecom operators have consistently met Trai's QoS benchmarks , according to COAI. The industry is seeking a more realistic approach that acknowledges the operational difficulties and avoids placing undue financial pressure on operators.Trai has issued new quality of service (QoS) rules, making it mandatory for telecom operators to compensate subscribers in case of service outages for more than 24 hours at a district level. Trai has also increased the penal amount to Rs 1 lakh from Rs 50,000 for failing to meet each quality benchmark under the new rules.The telecom regulator has introduced a graded penalty system of Rs 1 lakh, Rs 2 lakh, Rs 5 lakh and Rs 10 lakh for different scales of rule violations and submitting false report under revised regulations -- ""The Standards of Quality of Service of Access (Wirelines and Wireless) and Broadband (Wireline and Wireless) Service Regulations, 2024"".Trai has provided a six-month grace period for operators to align their systems with the new regulations.","The Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), representing major telecom players -- Reliance Jio, Airtel and Vodafone-Idea -- argues that the regulations impose excessive burdens.

How to identify Amazon OTP scam

Meanwhile, if you are a victim of cybercrime, register your complaint with the National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal at https://cybercrime.gov.in/ or call 1930.

Amazon Great Freedom Festival sale is here and as shoppers flock to the e-commerce platform for shopping, scammers are also gearing up to capitalise on the increased online activity. One common tactic employed by fraudsters is the OTP scam. Numerous individuals have fallen victim to this scheme in the past, prompting Amazon to issue warnings to its customers.Since people usually spend thousands of their hard-earned money, it becomes crucial to remain vigilant and protect personal information during this sale period, especially from scammers requesting sign-in OTP via phone calls.In a communication shared with customers recently, Amazon said that scammers are adopting multiple tactics to defraud unsuspecting shoppers. A growing number of individuals have reported receiving phone calls from individuals posing as Amazon customer service representatives or delivery agents. These scammers aim to steal personal information, including login credentials, by manipulating victims into revealing sensitive data.Scammers often try to create a sense of urgency, stating that there has been an unexpected order or delivery which may not have been placed by a potential victim. The scammers will then ask for a sign-in One-Time Password (OTP) to cancel the delivery.A confused ‘customer’ then shares the OTP thinking that he/ she has averted the hassle of package delivery, however in reality, the scammer has gained access to the account. Shoppers must note that Amazon will never ask its customers to share their account sign-in OTP or passcode, especially over the phone to avoid being scammed.“If you receive communication — a call, text, or email — that you think may not be from Amazon, please report it to us at, amazon.in/reportascam,” it said.Last year, Amazon India and the Uttar Pradesh Police joined hands to fight fraud and protect online shoppers from bad actors. They launched a consumer education and awareness campaign named #MissionGraHAQ.","Amazon Great Freedom Festival sale is here and as shoppers flock to the e-commerce platform for shopping, scammers are gearing up to capitalise on the increased online activity.

Delta Airlines seeks compensation for disruption

In mounting problems for CrowdStrike over Microsoft outage last month, the cybersecurity company being sued by air travellers in a latest move. According to a Reuters report, air travellers whose flights were delayed or cancelled on July 19 due to Microsoft Windows outage on July 19 have filed a class action against the company.The plaintiffs include three fliers who filed the lawsuit in the federal court, Austin, Texas.They blame CrowdStrike's negligence in testing and deploying its software for the outage. Adding further, they stated that as fliers scrambled to get to their destinations, many spent hundreds of dollars on lodging, meals and alternative travel, while others missed work or suffered health problems from having to sleep on the airport floor.The filers demand CrowdStrike to pay compensatory and punitive damages to anyone whose flight was disrupted.In a statement, CrowdStrike said ""We believe this case lacks merit and we will vigorously defend the company."" The US cybersecurity company also provided an identical statement in response to a shareholder lawsuit filed on July 31.Delta claims that it faced over 2,200 flight cancellations on July 19 alone, with more than 6,000 flights cancelled since then. The airline is now dealing with over 176,000 refund or reimbursement requests. The estimated cost of the outages could reach as high as $500 million.The company’s CEO Ed Bastian said last week the outage had cost the airline $500 million, adding that it plans to take legal action to get compensation from the cybersecurity firm.Microsoft outage on July 19 was caused by a faulty software update that impacted 8 million Windows computers worldwide.

This marks the first time the DGGI has issued such a notice to a cryptocurrency firm, setting a significant precedent in India’s efforts to regulate the rapidly growing virtual currency market.Sources confirmed that the notice was issued to Binance for collecting fees from Indian customers trading in virtual digital assets (VDAs) on their platform, categorized under online information database access or retrieval (OIDAR) services.Earlier this year, Binance received approval from India’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) to register as a virtual asset service provider (VASP). However, the company was slapped with a Rs 18 crore penalty from the FIU last month for non-compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) regulations.Despite being a major player in the global cryptocurrency market, with at least 40% market share and operations across more than 150 countries, Binance had not registered under the Indian GST framework. This oversight has now brought the company under the scrutiny of Indian tax authorities.“Binance reportedly earned at least Rs 4,000 crore from transaction fees charged to Indian customers. The company has a user base of 90 million users globally, including a substantial number of customers from India too. Detailed investigation revealed that the earnings of these fees were credited to the account of a Binance Group Company — Nest Services Limited — based in Seychelles,” a top source privy to the development said.In fact, Binance is reportedly facing a trial in a Nigerian court for alleged tax evasion, following a crypto crackdown in the country.To make Binance compliant with the GST regulations, DGGI Ahmedabad zonal unit also sent emails to Binance group companies in Seychelles, the Cayman Islands and Switzerland, which did not elicit a response. Binance appointed a local counsel in India to liaise with the DGGI, marking the first step towards resolving this significant tax compliance issue.Sources confirmed that DGGI is also closely monitoring financial transactions and activities of online gaming platforms and marketplaces for the possibility of tax evasion.The Indian GST regime mandates that foreign service providers pay GST for services provided to Indian residents, particularly under the OIDAR category. As the investigation continues, other cryptocurrency exchanges operating both overseas and within India are also expected to face scrutiny from tax authorities, said sources.","The Ahmedabad zonal unit of the Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGGI) has issued a show cause notice to Binance.

The new offering promises lightning-fast 8-16 minute deliveries for a diverse range of products, spanning from groceries to electronics.With this move, Flipkart directly challenges established players in the booming quick commerce sector, including Swiggy's Instamart, Zomato's Blinkit , Zepto , and BigBasket's BB Now.The service, which was previously offered on a trial basis to employees at Flipkart's headquarters, is now available to users through the Flipkart app.We confirmed the service's availability by checking an address in HSR on the Flipkart app, which indeed showed Flipkart Minutes as an option for quick delivery. Additionally, several users on X (formerly Twitter) reported that Flipkart is delivering groceries and other items to their addresses in Bengaluru within minutes through the ""Minutes"" service.Sources familiar with the matter tell the Economic Times that Flipkart plans to expand the service to more areas in Bengaluru over the next few weeks.The launch of Flipkart Minutes comes at a time when other players in the quick commerce space are aggressively expanding their operations.The ET had earlier reported that Flipkart was planning to operate around 100 dark stores to bolster its quick-commerce offerings during the upcoming festive season. Dark stores, which are mini warehouses strategically located for rapid deliveries, have become a crucial component of quick commerce operations.Blinkit, for instance, recently announced ambitious plans to increase its dark store count to 2,000 by 2026. This doubles down on its earlier announced plans to have 1,000 dark stores by March 2025. Similarly, Zepto aims to double its network to 700 dark stores by March 2025. Swiggy Instamart , another major player, currently operates more than 500 such warehouses.Interestingly, Amazon, a key player in the e-commerce space, has not shown interest in the quick-commerce business in India so far. However, it does operate a grocery store service dubbed "" Amazon Fresh ,"" offering same-day delivery for groceries.

What doctor said

An Apple Watch user is crediting the smartwatch for saving his life after the wearable alerted him about a life-threatening condition. Peter Moore , a resident of Montecito, California shared his experience with a local news publisher KTLA. Narrating the incident, he said “I wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for this little device”.Moore, who is a former tech executive, said that he was on his way to the airport when he began to feel “a little lightheaded and a little faint”.“Like a typical male, I thought, ‘I’ll go to Starbucks. That’ll fix it,'” Moore explained before he received a notification from the Apple Watch he was wearing.“My phone started to ping and said ‘low heart rate,’ which I’d never seen before. And so I looked at it… my heart rate had dropped to 32. And it was insistent in its notifications that something wasn’t right,” said Moore. He then contacted his wife who took him to hospital.“The doctor kind of theatrically ran in and said, ‘This is not good. This is not good. You need a pacemaker right now,'” Moore said.Omid Yousefian, the cardiac electrophysiologist at Sansum Clinic Cardiology who treated Moore said “Yes, his watch had a big role in saving his life”.“These days, 25% of the population over the age of 40 … have a high chance of experiencing atrial fibrillation,” Yousefian explained.“For us physicians, symptoms are the most important thing. [Moore] was notified by his watch that his heart rate is slow and he correlated that with the symptoms that he had. So he didn’t wait. He didn’t sit. He came to the hospital directly. So he made a very smart move,” Yousefian told the publication.","Peter Moore, a former tech executive, was on his way to the airport when he began to feel “a little lightheaded and a little faint” He received a notification from the Apple Watch he was wearing that his heart rate had dropped to 32.

What exactly happened

Read the complete post here

In a shocking incident, a Supreme Court lawyer, Mukul P Unny , was scammed out of Rs 38,000 while attempting to exchange his iPhone 13 for an iPhone 15 on Amazon .in. The lawyer detailed his ordeal on social media, highlighting the fraudulent tactics employed by the delivery executive.Unny took X (formerly known as Twitter) to post about the new kind of smartphone exchange scam.The incident occurred on July 21, 2024, when Unny placed an order for the iPhone 15 on Amazon. The following day, a delivery executive arrived at his residence and handed over the new phone after receiving the necessary OTP. However, the executive then requested another OTP, claiming it was required to complete the exchange.Despite Unny's hesitation, he was convinced to return the new iPhone to the delivery executive after speaking to the latter's supervisor.Unny contacted Amazon customer care the following day to report the incident. Initially, Amazon assured him of a refund if the product was not delivered. However, subsequent inquiries revealed the case was under investigation with a resolution deadline of July 31.On July 31st, Amazon concluded its investigation and informed Unny that a refund was impossible. The company's explanation lacked substance, as they had not thoroughly verified the scam details. The fact that Unny still possessed his old iPhone directly contradicted Amazon's claim that the exchange was complete.While Amazon has eventually issued a refund to Unny, his ordeal underscores the considerable risks inherent in online transactions, even when dealing with reputable platforms like Amazon.Always verify the identity of a delivery executive before sharing your Amazon OTP. This crucial step can protect you from falling victim to scams.“This is the story of my worst experience with @amazonIN On 21.07.2024, I ordered iPhone 15 from Amazon in exchange for my iPhone 13. On 22.07.2024, the delivery executive came at around 930 PM. I gave the OTP and took the product, and gave my phone to the executive.He said I have give another OTP. I had already given the OTP and was wondering what other OTP is to be given for exchange. I said I dont have any other OTP than the one I have given. He stayed there for few minutes & then called his supervisor.After speaking with the supervisor, the delivery exec asked for return of the product since the ""exchange is not final"".I insisted that I speak with the supervisor. The supervisor tells me that the exchange is done by a different team & requests for the product to be returned. I said I cannot give away the product especially since the OTP is given and the app was showing that the product is delivered. But this supervisor Ashok (8076650306) requested me to return, lest his team will have to make for the loss.Upon his request and assurance that the product will be ""reattempted"" the next day, I gave the product to the delivery exec (Vishal 8826421956) after taking the supervisor's and the delivery exec's number. On 23.07.2024, I spoke with the Amazon Customer Care and raised a complaint to which I assured that refund will be initiated if the product is not delivered. Call centre asked me to follow up on 25.07.2024.On 26.07.2024,when I called them, the customer case asked me to wait till 31.05.2024 as ""it has to be investigated"". Today, when I call Amazon, they said ""investigation"" is complete and that refund cannot be initiated. No fact-finding was done by Amazon in this. Now, we are staring at a loss of Rs. 38000 and a possible scam done by supervisor, delivery exec and others at Amazon. If they say that the exchange is done, then they can very well see the old phone that I still use with me.This could happen to any one of you and please be aware while dealing with @amazonIN.”","Supreme Court lawyer Mukul P Unny was scammed out of Rs 38,000 while attempting to exchange his iPhone 13 for an iPhone 15 on Amazon.in.
