Minister assured telcos

Reliance Jio, Airtel, Vi (Vodafone Idea) and other telecom operators raised the issue of adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues and rectification of calculation errors with communications minister Jyotiraditya Scindia at a meeting recently. According to a report by ET, the telecom companies urged Scindia to maintain the current contractual agreement between the government and telcos for license grants.The meeting was attended by Reliance Jio chairman Akash Ambani and managing director Pankaj Pawar, vice-chairman of Bharti Enterprises Rajan Mittal and Vodafone Idea MD Akshaya Moondra, among others.The report quotes an unnamed official who said “The telcos said licences can be converted into authorisation, but the agreement should continue, so as to provide regulatory certainty,”. “The issue (recompute of AGR dues ) was raised by Vodafone Idea and all other operators supported it,” said another official.During the meeting, Jio, Airtel and Vi also reiterated their demand to bring over-the-top (OTT) communication players like WhatsApp and Telegram under the regulatory fold. Earlier this year, the telcos demanded to bring OTT players under some sort of regulatory control as a majority of traffic, including commercial traffic, has largely shifted to such players.As per the report, Scinidia is believed to have assured the telcos that the AGR matter would be examined by the department of telecommunications (DoT). The minister also undertook another meeting with original equipment manufacturers.The meetings come amidst a Supreme Court’s rejection of the curative petitions of Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel on recomputing AGR dues. With the latest SC order, Vodafone Idea is now left facing over Rs 70,000 crore in AGR dues, while Airtel faces around Rs 44,000 crore in AGR dues.","Reliance Jio, Airtel, Vi (Vodafone Idea) and other telecom operators raised the issue of adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues and rectification of calculation errors with communications minister Jyotiraditya Scindia at a meeting recently.

Picture abhi baaki hai (The story isn't over yet)

Today, I celebrate 2 years of being in IndiGo (

InterGlobe Aviation

Ltd) and India. On our 18th IndiGo birthday last month, we celebrated many wonderful milestones and unveiled our ambitious plans for coming years. Our story has just started. I am grateful and proud to be a part of this incredible IndiGo journey with my colleagues - giving wings to the nation with over 2,000 daily flights, 430+ domestic and 100+ international routes, and growing every day.

When I had joined, I had shared the quote, ""Wherever you go, becomes a part of you somehow”. Being a part of IndiGo and now living now in India for two years....IndiGo and this beautiful country India have indeed become a part of me. Bharat ab ghar jaisa lagta hai.

India's essence is captured in its beautiful diversity. Of our 88 domestic cities, I had the pleasure of visiting our great teams in 30. From Thiruvananthapuram in the south to Leh in the north. My most recent visit was to Leh, where walking with my son at 18,000 feet at the Khardung La Pass was very special considering my roots are from a country where the highest ""hill"" is some 300 metres only and around 25% of the land is below sea level 😊

Here are some pictures from my travels in the last two years. Can you guess the cities?

Shark Tank judge Anupam Mittal has responded to Indigo CEO Pieter Elbers ’ post celebrating two years of being in India and Indigo. In a LinkedIn post , Elbers wrote “Being a part of IndiGo and now living now in India for two years....IndiGo and this beautiful country India have indeed become a part of me.

He started his career at KLM in 1992 as Manager Aircraft loading.Mittal replied to the post saying “Aap bhi ab ghar wale jaise lagte ho”. He further added “Good to see u have taken to India”.Take a look at the post here"," Indigo CEO Pieter Elbers celebrated two years of being in India and Indigo.

A group of experts studying misinformation has found that the biggest threats to online news trustworthiness are social media platform owners, politicians, and governments. They also claim that the boom in generative AI amplifies the spread of misinformation. The International Panel on the Information Environment (IPIE) recently conducted a survey highlighting concerns over content distribution and moderation.The panel’s findings were based on responses from over 400 academic researchers in fields including the social sciences, humanities and computer sciences from countries like the US, India and China, among others, the report said.“One of the most pressing concerns highlighted by our survey is the influence of social media platform owners,” said the IPIE’s co-founder Philip Howard, who is also a professor of internet studies at the University of Oxford, as per The Guardian.“Their control over content distribution and moderation policies significantly impacts the quality and integrity of information. The unchecked power of these entities poses a grave risk to the health of our global information environment,” he said.While the report did not name any specific tech platforms, Howard pointed to concerns surrounding Elon Musk 's ownership of X (formerly Twitter), saying that reports of Musk's tweets receiving disproportionate promotion.He also highlighted Frances Haugen, a whistleblower at Meta, who alleged that the company prioritises moderating English-language content over other languages on Facebook and Instagram.Adding to the concerns, the rise of generative AI is seen as amplifying the spread of misinformation. The report says that two-thirds of the surveyed experts believe AI-generated content has negatively impacted the information environment.“Generative AI tools have offered novel opportunities to produce propaganda at scale,” the report added.However, the report also acknowledges the potential positive applications of AI, claiming that AI can be “moderately hopeful” in areas such as helping detect misleading content.","The International Panel on the Information Environment (IPIE) recently conducted a survey highlighting concerns over content distribution and moderation.

US state of California has passed a bill that mandates schools to limit or ban the use of smartphones. According to news agency Reuters, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed into law on Monday. The California law is part of a growing statewide push to limit phone use by children in classrooms. In the past one year, more than a dozen states have enacted similar restrictions.These include Louisiana, Indiana, and Florida, among others.In a statement, Newsom said “We know that excessive smartphone use increases anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues - but we have the power to intervene. This new law will help students focus on academics, social development, and the world in front of them, not their screens, when they're in school"".Called the Phone-Free Schools Act , the law requires schools boards and other governing bodies to develop a policy to limit or prohibit student use of smartphones on campus by July 1, 2026.

Northvolt , a leading European battery manufacturer, has announced plans to lay off 1,600 employees across its Swedish operations. The decision comes in response to a strategic review triggered by the cancellation of a major contract with BMW .Reports suggest that car maker BMW — a shareholder – recently cancelled a $2.2 billion contract with the company due to production delays.The company has been facing challenges in scaling up production and securing additional funding. To address these issues, Northvolt is focusing its efforts on accelerating battery production at its Ett manufacturing center. This shift in strategy has necessitated significant job cuts.The layoffs will be distributed across various locations, with the most significant impact felt in Skelleftea, where 1,000 positions will be eliminated. Vasteras and Stockholm will also be affected, with 400 and 200 job cuts respectively.“While overall momentum for electrification remains strong, we need to make sure that we take the right actions at the right time in response to headwinds in the automotive market, and wider industrial climate. We now need to focus all energy and investments into our core business,” CEO Peter Carlsson says in a statement.“Success in the ramp-up of production at Northvolt Ett is critical for delivering to our customers and enabling sustainable business operations. Recent production records at Northvolt Ett show that we are on the right path, but the decisions we’re taking today, however tough, are required for Northvolt’s future,” Carlsson saidDespite the layoffs, Northvolt remains committed to its existing automotive customers and has implemented an acceleration program to boost production. Recent progress in this area has shown positive results, with a threefold increase in cell production since the beginning of the year.However, the company continues to face financial challenges. Northvolt has struggled to close its latest funding round, seeking to raise $1.2 billion but potentially settling for a smaller amount.The Swedish battery maker's largest shareholders, Volkswagen and Goldman Sachs , have not publicly disclosed their plans for future investment in the company. As Northvolt navigates these turbulent times, the outcome of its strategic decisions will determine its long-term viability in the competitive electric vehicle market.","Northvolt announced plans to lay off 1,600 employees across its Swedish operations.

"Watching child porn on your laptop, PC or smartphone is now a punishable offence; 3-7 years jail and fine",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/watching-this-porn-on-your-laptop-pc-or-smartphone-is-now-a-punishable-offence-3-7-years-jail-and-fine/articleshow/113608855.cms,"What the SC bench's 200-page judgement said

What is the punishment

The Supreme Court of India (SC) has ruled that the mere possession of child pornographic material, even if not disseminated further, constitutes a criminal offence. The court used the legal term "" inchoate crime "" to describe this act, which is defined as a criminal act committed in preparation for a further offence.In a landmark judgement, the court emphasised the importance of the doctrine of inchoate crimes in criminal jurisprudence.This doctrine addresses the legal culpability of individuals who engage in preparatory actions that precede the commission of a substantive crime.The court clarified that the intention behind possessing child pornographic material is punishable, regardless of whether there is an actual transmission of the content. The mere act of storing or possessing such material with a specific intention is considered a crime.""Inchoate crimes are defined as criminal acts that are committed in preparation for a further offence. The term 'inchoate' itself means 'undeveloped' or 'incomplete',"" a bench of Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud and Justice JB Pardiwala said.""What is sought to be penalised under Section 15 of the POCSO is the storage or possession of any child pornographic material when done with a particular intention or purpose as stipulated in sub-section(s) (1), (2) or (3), as the case may be. Thus, the bare textual reading of the said provision makes it clear that it is the intention which is being punished and not the commission of any criminal act in the traditional sense. This in the criminal jurisprudence is known as an ‘inchoate crime' or ‘inchoate offence',"" Justice Pardiwala, who penned the 200-page judgement, said.The judgement also addressed the concept of ""constructive possession,"" which means exercising control over contraband without physically possessing it. The court ruled that even if a person does not physically possess child pornographic material but has control over it, they can still be held liable under the law.The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act provides various punishments for different offences related to child pornography . The act outlines penalties ranging from fines to imprisonment, depending on the nature of the offence.As a report news agency PTI writes, the section 15 of the POCSO Act provides different punishments of varying jail terms or fine or both:* Section 15 (1), which deals with possession of child pornographic material, provides for a minimum fine of Rs 5,000 which may extend to Rs 10,000.* Section 15 (2), which deals with possession of child pornographic material for dissemination, entails jail term of up to three years or fine or both.* Section 15 (3), which deals with use of such materials for commercial gains, provides for three years to five years of jail term for first-time offenders or with fine or both.* Repeat offenders can be awarded jail terms ranging from five years to seven years along with a fine.","The Supreme Court of India has ruled that the mere possession of child pornographic material, even if not disseminated further, constitutes a criminal offence.
