Vodafone Idea Limited (VIL), a debt-ridden Indian telecom company, has approached the government for relief on its outstanding adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues of Rs 70,000 crore. This comes after the Supreme Court rejected the company's curative petition seeking correction in the AGR calculation and waiver of penalties and interest.VIL Chairman Ravinder Takkar revealed the company's engagement with senior government officials before and after the court's decision.He emphasized the government's responsibility in addressing the issue, given the court's rejection of the petition. ""While there was hope that the courts will obviously consider the petition, the fact that the court has not done so means that the action and responsibility, in some ways, falls squarely along with the government.""The government has since asked us to put together a comprehensive view of what we believe would be the right mechanism and request that we can make for addressing this challenge,"" Takkar said.The government holds a significant stake in VIL, while promoters Aditya Birla Group and Vodafone also have substantial ownership. Takkar expressed the government's understanding of the situation and its commitment to supporting VIL.The company's payment obligation to the government stood at Rs 2,09,520 crore as of June 30, 2024. VIL CEO Akshaya Moondra explained the reasons behind the Supreme Court's rejection of the curative petition and reiterated the company's commitment to its long-term business plan.To address its financial challenges, VIL has submitted a growth plan to banks for raising debt. Moondra expects to secure debt funding within 7-8 weeks, which will be used for network expansion. The company is also in discussions with new lenders to raise additional funds.VIL has awarded a Rs 30,000-crore contract to Nokia, Ericsson, and Samsung for 4G and 5G telecom network equipment. The equipment supply is expected to commence by the end of the next quarter, with substantial deployment by the end of the current fiscal year.","Vodafone Idea Limited (VIL) has approached the government for relief on its outstanding adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues of Rs 70,000 crore.

"Watching child porn on your laptop, PC or smartphone is now a punishable offence; 3-7 years jail and fine",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/watching-this-porn-on-your-laptop-pc-or-smartphone-is-now-a-punishable-offence-3-7-years-jail-and-fine/articleshow/113608855.cms,"What the SC bench's 200-page judgement said

What is the punishment

The Supreme Court of India (SC) has ruled that the mere possession of child pornographic material, even if not disseminated further, constitutes a criminal offence. The court used the legal term "" inchoate crime "" to describe this act, which is defined as a criminal act committed in preparation for a further offence.In a landmark judgement, the court emphasised the importance of the doctrine of inchoate crimes in criminal jurisprudence.This doctrine addresses the legal culpability of individuals who engage in preparatory actions that precede the commission of a substantive crime.The court clarified that the intention behind possessing child pornographic material is punishable, regardless of whether there is an actual transmission of the content. The mere act of storing or possessing such material with a specific intention is considered a crime.""Inchoate crimes are defined as criminal acts that are committed in preparation for a further offence. The term 'inchoate' itself means 'undeveloped' or 'incomplete',"" a bench of Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud and Justice JB Pardiwala said.""What is sought to be penalised under Section 15 of the POCSO is the storage or possession of any child pornographic material when done with a particular intention or purpose as stipulated in sub-section(s) (1), (2) or (3), as the case may be. Thus, the bare textual reading of the said provision makes it clear that it is the intention which is being punished and not the commission of any criminal act in the traditional sense. This in the criminal jurisprudence is known as an ‘inchoate crime' or ‘inchoate offence',"" Justice Pardiwala, who penned the 200-page judgement, said.The judgement also addressed the concept of ""constructive possession,"" which means exercising control over contraband without physically possessing it. The court ruled that even if a person does not physically possess child pornographic material but has control over it, they can still be held liable under the law.The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act provides various punishments for different offences related to child pornography . The act outlines penalties ranging from fines to imprisonment, depending on the nature of the offence.As a report news agency PTI writes, the section 15 of the POCSO Act provides different punishments of varying jail terms or fine or both:* Section 15 (1), which deals with possession of child pornographic material, provides for a minimum fine of Rs 5,000 which may extend to Rs 10,000.* Section 15 (2), which deals with possession of child pornographic material for dissemination, entails jail term of up to three years or fine or both.* Section 15 (3), which deals with use of such materials for commercial gains, provides for three years to five years of jail term for first-time offenders or with fine or both.* Repeat offenders can be awarded jail terms ranging from five years to seven years along with a fine.","The Supreme Court of India has ruled that the mere possession of child pornographic material, even if not disseminated further, constitutes a criminal offence.

Picture abhi baaki hai (The story isn't over yet)

Today, I celebrate 2 years of being in IndiGo (

InterGlobe Aviation

Ltd) and India. On our 18th IndiGo birthday last month, we celebrated many wonderful milestones and unveiled our ambitious plans for coming years. Our story has just started. I am grateful and proud to be a part of this incredible IndiGo journey with my colleagues - giving wings to the nation with over 2,000 daily flights, 430+ domestic and 100+ international routes, and growing every day.

When I had joined, I had shared the quote, ""Wherever you go, becomes a part of you somehow”. Being a part of IndiGo and now living now in India for two years....IndiGo and this beautiful country India have indeed become a part of me. Bharat ab ghar jaisa lagta hai.

India's essence is captured in its beautiful diversity. Of our 88 domestic cities, I had the pleasure of visiting our great teams in 30. From Thiruvananthapuram in the south to Leh in the north. My most recent visit was to Leh, where walking with my son at 18,000 feet at the Khardung La Pass was very special considering my roots are from a country where the highest ""hill"" is some 300 metres only and around 25% of the land is below sea level 😊

Here are some pictures from my travels in the last two years. Can you guess the cities?

The immense demand for tickets to the UK band's highly-anticipated show even overwhelmed BookMyShow, the official ticketing platform, resulting in a temporary crash that left many fans frustrated. Social media users shared screenshots of the incredibly long waiting queues, highlighting the sheer volume of people trying to secure their spot at the concerts.In response to the rapid sell-out of the initial two shows, Coldplay added a third performance on January 21, which also saw tickets vanish quickly.

US ahead, but China catching up fast

Till a few years back, the idea of Chinese automakers leading the charge in automotive technology would have seemed like science fiction. Yet, today, the reality is strikingly different. Two Chinese electric vehicle (EV) companies, Nio and XPeng , have secured prominent positions in Gartner Digital Automaker Index 2024 .

A Ludhiana-based industrialist has fallen victim to a cyber scam, losing Rs 1 crore. The accused impersonated officials from the Delhi Police, Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), and Indira Gandhi International Airport in New Delhi. They sent forged documents, including arrest warrants, court orders freezing the victim's bank account, and a fabricated CBI letter detailing a non-existent case.The victim is Rajneesh Ahuja , 78 from Sarabha Nagar said that he received a call on September 19 from an unknown number and the caller introduced himself as Abhishek Bansal. Bansal claimed to be a Delhi airport official investigating a case involving a parcel sent to Malaysia. He accused Ahuja of sending a parcel containing 16 passports and 58 debit cards to a person named Wangzhang in Malaysia through Global International Courier Company. Ahuja denied these allegations, stating that he had never sent a parcel to Malaysia.Bansal then suggested that Ahuja's identity might have been misused to send the parcel. He also informed Ahuja that he would be transferring the case to the Delhi police and that Ahuja could expect a call from a Delhi police official soon.The victim recounted that at 9:08 AM, he received a call from another number, and the caller identified himself as Sunil Kumar from the Delhi police. The caller informed him that the police had arrested a man named Sanjay Singh, a retired bank officer, who allegedly lured young boys with promises of sending them abroad but would instead hold them captive. Sanjay would then extort money from their families for their release. The caller claimed that Sanjay Singh had collected a total of Rs 38 crores through extortion, which was deposited in Ahuja's bank account.The caller further alleged that Sanjay had confessed to paying Ahuja a 10 percent commission for facilitating these transactions. Ahuja denied the accusations, stating that he did not know any Sanjay Kumar. The caller reiterated that Ahuja's ID proofs might have been misused to open a bank account in his name for extortion purposes. The supposed Delhi cop then urged Rajneesh Ahuja to cooperate with the police investigation, assuring him that he would be declared innocent after the inquiry.The fraudsters sent forged documents, including a fake arrest warrant in the complainant's name, a fake court order freezing Rajneesh Ahuja's bank accounts, and a fabricated CBI document bearing a fake stamp. Believing these documents to be genuine, the victim became frightened.The accused threatened Ahuja, demanding a security deposit of Rs 86 lakh to avoid arrest. They assured Ahuja that the money would be returned within three hours once the claims were verified. The victim was also instructed not to turn off their mobile phone. Ahuja made the payment into the bank account provided by the accused. However, minutes later, the accused called again, demanding an additional Rs 15 lakh, which Ahuja transferred to the given account.By 6 PM, Ahuja received a WhatsApp call from another number. The caller, identifying themselves as Anil Kumar from the CBI, informed Ahuja that the investigation had cleared them of any wrongdoing. They promised to have the arrest warrants canceled and Ahuja's name removed from the FIR. Additionally, the caller assured that the victim's money would be returned to their bank account by 12 noon on September 20.Despite these promises, Ahuja neither received their money nor could reach any of the callers. After realising that he had been scammed, Ahuja filed a complaint at Cyber Crime police station.","A Ludhiana-based industrialist has fallen victim to a cyber scam, losing Rs 1 crore.

Adapting to change: How the construction industry is embracing digital transformation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/madapting-to-change-how-the-construction-industry-is-embracing-digital-transformation/articleshow/113590687.cms,"Challenges to Digital Transformation

Future of Construction

The Role of Innovation Culture

India's construction industry is an important pillar of a rapidly growing economy. There has been a swift change in the industry, with countries implementing digital tools to stay ahead in the race, and so is India. Its construction industry is set for massive growth, projected to record a 17% increase in revenues in the coming year.Digital transformation is revolutionising the construction industry by unlocking new possibilities for the future.From virtual reality and Building Information Modeling (BIM) to robotics, drones, and IoT integration, the industry is undergoing a digital transformation. These are some of the technologies that will be used by Indian construction firms to drive efficiency, streamline operations, visualise designs with precision, make data-driven decisions, and optimise the overall building process and cost.The level of technology adoption by businesses in the country stands at around 28% of their expenditures. This is higher compared to other advanced markets, such as Japan and Singapore. A key driver behind this is the realisation that digital tools can considerably reduce project schedules and improve coordination among stakeholders and resource use optimization to realise better quality and safety.While the prospects look promising, this path toward full digital integration is strewn with problems and shortfalls. There can indeed be seen a massive skills gap in the workforce, where technologies such as AI and machine learning increasingly arise. Most of the manpower today in this sector are lacking in-depth knowledge of technologies like AI, machine learning, and the right use of devices. But Indian construction companies are rapidly bridging these gaps aggressively by up-skilling their workforce.Also, technology is still an important cost factor in an environment of high inflation and tight budgets for the owners and occupiers. Another set of challenges remains in the complexity and fragmentation of the construction industry in India. The ability to apply new technology across this diversity and decentralisation of projects remains formidable.This is where the companies are advised to follow a 'small start, pilot projects, and gradually scale up' approach. This way, change can be managed properly, and the risks of great digital adoption may also be lessened. To top the list as a second is that executive leadership in creating an innovative culture has been demonstrated to enable implementation of digital transformation through a supporting environment. Through the practice of leading in the front, executives can help shift organisational mindsets toward the acceptance of new methods in technology application and support.3D printing and additive manufacturing are game-changers to the construction industry in the realisation of complex designs while reducing waste and costs. An entire component or even a whole structure can be produced using automated laying processes that ensure positioned material. In this manner, there is a reduced dependence on traditional processes dependent on a high level of labour, through the elimination of waste in materials and a reduction in construction time.Large-scale 3D printers have been used to successfully build, among other things, a number of individual homes, for example, overpass bridge, and even commercial buildings—to look forward into the future of innovative realisable with the help of such inventions.IoT, sensor technology, and automation are among the digital technologies that will assist smart buildings to be more efficient, safe, and sustainable. The energy used automatically monitors, lighting, and temperature is optimised, and maintenance needs are even indicated by the building itself when these systems are connected.In short, smart cities have gone a step further, evidenced in how resources are managed efficiently, viewed through carbon footprints that are being reduced through the web of infrastructures being utilised to further boost the future of the urban living experience. In summary, all these will represent a shift to more sustainable and adaptive urban environments.It is not simply about adopting new tools; rather, it is an industry that integrates digital technologies, fosters a culture of innovation, and allows creativity, collaboration, and adaptability. Despite the fact that digitization has a positive effect on technical efficiency, team dynamics are enhanced in construction teams, whereby sharing ideas, leveraging expertise, and exploring new approaches to solving complex challenges become possible. So, in brief, what is happening is that digital transformation in the Indian construction domain is not just a buzzword; it is a revolution that changed and continues to redefine design, execution, and project management concepts. Getting over challenges regarding digital adoption and successfully nurturing a culture of innovation, Indian construction firms are not just matching the pace of change but leading the race toward the future. Of course, there are teething issues in this digital journey also, but by strategic planning and leadership with lifelong learning enshrined into the hearts and minds of Indian construction industry professionals, extraordinary growth and success would be achieved by the Indian construction industry in the digital era.-- Rahul Sahani, Co-founder & COO, McCoy Mart","India's construction industry is set for massive growth, projected to record a 17% increase in revenues in the coming year.

Byju Raveendran, the founder and CEO of edtech giant Byju's , has expressed his deep regret for the recent challenges faced by the company and its workforce. Amidst reports of layoffs and financial difficulties , Raveendran assured employees of his support and commitment to the company's future.In a letter to his employees, Raveendran acknowledged the ""turbulent times"" that Byju's has been navigating and expressed his gratitude for the dedication of the company's employees.“It won’t be much, but each one of you will receive a small payment by this weekend. This is not nearly what you deserve, but it is what I can offer right now. And I promise you this — the day we regain control of our company, you will get more than your fair share,” Raveendran said in the letter. As reported by Business Standard, he requested employees to remain dedicated to their roles and continue teaching at the firm.“I owe you an apology. You have given your best, yet we have not been able to compensate you for your work. This is not right, and for that, I am truly sorry. The past three months have been a perfect storm of legal battles, financial uncertainties, and challenges none of us ever expected. But through it all, you have stood strong. You have upheld the highest calling of a teacher — to educate, to inspire, and to guide,” added Raveendran.Raveendran also outlined the company's plans to address the challenges and ensure its long-term sustainability. He assured employees that Byju's remains committed to its mission of providing quality education to students worldwide and is taking proactive steps to strengthen its financial position and operations.“Because we believe in this company, we believe in our mission, and most importantly, we believe in you. We know that Byju’s is not just a business model. We serve millions of students across the country, and we do that through the tireless efforts of thousands of teachers like you,” said Raveendran.He also claimed that US-based lenders have filed a weak case, making a claim on the company's Indian assets. “But they have no entitlement to these assets, as per the agreement we signed with them. The so-called trust that represents them in India has no legal standing. It does not represent the majority of these lenders. Still, the reality is that I no longer control the company’s bank accounts. We are confident of winning this case, and while we wait, I understand the burden this places on you,” said Raveendran.He stated that the legal battles are a personal challenge for him. “I know that, together, we will come out of this stronger than before. We cannot stop. We cannot even slow down. Because we have millions of students depending on us. They are the reason we keep going. They are the reason we fight these battles.

A recent survey by LocalCircles has revealed that a significant majority of UPI users (around 75%) would be likely to discontinue using the service if transaction charges were introduced. This finding underscores the strong preference for UPI's current fee-free model and the potential impact of any changes on its widespread adoption.The survey, which received responses from over 42,000 individuals across 308 districts, found that 38% of respondents rely on UPI for more than half of their payment transactions, making it their primary method for digital payments.This preference highlights the convenience and efficiency that UPI offers.Despite its popularity, the survey also indicated that only 22% of UPI users would be willing to pay a transaction fee. The remaining 75% expressed a clear desire to maintain the current fee-free structure.These findings come as UPI continues to experience rapid growth. In the 2023-24 fiscal year, UPI transactions surpassed 100 billion for the first time, reaching a total of 131 billion. The value of transactions also increased significantly, reaching Rs 199.89 trillion.The survey's results are particularly significant given the increasing reliance on UPI for a wide range of transactions, from daily purchases to bill payments. Any potential introduction of transaction charges could have a substantial impact on the usage of UPI and the overall digital payments landscape in India.In response to the survey findings, LocalCircles plans to escalate the matter with the Ministry of Finance and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to ensure that the concerns of UPI users are taken into account before any decisions regarding transaction charges are made.""With UPI rapidly becoming an integral part of nearly 4 in 10 consumers, there is strong resistance to any kind of direct or indirect transaction charges being imposed.

Elon Musk's SpaceX to send uncrewed Starships to Mars by 2026: “One of my biggest concerns right now..”,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/elon-musks-spacex-to-send-uncrewed-starships-to-mars-by-2026-one-of-my-biggest-concerns-right-now-/articleshow/113588981.cms,"Here’s what Elon Musk wrote in the post

SpaceX plans to launch about five uncrewed Starships to Mars in two years.

If those all land safely, then crewed missions are possible in four years. If we encounter challenges, then the crewed missions will be postponed another two years.

It is only possible to travel from Earth to Mars every two years, when the planets are aligned. This increases the difficulty of the task, but also serves to immunize Mars from many catastrophic events on Earth.

No matter what happens with landing success, SpaceX will increase the number of spaceships traveling to Mars exponentially with every transit opportunity. We want to enable anyone who wants to be a space traveler to go to Mars! That means you or your family or friends – anyone who dreams of great adventure.

Eventually, there will be thousands of Starships going to Mars and it will a glorious sight to see! Can you imagine? Wow.

The fundamental existential question is whether humanity becomes sustainably multiplanetary before something happens on Earth to prevent that, for example nuclear war, a supervirus or population collapse that weakens civilization to the point where it loses the ability to send supply ships to Mars.

One of my biggest concerns right now is that the Starship program is being smothered by a mountain of government bureaucracy that grows every year. This stifling red tape is affecting all large projects in America, which is why, for example, California has spent ~$7 billion dollars and several years on high-speed rail, but only has a 1600 ft section of concrete to show for it!

While I have many concerns about a potential Kamala regime, my absolute showstopper is that the bureaucracy currently choking America to death is guaranteed to grow under a Democratic Party administration. This would destroy the Mars program and doom humanity.

It cannot happen. Your help would be much appreciated. This is a fork, maybe the fork, in the road of human destiny.

Elon Musk says that his SpaceX plans to launch an uncrewed spaceship to Mar in the next two years. Announcing the same in a post on X (formerly Twitter), the tech CEO said “SpaceX plans to launch about five uncrewed Starships to Mars in two years.” He further stated “No matter what happens with landing success, SpaceX will increase the number of spaceships traveling to Mars exponentially with every transit opportunity.”In the post, the Tesla chief also expressed his concerns about the Starship program.“One of my biggest concerns right now is that the Starship program is being smothered by a mountain of government bureaucracy that grows every year.

Pro models gain traction as price drops, vanilla iPhone also finds more buyers this year

AI on hold, but hardware upgrades drive majority sales



Analysts predict another record quarter for Apple

Apple's highly anticipated iPhone 16 series hit stores across India on Friday, September 20, 2024, drawing enthusiastic crowds in one of the fastest-growing markets for the iPhone-maker in the last few years. Industry experts sees this as a sign of Apple further bolstering its presence in India, as they suggests growth in number of sales from last year and record quarter for iPhone-maker in the country.The only-two physical locations of Apple Stores in Mumbai and New Delhi buzzed with excitement, as eager customers formed long queues outside stores, with some waiting since the previous night to be among the first to own the new devices.The launch event, which began at 8 AM, saw a mix of pre-order customers and walk-ins, all eager to experience Apple's newest offerings.""The atmosphere in Mumbai for this phone is absolutely electric,"" said Ujiwal Shah, who waited for over 21 hours to be first in line at the Bandra-Kurla Complex store. This sentiment was echoed across the country, with similar scenes unfolding at Apple Saket, New Delhi.Tarun Pathak, Research Director atCounterpoint Research , noted, ""Our channel checks yesterday indicated a strong opening for iPhone 16. Some of the sellers reported 18-20% opening day sales compared to last year.""While lines formed outside the retail locations, quick-commerce platforms, like Blinkit and BigBasket, promised the iPhone 16 on people's doorstep in just 10 minutes. The stocks ran out in a couple of minutes on the two apps, a similar trend seen during the pre-order day on e-commerce stores.Many customers still chose to visit physical stores, citing the desire for an immersive Apple experience. ""I came at 6 AM and couldn't wait to get the new phone in my hands,"" said one customer, a customer from Noida who came down to Delhi and was particularly excited about the improved zoom camera and the new Dessert Titanium colour of the iPhone 16 Pro .Prabhu Ram, VP of Industry Research Group at CyberMedia Research (CMR), noted, ""Our initial assessment indicates that the iPhone 16 series, including both the base and Pro models, has been well-received in the market.""Beyond the new iPhones, many customers coupled their purchases with AirPods 4 , while others also bought the new Apple Watches, upgrading their whole ecosystem. ""I'm going all in on the Apple ecosystem this time,"" grinned Rahul Kapoor, showcasing his new iPhone 16, AirPods 4, and Apple Watch. ""It's a big investment, but the seamless integration is worth every rupee.""However, not all customers were successful in their quest for the new iPhone. Amit Gupta, a walk-in customer who arrived at noon, left empty-handed. ""I thought coming during lunch hour would be smart, but they were already out of the Pro models,"" he sighed. ""I guess I'll have to try my luck online or wait for the next stock.""The Day 1 dynamics differed between India and the United States, Apple’s home market. Counterpoint Research data indicates that US stores had more inventory available for walk-in customers compared to previous years. In contrast, Indian stores saw longer queues and higher demand for pre-orders, particularly for the Pro models.Out of the four models, the regular iPhone 16 is seen to be the crowd's pick this year, however the reduced prices of Pro models this year, starting Rs 1,19,900 compared to starting price of Rs 1,39,900 for the iPhone 15 Pro models, has seemingly bought-in more takers for the iPhone 16 Pro models than in the recent years.""The more accessible pricing on the Pro models compared to their predecessors has made them more appealing to a wider range of consumers,"" said Ram.""The iPhone 16 seems like gaining massive popularity"" said Pathak, who suggests that there has been a ""lot of demand for the base 16 variant compared to last year"" in India.Ram notes, ""The ongoing premiumization trend in the Indian smartphone market provides favourable tailwinds to drive upgrades."" This shift is evident in the strong performance across the iPhone 16 range.Apple iPhone 16 series have launched without the much-anticipated Apple Intelligence AI software pre-installed. Apple has been heavily marketing these AI features since June, but users will need to wait for software updates to access them fully.Interestingly, Counterpoint Research noted that in the US, ""Buyers are upgrading because they are looking to upgrade – Apple Intelligence did not appear to be a primary purchase mover. Many users are coming from older devices such as the iPhone 12, iPhone 11 and even older.""This trend is mirrored in India, but with additional factors driving purchases. Pathak from Counterpoint Research explained, ""Plus, a lot of people upgrading from older 11s or iPhone 12 are finding 16 a great upgrade."" He further elaborated on the Indian market, stating, ""Hardware features like camera, battery and Apple silicon got a good upgrade compared to last year's base model."" These improvements are particularly appealing to Indian consumers looking for substantial upgrades from their older devices.When asked about the reasons behind people buying the new iPhones despite the absence of Apple Intelligence at launch, Pathak added, ""Apple Intelligence-ready iPhones is one reason for people switching to new models even though roll out will happen later.""The iPhone 16 marks a significant milestone for Apple's strategy in India. For the second time in a row, India-made iPhones were made available globally on the day of the official release, underscoring the country's growing importance in Apple's supply chain.With the festive season approaching, analysts expect further boosts in sales, especially for the premium Pro and Pro Max models. The availability of made-in-India iPhones – the Pro models are reported to be assembled later this year in the country for the first time ever – could also contribute to shorter lead times and improved availability for Indian consumers.Pathak shared an optimistic outlook: ""We believe Apple is likely to have a record new iPhone sales quarter in India and with this momentum it is likely to reach our estimated 12 million iPhone sales in India.""Prabhu Ram from CMR added, ""The ongoing premiumization trend in the Indian smartphone market provides favourable tailwinds to drive upgrades in the Indian market. CyberMedia Research anticipates a substantial 30% year-over-year growth compared to the iPhone 15 generation in the launch quarter."" He further projected, ""This growth trajectory positions Apple to potentially capture up to 8% of the hypercompetitive Indian smartphone market by the end of 2024.""Apple also plans to move 25% of its iPhone production to India by 2025, aligning with the country's "" Make in India "" initiative. Foxconn , one of Apple's key contract manufacturers, has already been producing the regular iPhone models in India, and reports suggest that Apple's manufacturers will also begin assembling the Pro models in the country this year.The success of the iPhone 16 launch day in India, coupled with the introduction of made-in-India units and innovative delivery methods, signals a new chapter in Apple's relationship with one of the world's fastest-growing smartphone markets.","Apple's highly anticipated iPhone 16 series hit stores across India on Friday, September 20, 2024.

This move could result in substantial fines and force significant changes to Google 's business model.EU regulators are reportedly drafting a formal charge sheet under the Digital Markets Act (DMA), focusing on how Google displays rival product results across its specialised search services, such as Google Flights and Google Hotels.Bloomberg reports that the preliminary findings could be issued before the end of October, though the timing may shift due to leadership changes at the European Commission.If Google fails to address the EU's concerns, and the company has until March 2025, else it could face penalties of up to 10% of its global annual revenue.The company met with EU officials this week in an attempt to mitigate regulatory worries, proposing a new design for its search tabs that would give users easier access to alternative search platforms and direct suppliers.This latest action follows a string of antitrust battles between the EU and Google. Last week, the company lost its appeal against a €2.4 billion fine related to its shopping comparison service. However, it successfully overturned a €1.5 billion fine concerning online advertising practices earlier this week.Google is not alone in facing DMA complaints, with Apple and Meta also under scrutiny. The EU's aggressive stance reflects growing global efforts to regulate big tech companies and ensure fair competition in digital markets.As the March 2025 deadline for a final decision approaches, the tech industry and regulators alike will be closely watching the outcome of this latest confrontation between the EU and one of the world's most influential technology companies.","EU regulators are reportedly drafting a formal charge sheet under the Digital Markets Act.
