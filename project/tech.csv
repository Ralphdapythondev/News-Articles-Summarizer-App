Picture abhi baaki hai (The story isn't over yet)

Today, I celebrate 2 years of being in IndiGo (

InterGlobe Aviation

Ltd) and India. On our 18th IndiGo birthday last month, we celebrated many wonderful milestones and unveiled our ambitious plans for coming years. Our story has just started. I am grateful and proud to be a part of this incredible IndiGo journey with my colleagues - giving wings to the nation with over 2,000 daily flights, 430+ domestic and 100+ international routes, and growing every day.

When I had joined, I had shared the quote, ""Wherever you go, becomes a part of you somehow”. Being a part of IndiGo and now living now in India for two years....IndiGo and this beautiful country India have indeed become a part of me. Bharat ab ghar jaisa lagta hai.

India's essence is captured in its beautiful diversity. Of our 88 domestic cities, I had the pleasure of visiting our great teams in 30. From Thiruvananthapuram in the south to Leh in the north. My most recent visit was to Leh, where walking with my son at 18,000 feet at the Khardung La Pass was very special considering my roots are from a country where the highest ""hill"" is some 300 metres only and around 25% of the land is below sea level 😊

Here are some pictures from my travels in the last two years. Can you guess the cities?

Shark Tank judge Anupam Mittal has responded to Indigo CEO Pieter Elbers ’ post celebrating two years of being in India and Indigo.

This move could result in substantial fines and force significant changes to Google 's business model.EU regulators are reportedly drafting a formal charge sheet under the Digital Markets Act (DMA), focusing on how Google displays rival product results across its specialised search services, such as Google Flights and Google Hotels.Bloomberg reports that the preliminary findings could be issued before the end of October, though the timing may shift due to leadership changes at the European Commission.If Google fails to address the EU's concerns, and the company has until March 2025, else it could face penalties of up to 10% of its global annual revenue.The company met with EU officials this week in an attempt to mitigate regulatory worries, proposing a new design for its search tabs that would give users easier access to alternative search platforms and direct suppliers.This latest action follows a string of antitrust battles between the EU and Google. Last week, the company lost its appeal against a €2.4 billion fine related to its shopping comparison service. However, it successfully overturned a €1.5 billion fine concerning online advertising practices earlier this week.Google is not alone in facing DMA complaints, with Apple and Meta also under scrutiny. The EU's aggressive stance reflects growing global efforts to regulate big tech companies and ensure fair competition in digital markets.As the March 2025 deadline for a final decision approaches, the tech industry and regulators alike will be closely watching the outcome of this latest confrontation between the EU and one of the world's most influential technology companies.","EU regulators are reportedly drafting a formal charge sheet under the Digital Markets Act.

Explained: What is selfie authentication fraud and how to stay safe,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/explained-what-is-selfie-authentication-fraud-and-how-to-stay-safe/articleshow/113568246.cms,"How does selfie authentication fraud work?

Tips to stay safe from selfie authentication fraud:

Selfie authentication is a security measure used by many online services to verify a user's identity by comparing a real-time photo of their face with a stored reference image. While this method can be convenient, it's also vulnerable to a new type of fraud known as selfie authentication fraud .1. Deepfakes: Malicious actors can create highly realistic deepfakes , which are synthetic media that can manipulate a person's appearance or voice.By using advanced AI techniques, they can generate fake selfies that closely resemble a legitimate user's face.2. Social engineering: Attackers may combine deepfakes with social engineering tactics to deceive online services. For instance, they might send a phishing email containing a link to a fake login page that asks for a selfie. When the victim uploads their photo, the attacker can capture it and use it to create a deepfake.3. Account takeover : Once the attacker has a deepfake of the victim's face, they can use it to bypass facial recognition security measures and gain unauthorised access to the victim's accounts.1. Be cautious of phishing attempts: Be wary of unsolicited emails, especially those asking for personal information or containing suspicious links. Never click on links in emails from unknown senders.2. Use strong passwords: In addition to facial recognition, use strong, unique passwords for your online accounts. Avoid using the same password for multiple accounts.3. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): 2FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a code sent to your phone or email in addition to your password.4. Be mindful of social media privacy settings: Limit who can see your photos and posts on social media to reduce the risk of your images being used to create deepfakes.5. Report suspicious activity: If you suspect that your account has been compromised, contact the service provider immediately and report the incident.By following these tips, you can help protect yourself from selfie authentication fraud and safeguard your online accounts.","Selfie authentication is a security measure used by many online services to verify a user's identity.

“Team,

All eyes have been on Intel since we announced Q2 earnings. There has been no shortage of rumours and speculation about the company, including last week’s Board of Directors meeting, so I’m writing today to provide some updates and outline what comes next.

Let me start by saying we had a highly productive and supportive Board meeting. We have a strong Board comprised of independent directors whose job it is to challenge and push us to perform at our best. And we had deep discussions about our strategy, our portfolio and the immediate progress we are making against the plan we announced on August 1.

The Board and I agreed that we have a lot of work ahead to drive greater efficiency, improve our profitability and enhance our market competitiveness—and there are three key takeaways from last week’s meeting that I want to focus on:

We must build on our momentum in Foundry as we near the launch of Intel 18A and drive greater capital efficiency across this part of our business. We must continue acting with urgency to create a more competitive cost structure and deliver the $10B in savings target we announced last month. We must refocus on our strong x86 franchise as we drive our AI strategy while streamlining our product portfolio in service to Intel customers and partners.

We have several pieces of news to share that support these priorities.

Amazon Web Services selects Intel Foundry

Today we announced that we will expand our strategic collaboration with Amazon Web Services (AWS). This includes a co-investment in custom chip designs, and we have announced a multi-year, multi-billion-dollar framework covering product and wafers from Intel.

Specifically, Intel Foundry will produce an AI fabric chip for AWS on Intel 18A. We will also produce a custom Xeon 6 chip on Intel 3 that builds on our existing partnership, under which Intel produces Xeon Scalable processors for AWS. More broadly, we expect to have deep engagement with AWS on additional designs spanning Intel 18A, Intel 18AP and Intel 14A.

This framework reflects the power of our “better together” strategy, anchored on our integrated portfolio across foundry services, infrastructure and x86 products. And with the 5N4Y finish line in sight, we are beginning to see a meaningful uptick in interest from foundry customers. This includes continued momentum in advanced packaging, which remains a meaningful differentiator for Intel Foundry as we have tripled our deal pipeline since the beginning of the year.

U.S. Secure Enclave award

Earlier today, we also announced that Intel has been awarded up to $3B in direct funding under the CHIPS and Science Act for the U.S. government’s Secure Enclave program. This program is designed to expand the trusted manufacturing of leading-edge semiconductors for the

U.S. government

. As the only American company that both designs and manufactures leading-edge logic chips, we will help secure the domestic chip supply chain.

This news, combined with our AWS announcement, demonstrates the continued progress we are making to build a world-class foundry business.

Greater independence for Intel Foundry

To build on our progress, we plan to establish Intel Foundry as an independent subsidiary inside of Intel. This governance structure will complete the process we initiated earlier this year when we separated the P&L and financial reporting for Intel Foundry and Intel Products.

A subsidiary structure will unlock important benefits. It provides our external foundry customers and suppliers with clearer separation and independence from the rest of Intel. Importantly, it also gives us future flexibility to evaluate independent sources of funding and optimize the capital structure of each business to maximise growth and shareholder value creation.

There is no change to our Intel Foundry leadership team, which continues to report to me. We will also establish an operating board that includes independent directors to govern the subsidiary. This supports our continued focus on driving greater transparency, optimization and accountability across the business.

A more focused and efficient Intel Foundry will further enhance collaboration with Intel Products. And our capabilities across design and manufacturing will remain a source of competitive differentiation and strength.

A more efficient Intel Foundry manufacturing buildout

A key priority for Intel Foundry is to increase our capital efficiency. Our manufacturing investments across three continents have laid the foundation for a world-class foundry for the AI era. Now that we have completed our transition to EUV, it’s time to shift from a period of accelerated investment to a more normalised cadence of node development and a more flexible and efficient capital plan.

We will maintain our Smart Capital approach to maximize financial flexibility as we complete our manufacturing buildout, making some adjustments to the near-term scope and pace of our manufacturing expansion.

We recently increased capacity in Europe through our fab in Ireland, which will remain our lead European hub for the foreseeable future. We will pause our projects in Poland and Germany by approximately two years based on anticipated market demand.

Malaysia remains an active design and manufacturing hub through our existing operations. We plan to complete the construction of our new advanced packaging factory in Malaysia but will align the startup with market conditions and increased utilization of our existing capacity.

There are no changes to our other manufacturing locations. We remain committed to our U.S. manufacturing investments and are moving forward with our projects in Arizona, Oregon, New Mexico and Ohio. We remain well-positioned to scale up production around the world based on market demand as we grow our foundry business.

A stronger Intel Products portfolio focused on x86

We are also taking actions to strengthen and streamline our Intel Products portfolio, where we have identified clear opportunities to drive greater focus, speed and efficiency.

Our top priority is to maximise the value of our x86 franchise across client, edge and data centre markets, including with a broader range of custom chiplets and other customised offerings that meet emerging customer needs, as demonstrated by today’s AWS announcement.

Our AI investments—including continued leadership of the AI PC category, our strong position with AI in data centre, and our accelerator portfolio—will leverage and complement our x86 franchise with a focus on enterprise, cost-efficient inferencing.

Alongside this, we are taking steps toward simplifying our portfolio to unlock efficiency, accelerate innovation and deliver more integrated solutions.

This includes moving our Edge and Automotive businesses into CCG, where we have a big opportunity to leverage our core client business and extend our leadership in the AI PC category to a wide range of vertical edge solutions. In NEX, we will be focusing the business on networking and telco. And we are moving Integrated Photonics Solutions into DCAI as we focus on driving a more focused R&D plan that's fully aligned with our top business priorities.

In addition, we are integrating our Software and Incubation business into our core business units to foster more integrated roadmaps, unlock efficiencies and create value.

An engine of financial performance

Collectively, these changes are critical steps forward as we build a leaner, simpler and more efficient Intel. And they build on the immediate progress we have made since announcing our plan on August 1 to create a more competitive cost structure.

Through our voluntary early retirement and separation offerings, we are more than halfway to our workforce reduction target of approximately 15,000 by the end of the year. We still have difficult decisions to make and will notify impacted employees in the middle of October. Additionally, we are implementing plans to reduce or exit about two-thirds of our real estate globally by the end of the year.

As we continue acting with urgency to execute the plan we announced last month, we are also working to carefully manage our cash as we meaningfully improve our balance sheet and liquidity. This includes through selling part of our stake in Altera—which is something we have talked about publicly several times and has long been part of our strategy to generate proceeds for Intel on Altera’s path to an IPO.

All eyes will remain on us. We need to fight for every inch and execute better than ever before. Because that’s the only way to quiet our critics and deliver the results we know we’re capable of achieving.

We must maintain our focus on innovation while also becoming an engine of operational efficiency and financial performance that’s built to win in the market.

As I’ve said before, this is the most significant transformation of Intel in over four decades. Not since the memory to microprocessor transition have we attempted something so essential. We succeeded then—and we will meet this moment and build a stronger Intel for decades to come.

On behalf of the entire ELT and our Board of Directors, thank you for all you’re doing. I greatly appreciate your patience, grit and resilience as we do the hard work needed to deliver on our plan and position our company for the future.

Warning for Google Chrome users: Hackers using this new technique for stealing passwords online,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/warning-for-google-chrome-users-hackers-using-this-new-technique-for-stealing-passwords-online/articleshow/113552827.cms,"How hackers are stealing login info using the malware

How to ‘quit’ Google Chrome’s Kiosk mode

Researchers have spotted a new way that hackers are using to steal passwords of users of Google Chrome . They install malware that locks the screen, essentially preventing users from accessing any other app on the system.According to a team of researchers at OALABS – a malware analysis services company – stealers are now using a new type of Google Chrome malware that first locks users out of their system, preventing them from accessing any other apps and then forcing them to type in login credentials like usernames and passwords and then steal them.The malware, dubbed ‘ StealC ’, uses a new technique called “AutoIt Credential Flusher” that forces victims to enter their Google account details to access the system. The researchers say that this technique has been in use since last month.The researchers claim that StealC uses Chrome’s Kiosk Mode feature, a functionality designed to restrict user access on public computers by locking them into a fullscreen Chrome window and disabling standard exit keys like F11 and Esc.Used at public places, Kiosk Mode has its elements like toolbars, navigation buttons and the address bar removed from Chrome's interface so that there is no interaction with people. The malware leverages this mode to present users with a seemingly unavoidable page that prompts them to enter their Google account credentials to regain control of their system.Once the unsuspecting individual types in their username and password, this sensitive information is immediately captured and stolen by the StealC malware, an info-stealing program first identified in February of the previous year.If you are affected by this, and are stuck in Chrome’s Kiosk mode, use keyboard shortcuts like “Alt+F4”, “Ctrl + Shift + Esc”, “Ctrl + Alt + Delete” and “Alt+Tab” to exit the mode, or go to Windows Task Manager to quit the app.If you are unable to do it, restart the PC, scan it for any virus or malware and remove them.","Researchers have spotted a new way that hackers are using to steal passwords of users of Google Chrome.

Explained: What is Pharming online scam and tips to stay safe,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/explained-what-is-pharming-online-scam-and-tips-to-stay-safe/articleshow/113547631.cms,"How does pharming work?

Compromised DNS Servers : Hackers often target Domain Name System (DNS) servers, which translate website addresses (URLs) into numerical IP addresses. By compromising these servers, attackers can manipulate the DNS records, directing users to malicious websites instead of the intended destination.

Malicious Code Injection: Attackers may also inject malicious code into legitimate websites, either through vulnerabilities in the website's content management system or by exploiting security flaws in the web server. This code can then redirect users to phishing or malware-infected sites.



Tips to stay safe from pharming:

Verify Website URLs: Always double-check the URL of the website you are visiting. Look for any unusual characters or spelling errors.

Use Reputable Browsers and Antivirus Software: Keep your web browser and antivirus software up-to-date with the latest security patches. Reputable browsers often have built-in security features to protect against phishing attacks.

Be Cautious of Phishing Emails: Be wary of unsolicited emails, especially those asking for personal information or containing suspicious links. Never click on links in emails from unknown senders.

Use a VPN: A Virtual Private Network (VPN) can help protect your privacy and security online by encrypting your internet traffic and hiding your IP address.

Avoid Public Wi-Fi Networks: Public Wi-Fi networks are often less secure than private networks. Avoid using public Wi-Fi for sensitive activities like online banking or shopping.
