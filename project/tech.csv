"Microsoft may be developing its own AI model to compete with Google, OpenAI",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-may-be-developing-its-own-ai-model-to-compete-with-google-openai/articleshow/109895039.cms,"Why this development is important

Microsoft is said to be training an in-house AI language model that can compete against the large models developed by Alphabet's Google and OpenAI , a report has said. The model is said to be overseen by Mustafa Suleyman , an ex-Googler who joined as CEO of Microsoft AI unit from Inflection AI earlier this year.According to a report by The Information, the new model is internally referred to as MAI-1 and the exact purpose of the model has not been determined yet.Microsoft may also preview the new model at its Build developer conference later this month, the report said.“This is a Microsoft model, not one carried over from Inflection, although it may build on training data and other not one carried over from Inflection, although it may build on training data and other tech from the startup,” the report said. It is separate from the models that Inflection previously released, the publication cited two Microsoft employees with knowledge of the effort as saying.This is reportedly the first instance since Microsoft made over $10 billion investment OpenAI that it is training a model by itself.“For the first time since it invested more than $10 billion into OpenAl in exchange for the rights to reuse the startup's Al models, Microsoft is training a new, in-house AI model large enough to compete with state-of-the-art models from Google, Anthropic and OpenAl itself,” the report noted.Microsoft has been using large language models (LLMs) that have been developed by OpenAI.The report also noted that MAI-1 “will be far larger than any of the smaller, open source models that Microsoft has previously trained.” This means that the AI model will require more computing power as well as training data, making it a possibility that it will be expensive, according to the people.“MAI-1 will have roughly 500 billion parameters, or settings that can be adjusted to determine what models learn during training,” the report said.Meanwhile, OpenAI's GPT-4 has more than 1 trillion parameters, while smaller open source models released by firms like Meta Platforms and Mistral have 70 billion parameters.","Microsoft is said to be training an in-house AI language model that can compete against the large models developed by Alphabet's Google and OpenAI.

iPad Pro with new display and chip (also a whole lot of AI prowess)

Not one, but two iPad Air models are expected this evening

New accessories for the new iPads

More surprises in store?

Apple's highly anticipated "" Let Loose "" event is happening today, promising to showcase the latest and greatest in iPads. Rumours swirling about new iPad Pro and iPad Air models, as well as new accessories like the Apple Pencil and Magic Keyboard , there's plenty to look forward to. Here's everything you need to know about the event and how to catch all the action.The virtual event starts at 7:30 PM IST (10 AM ET or 7 AM PT) and will be live-streamed across various platforms.You can watch it live on Apple's website, the Apple TV app, or the company's YouTube channel.The spotlight will undoubtedly be on the new iPad Pro lineup, rumoured to feature a significant upgrade after a two-year halt. Apple is expected to introduce an 11-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro, boasting OLED displays, ditching LCD and mini-LED screens, promising to deliver deeper blacks, more vibrant colours, and improved power efficiency.Under the hood, the new iPad Pro models are expected to be powered by the next-generation M4 chip, a significant upgrade from the current M1 and M2 chips. The M4 chip is rumoured to strongly emphasise artificial intelligence capabilities, potentially unlocking new possibilities for app developers and users alike.The iPad Air is also set to receive some love at the ""Let Loose"" event. Reports suggest that Apple will introduce a larger 12.9-inch model alongside the existing 10.9-inch version. This move would give iPad Air fans a more spacious canvas to work and play on while maintaining the sleek and portable design they know and love. While the early rumours hinted at the new iPad Air featuring a mini-LED display, the recent tip is that it will stick with the LCD screen. And there's a chip upgrade on the cards, too, with rumours pointing towards M2 chip being powering the new Air models.Apple isn't just focusing on the iPads themselves; the company is also expected to unveil some new accessories. The Apple Pencil is rumoured to receive a significant upgrade. The new version may feature interchangeable magnetic tips, allowing users to switch between drawing and writing experiences quickly. Additionally, there's talk of haptic feedback being incorporated into the new Apple Pencil, adding a new dimension of tactile response to the drawing and writing process.The Magic Keyboard, a popular accessory that transforms the iPad into a laptop-like device, is also expected to get a refresh. Reports indicate that the new version will feature a more durable aluminium construction, providing a sturdier base for typing and working on the go. The trackpad is also rumoured to get a size boost, making navigation and cursor control even more seamless. With these upgrades, the Magic Keyboard could become an even more essential accessory for iPad power users who demand the best in productivity and versatility.While the focus of the ""Let Loose"" event is expected to be on the iPad lineup and its accessories, Apple may have a few more surprises up its sleeve. Some speculate that the company could tease its upcoming AI-powered devices, giving us a glimpse into the future of smart home technology and wearables. There's also a chance that Apple will provide a sneak peek at the next version of iPadOS , which is expected to bring even more productivity features and enhancements to the tablet operating system.","Apple's ""Let Loose"" event is expected to showcase new iPad Pro and iPad Air models, as well as new accessories like the Apple Pencil and Magic Keyboard.

Who controls Facebook users' feed becomes the part of legal battle ground,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/who-controls-facebook-users-feed-becomes-the-part-of-legal-battle-ground/articleshow/109894546.cms,"Can Facebook users control their feeds using external tools

A lawsuit filed against Meta Platforms Inc , the parent company of Facebook, reportedly argues that users have the right to control their feeds — even if it means shutting them off entirely. According to a report in news agency AP, the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University filed the lawsuit on behalf of a professor who wants to create a tool allowing users to unfollow everything on Facebook.This browser extension would essentially empty a user's newsfeed, potentially leading to less overall Facebook use.The lawsuit filed in federal court in California centers on a specific provision of Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, which protects internet companies from liability for content posted on their platforms. However, another clause grants immunity to developers creating tools that filter content users find objectionable. The lawsuit hinges on whether a user's Facebook newsfeed qualifies as objectionable content that users should be able to filter out.The tool, called Unfollow Everything 2.0 , is a browser extension that would let Facebook users unfollow friends, groups and pages and empty their newsfeed — the stream of posts, photos and videos that can keep them scrolling endlessly. The idea is that without this constant, addicting stream of content, people might use it less.“Maybe CDA 230 provides us with this right to build tools to make your experience of Facebook or other social networks better and to give you more control over them,” said Ethan Zuckerman, the professor behind the lawsuit. If successful, this case could pave the way for more user control tools on social media platforms.While Facebook allows manual unfollowing, the process can be tedious for users with many connections. Additionally, the professor aims to study how disabling the newsfeed impacts user experience on Facebook, with user consent required for participation.Social media companies have the right to design their products, according to Ramya Krishnan , a lawyer for the Knight Institute. However, she argues that users also have the right to curate their own experience and block content they deem harmful. This lawsuit challenges the notion that users must accept Facebook ""as is.""","A lawsuit filed against Meta Platforms Inc argues that users have the right to control their feeds.

‘AI not limited to engineering’

At a time when the tech giants like Google and Microsoft are looking at India for experts in AI technology, a report has claimed that the country currently has less than 2,000 senior engineers who can build AI core products.Citing data from specialist staffing firm Xpheno, Moneycontrol reported that the total active accessible Indian talent with the minimum required skills, experience and exposure to core AI is a little under 21,000.Core AI products and services means AI-based apps, tools and platforms, among othersThis comes as IT services companies have said that they have been training thousands of employees in AI skills over the past year.While Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) has said it had trained 350,000 employees in AI skills, Infosys claims that eight out of 10 employees are AI-ready. As per Accenture, it is upskilling 250,000 employees in AI.Another IT firm HCLTech is said to have trained 50,000 employees and Microsoft India had previously announced plans to skill 2 million people in AI by 2025. Nasscom has also claimed that 650,000-700,000 people are trained on AI.According to the report, experts said that there are aspects of AI skilling that fall outside engineering and building core technology.“The (AI) training that people are doing is more mass market,” Jagdish Mitra, a tech veteran and board member of the non-profit National Skill Development Corporation, was quoted as saying.“And that's not what will be valuable. What will be valuable is process-specific, application-specific and industry-specific skilling that will make a difference to how the skills are being used. It has to be more specific, otherwise it's like a man walking around with a hammer trying to find a nail,” Mitra added.","A report has claimed that India has less than 2,000 senior engineers who can build AI core products.

Apple posted double-digit growth in India during the March quarter of 2024 despite an overall 4 percent revenue decline year-over-year.

The company aims to make 25% of its iPhone production in India by 2025 as it seeks to diversify its supply chain and reduce reliance on China.In addition to being bullish on local manufacturing, Apple has also been increasing its retail footprint in India.

A captivating romance can uplift anyone's spirits, and anime has a unique ability to vividly portray these narratives. Over the years, Japanese animation has delivered numerous romantic tales, ranging from light-hearted comedies to deeply emotional dramas.For romance enthusiasts, going through so many anime options can be overwhelming. However, there are several exceptional romance anime series that truly shine above the rest.Here is a curated list of top romance anime series , compiled by Game Rant, along with their respective rankings.Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie stirred mixed reactions upon its debut in Spring 2022, often compared to ""My Dress-Up Darling"" but standing out as a unique slice-of-life anime centred around a charming couple, Shikimori and Yuu Izumi.One distinctive aspect of the series is its portrayal of the main couple already in a relationship, a rarity in anime. While the episodes focus on everyday moments, they paint a wholesome picture of young love with two endearing characters navigating the nuances of romance.Describing Bakemonogatari as a straightforward romance might be a stretch, but this instalment of Monogatari indeed focuses on and highlights the relationship between Koyomi Araragi and Hitagi Senjougahara. Their initial interactions are unconventional, involving a stapler to the face, but Araragi's determination to assist Senjougahara with her curse ultimately brings them closer.Despite the surreal and eccentric nature of Monogatari, the romance between Araragi and Senjougahara is remarkably grounded and healthy. While the series introduces other potential romantic interests, their relationship remains steadfast and central to the narrative.""Sing 'Yesterday' for Me"" presents romance in a refreshingly realistic manner compared to many other anime. The series takes a classic love triangle and steers it in an unexpected direction by the end, resulting in a highly satisfying conclusion that portrays how failed romances can evolve into strong friendships.Directed by Yoshiyuki Fujiwara, known for his work on popular anime like ""Attack on Titan"" and ""Sword Art Online,"" the shift to a show with such a different tone demonstrates his versatility and mastery in storytelling across diverse genres.""My Happy Marriage"" emerged as one of the standout romance anime of Summer 2023, adapted from Akumi Agitogi's novel series. Set in an alternate Meiji Restoration era with supernatural elements, the story follows Miyo, who endures mistreatment from her stepfamily despite her privileged background. Her family arranges her marriage to a notorious military figure known for rejecting wives quickly, with rejection spelling disaster for Miyo. However, Kiyoka surprises everyone by taking an interest in Miyo and becoming incensed by her family's cruelty.The anime delves into the lasting impact of Miyo's abuse, highlighting her struggle to regain self-worth, even with Kiyoka's support. Kiyoka himself is a complex character with hidden motives behind his initial attraction to Miyo, although his feelings for her are genuine.While the romance between Miyo and Kiyoka is heartwarming, ""My Happy Marriage"" falls short in other areas. The supernatural elements can seem disjointed, and the villains are one-dimensional despite being detestable.Based on Fumita Yanagida's popular and finished manga, ""Tomo-chan Is a Girl!"" stood out as one of Winter 2023's most amusing romantic comedies. Tomo and Jun share a close friendship, but Jun sees Tomo strictly as a friend, unaware of her romantic feelings.While romance is central to its characters, ""Tomo-chan Is a Girl!"" leans heavily into comedy. Tomo and Jun's dynamic is charming, and they're supported by entertaining characters like Misuzu and Carol. Despite its comedic tone, the chemistry between Tomo and Jun develops convincingly over the season. Unlike some romance anime, Tomo-chan excels in portraying why its leads are compatible without difficulty.Teen romance anime often dominate the genre, but there are exceptions worth noting. ""Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku"" is primarily a workplace comedy that revolves around two couples: the newly formed pair of Hirotaka Nifuji and Narumi Momose, and the more established couple, Tarou Kabakura and Hanako Koyanagi. The focus remains on Hirotaka and Narumi, with the series emphasising humour over romance, but Tarou and Hanako's relationship is depicted realistically.Despite being childhood friends, Narumi struggles to see Hirotaka as a potential romantic interest, a dynamic that persists throughout the series. The anime's brevity limits the depth of these relationships, but ""Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku"" provides an entertaining journey within its runtime.""Romantic Killer"" cleverly parodies romance and harem anime while paying homage to their core strengths. Anzu, a girl with no interest in boys, is suddenly thrust into a reverse harem scenario by a magical being, disrupting her life of gaming and chocolate consumption. Unamused by her newfound romantic entanglements with unfamiliar guys, Anzu navigates this unconventional situation with scepticism.Primarily a comedy, ""Romantic Killer"" aims to elicit laughter from its audience, often succeeding with its humour rooted in its origins as a shonen manga, characterised by exaggerated facial expressions.Though not always aiming for emotional depth, the anime treats its characters and their relationships seriously. Anzu shines as a compelling lead, and the male characters introduced as potential partners are well-developed. ""Romantic Killer"" offers a delightful blend of humour and romance for those seeking an entertaining and unconventional love story.""The Angel Next Door Spoils Me Rotten"" captivates viewers from the start for several reasons. Firstly, Project No.9's animation is impressive, featuring clean and detailed character designs. Secondly, and most importantly, the main characters exhibit instant chemistry, evident when Amane offers his umbrella to a soaked Mahiru, sparking a connection.Throughout the series, despite the frequent presence of both leads on screen, ""The Angel Next Door Spoils Me Rotten"" effectively delves into their individual personalities while also developing their friendship.Rumiko Takahashi is celebrated as a legendary mangaka, known for classics like Inuyasha, Ranma 1/2, and Urusei Yatsura. While most of her renowned works fall within the shonen genre, Takahashi has also ventured into seinen storytelling. Maison Ikkoku stands out as one of her most mature works, emphasising romance as its primary theme.Unlike Takahashi's prominent shonen series that explore various genres such as comedy and action alongside romance, Maison Ikkoku focuses squarely on romantic elements, enriched with drama, character development, and humour.The central relationship features Kyouko and Yuusaku, both drawn to each other but hindered by their circumstances. Kyouko, grieving the recent loss of her husband, is hesitant to move forward. Meanwhile, Yuusaku, deeply in love with Kyouko, doubts his worthiness as a student. The anime chronicles their journeys of growth, healing, and mutual misunderstanding, complemented by well-developed secondary characters.Insomniacs After School emerged as the standout romance of Spring 2023, adapted from Makoto Ojiro's esteemed seinen manga. The story revolves around two students plagued by insomnia, a burden they carried alone until they met at their school's observatory. Isaki and Ganta form an immediate bond, which deepens as they work together to revive the Astronomy Club, driven by their shared need to preserve their newfound sanctuary.The anime boasts impeccable pacing, skillfully depicting the protagonists' isolation due to insomnia and the subtle solace they find in each other. While romance is a central theme, the series prioritises developing Ganta and Isaki's friendship before advancing their relationship, emphasising the depth of their connection beyond shared circumstances.Kokoro Connect injects a supernatural twist into a classic love triangle scenario. The story centers around Taichi, Iori, Yui, Yoshifumi, and Himeko, students of the Student Cultural Research Club, whose lives take a turn when they receive supernatural abilities from a mysterious being named Heartseed.As they grapple with these newfound powers, the group experiences sensory phenomena that challenge their relationships and reveal hidden aspects of their personalities. The anime is rich in character development, providing an engaging and thought-provoking experience.Maid Sama! carries many tropes that might derail other romance anime: an overly perfect male lead, a strong female protagonist reduced to a damsel, and an unnecessary love triangle. Despite these shortcomings, Maid Sama! shines through its strong personality.The heart of Maid Sama! lies in the relationship between Takumi Usui, a charming heartthrob, and Misaki Ayuzawa, a strict student council president with a busy schedule balancing school, home, and work. When Takumi discovers Misaki's secret job at a maid cafe, it opens a new perspective on the usually composed president.In ""Rascal Does Not Dream Of Bunny Girl Senpai,"" romance plays a subtle yet compelling role that defines the series. The story centers on Sakuta Azusagawa, a high school student drawn to girls suffering from Adolescence Syndrome, a condition linked to their insecurities.While the anime unfolds through different arcs focusing on various girls, the standout is the initial saga featuring Mai Sakurajima, an actress who forms a close bond with Sakuta. Their dynamic crackles with romantic tension, warmth, and clever banter. Although not always in the foreground, their relationship develops steadily across subsequent arcs, leading to a satisfying sequel in the form of a feature film.Wakana Gojou and Marin Kitagawa inhabit completely contrasting worlds. Gojou, isolated and reserved, keeps himself apart from others due to his passion for hina dolls, fearing ridicule. In contrast, Kitagawa is popular, outgoing, and self-assured.Despite their differences, Kitagawa becomes intrigued by cosplay and sees Gojou as the ideal person to create outfits for her. ""My Dress-Up Darling"" is a charming, humorous, and beautifully animated romance anime that excels in executing classic genre tropes with finesse.""Toradora!"" is a beloved slice-of-life romantic comedy that offers a wonderful entry point into the genre. The story revolves around Ryuji Yusaku and Taiga Aisaka, two students who have crushes on each other's best friends.Both Ryuji and Taiga are viewed as outcasts—Ryuji due to his intimidating appearance and Taiga because of her fiery temper. They team up to assist each other in their romantic pursuits. The series delves into their evolving dynamic and the humorous mishaps that ensue as they navigate their intertwined love lives.""The Pet Girl of Sakurasou"" depicts the journey of an eccentric group of characters as they navigate growth and self-discovery. Sorata Kanda is forced to move into the unconventional Sakura House after being kicked out of his school's main dorms.In Sakura House, Sorata encounters talented yet troubled students. When a peculiar young artist joins the dorm, Sorata takes on the responsibility of helping her adjust to her new life. The series delves into the interactions among the dorm mates, their personal aspirations, and the interconnected nature of their relationships.""Ouran High School Host Club"" is a delightful reverse harem anime filled with lighthearted and meaningful moments. Haruhi Fujioka accidentally breaks an antique vase belonging to her school's Host Club and must repay her debt by disguising herself as a boy and working as a host.The series excels in developing Haruhi's character along with her fellow hosts, providing insight into their motivations and personalities. It's a must-watch for shojo fans, featuring a memorable cast of characters that carries the show through its run.Kyoto Animation has produced many beloved anime, and ""Love, Chunibyo & Other Delusions!"" is among them. The series centers around a phenomenon known as Chunibyo, where adolescents have grandiose and unrealistic delusions.Yuta Togashi, who has outgrown his delusional phase, aims for a normal high school life. However, things take a turn when his classmate, Rikka Takanashi, reminds him of his past and tries to pull him back into the world of Chunibyo with her own delusions. The series delves into their relationship as Yuta unravels the triggers behind Rikka's delusions.The trope of opposites attracting may be overused, but when done well, it can lead to a captivating romantic comedy. ""Kimi ni Todoke"" explores the endearing friendship between the shy Sawako Kuronuma and the popular Shouta Kazehaya. Sawako, often mistaken for Sadako from ""The Ring,"" is isolated at school due to her appearance, making it challenging for her to break out of her shell. Fortunately, Kazehaya is just the right person to help her.""Kimi ni Todoke"" is a delightful and heartwarming anime with well-developed characters who evolve as the story unfolds. While it adheres to typical romance anime pacing, the journey remains engaging and enjoyable.Unlike most romance stories that focus on the process of falling in love, ""Tonikawa: Over The Moon For You"" follows a married couple who have already reached that point. As a result, the anime adopts a slice-of-life approach, showcasing Nasa and Tsukasa's daily life and antics rather than a typical romantic journey. ""Tonikawa"" doesn't rely on dramatic highs but instead offers a pleasant and light-hearted experience.While this anime may not appeal to everyone, it serves as a refreshing departure from more melodramatic romance shows. Despite their tendency to blush at the slightest physical contact, Nasa and Tsukasa are refreshingly direct in expressing their feelings, making them both witty and likeable characters.This romantic anime shines because of its main character, Takeo Gouda. His towering, imposing presence contrasts beautifully with his heartfelt affection for the delicate Rinko, which is truly heartwarming. Takeo's efforts to play matchmaker for Rinko with his best friend, despite his own feelings, demonstrate his genuine kindness.Viewers will undoubtedly root for Takeo and Rinko's endearing relationship. ""My Love Story!!"" delivers the goods without delay, as the main characters are dating for most of the episodes, bypassing the typical slow build-up to a confession.""A Sign of Affection"" is a heartwarming romantic comedy centred on college-age love and the challenges of communication. While not the sole focus of the story, Yuki and Itsuomi stand out as the main couple, instantly captivating viewers. Yuki, who is hearing-impaired, communicates using sign language, text, and by reading lips, while Itsuomi is a world traveller passionate about learning languages. Their connection begins on a train and grows stronger with each subsequent encounter.The anime beautifully captures the intense emotions of falling in love, highlighted by a poignant moment in the opening episode. With an older cast, ""A Sign of Affection"" takes on a more mature tone compared to typical romance anime. Throughout the season, Yuki and Itsuomi become increasingly comfortable around each other, resulting in consistently endearing interactions.This romantic anime is ideal for LGBTQ+ viewers seeking representation on screen, but its well-crafted storytelling makes it enjoyable for all audiences. The heartwarming romance blossoms between Mafuyu and Ritsuka as Mafuyu learns to play guitar and sing in Ritsuka's band.Watching Mafuyu's growing confidence alongside the romantic tension creates a compelling series that's hard to resist. The accompanying movie is also outstanding and a must-watch continuation of the series.Nana is one of the most renowned and beloved shoujo anime of all time, a must-watch for fans of romance and beyond. The series follows two women named Nana, seemingly different but navigating curiously similar life situations that lead to separate outcomes.Without giving away how their stories intertwine, Nana's 47 episodes delve into the protagonists' perspectives on love through various relationships. Grounded in reality, the anime explores complex characters who, despite occasional extremes, face accountability for their actions.Your Lie in April, one of the most famous romance anime, revolves around two music prodigies: Kousei Arima and Kaori Miyazono. Kousei, grappling with depression after his mother's death, loses his passion for the piano and withdraws from the performance arts. One day, he hears Kaori playing her violin with such freedom that it reignites his love for music and sparks his admiration for her.The anime delves into themes of grief, life, love, and music. Kousei's journey toward self-healing is profound, marked by heartbreak, but also punctuated by moments of beauty, tenderness, and joy.In this anime, Miyuki and Kaguya engage in a battle of wits to avoid confessing their love first, using their intellect and skills to outmaneuver each other. Both are determined not to be seen as the one who gives in.Their antics running the student council at an elite school with their friends are uproariously funny yet also contain heartwarming moments that will make viewers cheer. Season 3 of Kaguya-sama: Love is War, which aired in Spring 2022, leaned heavily into comedy but also devoted more time to developing Miyuki and Kaguya's relationship and touching on other romances.If the anime follows the manga, the next season of Love is War promises to be predominantly romantic. If successful, this upcoming release could elevate Kaguya-sama to the pinnacle of romance anime.This anime consists of two parts: Clannad and After Story. The latter surpasses the former by a wide margin, but watching Clannad is essential to fully appreciate the impact of After Story. While it features a diverse cast of supporting characters, the heart of the show revolves around Tomoya Okazaki and Nagisa Furukawa, delivering a profound narrative.Unlike typical romance series, Clannad After Story unfolds beyond high school, depicting the growth of Tomoya and Nagisa as individuals and as a couple. The anime tackles real-life challenges without glossing over them, offering a genuine exploration of common struggles.The Dangers in My Heart is truly brilliant. At first glance, it may seem like another typical shounen romance where a popular girl falls for an ordinary loner guy. These stories often offer little beyond wish fulfilment, and The Dangers in My Heart initially appears to fit that mould. Yet, the anime stands out.Ichikawa is an average guy with few friends who daydreams about unusual things. While the anime doesn't delve deeply into these thoughts, it doesn't ignore them either, leaving Ichikawa with a poor first impression. On the other hand, Anna is a cheerful but shy girl who loves food and works as a model. After a chance encounter at the school library, the two start spending time together, developing a friendship that hints at something deeper. Anna encourages Ichikawa to break out of his shell, leading to significant changes in him over the course of two seasons.Although slow-paced initially, The Dangers in My Heart evolves into something special by the end of season 1, maintaining its momentum in the subsequent cour and establishing itself as one of the best romance anime of all time. Anna and Ichikawa are both exceptional characters, but Anna's depth is what elevates the show. She's not just an idealised plot device; she's a fully realised character with insecurities, quirks, and vulnerabilities. Her interest in Ichikawa feels genuine, and vice versa. This is a rare quality in romance anime.Fruits Basket is the definitive romance anime, masterfully blending drama and comedy. Tooru Honda, a lovable protagonist, faces life's challenges until she moves in with the Souma family. The Soumas, particularly Yuki, are school idols hiding a shocking secret that alters perceptions.Love triangles often lack depth, favouring one partner over the other. Fruits Basket defies this norm with its compelling love triangle, where each character is fully developed. Across three seasons, Fruits Basket takes viewers on an unforgettable journey.Also read | 15 best anime series of all time; here's the list","Japanese animation has delivered numerous romantic tales, ranging from light- hearted comedies to deeply emotional dramas.
