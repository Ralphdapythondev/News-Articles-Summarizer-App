Ola Electric comes under govt scrutiny

Ola Electric has bought in consulting services firm EY India to spearhead a ‘ service transformation ’ in response to growing after-sales service challenges, increasing customer complaints, and falling sales volumes, ET reports. Quoting sources familiar with the matter, the report said that about a dozen executives from EY came on-board at Ola Electric a few weeks ago on deputation for the three-month project.They are expected to provide guidance across various service-related areas, including optimizing business processes and improving spare parts inventory management for the Bhavish Aggarwal electric vehicle maker. The project’s tenure, it says, can be extended depending on the outcome.“EY is helping Ola in streamlining the business processes, inventory management of spare parts and improving an on-ground presence in places where it has sales but no service,” the report cited a source. Aggarwal is closely involved in the whole process with the team, the person said.Earlier this month, the Central Consumer Protection Authority issued a show cause notice to Ola Electric for alleged violation of consumer rights, misleading advertisement and unfair trade practices. The show-cause notice points to user complaints such as manufacturing defects, partial or no refunds on booking cancellations, recurring defects despite servicing, overcharging, inaccurate invoices, and multiple issues with batteries and vehicle components.Last week, the Ministry of Heavy Industries (MHI) directed the Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI) to provide detailed inputs regarding consumer complaints against the EV maker.Ola Electric has been grappling with increased customer complaints over after-sales service. As per National Consumer Helpline data 10,644 complaints against Ola e-scooters were received from September 1, 2023, to August 30, 2024. Of these, 3,389 relate to service delays, 1,899 pertain to delays in the delivery of new vehicles, and 1,459 involve unfulfilled promised services.","Ola Electric has bought in consulting services firm EY India to spearhead a ‘ service transformation ’ The move is in response to growing after-sales service challenges, increasing customer complaints, and falling sales volumes.

As India-Canada ties worsen, memes went viral on social media. Here are some of the viral ones:

Government on Canada's allegations

The diplomatic crisis between India and Canada deepened as Ottawa accused New Delhi of involvement in the killing of a Sikh separatist, Hardeep Singh Nijjar . Canada hinted at possible sanctions against India and claimed to have evidence linking Indian government agents to the killing. The Canadian government also alleged ties between the Bishnoi gang and Indian government agents, accusing them of carrying out covert operations and violent activities in Canada.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau blamed India for ""targeted campaign against Canadian citizens by agents linked to the government of India"" with his British counterpart, Keir Starmer . In response to the escalating tensions, Canadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly did not rule out imposing sanctions on India, stating that ""everything is on the table.""India vehemently rejected Canada's accusations, denying any involvement in the Sikh leader's killing or any other criminal activities in the country. Official sources in India stated that Canada's claim of sharing evidence in the Nijjar case was false.Prime Minister Trudeau's allegations that India was engaging in covert operations targeting Canadian nationals were also dismissed by Indian authorities. At a press conference, Trudeau accused India of threatening and killing Canadian citizens on Canadian soil, vowing that Canada would not tolerate such actions.In retaliation for Canada's accusations, India expelled six Canadian diplomats and withdrew its high commissioner from Canada. This move came after India dismissed Ottawa's allegations linking the Indian envoy to the investigation into Nijjar's killing.","The diplomatic crisis between India and Canada deepened as Ottawa accused New Delhi of involvement in the killing of a Sikh separatist, Hardeep Singh Nijjar.

"Telecom minister makes it clear: Spectrum for satcom will be allocated administratively, but not 'free'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/telecom-minister-makes-it-clear-spectrum-for-satcom-will-be-allocated-administratively-but-not-free/articleshow/114259102.cms,"What concerns do Jio and Airtel have

Musk calls auction “unprecedented”

Telecom Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia on October 15 clarified the government’s stand on the satcom spectrum issue. He said that spectrum will not be auctioned but allocated administratively and service providers will have to pay a cost.“The Telecom Act 2023 which was passed in December of last year has very clearly put this in Schedule 1 which means that satcom spectrum will be allocated administratively,” Scindia said at India Mobile Congress while responding to a question at a media briefing.According to a report by news agency PTI, Scindia, however, he made it clear that radiowaves will come with a cost even if assigned without auction for satellite-based communications services.“That does not mean that spectrum comes without a cost. What that cost is and what the formula of that cost is going to be will not be decided by you and me but it will be decided by Trai,” he added.“We have a regulatory authority for telecom and that regulatory authority has been empowered by the constitution to determine what that administrative pricing is going to be? I am very confident that they will come up with the best pricing that should be adopted provided that it is being given in an administrative manner,” Scindia added.The development essentially means that the demand of Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel and service providers to auction satcom spectrum has been rejected. Scindia’s comments come hours after Bharti Airtel founder and chairman Sunil Bharti Mittal joined rival Reliance Jio in seeking allocation of spectrum for satcom services in the same manner as it is allocated to telecom players.Both the telecom giants have sought a fair and transparent auction system for satellite services to ensure level competition.Reliance Jio has called for a revised approach to spectrum allocation for satellite communication companies in India. In a letter dated October 10 to Telecom Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia, Jio urged a reconsideration of the current proposal, citing concerns about fair competition with established telecom operators.Elon Musk's Starlink , Amazon's Kupier, Bharti Group-backed OneWeb Eutelsat, and SES-Jio joint venture have expressed interest to provide their services in India, which will directly compete with land based mobile networks.Jio emphasised that satellite companies like Starlink and Amazon's Kuiper should acquire spectrum through a transparent auction process, similar to traditional telecom players – pay licensing fees, mirroring the obligations of existing telecom providers.Sunil Mittal, chairman of Bharti Airtel, echoed this sentiment at the India Mobile Congress, stating that satellite companies offering services in urban areas should participate in spectrum auctions. Airtel also reiterated its stand and shared a letter it wrote to the telecom department in March.On October 14, Musk reacted to Reliance Jio’s reported move to urge the government for transparent auction for satellite spectrum.“That would be unprecedented, as this spectrum was long designated by the ITU [International Telecommunication Union] as [a] shared spectrum for satellites,” Musk said.Scindia spoke on similar lines that satellite spectrum across the world is allocated administratively.“India is not doing anything different from the rest of the world. Conversely, if you do decide to auction then you are doing something which is different from the rest of the world,” he said“Satellite spectrum is a very high level of spectrum beyond 7-8 Ghz is shared spectrum. If spectrum is shared then how can you price it individually? I think there are a number of issues that go into decision making which is why globally all countries of the world are following a certain model and India is doing pretty much the same,” the minister added.",Telecom Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia on October 15 clarified the government’s stand on the satcom spectrum issue.

The deliberations remain fluid, and no final decisions have been made.This development comes on the heels of a recent Commerce Department rule that could ease AI chip shipments to data centres in the Middle East. The new rule allows data centers to apply for Validated End User status, enabling them to receive chips under a general authorization rather than requiring individual licences.Last year, the US government extended licensing requirements for advanced chip exports to over 40 countries, including some in the Middle East, citing risks of diversion to China and arms embargo considerations.The potential new restrictions would further tighten controls on the global distribution of cutting-edge AI technology. Nvidia and AMD, two of the world's leading AI chip manufacturers, could see their international sales affected if the proposal moves forward.Neither the US Commerce Department nor Nvidia provided comments on the matter when approached by Reuters. Intel and AMD have not yet responded to requests for comment.","The Biden administration is reportedly exploring options to limit the export of advanced artificial intelligence chips to specific countries.

China's cybersecurity agency has refuted claims by the US and Microsoft that Chinese hackers were responsible for the “Volt Typhoon” hacking on critical American infrastructure, a report has said. China has claimed the US has deployed “cyber warfare forces” for network penetration.Citing a report by China’s National Computer Virus Emergency Response Center, Bloomberg said that the agency called the accusations a “political farce” orchestrated by Washington.The report by the Chinese agency also asserted that over 50 international cybersecurity experts found insufficient evidence to link the attack to China.It also claimed that US intelligence agencies have deployed “cyber warfare forces” for reconnaissance and network penetration. The agency said that the US uses tools like “Marble” to mislead investigators and falsely implicate China.This is the third time this year that China has denied involvement with the Volt Typhoon .Volt Typhoon is a hacking group that was identified by Microsoft in 2023, and it allegedly infiltrated US industrial networks for years. This year, the US government joined Microsoft in warning against the Chinese state-sponsored hacking group saying it had been embedded into US industrial networks for at least five years.In April, FBI Director Christopher Wray said that this hacking group has compromised companies in vital sectors like telecommunications, energy, and water, including access to 23 pipeline operators. In a strong warning, Wray said that Chinese government-linked hackers are waiting “for just the right moment to deal a devastating blow.”The FBI claimed that the hackers use a network of compromised computers worldwide, known as botnets, to hide their activities. Apart from Microsoft, researchers from Google have also previously linked Volt Typhoon to China.",China's cybersecurity agency has refuted claims by the US and Microsoft that Chinese hackers were responsible for the “Volt Typhoon” hacking on critical American infrastructure. The agency called the accusations a “political farce” orchestrated by Washington.

Tesla showcased its latest innovations, including the Cybercab and Robovan prototypes, at the ""We, Robot"" event in Los Angeles. The unveiling, however, did not meet market expectations, resulting in a 9% decline in Tesla's stock the following day. This drop led to a $15 billion decrease in CEO Elon Musk 's net worth, bringing it down to $240 billion, as reported by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index .Despite this setback, Musk remains the world's wealthiest individual.Investors and Wall Street analysts were largely disappointed with the event, citing a lack of concrete details about Tesla’s self-driving vehicle strategy. Adam Jonas, a Morgan Stanley analyst, expressed dissatisfaction with the presentation's substance, highlighting concerns about the absence of specific timelines for product launches and details on Tesla's autonomous vehicle development.The primary attractions at the event were the Cybercab, which Elon Musk announced would debut ""before 2027,"" and the Robovan, capable of seating 20 passengers. Yet, no exact release date was provided for the Robovan. Also featured were demonstrations of Tesla's humanoid robots, named Optimus, which showcased various capabilities such as dancing and pouring drinks.Tesla's stock experienced a sharp drop following the event, marking the most significant decline since the company postponed the event initially scheduled for August. Although the stock had rebounded somewhat in September, it has yet to return to the year-to-date high reached in July. The recent decline further intensified scrutiny over Tesla's direction and ability to deliver on its ambitious goals.In response to the market's reaction, Musk took to social media to affirm Tesla's long-term vision, emphasising the company’s leadership in technology and innovation. He cited a statement by Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, which described Tesla as being ""at the forefront of the 4th Industrial Revolution."" Despite Musk's positive outlook, investors continued to express concerns over the lack of detailed roadmaps for the company’s autonomous vehicles.Tesla has been actively working towards developing fully autonomous vehicles, which it sees as a pivotal part of its future growth. However, the ""We, Robot"" event left investors wanting more specific details on the timeline and functionality of these vehicles. The Cybercab’s projected release ""before 2027"" was the only indication of Tesla's plans for self-driving products. The Robovan, although an intriguing concept, also lacked a clear launch schedule, leaving questions about its commercial availability.Tesla had encountered challenges earlier in the year when the ""We, Robot"" event was postponed from August. The stock's recent performance reflects continued volatility, influenced by the company's ambitious projects and market uncertainties. The company's shares had been steadily recovering from the initial postponement but faced renewed pressure following the event’s perceived shortcomings.","Tesla showcased its latest innovations, including the Cybercab and Robovan prototypes, at the ""We, Robot"" event in Los Angeles.

"Satcom spectrum allocation: Airtel says no change in stand, shares this letter sent to telecom ministry in March 2024",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/satcom-spectrum-allocation-airtel-says-no-change-in-stand-shares-this-letter-sent-to-telecom-ministry-in-march-2024/articleshow/114250598.cms,"What Airtel has to say

Airtel, as India's leading mobile telecom operator, has always supported the ushering in of satcom services to connect the uncovered areas in the deep far-flung reaches of the nation for maritime services, aviation, our defence and security needs as also for disaster recovery activities.

Even six months back, Airtel had written a letter to DoT (enclosed). Therefore, there is no question of Airtel having moved its stance.

Airtel has always maintained that it will use all technologies including satcom to ensure that every nook and corner of the country is covered for high-speed broadband connectivity. This position remains consistent. Airtel has tied up with

Eutelsat OneWeb

, which has a LEO constellation, only the second one in the world, through which it proposes to provide satcom services in India and Africa. Eutelsat OneWeb, in Joint Venture with Airtel, has already set up two ground stations, one in Gujarat and the other in Tamil Nadu, to secure all communications arising out of India on the satcom network as it awaits the green light to commercially provide such services.

Satellite operators who want to provide services to urban areas and retail customers indeed need to go through the regular licensing process of any country, and in this case, India, to obtain a license; buy the spectrum; undertake all the obligations, including rollout and security; pay their license fees and taxes and they would be welcomed by the telecom fraternity. Therefore, mobile operators and satcom operators, who have worked in harmony for decades, can continue to do so to serve those who are still struggling to find internet connectivity.

What Bharti Airtel’s letter to the telecom department said

Dear Sir,

Airtel has always been at the forefront of bringing digital revolution and digital inclusion in the country, and is appreciative of various initiatives taken by the Government for fostering the same.

As a pan India terrestrial network operator, we understand the techno-commercial challenges that networks face in connecting the unconnected/rural/remote areas or maritime and aviation as also in situations of disaster management. This is where we acknowledge the potential of satellite communication (SATCOM) complementing the terrestrial networks–in bridging this digital inclusion gap.

Apropos, the recently released Telecommunications Act, 2023 has rightly included SATCOM in its ambit while assigning spectrum for SATCOM on an administrative basis. We continue to strongly support this approach.

SATCOM will act as a complementary service to terrestrial communication services in bridging digital inclusion gap and/or servicing the specific use cases of non-retail customers such as defense, cellular backhaul or in rural and remote areas.

Accordingly assignment of satellite spectrum on administrative basis can be done for such use cases. The only exception may be created for unhindered use by any government agency and for disaster management in any part of the country.

Since the DoT is in the process of framing rules under the Telecom Act, we sincerely believe that the above understanding will appropriately reflect in the rules for SATCOM.

We hope our above submission will be considered favorably.

Thanking you,

Yours Sincerely,

For Bharti Airtel Limited

Rahul Vatts

Chief Regulatory Officer

Hours after Telecom czar Sunil Bharti Mittal joined his rival Mukesh Ambani-led Jio to advocate for a level playing field in the satellite broadband sector, Airtel has issued a statement on satcom spectrum allocation, referring to a letter it sent to the Department of Telecom (DoT) in March 2024. Airtel says that satellite companies should be required to pay licensing fees and acquire spectrum through auctions, just as traditional telecom operators do.Airtel sent a letter to the Chairman, DCC & Secretary (T), Department of Telecommunications, on March 29 on “Assignment of Spectrum for Satellite Communication Services”, signed by Rahul Vatts, chief regulatory officer at Airtel.","Bharti Airtel says satellite companies should be required to pay licensing fees and acquire spectrum through auctions, just as traditional telecom operators do.

Aakash Educational Services Limited (AESL) has reportedly shut down its digital classroom program, the Aakash Digital Classroom Program (AD-CRP). This development comes amidst recent layoffs at the company.As reported by Deccan Herald, AD-CRP team, previously part of Byju's (which acquired Aakash in April 2021) has now been integrated into Aakash's sales system.This move suggests a shift in strategy, with Aakash prioritising its offline presence and expanding its physical branch network.Earlier reports in August and September documented layoffs at Aakash, impacting both senior and middle management along with some long-term employees. The remaining members of the AD-CRP team were either absorbed into Aakash's call centre model or offered positions in their offline branches. Those who declined these offers were laid off or resigned.This restructuring highlights a potential change in Aakash's approach to test preparation . While the company continues to offer online resources , the recent layoffs and program closure suggest a focus on strengthening their physical infrastructure and sales network .Students who had enrolled in the AD-CRP program may face challenges due to the sudden shutdown.

"Elon Musk 'joins' Reliance Jio, Airtel vs Amazon, Starlink and other BIF members fight on satellite spectrum",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/elon-musk-joins-reliance-jio-airtel-vs-amazon-starlink-and-other-bif-members-fight-on-satellite-spectrum/articleshow/114248115.cms,"Why Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel are in asking for spectrum auction

Starlink CEO Elon Musk seems to have joined the telecom companies vs Broadband Federation of India ( BIF ) fight over satellite communication spectrum. In a recent letter to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai), Reliance Jio sought revision of the consultation paper on recommending rules for ""terms and conditions for the assignment of spectrum for certain satellite-based commercial communication services"".Jio has argued that the current paper fails to ensure a level playing field between satellite and terrestrial services.BIF strongly opposed Reliance Jio's plea for a revised consultation paper on satellite communication spectrum rules. ""This seems to be a direct defiance of the Telecommunications Act passed by the highest legislative authority of the country Parliament and a reprehensible attempt to undermine the country's extant policy framework,"" BIF said. BIF members include Amazon, Microsoft, OneWeb, Samsung, TCS, BSNL and Ericsson.Last week, Jio sent a letter to communications minister Jyotiraditya Scindia urging the telecom ministry to conduct a transparent auction for satellite spectrum and revise the Trai’s consultation paper to ensure a level playing field between satellite and terrestrial networks.Responding to a tweet on a news report that said Reliance Jio is challenging the administrative allocation of spectrum to Starlink by Trai saying that satellite broadband spectrum should be auctioned (not allocated) because foreign players like Starlink could compete with local LTE players by offering voice and data services; Musk termed it “unprecedented and violation of ITU rules.“That would be unprecedented, as this spectrum was long designated by the ITU [International Telecommunication Union] as [a] shared spectrum for satellites,” Musk said in reply to a post.The dispute stems from a disagreement over how India should assign spectrum for satellite services. While Starlink and other global players advocate for administrative allocation, viewing spectrum as a shared natural resource, the top Indian telecom giants – Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel – favour an auction process for a level playing field.According to Reliance Jio, since terrestrial networks acquire spectrum through auctions, a similar process should be adopted for satellite services to ensure fair competition. Reliance asserts that the current regulatory approach, which favours allocation, is flawed and lacks proper industry consultation.Jio contends that foreign satellite providers may potentially offer voice and data services, competing with traditional telecom players, thus necessitating an auction.Meanwhile, Airtel too supports arch rival Reliance Jio’s stand on this. Speaking at the inaugural day of India Mobile Congress 2024, Bharti Airtel chairman Sunil Mittal said, “Telecom companies around the globe have done seminal work in connecting the world. They will take the satellite services into the remotest parts of the nations through the USO program and directly through themselves.”“The satellite companies who have ambitions to come into urban areas serving elite retail customers just need to take the telecom licences like everybody with the same conditions and will have to buy the spectrum and pay licence fees as the telecom players,” he added.","Starlink CEO Elon Musk seems to have joined the telecom companies vs Broadband Federation of India fight over satellite communication spectrum.

The division was revised earlier this year when Apple opened its App Store for retro game emulators, coinciding with antitrust probes in the European Union . But this wasn’t Apple’s position on game emulators. Co-founder and former CEO Steve Jobs once unveiled a PlayStation emulator for the Mac at one of the company's events.An emulator allows a computer system (the host) to imitate the functions of another (the guest). With the help of an emulator, a host system can run software and programs, like a game which are designed for the guest system.A video of Steve Jobs is also available on YouTube on “NeoGamer - The Video Game Archive” channel.Back in 1999 at the Macworld Expo, Apple was set to unveil upgrades to the iMac G3 and introduce the new Power Mac G3. Throughout the event, Steve Jobs emphasized the Mac's gaming capabilities. On stage, Jobs and Phil Schiller presented Connectix's Virtual Game Station (VGS) – the first PlayStation emulator with the ability to run games at full speed on any platform. The Mac was slated to receive VGS before any other system.VGS was then priced at $49 and was officially compatible only with original PlayStation game CDs. To showcase this achievement, Schiller gave a live demonstration during the keynote, playing an emulated version of Crash Bandicoot: Warped.As mentioned above, Apple updated its App Store rules in April 2024 to allow emulators for retro console games across the globe. The Cupertino-based tech giant then said that it will also offer its users an option to download titles from these emulators.","When Steve Jobs unveiled a PS1 emulator for the Mac in 1999, Apple's stance on console game emulators has evolved over time.

Tips to stay safe:

A cybercrime incident in Bengaluru has highlighted the growing threat of sophisticated scams targeting unsuspecting individuals. According to a report by Deccan Herald, a 29-year-old businessman fell victim to a telecom and CBI impersonation scam, losing a staggering Rs 14 lakh.The victim received a call on September 25th from an individual claiming to be from the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI).The caller accused the victim of being linked to illegal activities, including money laundering.After Pareek repeatedly informed the caller that it wasn't his phone number, the caller transferred the call to the ""CBI office in Mumbai."" The new caller then claimed to be a CBI officer but refused to disclose his identity.Scammers then employed a tactic known as "" digital arrest "" to manipulate the victim further. They claimed an HDFC bank account, allegedly opened in his name, had been used for a suspicious $6 million (60 lakh) transaction. They further threatened him with constant surveillance, creating a sense of urgency and fear.To add to the legitimacy of the scam, the fraudsters reportedly instructed the victim to download the Signal messaging app for a ""video statement,"" a tactic often seen in digital arrest scams. Following this, they pressured him to transfer 80% of his bank balance to a supposedly secure ""RBI account"" for verification.The victim then transferred a total of Rs 14.57 lakh between September 25th and October 2nd. The deceit only came to light when he reported the incident to authorities on October 3rd, leading to a registered case and investigation.- Do not share personal information or transfer funds based on unsolicited calls or messages.- Verify information directly with the concerned organisation, not through phone numbers provided by the caller.- Be cautious of tactics that create a sense of urgency or fear.- Report suspicious incidents to the authorities immediately.","A 29-year-old businessman fell victim to a telecom and CBI impersonation scam, losing a staggering Rs 14 lakh.
