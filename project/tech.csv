Safety measures in GPT-4o mini

Sam Altman-led OpenAI has launched a new cost-efficient small AI model . Dubbed GPT-4o mini , it is 60% cheaper than GPT-3.5 Turbo. GPT 4o-mini is priced at 15 cents per million input tokens and 60 cents per million output tokens.In a press release, the Microsoft-backed company said that the new GPT-4o mini can outperform GPT-41 on chat preferences in LMSYS leaderboard.It scored 82% on Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU), OpenAI said.OpenAI’s GPT-4o mini enables a broad range of tasks, such as applications that chain or parallelize multiple model calls (e.g., calling multiple APIs), pass a large volume of context to the model (e.g., full code base or conversation history), or interact with customers through fast, real-time text responses (e.g., customer support chatbots).Currently, GPT-4o mini supports text and vision in the API. The company plans to add support for text, image, video and audio inputs and outputs in the future.According to OpenAI, GPT 4o-mini scored 87.0%, compared to 75.5% for Gemini Flash and 71.7% for Claude Haiku in math reasoning. Similarly, GPT-4o mini scored 87.2% on HumanEval, which measures coding performance, compared to 71.5% for Gemini Flash and 75.9% for Claude Haiku.GPT-4o mini is available as a text and vision model in the Assistants API, Chat Completions API, and Batch API. Developers pay 15 cents per 1M input tokens and 60 cents per 1M output tokens (roughly the equivalent of 2500 pages in a standard book).In ChatGPT , Free, Plus and Team users will be able to access GPT-4o mini starting today, in place of GPT-3.5. Enterprise users will also have access starting next week.OpenAI says that the GPT-4o mini has the same safety mitigations built-in as GPT-4o. More than 70 external experts in fields like social psychology and misinformation tested GPT-4o to identify potential risks. Insights from these expert evaluations, the company says, have helped improve the safety of both GPT-4o and GPT-4o mini.",GPT-4o mini can outperform GPT-41 on chat preferences in LMSYS leaderboard.

WazirX vs Binance

Mumbai-based crypto exchange WazirX has halted withdrawals from the platform after suffering a major hacking attack . India's biggest crypto exchange confirmed the same in a statement on X, formerly Twitter. WazirX saw withdrawals in early European hours on Thursday (July 18). WazirX, which popularly calls itself as 'India Ka Bitcoin Exchange', primarily targets the Indian market.It is said to be among the few Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) registered exchanges in the country, allowing it to offer crypto exchange services to Indian citizens.The company called the security breach a “force majeure event” that has reportedly resulted in the loss of $230 million. “This is a force majeure event beyond our control, but we are leaving no stone unturned to locate and recover the funds. We have already blocked a few deposits and reached out to concerned wallets for recovery. We are in touch with the best resources to help us in this endeavor,” WazirX said in a statement posted on its X account.“The cyber attack stemmed from a discrepancy between the data displayed on Liminal’s interface and the transaction’s actual contents,” said WazirX in a statement on Thursday. “During the cyber attack, there was a mismatch between the information displayed on Liminal’s interface and what was actually signed. We suspect the payload was replaced to transfer wallet control to an attacker.”Reports suggest that the platform has lost about $230 million. What makes the amount of missing assets significant for WazirX is that the company reported holdings of about $500 million in its June proof-of-reserves disclosure. This means that WazirX has lost almost half its reserves. According to Cyvers estimate, the amount lost from the multiple-signature wallet on WazirX would be one of the biggest crypto thefts in recent years.Lookchain, a third-party blockchain explorer, reported that more than 200 cryptocurrencies, including 5.43 billion SHIB tokens, over 15,200 Ethereum tokens, 20.5 million Matic tokens, 640 billion Pepe tokens, 5.79 million USDT and 135 million Gala tokens were “stolen” from the platform.CoinSwitch and CoinDCX are the two other leading crypto exchanges in India. The two companies assured their customers that their funds were secure and unaffected by this incident. “Our wallet security remains robust,” Sumit Gupta, co-founder and chief executive of CoinDCX, wrote in a tweet.“We advise all our crypto investors to be mindful of potential market volatility during this time and exercise caution in their trading and investment activities,” tweeted Ashish Singhal, co-founder and chief executive of PeepalCo, the group holding firm of CoinSwitch.According to media reports quoting Blockchain sleuth Elliptic, the North-Korea linked hackers appear to be behind the attack. Leakage of a private key providing access to the wallet reportedly led to the hack. The leaked private keys reportedly are used to upgrade a safe multi-sig wallet, which holds a large number of assets, to a malicious contractIndia's larges crypto platform WazirX separated from global crypto major Binance in early 2023. The two crypto exchanges had a public and high-profile fallout in 2022. Two ownership disputes started two years after Binance announced it had acquired WazirX. Binance founder Changpeng Zhao eventually said that the two firms hadn’t been able to conclude the deal and moved to terminate Binance’s businesses with the Indian firm.",Mumbai-based crypto exchange WazirX has halted withdrawals from the platform after suffering a major hacking attack.

Japanese scientists have achieved a significant milestone by attaching living skin tissue to robotic faces, enabling them to ""smile."" This groundbreaking development, spearheaded by researchers at the University of Tokyo, holds promise for applications in both cosmetics and medicine.A Reuters report states that scientists at the University of Tokyo successfully cultivated human skin cells in the form of a face and used embedded ligament-like attachments to create a wide smile.The result, although slightly uncanny, represents a crucial step towards creating more lifelike robots, according to lead researcher Shoji Takeuchi.""By attaching these actuators and anchors, it became possible to manipulate living skin for the first time,"" Takeuchi explained.The smiling robot , which features in a study published last month in Cell Reports Physical Science, is the culmination of a decade of research by Takeuchi and his team. Their work focuses on integrating biological and artificial components to create more realistic machines.Takeuchi highlighted the numerous advantages of using living tissue over traditional materials like metals and plastics. Living tissue offers energy efficiency comparable to that of brains and muscles and has the inherent ability to repair itself, unlike synthetic materials.Looking ahead, the researchers plan to enhance the lab-grown skin by incorporating additional elements such as a circulatory system and nerves. These developments could pave the way for safer testing platforms for cosmetics and medications that are absorbed through the skin. Moreover, it could result in more realistic and functional coverings for robots.Despite the progress, there remains the challenge of addressing the eerie or unsettling feelings that lifelike machines can evoke. Takeuchi acknowledged the current creepiness factor of the robot but believes that making robots out of human-like materials and enabling them to display human expressions might help overcome the ""uncanny valley"" effect.""There's still a bit of that creepiness to it,"" Takeuchi admitted. ""I think that making robots out of the same materials as humans and having them show the same expressions might be one key to overcoming the uncanny valley.""",Scientists at the University of Tokyo successfully cultivated human skin cells in the form of a face and used embedded ligament-like attachments to create a wide smile.

Bharti Airtel has unveiled new 5G data booster packs for its customers, offering unlimited 5G data for users on 1GB per day and 1.5GB per day plans, which previously did not include this benefit. This initiative follows a similar launch by Reliance Jio and aims to enhance the data experience for Airtel's customer base.Airtel's new booster packs are available in three tiers, priced at Rs 51, Rs 101, and Rs 151.These packs provide additional 3GB, 6GB, and 9GB of 4G data respectively, alongside unlimited 5G data. The booster packs can be activated on existing plans and will share the same validity period as the base plan. For instance, if a customer has a 56-day plan, the booster pack will also be valid for 56 days.Users can add these boosters to their existing plans to access unlimited 5G data, guaranteeing sufficient data for work, study, entertainment, and other activities. The introduction of these boosters aims to offer a seamless and enhanced data experience, particularly for users who rely heavily on data for their daily activities.Airtel's launch of these booster packs closely follows Reliance Jio's introduction of similar plans. Jio's booster packs also provide unlimited 5G data and are similarly priced. However, Jio's plans come with certain limitations, such as incompatibility with specific value plans. Airtel, on the other hand, has not specified any such limitations for its booster packs, potentially offering a more flexible option for users.The launch of these booster packs comes on the heels of recent tariff hikes by both Airtel and Jio, which took effect from July 3. Airtel emphasised the need for a higher Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) to maintain a sustainable business model and continue investing in network technology and spectrum. The revised unlimited voice plans saw tariffs increase from Rs 179 to Rs 199, Rs 455 to Rs 599, and Rs 1,799 to Rs 1,999. Airtel described this as a modest hike, equating to less than 70 paise per day for entry-level plans, to minimise the impact on budget-conscious consumers. Vodafone-Idea (Vi) has also increased prices for its prepaid and postpaid plans.","Airtel's new booster packs are available in three tiers, priced at Rs 51, Rs 101, and Rs 151.

Meta follows Apple’s lead

Facebook parent company Meta has said that it will not launch its upcoming multimodal AI model Llama in the European Union ( EU ). The company said that the region’s regulations have an “unpredictable nature”, making it the second big technology company after Apple to make such a decision.This means that European companies and users will not be able to use the multimodal model – which is capable of using video, audio, images and text to generate responses – despite it being released under an open licence.This means that it can be freely downloaded and adapted by users.“We will release a multimodal Llama model over the coming months, but not in the EU due to the unpredictable nature of the European regulatory environment,” Meta spokesperson Kate McLaughlin told The Verge.In May, Meta updated its policy, saying that it will use publicly available user data, including photos, videos and posts, to train its AI model. However, last month, the company was ordered to stop training its AI models with such content as it may violate privacy rules.Meta has also paused plans to release its AI assistant in the EU as well as generative AI tools in Brazil due to concerns raised about data protection compliance.Meta’s decision follows a similar move by Apple, which said that it plans to exclude the EU from the rollout of AI features under Apple Intelligence due to concerns surrounding the Digital Markets Act .The features that are reportedly getting delayed are Apple Intelligence (think super-smart Siri) and iPhone Mirroring (showing your phone screen on your Mac) among others. These are set to launch with the next big iPhone update coming later in 2024.Apple pointed fingers at the Digital Markets Act (DMA), saying that the company is “concerned that the interoperability requirements of the DMA could force us to compromise the integrity of our products.”","Facebook parent company Meta has said that it will not launch its upcoming multimodal AI model Llama in the European Union ( EU ) The company said that the region’s regulations have an “unpredictable nature”, making it the second big technology company after Apple to make such a decision.

State-owned telecom operator BSNL has reportedly witnessed a surge in new subscribers following recent tariff hikes by private players Reliance Jio , Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea. According to a report in Economic Times, BSNL has added over 2.75 million customers since the price increases took effect, including a significant number of port-in users.As per information shared by BSNL with ET, since July 3-4, when the hike by three private players—Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea—came into effect, some 250,000 customers have ported to the state-run firm from other operators by utilising mobile number portability (MNP).BSNL's relatively cheaper plans, particularly in the lower price brackets, have reportedly attracted cost-conscious consumers.However, while the numbers look good for the company, experts caution that the long-term sustainability of this growth depends on the company's ability to improve network quality and expand its 4G coverage. Analysts predict that the surge in BSNL customers may be temporary as consumers adjust to the new pricing structure.BSNL's employees union has expressed concerns about the impact of the tariff hikes on consumers, highlighting the company's role as a price regulator in the past.In a related news, the government is reportedly considering the option of handing over operations of Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd (MTNL) to BSNL through an agreement, instead of pursuing a merger route. A final call on this is likely to be taken in a month's time.Sources told ET that the option of handing over debt-laden MTNL's operations to BSNL through an agreement is being looked into. The source said that given MTNL's high debt, a merger with BSNL was not a favourable option.Once the decision is taken, the proposal would be placed before the Committee of Secretaries, and thereafter taken to the Cabinet.Amid mounting financial woes, MTNL this week informed in a statutory filing that it is unable to make interest payments to certain bondholders ""due to insufficient funds"". MTNL's losses mounted to Rs 3,267.5 crore in FY24 from Rs 2,915.1 crore in FY23. Revenue from operations in last fiscal year was Rs 798.56 crore, down 14.6 per cent from a year ago.","State-owned telecom operator BSNL has reportedly witnessed a surge in new subscribers following recent tariff hikes by private players Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea.

PhonePe CEO Sameer Nigam has voiced his dissatisfaction with Karnataka's private sector quota bill . The controversial bill, which is now put on hold after backlash, proposes 50 percent of management jobs and 70 percent of non-management roles to be reserved for locals in the private sector.PhonePE CEO took to microblogging platform X (formerly Known as Twitter) to express his concern over the bill.Calling it a ‘shame’, Nigam said that he ‘builds companies’ and has created 25000+ jobs across India. Citing his father’s example who worked in the Indian Navy and worked all over the country during his posting, he asks “His kids don't deserve jobs in Karnataka?”.Commenting on Nigam’s X post, a user wrote “Who says you don’t deserve Jobs in Karnataka? All you have to do is LEARN THE LANGUAGE! Why so much hue and cry?”. Replying to him, the PhonePe CEO said “Karnataka <> only Kannada speaking people. Get it? I can work wherever I want in India. I can learn any language that I want to. The constitution of India gives me these rights. IT'S MY CHOICE. Get the hue and cry.”“A fairly strong comment from a reticdnt builder.

IT giant HCLTech , however, has no plans to do the same. In an interview with Money Control, chief executive officer (CEO) C Vijayakumar said that the company has “no such plans to link variable compensation with bringing people to office”.“Return to office continues to increase, and it varies from business line to business line.Some business lines, we're able to comfortably work remotely. And for some business lines, we think getting people back to work is the right strategy. We don't have any such plans to link variable compensation with bringing people to office,” Vijayakumar said.The report also quotes HCLTech chief people officer Ramachandran Sundararajan who said during the company’s Q1 earnings conference on July 12 that variable pay is not a big cost for the IT company. “The quarterly variable pay is only applicable for the junior level employees and not the mid and senior levels. And there is no significant shift in that decision, it’s the same quarter on quarter,” Sundararajan then said.HCL Tech CEO dismisses fears of technology insourcing eating into the share of Indian software exporterStating that such insourcing is limited to mostly large captive players and few conglomerates, Vijayakumar told Economic Times, “I don't think it's across the board. There are continued opportunities to build India centres for global clients. It's only some very large institutions, especially very large banks, who can build a big scale in India, are those who are likely to insource a little bit more.”He stated that the company’s dip in growth in engineering, research and development (ER&D) and in financial services will bounce back from the third quarter. “..although the next three quarters of the fiscal year ending March 2025 are likely to remain subdued as in FY24,” he added.Vijayakumar also highlighted that investments in generative artificial intelligence (AI) will bring the next discretionary spend growth. The Noida-based IT major is working on around 200 proofs of concept in GenAI which are already contributing to its revenue.“It will continue to scale. I think the next discretionary spend growth will come from GenAI-related investments, I would think.

How Amazon’s ‘dirty diapers mistake’ killed this multi-million dollar family business,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-amazons-dirty-diapers-mistake-killed-this-multi-million-dollar-family-business/articleshow/111812571.cms,"‘Damaging review’ stayed for years

What Amazon said

A small family business selling washable swim diapers on Amazon was ruined after the e-commerce giant resold a used, faeces-stained diaper to a customer, according to a report from Bloomberg.Paul and Rachelle Baron , owners of Beau & Belle Littles, say their once-thriving company has been devastated by a single one-star review left in 2020. The customer received a diaper ""covered in poop stains"" that Amazon had apparently failed to inspect before reselling as new.The review, which included photos of the soiled diaper, quickly gained traction as other shoppers marked it ""helpful."" This boosted its visibility in Amazon's algorithm, overshadowing hundreds of positive reviews.""The last four years have been an emotional train wreck,"" Paul Baron told Bloomberg. The couple says they are now $600,000 in debt, barely making enough to pay down loans and order inventory.Amazon's policy requires inspection of all returned items before resale. However, consultants told Bloomberg that selling used products as new is a growing problem on the platform. The sheer volume of returns makes thorough inspection difficult, according to a former Amazon employee.Despite repeated pleas from the Barons, Amazon reportedly refused to remove the damaging review for years. The company finally took it down hours after Bloomberg published its report on Monday.In a statement to Bloomberg, Amazon spokesperson Chris Oster said they have since improved their returns process and updated policies to prevent resale of certain returned products. He called such incidents ""extremely rare.""While Amazon’s marketplace provides small businesses access to millions of customers, the case highlights that sellers have little recourse when things go wrong. Some critics say Amazon's algorithms and review system can amplify isolated incidents, potentially ruining businesses over a single mistake.For the Barons, who once appeared on national television as an Amazon success story, the damage has already been done. They are now seeking additional work to make ends meet.""Amazon talks a big game about helping small businesses,"" Paul Baron said. ""But they really don't.""","Beau & Belle Littles, a small business selling washable swim diapers, was ruined by a single one-star review left in 2020.

Government suspends these two telemarketing companies over sending 5.5 million fraud SMSes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/government-suspends-these-two-telemarketing-companies-over-fraud-smses/articleshow/111823013.cms,"The duo sent over 5mn fraud SMSes since Jan, 2024, DoT claims

What the companies has to say about it?

Amid rising SMS frauds in the country, the department of telecommunications ( DoT ) has suspended operations of two telemarketing companies, namely V-con Intelligent Security and OneXtel Media, reports Economic Times. In its direction dated July 15, the telecom department said that the two misused their platform to send malicious and phishing SMSes, the report states.“In the interest of safeguarding the citizens from cybercrime/financial frauds, all the TSPs (telecom service providers) are directed to: immediately suspend these two RTMs (registered telemarketers )…(and) lodge police complaint against them for misusing DLT platform for sending malicious and phishing SMSes,” read the DoT direction.V-con - a part of the Videocon Group, and OneXtel Media were found responsible for sending 55.5 million fraudulent SMSes to smartphone users since January 2024. DoT’s action comes after receiving several complaints filed by telecom users on the Chakshu portal about malicious SMSes.Quoting officials involved in the investigations, the ET report states that the DoT ordered blacklisting of 131 principal entities (PEs), 5,000 SMS content templates, and 700 SMS headers. However, the fraud senders came up with new headers to cheat the blockchain-based SMS filtering system.The ET report says that it was also found that one among these two entities – V-con and OneXtel – had received money from bank accounts that were involved in multiple complaints of organised transnational crimes, including illegal stock investment frauds.As per the report, OneXtel has strongly opposed the government’s suspension on grounds that the company was not given any opportunity to present its case. Abrar Chunawala, chief executive of OneXtel Media said “We are in cognizance of DoT’s order but also surprised on how the government has casted the burden on a reputed telemarketer like us operating since nine years. It must be noted that we were never intimated about the department’s action, no show-cause notice was served.”“The 55.5 million ballpark figure given in the order, presumably is for 6 months and belongs to two entities. Let’s assume 17 million of these were passed through Onextel. This represents only 0.06% of our total traffic. Is it then fair to suddenly put a company out of business for such a small percentage? As per regulation, it is the responsibility of telecom companies to operate the DLT system. Are they not at fault along with their DLT tech partners?” Chunawala added.",V-con Intelligent Security and OneXtel Media were found responsible for sending 55.5 million fraudulent SMSes to smartphone users since January 2024.

Ashneer Grover , founder of BharatPe and ex-Shark Tank judge recently sat for a podcast interview with YouTuber Ishan Sharma. During the interview, Grover shared his thoughts about the hiring process stating that he does not believe in lengthy hiring process and notice periods. He said that he believes in ‘ hire fast, fire fast ’ rule.When asked about how he hires and manages people, Grover said that he has personally not experienced 100% success in hiring the right candidate.“What I have basically understood about hiring, and a lot of people don’t agree with this thought, it’s hire fast, fire fast,” he said in the podcast.Explaining further, he added “What’s happening currently is that you are investing a lot of time in hiring a person, you go through multiple rounds. The candidate is also, naturally, at his best behaviour. When a candidate comes to sell himself or pitch for himself, then the salesman in him is at its peak. At the end of the day, you will get to know whether he will work or not only after you give him his tasks,”.“Sometimes people are able to sell themselves very well. My realisation is this – we spend 3 months identifying the ideal candidate, then the candidate serves his 2 months of notice period, so we wait for those 2 months. We, at this point, have already invested around 6 months into this role. Once the candidate joins, we want to give him the same amount of time to prove himself. So from 6 months, now it is 1 year.”“After a year, you realise he is not a good fit. I think the best thing to do is to do local optimisation, you decide you need a candidate in a week-15 days, you get him in fast. Judge him on his work faster. And it is very simple to understand who works and who does not. So, hire fast and fire fast,” Grover said in the podcast.","BharatPe founder and ex-Shark Tank judge Ashneer Grover sat for a podcast interview with YouTuber Ishan Sharma.
