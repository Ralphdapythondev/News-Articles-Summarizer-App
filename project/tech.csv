Microsoft job cuts: Company lays off employees in this unit,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-job-cuts-company-lays-off-employees-in-this-unit/articleshow/110686440.cms,"Previous job cuts at Microsoft

Microsoft is cutting jobs in its mixed reality unit but has said that the HoloLens 2 headset is here to stay. Despite the job cuts , Microsoft will continue selling and presumably supporting the HoloLens 2 augmented reality device.“Earlier today we announced a restructuring of the Microsoft’s Mixed Reality organisation. We remain fully committed to the Department of Defense’s IVAS program and will continue to deliver cutting edge technology to support our soldiers. In addition, we will continue to invest in W365 to reach the broader Mixed Reality hardware ecosystem. We will continue to sell HoloLens 2 while supporting existing HoloLens 2 customers and partners,” a spokesperson said in an email.While the company hasn’t mentioned the number of employees that have been let go, CNBC cited a person familiar with the matter that the company is reducing the workforce by over 1,000 people.Microsoft also said that it remains committed to its Mesh feature , which enables users in headsets to join 3D video calls within Teams alongside colleagues. During November's Microsoft Ignite conference in Seattle, company CEO Satya Nadella said that the company's focus is on ""reimagining how employees connect and collaborate,"" regardless of their device (PC, HoloLens, Meta headset, etc.).These layoffs come a year after a broader restructuring that saw 10,000 employees let go, including some in mixed reality. Despite the workforce reduction, the company assures users that the HoloLens 2 augmented reality headset remains available for purchase and presumably continues to be supported.“Organisational and workforce adjustments are a necessary and regular part of managing our business. We will continue to prioritise and invest in strategic growth areas for our future and in support of our customers and partners,” a separate statement said, addressing broader job cuts at the company.","Microsoft is cutting jobs in its mixed reality unit but has said that the HoloLens 2 headset is here to stay.

How Zara's 'Chinese problem' in Europe may get a foothold in London,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-zaras-chinese-problem-in-europe-may-get-a-foothold-in-london/articleshow/110676026.cms,"



What makes Shein, Zara's 'Chinese problem'





France too wooing Shein

Shein , the Chinese-origin fast-fashion behemoth, is poised to announce its intention for a London stock market debut, potentially this week, with an estimated valuation of £50 billion ($64 billion). Insiders suggest that the company might disclose its initial public offering (IPO) plans for the British capital soon.China’s Shein is an online marketplace with no physical stores. Shein’s rapid expansion in the online marketplace is said to have put pressure on major retailers like Zara owner Inditex and Sweden’s H&M in Europe and parts of Asia. Shein is also the same Chinese e-tailer that has been a major worry for Amazon and other clothing and accessories retail giants in the US.Unlisted Shein is the world's biggest fast-fashion retailer with an estimated 18% market share, according to Coresight Research. This may be changing now with the London IPO. The proposed UK filing is said to be a confidential IPO, granting Shein greater discretion and the option to withhold strategic details before going public. However, finalizing the London IPO could span several months.Shein’s consideration of London follows resistance to a New York listing, amidst heightened US-China trade tensions. Reports from the Financial Times indicate that Shein’s plans could be submitted to UK authorities shortly.These revelations are reported to follow discussions between UK finance minister Jeremy Hunt and Shein’s executive chairman Donald Tang about a potential London IPO, as reported by Sky News in February.With the Conservatives lagging behind Labour in the polls and a general election looming on July 4, the confirmation of Shein’s listing could serve as a campaign boost for the ruling party. Analyst Susannah Streeter from Hargreaves Lansdown suggests this could underscore the success of the government’s efforts to attract firms to London’s financial market.Labour has also engaged with Tang, signaling its intent to fortify its business appeal, while French officials have reportedly lobbied for Shein to choose Paris over London.Shein, which originated in China and is headquartered in Singapore, has rapidly dominated the global fast fashion scene, leveraging social media to reach young consumers.However, the company has faced criticism for its production practices, lack of supply chain transparency, and environmental impact. A study by Stand Earth labeled Shein as the most environmentally detrimental fast-fashion brand globally.The European Union has recently included Shein in its roster of digital entities subject to more stringent regulations.","Shein, the Chinese-origin fast-fashion behemoth, is poised to announce its intention for a London stock market debut, potentially this week.

How Storm-0539 escapes detection

What internet and smartphone users can do to protect themselves

Cybercriminals are constantly innovating, and gift cards have become a new battleground. Microsoft Threat Intelligence report warns that gift cards are an attractive target due to the lack of personal information attached to them, making them ideal for fraud and social engineering schemes.The report highlights a specific threat actor group, Storm-0539 (also known as Atlas Lion), which has been particularly active around major US holidays. In the lead-up to Memorial Day 2024, Microsoft observed a 30% increase in activity from this group, suggesting a potential surge in attacks during peak shopping seasons.This cybercrime group has been active since late 2021 and demonstrates a concerning evolution. Previously focused on compromising point-of-sale systems to steal credit card data, they've shifted to targeting cloud and identity services. The aim is to infiltrate the payment systems of large retailers, luxury brands, and fast food restaurants to steal or manipulate gift cards.What makes Storm-0539 particularly dangerous is their sophisticated approach. They exploit their deep understanding of cloud environments to scout out organizations' gift card systems and employee access points. Their methods mirror those of nation-state attackers, granting them persistent access to create and steal gift cards for illicit purposes.To avoid detection, Storm-0539 utilizes deceptive tactics. They pose as legitimate organizations, acquiring cloud resources under the guise of non-profits. They even create fake websites with misleading domain names to lure unsuspecting victims.For organizations issuing gift cards, vigilance is key. Treat gift card portals as high-value targets and implement continuous monitoring for suspicious activity. Multi-factor authentication and strong access controls are crucial to hinder these attackers. Additionally, investing in cloud security best practices and educating staff on social engineering tactics are essential lines of defense.","Gift cards are an attractive target due to the lack of personal information attached to them, making them ideal for fraud and social engineering schemes.

How setting your AC to the default temperature is important



Humidity can force you to decrease temperature



Proper airflow will cool your room faster



Smart ACs can add to convenience



Finding the perfect balance between staying cool and maintaining energy efficiency becomes a priority as the scorching summer heat takes hold. There is one question that often arises among users: What is the ideal temperature for the air conditioning (AC) while sleeping?Well, the answer isn’t straightforward. Let us explain…A government advisory has shared in consultation with the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) fixed the default temperature according to new energy performance standards for Room Air Conditioner (RACs)., the advisory says.Setting the right temperature while sleeping can also help you save your electricity bills . Air conditioners consume more energy to maintain lower temperatures. The closer the indoor temperature is to the outdoor temperature, the less the AC has to work, resulting in lower energy consumption.By setting your AC to an optimal temperature while you sleep, you can significantly reduce energy usage and save on electricity bills . Also, setting the temperature to 18 won’t make your AC cool faster but will consume more electricity. So it’s better to keep the AC in its default temperature.High humidity can make a room feel warmer than it is. Using a dehumidifier alongside your AC can help maintain a comfortable environment.Proper air circulation can enhance the cooling effect of your AC. Consider using a ceiling fan or a portable fan to help distribute cool air more evenly.Smart ACs can be controlled through your smartphone and will allow you to set different temperatures for different times of the day. You can program it to cool your bedroom just before bedtime and raise the temperature slightly as you wake up.","A government advisory has shared in consultation with the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) fixed the default temperature according to new energy performance standards.

As India undergoes its largest democratic exercise, the Lok Sabha Elections 2024 , WhatsApp’s Tipline has emerged as a crucial tool for combating the spread of deepfakes and misinformation. Created by the Misinformation Combat Alliance’s (MCA) Deepfakes Analysis Unit (DAU), the Tipline aims to raise public awareness and provide assistance in identifying AI-manipulated content.: Launched in March 2024, WhatsApp’s Tipline has quickly become a trusted resource for users seeking to verify the authenticity of images and videos. Since its inception, the Tipline has received hundreds of messages from users asking for help in distinguishing real from fake content.: The Tipline is accessible in multiple languages, including Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, and English, making it widely usable across India’s diverse linguistic landscape.Users can flag suspected deepfake content by sending audio notes or videos to the Tipline. The process is listed below:Most of the manipulated content received involves doctored videos where the original audio is altered using AI to make a person appear to say something they did not. These videos often feature prominent figures such as actors, businessmen, politicians, and TV anchors. Additionally, AI-created memes of politicians using face-blending techniques or other less sophisticated methods have been commonly reported.WhatsApp’s Tipline uses advanced generative AI to analyze and detect deepfakes. This involves reconstructing the mouth movements of subjects to sync with altered audio, making the deepfakes appear more convincing.Pamposh Raina, Head of the DAU, emphasized the collaborative nature of the DAU’s approach. By partnering with detection and forensic experts, the DAU supports its fact-checking partners who play a critical role in this project. Raina stated, “The strength of the DAU lies in the collaborative model which it is building by partnering with detection and forensic experts. Our goal is to drive public awareness on the issue of algorithm-based fabrication, and I am confident that this symbiotic model can be replicated globally to combat misinformation spread through audio and video content produced using generative AI.”The successful implementation of WhatsApp’s Tipline during the Lok Sabha elections 2024 highlights the potential of such tools in combating misinformation. As deepfake technology continues to evolve, the need for robust detection and public awareness mechanisms becomes increasingly critical. WhatsApp’s initiative sets a precedent for similar efforts worldwide, showcasing how technology and collaboration can effectively address the challenges posed by AI-generated misinformation.",WhatsApp’s Tipline uses advanced generative AI to analyze and detect deepfakes.

Airtel’s $100-billion market cap is testimony to today’s India

A meeting with PM Narendra Modi in September 2018 proved a turning point for Bharti Airtel chairman Sunil Bharti Mittal. In an exclusive interaction with Economic Times, Mittal spoke about a range of things including his meeting with PM Modi, Airtel's journey to $100 billion market capitalisation and more.Mittal recalled Reliance Jio's entry in 2016 and how it turned the industry upside down. ""September 2016 was the Jio launch and 2018 was the time when I think the industry was in the most distress… Ebitda had crashed due to the free services. We had to keep going down (in terms of tariffs). Then the first losses started at that time after many years and debt was pretty high. So the company was shaky. And in March 2018, I still recall that you could sense a concern among the rank and file of the company. You could see it on the faces of professionals working at Airtel. Company after company was folding up — Tatas selling to us, three companies going into NCLT. And that was the time that the regulatory hits started to bother me. Regulations, which were coming one after the other, were disturbing,"" said.""And then in 2018, I sought a meeting with the PM,"" he went on to add. ""I was still the chairman of GSMA… just coming out from the chairmanship of the International Chamber of Commerce, when I used to brief him (PM) occasionally on WTO, G20 and other issues. So, I took his permission to talk about the Indian telecom industry. I told him that things were very bad and the situation was getting very alarming. I said I will fight in the marketplace, but I can’t fight the government… we spoke in Hindi. He told me that this government will not tilt towards either side. Whatever is good for the country will be done. You fight in the marketplace... I don’t have a view on that. But you can be sure that the government will not take sides,"" Mittal said.He went on to add how the PM's words kind of assured him. That was enough for me. I got up and I thanked him, and said, “I will fight in the market”. This was the turning point.""Talking about Airtel's $100 billion market cap milestone, Mittal said, ""This $100-billion market cap is a testimony to what India is today, not just my company. Money is pouring into this country, a lot of capital is coming in, investments are coming in, the stock market is rising. These massive valuations are a function of a stable, solid, functional economy under a very solid leader.""","Mittal recalled Reliance Jio's entry in 2016 and how it turned the industry upside down.
