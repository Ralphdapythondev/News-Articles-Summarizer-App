What the lawsuit says



What Facebook-parent Meta, TikTok said

Brazil’s Collective Defense Institute has filed lawsuits against social media giants TikTok , Facebook-parent Meta and Kwai, reports Reuters. The report says that the organisation filed two lawsuits alleging their failure to create mechanisms to prevent excess use of these social media platforms by minors. The lawsuits demand 3 billion reais ($525.27 million) from the Brazilian units of TikTok, Kwai and Meta Platforms.The lawsuits are reportedly based on studies on the possible damage caused by unsupervised use of social media, especially by children and teenagers. They urge the courts in Minas Gerais to direct companies to establish clear data protection measures and to issue warnings regarding the potential risks to the mental health of children and teenagers stemming from platform addiction.Lawyer Lillian Salgado, one of the plaintiffs said “It is urgent that measures be adopted in order to change the way the algorithm works, the processing of data from users under 18, and the way in which teenagers aged 13 and over are supervised and their accounts created, in order to ensure a safer, healthier experience ... as is already the case in developed countries”.In a statement, Meta Platforms said that it wants “young people to have safe and age-appropriate experiences on our apps, and we have been working on these issues for over a decade, developing more than 50 tools, resources, and features to support teens and their guardians.”The company stated that it had recently announced a new “Teen Account” on Instagram , which will arrive in Brazil soon. It will automatically limit the accounts teenagers can see and who may contact them.TikTok said it had not received any notice about the case.","Brazil’s Collective Defense Institute has filed lawsuits against social media giants TikTok, Facebook-parent Meta and Kwai.

Google Search prioritises Reddit in its results

Reddit CEO Steve Huffman is looking to challenge Google Search and for this, he is relying on the platform’s vast network of specialised communities and user-generated content . Huffman sees this data emerging as a significant challenger to Google's long-held dominance in the search market .According to a report by Business Insider, Huffman believes that Reddit's unique value proposition – authentic information, diverse perspectives, and active discussions – is attracting users who are increasingly seeking answers and insights beyond traditional search engines.Reddit is a vast network of over a million specialised communities (subreddits) that has become a resource for young users for finding authentic information in the digital age, the report notes, adding that the collaborative approach to knowledge sharing is attracting a growing number of users.Reddit CEO says platform’s reliability can challenge Google SearchHuffman highlighted this growing trend where users intentionally use Google Search as a stepping stone to reach Reddit for information.“People are going to Google with the intention of ending up on Reddit,” Huffman said at a conference this week hosted by The Wall Street Journal.""And I think what's happening is people know that Reddit has answers, advice, perspectives on just about whatever you're looking for,” he added.Interestingly, Google itself has contributed to Reddit's rise in search rankings by prioritising user-generated content in its algorithm, the report claims. This move, however, is attributed to Google's focus on providing diverse perspectives and experiences in search results, rather than a specific partnership with Reddit.A Google spokesperson said that the company's research shows that “people often want to learn from others' experiences with a topic, so we've continued to make it easier to find helpful perspectives on Search when it's relevant to a query.”Google and Reddit also announced a deal in February that allows Google to train its AI models using Reddit comments.",Reddit CEO says platform’s reliability can challenge Google Search.

Here's the complete blog post written by Rima Alaily, CVP, Deputy General Counsel, Microsoft

Since moving into my current role at Microsoft almost seven years ago, I’ve worked hard to be genuine, responsive, and transparent. I’ve taken pains to tell the truth, even when that might make things more complicated for Microsoft. I think, and hope people I’ve engaged with – including reporters, and regulators – would say the same. It’s not comfortable or natural for me to pen something critical of someone else, but in this case, I think it’s important because it concerns me when someone attacks us and, I believe, does so dishonestly.

This week an astroturf group organized by Google is launching. It is designed to discredit Microsoft with competition authorities, and policymakers and mislead the public. Google has gone through great lengths to obfuscate its involvement, funding, and control, most notably by recruiting a handful of European cloud providers, to serve as the public face of the new organization. When the group launches, Google, we understand, will likely present itself as a backseat member rather than its leader. It remains to be seen what Google offered smaller companies to join, either in terms of cash or discounts.

This latest effort comes on the heels of their recent failure to weaponize another organization – CISPE – against Microsoft. In July, when CISPE was on the verge of resolving its complaint against Microsoft, Google offered CISPE’s members a combination of cash and credits amounting to an eye-popping $500 million to reject the settlement and continue pursuing litigation. Wisely, they declined. And, instead, the CISPE members endorsed the resolution we had developed together.

Google’s tactics, unfortunately, go beyond creating astroturf lobbying organizations. They’re also speaking out in their own name in disingenuous ways and putting forward paid commentators to discredit us. Why? I suspect much has to do with the fact that Google is facing a reckoning. Never in the past two decades have Google’s search, digital advertising, and mobile app store monopolies faced such a concerted and determined threat as they do today. By our count, there are at least 24 antitrust investigations against Google in the leading digital markets around the world. At a time when Google should be focused on addressing legitimate questions about its business, it is instead turning its vast resources towards tearing down others. It is disappointing that, with the foundation of their business facing jeopardy, they have sought to bolster their cloud computing service – Google Cloud Platform – by attacking ours.

It seems Google has two ultimate goals in its astroturfing efforts: distract from the intense regulatory scrutiny Google is facing around the world by discrediting Microsoft and tilt the regulatory landscape in favor of its cloud services rather than competing on the merits.

Google’s new European astroturf lobbying organization

We recently learned that, following its rejection by CISPE, Google pivoted to stand up its own astroturf lobbying organization. It hired a lobbying and communications agency in Europe to create and operate the organization. And it recruited several small European cloud providers to join. One of the companies approached, who ultimately declined, told us that the organization will be directed and largely funded by Google for the purpose of attacking Microsoft’s cloud computing business in the European Union and the United Kingdom. Of course, the innocuous recruitment document omits any mention of Google’s involvement and the actual purpose of the organization. We have been informed that the organization will be led by

Nicky Stewart

, who personally penned complaints against Microsoft and Amazon Web Services (AWS) in the UK Competition and Market Authority’s ongoing investigation into the cloud computing market.

In September, Google took an unusual step and publicly announced that it had filed a formal complaint concerning Microsoft’s software licensing practices for the cloud with the European Commission. Most such complaints are submitted confidentially, but Google took the opportunity to broadcast its concerns. Although it suggests that Google is acting to protect the interests of European customers, its complaint reads differently. Fundamentally, Google’s argument is that it should not have to pay Microsoft when it builds and offers cloud services using our intellectual property – namely

Windows Server

– if customers have otherwise purchased the same software for a very different use, i.e., on their own server. We disagree. When a streaming service, like Netflix or Disney, includes a movie in their service, they pay for that right. They don’t get a credit or discount if a subscriber happens to own a DVD of the same movie. Software and the cloud are no different.

Google is also continuing, directly and through proxies, to lobby competition authorities around the world to intervene and impose restrictions on its hyperscale cloud competitors, but not itself. Google argues that it should be treated as a non-hyperscale or small cloud provider; in effect, it asserts that it is not in the same category as AWS and Microsoft. This strains credibility. Google may have been late in meeting the needs of enterprise customers, but it is fully capable of competing head-to-head with AWS and Microsoft. It does not need competition authorities to put a thumb on the scale in its favor. Google is a leader in datacenter capacity, with an operational capacity of 3,500 MW in 2023, more than any other provider. As one of the world’s most valuable companies, last quarter it achieved 29% growth rate in its cloud business and invested $13 billion to grow its infrastructure. We hope Google does not prevail in misleading competition authorities, because the companies with most to lose from this would be every other non-hyperscale cloud provider across the globe and the customers we all serve.

Google’s pattern of shadowy campaigns

In Europe and in the U.S., Google has taken a page out of its decades-long playbook for litigating against antitrust enforcers. It is funding – directly and indirectly – various industry commentators and academics to attack Microsoft and author “studies” that can be cited to discredit us. Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter at the United States Department of Justice recently condemned tactics like these as undermining true expertise and antitrust enforcement. Indeed, these commentators often misrepresent their credentials or mask their affiliation with to appear as neutral experts.

Just recently one of these commentators published an op-ed calling for regulatory intervention and echoing Google’s arguments, citing past ties to Microsoft and Google, perhaps to seem impartial. We took note, since we had not worked with the author for many years and had no current relationship. After we raised the issue with the publication, it updated the article to properly disclose the author’s affiliation with a private consulting firm which has counted Google as a client.

Europe is not the only jurisdiction where Google is engaged in these tactics, nor is software licensing for the cloud the only topic Google is using to attack us behind the scenes.

We understand Google is a main funder of the U.S.-based Coalition for Fair Software Licensing, which has levied attacks on our cloud computing business in the United States, the United Kingdom, and the EU. The organization is run by a well-known lobbyist for Google in Washington DC, but Google’s affiliation isn’t disclosed publicly by the organization.

Google has also attacked us on topics ranging from cybersecurity to our business in China, pitching stories to reporters, suggesting questions to congressional offices ahead of hearings, and distributing documents in major capitals around the world. Earlier this year, Google distributed a “fact sheet” in Washington DC attempting to drum up concerns about our approach to the Chinese market. The document is misleading and filled with inaccuracies, which we attempted to raise directly with Google leadership with no resolution.

Google’s work on this range of topics underscores the fact that it is less concerned about Microsoft’s conduct in the cloud market than it is with discrediting a competitor wherever it can get a foothold.

Microsoft’s approach

We are always listening when it comes to our products, licensing, and business strategy, which is why we try to respond to genuine feedback from customers, partners, and regulators and make swift changes.

This was the basis of our offer to CISPE members. Having previously agreed to collaborate on a technology solution to address market challenges they faced. It was logical at the time – and continues to be – that we did not make the same changes for hyperscale providers like Google and Amazon who are very differently situated in the marketplace.

This was also the basis of the changes we proactively made to our popular business and enterprise productivity suites last year: creating versions without Teams – at a lower price – to expand choice given the concerns raised by the European Commission.

We’ve made these changes, and others, not because we believed we were doing something improper but because we understand that the role and responsibility that we have as an important global technology company and the heightened expectations that governments, regulators, policymakers, customers and partners have of us.

We will continue to listen and evolve when we hear credible, legitimate, and addressable concerns, but as Google continues to demonstrate with its actions, the arguments it wants you to believe are none of these.

Microsoft has leveled serious accusations against Google, alleging that the search giant is orchestrating a ""shadow campaign"" to undermine Microsoft's cloud business, Azure. In a scathing blog post, Microsoft's deputy general counsel, Rima Alaily , revealed that Google is on the verge of launching a new lobbying group designed to discredit Azure.According to Microsoft, Google has hired a European lobbying firm to establish this new organization, which is set to be unveiled this week. The software giant claims to have learned of this campaign through an unnamed European cloud provider who declined to participate and subsequently alerted Microsoft.This latest development comes shortly after Google filed an antitrust complaint against Microsoft with EU regulators in September. In its complaint, Google accused Microsoft of unfair licensing practices for Azure. This move followed Microsoft's settlement with CISPE, a group of European cloud infrastructure providers who had previously raised similar concerns about Microsoft's licensing terms.Microsoft alleges that Google actively attempted to thwart its settlement with CISPE in July. The company suggests that this recent escalation of hostilities between the two tech giants may signal a return to the intense rivalry that characterized their past interactions, reminiscent of the ""Scroogled"" campaign and disputes over Google services on Windows Phone.","Rima Alaily, CVP, Deputy General Counsel, Microsoft, wrote a blog post critical of Google.

Reliance enters in partnership with Nvidia

The 2024 Nvidia AI Summit in Mumbai saw Bollywood superstar Akshay Kumar rubbing shoulders with Jensen Huang , CEO of AI giant Nvidia. While the summit focused on strengthening India's AI capabilities, their encounter ended with a surprising discussion – martial arts.Kumar, a known martial arts enthusiast, shared a photo on social media X, formerly known as Twitter, where he and Huang pose playfully in a fighting stance. The caption reads: ""Imagine meeting the world’s biggest authority on Artificial Intelligence and ending up chatting about martial arts!! What an amazing man you are Mr. #JensenHuang. Now I know why @nvidia is the absolute giant that it is. 😊👍🏻""Nvidia's leather-jacket-clad CEO Huang got a rock star welcome at the company's AI summit in India. As a Bloomberg report said, ""The reception Huang received in India's commercial capital Mumbai was reminiscent of the ""Jensanity"" seen in other parts of the world, especially Taiwan, as his popularity climbs with Nvidia's soaring earnings and multi-trillion dollar market valuation.""Huang praised India's rapid digitalisation and its potential in the AI sector. ""Very few countries have this amazing natural resource called IT and computer science expertise,"" he said.The event, where the U.S. company unveiled plans to supply Reliance Industries and other Indian firms with its AI chips, had to be reportedly delayed for more than half an hour due to the crowd that one Nvidia employee said was ""easily a few thousand"".Nvidia CEO Huang and Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani announced a strategic partnership to build state-of-the-art AI infrastructure in India at the summit. The collaboration aims to accelerate India's transformation into a global AI powerhouse by leveraging the nation's vast talent pool and burgeoning digital infrastructure. ""We are among the only countries where the average age of 1.4 billion people is below 35,"" he noted. Ambani emphasised that India's aspirations, combined with the visionary leadership of the Indian Prime Minister, have set the stage for a digital revolution. ""We are at the doorstep of the new intelligence age,"" he said.","Jensen Huang, CEO of AI giant Nvidia, met Bollywood superstar Akshay Kumar at the 2024 Nvidia AI Summit in Mumbai.

The company has been considering a sale, and Reuters recently reported that Altair was exploring such a move.While discussions are ongoing, there's no guarantee that Siemens will ultimately decide to proceed with the acquisition. Other potential bidders could also emerge for Altair. Representatives from both companies have declined to comment on the matter.Founded by James Scapa, Altair offers a wide range of engineering software solutions to companies across various industries, including aerospace, automotive, energy, and financial services. The growing demand for such tools, driven by the increasing adoption of artificial intelligence, makes Altair a particularly attractive target for Siemens.Under the leadership of CEO Roland Busch , Siemens has been strategically shifting its focus away from heavy equipment businesses and towards higher-margin, software-driven product lines. This strategic shift aligns with the company's aim to catch up to its competitors in the automation industry, such as Rockwell Automation and Schneider Electric.The potential acquisition of Altair would further strengthen Siemens' position in the software market and enhance its capabilities in providing comprehensive engineering solutions to its customers.","Siemens AG is reportedly exploring a potential acquisition of Altair Engineering Inc. If finalized, this move would mark one of Siemens' largest acquisitions to date. Altair's stock has seen a significant surge of 27% this year, valuing the company at approximately $9.1 billion.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114558935,imgsize-72982,width-400,resizemode-4/114558935.jpg"

Netflix launches “Moments” feature on iPhones: Here’s what it does,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/netflix-launches-moments-feature-on-iphones-heres-what-it-does/articleshow/114698768.cms,"What is it and how it works

Netflix is introducing a feature called “Moments” that will allow users to quickly save and revisit their favourite scenes from movies and shows, and even share them with friends. The feature is available now on iPhones and coming soon to Android , the company has announced.“Whether you’re replaying the intense final showdown in BEEF or a spooky twist in Wednesday, Moments lets you save and share it all. And with Season 2 of Squid Game coming on Dec. 26, it’s the perfect time to revisit those nail-biting game sequences from Season 1 and get ready for what’s next,” Netflix said.Moments lets users capture those scenes – which they feel have left a mark – with a simple tap, adding them to the “My Netflix” tab for easy access.For example, if you are watching Interstellar on Netflix on your phone and want to save the scene where Cooper and Dr Brand attempt to dock their aircraft to the Endurance spaceship. All users have to do is tap Moments at the bottom of the screen, and it’ll automatically save the scene to My Netflix tab.“You can revisit your Moments anytime on your phone, and if you rewatch the episode or film, it will start playing right from the scene you bookmarked,”Nexflix says.As far as sharing is concerned, Moments on Instagram , Facebook and other social platforms can be shared from the My Netflix tab by selecting a scene and tapping to share it across all of your platforms.The launch of Moments coincides with Netflix's new global brand campaign, ""It's So Good,"" featuring iconic moments and beloved celebrities like Cardi B, Simone Biles, and Giancarlo Esposito.Netflix says that it also plans to expand the Moments feature in the future, offering even more ways for users to engage with their favourite content and share their passion with others.","Netflix is introducing a feature called “Moments’ that will allow users to quickly save and revisit their favourite scenes from movies and shows.

How NotebookLlama works

Facebook parent Meta has released an AI tool that can create a PDF-to-podcast workflow, meaning it can transform PDFs into podcasts with this easy-to-follow guide. This capability, called NotebookLlama , is similar to Google ’s NotebookLM .However, there is one big difference: NotebookLlama is “an Open Source version of NotebookLM” which means any developer can access, modify, and distribute the source code and related materials.NotebookLlama is an AI-powered tool that can transform a PDF document, like a news article or blog post, into a podcast-style script. According to the explanation on the tool’s github page, it does transform raw content by first creating a text transcript of the PDF and then adding elements like dramatic pauses and interruptions to make it sound more like a natural conversation. This enhanced script is then fed into text-to-speech models to generate the final audio output.Meta researchers say that the current quality of the generated podcast depends heavily on the capabilities of the text-to-speech models, and believe that using more advanced models may significantly improve the naturalness and expressiveness of the generated speech.“The text-to-speech model is the limitation of how natural this will sound,” NotebookLlama’s GitHub page says.Furthermore, they suggest that an even more engaging podcast could be created by using two AI agents to ""debate"" the topic and generate a more dynamic and interactive script.“...another approach of writing the podcast would be having two agents debate the topic of interest and write the podcast outline. Right now we use a single model to write the podcast outline,” it added.Google’s NotebookLM also allows users to upload PDFs, websites, YouTube videos, audio files, Google Docs, or Google Slides and it summarises them to “make interesting connections between topics, all powered by Gemini 1.5’s multimodal understanding capabilities.”","NotebookLlama is an AI-powered tool that can transform a PDF document, like a news article or blog post, into a podcast-style script.

Elon Musk declares ‘financial emergency’: What’s behind the $35 trillion ‘time bomb’ US is said to be facing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/elon-musk-declares-financial-emergency-whats-behind-the-35-trillion-time-bomb-us-is-said-to-be-facing/articleshow/114697347.cms,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk at a rally

What's the reason behind the $35 trillion ‘time bomb’

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has raised alarm over what he calls a "" financial emergency "" as U.S. government interest payments now exceed $1 trillion annually, surpassing the entire Defense Department budget.Speaking at a recent Trump campaign rally, Musk highlighted that interest payments now consume 23% of all federal tax revenue, as the national debt has ballooned to $35.7 trillion. Bank of America analysts project the debt could reach $36 trillion by year's end, with increases of approximately $1 trillion every 100 days.The debt surge largely stems from COVID-era stimulus measures that contributed to inflation , forcing the Federal Reserve to implement historic interest rate hikes. Current projections suggest continued deficit increases, with analysts forecasting additional annual increases of $500-600 billion under various policy scenarios.The mounting debt crisis has sparked a flight to alternative assets, pushing both Bitcoin and gold to near record levels. Bitcoin has approached its all-time high of $70,000, while investors increasingly view it as ""digital gold"" amid rising inflation concerns.Legendary investor Paul Tudor Jones, who previously dubbed Bitcoin the ""fastest horse to beat inflation,"" has renewed his warning about a potential ""debt bomb"" resulting from what he terms ""fiscal recklessness."" The situation has created what analysts describe as a ""nightmare scenario"" for the Federal Reserve, which must balance controlling inflation against managing massive government obligations.Tesla maintains significant exposure to cryptocurrency markets, holding approximately 10,000 Bitcoin worth $800 million on its balance sheet. The company recently transferred its Bitcoin holdings to new wallets, prompting speculation about potential sales.","Interest payments now exceed $1 trillion annually, surpassing the entire Defense Department budget.

Apple is offering developers new tools to analyse PCC security



Apple is inviting security researchers to investigate its Private Cloud Compute (PCC) system, which powers its Apple Intelligence feature. To demonstrate the security and privacy of its artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure, the tech giant is offering rewards of up to $1 million for discovering vulnerabilities in the PCC system.While Apple emphasises that many Apple Intelligence features run on-device, more demanding tasks are processed on PCC servers. These servers, built with Apple Silicon and a new operating system, are designed to uphold Apple's commitment to user privacy. To ensure transparency and independent verification, Apple is opening up the PCC to scrutiny from security researchers.In a blog post, Apple has confirmed that researchers who discover flaws that compromise the security and privacy of PCC can now earn bounties comparable to those offered for iOS vulnerabilities, with the highest payouts for vulnerabilities that expose user data outside the PCC's secure environment. Here are the bounty amounts:The new bounty categories focus on critical threats like accidental data disclosure, external compromise through user requests, and vulnerabilities related to physical or internal access. This initiative underscores Apple's commitment to the security and privacy of its AI infrastructure and encourages researchers to help identify and address potential vulnerabilities.Apart from this, Apple will also consider any security issue that has a significant impact on PCC for an Apple Security Bounty reward, even if it doesn’t match a published category. The company will “evaluate every report according to the quality of what's presented, the proof of what can be exploited, and the impact on users.”In its blog post, Apple confirmed about creating a Virtual Research Environment (VRE) for security researchers to analyse the Private Cloud Compute (PCC) system used for Apple Intelligence. This will allow for independent verification of Apple's privacy claims and in-depth investigation of PCC software, including the Secure Enclave Processor, through tools for inspecting releases, verifying logs, booting in a virtual environment, and debugging.To access the Private Cloud Compute Virtual Research Environment, developers will need a Mac with Apple silicon and at least 16GB of unified memory running the macOS Sequoia 15.1 Developer Preview. Detailed instructions on how to get started are available on Apple's developer website.","Apple is inviting security researchers to investigate its Private Cloud Compute (PCC) system, which powers its Apple Intelligence feature.

Previously, franchisees were forced to wait for manufacturer-approved repairs due to restrictions under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ( DMCA ).The exemption comes after repair advocacy group iFixit and public interest organisation Public Knowledge filed a joint request, which received support from both the Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice . Their petition followed iFixit's 2023 teardown of the machines, which revealed easily replaceable parts that were inaccessible due to software restrictions.""There's nothing vanilla about this victory,"" said Meredith Rose, Public Knowledge's senior policy counsel, noting that the exemption will spark increased third-party repair activity and help businesses better serve customers.The decision is part of the Copyright Office's triennial review of DMCA Section 1201 exemptions, which aims to prevent copyright law from impeding legitimate device usage. While the ruling doesn't extend to all commercial and industrial equipment as originally requested, it specifically addresses the McDonald's ice cream machine issue that has become so widespread that online tracking tools have been created to monitor broken units.The change is expected to reduce service delays and improve ice cream availability at McDonald's locations.","Ruling allows third-party technicians to bypass digital locks on commercial food preparation equipment.

Engineers files FIR with cyber crime police

A Bengaluru-based techie fell victim to an online gift card scam recently, losing Rs 4.5 lakh. As per a Money Control report, the fraud started when the engineer received a Diwali gift message on WhatsApp, allegedly from his boss. “I am currently engaged in a conference call meeting and I need you to run a quick assignment. We need to provide our clients in India with some gift cards, can you confirm if we can get apple app store cards from Paytm…,” read the WhatsApp message received on October 13.Willing to make a good impression, the engineer, who was also a fresh recruit, purchased the vouchers that cost him Rs 4.35 lakh. Consequently, he shared the voucher codes as instructed. He realised he’d been duped when he casually mentioned the “gift request” to his HR department, only to find out it hadn’t come from his real boss at all.The engineer, as per the report, filed an FIR at Bellandur Cyber Crime branch the next day. Police have started investigating the case, warning others to be cautious of similar scams.The victim told the publication “Apple's customer support operates only Monday to Friday from 9am to 6pm, which significantly limits victims’ ability to seek timely assistance. I couldn’t get the IDs blocked or get any respite immediately in recovering the misused funds and had to wait till morning for Apple support to open”.","Engineers files FIR with cyber crime police after losing Rs 4.5 lakh in a gift card scam.

Explained: What is digital arrest scam and how you can protect yourself,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/explained-what-is-digital-arrest-scam-and-how-you-can-protect-yourself/articleshow/114686723.cms,"What is a digital arrest scam?

How the scam works:

Intimidation: Scammers use threats of arrest or legal action to instill fear in their victims.

Impersonation: They often pose as police officers or other law enforcement officials, using official-sounding titles and jargon.

False accusations: Victims are falsely accused of various crimes, such as cybercrime or financial fraud.

Demand for payment: To avoid arrest or legal consequences, victims are pressured to pay a fine or bribe.

Data theft: Scammers may also attempt to steal personal information, such as bank account details or passwords.



How to protect yourself:

Verify information: Never share personal information or financial details with anyone over the phone or online unless you are absolutely certain of their identity and the legitimacy of their request.

Be wary of unfamiliar numbers: Avoid answering calls from unknown numbers, especially those with foreign area codes.

Cross-check information: If you receive a suspicious call or message, try to verify the information with a trusted source, such as a government website or a known law enforcement agency.

Stay calm: Scammers often rely on fear and intimidation to manipulate their victims. Stay calm and avoid making impulsive decisions.

Report the scam: If you believe you have been targeted by a digital arrest scam, report it to the local police or cybercrime authorities. You can also report it to your internet service provider or mobile carrier.

JioHotstar.com ownership dispute explained: How JioHotstar domain went from Delhi techie to Dubai siblings,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/jiohotstar-com-ownership-dispute-explained-how-jiohotstar-domain-went-from-delhi-techie-to-dubai-siblings/articleshow/114686323.cms,"Techie - ‘a dreamer’ proposes to sell domain to Reliance



Act of stealing?

Reliance Industries refused the offer

Jiohotstar.com domain goes to Dubai siblings

The domain – JioHotstar.com is at the centre of a dramatic showdown involving an app developer in Delhi, siblings based in Dubai and the company Reliance Industries itself. It all started when a Delhi-based techie posted a letter on the internet, asking Reliance executives to fund his higher studies in exchange for giving up the jiohotstar .com domain that he bought in 2023. With the company rejecting his offer, the app developer has sold the domain to two young siblings – 13-year-old Jainam Jain and 10-year-old Jivika Jain. The episode also raises the question of domain ownership: Is it theft, extortion, or a more serious form of cybercrime?Posting an open letter addressed to the executives of Reliance Industries, the app developer asked the company to fund his higher studies abroad in exchange for the domain. “In early 2023, while scrolling through social media, I came across a news piece stating that Disney+ Hotstar was losing daily active users after losing the IPL streaming license, and Disney is considering selling or merging Hotstar with an Indian competitor,” he said in the letter.He added, “I thought, ‘If they acquire Hotstar, they might rename it to JioHotstar.com.’ I checked for the domain, and it was available. I was excited, as I felt that if this happened, I could fund my goal of studying at Cambridge.”The act of purchasing a domain and using it to profit from a trademark, corporate name, or personal name of an individual is referred to as cybersquatting. In India, there is no law to deal with cases of cybersquatting. It falls under the Trade Mark Act, 1999. The first cybersquatting case in India was Yahoo Inc. vs Akash Arora. Yahoo filed a suit against Arora for registering the domain name ""YahooIndia.com"", which was similar to Yahoo's trademark. The court, then, ruled in favor of Yahoo, preventing Arora from using the domain name.In an update, dated October 24, the techie said that he was contacted by a Reliance executive, named Ambujesh Yadav, and that the company has turned down his request and it will proceed with legal action.“An Executive from Reliance reached out - Ambujesh Yadav Ji, AVP, Commercials. A request was made for £93,345, which represents the tuition fees for the EMBA program. The request has been denied. Reliance will proceed with legal action. I hope they will reconsider this kind request. I wish such a large group could help. Thank you to all who shared and sent kind words. I don't have the power to stand against Reliance. I don't feel I infringed any trademark when I bought this in 2023, since JioHotstar was not even in existence at that time. No body has trademark for JioHotstar as of now. If any legal professional could help, I would be grateful,” he wrote.In a surprising turn of events this weekend, the domain was sold to Dubai-based siblings. Visitors to the https://jiohotstar.com are now being redirected to a webpage featuring the story of two siblings from the United Arab Emirates who run an educational initiative for disadvantaged children. The website now reads “Hello! We are Jainam and Jivika – siblings from Dubai, UAE, on a mission to make a difference. Even though we’re just kids, we believe that age is only a number when it comes to spreading kindness and positivity. Our recent journey began during our summer holidays when we left our home in Dubai for 50 unforgettable days in India.”","Reliance Industries refused the offer for the domain.

He said, ‘This is the biggest thing we've had in years!’” Now that’s some fast-food fame worth celebrating!

Former US President and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump claimed that Google CEO Sundar Pichai personally called to praise a McDonald's visit he made in Pennsylvania.During a recent appearance on Joe Rogan’s podcast, Trump claimed that Google CEO, Sundar Pichai called him to convey accolades on his visit to McDonald’s. ""I actually got a call from Sundar...the head of Google and he said, sir, I just want to tell you what you did with McDonald's was one of the single biggest events we've ever had at Google,” said Trump.While visiting a McDonald's in Pennsylvania, Trump claimed he worked briefly as a fry cook, asserting that he spent “15 minutes more” than Vice President Kamala Harris , who has previously mentioned working at the chain in her youth.Trump's comment comes after his earlier accusations that Google manipulated search results to reduce his online presence during campaign rallies. He mentioned that he had previously reached out to Pichai to address the matter.Trump has also claimed to have received similar calls from Apple CEO Tim Cook and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Like Pichai, they have neither confirmed nor denied these calls, possibly to avoid offending the former President. Claiming interactions with notable figures, including foreign leaders, has been a common tactic for Trump. Critics often view these claims as exaggerated, fictional, or self-aggrandizing, given their lack of confirmation.","Former US President claimed that Google CEO Sundar Pichai personally called to praise a McDonald's visit he made in Pennsylvania.

Why Microsoft Teams users globally must be careful when contacted by their company’s ‘IT staff’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-microsoft-teams-users-globally-must-be-careful-when-contacted-by-their-companys-it-staff/articleshow/114659676.cms,"How Black Basta hacking group works

Hackers are exploiting Microsoft Teams to launch sophisticated ransomware attacks against corporations globally. In a new wave of cyberattacks , criminals are impersonating corporate help desk staff to trick employees into installing malicious software , ultimately deploying the BlackBasta ransomware.According to a report by US-based cybersecurity company ReliaQuest (via Bleeping Computer), Black Basta is a ransomware operation that has been active since April 2022. The group is said to be one of the branches of the disbanded Conti cybercrime syndicate that was shut down in June 2022.Black Basta members breach corporate networks through various methods, including vulnerabilities, partnering wish malware botnets and social engineering .Previously, BlackBasta group used to flood employees' inboxes with non-malicious emails and then pose as IT help desk staff over the phone to offer assistance over ‘ongoing’ cyber attack’. The employee contacted would then be tricked into installing remote access tools like AnyDesk or enabling Windows Quick Assist, giving the attackers access to the network.Now, instead of phone calls, the attackers are utilising Microsoft Teams to contact employees. They impersonate IT help desk personnel through external user accounts with deceptive display names like “Help Desk.”""These external users set their profiles to a 'DisplayName' designed to make the targeted user think they were communicating with a help-desk account,"" the report says.""In almost all instances we've observed, the display name included the string 'Help Desk,' often surrounded by whitespace characters, which is likely to center the name within the chat. We also observed that, typically, targeted users were added to a 'OneOnOne' chat,"" it added.They also create a convincing illusion of legitimacy, leading employees to believe they are interacting with internal support staff. Once the contact is established, the attackers then trick employees into installing remote access tools or enabling Quick Assist, eventually having access to the company system.","Hackers are exploiting Microsoft Teams to launch sophisticated ransomware attacks against corporations globally.
