The letter, dated May 16, 2024, expresses concerns that DeepMind's AI technology is being used for warfare purposes, potentially violating Google's own AI principles.The letter specifically references Google's defence contract with the Israeli military, known as Project Nimbus , as well as reports of AI being used for mass surveillance and target selection in Gaza. While not focusing on any particular conflict, the signatories emphasise that their concerns are about upholding ethical AI practices .""Any involvement with military and weapon manufacturing impacts our position as leaders in ethical and responsible AI, and goes against our mission statement and stated AI Principles,"" the letter states, according to Time.When Google acquired DeepMind in 2014, it promised that the lab's technology would never be used for military or surveillance purposes. DeepMind’s AI principles prohibit working on applications that cause “overall harm” or aid in building weapons or technology intended to cause injury. However, as DeepMind has been integrated more closely with Google's core operations, this separation has become less distinct.The letter calls on DeepMind's leadership to investigate claims of military use of Google Cloud services, terminate military access to DeepMind technology, and establish a new governance body to prevent future military applications.As of August 2024, Google has not substantially responded to the employees' concerns, Time reports. ""We have received no meaningful response from leadership,"" one employee told the magazine, ""and we are growing increasingly frustrated.""A Google spokesperson defended the company's practices, stating, ""When developing AI technologies and making them available to customers, we comply with our AI Principles, which outline our commitment to developing technology responsibly.""This internal dissent follows a previous protests against Project Nimbus, which resulted in Google firing dozens of employees earlier this year.","About 200 employees at Google DeepMind, the company’s AI division's, have signed an open letter urging the company to end its contracts with military organisations.

US-based software major Cognizant TriZetto has filed a lawsuit against Indian tech giant Infosys in a Texas federal court.

New Jersey-based Cognizant has 70% employees based out of India.Infosys has vehemently denied these allegations and has vowed to defend itself in court.“Infosys is aware of the lawsuit. We deny all allegations and will defend our position in the court,” an Infosys spokesperson said.Cognizant claims that Infosys unlawfully extracted data from its databases and used this information to develop and market competing software. According to the Cognizant's complaint, Infosys misused TriZetto's software to create ""Test Cases for Facets,"" which improperly repackaged TriZetto's data into an Infosys product. Additionally, in the complaint, Cognizant also said that Infosys broke the law by creating software to extract data from QNXT that includes confidential TriZetto information and trade secrets.Cognizant's software includes TriZetto's Facets and QNXT, used by healthcare insurance companies to automate administrative tasks.Cognizant is seeking unspecified monetary damages and an injunction to prevent Infosys from continuing to misuse its trade secrets.

What researchers said about the malware



Security researchers have uncovered a new malware threat targeting macOS users . Dubbed "" Cthulhu Stealer ,"" the malware impersonates popular apps to steal sensitive information such as system passwords , iCloud Keychain credentials, and cryptocurrency wallet data.According to a report by The Hacker News, this new malware has been available to attackers since 2023 as a $500/month paid service.The report also claims that the Cthulhu Stealer can be effective as it can disguise itself as legitimate software very well.As per the report, the Cthulhu Stealer malware targets macOS users by posing as legitimate software programs such as CleanMyMac, Grand Theft Auto IV, and Adobe GenP tool that hat patches Adobe apps to bypass the Creative Cloud service and activates them without a serial key.Once executed, the malware prompts users to enter their system password, iCloud Keychain passwords, and MetaMask credentials.Cthulhu Stealer also harvests system information and web browser cookies before exfiltrating the stolen data to a remote server. The malware's ability to bypass security measures and its data-stealing capabilities make it a significant threat to macOS users.While the threat actors behind Cthulhu Stealer may no longer be active, still the malware itself poses a significant risk to macOS users, the report adds. Due to the relative security of macOS compared to Windows and Linux, users may be more likely to bypass Gatekeeper protections, making them vulnerable to such threats.To protect against Cthulhu Stealer and other malware, users should prioritise downloading apps from known sources like the Mac App Store or official developer websites. Avoiding unsigned files and exercising caution when prompted to enter sensitive information can also help mitigate the risk of infection.So, before bypassing macOS Gatekeeper to open a downloaded app, users should ensure that it's coming from a trustworthy source.",Malware known as Cthulhu Stealer impersonates popular apps to steal sensitive information.

Tensor G4, Gemini and more AI inside

Upgraded cameras with the new 'Add me' AI feature for photos

Google has launched its second-generation Pixel foldable phone, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold , which is its first-ever foldable phone in India. The second-gen Pixel Fold upgrades on some salient aspects over the first one. Per Google, the foldable is slim, super durable, and has a brighter screen, both on the outside and inside. And, the phone also packs in Pixel’s “fastest, most powerful” Tensor G4 chip , bringing on-device multimodal capabilities to the phone.On the inside, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold comes equipped with an 8 inches ‘Super Actua Flex display,’ an LTPO panel with a 2922x1344 resolution at 486 PPI. The inner screen has a dynamic refresh rate of 1-120Hz and can go as bright as 3,000 nits, which Google says is 80% brighter than the screen on the first-gen Pixel Fold. To make use of phone’s large inner canvas, there’s a split-screen mode that’ll let you use two apps side-by-side.When unfolded, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold can be used a regular phone with a 6.3 inches outer screen, which has the same specs as the inner screen.Google says that the Pixel 9 Pro Fold has an “all-new” hinge that is made from stainless steel and has an aerospace grade aluminium alloy cover. The hinge has a polished finish, while the back has the silky matt finish. The phone is rated IPX8 for water resistivity. And there’s Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the outside.Powering the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is Google’s Tensor G4 chip, also found on the other three Pixel 9 phones. The chip comes paired with 16GB of RAM and up to 1TB storage. Then, there’s theTitan M2 security coprocessor , which enables multi-layer hardware security.There’s a 5,060mAh battery, which Google promises will last for over 24 hours and up to 100 hours with Extreme Battery Saver. The phone supports fast charging at 45W, which should fill up the battery up to 55% in about 30 minutes. FYI, the charger isn’t included in the box. The phone also supports Qi wireless charging and Battery Share, i.e., reverse wireless charging.Out-of-the-box the Pixel 9 Pro Fold will come with Android 14 . There’s the usual Google promise of 7 years of OS and security updates.Would it even be a Pixel phone, if there’s no AI in it. Well, there’s a whole lot of AI. For starters Gemini is there, and it works in split-screen mode, as well. One could ask Gemini to write stuff or even get info about whats’s on the screen or photos. Circle To Search is also there, ohh and this feature can help you check if an image has been created using AI.The new “Pixel-exclusive” AI feature to arrive is Pixel Screenshots. The feature could organise or recall things, like events and location, all you need to is ask the phone.Google is giving one year of the Google One AI Premium plan for free to those who’ll buy the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. So, that’ll give you access to Gemini Advanced, Gemini in Gmail and Docs, on top of 2TB of cloud storage.The Pixel 9 Pro Fold ditches the camera visor for a squircle module that houses a triple lens setup – a 50MP wide camera, a 48MP ultraide and a 48MP 5x telephoto camera. For selfies, there's a 42 MP front-facing camera on the inner screen and 10MP camera on the outside.The camera hardware has been only a part of Pixel’s camera, but it’s AI that completes it. There’s a long list of AI features that complements the camera hardware on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. The usual Super Res Zoom, Zoom Enhance, Video Boost, Face Unblur, Photo Unblur, Best Take, Magic Eraser, Audio Eraser, and Magic Editor makes their return. Well, Magic Eraser now has an a “reimagine” feature that Google says can give photos a “whole new look.”One new AI tool to come to Google’s Pixel 9 pro Fold is the “Add Me,” which as you’d image can add you to a picture. So, how does it work? Well, you take photo with the group, swap in yourself, and AI will merge the photos.Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold is priced in India at Rs 1,72,999 and will be available for purchase later this year.

GM recently faced a few software incidents

General Motors is laying off more than 1,000 salaried employees globally in its software and services division, the company confirmed earlier this week. The job cuts , which include about 600 positions at GM's tech campus near Detroit, come as part of a review to streamline operations in the unit.""As we build GM's future, we must simplify for speed and excellence, make bold choices, and prioritise the investments that will have the greatest impact,"" GM said in a statement to CNBC.The layoffs represent approximately 1.3% of GM's global salaried workforce of 76,000 as of the end of 2023. The cuts primarily affect the automaker's US operations. Impacted employees were notified Monday morning.""We are grateful to those who helped establish a strong foundation that positions GM to lead moving forward,"" the automaker added in its statement.""As a result, we're reducing certain teams within the Software and Services organisation,"" GM stated. The division, currently led by executives Baris Cetinok and Dave Richardson, covers areas such as vehicle infotainment, OnStar services, and GM's Super Cruise advanced driver-assist system.The change comes less than six months after leadership shifts in the unit, including the departure of former Apple executive Mike Abbott in March due to health reasons.The job cuts follow GM's efforts to reduce costs amid industry concerns of a potential downturn and significant investments in electric vehicles and software-defined vehicles. GM has recently faced challenges with software issues in its new Chevy Blazer EV, including blank infotainment screens and charging error messages. The company issued a stop sale notice last December due to these problems, which was lifted in March.The layoffs also come after GM cancelled its ""Ultra Cruise"" programme, a competitor to Tesla's Full Self-Driving system, in January. The company merged the FSD team with its regular Super Cruise team.Despite the layoffs and recent setbacks, the company says it continues to work on expanding its hands-free driving system, with plans to broaden its capabilities by the end of 2025.","GM is laying off more than 1,000 salaried employees globally in its software and services division.

A UK-based YouTuber named Miles Routledge has faced backlash after he made several racist remarks targeting Indians on the social media platform X (earlier known as Twitter). It all started with a meme video that he uploaded on X as a joke. The video showed alleged nuclear missiles coming out of hidden silos in the US and a worldwide nuclear war.While sharing the video he wrote: “When I become prime minister of England, I'll open the nuclear silos as an explicit warning to any foreign power that interferes with British interests and affairs.I'm not talking huge incidents, I'm itching to launch and atomise entire nations over the smallest infraction.”A few minutes later Routledge added a comment to the post as he said:After sharing the post, he also responded to the comments made from a troll account which is now unavailable.“Saar I will see you soon saar,” Routledge said replying to the troll's commentsIn another reply, Routledge wrote:He also started receiving threatening DMs from the troll. Assuming that the trolling account may belong to an Indian, he started replying to the X profile with racist remarks against Indians. He shared a screenshot of DMs shared between him and the troll.“Indian threatens to find me, it backfires lmao,” he wrote captioning the screenshot. The image also included the YouTuber’s location and description of his clothes as he challenged the troll to come find him. Since then, the post has received more than 5 million views.In separate posts, he also shared his entire conversation as well as the profile details of the trolling account (which later became unavailable) on the platform.Here’s the full conversation between Routledge and the troll:Routledge’s remarks against Indians have drawn criticism. When another X user accused him of rage-baiting, he explained why he thought the troll threatening him was an Indian.He wrote:",UK-based YouTuber named Miles Routledge has faced backlash after he made several racist remarks targeting Indians.

In a surprising verdict, a Pune district court has dismissed a 13-year-old lawsuit filed by the American fast-food chain Burger King Corporation against a locally-owned eatery with the same name. The US company had accused the Pune-based Burger King of trademark infringement and sought a permanent injunction, damages, and a halt to the use of the name. The court dismissed the lawsuit filed by the Burger King Corporation in 2011, seeking a permanent injunction restraining infringement of trademark.However, the court ruled in favor of the local eatery, stating that it had been operating under the name ""Burger King"" since 1991-92, well before the US chain entered the Indian market.The plaintiff's first Indian BURGER KING restaurant was opened in New Delhi on November 9, 2014, the court said.The court found no evidence to support Burger King Corporation's claim that customers were confused or misled by the local eatery's use of the name. Additionally, the company failed to prove any actual financial loss due to the alleged infringement. The court said the Burger King Corporation has ""miserably failed"" to prove that the eatery here had infringed its trademark Burger King while running the restaurant in Pune.Burger King filed the lawsuit against Anahita Irani and Shapoor Irani. The Iranis opposed the suit, saying it was filed with malafide intentions and to discourage business people who are bonafide users and retailers. They said that apart from the name Burger King, there was absolutely no similarity in the plaintiff's trademark and their own shop name.This decision may have implications for trademark disputes involving established local businesses and multinational corporations.The Pune-based restaurant owners had counterclaimed for damages due to the harassment they endured during the lengthy legal battle. They sought Rs 20 lakh as damages. The court, however, refused any monetary relief to them too, noting that apart from oral evidence, no other proof was submitted to substantiate their claims.","Pune court dismisses 13-year-old lawsuit filed by Burger King Corporation.
