US vs Google ad tech trial: What is “parking” that YouTube CEO Neal Mohan explained during hearing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/us-vs-google-ad-tech-trial-what-is-parking-that-youtube-ceo-neal-mohan-explained-during-hearing/articleshow/113436779.cms,"What the government is saying

What is “parking” that the DoJ is alleging

The US vs Google advertising hearing entered the second week on September 16. The ongoing antitrust lawsuit, filed by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) against Google in 2023, focuses on Google's alleged dominance in the digital advertising technology (ad tech) market. The trial kicked off with YouTube CEO Neal Mohan testifying that Google's success is driven by innovation and not by crushing rivals.Defending Google's ad tech practices, Mohan refuted accusations by the DoJ that the company crushed rivals as it became an advertising behemoth. He said that the search giant faced tough competition in the ad tech market, and the accusations were not to crush the competition but to enhance the services and tools offered by the company to its business customers, including publishers and advertisers.Google’s success “falls back to one single thing: product innovation and the sale and services we were able to offer,” Mohan said in his testimony.Lawyers for the Justice Department highlighted emails, memos and other documents alleging that Google removed the competition through acquisitions of rivals – such as DoubleClick and ad tech tool competitor AdMeld - because it was a threat. The government sees it as evidence that Google was trying to take a competition out, as per The Verge.Justice Department lawyer Aaron Teitelbaum pointed out a 2010 email that Mohan wrote about Google acquiring AdMeld, then “parking” it within the company. Mohan joined Google as part of its acquisition of the advertising software company DoubleClick in 2008.“If you bought one and parked it, it would let us solve the problems from a position of strength,” replied the recipient, a fellow Google employee.Mohan clarified that “parking” the company didn’t mean it will stop offering services. “That’s absolutely not what was going on,” he said.He said that Google's interest in Admeld stemmed from its advanced development, but assured that Google had no plans to abandon the product. He explained that ""parking"" an acquired company means allowing it to function independently while Google gradually integrates its technology. This process can take years.Ultimately, he stated, Google’s goal was to ""build the best advertising stack for publishers, as well as tools for advertisers.""",The US vs Google advertising hearing entered the second week on September 16.

Salesforce partners with Google Cloud, AWS, IBM and more to distribute agents

Salesforce has launched Agentforce Partner Network – the world’s first AI agent ecosystem that will allow its partner companies to build third-party AI agents and actions, which then can be used to take on specific tasks depending on the requirements of businesses.In easier words, Salesforce’s Agentforce Partner Network is like an app store for AI assistants/ agents from where customers will be able to easily install these agents and deploy them for specialised industry or business needs.According to Brian Millham, president and COO at Salesforce, the company aims to enable customers with a billion AI agents over the next year.Imagine a really smart digital assistant that can do a bunch of tasks, like answering customer questions or helping you find new sales leads. That's basically an AI agent. AI agents are specifically designed to perform various tasks autonomously, such as reasoning, data retrieval, planning and action execution. For example, an AI agent can be developed specifically to take care of tasks related to employees’ leaves in an organisation, so HRs and managers can easily distribute their time in other works.The Agentforce Partner Network allows these AI agents to interface with multiple systems, databases, and other agents, addressing the complexity of enterprise environments where thousands of applications are typically managed.The platform not only allows customers to access a catalogue of third-party skills, actions and agents within the Salesforce Platform, but also develop new skills to make AI agents even more capable or use available templates to create new agents.Salesforce has announced that the AI agents from Agentforce Partner Network can be accessed and downloaded from partner platforms like Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud , Honeywell, IBM, Zoom, and more.","Salesforce partners with Google Cloud, AWS, IBM and more to distribute agents.

Elon Musk praised Ratan Tata

The legacy of the Tata Nano

Also read

In the realm of business and innovation, few figures command as much respect as Tata Group chairman emeritus Ratan Tata. His influence extends far beyond the Indian corporate world, even garnering admiration from Tesla CEO and X owner Elon Musk . In a 2009 interview with American journalist Charlie Rose , Musk praised Ratan Tata as a ""gentleman and a scholar."" This moment has recently resurfaced, shedding light on Musk's appreciation for Ratan Tata and his ambitious project, the Tata Nano .The Tata Nano was introduced by Tata Motors in 2008 as the world's cheapest car, with a price tag of just Rs 1 lakh (approximately $2,300 at the time). The car was a pet project of Ratan Tata, designed to make automobile ownership accessible to millions of Indians who had never been able to afford a car. The idea was revolutionary—a small, affordable car that would cater to the vast Indian middle class, providing them with a safe and efficient means of transportation.In the interview with Charlie Rose, which took place shortly after the launch of the Tata Nano, the Tesla CEO was asked about his views on Ratan Tata’s efforts to introduce a low-cost car in India. The interview clip, which has recently gone viral, captures Musk's candid response.""Take for a moment Ratan Tata, what he’s doing in India — developing a little sedan for $2300. Where do you put that in the whole equation of where the future of cars is?"" asked Rose.Musk responded with a mix of admiration and caution. He began by acknowledging the brilliance behind the Tata Nano project and the character of Ratan Tata himself.""I think it's a good idea to have affordable cars, but I think the problem with something like the Nano ... I wouldn't say problem because I think, by the way, it is probably a great idea and Ratan is a gentleman and scholar,"" Musk said.However, Musk also expressed his concerns about the long-term viability of such a low-cost vehicle, particularly in the context of rising fuel prices. He pointed out that while the initial purchase cost of the Nano was remarkably low, the cost of running the car—particularly fuel costs—could become a significant issue as gasoline prices continued to rise.""But where it’s going to become challenging in the future is when the price of gasoline rises, the cost of acquiring the car is much less of an issue than the cost of running the car,"" the billionnaire explained.Despite the initial excitement surrounding the Tata Nano, the car faced numerous challenges. One of the most significant issues was its branding. While the Nano was intended to be an affordable vehicle for the masses, it was often labeled as ""cheap"" rather than ""affordable."" This perception problem, combined with safety concerns and competition from other small cars, led to unimpressive sales figures.The Nano’s production was ultimately discontinued in 2018, marking the end of what was initially seen as a groundbreaking project. The car's journey from inception to discontinuation is often cited as one of the biggest marketing failures in the automobile industry.","The Tata Nano was introduced by Tata Motors in 2008 as the world's cheapest car, with a price tag of just Rs 1 lakh (approximately $2,300 at the time) The car was a pet project of Ratan Tata, designed to make automobile ownership accessible to millions of Indians who had never been able to afford a car.

What she wants in a husband

Online reactions and viral response

Also read

A woman’s detailed list of requirements for a future husband has gone viral on social media, sparking widespread reactions. Her profile, shared on X (formerly known as Twitter), includes her own personal details such as her salary, education, and a bold set of expectations for her ideal partner. The unusual demands have generated a mixture of amusement, criticism, and debate among users online.The woman, who earns Rs 1.3 lakh per annum and holds a Bachelor of Education (B.Ed) degree, has raised eyebrows by seeking a techie groom with an annual income of Rs 30 lakh.She further outlined her preferences, stating that her ideal partner should be settled in India, the US, or Europe and should own a spacious 3BHK home. Her love for luxury is evident in her desire to travel frequently and stay in 5-star hotels, which she expects to continue after marriage.The post was shared on X with the caption, “Her qualities and salary. Expected husband’s qualities and salary,” emphasising the stark difference between her modest income and her high expectations for a spouse.Beyond financial expectations, the woman’s list includes several personal and lifestyle requirements. She currently lives with her parents, whom she describes as dependent on her, and expects her future husband to accommodate them in a large independent house. She also made it clear that she is not willing to take on traditional household chores due to her professional commitments, and therefore, she expects her partner to provide a full-time cook and maid.Moreover, she expressed her passion for travel, stating that her husband should share her enthusiasm for exploring the world. She also mentioned that she does not believe in joint family living arrangements and expects her in-laws to reside separately.The profile has garnered over 1.2 million views and has sparked a lively conversation on social media. Many users were shocked by the wide gap between her salary of Rs 1.3 lakh and her demand for a partner earning Rs 30 lakh. Some users questioned the feasibility of her lifestyle expectations, pointing out the disparity between her income and her desire for luxury experiences like 5-star hotels.One user humorously remarked, “She makes Rs 11,000 a month, but she wants a full-time maid and cook? Talk about next-level priorities!” Another comment highlighted the irony, stating, “132000 per annum salary and her hobby is 5-star hotels? And surprise me with Louis Vuitton—that was the highlight.""Others were puzzled by her specific relationship expectations, such as her demand for an unmarried man despite her being divorced, and her insistence that her parents live with her while her in-laws live separately. One user commented, “She’s divorced but wants an unmarried man. Her parents will stay with her, but no in-laws allowed—how fair is that?”While the post has mostly drawn criticism and amusement, it has also led to broader discussions about societal expectations in marriage. Some users defended the woman’s right to have her own preferences, with one person writing, “Everyone is entitled to have their own expectations, but they should be realistic about what they offer in return.” However, the majority of responses leaned towards disbelief, with one user summing up the sentiment by saying, “She will be single if she continues like this.”","A woman's detailed list of requirements for a future husband has gone viral on social media.

Spam and phishing message menace grows in India

What the government’s directive says

Bharti Airtel CEO Gopal Vittal has written a letter to the heads of Reliance Jio , Vodafone Idea , state-run Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd ( BSNL ) and Tata Teleservices, says a report in the Economic Times. In the letter, Vittal proposed creating a collaborative system for sharing information about corporate connections used for commercial calling. This collaborative approach is aimed to monitor and prevent the misuse of these connections.""We are ready to take the first step and share the data (entity name and active numbers only) in the same template on a monthly basis and we would appreciate your support,"" Vittal said in the letter.The letter was sent to Reliance Jio MD Pankaj Pawar, Vodafone Idea CEO Akshaya Moondra, BSNL CMD Robert Ravi and Tata Teleservices MD Harjit Singh Chauhan.""As the telecom industry continues to face the growing challenge of UCC , it has become clear that despite ongoing efforts, more robust and unified mechanisms are required to protect our customers from this persistent issue,"" Vittal said in the letter. He also stressed that in line with the directives of Trai and DoT, the focus remains on finding effective solutions to curb UCC.UCC in the telecom industry means Unsolicited Commercial Communications that describes the combination of communications and collaboration technologies.""We strongly believe that tackling this issue should be a joint endeavour among all telecom operators, rather than isolated efforts,"" he said.Telecom operators must take ""collective responsibility"" in preventing UCC by ensuring that their networks are not exploited by spammers, especially through corporate connections that may be unintentionally facilitating such activities, he said.""Today, enterprise customers are served by multiple operators, and we are seized of the fact that any independent efforts to address spam may not be in the best interests of customers, as it may impact the quality and continuity of services,"" Vittal added.According to industry data, 1.5-1.7 billion commercial messages are sent every day in India, taking the total to about 55 billion every month. As per a survey by community social media platform Local Circles, six in 10 consumers get three or more spam calls each day, with financial services and real estate said to be top offenders. In another survey, 76% consumers said that they get three or more spam messages daily.

How the internet reacted

ChatGPT , developed by Microsoft-backed OpenAI , was recently mired into controversy after reports surfaced of the AI chatbot initiating conversations with users without any prompt. The company has since announced that the underlying issue has been addressed.According to a report by Futurism, OpenAI has acknowledged the problem and said it had issued a fix.“We addressed an issue where it appeared as though ChatGPT was starting new conversations. This issue occurred when the model was trying to respond to a message that didn't send properly and appeared blank. As a result, it either gave a generic response or drew on ChatGPT's memory,” the company told the publication.In what can be called a strange incident, Redditor ""SentuBill"" claimed that ChatGPT initiated a conversation without him asking any question. The person also shared a screenshot of the AI bot conversation which shows the asking, “How was your first week in high school? Did you settle in well?”.The user then responded, “Did you just message me first?” to which, the AI chatbot replied “Yes, I did! I wanted to check in and see how things went in the first week of high school”. It further added ""If you would rather initiate the conversation yourself, just let me know”.The post took the internet by storm, leaving users amazed and shocked.One user commented, “Weird. Surprisingly, I like it. It feels nice when interest is shown in me, even when it's by an AI,” capturing the unexpected positive sentiment.Another added a playful observation: “I love how it keeps trying to give an out like it wants to talk to you, but it's self-conscious and anxious about being a bother. I think GPT has a lil crush.”“I noticed yesterday how it was extremely more conversational and asking me stuff even though I didn't specify that it should. I like it,” a third user commented.Some users shared similar experiences. One user said, “I got this this week! I asked it last week about some health symptoms I had. And this week, it messages me, asking how I'm feeling and how my symptoms are progressing! Freaked me out.”","ChatGPT, developed by Microsoft-backed OpenAI, was recently mired into controversy after reports surfaced of the AI chatbot initiating conversations with users without any prompt.

Oracle co-founder and chairman Larry Ellison has expressed a strong desire to acquire more Nvidia GPUs.

Ellison reportedly said, ""I would describe the dinner as me and Elon begging Jensen for GPUs.""He added that they told Huang, ""Please take our money….we need you to take more of our money,"" before he quipped, ""It went OK, it worked.""One of the world's richest billionaires, Ellison emphasized the importance of GPUs in building and training AI models , stating that the race to develop these models will be a significant investment over the next five years.Oracle has even secured permits to build three nuclear reactors to power a data center that will house a supercomputer equipped with up to 131,072 Nvidia Blackwell GPUs.During Oracle's second-quarter earnings call last December — for its fiscal year 2024 — Ellison said his company provided Musk's startup xAI with GPUs to train its model Grok. He said, ""They got that up and running, but boy did they want a lot more GPUs than we gave them; we're in the process of getting them more.""Ellison noted that xAI's demand for GPUs exceeded Oracle's initial allocation.Beyond the technical implications, Ellison also discussed the potential societal impact of AI. He predicted that AI could be used to monitor citizens, supervise police officers, and report misconduct. Ellison suggested that this constant surveillance could lead to a more compliant society.","Oracle co-founder and chairman Larry Ellison has expressed a strong desire to acquire more Nvidia GPUs.

Specific Skills, Higher Demand

Apprenticeships on the Rise

Salary Stagnation for Standard Degrees

What Companies Are Doing

The big message for BTech graduates

The game has changed for fresh engineering graduates in India. Companies are looking beyond just a B.Tech degree. According to a report in Economic Times, ""‘Extra’ is now the new byword in hiring of engineering freshers as campus recruiters vie for candidates who have that little extra topping on their plain vanilla B.Tech degree. This topping could be a skill in emerging technologies like AI, ML or IoT, or an apprenticeship or internship at some firm.""The report claims that this trend is reflected in salaries.While the average starting package for engineers has remained flat for standard BTech graduates in recent years, those with additional skills are seeing a significant boost – a 10% increase reported by staffing firm TeamLease .""Those who've actively learned new technologies or gained experience through apprenticeships are not only getting hired faster, but also commanding higher salaries,"" told Krishna Vij, business head of IT staffing at TeamLease Digital, to ET.The numbers speak for themselves. The average salary for a fresh engineer is Rs 3.8-4.5 lakh per year, but for those with skills in emerging technologies, it jumps to Rs 7-10 lakh annually.Universities are adapting to this new normal. Campuses are buzzing with companies seeking ""knowledgeable and well-trained"" graduates, as highlighted by Harish Kumar, head of mechanical and aerospace engineering at the National Institute of Technology , Delhi.These sought-after candidates have either completed internships lasting 6-12 months, undergone specialized training, or tackled real-world projects in areas like data science, AI/ML, or cybersecurity. Companies are willing to pay a premium for this experience, offering salaries 75% to 150% higher than those without such exposure.Specific skills are in high demand at some universities. Amity University, for example, reports a surge in interest for students with expertise in cloud computing solutions like AWS, service management tools like ServiceNow, and cybersecurity. ""Students with a B.Tech in Cybersecurity are fetching a CTC (cost-to-company) exceeding Rs 15 lakh, while the average salary for a general B.Tech graduate is Rs 6 to 6.5 lakh per year,"" says Anjani Bhatnagar, the university's technical placement head.A similar story unfolds at SRM Institute of Science and Technology. Their Career Centre Director, N Venkata Sastry, observes a significant rise in recruitment by global capability centers, particularly those seeking graduates with specializations in new technologies. ""These skills are a clear differentiator for employability, and the salaries reflect that,"" he adds.Data from staffing firms like Xpheno and Quess confirms this trend. Kapil Joshi, deputy CEO at Quess IT Staffing, attributes the rise in apprenticeship hiring to companies' desire to reduce costs, build skilled talent pools, and foster employee loyalty. Quess data shows a staggering 10x increase in apprenticeship hiring by IT companies in the eight months leading up to August 2024 compared to the same period in 2023.Looking back, Xpheno's research reveals that average salaries for fresh engineers have seen only a small increase in the past decade, moving from Rs 3-3.4 lakh per year in 2013-14 to Rs 3.8-4.5 lakh in 2023-24. ""Average fresher salaries remain below Rs 5 lakh per annum in the Indian IT sector,"" says Prasadh M S, head of workforce research at Xpheno. Offers ranging from Rs 3.8 to 4.5 lakh are most common, with some even falling below Rs 3.5 lakh.While major IT companies like Cognizant , HCLTech, Infosys, and TCS did not respond to inquiries, Wipro provided details on their ""Work Integrated Learning Programme (WILP)"" for BSc and BCA graduates. This program combines studies with practical experience through Wipro's academies, and successful graduates have the opportunity to become full-time employees.The message for fresh engineering graduates is clear: A basic B.Tech degree is no longer enough. Equipping yourself with in-demand skills or real-world experience can significantly boost your employability and earning potential. So, take that extra step, gain that extra edge, and stand out from the crowd.","According to a report in Economic Times, 'Extra' is now the new byword in hiring of engineering freshers.

How losing Sony's PlayStation 6 deal to AMD may have dealt another ‘big blow' to Intel,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-losing-sonys-playstation-6-deal-to-amd-may-have-dealt-another-big-blow-to-intel/articleshow/113396961.cms,"Intel lost out on a contract to design and manufacture the chip for Sony 's upcoming PlayStation 6 console in 2022, dealing a significant setback to its fledgling contract manufacturing business, Reuters reported, citing three sources familiar with the matter.The contract, which could have generated approximately $30 billion in revenue for Intel, was awarded to rival Advanced Micro Devices ( AMD ) after a competitive bidding process that eliminated other contenders such as Broadcom, according to the sources.Intel and AMD were the final two contenders for the lucrative deal, which would have involved designing the chip for the forthcoming PlayStation 6 and using Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) as the contract manufacturer. The business would have amounted to fabricating thousands of silicon wafers a month, two sources told Reuters.The loss represents a missed opportunity for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger 's turnaround plan, which centred on creating a foundry unit. Gelsinger announced plans for Intel's contract manufacturing effort in 2021 and formally launched it in February 2024.According to Reuters, the deal fell through due to disagreements over profit margins, despite months of negotiations that included meetings between the CEOs, executives, and dozens of engineers from both companies.Sources said winning the PlayStation 6 chip contract would have provided Intel with a steady stream of business, potentially occupying its foundry unit for over five years. The deal could have also helped attract other major clients to Intel's advanced 18A manufacturing process.The setback comes at a challenging time for Intel, which recently announced plans to cut 15% of its workforce and reduce capital spending on factory expansion. The company reported $7 billion in operating losses for its manufacturing businesses in the first quarter of this year.Sony has not yet officially announced the PlayStation 6. The company recently unveiled the PlayStation 5 Pro and reported sales of 20.8 million first-generation PlayStation 5 systems in fiscal 2023.Typically, Sony consoles sell more than 100 million units across half a decade. The PlayStation 2, launched in 2000, sold approximately 150 million units over its lifetime.Intel, Sony, and Broadcom did not respond to requests for comment, while AMD declined to comment, Reuters reported.",Intel and AMD were the final two contenders for the lucrative deal.
