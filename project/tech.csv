Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company , or TSMC , recently surpassed $1 trillion in market capitalisation after Morgan Stanley analysts boosted price targets on the chipmaker before its earnings next week. The Taiwanese chipmaker overtook Berkshire Hathaway earlier in June to become the world‚Äôs eighth most valuable company, based on its ADRs.A report by Business Insider pointed out that an increase in demand of Nvidia‚Äôs AI chips helped the Apple chip supplier to touch this milestone.This comes about a month after reports said that TSMC is planning to charge more from Nvidia which has reaped the benefits of the recent Al boom, making it one of the world's most valuable companies after Microsoft and Apple.TSMC is the sole production partner for Nvidia's most advanced Al training chips, including its latest Blackwell line. As per the data by CitiGroup , nearly 90% of the world's most advanced processor chips are produced by the Taiwanese major.TSMC CEO CC Wei told reporters that he talked to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang about expensive chips.‚ÄúI did complain to Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang -- the 'three trillion guy' -- that his products are so expensive. I think those products are really valuable for sure, but I am thinking about showing [him] our values as well. Anyone sitting at home can think [up this strategy],‚Äù he said.During TSMC's first-quarter earnings call in April, the CEO said that the company is planning to charge customers more if they want their chips made outside Taiwan. ‚ÄúWe expect our customers to share some of the higher cost with us, and we [have] already started our discussion with our customers,‚Äù he said.Not only TSMC, Dutch company ASML , the equipment supplier to the Taiwanese chipmaker, is also reaping the benefits of Nvidia's meteoric rise. Its shares also got a boost, briefly crossing 1,000 euros, or $1,082, apiece for the first time this week.",Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company recently surpassed $1 trillion in market capitalisation.

"Elon Musk: X user questions company‚Äôs policy on DMs, Elon Musk responds",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/social/x-user-questions-companys-policy-on-dms-elon-musk-responds/articleshow/111607266.cms,"What the change in policy says

X (formerly) rolled out encryption for direct messages ( DMs ) last year, however, for this to be implemented both the sender and recipient must be verified. An X user recently highlighted a change in company policy, raising privacy concerns. This update essentially contradicts X's previous policy of guaranteeing end-to-end encryption for all user content.As per the screenshot shared by the user, the change in policy allows X to manually review DMs for investigations into reported violations, service misuse and legal or government requests.‚ÄúKeeping you safer in Direct Messages,‚Äù the policy reads.‚ÄúX systems scan shared links and media for spam, abuse, and prohibited content. We also analyze usage patterns to detect suspicious behavior and improve your experience. We may manually review DMs to investigate reported violations and misuse of our service, or to comply with laws or governmental requests. See our Privacy Policy for more details,‚Äù it added.The user asked, ‚ÄúWhat happened to encrypted DMs?‚Äù to which Musk replied, ‚ÄúIt currently works in a clunky way for one to one messages (if you turn it on). We‚Äôre working on making it easy to use and apply to group messages too.‚Äù‚ÄúX audio and video calls are automatically encrypted,‚Äù he added.The user then responded by saying: ‚ÄúUnderstood. Is there a reason why encryption can‚Äôt be turned on by default, without manual user interaction for each party? The way it is designed now results in 99% of messages being unencrypted. X should do better than other messengers. You called out WhatsApp for being unsafe.‚ÄùAnother user questioned Musk‚Äôs ability to understand the question.‚ÄúIs it me or did Elon not understand the question of Kim? Kim was worried about reviewing the DMs by government request.‚Äù","An X user recently highlighted a change in company policy, raising privacy concerns.
