A Bengaluru man recently shared a post on X (formerly Twitter ) stating how he received a laptop just 13 minutes after ordering through Flipkart Minutes . The post has now gone viral on the internet with over 2 million views so far.The viral post has now taken an interesting turn with the e-commerce company surprising him with a gift. In the X post, Sunny R Gupta @sunnykgupta said that he has received a laptop bag from Flipkart.He also shared a video of both ‚Äì the laptop and the bag.‚ÄúThey came, they clicked a picture with me, they left ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èBut they gave this cool bag, not a cheap random one, instead a Wildcraft one!,‚Äù he wrote.Replying to Gupta‚Äôs post, the official handle of Flipkart Minutes wrote ‚ÄúYes, I‚Äôm always demure and mindful ( with quick deliveries ) üòå‚Äù.However, Gupta‚Äôs post did not go well with other X users who criticized his post calling it a ‚Äòmarketing stunt‚Äô.Gupta in another post clarified that it was not a planned promotion. He said ‚ÄúI wanted to take a moment to address the recent buzz around my posts about receiving a laptop deliverywithin 13 minutes from Flipkart. I want to clarify that this was not a marketing stunt or a planned promotion.‚Äù‚ÄúDuring one of our gatherings at Starbucks , I was browsing for a new Windows laptop on Amazon and Flipkart. I stumbled upon a model on Flipkart that fit my budget and requirements, and I noticed a new feature offering delivery within 15 minutes. Intrigued by this option, I decided to try it out, thinking it would be more convenient than waiting a day for a traditional delivery,‚Äù he stated.Adding further, he wrote ‚ÄúAfter placing the order, I shared the experience live on X simply because I found it fascinating and unexpected. To my surprise, the laptop arrived in just 13 minutes, and I posted about it in real-time. The posts went viral overnight, garnering millions of views and attracting attention from various media outlets.‚Äù‚ÄúI want to emphasize that I had no incentive to create a viral moment or engaging in any marketing ploy. The posts were purely my personal experience, shared out of genuine surprise and excitement. I have a fulfilling career in software development, and I do not rely on or need to engage in marketing gimmicks for additional income. I enjoyed the attention this brought me.‚ÄùHe said that once the post became popular, Flipkart‚Äôs marketing team offered him a laptop bag for all the buzz this ended up creating.",Bengaluru man Sunny R Gupta recently shared a post on X (formerly Twitter ) stating how he received a laptop just 13 minutes after ordering through Flipkart Minutes.

"Google has been denied permission to build another data centre in Ireland, here‚Äôs why",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-has-been-denied-permission-to-build-another-data-centre-in-ireland-heres-why/articleshow/112846737.cms,"Why Google has been denied permission for new data centre

Google wanted to build another data centre in Dublin , Ireland but has been denied the permission, reports say. Google now has the option of appealing the decision to An Bord Plean√°la, the Irish planning board. The company already owns two data centres in the city.The South Dublin County Council refused the company‚Äôs plans for building a 72,000 square metre facility at the Grange Castle Business Park in south Dublin.It would have involved the creation of 50 jobs when operational, as per a report by The Irish Times.The council reportedly wrote that Google did not provide enough detail on ‚Äúhow the proposal will impact the power supply once operational‚Äù in 2027, according to the decision. It said that ‚Äúthe existing insufficient capacity in the electricity network (grid) and the lack of significant on-site renewable energy to power the data centre‚Äù were reasons for refusal.This decision comes amidst growing public opposition to data centres in Ireland, fueled by their significant energy use at a time when the country is struggling to meet its carbon emissions targets.Citing data by the Central Statistics Office, data centres used about 21% of all electricity generated in the State in 2023, compared to 5% in 2015. This figure is projected to rise to 27% by 2028 and the centres already use more power than all urban households in the State.Furthermore, Google's proposed data centre is said to have indirectly contributed 224,250 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions annually without mitigation measures.In September 2011, we announced that we would invest ‚Ç¨75 million to convert a warehouse on an industrial site in West Dublin into our third energy-efficient data centre in Europe. To date, we‚Äôve invested approximately ‚Ç¨500 million to build and operate data centres on our Dublin site.Google‚Äôs first data centre was announced in 2011 when the company converted a warehouse in Dublin, and the centre went live in 2012. The company was granted permission to build a two-story, 30,360 sqm (326,790 sq ft) data centre next to its existing facility in 2014.","South Dublin County Council refused the company‚Äôs plans for building a 72,000 square metre facility at the Grange Castle Business Park in south Dublin.

How the 'clash' started and went on ...

Zoho CEO Sridhar Vembu was recently trolled by a doctor who goes by the moniker ' TheLiverDoc ' on X, formerly known as Twitter. 'TheLiverDoc' slammed Vembu for a post on the benefits on walking barefoot. ""I have been walking bare foot in the farm for close to a year now. This thread talks about the health benefits of ""grounding"" - walking barefoot. It is easy to do, doesn't cost anything and isn't harmful - our rural people have been doing it for ages.So I reasoned why not try it and I got so used to it by now I don't even think about it. Try it!""To this 'TheLiverDoc', who has over 274K followers on Twitter, contested. ""Grounding or Earthing (via bare-foot walking) is a pseudoscientific practice. It has no clinically relevant benefits. There are a lot of absolutely nonsense wasteful studies on this topic that has contaminated the published literature,"" he wrote.The two clashed in a series of posts. Vembu called him an arrogant doctor. ""Stay away from arrogant doctors - that is the best health tip I can give anyone."" In response 'theliverdoc' called Zoho CEO ""Health illiterate boomer uncle "".Tagging the 'boomer uncle' post, Vembu wrote, ""Can we at least be original in our insults online? Is that too much to ask?"" He then went on to add that he has been insulted often online, and often called ""boomer uncle"". He went on to write what the meaning of 'boomer uncle' is and how another common insult he most often faces is ""Sanghi"".""Take the insult ""boomer"" often handed out by ""sophisticated"" young people in India. The word ""boomer"" came from ""baby boom"" in the US which refers to the post World War II period of high fertility - so boomers are the generation born between 1946-64.In the US, ""boomer"" insult is used as code by young people for ""you guys had the good jobs, the good life and piled up debt and we face bad jobs and low income now and can't even afford a house"".In India young people are better off economically than their parents at the same age. Older people in their youth had jobs that paid a pittance and had long hours. So ""boomer"" has no meaning in India.There are plenty of insults original to India - I get called ""sanghi"" and at least I am happy it is a very Indian insult! üòÅBut ""boomer"" - I say ""Guys I know you think it is sophisticated and shows you know American lingo but all it shows is that you are a mental slave to another culture, using terms with no relevance here at all"". And I technically don't even qualify as a boomer - I was born too late and I was not born in America!""","Zoho CEO Sridhar Vembu was recently trolled by a doctor who goes by the moniker'TheLiverDoc'on X, formerly known as Twitter.

This dispute has ultimately led to the company's insolvency proceedings.While the investors are not advocating for insolvency, they aim to inform the Supreme Court judges about the alleged mismanagement at Byju's. Founder and CEO Byju Raveendran has consistently denied any wrongdoing, but some investors have previously called for his removal.The Supreme Court is set to hear the insolvency case later this week.The investors' move comes after Dutch technology investor Prosus fully wrote off its investment in Byju's due to the significant decline in value for equity investors.Byjus founder Raveendran has warned that insolvency could lead to a complete shutdown of the company, affecting its 27,000 employees.

China's richest techie loses $14 billion in one day,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/chinas-richest-techie-loses-14-billion-in-one-day/articleshow/112838818.cms,"PDD falls short of estimates



PDD-owned Temu faces criticism in China and outside



The founder of the Chinese company PPD Holdings that owns e-commerce platform Temu , Colin Huang , has seen a significant drop in his net worth. Following a decline in PDD 's shares this week, Huang's fortune plummeted by $14.1 billion in a day which was also the the largest one-day loss in his career.According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, this decline has pushed Huang from the top spot to the fourth-wealthiest person in China, with a net worth of $35.2 billion.Bottled-water billionaire Zhong Shanshan has reclaimed the position of China's richest person with a net worth of $50 billion.Huang became the first tech tycoon to lead China‚Äôs wealth rankings over three years. He overtook Shanshan as his net worth reached a peak of $71.5 billion in early 2021.Huang, a former Google engineer, founded PDD in 2015 after launching several gaming and e-commerce ventures. He quickly climbed the ranks of the world‚Äôs wealthiest individuals. However, as Beijing began tightening its grip on China‚Äôs tech giants, Huang stepped down as PDD‚Äôs chief executive in 2020 and left as board chairman in 2021.PDD also saw a major decline in its share price following the release of its quarterly earnings report. The company's revenue fell short of analyst expectations, and management warned of slowing sales growth.CEO Chen Lei emphasised the unsustainable nature of PDD's current trajectory, citing increased competition from platforms like TikTok and Alibaba. The company's US-listed shares dropped by 29%, the largest single-day decline in its history.PDD-owned e-commerce platform Temu sells affordable items with major discounts. This made the platform popular among users who wanted to save money during inflation. The company opened a new store called Temu outside of China in 2022, and it also became popular in the US. Now, Temu even competes with other major e-tailers like Shein and Amazon.However, not everyone is happy with this e-commerce platform. Suppliers, workers and even governments have complained about Temu. Small business owners in China protested because they felt the company was treating them unfairly.In other countries, governments are trying to make the company pay more taxes on their cheap goods. This could make the prices of products available in Temu go up in the coming days.","Huang's fortune plummeted by $14.1 billion in a day which was also the the largest one-day loss in his career.

Why Durov left Russia in 2014

Telegram's 'controversial role' in the Ukraine war

Elon Musk comes in support of Pavel

Telegram chief executive Pavel Durov was arrested at a Paris airport for offences related to his popular messaging app. Durov was detained at Le Bourget airport in Paris after arriving on a private jet. Telegram is an encrypted messaging app, ranked as one of the major social media platforms after Facebook, YouTube, WhatsApp, Instagram , TikTok and WeChat.Durov is accused of failing to take action to curb the criminal use of his platform. He faces investigation for allegedly allowing a wide range of crimes due to a lack of moderators on Telegram and lack of cooperation with police. A cybersecurity gendarmerie unit and France 's national anti-fraud police unit are leading the investigation.Encrypted messaging app Telegram allows groups of up to 200,000 members, which has led to accusations that it makes it easier for false information to spread virally. There are also accusations that the app is used to disseminate neo-Nazi, paedophilic, conspiratorial and terrorist content. Telegram has committed to never disclosing information about its users.The 39-year-old technology billionaire Pavel Durov holds dual French and UAE citizenship and has been vocal about keeping Telegram a neutral platform. According to Russian and French media, Durov became a French citizen in 2021. Durov is estimated by Forbes to have a fortune of $15.5 billion. Telegram was created by Durov and his brother Nikolai, a programmer and mathematician. The app is said to have around 900 million active users. Durov has also accused the FBI of seeking a backdoor into Telegram.Durov reportedly left Russia in 2014 after refusing to comply with demands to shut down opposition communities on his VK social media platform. Durov, however, has not said whether he renounced his Russian citizenship.Telegram app is particularly influential in Russia, Ukraine and the republics of the former Soviet Union. Telegram has become a major source of unfiltered content from both sides of the Ukraine war. Ukrainian and Russian governments both use Telegram heavily. The platform has become what some analysts call 'a virtual battlefield' for the war, used heavily by Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and his officials, as well as the Russian government.Tesla CEO Elon Musk posted the hashtag #FreePavel on the X social media platform, formerly Twitter. He wrote in French, ""Liberte Liberte! Liberte?"" (Freedom Freedom! Freedom?). Spacex CEO also said that Facebook-owned Instagram has a massive child exploitation problem, but no arrest for its founder Mark Zuckerberg . He claimed the reason for the same is that he censors free speech and gives governments backdoor access to user data.",Telegram CEO Pavel Durov was arrested at Le Bourget airport in Paris.

Former Amazon VP: CEO of startup I worked with got me divorced,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/former-amazon-vp-ceo-of-startup-i-worked-with-got-me-divorced/articleshow/112792027.cms,"Read the complete post here

A CEO that I worked for seduced my wife in direct retaliation for my pushback on him at work. He won. I got divorced and left the company. When I say I truly understand how some executive teams can be political snake pits, I trust you will believe me. Learn from my pain - do the following:

1) When you have a good manager, lean in and take advantage of it.

2) Spot the snakes.

3) Do excellent work, even for nasty leaders.

4) Don‚Äôt confront the snakes directly

5) Don‚Äôt become a snake

1) When you have a good manager, lean in and take advantage of it.

While I ‚Äúsurvived‚Äù bad bosses, most of my career progress came while working for good, honest, and helpful managers.

Hold on to these managers as much as you can. Help them grow and succeed so that you can stay together, and you can grow and succeed with them. See success as a partnership with the people you can trust.

Ultimately, the key to my career success was excelling when I had good managers and just surviving in the periods when I did not.

Also, notice I say take advantage of ‚Äúit‚Äù, not ‚Äúthem‚Äù. Take advantage of and benefit from having a good manager.

Don‚Äôt become dishonest and take advantage of someone else for your benefit.

I recognized early on that my CEO in the divorce story was unethical and dishonest. My mistake was letting fear of a tough economy convince me to try to stay in the job and ""win"" by pushing back. It cost me far more than I ever thought it could.

Action: Do whatever you need to get to a good manager! Leave before the snake bites.

2) Spot the snakes.

Generally, it doesn‚Äôt take long to figure out who is a good person and who is only looking out for themselves.

There are so many ways to see through the dishonest people:

‚Äì See if their actions match their words

‚ÄìTalk to others who have been there longer - they know!

‚Äì Investigate their pasts - talk to someone who used to work for them but is now safely away

A smooth talker may fool you in person, particularly if you give people the benefit of the doubt. Observing carefully and doing your research can help you not fall for the charm of someone you shouldn‚Äôt trust.

Being cautious is important, but there is a big difference between being watchful and skeptical and being cynical and untrusting. Extend some trust in case your leader is a good person, but do not make yourself fully vulnerable until you know.

With the CEO I talk about, I had ""spotted the snake"" - my mistake was staying too long and getting bitten.

3), 4), and 5)

I'm out of room here. To read about why you need to do excellent work for nasty execs, why you shouldn't confront them, and about not becoming a snake yourself, subscribe to our newsletter.

Take a look a the post here:

What users said about the post



‚Äú$ is not just a currency symbol. It is embedded in many programming language syntaxes such as:

- We write variables under this ${} in javascript.

- Variables are also written like this $1, $2 in bash syntax.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe '$' is also an important character in programming languages, such as Perl,‚Äù

‚ÄúThe use of $ in global formulas has become the norm due to its widespread acceptance, but that doesn‚Äôt mean we shouldn‚Äôt advocate for our own ‚Çπ. Promoting the Indian currency, ensuring it gets the recognition it deserves in both local and international products.‚Äù

‚ÄúOnly a person who works on MS Excel knows the answer. $ is used to freeze a Row or column in Excel formulas and ‚Çπ can't do that. That's why $ is used universally for that purpose . However, you can anytime use ‚Çπ on your computer.‚Äù

‚ÄúBhavish, I recommend you ask the software engineers in your company rather than Twitter! :),‚Äù

"Why TRAI's ‚ÄòSeptember 1 deadline‚Äô for Airtel, Reliance Jio and Vodafone-Idea is ‚Äòbad news‚Äô for your OTPs",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-trais-september-1-deadline-for-airtel-reliance-jio-and-vodafone-idea-is-bad-news-for-your-otps/articleshow/112787423.cms,"What is the big change

What is Whitelisting or URLs

Similar disruption in 2021

Starting September 1, consumers might experience disruptions in receiving service and transactional messages from banks, financial institutions, and e-commerce firms on their mobile phones. This follows a directive from the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) aimed at reducing spam, particularly phishing attempts.Trai has instructed telecom companies to stop transmitting messages containing URLs, OTT links, APKs (Android application packages), or call-back numbers that are not whitelisted‚Äîregistered with telcos‚Äîby senders from September 1.This directive means that banks, financial institutions, and online platforms must register their message templates and content with operators by August 31. If they fail to do so, messages containing these elements will be blocked.Currently, entities register their headers and templates with telcos but not the content of messages. This means operators do not check the content of transmitted messages. However, starting next month, telcos must create a mechanism to read the content of commercial messages and block those that do not match their records, according to experts.In India, 1.5-1.7 billion commercial messages are sent daily, totaling about 55 billion every month, according to industry data.Airtel, Reliance Jio and Vodafone-Idea want extension in deadlineAccording to a report in Economic Times, industry executives say the telecom sector is seeking more time from Trai to implement the mandate as the blockchain-based distributed ledger technology (DLT) platform needs updating. However, the regulator believes it has given sufficient time to the telcos and is unwilling to extend the deadline, according to officials familiar with the matter.Bharti Airtel, Reliance Jio, and Vodafone Idea did not respond to ET‚Äôs queries.Whitelisting requires entities sending messages to provide all information related to URLs, call-back numbers, etc., to telcos, who will then feed the information into their DLT platform. If the information matches, the message is passed; otherwise, it is blocked.For example, most transactional messages from banks, such as funds debit or credit, contain a call-back number. Transmission of such messages will be stopped if a bank does not whitelist the number.‚ÄúOnly those entities, including banks, which whitelist their URLs or content of the messages with telcos, will pass through; the rest will be blocked,‚Äù said a telecom industry executive.Mobile consumers faced a similar outage in March 2021 when the DLT platform was implemented, and telcos started scrubbing messages. At that time, there was widespread disruption as telcos blocked all commercial messages that did not contain whitelisted headers and templates. Following the disruption, all entities have since registered their headers and templates with telcos.Experts say that in the current scenario, an increasing number of messages may shift to over-the-top (OTT) platforms like WhatsApp and Google‚Äôs rich communication services (RCS) messaging, as there is no such mandate from Trai to govern them. However, banking messages, where rules do not permit transmission over OTT, will be blocked if the entities have not been whitelisted, the experts added.","Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) has instructed telecom companies to stop transmitting messages containing URLs, OTT links, APKs, or call-back numbers that are not whitelisted by senders.

While since 2021, Google launched three Pixel series smartwatches, including the Pixel Watch 3 at the recent 'Made for Google' event, there have been two Fitbit smartwatches -- Versa 4 and Sense 2.The Fitbit Versa 4 and Sense 2 were launched just months before Google‚Äôs first Pixel Watch.Google has now confirmed that Fitbit as a brand will no longer be making new smartwatches and that the Pixel Watch series will be taking over that form factor going forward. Speaking to Engadget, Google‚Äôs director of product management for Pixel wearables, Sandeep Waraich, said, ‚ÄúPixel Watch is our smartwatch part of the portfolio‚Äù. Waraich said the same in response to a question about the future of the Fitbit-branded smartwatches, adding that Pixel Watch is ‚Äúour next iteration of smartwatch for Fitbit.‚ÄùBut while you may not get Fitbit smartwatches, Fitbit brand per se is not being killed. Google will continue to make Fitbit fitness bands . Fitbit-branded products will focus on trackers that are ‚Äúmore minimalistic‚Äù with long battery life, said Waraich.As to what happens to Fitbit smartwatch customers . Google said, ""We are very committed to Fitbit, and even more importantly to the customers that use and depend on those products and technology. It's also worth noting that many of the health and fitness features we launched in Pixel Watch 3 were because of Fitbit's innovation and ground-breaking fitness advancements. In addition, we just launched Fitbit Ace LTE , and you‚Äôll continue to see new products and innovation from Fitbit.""This means that Google will continue to provide software updates, and even new features to both devices.As for Pixel Watch fans, Google has launched Pixel Watch 3 in India, starting at RS 39,99. Pixel Watch 3 will go on sale in the country in September.","Google acquired Fitbit in 2021, since then there were speculations about the future of the brand.
