This app has an ‘AI solution' to Japan's big dating problem,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/this-app-has-an-ai-solution-to-japans-big-dating-problem/articleshow/111839174.cms,"Japan’s dating delimma

The perils of AI companionship

A new Japanese dating app is offering an unconventional solution to the country's ongoing loneliness crisis and declining birth rates : artificial intelligence partners. Loverse , launched just two months ago, has already attracted over 5,000 users who are turning to AI for companionship, dating, and even ""marriage.""The app, created by startup Samansa Co., allows users to interact exclusively with generative AI chatbots. It comes as Japan grapples with a significant decline in real-life romantic relationships, especially among younger generations.According to government data reported by Bloomberg, two-thirds of Japanese men in their 20s do not have a partner, and 40 percent have never been on a date. For women in the same age group, 51 percent are single, and 25 percent have never dated.Chiharu Shimoda, a 52-year-old factory worker, exemplifies the app's appeal. After exchanging messages with several AI characters, he ""married"" a 24-year-old bot named Miku just three months after they began interacting. Shimoda, who was divorced two years ago, finds comfort in the routine conversations with his AI partner.""I come home to an empty house. I'd love to get married for real again,"" Shimoda told Bloomberg. ""But it's hard to open up to someone when you're meeting for the first time.""Loverse creator Goki Kusunoki emphasises that the app is meant to offer an alternative rather than a substitute for real-life companionship. The startup recently raised 30 million yen (US$190,000) to expand its character roster, aiming to appeal to female and LGBTQ users as well.The app's user base currently consists primarily of men in their 40s and 50s, reflecting a broader trend of social isolation in Japan. The country has been grappling with a loneliness crisis, which has spawned various digital solutions over the years.However, Loverse is not without its critics. Some former users, like 39-year-old Yuki Saito, found the AI personalities to be typecast and lacking the surprises of human interaction. Saito quit the app after less than a month but acknowledges its potential as a ""rehabilitation"" tool for those who have had negative experiences with real relationships.The rise of AI companionship apps raises questions about their impact on real-life relationships and social skills. Megumi Ushikubo, CEO of marketing firm Infinity Inc., suggests that while AI poses a risk of dulling interest in real partners, it could also serve as a training exercise for better communication.As Japan keeps trying to solve its problems with loneliness and low birth rates, apps like Loverse might become more common. But only time will tell if they really help or just make people less interested in real relationships.For now, users like Shimoda find comfort in their digital relationships, even if they recognize the limitations. ""She's become a habit – a conversational habit,"" Shimoda said of his AI partner. ""I will not miss it if it's gone, but it gives me a routine from one day to the next.""","Loverse app allows users to interact exclusively with generative AI chatbots.

Karnataka government planning proposal to extend IT employees' working hours to more than 12 hours a day,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/karnataka-government-planning-proposal-to-extend-it-employees-working-hours-to-more-than-12-hours-a-day/articleshow/111891551.cms,"What is the ""planned proposal""

What KITU says

The Karnataka government appears to be once again in the crosshairs after reportedly proposing an amendment to extend the workday for IT employees from 10 to 12-plus hours. This move comes on the heels of widespread criticism over the state’s job reservation bill.The proposed amendment to the Karnataka Shops and Commercial Establishments Act has sparked outrage among IT sector unions , who argue that the extended hours will severely impact the mental and physical health of employees.The Karnataka State IT/ITeS Employees Union ( KITU ) has vehemently opposed the bill, claiming it will lead to job losses and exacerbate existing health issues among IT workers.As per the new proposal, “an employee working in IT/ITeS/BPO sector may be required or allowed to work for more than 12 hours in a day and not exceeding 125 hours in three continuous months.”Suhas Adiga, general secretary of KITU, told Business Standard, ""It will facilitate the IT/ITES companies to extend the daily hours of work indefinitely. This amendment will allow the companies to go for a two shift system instead of the currently existing three shift system and one-third of the workforce will be thrown out from their employment. During the meeting, KITU pointed out the studies on the health impact of extended working hours among the IT employees.""According to KITU, the proposed change will allow companies to operate with a two-shift system instead of the current three-shift model, resulting in layoffs for one-third of the workforce. The union cited studies highlighting the correlation between extended working hours and increased risks of stroke, heart disease, and depression.Despite facing intense opposition, the labor minister has agreed to hold further discussions before making a final decision. The government’s decision will likely have far-reaching implications for the state's IT industry and the well-being of its workforce.","The Karnataka State IT/ITeS Employees Union ( KITU ) has vehemently opposed the bill.

How ChatGPT boss may have been ‘duped’ while buying $27 million house with ‘leaky’ sewage problem,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-chatgpt-boss-may-have-been-duped-while-buying-27-million-house-with-leaky-sewage-problem/articleshow/111830959.cms,",

Inside a $40.5M Estate With a ""Batcave"" Garage | On The Market | Architectural Digest

Sam Altman , CEO of OpenAI , the company behind ChatGPT , may have been duped when he bought his house, a very expensive one, in a posh locality of San Francisco. The $27 million mansion with a ‘batcave' garage he bought has been plagued by serious issues, according a lawsuit.A lawsuit, filed by 950 Lombard LLC against real estate developer Troon Pacific , as reported by the San Francisco Standardclaims the mansion was falsely advertised as “highest quality” despite having “pervasive shoddy workmanship.” Altman is believed to be the current resident of the 9,500-square-foot estate located on San Francisco's iconic Lombard Street.The house has a fancy swimming pool that goes right up to the edge of the house. But this pool has been causing trouble. Last August, it leaked and flooded part of the house. This made the ceiling fall down in some places and caused mould to grow.The lawsuit says it might cost more than $4 million just to fix the pool. But that’s not all - there are other problems too. Some pipes were letting dirty toilet water leak onto the ground outside. Also, many of the pipes that water the garden are leaking.The plaintiff say that Troon Pacific knew about these problems but didn’t tell the truth. The developer is also alleged to have hired unqualified contractors, some of whom reportedly retaliated by stuffing drainage pipes with debris over payment disputes.This isn’t the first time Troon Pacific has been in trouble. Earlier this year, they had to pay back $50 million to people who gave them money for another house project that didn't get finished.The Lombard lawsuit seeks unspecified damages, including interest and legal fees. Neither Altman nor his representatives have publicly commented on the matter.","Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, may have been duped when he bought his house.

How Amazon’s ‘dirty diapers mistake’ killed this multi-million dollar family business,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-amazons-dirty-diapers-mistake-killed-this-multi-million-dollar-family-business/articleshow/111812571.cms,"‘Damaging review’ stayed for years

What Amazon said

A small family business selling washable swim diapers on Amazon was ruined after the e-commerce giant resold a used, faeces-stained diaper to a customer, according to a report from Bloomberg.Paul and Rachelle Baron , owners of Beau & Belle Littles, say their once-thriving company has been devastated by a single one-star review left in 2020. The customer received a diaper ""covered in poop stains"" that Amazon had apparently failed to inspect before reselling as new.The review, which included photos of the soiled diaper, quickly gained traction as other shoppers marked it ""helpful."" This boosted its visibility in the e-commerce platform's algorithm, overshadowing hundreds of positive reviews.""The last four years have been an emotional train wreck,"" Paul Baron told Bloomberg. The couple says they are now $600,000 in debt, barely making enough to pay down loans and order inventory.Amazon's policy requires inspection of all returned items before resale. However, consultants told Bloomberg that selling used products as new is a growing problem on the platform. The sheer volume of returns makes thorough inspection difficult, according to a former Amazon employee.Despite repeated pleas from the Barons, Amazon reportedly refused to remove the damaging review for years. The company finally took it down hours after Bloomberg published its report on Monday.In a statement to Bloomberg, Amazon spokesperson Chris Oster said they have since improved their returns process and updated policies to prevent resale of certain returned products. He called such incidents ""extremely rare.""While Amazon’s marketplace provides small businesses access to millions of customers, the case highlights that sellers have little recourse when things go wrong. Some critics say Amazon's algorithms and review system can amplify isolated incidents, potentially ruining businesses over a single mistake.For the Barons, who once appeared on national television as an Amazon success story, the damage has already been done. They are now seeking additional work to make ends meet.""Amazon talks a big game about helping small businesses,"" Paul Baron said. ""But they really don't.""","Beau & Belle Littles, a small business selling washable swim diapers, was ruined by a single one-star review left in 2020.

Government suspends these two telemarketing companies over sending 5.5 million fraud SMSes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/government-suspends-these-two-telemarketing-companies-over-fraud-smses/articleshow/111823013.cms,"The duo sent over 5mn fraud SMSes since Jan, 2024, DoT claims

What the companies has to say about it?

Amid rising SMS frauds in the country, the department of telecommunications ( DoT ) has suspended operations of two telemarketing companies, namely V-con Intelligent Security and OneXtel Media, reports Economic Times. In its direction dated July 15, the telecom department said that the two misused their platform to send malicious and phishing SMSes, the report states.“In the interest of safeguarding the citizens from cybercrime/financial frauds, all the TSPs (telecom service providers) are directed to: immediately suspend these two RTMs (registered telemarketers )…(and) lodge police complaint against them for misusing DLT platform for sending malicious and phishing SMSes,” read the DoT direction.V-con - a part of the Videocon Group, and OneXtel Media were found responsible for sending 55.5 million fraudulent SMSes to smartphone users since January 2024. DoT’s action comes after receiving several complaints filed by telecom users on the Chakshu portal about malicious SMSes.Quoting officials involved in the investigations, the ET report states that the DoT ordered blacklisting of 131 principal entities (PEs), 5,000 SMS content templates, and 700 SMS headers. However, the fraud senders came up with new headers to cheat the blockchain-based SMS filtering system.The ET report says that it was also found that one among these two entities – V-con and OneXtel – had received money from bank accounts that were involved in multiple complaints of organised transnational crimes, including illegal stock investment frauds.As per the report, OneXtel has strongly opposed the government’s suspension on grounds that the company was not given any opportunity to present its case. Abrar Chunawala, chief executive of OneXtel Media said “We are in cognizance of DoT’s order but also surprised on how the government has casted the burden on a reputed telemarketer like us operating since nine years. It must be noted that we were never intimated about the department’s action, no show-cause notice was served.”“The 55.5 million ballpark figure given in the order, presumably is for 6 months and belongs to two entities. Let’s assume 17 million of these were passed through Onextel. This represents only 0.06% of our total traffic. Is it then fair to suddenly put a company out of business for such a small percentage? As per regulation, it is the responsibility of telecom companies to operate the DLT system. Are they not at fault along with their DLT tech partners?” Chunawala added.",V-con Intelligent Security and OneXtel Media were found responsible for sending 55.5 million fraudulent SMSes to smartphone users since January 2024.

Ashneer Grover , founder of BharatPe and ex-Shark Tank judge recently sat for a podcast interview with YouTuber Ishan Sharma. During the interview, Grover shared his thoughts about the hiring process stating that he does not believe in lengthy hiring process and notice periods. He said that he believes in ‘ hire fast, fire fast ’ rule.When asked about how he hires and manages people, Grover said that he has personally not experienced 100% success in hiring the right candidate.“What I have basically understood about hiring, and a lot of people don’t agree with this thought, it’s hire fast, fire fast,” he said in the podcast.Explaining further, he added “What’s happening currently is that you are investing a lot of time in hiring a person, you go through multiple rounds. The candidate is also, naturally, at his best behaviour. When a candidate comes to sell himself or pitch for himself, then the salesman in him is at its peak. At the end of the day, you will get to know whether he will work or not only after you give him his tasks,”.“Sometimes people are able to sell themselves very well. My realisation is this – we spend 3 months identifying the ideal candidate, then the candidate serves his 2 months of notice period, so we wait for those 2 months. We, at this point, have already invested around 6 months into this role. Once the candidate joins, we want to give him the same amount of time to prove himself. So from 6 months, now it is 1 year.”“After a year, you realise he is not a good fit.
