Facebook-parent Meta releases “the most advanced open source” AI model yet,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/facebook-parent-meta-releases-the-most-advanced-open-source-ai-model-yet/articleshow/111969392.cms,"How Llama 3.1 is different from Llama 3

Meta is working with Amazon and Nvidia for developer access

Facebook 's parent company Meta has released the latest iteration of its AI model called Llama 3.1. What makes this announcement significant is that this new model is “by far the most advanced open source model” available, and is the largest one developed by Meta to date. The launch of Llama 3.1 comes as Meta looks to position itself as a major player alongside tech giants like Google , Amazon , and startups such as OpenAI and Anthropic.Company CEO Mark Zuckerberg made the announcement in a video on Instagram.“We have got another big AI release today,” Zuckerberg said in the video. He said that “Meta is on track to becoming the most used AI assistant in the world by the end of the year”, adding that there are hundreds of millions of people using it everyday. The tech CEO also said that the AI model will be available in more countries soon.Zuckerberg added that Llama 3.1 will support more languages, offer more reasoning and is “just better overall” as compared to the predecessor. He noted that the company is adding a feature that can generate images in which ‘users can put themselves in’.As per the company, the new model is being released with three training parameters: Llama 3.1 with 405 billion parameters, the first frontier-level open source AI model, as well as improved Llama 3.1 70 billion and 8 billion models.“In addition to having significantly better cost/performance relative to closed models, the fact that the 405B model is open will make it the best choice for fine-tuning and distilling smaller models,” the company said. Zucekrberg also noted that Meta will also release a tool that will allow customers their own AI models.Similar to Meta’s release of Llama 2, the company is partnering with other tech companies that will offer their customers access to Llama 3.1 via their respective cloud computing platforms.“Beyond releasing these models, we’re working with a range of companies to grow the broader ecosystem. Amazon, Databricks, and Nvidia are launching full suites of services to support developers fine-tuning and distilling their own models,” Meta added.Llama 3.1’s largest version (with 405 billion parameters) has been trained with over 16,000 of Nvidia’s H100 GPUs.","Llama 3.1 is ‘by far the most advanced open source model’ available, says Meta.

Why this Israeli startup said no to Google's '$23 billion acquisition offer',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-this-israeli-startup-said-no-to-googles-23-billion-acquisition-offer/articleshow/111969643.cms,"Why Wiz decided to call off the ‘Google deal’



“I know the last week has been intense, with the buzz about a potential acquisition. While we are flattered by the offers we have received, we have chosen to continue on our path to building Wiz. Saying no to such humbling offers is tough, but with our exceptional team, I feel confident in making that choice. The market validation we have experienced following this news only reinforces our goal – creating a platform that both security and development teams love.”

Google-parent Alphabet ’s plans to acquire cybersecurity startup Wiz have reportedly fallen through. The Israeli company is said to have said no to the acquisition, which the media reports pegged at $23 billion. Had the deal proceeded, it would have been Google ’s largest-ever acquisition to date. In a memo to its employees, Wiz CEO Assaf Rappaport wrote why the company didn't go ahead with the deal.In the memo seen by The Guardian, Rappaport wrote:Rappaport also said that Wiz will focus on its next milestones -- an initial public offering and $1 billion in annual recurring revenue. The company had been reportedly eyeing both targets well before talks with Google had been reported.Meanwhile, another person familiar with Wiz’s decision (who requested anonymity) reportedly told CNBC that the company considered anti-trust and investor concerns as the reasons for abandoning the potential deal with Google.","Google's plans to acquire cybersecurity startup Wiz have reportedly fallen through.

How Apple plans to cut down on its Hollywood spending,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-apple-plans-to-cut-down-on-its-hollywood-spending/articleshow/111965622.cms,"Expensive projects aren’t attracting viewers

No layoffs at TV division so far

Apple is going easy on spending money on making TV shows and movies after losing billions of dollars over the past few years. The company has spent more than $20 billion on shows that not many people watch. Eddy Cue , who runs Apple's services, as per Bloomberg, is now meeting often with the heads of Apple's TV studio, Zack Van Amburg and Jamie Erlicht .They are talking about how to spend less money on new shows and movies.Bloomberg reports that Apple TV+ only gets 0.2% of TV viewing in the United States. This means that in one month, Apple TV+ gets fewer viewers than Netflix gets in just one day, which is said to have a 8% of share in TV viewing.Apple has been known for spending a lot of money on single projects. For example, they spent over $500 million on movies from famous directors like Martin Scorsese and Ridley Scott . They also spent more than $250 million on a World War II show called ""Masters of the Air."" But these expensive projects didn't attract many viewers.To save money, Apple is now trying to pay less money upfront for new shows, stopping shows that aren't popular more quickly, making other studios pay more when shows go over budget, and buying some shows from other companies instead of making everything themselves. Apple is also being more careful with money on popular shows like ""Severance"" and ""Foundation."" They want these shows to cost less to make.Even though Apple is spending less, they haven't fired many people like other TV companies have. This is because Apple makes most of its money from selling iPhones and other devices, not from TV shows. Apple TV+ has won awards and good reviews from critics. But it hasn't gotten as many viewers as Apple hoped. Now, they want to make their TV business more successful without spending as much money.It's not clear yet how these changes will affect the quality of Apple's shows in the future. The company is trying to find a balance between making good shows and spending less money. Apple doesn't share much information about how much money it spends or makes from its TV business. This makes it hard for people outside the company to know exactly how well Apple TV+ is doing.","Apple has been known for spending a lot of money on single projects.

""The Union

Budget 2024

presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is a visionary step towards inclusive growth, with a strong emphasis on manufacturing, upskilling, and women empowerment. Youth and participation of women in the workforce hold the key to India’s success. To this end, the focus on extensive training and skill development initiatives demonstrates a clear commitment to boosting employability and productivity. By linking job creation in manufacturing to first-time workers and offering EPFO incentives, the government is paving the way for a robust manufacturing ecosystem, creating 4 crore jobs over the next five years. It is certainly a commendable initiative to boost local manufacturing. Additionally, offering internship opportunities in the top 500 companies to 1 crore youth is a strategic move that will equip our young population with the skills and experience necessary to thrive in a competitive global economy.

The establishment of e-commerce export hubs in a PPP model is another significant step taken by the government and will significantly empower MSMEs and traditional artisans to compete internationally. It will open opportunities for Indian players to boost their reach globally while enhancing the ease of doing business and accessing new markets. India has long been an attractive consumer market for international brands, supported by our collaborative and business-friendly policies that enable seamless operations. The export hubs are an efficient step in unlocking similar avenues for homegrown companies, allowing a global stage for their innovation and entrepreneurial mindset, and strengthening India’s position in manufacturing.

Lastly, I feel the abolition of the angel tax will undoubtedly boost funding in the startup ecosystem, fueling innovation and growth. This move, along with incentives for job creation in the manufacturing sector and support for MSMEs, will not only stimulate valuable employment opportunities for millions of young people but also ensure economic resilience, laying a strong foundation for a powerful growth trajectory for India. Driven by the vision of Viksit Bharat, we look forward to actively participating in the nation's journey towards global prominence and innovation leadership.""

Varun Gupta, Co-Founder, Boult

""We’re thrilled about the Finance Minister’s recent announcement to simplify FDI rules and make things easier for investors. This is a big win for the Indian startup scene and will definitely bring in more investment, drive innovation, and boost growth.

The removal of the angel tax is great news for early-stage startups and shows the government's support for startup funding. The focus on creating jobs, developing skills, supporting MSMEs, and boosting manufacturing is setting the stage for a better India.

The new Credit Guarantee Scheme for MSMEs, along with the push for skill development and easier FDI regulations, is a solid approach to promoting growth and making us more competitive globally. Plus, the government’s focus on upskilling the youth and embracing advanced manufacturing and digital tech is giving us a competitive edge.

And the drop in customs duty on PCBs for mobile phones is a game-changer for the electronics industry. Lowering the duty from 20% to 15% will make electronics more competitive and also boost growth for the wearables market.""

Ashok Rajpal, Managing Director, Ambrane India

""In her Budget speech on July 23, 2024, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman proposed reducing the basic customs duty on mobile phones and chargers from 20 per cent to 15 per cent. This move is expected to boost exports and enhance global competitiveness while also increasing domestic adoption by lowering costs. The finance minister emphasized the maturity of the Indian mobile phone industry and highlighted a strong focus on manufacturing, R&D, and innovation, particularly within the MSME sector. These measures are poised to drive substantial growth in the consumer electronics and mobile accessories industries, positioning India as a leading manufacturing hub.""

Bodhisattwa Sanghapriya, Founder and CEO, IG Drones

""We applaud the Union Budget's focus on innovation, R&D, and next-generation reforms, aligning with the Government's nine key priorities. This emphasis will accelerate the growth of the drone sector and enhance advanced technologies like AI and IoT. The budget fosters an environment supporting technological advancements and cutting-edge research, paving the way for significant progress in the drone industry. The FM's announcement of a fivefold expansion of the space economy and a Rs. 1,000 crore boost for the space sector further underscores this commitment.

Additionally, the abolition of the angel tax for all tax classes is excellent news for startups, aiding in capital formation in the country. We are excited about the opportunities this budget presents and remain dedicated to leveraging these advancements to drive innovation and bolster the nation's technological leadership on a global scale. Notably, under the Namo Drone Didi Scheme recently, the Government has allocated Rs. 1,261 crore to provide drones to 15,000 Women Self Help Groups (SHGs) for rental services to farmers, covering 80% of the costs up to Rs 8 lakh.""

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman presented Union Budget 2024 in the parliament today (July 23). This is Modi 3.0 government's first Budget post general elections 2024. The focus of FM Sitharaman's Budget is said to be on employment generation, inflation management, and fiscal prudence. Industry has widely welcomed the Budget 2024.

Why this country seized $131 million from Amazon's logistic services unit,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-this-country-seized-131-million-from-amazons-logistic-services-unit/articleshow/111964401.cms,"What Italy’s tax police have alleged



Amazon’s French unit also faced a $35 million fine



A unit of Amazon in Italy was reportedly forced to pay nearly 121 million euros to the country’s tax police. According to a report by the news agency Reuters, prosecutors' documents show that this amount was seized from the Italian unit of the e-commerce major as part of an investigation into alleged tax fraud and illegal labour practices.In a 94-page order seen by Reuters, the Milan Prosecutors' Office alleged that the company’s logistic services unit, Amazon Italia Transport , has evaded labour and tax laws of the country.The officials also accused the unit of relying on cooperatives or limited liability companies that supplied workers while omitting VAT tax duties and reducing social security payments.Prosecutors claimed that this system allowed the Amazon unit to maintain competitive prices for its services in the Italian market.Apart from Amazon, Italian officials have also conducted similar investigations that have targeted other large companies in recent years. This includes global delivery giants DHL and UPS , German logistics firm DB Schenker, and Italian supermarket chain Esselunga.Earlier, in January, Amazon's French operations faced a $35 million fine levied by the French Data Protection Authority , the Commission Nationale de l’Informatique et des Libertés (CNIL). The tech giant was accused of employing an intrusive system to monitor its warehouse workers' performance and activity.CNIL had issues with Amazon's use of handheld barcode scanners at its warehouses. While these devices are commonly used in warehouse management, the French regulator argued that the e-commerce company’s implementation went beyond industry standards.The French watchdog claimed that by tracking employees down to the second and measuring periods of inactivity, the company was effectively subjecting workers to constant surveillance and pressure.The CNIL's investigation revealed that the system was so precise it could detect errors if items were scanned too quickly, creating a high-pressure environment for employees.Moreover, Amazon's retention of detailed employee data for an extended period was deemed unnecessary and also violated the EU’s data protection regulations.","Prosecutors' documents show that this amount was seized from the Italian unit of the e-commerce major.

Fake gas disconnection notices ‘scamming’ IGL customers: How to spot one,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/fake-gas-disconnection-notices-scamming-igl-customers-how-to-spot-one/articleshow/111963653.cms,"How IGL scam works

Notification. Dear customer your igi gas connection will be disconnected. Tonight at 10:30pm from igl office because your previous month bill was not update please immediately contact with our igl office 7365990141 thank you.

IGL has an advisory related to the scam

Attention IGL PNG Customers! 🚨

Be alert for fraudulent calls and messages claiming to be from Indraprastha Gas Limited. These scams often request you to download an app or click on links for bill payments, sometimes threatening service disconnection

How to safeguard against IGL scam

Fraudsters are reusing an old scam tactic , this time targeting customers of piped natural gas (PNG). After a recent spate of fake electricity bill notices , scammers have shifted their focus to gas connections. Indraprastha Gas Limited (IGL) has issued a warning to customers about the new scam.Just like in the case of power cut frauds, scammers are sending text messages or calling consumers, claiming their gas connection will be disconnected if they don’t immediately pay an outstanding bill.Notably, these messages often include a fake customer care number , and once a customer calls the number, they are pressured into making an online payment.Here’s one of the notifications that one member of The Times of India team received recently. It is to be noted that the team member received such messages on multiple days.Sometimes, customers also receive phone calls from a ‘fake’ IGL representative who threatens the user of an action, which is disconnection, if the bill is not paid immediately. The customer, unaware of the scam, panics and agrees to pay the bill, eventually falling victim to the scam.IGL recently advised consumers to be wary of such messages and calls. The company said that customers should only make payments through official IGL channels and verify any suspicious activity with the company directly.The first thing to keep in mind is to stay calm upon receiving such communication. If you have already paid the bill, you must ignore such calls and messages.Look for spelling mistakes in the message as they have poorly written English with grammatical and punctuation mistakes. Any official message will have a set format for communication.Even if you are tempted, do not call the number given in the message. If a payment has to be made, do by visiting the official IGL website.When you visit the official website, a pop-up message shows “FRAUD ALERT Notice to IGL PNG customers”.IGL also notes that in these frauds, scammers also request customers to download an app or click on links for bill payments, often threatening disconnection. “Never click on these links or download any apps,” it adds.","Fraudsters are reusing an old scam tactic, this time targeting customers of piped natural gas (PNG) After a recent spate of fake electricity bill notices, scammers have shifted their focus to gas connections.

Nirmala Sitharaman , Union Finance Minister, has begun presenting the Union Budget for the fiscal year 2024-2025 in the Lok Sabha hall of Parliament in New Delhi. This marks her seventh consecutive budget speech since 2019 and her second for this year, 2024. Earlier, on February 1, 2024, she presented an interim budget ahead of the general elections.The budget announcement will be scrutinised by various sectors, including industry, taxation, and the middle-income class.This budget is particularly significant as it is the first annual financial statement of the Modi government's third term in power.

Karnataka reservation bill: PhonePe CEO and founder Sameer Nigam issues this 'personal statement',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/karnataka-reservation-bill-phonepe-ceo-and-founder-sameer-nigam-issues-this-personal-statement/articleshow/111908948.cms,"Read PhonePe CEO Sameer Nigam’s personal note

“PhonePe was born in Bengaluru and we are incredibly proud of our roots in this city, which is well known for its world-class technology talent and vibrant diversity. From Bengaluru, over the past decade we have expanded across the length and breadth of India and been able to deliver secure and efficient digital payments for over 55 Crore Indians.

Bengaluru's reputation as the ""Silicon valley of India"" is truly well-deserved. The city thrives on an incredible culture of innovation, and attracts the most brilliant young minds from Karnataka and the rest of India. As a company, we are deeply grateful for the supportive business environment that Karnataka’s governments and its local

Kannadiga

populace have offered us. Without such an inclusive ecosystem and progressive policies, Bengaluru would not have become a global technology superpower.

As a company we also thrive on celebrating diversity, we have always tried hard to deliver fair, unbiased and meritocracy-based employment opportunities for all Indians - including to all local Kannadigas. We believe such an approach gives every Indian a good job a chance to shine, and ultimately helps create more societal and economic value for Bengaluru, Karnataka and India.

I read some recent media articles, relating to a few personal comments that I made last week regarding the draft job reservation bill. I would first and foremost like to clarify that it was NEVER my intention to insult Karnataka and it’s people. If my comments hurt anyone’s sentiments in such a way, I am truly sorry and would like to offer you an unconditional apology. I have the highest regard for Kannada, and all other Indian languages. In fact, I truly believe that linguistic diversity and rich cultural heritage is a national asset that all Indians should be proud of; and all Indians should be respectful of and celebrate local and cultural norms.

Bengaluru’s Indian startups are competing against trillion dollar giants like Google, Apple, Amazon and Microsoft. To do so, these companies must be able to employ the very best talent available in India purely based on their technology skills and proficiency in fields such as Coding, Design, Product Management, Data Sciences, Machine Learning, AI and beyond. As a nation, that is the only way we can build world-class companies that can compete in the global village that we live in today.

I also want to help create lakhs of jobs for Bengaluru and Karnataka. And, I believe with more dialogue and discussion, we can find ways to create more sustainable employment avenues. Let’s all work together to do this meaningfully and while creating long-term impact.”

PhonePe CEO Sameer Nigam issued a personal note following backlash over his comments on Karnataka 's job reservation bill. The controversy erupted after Nigam criticised the bill on social media platform X, questioning whether his children deserved jobs in their home city given his company's pan-India job creation.""If my comments hurt anyone's sentiments, I am truly sorry and would like to offer you an unconditional apology,"" Nigam said in a statement.He emphasised his 22-year connection to Bengaluru and respect for linguistic diversity.The Karnataka Cabinet had recently approved a bill mandating 50% reservation for locals in management roles and 70% in non-management positions within private companies. The bill, which also proposed 100% quota for locals in certain government jobs, was put on hold after industry backlash.Nigam stressed the need for merit-based hiring to build globally competitive companies.
