Some LinkedIn users were ‘unhappy’ with the AI prompts



LinkedIn has reportedly removed its AI-powered prompts. These prompts were part of a suite of AI-powered enhancements that the Microsoft-owned professional networking platform announced in November of last year. It included questions that had been appearing under almost every post for LinkedIn Premium users for the last several months. While announcing the company promised that these tools will use gen AI to “meticulously analyse the content within your feed and across job postings, bringing to light pivotal opportunities.”In an emailed statement to Fast Company, LinkedIn spokesperson Suzi Owens said:to help our members grow in their careers, gathering feedback to improve and invest where it matters most.We’ve removed the insights on feed posts, as we continue to test and learn, but members can still use our AI-powered tools on the jobs home page to get personalised insights, like how to build a network, position yourself for a job, or learn about a company.”While prompt questions may be disappearing from general posts, LinkedIn may not be abandoning AI entirely. These prompts can be a key component of the job search experience, and the platform promises to further integrate AI features in the coming days, potentially enhancing user interactions in new and innovative ways.The company also LinkedIn recently modified its user agreement which will automatically enroll users into a program where their data can be used to train the platform's AI algorithms.According to the report, some users complained that there was no apparent way to disable the prompts. LinkedIn had promised that the feature would “take on the hard work of parsing through long articles, videos and posts.” However, clicking the prompts often produced simple AI-generated summaries of the original content.These LinkedIn Premium subscribers reportedly felt they were paying extra for a feature that was more of an annoyance than a benefit as it took up valuable space in their feeds without providing much value in return.",LinkedIn has reportedly removed its AI-powered prompts from general posts.

“Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao, the founder and former CEO of Binance, has been released from a U.S. federal prison on September 27, after serving a four-month sentence for violating

anti-money laundering

(AML) regulations. According to the U.S. Federal Bureau of Prisons, CZ had pled guilty to charges of failing to implement proper AML controls at Binance, the world’s largest

crypto exchange

by daily trading volume. He also stepped down as CEO.

Initially, the U.S.

Department of Justice

(DOJ) sought a 36-month sentence, but the court reduced it to four months after determining that CZ wasn’t directly aware of illegal activities at Binance. He also agreed to pay a $50 million fine, while Binance itself was hit with $4.3 billion in penalties for AML violations.

CZ spent two months in a minimum-security prison in California before being moved to a halfway house in Long Beach, where he was allowed supervised daytime outings. While CZ no longer runs Binance, the company continues to thrive under new leadership, surpassing 230 million users worldwide.

With an estimated net worth of $60 billion, CZ is the richest person to serve time in a U.S. prison. His personal wealth remains largely unaffected, and he still holds a 90% stake in Binance. The crypto community is now eager to see what CZ’s next move will be after his release. Binance, meanwhile, continues to dominate the global cryptocurrency landscape.”

What US alleged against Binance and Zhao



Binance founder Changpeng Zhao has been released from US jail . Zhao was released after serving a four-month sentence at a low-security correctional facility in California. Earlier this year, the Binance founder was sentenced after a US investigation discovered that the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange had failed to stop widespread criminal activity. Zhao pleaded guilty to charges brought by the US Department of Justice and paid a criminal fine of $50 million as well as a $50 million penalty to the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission along with relinquishing his executive role at Binance.The company also faced an even steeper penalty, settling with the US government for a staggering $4.3 billion, marking one of the largest corporate fines in the country’s history.In its Binance Square blog post, the company wrote:US prosecutors accused Binance of promoting a business model that attracted criminals and facilitated illegal activities. They alleged that Binance failed to report over 100,000 suspicious transactions linked to designated terrorist organisations and that the exchange even supported the sale of child sexual abuse material. Additionally, they alleged that Binance profited from ransomware attacks by receiving a significant portion of the proceeds.However, he is still the 25th richest person in the world with a net worth of $61 billion and retains nearly 90% stake in Binance, reports Forbes.","Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao, the founder and former CEO of Binance, has been released from a U.S. federal prison on September 27.

Dell ends work from home for global sales team: Read what the company said in a mail sent to employees,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/dell-ends-work-from-home-for-global-sales-team-what-the-memo-said/articleshow/113770700.cms,"Here’s the full text of the memo sent by Dell to its employees

Hi Team,

This sales force has a culture of winning and a reputation of outpacing the competition. We are the best in the business! That doesn't come without dedicated focus, perseverance and grit. To uphold this legacy, we must continuously work at it. To grow faster than the market and take share, we must always be sharpening our edge.

The Sales floor is a unique environment that combines high energy with a culture of collaboration and continuous improvement. To harness this energy and grow skills, we believe our sales teams need to be together in the office. Additionally, our data shows that sales teams are more productive when onsite.

With that in mind, starting Monday, Sept. 30, the expectation is that ALL Global Sales team members who can work from a Dell office be onsite five days a week, regardless of role. Field sellers are expected to spend five days a week with customers and partners or in a

Dell Technologies

office. Field sellers who can't go into a Dell office should prioritize time spent in person with customers and partners. Remote sales team members who can't go into a Dell office should continue to work remotely. More communications pertaining to remote workers will be sent in the coming weeks.

Yes, this is a shift from current expectations. The industry and technology are moving fast, the opportunity is enormous and we need to ensure we are best positioned to seize it. We know situations will arise when you need to work remotely. This is expected, but working remotely should be the exception rather than routine. We also know many of you have organized your lives around three days in the office and you may need some time to make new arrangements.

Global Facilities will continue to assess neighborhood capacity and will address any future needs.

When we're not traveling to meet with customers and partners, we are in the office. When you step onto the Sales floor with all team members onsite, the energy is amazing - it's dynamic and fast- paced. Sales managers are actively engaged on the floor, not from a distance, providing real-time feedback, guidance and support.

Our strength lies in a culture of collaborating, winning and celebrating together. As we enter a new Al world, in-person human interaction will be more important than ever.

Let's go win, outpace the competition, seize every opportunity and take share!

Picture abhi baaki hai (The story isn't over yet)

Today, I celebrate 2 years of being in IndiGo (

InterGlobe Aviation

Ltd) and India. On our 18th IndiGo birthday last month, we celebrated many wonderful milestones and unveiled our ambitious plans for coming years. Our story has just started. I am grateful and proud to be a part of this incredible IndiGo journey with my colleagues - giving wings to the nation with over 2,000 daily flights, 430+ domestic and 100+ international routes, and growing every day.

When I had joined, I had shared the quote, ""Wherever you go, becomes a part of you somehow”. Being a part of IndiGo and now living now in India for two years....IndiGo and this beautiful country India have indeed become a part of me. Bharat ab ghar jaisa lagta hai.

India's essence is captured in its beautiful diversity. Of our 88 domestic cities, I had the pleasure of visiting our great teams in 30. From Thiruvananthapuram in the south to Leh in the north. My most recent visit was to Leh, where walking with my son at 18,000 feet at the Khardung La Pass was very special considering my roots are from a country where the highest ""hill"" is some 300 metres only and around 25% of the land is below sea level 😊

Here are some pictures from my travels in the last two years. Can you guess the cities?

Hi all,

I have something to share with you. After much reflection, I have made the difficult decision to leave OpenAl. My six-and-a-half years with the OpenAl team have been an extraordinary privilege. While I'll express my gratitude to many individuals in the coming days, I want to start by thanking Sam and Greg for their trust in me to lead the technical organization and for their support throughout the years. There's never an ideal time to step away from a place one cherishes, yet this moment feels right. Our recent releases of speech-to-speech and OpenAl 01 mark the beginning of a new era in interaction and intelligence - achievements made possible by your ingenuity and craftsmanship. We didn't merely build smarter models, we fundamentally changed how Al systems learn and reason through complex problems. We brought safety research from the theoretical realm into practical applications, creating models that are more robust, aligned, and steerable than ever before. Our work has made cutting-edge Al research intuitive and accessible, developing technology that adapts and evolves based on everyone's input. This success is a testament to our outstanding teamwork, and it is because of your brilliance, your dedication, and your commitment that OpenAl stands at the pinnacle of AI innovation. I'm stepping away because I want to create the time and space to do my own exploration. For now, my primary focus is doing everything in my power to ensure a smooth transition, maintaining the momentum we've built.

I will forever be grateful for the opportunity to build and work alongside this remarkable team. Together, we've pushed the boundaries of scientific understanding in our quest to improve human well-being. While I may no longer be in the trenches with you, I will still be rooting for you all. With deep gratitude for the friendships forged, the triumphs achieved, and most importantly, the challenges overcome together.

Mira



What OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said

Hi All

Mira has been instrumental to OpenAI’s progress and growth the last 6.5 years; she has been a hugely significant factor in our development from an unknown research lab to an important company.

When Mira informed me this morning that she was leaving, I was saddened but of course support her decision. For the past year, she has been building out a strong bench of leaders that will continue our progress.

I also want to share that Bob and Barret have decided to depart OpenAI. Mira, Bob, and Barret made these decisions independently of each other and amicably, but the timing of Mira’s decision was such that it made sense to now do this all at once, so that we can work together for a smooth handover to the next generation of leadership.

I am extremely grateful to all of them for their contributions.

Being a leader at OpenAI is all-consuming. On one hand it’s a privilege to build AGI and be the fastest-growing company that gets to put our advanced research in the hands of hundreds of millions of people. On the other hand it’s relentless to lead a team through it—and they have gone above and beyond the call of duty for the company.

Mark is going to be our new SVP of Research and will now lead the research org in partnership with Jakub as Chief Scientist. This has been our long-term succession plan for Bob someday; although it’s happening sooner than we thought, I couldn’t be more excited that Mark is stepping into the role. Mark obviously has deep technical expertise, but he has also learned how to be a leader and manager in a very impressive way over the past few years.

Josh Achiam is going to take on a new role as Head of Mission Alignment, working across the company to ensure that we get all pieces (and culture) right to be in a place to succeed at the mission.

Kevin and Srinivas will continue to lead the Applied team.

Matt Knight will be our Chief Information Security Officer having already served in this capacity for a long time. This has been our plan for quite some time.

Mark, Jakub, Kevin, Srinivas, Matt, and Josh will report to me. I have over the past year or so spent most of my time on the non-technical parts of our organization; I am now looking forward to spending most of my time on the technical and product parts of the company.

...

Leadership changes are a natural part of companies, especially companies that grow so quickly and are so demanding. I obviously won’t pretend it’s natural for this one to be so abrupt, but we are not a normal company, and I think the reasons Mira explained to me (there is never a good time, anything not abrupt would have leaked, and she wanted to do this while OpenAI was in an upswing) make sense. We can both talk about this more tomorrow during all-hands.

Thank you for all of your hard work and dedication.

Sam

Trump accused Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg of sabotaging 2020 election

Former US President Donald Trump has said that if he wins the upcoming US elections, he plans to seek the prosecution of Google . Trump, who is running as the Republican presidential candidate, accused the tech giant of displaying only “bad stories” about him.According to a report by news agency Reuters, Trump shared this in a post on Truth Social – his own microblogging platform – but did not provide any evidence to support his claim about Google.Trump accused Google of having an illegal system.“It has been determined that Google has illegally used a system of only revealing and displaying bad stories about Donald J. Trump, some made up for this purpose while, at the same time, only revealing good stories about Comrade Kamala Harris,” he said.“This is an ILLEGAL ACTIVITY, and hopefully the Justice Department will criminally prosecute them for this blatant Interference of Elections. If not, and subject to the Laws of our Country, I will request their prosecution, at the maximum levels, when I win the Election, and become President of the United States!” he added.Trump previously made similar accusations against Google in 2019, Reuters said, citing the Washington Post. He claimed in a series of Twitter posts that Google had biassed its search results to promote negative stories about him during the 2016 election. Google dismissed the allegations at the time.This is not the first time that Trump has spoken against a tech company. In August this, Trump accused Meta chief Mark Zuckerberg of sabotaging him during the 2020 election.Trump wrote that Zuckerberg “would come to the Oval Office to see me.He would bring his very nice wife to dinners, be as nice as anyone could be, while always plotting to install shameful Lock Boxes in a true plot against the President,” Trump said while referring to a $420 million contribution Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, made during the 2020 election to fund election infrastructure.“He told me there was nobody like Trump on Facebook. But at the same time, and for whatever reason, steered it against me,” Trump said.He also warned the Meta chief executive that if he again tried to do any illegal things then he would “spend the rest of his life in prison.”","Former US President Donald Trump has said that if he wins the upcoming US elections, he plans to seek the prosecution of Google.

What is AI Pact

What is this AI Pact all about

Over 100 tech companies, including Indian majors Tata Consultancy Service ( TCS ), Infosys and Wipro along with giants like Google Microsoft and Amazon have pledged their early compliance with the European Union’s (EU) AI rules, which came into law on August 1, through an AI Pact .The AI Pact essentially encourages and supports organisations to plan ahead for the implementation of AI Act measures.While some provisions of the AI Act are already fully applicable, it is to be noted that some rules for “high risk” systems will be enforced in the region in August 2027 – at the end of a transitional period (that is, the time between entry into force and date of applicability).The European Commission is promoting the AI Pact for which it called for interest by companies in November 2023, obtaining responses from over 550 organisations of various sizes, sectors, and countries.The European Commission recently gathered major industry players in Brussels to celebrate the first signatories of the EU AI Pact, a voluntary set of pledges aimed at promoting responsible AI development.Over 100 companies, including multinational corporations and European SMEs, have already signed on, representing diverse sectors like IT, healthcare, and finance. The AI Pact encourages these companies to take proactive steps towards compliance with the upcoming EU AI Act.These steps include implementing AI governance strategies, identifying high-risk AI systems, and promoting AI awareness among staff. Companies are also urged to tailor further commitments to their specific activities, such as ensuring human oversight of AI systems, mitigating potential risks, and transparently labelling AI-generated content like deepfakes.Facebook-parent Meta and Apple are not on the list of companies that have signed the AI Pact. ChatGPT-maker OpenAI has signed the pledge, despite its announcement last year saying it may ‘cease operating’ in the EU if it can’t comply with future regulation.","The European Commission recently gathered major industry players in Brussels to celebrate the first signatories of the EU AI Pact.

Brazil's Supreme Court has ruled that X , formerly known as Twitter , must pay over $5 million in outstanding fines before it can resume its services in the country. This includes a new fine imposed by the top court.According to a report by news agency Reuters, earlier this week, the Elon Musk-owned company informed the court that it had complied with orders to curb misinformation and requested the ban on its platform be lifted.In response to X’s reply, Judge Alexandre de Moraes responded on Friday (September 27) with a ruling that X and its legal representative in Brazil must still agree to pay a total of 18.3 million reais ($3.4 million) in pending fines that were previously ordered by the court.Moraes clarified that the court could utilise funds already frozen from X and Starlink accounts in Brazil, but this would require Starlink, also owned by Musk, to withdraw its appeal against the asset freeze.Furthermore, the judge levied an additional 10 million reais ($1.8 million) fine on X for a brief period last week when the platform became accessible to some users in Brazil, despite the ban.While X has yet to respond to a request for comment, a source close to the company told the news agency that they will likely pay all the fines but may challenge the extra 10 million reais fine.X's suspension in Brazil, which is one of its key markets, stems from late August when Moraes ruled that the platform had failed to comply with orders related to hate speech and the appointment of a local legal representative.Musk initially criticised these orders but later reversed his stance, and appointed a local representative.",X must pay over $5 million in outstanding fines before it can resume its services in the country.

In her most recent role, she was also Zomato's chief people officer.The Lady Shri Ram College graduate — also a qualified chartered accountant — is reported to have played an important role in building Zomato’s in-house legal, governance, risk and compliance teams.

Intel breaks silence on sale offers: Here's what company told 'chip company' ARM,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/intel-tells-arm-its-chip-business-not-for-sale/articleshow/113756633.cms,"FILE PHOTO: FILE PHOTO: llustration taken January 8, 2024. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/File Photo/File Photo

Arm , the chip design powerhouse, recently approached Intel about potentially acquiring its product division , but was told the business is not for sale, according to a Bloomberg report citing a person with direct knowledge of the matter.The high-level inquiry from Arm specifically targeted Intel's product group, which sells chips for personal computers , servers, and networking equipment.Notably, Arm did not express interest in Intel's manufacturing operations, the source told Bloomberg.This comes as Intel is facing severe challenges after a disastrous earnings report sparked a historic stock plummet. The company has responded with drastic measures, including massive job cuts, dividend suspension, and restructuring its operations. Intel is separating its product and manufacturing divisions, spinning off its foundry business, and pausing major expansion projects.Arm, majority-owned by SoftBank Group Corp., has been expanding beyond its stronghold in smartphone chip designs under CEO Rene Haas . The company has been pushing into markets traditionally dominated by Intel, such as personal computers and servers.Despite Intel's recent challenges, it remains a significant player in these sectors. A combination with Intel's product division could have significantly boosted Arm's reach and accelerated its move towards selling more of its own products, rather than just licensing designs.Bloomberg reports that Intel's separation of its chip product division from manufacturing operations, while aimed at attracting outside customers and investors, also sets the stage for a potential company split.The news of Arm's interest in Intel comes on the heels of reports that Qualcomm, another major player in the semiconductor industry, has also been exploring acquisition possibilities. The Wall Street Journal recently reported that Qualcomm had approached Intel about a potential takeover, with CEO Cristiano Amon personally involved in negotiations.","Arm, majority-owned by SoftBank Group Corp., has been expanding beyond its stronghold in smartphone chip designs.

Zerodha ’s CTO, Kailash Nadh , has abandoned Google and other search engines for technical queries. Instead, he relies on Claude or GPT-4 for technical debugging. In an interview with MoneyControl, Nadh expressed his belief that the concept of web search as a means of finding answers is becoming outdated, particularly for technical individuals.“However, new engineers should not depend on GPT to generate code without understanding it.In the short term, it'll work because these things do produce great code but I don't think it’ll automatically make them good engineers without learning the fundamentals,” he further added.He said that generating code is just one aspect of designing a piece of technology. The other aspect, he noted, is understanding the essence of why something is being built. “You have to understand consumer expectations. You have to take bets. You have to factor in business considerations. You have to factor in human psychology.”The CTO further stated “In the very long run — decades or centuries — perhaps these things won't matter anymore as software and technology mature as disciplines but in the medium term, they will absolutely matter.”When asked about his statement that the team's mental health has improved after coming back to the office, Nadh said “the gist of it is that Zerodha's history, culture, and way of working is built on well-balanced interpersonal relationships within teams that fuel collaboration.”“We have always hired people for these traits, and not traits that are essential for remote work to be successful such as effective async remote communication and articulation skills,” he noted, adding “During our remote work years, this fundamental incompatibility took a big toll on the team's mental health and productivity, including mine.”He added “Last year, about over 80 percent of the team reported their mental health to be in a poor state. After we started coming back to the office, this year, about more than 90 percent of the team reported that their mental health is in a positive place; mine included.”","Zerodha’s CTO, Kailash Nadh, has abandoned Google and other search engines for technical queries.

How this hotel is different from the conventional ones

""Most hotels are contained within four walls and a lot of times you are building the same unit over and over and over again. I've never been able to build with such little constraint and such fluidity ... just the curves, and the domes, and the parabolas. It's a crazy way to build.""

A colossal 3D printer, the size of a crane, is currently constructing the world’s first 3D-printed hotel in Texas, USA. A report by the news agency Reuters reveals that El Cosmico , a hotel and campground situated near Marfa, Texas, is undergoing an extraordinary expansion. Instead of the conventional method of construction, this massive 3D printer is meticulously building 43 new hotel units and 18 residential homes across an expansive 40 acres.A captivating video shared by Reuters on YouTube provides a glimpse into the remarkable process of constructing the world’s first 3D-printed hotel.In the video, El Cosmico owner Liz Lambert says that this is the world's first 3D-printed hotel . The partners behind the project - US-based 3D printing company ICON and architects Bjarke Ingels Group - can also be seen explaining the project.""This technology allows for unprecedented creativity,"" Lambert said highlighting the ability to easily incorporate unique features that would be expensive with conventional building methods.She said:The video shows the first two structures underway are a three-bedroom home and a single-room hotel unit, both featuring 12-foot high, curvy walls made from a ‘special’ cement-based material called Lavacrete .These walls are being ""printed"" by ICON's Vulcan, a massive 3D printer that stands 15.5 feet tall, weighs 4.75 tons and spans 46.5 feet wide. A print technician oversees the process as Vulcan's robotic arm and nozzle layers the Lavacrete.ICON CEO and founder Jason Ballard also explained that factors like humidity, temperature, and sunlight can affect the material's performance. Therefore, workers constantly monitor these conditions and fine-tune the Lavacrete ingredients accordingly.","A colossal 3D printer, the size of a crane, is currently constructing the world’s first 3D-printed hotel in Texas, USA.

What is the “Peaklight” malware

""This memory-only dropper decrypts and executes a PowerShell-based downloader. This PowerShell-based downloader is being tracked as PEAKLIGHT,”

How hackers can use Peaklight to infect Windows PCs

Connection to a hidden source: It connects to a content delivery network (CDN) that conceals harmful JavaScript code. This code executes directly in a computer's memory, leaving no trace on the system’s hard drive.

It connects to a content delivery network (CDN) that conceals harmful JavaScript code. This code executes directly in a computer's memory, leaving no trace on the system’s hard drive. Unleashing the malware downloader : The JavaScript then activates a PowerShell script named Peaklight.

The JavaScript then activates a PowerShell script named Peaklight. Downloading more threats: Peaklight acts as a downloader, retrieving additional malware from a remote server. This could include dangerous programs like Lumma Stealer, Hijack Loader, and CryptBot, which can steal user data or give attackers control of the user's computer.

""PEAKLIGHT is an obfuscated PowerShell-based downloader that is part of a multi-stage execution chain that checks for the presence of ZIP archives in hard-coded file paths. If the archives do not exist, the downloader will reach out to a CDN site download the remotely hosted archive file and save it to disk.”

A novel type of malware known as Peaklight has emerged and is specifically targeting individuals who engage in the downloading of movies from illicit websites. This “advanced” malware is designed to infect Windows computers, ultimately deploying information stealers and loaders. Security researchers affiliated with Google’s cybersecurity firm Mandiant have issued a stark warning regarding the potential risks associated with visiting such websites, which encompass not only legal repercussions but also the exposure to malware such as Peaklight.In a blog post, Mandiant claims that Peaklight is a new and stealthy malware that operates entirely within a computer's memory, leaving no trace on the hard drive which makes it difficult to detect. Security researchers claimed that this malware is designed to discreetly download additional harmful software onto infected Windows systems.Mandiant noted.Mandiant explained that Peaklight uses a covert PowerShell script to deploy additional malware onto infected systems. This method facilitates the distribution of harmful programs such as Lumma Stealer , Hijack Loader, and CryptBot. These programs are offered as services for rent, enabling cyber attackers to steal information or take control of compromised computers.As per the report, cybercriminals are spreading the malware through fake movie downloads. For this, hackers are hiding dangerous Windows shortcut files (LNKs) within ZIP folders disguised as popular films.Once opened, the LNK file triggers the following chain reaction:The report noted that the malware was particularly stealthy because it operates entirely within the computer's memory (RAM). This makes it very difficult for traditional antivirus software to detect, as most antivirus programs primarily scan the user’s hard drive for threats.Mandiant researchers Aaron Lee and Praveeth D'Souza said:","Malware known as Peaklight has emerged and is specifically targeting individuals who engage in the downloading of movies from illicit websites.

Take a look at the email

Dell employees express discontent

Dell’s recent announcement mandating a return to the office has sparked a wave of discontent among its employees. Starting September 30, the global sales team at Dell will be required to work from office five days a week. “The Sales floor is a unique environment that combines high energy with a culture of collaboration and continuous improvement. To harness this energy and grow skills, we believe our sales teams need to be together in the office,” the company said in an email to its employees.The email reads “This sales force has a culture of winning and a reputation of outpacing the competition. We are the best in the business! That doesn't come without dedicated focus, perseverance and grit. To uphold this legacy, we must continuously work at it. To grow faster than the market and take share, we must always be sharpening our edge.”“The Sales floor is a unique environment that combines high energy with a culture of collaboration and continuous improvement. To harness this energy and grow skills, we believe our sales teams need to be together in the office. Additionally, our data shows that sales teams are more productive when onsite.”“With that in mind, starting Monday, Sept. 30, the expectation is that ALL Global Sales team members who can work from a Dell office be onsite five days a week, regardless of role. Field sellers are expected to spend five days a week with customers and partners or in a Dell Technologies office. Field sellers who can't go into a Dell office should prioritize time spent in person with customers and partners. Remote sales team members who can't go into a Dell office should continue to work remotely. More communications pertaining to remote workers will be sent in the coming weeks.”Dell employees are not pleased with the return-to-office push, as evidenced by a viral Reddit post. The post, which appears to have been shared by a Dell employee, gained significant traction. The caption reads, “Just received this email from leadership, and starting this Monday, we’re all expected to return to the office five days a week for at least six hours each day at Dell.” Additionally, the post includes a screenshot of the email received by Dell employees regarding the latest return-to-office mandate.Commenting on the post, a user said “Expect a drop in productivity as soon as everyone is back in the office. Guaranteed”. Another replied “Hmm. Dell is sinking rapidly. I wonder if that is why they are doing this. Is this some way for Mr. Dell to recoup all his money in commercial real estate and line his golden parachute at the workers' expense?”.A third user said “Dell needs to not do this. They're already shit with the staff they have. God help them if the remote employees quit because of this.” Another user said “This is a layoff round. They are trying to get people to quit.","Starting September 30, the global sales team at Dell will be required to work from office five days a week. “The Sales floor is a unique environment that combines high energy with a culture of collaboration and continuous improvement,” the company said in an email to its employees.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113737003,imgsize-13138,width-400,resizemode-4/113737003.jpg"

During a recent conversation with LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman , Nadella emphasised the critical qualities needed to navigate the evolving business landscape.""I think the world needs today, more than anything else from leaders, are optimism and energy ,"" Nadella stated.""It's easy to be down on everything [but] my true measure of any leader is who can come into a situation, bring clarity, generate energy, and solve over-constrained problems. As long as you do those three things, I think the world will be a better place.""Nadella's definition comes at a time when companies are facing significant challenges, particularly in managing remote work and employee expectations. The Microsoft CEO highlighted a ""productivity paradox"" that many organisations are experiencing:""Eighty-five percent of managers think their employees aren't working hard enough, while 85 percent of employees report feeling exhausted and overworked. And these are real statistics!"" he revealed.To address this disconnect, Nadella advocates for a data-driven approach to leadership. ""Dogma won't fix this issue,"" he explained. ""Leaders need to focus on clear, aligned goals and use data to measure output and performance.""The Microsoft CEP also stressed the importance of developing new soft skills to effectively manage employees in the changing work environment. ""People come for people, not policy,"" Nadella observed, suggesting that leaders must learn to create engaging occasions and events to bring teams together.""As leaders, we have to learn how to bring clarity to what is the output that you'd like to see. What are the measures of it and then using that to see whether it is working or not and then create the norms,"" he added.Nadella's insights offer a roadmap for leadership in the face of evolving workplace challenges. By focusing on optimism, energy, clarity, and data-driven problem-solving, leaders can work to bridge the gap between management expectations and employee experiences, ultimately fostering a more productive and harmonious workplace.","Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has outlined his vision of a "" true leader"" He emphasised the critical qualities needed to navigate the evolving business landscape.
