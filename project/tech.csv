"“AI never been to the club,” Grammy-nominated rapper on if AI would ever replace musicians",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ai-never-been-to-the-club-grammy-nominated-rapper-on-if-ai-would-ever-replace-musicians/articleshow/110041141.cms,"Grammy-nominated rapper Bas believes that while AI is changing the music industry , it can't yet capture the human experiences and emotions that make music powerful. He shared his thoughts at the recent ""Leading with AI"" conference at Harvard University .""The core of writing music, you're trying to evoke an emotion out of your audience, whether it's joy, heartbreak, whatever the case may be,"" Bas said.""When I try to give it those prompts, it's a little tough to get that across.""Bas talked about a song he made with AI. When he heard the AI-made beat, he imagined meeting a girl at a club and trying to talk to her. But as he wrote the lyrics and melody, he realised AI didn't really understand that experience. ""I'm like, 'man, AI never been to the club,'"" he said.Many artists are worried about how AI will affect their jobs and the quality of their art. ""There are a lot of people in our industry, a lot of creators , where AI is almost a dirty word right now,"" Bas explained. ""They're just threatened by what it could mean to their livelihood and to the art forms.""But Bas thinks human taste will still be important, even as AI gets better. ""At the end of the day, there's going to be a certain level of human taste that's still required to prompt the AI to create something that we'll all enjoy,"" he said.Bas's view reflects the ongoing debate about balancing technology and human skill in the music industry. While AI can streamline certain aspects of music creation, it may never fully capture the deep human emotions and experiences that are essential to great music. As AI advances, the music industry will have to find ways to leverage its benefits without sacrificing the human touch that enables artists to create truly moving and meaningful works.","Rapper Bas believes that while AI is changing the music industry, it can't yet capture the human experiences and emotions that make music powerful.

“We don’t need lectures from western companies…”: Ola CEO Bhavish Agarwal on ending ties with Microsoft's Azure cloud services,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/we-dont-need-lectures-from-western-companies-ola-ceo-bhavish-agarwal-on-ending-ties-with-microsofts-azure-cloud-services/articleshow/110039437.cms,"Ola’s plans to move from Microsoft’s Azure cloud service



“Since LinkedIn is owned by Microsoft and Ola is a big customer of Azure, we’ve decided to move our entire workload out of Azure to our own Krutrim cloud within the next week. It is a challenge as all developers know, but my team is so charged up about doing this. Any other developer who wants to move out of Azure, we will offer a full year of free cloud usage. As long as you don’t go back to Azure after that! Mail us on exitazure@olakrutrim.com. Offer is perpetually open!”

How this move will affect Microsoft



Ola Group of Companies ' founder and CEO Bhavish Aggarwal has confirmed that the company is severing ties with its existing cloud service provider, Microsoft Azure. In a post shared on social media platform X (earlier Twitter), Aggarwal also announced that the cab-hailing service is set to move its entire workload to the company’s own AI firm Krutrim.This move comes days after Aggarwal's post on “pronoun illness” was removed by Microsoft-owned job-search portal LinkedIn.He criticised Microsoft for removing his post from the social networking platform LinkedIn. Aggarwal claimed that Microsoft’s artificial intelligence (AI) tool was ""imposing a political ideology on Indian users that’s unsafe, sinister"".In the X post, Aggarwal said:According to a report by MoneyControl, ANI Technologies-owned Ola is one of the biggest consumers for Microsoft.

Meesho gets $275 million more to take on Flipkart and Amazon,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/meesho-gets-275-million-more-to-take-on-flipkart-and-amazon/articleshow/110042605.cms,"What the funding signifies

IPO preparations underway

Meesho , the leading Indian social commerce platform, has secured $275 million in the initial tranche of a larger funding round. This investment, a mix of primary and secondary share sales, comes from both existing and new investors. The Bengaluru-based company is aiming to raise a total of $600 million, with a final valuation to be determined upon completion of the round.According to a report in Economic Times, a regulatory filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) also indicated share transfer at Meesho’s US parent firm without offering further details.This funding round signifies Meesho's impressive growth trajectory. The company, which competes with giants like Amazon India and Flipkart , has raised a total of $1.36 billion since its inception in 2015.Meesho's funding strategy has evolved. Initially, early investors sought partial exits. However, the focus has shifted to raising fresh capital for future growth. This shift reflects investor confidence in Meesho's ability to maintain operational growth while reducing financial strain. Additionally, the current valuation represents a strategic move, positioned slightly below Meesho's peak valuation.Meesho last raised primary capital of $570 million in September 2021. A top ecommerce investor — known for having taken a bet on Flipkart early on — has also reportedly been in discussion with the company to invest in the new round but as per ET report it is not clear if it’s finally participating in the funding process. “Meesho’s ability to sustain operating growth while having reduced its monthly burn significantly over the last year has drawn investor interest. It’s also happening at a discount to the past peak valuation of nearly $5 billion,” another person aware of the talks told the publication.Meesho is actively considering reversing its US incorporation, a move often undertaken by Indian startups before an initial public offering (IPO) in India. This process involves tax implications, which the current funding round aims to address.Overall, this funding round positions Meesho for continued success in the competitive Indian e-commerce landscape.","Meesho has secured $275 million in the initial tranche of a larger funding round.

Emails Raise Red Flags

Indian intelligence agencies successfully exposed a hoax bomb threat campaign targeting schools in Delhi and Ahmedabad. The culprit, traced to Faislabad, Pakistan, is suspected to be an agent of Pakistan 's ISI intelligence agency.Police believe the emails aimed to create mass panic. The Delhi FIR alleges the threats were intended to ""disturb public peace"" through mass panic.In Ahmedabad, the emails arrived just before the Lok Sabha elections, potentially aiming to disrupt the polls.The intelligence agency employed advanced infiltration techniques and a social engineering tactic known as a ""honeytrap"" to identify the perpetrator. Investigators discovered the emails originated from mail.ru addresses linked to a chat platform owned by a Russian firm.Significantly, Russian intelligence reportedly shared crucial information that aided the investigation. The findings, including the suspect's location within a Pakistani military cantonment, bolster suspicions of Pakistani involvement, possibly backed by Chinese intelligence. Indian authorities in Delhi and Gujarat have been informed of the initial investigation results.Both bomb threats exhibited similar characteristics. The Delhi emails, signed with the term ""Sawarim"" associated with ISIS propaganda, included religious verses. The Ahmedabad emails originated from a ""Tauheedl"" address, with the sender identifying himself as a ""Tauheed Warrior"" threatening suicide attacks.Investigators traced the ""tauheedl"" address to an account belonging to ""Tauheed Liyaqat,"" linked to another account under the name ""Ahmad Javed."" Both accounts exhibited activity on gaming platforms.","Indian intelligence agencies successfully exposed a hoax bomb threat campaign targeting schools in Delhi and Ahmedabad.

NPCI may extend this UPI deadline and why it’s good news for Google and PhonePe,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/npci-may-extend-this-upi-deadline-and-why-its-good-news-for-google-and-phonepe/articleshow/109983902.cms,"Challenges in introducing incentives for UPI service providers

The National Payments Corporation of India ( NPCI ) is set to extend the deadline for implementing a 30% market share cap on companies processing payments through the Unified Payment Interface ( UPI ) by one to two years, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.This decision is expected to benefit Google Pay and Walmart-backed PhonePe , which currently dominate the UPI payments market.UPI, India's most popular digital payment method in the country, processes over 11 billion transactions per month. PhonePe holds a 48.3% market share, followed by Google Pay at 37.4%, while their closest competitor, Paytm , has seen its share drop to 8% due to regulatory challenges.The NPCI initially planned to enforce the market share cap in January 2021 but postponed the deadline to January 1, 2025. According to sources, a final decision on the extension will be communicated closer to the deadline.The decision to extend the deadline is likely to be criticised by other players in the ecosystem, who have been urging the NPCI to follow through on its commitment. Some companies have proposed solutions, such as incentives that benefit smaller players.The NPCI and the Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) also face challenges in introducing more incentives for UPI service providers. Unlike credit card issuers like Mastercard and Visa, which charge merchants a fee for consumer transactions, UPI essentially functions at no cost to merchants.According to the report, NPCI had hoped that Meta's instant messaging app WhatsApp, which also offers the option for UPI payments, would help break the duopoly. However, the app had only acquired 0.2% market share by April this year.The RBI held a meeting on Wednesday, per the sources, with key players in the UPI ecosystem to discuss strategies for scaling UPI infrastructure, expanding the product portfolio, addressing challenges, and brainstorming solutions to tackle these issues.An NPCI spokesperson declined to comment on all market share questions, and sources say the regulator may make changes to its plan by the end of the year.","The National Payments Corporation of India ( NPCI) is set to extend the deadline for implementing a 30% market share cap on companies processing payments through the Unified Payment Interface ( UPI ) by one to two years.

Fintech platform Paytm , owned by One 97 Communications Ltd has reportedly forayed into ride-hailing service with its new auto-rickshaw booking feature via its app through Open Network for Digital Commerce ( ONDC ).The new service aims to challenge both Ola and Uber , the two companies that currently rule the market.A person close to the development of this feature told Moneycontrol that “There is a lot of software testing and integration that goes into each rollout.There is no reason why Paytm will not also get into cab bookings like Ola and Uber as well at a later stage”.As per the report, the feature is currently in the testing phase and has gone live only for select Paytm users.The Auto-rikshaw booking feature is powered by Namma Yatri to onboard auto-rikshaw drivers on the platform and the services are currently live in Bengaluru, Chennai and the National Capital Region.The feature has been placed under the dedicated Shopping section and select users are seeing the auto rikshaw booking banner within the app. Tapping on the banner redirects users to the auto-booking interface where users can enter pickup and drop locations to book their ride.It is also important to note that the entire ONDC platform on Paytm is backed by PAI Platforms earlier known as Paym Commerce which is backed by Paytm founder and chief Vijay Shekhar Sharma.Other than the auto rikshaw booking, Paytm also facilitates several other services via ONDC, including food delivery, grocery, fashion and electronics.In other news, PaiPai, an ONDC app by PAI Platforms, accidentally got listed on Google Play Store earlier this month, however, it has now been removed.","Auto-rikshaw booking on Paytm is in testing phase and has gone live only for select users.

Employees fear more job losses

Dell has announced a new policy that will monitor how often its employees who split their time between the office and home actually show up to work. The company plans to use electronic badge scans , VPN log-ins, and a colour-coded system to keep tabs on employee presence in the office. However, the change, which starts on May 13, as per the Register, has upset many workers who think the rules are too strict and might lead to more people losing their jobs.Under the new policy, employees will be graded based on their presence in the office for at least 39 days per quarter, or approximately three days per week.Dell's human resources software will provide weekly updates on employees' on-site presence, accompanied by colour-coded ratings. A blue flag indicates ""consistent onsite presence,"" green signifies ""regular onsite presence,"" yellow denotes ""some onsite presence,"" and red indicates ""limited onsite presence.""A Dell spokesperson told the Times of India, ""As we've shared, team members globally in hybrid roles will be onsite at a Dell Technologies office at least 39 days per quarter (on average 3 days a week). In today's global technology revolution, we believe in-person connections paired with a flexible approach are critical to driving innovation and value differentiation.""However, the policy has been met with significant backlash from employees.One source familiar with the matter told The Register, ""In the latest Jeff Clarke return-to-grade-school initiative, HR will be keeping an attendance report card on employees, grading them at four levels based on how well they meet the goal of being in the office 39 days a quarter. Employees who do not meet the attendance requirement will have their status escalated up the ladder to Jeff Clarke [the Chief Operating Officer], who apparently believes that being a hall monitor trumps growing revenue.""Another source described the situation as a ""shit show,"" with managers offering inconsistent guidance on the consequences of receiving red flags for limited on-site presence.This new rule follows Dell's statement in February that employees who work from home most of the time might have a harder time getting promoted and are more likely to be fired if the company needs to cut jobs.Some workers think this is a sneaky way to get rid of people, especially women, who are more likely to want to work from home. The company has laid off at least 13,000 people since the start of 2023, with some anticipating further layoffs over the summer.According to sources, approximately half of Dell's U.S. employees and two-thirds of its international workers are classified as remote. One source said, “Dell is tracking badge-ins and VPN connections to ensure employees are onsite when they claim they are (to deter 'coffee badging' or scanning your badge then going immediately home),"" another source told, noting that the company is doing this to quantity how many of the staff are choosing to remain remote after the mandate.The strict tracking of office attendance is a big change from how Dell used to handle remote work before the pandemic. One employee said, ""Even before the pandemic, they never really pushed people to be in the office. They used to say, 'Work happens wherever you make it happen.' The office was often empty a lot of the time, like after lunch or before holidays.""","Dell has announced a new policy that will monitor how often its employees who split their time between the office and home actually show up to work.

Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 may get an AI-powered health update,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-may-get-an-ai-powered-health-update/articleshow/109969985.cms,"AI to convert PPG signals into ECG signals

Samsung is reportedly working on a feature that will use artificial intelligence ( AI ) to detect AFiB (Atrial Fibrillation). The South Korean tech giant has reportedly filed a patent for the same. It is likely that the feature may come with the next generation Galaxy Watch.AFiB is an irregular and often rapid heart rate that can lead to blood clots, strokes and other heart conditions.Over the years, health features have become dominant features on smart wearables, especially smartwatches. Apple introduced its ECG app in 2019 with Apple Watch Series 4 to alert users of irregular heart beats or AFiB. Samsung also allows users to record and monitor ECG (electrocardiogram) data to track heart’s rhythm and health.So then why the need for a new method?Because Samsung seems to believe that the current methods of monitoring are not necessarily accurate.The new patent filed by Samsung suggests that it aims to detect AfiB with the help of generative AI . With the help of AI, photoplethysmograph (PPG) signals will be converted into ECG signals. A PPG signal has several components including volumetric changes in arterial blood which is associated with cardiac activity. It measures the amount of light absorbed and reflected by human tissues.Meanwhile, Samsung is planning to launch a new premium smartwatch. In the financial report for Q1, 2024, the company revealed that it will launch a new premium smartwatch model which will join the Galaxy Watch 7 series.“For smartwatches, the MX Business will strive to meet demand for upgrades through the launch of new premium models,” mentions the company.Although the report didn't specify the exact release date or offer further details, it mentions that the desired upgrades requested by users will be incorporated into the higher-end models.Recent online rumours suggest that Samsung may launch three models of the upcoming Galaxy Watch 7 series.

Over the years, Japanese animation has delivered numerous romantic tales, ranging from light-hearted comedies to deeply emotional dramas.For romance enthusiasts, going through so many anime options can be overwhelming. However, there are several exceptional romance anime series that truly shine above the rest.Here is a curated list of top romance anime series , compiled by Game Rant, along with their respective rankings.Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie stirred mixed reactions upon its debut in Spring 2022, often compared to ""My Dress-Up Darling"" but standing out as a unique slice-of-life anime centred around a charming couple, Shikimori and Yuu Izumi.One distinctive aspect of the series is its portrayal of the main couple already in a relationship, a rarity in anime. While the episodes focus on everyday moments, they paint a wholesome picture of young love with two endearing characters navigating the nuances of romance.Describing Bakemonogatari as a straightforward romance might be a stretch, but this instalment of Monogatari indeed focuses on and highlights the relationship between Koyomi Araragi and Hitagi Senjougahara. Their initial interactions are unconventional, involving a stapler to the face, but Araragi's determination to assist Senjougahara with her curse ultimately brings them closer.Despite the surreal and eccentric nature of Monogatari, the romance between Araragi and Senjougahara is remarkably grounded and healthy. While the series introduces other potential romantic interests, their relationship remains steadfast and central to the narrative.""Sing 'Yesterday' for Me"" presents romance in a refreshingly realistic manner compared to many other anime. The series takes a classic love triangle and steers it in an unexpected direction by the end, resulting in a highly satisfying conclusion that portrays how failed romances can evolve into strong friendships.Directed by Yoshiyuki Fujiwara, known for his work on popular anime like ""Attack on Titan"" and ""Sword Art Online,"" the shift to a show with such a different tone demonstrates his versatility and mastery in storytelling across diverse genres.""My Happy Marriage"" emerged as one of the standout romance anime of Summer 2023, adapted from Akumi Agitogi's novel series. Set in an alternate Meiji Restoration era with supernatural elements, the story follows Miyo, who endures mistreatment from her stepfamily despite her privileged background. Her family arranges her marriage to a notorious military figure known for rejecting wives quickly, with rejection spelling disaster for Miyo. However, Kiyoka surprises everyone by taking an interest in Miyo and becoming incensed by her family's cruelty.The anime delves into the lasting impact of Miyo's abuse, highlighting her struggle to regain self-worth, even with Kiyoka's support. Kiyoka himself is a complex character with hidden motives behind his initial attraction to Miyo, although his feelings for her are genuine.While the romance between Miyo and Kiyoka is heartwarming, ""My Happy Marriage"" falls short in other areas. The supernatural elements can seem disjointed, and the villains are one-dimensional despite being detestable.Based on Fumita Yanagida's popular and finished manga, ""Tomo-chan Is a Girl!"" stood out as one of Winter 2023's most amusing romantic comedies. Tomo and Jun share a close friendship, but Jun sees Tomo strictly as a friend, unaware of her romantic feelings.While romance is central to its characters, ""Tomo-chan Is a Girl!"" leans heavily into comedy. Tomo and Jun's dynamic is charming, and they're supported by entertaining characters like Misuzu and Carol. Despite its comedic tone, the chemistry between Tomo and Jun develops convincingly over the season. Unlike some romance anime, Tomo-chan excels in portraying why its leads are compatible without difficulty.Teen romance anime often dominate the genre, but there are exceptions worth noting. ""Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku"" is primarily a workplace comedy that revolves around two couples: the newly formed pair of Hirotaka Nifuji and Narumi Momose, and the more established couple, Tarou Kabakura and Hanako Koyanagi. The focus remains on Hirotaka and Narumi, with the series emphasising humour over romance, but Tarou and Hanako's relationship is depicted realistically.Despite being childhood friends, Narumi struggles to see Hirotaka as a potential romantic interest, a dynamic that persists throughout the series. The anime's brevity limits the depth of these relationships, but ""Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku"" provides an entertaining journey within its runtime.""Romantic Killer"" cleverly parodies romance and harem anime while paying homage to their core strengths. Anzu, a girl with no interest in boys, is suddenly thrust into a reverse harem scenario by a magical being, disrupting her life of gaming and chocolate consumption. Unamused by her newfound romantic entanglements with unfamiliar guys, Anzu navigates this unconventional situation with scepticism.Primarily a comedy, ""Romantic Killer"" aims to elicit laughter from its audience, often succeeding with its humour rooted in its origins as a shonen manga, characterised by exaggerated facial expressions.Though not always aiming for emotional depth, the anime treats its characters and their relationships seriously. Anzu shines as a compelling lead, and the male characters introduced as potential partners are well-developed. ""Romantic Killer"" offers a delightful blend of humour and romance for those seeking an entertaining and unconventional love story.""The Angel Next Door Spoils Me Rotten"" captivates viewers from the start for several reasons. Firstly, Project No.9's animation is impressive, featuring clean and detailed character designs. Secondly, and most importantly, the main characters exhibit instant chemistry, evident when Amane offers his umbrella to a soaked Mahiru, sparking a connection.Throughout the series, despite the frequent presence of both leads on screen, ""The Angel Next Door Spoils Me Rotten"" effectively delves into their individual personalities while also developing their friendship.Rumiko Takahashi is celebrated as a legendary mangaka, known for classics like Inuyasha, Ranma 1/2, and Urusei Yatsura. While most of her renowned works fall within the shonen genre, Takahashi has also ventured into seinen storytelling. Maison Ikkoku stands out as one of her most mature works, emphasising romance as its primary theme.Unlike Takahashi's prominent shonen series that explore various genres such as comedy and action alongside romance, Maison Ikkoku focuses squarely on romantic elements, enriched with drama, character development, and humour.The central relationship features Kyouko and Yuusaku, both drawn to each other but hindered by their circumstances. Kyouko, grieving the recent loss of her husband, is hesitant to move forward. Meanwhile, Yuusaku, deeply in love with Kyouko, doubts his worthiness as a student. The anime chronicles their journeys of growth, healing, and mutual misunderstanding, complemented by well-developed secondary characters.Insomniacs After School emerged as the standout romance of Spring 2023, adapted from Makoto Ojiro's esteemed seinen manga. The story revolves around two students plagued by insomnia, a burden they carried alone until they met at their school's observatory. Isaki and Ganta form an immediate bond, which deepens as they work together to revive the Astronomy Club, driven by their shared need to preserve their newfound sanctuary.The anime boasts impeccable pacing, skillfully depicting the protagonists' isolation due to insomnia and the subtle solace they find in each other. While romance is a central theme, the series prioritises developing Ganta and Isaki's friendship before advancing their relationship, emphasising the depth of their connection beyond shared circumstances.Kokoro Connect injects a supernatural twist into a classic love triangle scenario. The story centers around Taichi, Iori, Yui, Yoshifumi, and Himeko, students of the Student Cultural Research Club, whose lives take a turn when they receive supernatural abilities from a mysterious being named Heartseed.As they grapple with these newfound powers, the group experiences sensory phenomena that challenge their relationships and reveal hidden aspects of their personalities. The anime is rich in character development, providing an engaging and thought-provoking experience.Maid Sama! carries many tropes that might derail other romance anime: an overly perfect male lead, a strong female protagonist reduced to a damsel, and an unnecessary love triangle. Despite these shortcomings, Maid Sama! shines through its strong personality.The heart of Maid Sama! lies in the relationship between Takumi Usui, a charming heartthrob, and Misaki Ayuzawa, a strict student council president with a busy schedule balancing school, home, and work. When Takumi discovers Misaki's secret job at a maid cafe, it opens a new perspective on the usually composed president.In ""Rascal Does Not Dream Of Bunny Girl Senpai,"" romance plays a subtle yet compelling role that defines the series. The story centers on Sakuta Azusagawa, a high school student drawn to girls suffering from Adolescence Syndrome, a condition linked to their insecurities.While the anime unfolds through different arcs focusing on various girls, the standout is the initial saga featuring Mai Sakurajima, an actress who forms a close bond with Sakuta. Their dynamic crackles with romantic tension, warmth, and clever banter. Although not always in the foreground, their relationship develops steadily across subsequent arcs, leading to a satisfying sequel in the form of a feature film.Wakana Gojou and Marin Kitagawa inhabit completely contrasting worlds. Gojou, isolated and reserved, keeps himself apart from others due to his passion for hina dolls, fearing ridicule. In contrast, Kitagawa is popular, outgoing, and self-assured.Despite their differences, Kitagawa becomes intrigued by cosplay and sees Gojou as the ideal person to create outfits for her. ""My Dress-Up Darling"" is a charming, humorous, and beautifully animated romance anime that excels in executing classic genre tropes with finesse.""Toradora!"" is a beloved slice-of-life romantic comedy that offers a wonderful entry point into the genre. The story revolves around Ryuji Yusaku and Taiga Aisaka, two students who have crushes on each other's best friends.Both Ryuji and Taiga are viewed as outcasts—Ryuji due to his intimidating appearance and Taiga because of her fiery temper. They team up to assist each other in their romantic pursuits. The series delves into their evolving dynamic and the humorous mishaps that ensue as they navigate their intertwined love lives.""The Pet Girl of Sakurasou"" depicts the journey of an eccentric group of characters as they navigate growth and self-discovery. Sorata Kanda is forced to move into the unconventional Sakura House after being kicked out of his school's main dorms.In Sakura House, Sorata encounters talented yet troubled students. When a peculiar young artist joins the dorm, Sorata takes on the responsibility of helping her adjust to her new life. The series delves into the interactions among the dorm mates, their personal aspirations, and the interconnected nature of their relationships.""Ouran High School Host Club"" is a delightful reverse harem anime filled with lighthearted and meaningful moments. Haruhi Fujioka accidentally breaks an antique vase belonging to her school's Host Club and must repay her debt by disguising herself as a boy and working as a host.The series excels in developing Haruhi's character along with her fellow hosts, providing insight into their motivations and personalities. It's a must-watch for shojo fans, featuring a memorable cast of characters that carries the show through its run.Kyoto Animation has produced many beloved anime, and ""Love, Chunibyo & Other Delusions!"" is among them. The series centers around a phenomenon known as Chunibyo, where adolescents have grandiose and unrealistic delusions.Yuta Togashi, who has outgrown his delusional phase, aims for a normal high school life. However, things take a turn when his classmate, Rikka Takanashi, reminds him of his past and tries to pull him back into the world of Chunibyo with her own delusions. The series delves into their relationship as Yuta unravels the triggers behind Rikka's delusions.The trope of opposites attracting may be overused, but when done well, it can lead to a captivating romantic comedy. ""Kimi ni Todoke"" explores the endearing friendship between the shy Sawako Kuronuma and the popular Shouta Kazehaya. Sawako, often mistaken for Sadako from ""The Ring,"" is isolated at school due to her appearance, making it challenging for her to break out of her shell. Fortunately, Kazehaya is just the right person to help her.""Kimi ni Todoke"" is a delightful and heartwarming anime with well-developed characters who evolve as the story unfolds. While it adheres to typical romance anime pacing, the journey remains engaging and enjoyable.Unlike most romance stories that focus on the process of falling in love, ""Tonikawa: Over The Moon For You"" follows a married couple who have already reached that point. As a result, the anime adopts a slice-of-life approach, showcasing Nasa and Tsukasa's daily life and antics rather than a typical romantic journey. ""Tonikawa"" doesn't rely on dramatic highs but instead offers a pleasant and light-hearted experience.While this anime may not appeal to everyone, it serves as a refreshing departure from more melodramatic romance shows. Despite their tendency to blush at the slightest physical contact, Nasa and Tsukasa are refreshingly direct in expressing their feelings, making them both witty and likeable characters.This romantic anime shines because of its main character, Takeo Gouda. His towering, imposing presence contrasts beautifully with his heartfelt affection for the delicate Rinko, which is truly heartwarming. Takeo's efforts to play matchmaker for Rinko with his best friend, despite his own feelings, demonstrate his genuine kindness.Viewers will undoubtedly root for Takeo and Rinko's endearing relationship. ""My Love Story!!"" delivers the goods without delay, as the main characters are dating for most of the episodes, bypassing the typical slow build-up to a confession.""A Sign of Affection"" is a heartwarming romantic comedy centred on college-age love and the challenges of communication. While not the sole focus of the story, Yuki and Itsuomi stand out as the main couple, instantly captivating viewers. Yuki, who is hearing-impaired, communicates using sign language, text, and by reading lips, while Itsuomi is a world traveller passionate about learning languages. Their connection begins on a train and grows stronger with each subsequent encounter.The anime beautifully captures the intense emotions of falling in love, highlighted by a poignant moment in the opening episode. With an older cast, ""A Sign of Affection"" takes on a more mature tone compared to typical romance anime. Throughout the season, Yuki and Itsuomi become increasingly comfortable around each other, resulting in consistently endearing interactions.This romantic anime is ideal for LGBTQ+ viewers seeking representation on screen, but its well-crafted storytelling makes it enjoyable for all audiences. The heartwarming romance blossoms between Mafuyu and Ritsuka as Mafuyu learns to play guitar and sing in Ritsuka's band.Watching Mafuyu's growing confidence alongside the romantic tension creates a compelling series that's hard to resist. The accompanying movie is also outstanding and a must-watch continuation of the series.Nana is one of the most renowned and beloved shoujo anime of all time, a must-watch for fans of romance and beyond. The series follows two women named Nana, seemingly different but navigating curiously similar life situations that lead to separate outcomes.Without giving away how their stories intertwine, Nana's 47 episodes delve into the protagonists' perspectives on love through various relationships. Grounded in reality, the anime explores complex characters who, despite occasional extremes, face accountability for their actions.Your Lie in April, one of the most famous romance anime, revolves around two music prodigies: Kousei Arima and Kaori Miyazono. Kousei, grappling with depression after his mother's death, loses his passion for the piano and withdraws from the performance arts. One day, he hears Kaori playing her violin with such freedom that it reignites his love for music and sparks his admiration for her.The anime delves into themes of grief, life, love, and music. Kousei's journey toward self-healing is profound, marked by heartbreak, but also punctuated by moments of beauty, tenderness, and joy.In this anime, Miyuki and Kaguya engage in a battle of wits to avoid confessing their love first, using their intellect and skills to outmaneuver each other. Both are determined not to be seen as the one who gives in.Their antics running the student council at an elite school with their friends are uproariously funny yet also contain heartwarming moments that will make viewers cheer. Season 3 of Kaguya-sama: Love is War, which aired in Spring 2022, leaned heavily into comedy but also devoted more time to developing Miyuki and Kaguya's relationship and touching on other romances.If the anime follows the manga, the next season of Love is War promises to be predominantly romantic. If successful, this upcoming release could elevate Kaguya-sama to the pinnacle of romance anime.This anime consists of two parts: Clannad and After Story. The latter surpasses the former by a wide margin, but watching Clannad is essential to fully appreciate the impact of After Story. While it features a diverse cast of supporting characters, the heart of the show revolves around Tomoya Okazaki and Nagisa Furukawa, delivering a profound narrative.Unlike typical romance series, Clannad After Story unfolds beyond high school, depicting the growth of Tomoya and Nagisa as individuals and as a couple. The anime tackles real-life challenges without glossing over them, offering a genuine exploration of common struggles.The Dangers in My Heart is truly brilliant. At first glance, it may seem like another typical shounen romance where a popular girl falls for an ordinary loner guy. These stories often offer little beyond wish fulfilment, and The Dangers in My Heart initially appears to fit that mould. Yet, the anime stands out.Ichikawa is an average guy with few friends who daydreams about unusual things. While the anime doesn't delve deeply into these thoughts, it doesn't ignore them either, leaving Ichikawa with a poor first impression. On the other hand, Anna is a cheerful but shy girl who loves food and works as a model. After a chance encounter at the school library, the two start spending time together, developing a friendship that hints at something deeper. Anna encourages Ichikawa to break out of his shell, leading to significant changes in him over the course of two seasons.Although slow-paced initially, The Dangers in My Heart evolves into something special by the end of season 1, maintaining its momentum in the subsequent cour and establishing itself as one of the best romance anime of all time. Anna and Ichikawa are both exceptional characters, but Anna's depth is what elevates the show. She's not just an idealised plot device; she's a fully realised character with insecurities, quirks, and vulnerabilities. Her interest in Ichikawa feels genuine, and vice versa. This is a rare quality in romance anime.Fruits Basket is the definitive romance anime, masterfully blending drama and comedy. Tooru Honda, a lovable protagonist, faces life's challenges until she moves in with the Souma family. The Soumas, particularly Yuki, are school idols hiding a shocking secret that alters perceptions.Love triangles often lack depth, favouring one partner over the other. Fruits Basket defies this norm with its compelling love triangle, where each character is fully developed. Across three seasons, Fruits Basket takes viewers on an unforgettable journey.Also read | 15 best anime series of all time; here's the list","Japanese animation has delivered numerous romantic tales, ranging from light- hearted comedies to deeply emotional dramas.

Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) fintech company Simpl has reportedly laid off approximately 160-170 employees across various departments.

This includes core operations, interns, and call center agents. The company's D2C (Direct to Customer) checkout vertical was also affected.A source reportedly told Moneycontrol that the company held a brief town hall on May 8.

During summer months, many households experience a significant increase in electricity consumption due to higher cooling needs. While staying comfortable during hot weather is essential, it doesn't have to come at the cost of soaring electricity bills. By implementing strategic energy-saving practices, you can reduce your summer electricity expenses without sacrificing comfort.Here you can explore several effective ways to save on summer electricity bills, offering practical tips and strategies that can help you minimise energy consumption and lower your utility costs during the warmer months.From optimising your cooling system to adopting energy-efficient habits, these recommendations are designed to make a noticeable impact on your electricity expenses while keeping your home cool and comfortable.Let's delve into these actionable tips that can help you save money and energy throughout the summer season.The Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) issues BEE Star Labels as a voluntary method for manufacturers to indicate an appliance's energy efficiency. The label uses stars to indicate the efficiency of a product, with more stars indicating higher efficiency. Simply put, the higher the energy efficiency rating of the appliance, the lower its energy consumption. To effectively reduce your home's energy costs, opt for appliances with a 5-star BEE rating. Not only does this positively impact the environment, but it also helps lower your electricity bills. Explore Crompton's wide range of 5-star rated ceiling fans to learn more about BEE Rating Appliances.If your home still uses CFLs and incandescent bulbs, it's time to replace them with LED bulbs. LED bulbs are not just a trendy choice; they are recognized for their energy efficiency and superior illumination. If you're wondering how to reduce your electricity bill at home, switching to LED bulbs is the solution for you.Upgrading to smart appliances is a highly effective method to decrease electricity consumption at home. These devices allow you to automate tasks and manage energy usage efficiently. Consider installing energy-efficient ceiling fans to further reduce electricity consumption. Smart appliances typically come equipped with remote control capabilities, allowing you to schedule operations and conserve power. Crompton offers remote-controlled fans designed for enhanced energy savings and lower power consumption.These energy-efficient fans are gaining popularity due to their brushless direct current motors (BLDC), which operate on direct current electricity. They can help save up to 60% on electricity compared to normal induction motor-based fans. Additionally, they offer convenient features like remote control for turning the fan on and off, timer functionality, and compatibility with voice assistants. To learn more about the differences between BLDC fans and normal fans and how they can help reduce electricity bills, explore further information on BLDC fans versus conventional fans.Implementing a full solar power system for your home can be a substantial investment. However, there are more accessible and cost-effective ways to leverage solar energy. Installing outdoor solar lights in your balcony and garden, along with solar fans, can notably reduce your energy expenses at a modest cost. Additionally, using solar pumps for daily tasks can contribute to electricity savings. It's beneficial to understand the distinction between an electric geyser and a solar geyser to make an informed choice for your energy needs.Maintain your air conditioner at 24 degrees Celsius to optimise cooling and conserve energy during the summer months, effectively lowering electricity costs. Additionally, using a timer to automate AC operation and upgrading to a 5-star BEE-rated model can further enhance energy efficiency and reduce expenses associated with cooling your space.Numerous advanced smart energy metres are currently offered in the market. These metres typically use Wi-Fi connectivity to monitor overall power usage within a home and provide real-time analysis of consumption patterns. Additionally, they can detect power leaks and identify high-energy-consuming appliances. Wi-Fi LED bulbs represent an excellent choice for reducing electricity usage.Regularly servicing and maintaining your home appliances is essential for optimal functionality and efficiency. Appliances that are not properly maintained are known to consume excessive energy, so routine maintenance can prolong their lifespan and reduce energy consumption. Learn more about the importance of cleaning exhaust fans.Install a power strip if you have several electronic devices or appliances that need to be plugged into a single electrical outlet. This allows you to easily turn off all devices at once when they are not in use, preventing unnecessary energy consumption often referred to as ""phantom"" energy loss.One of the simplest and most effective methods to lower electricity costs is by turning off electrical devices such as lights, fans, and air conditioners when they are not in use.","During summer months, many households experience a significant increase in electricity consumption due to higher cooling needs.
