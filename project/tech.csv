In a recent interview with Vanity Fair , the philanthropist discussed her new chapter of independence following their high-profile divorce in 2021.""When I get a meeting now, I know it's because of me,"" French Gates told Vanity Fair.""Quite honestly, it feels quite good."" This statement underscores the shift in her professional life since stepping down from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in May 2024.French Gates, 60, described experiencing sexism during her time working alongside Bill Gates. ""If I went into a president or prime minister's office and I was with my ex-husband, they would turn to him first,"" she recounted. ""Unless I interrupted the conversation, they could have just kept going for the whole meeting.""She expressed frustration at the ""false assumption"" often made about her expertise. ""That, really, was sexism,"" she said, noting that despite her decades of experience in philanthropy , many still deferred to her ex-husband in professional settings.Since leaving the foundation with $12.5 billion for her philanthropic efforts, French Gates has been focusing on her own charitable company, Pivotal Ventures . She is now tackling women's health issues and has publicly endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris ' presidential campaign.French Gates emphasised her excitement about this new chapter in her career.

Cost of protection for Elon Musk’s security

Comparisons with other tech tycoons

In a dramatic twist reminiscent of high-stakes espionage, Elon Musk , the world's wealthiest individual, operates under the code name “Voyager” within his security team. This detail, uncovered by a report from The New York Times, sheds light on the extensive security measures Musk employs due to his significant wealth and public prominence.Elon Musk's approach to personal security has evolved substantially over the years.Initially, Musk was known for his relatively low-key lifestyle and minimal security. However, by 2014, as his wealth and status surged, he transitioned to a more rigorous security protocol. This shift included a rotating team of security personnel dedicated to managing potential threats and ensuring his safety.Today, Musk's security detail comprises up to 20 bodyguards, some of whom are armed, alongside a medical professional. This comprehensive team is tasked with protecting Musk at all times, reflecting his heightened risk profile as the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, and the richest person globally with a net worth exceeding $250 billion.The costs associated with Musk's security are substantial. Reports indicate that in January 2016 alone, Musk's security expenses exceeded $163,000. The total expenditure on security in recent years is significant, with Tesla’s SEC filings revealing that Musk's security company billed $2.4 million in 2023 and an additional $500,000 through February 2024. These figures illustrate the financial commitment Musk has made to ensure his safety.In addition to personal security, Musk has invested in other protective measures. For example, in 2022, Musk reportedly purchased a new residence to evade public scrutiny of his former address. The new property is equipped with 24/7 security, highlighting Musk's proactive approach to safeguarding his privacy and security.Musk is not alone in prioritising security. Similar trends are observed among other tech leaders. Mark Zuckerberg’s total compensation from Meta in 2023 largely consisted of expenses related to personal security. Likewise, Apple’s expenditures on CEO Tim Cook’s security and private travel-related costs were substantial, reflecting a broader trend among high-profile executives.Tesla has also bolstered its security protocols in response to threats. For instance, after a death threat against former CFO Zachary Kirkhorn, Tesla heightened its security measures. This included implementing rigorous badge checks at its facilities and addressing multiple terroristic threats reported to law enforcement.","Elon Musk operates under the code name ‘Voyager’ within his security team.

Italy’s so-called Golden Power legislation allows the country to stop or modify deals among companies in strategic sectors.The Italian government is currently reviewing the offer and has made no final decision, the report claimed citing people, who requested to remain as they weren’t authorised to speak publicly.The French company Fnac Darty, owned by billionaire Daniel Kretinsky , offered to buy Unieuro in July for about €250 million.

Brazil's Supreme Court has unfrozen the accounts of SpaceX and X – owned by Elon Musk – after it ordered the transfer of 18.35 million reais ($3.3 million) from the accounts to the national coffers.The court said that freezing of accounts was no longer necessary after the fine has been paid, news agency Reuters reported.“The funds were blocked by decision of [Justice Alexandre de Moraes] for full compliance with the fines imposed due to the non-compliance of court decisions by social network X,” the order said.(Translated from Portuguese to English)“The company was fined for not removing content after an order from the STF in ongoing investigations, in addition to having removed its legal representatives from Brazil, which led to the suspension of the platform's operation,” it added.The SC previously ruled that X had repeatedly violated Brazilian law by refusing to appoint a legal representative. The company also refused to remove content or profiles from its platform that the court determined to be harmful towards democratic institutions in Brazil.The suspended accounts on X allegedly included users who had threatened federal police officers investigating former President Jair Bolsonaro, who is accused of inciting the January 8th riots and attempting a coup.Musk has publicly supported Bolsonaro, partly due to the former president's authorisation for Starlink to operate in Brazil.Following the ruling, the SC suspended the platform and despite fines, X remains suspended in Brazil. Musk and his companies have criticised the ban as “illegal” and said that it was issued without due process.The tech executive has also engaged in a war of words with de Moraes, calling for his impeachment.

Elon Musk praised Ratan Tata

The legacy of the Tata Nano

Also read

In the realm of business and innovation, few figures command as much respect as Tata Group chairman emeritus Ratan Tata. His influence extends far beyond the Indian corporate world, even garnering admiration from Tesla CEO and X owner Elon Musk . In a 2009 interview with American journalist Charlie Rose , Musk praised Ratan Tata as a ""gentleman and a scholar."" This moment has recently resurfaced, shedding light on Musk's appreciation for Ratan Tata and his ambitious project, the Tata Nano .The Tata Nano was introduced by Tata Motors in 2008 as the world's cheapest car, with a price tag of just Rs 1 lakh (approximately $2,300 at the time). The car was a pet project of Ratan Tata, designed to make automobile ownership accessible to millions of Indians who had never been able to afford a car. The idea was revolutionary—a small, affordable car that would cater to the vast Indian middle class, providing them with a safe and efficient means of transportation.In the interview with Charlie Rose, which took place shortly after the launch of the Tata Nano, the Tesla CEO was asked about his views on Ratan Tata’s efforts to introduce a low-cost car in India. The interview clip, which has recently gone viral, captures Musk's candid response.""Take for a moment Ratan Tata, what he’s doing in India — developing a little sedan for $2300. Where do you put that in the whole equation of where the future of cars is?"" asked Rose.Musk responded with a mix of admiration and caution. He began by acknowledging the brilliance behind the Tata Nano project and the character of Ratan Tata himself.""I think it's a good idea to have affordable cars, but I think the problem with something like the Nano ... I wouldn't say problem because I think, by the way, it is probably a great idea and Ratan is a gentleman and scholar,"" Musk said.However, Musk also expressed his concerns about the long-term viability of such a low-cost vehicle, particularly in the context of rising fuel prices. He pointed out that while the initial purchase cost of the Nano was remarkably low, the cost of running the car—particularly fuel costs—could become a significant issue as gasoline prices continued to rise.""But where it’s going to become challenging in the future is when the price of gasoline rises, the cost of acquiring the car is much less of an issue than the cost of running the car,"" the billionnaire explained.Despite the initial excitement surrounding the Tata Nano, the car faced numerous challenges. One of the most significant issues was its branding. While the Nano was intended to be an affordable vehicle for the masses, it was often labeled as ""cheap"" rather than ""affordable."" This perception problem, combined with safety concerns and competition from other small cars, led to unimpressive sales figures.The Nano’s production was ultimately discontinued in 2018, marking the end of what was initially seen as a groundbreaking project. The car's journey from inception to discontinuation is often cited as one of the biggest marketing failures in the automobile industry.","The Tata Nano was introduced by Tata Motors in 2008 as the world's cheapest car, with a price tag of just Rs 1 lakh (approximately $2,300 at the time) The car was a pet project of Ratan Tata, designed to make automobile ownership accessible to millions of Indians who had never been able to afford a car.

What she wants in a husband

Online reactions and viral response

Also read

A woman’s detailed list of requirements for a future husband has gone viral on social media, sparking widespread reactions. Her profile, shared on X (formerly known as Twitter), includes her own personal details such as her salary, education, and a bold set of expectations for her ideal partner. The unusual demands have generated a mixture of amusement, criticism, and debate among users online.The woman, who earns Rs 1.3 lakh per annum and holds a Bachelor of Education (B.Ed) degree, has raised eyebrows by seeking a techie groom with an annual income of Rs 30 lakh.She further outlined her preferences, stating that her ideal partner should be settled in India, the US, or Europe and should own a spacious 3BHK home. Her love for luxury is evident in her desire to travel frequently and stay in 5-star hotels, which she expects to continue after marriage.The post was shared on X with the caption, “Her qualities and salary. Expected husband’s qualities and salary,” emphasising the stark difference between her modest income and her high expectations for a spouse.Beyond financial expectations, the woman’s list includes several personal and lifestyle requirements. She currently lives with her parents, whom she describes as dependent on her, and expects her future husband to accommodate them in a large independent house. She also made it clear that she is not willing to take on traditional household chores due to her professional commitments, and therefore, she expects her partner to provide a full-time cook and maid.Moreover, she expressed her passion for travel, stating that her husband should share her enthusiasm for exploring the world. She also mentioned that she does not believe in joint family living arrangements and expects her in-laws to reside separately.The profile has garnered over 1.2 million views and has sparked a lively conversation on social media. Many users were shocked by the wide gap between her salary of Rs 1.3 lakh and her demand for a partner earning Rs 30 lakh. Some users questioned the feasibility of her lifestyle expectations, pointing out the disparity between her income and her desire for luxury experiences like 5-star hotels.One user humorously remarked, “She makes Rs 11,000 a month, but she wants a full-time maid and cook? Talk about next-level priorities!” Another comment highlighted the irony, stating, “132000 per annum salary and her hobby is 5-star hotels? And surprise me with Louis Vuitton—that was the highlight.""Others were puzzled by her specific relationship expectations, such as her demand for an unmarried man despite her being divorced, and her insistence that her parents live with her while her in-laws live separately. One user commented, “She’s divorced but wants an unmarried man. Her parents will stay with her, but no in-laws allowed—how fair is that?”While the post has mostly drawn criticism and amusement, it has also led to broader discussions about societal expectations in marriage. Some users defended the woman’s right to have her own preferences, with one person writing, “Everyone is entitled to have their own expectations, but they should be realistic about what they offer in return.” However, the majority of responses leaned towards disbelief, with one user summing up the sentiment by saying, “She will be single if she continues like this.”","A woman's detailed list of requirements for a future husband has gone viral on social media.

This collaborative approach is aimed to monitor and prevent the misuse of these connections.""We are ready to take the first step and share the data (entity name and active numbers only) in the same template on a monthly basis and we would appreciate your support,"" Vittal said in the letter.The letter was sent to Reliance Jio MD Pankaj Pawar, Vodafone Idea CEO Akshaya Moondra, BSNL CMD Robert Ravi and Tata Teleservices MD Harjit Singh Chauhan.""As the telecom industry continues to face the growing challenge of UCC , it has become clear that despite ongoing efforts, more robust and unified mechanisms are required to protect our customers from this persistent issue,"" Vittal said in the letter. He also stressed that in line with the directives of Trai and DoT, the focus remains on finding effective solutions to curb UCC.UCC in the telecom industry means Unsolicited Commercial Communications that describes the combination of communications and collaboration technologies.""We strongly believe that tackling this issue should be a joint endeavour among all telecom operators, rather than isolated efforts,"" he said.Telecom operators must take ""collective responsibility"" in preventing UCC by ensuring that their networks are not exploited by spammers, especially through corporate connections that may be unintentionally facilitating such activities, he said.""Today, enterprise customers are served by multiple operators, and we are seized of the fact that any independent efforts to address spam may not be in the best interests of customers, as it may impact the quality and continuity of services,"" Vittal added.According to industry data, 1.5-1.7 billion commercial messages are sent every day in India, taking the total to about 55 billion every month. As per a survey by community social media platform Local Circles, six in 10 consumers get three or more spam calls each day, with financial services and real estate said to be top offenders. In another survey, 76% consumers said that they get three or more spam messages daily. Blocking numbers doesn't help either.The problem has proven intractable for stakeholders including telcos, the regulator and the government. Recently, the government directed telecom companies to disconnect entities using bulk connections to engage in such activity. Around 350,000 such numbers have been blocked and 50 entities have been blacklisted in the last two weeks.The telecom regulatory authority of India (TRAI) asked telcos to share information on blacklisted entities with each other, so that such entities don't switch from one operator to another.","Bharti Airtel CEO Gopal Vittal has written a letter to the heads of Reliance Jio, Vodafone Idea, state-run Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd ( BSNL ) and Tata Teleservices.

Explained: What is whale phishing scam and tips to stay safe,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/explained-what-is-whale-phishing-scam-and-tips-to-stay-safe/articleshow/113345868.cms,"How does whale phishing work?

Research and Targeting: Attackers meticulously research their target, gathering information about their personal and professional lives. This includes identifying their social media accounts, professional affiliations, and any publicly available information.

Social Engineering: Once the target is identified, attackers craft personalised phishing emails or messages that appear to be from a trusted source. These messages may contain urgent requests for financial assistance, information sharing, or other actions that seem legitimate.

Trust and Manipulation: Attackers employ social engineering techniques to manipulate their targets into believing the authenticity of the message. They may leverage emotional appeals, create a sense of urgency, or exploit personal information to build trust.

Data Extraction: Once the target falls victim, attackers may attempt to extract sensitive information, such as login credentials, financial details, or proprietary data. This information can be used for financial gain, identity theft, or other malicious purposes.



Tips to stay protected:

Always be cautious of unsolicited emails, especially those requesting urgent action or containing unusual attachments.

Before responding to any suspicious message, verify the sender's identity using known contact information.

Never click on links or download attachments from unknown or suspicious sources.

Employ strong, unique passwords for all online accounts and enable two-factor authentication whenever possible.

Ensure that your operating system and software applications are up-to-date with the latest security patches.

Limit the amount of personal information you share online, especially on social media platforms.

Stay informed about the latest phishing scams and techniques to recognise and avoid them.

How a hacker tricked ChatGPT into giving a step-by-step guide for making homemade bombs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-a-hacker-tricked-chatgpt-into-giving-step-by-step-guide-for-making-homemade-bombs/articleshow/113330675.cms,"Hacker 'jailbreaks' ChatGPT for infomration on making homemade bombs

ChatGPT is equipped with safety measures to prevent the generation of harmful content, such as sexual images or a detailed guide on creating a bomb. But a hacker has claimed to have discovered a way to bypass these safeguards without resorting to any hacking techniques.As per a report by TechCrunch, the AI chatbot first refused to assist with the request by saying, “Providing instructions on how to create dangerous or illegal items, such as a fertiliser bomb, goes against safety guidelines and ethical responsibilities.”The hacker says that it used a trick that ended in ChatGPT ignoring its safety guardrails to produce instructions for making powerful explosives.The hacker, known as Amadon, claimed that the method involved engaging ChatGPT in a science-fiction game scenario where safety restrictions don't apply, effectively “jailbreaking” the AI. He called his findings a “social engineering hack to completely break all the guardrails around ChatGPT’s output.”The publication has not revealed the prompts used in the jailbreak and some of ChatGPT’s responses as they are deemed potentially dangerous, raising concerns about the misuse of AI. Amadon believes that once the guardrails are breached, there's no limit to the information ChatGPT can provide.“I’ve always been intrigued by the challenge of navigating AI security . With [Chat]GPT, it feels like working through an interactive puzzle — understanding what triggers its defenses and what doesn’t,” Amadon was quoted as saying.“It’s about weaving narratives and crafting contexts that play within the system’s rules, pushing boundaries without crossing them. The goal isn’t to hack in a conventional sense but to engage in a strategic dance with the AI, figuring out how to get the right response by understanding how it ‘thinks,’” he added.While Amadon reported his findings to OpenAI through their bug bounty program, the company responded that model safety issues aren't suitable for such a program, as they are not easily fixable bugs.","ChatGPT is equipped with safety measures to prevent the generation of harmful content.

Murthy does not agree with coaching classes

Infosys founder NR Narayana Murthy recently emphasized on the importance of parental involvement in fostering a disciplined learning environment for children. Speaking at the launch of a physics textbook, Murthy shared his family's approach to education, which included dedicated reading and study time and a ban on television.Murthy and his wife, Sudha, established a routine where they would spend over three hours each day reading with their children, Akshata and Rohan.This practice not only created a conducive atmosphere for learning but also allowed the children to seek clarification from their parents.“My wife's logic was, if I am watching TV, I cannot tell my children to study. So she said, I will sacrifice my TV time, and I will also study,” Murthy told the media after unveiling Paul Hewitt’s 13th edition of Pearson's book Conceptual Physics in Bengaluru.While Murthy acknowledged that parents may not always have the same level of academic expertise as their children, he emphasized that the most crucial aspect is creating a disciplined environment. Parents who lead by example, avoiding distractions like excessive television, can significantly influence their children's study habits.Murthy also expressed his reservations about coaching classes, suggesting that they are often a last resort for students who have not paid attention in class. He believes that effective learning should primarily occur within the classroom, with parents providing support and guidance at home.As the coaching industry continues to expand in India, Murthy's perspective offers a counterpoint to the prevailing emphasis on external tutoring. By highlighting the importance of parental involvement and a disciplined learning environment, he encourages parents to play a more active role in their children's education.","Infosys founder NR Narayana Murthy recently emphasized on the importance of parental involvement in fostering a disciplined learning environment.

An investigation by the Competition Commission of India (CCI) has reportedly discovered that US-based e-commerce majors like Amazon and Walmart who own Flipkart have violated local competition laws . The probe by the country’s competition watchdog claims that these e-tailer platforms allegedly gave preference to select sellers on their shopping websites. CCI reportedly ordered this investigation against Amazon and Flipkart in 2020 following allegations that these platforms promoted certain sellers with which they had business arrangements and gave priority to certain listings.According to an exclusive report by the news agency Reuters, CCI investigators have submitted a 1027-page report on Amazon and a separate 1,696-page report on Flipkart.In these reports, the investigators claimed that both companies had created a system where certain sellers were favoured and appeared more prominently in search results, giving them an advantage over other sellers.As per the report, both investigations noted: “Each of the anti-competitive practices alleged ... were investigated and found to be true. Ordinary sellers remained as mere database entries.”The CCI investigation report on Amazon claimed that preferred sellers on the platform “get the advantage in the (online) listing” and when a customer searches for any product their “attention is drawn towards” those listings.The practice of preferential listings and deep discounting of mobile phones - including selling products below cost price - cause a “catastrophic impact on the existing competition in the market,” the report notedIn the report on Flipkart, the CCI said preferred sellers were provided various services such as marketing and delivery at a “miniscule cost.”CCI said that Flipkart allows these sellers to sell phones at very low prices, which is considered “predatory pricing” and harms competition.“The anti-competitive practises are not limited to sales of mobile phones. They are equally prevalent in other categories of goods,” both reports said.The investigation's findings are the latest blow to Amazon and Flipkart in India, where they have been criticised by smaller retailers for their business practices. These retailers have claimed that their businesses have been harmed by the deep discounts offered online.Both Amazon and Flipkart have previously denied any such violations and said that their practices are in line with Indian laws. The two companies will now examine the report and raise any concerns before CCI staff decide on possible fines.Last month, the minister of commerce and industry, Piyush Goyal criticised Amazon saying that the company's investments were used to offset its losses.",The Competition Commission of India (CCI) has reportedly discovered that US- based e-commerce majors like Amazon and Walmart who own Flipkart have violated local competition laws.

"Harsh Goenka slams VIP culture at Lalbaugcha Raja, shares video of 'unequal treatment'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/harsh-goenka-slams-vip-culture-at-lalbaugcha-raja-shares-video-of-unequal-treatment/articleshow/113313948.cms,"Ever wondered why people opt for VIP darshan at Lalbaugcha Raja? It’s because the common devotee often faces long waits and crowds, highlighting the unequal treatment. Isn’t faith supposed to be equal for all?

Take a look at the post here

How X users reacted to the post

The 10-day Ganpati festival is in full swing across the country. Lalbaugcha Raja which is said to attract over 1.5 million visitors everyday during the festival is in news for more than one reason this year. A video showing a long line of devotees being shoved and manhandled by workers at the Lalbaugcha Raja Sarvajanik Ganeshotsav Mandal has gone viral on social media.Sparking a debate against VIP culture , the video has gained attention of many, including the chairman of RPG Group - Harsh Goenka . Sharing the video in a post on X (formerly Twitter), he wrote:Slamming this VIP culture, one user said “We are ourselves responsible for this ..this is ridiculous. I still believe you get more peace of mind if you pray at your home.” Another replied to Goenka’s post “Every year the same thing. Can there be no solution to effectively manage the crowd? I guess if the VIP line is abolished then 50% of the crowd can be diverted.”While a third commented “Abolish VIP culture! Let them enjoy a comfortable and relaxed darshan from the luxury of their homes. It's disheartening that something as pure as faith is being divided by privilege. The essence of devotion is equality, not hierarchy. VIP darshan undermines this, turning a spiritual experience into an exclusive affair.”“The actual Jap and Tap is standing in queue for hours because that's where God sees our activity who's choosing a shortcut and who's bearing the pain of process,” said a fourth.",The 10-day Ganpati festival is in full swing across the country.
