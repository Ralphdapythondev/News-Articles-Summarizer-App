"TRAI excludes Google, WhatsApp, Telegram and others from new licensing rules",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/trai-excludes-google-whatsapp-telegram-and-others-from-new-licensing-rules/articleshow/113468560.cms,"What are TRAI's proposals related to satellite-based services

What telecom operators told TRAI

The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India ( TRAI ) has proposed new recommendations aimed at simplifying the licensing process under Telecom Act. Importantly, the regulatory body has excluded Over-The-Top (OTT) services like WhatsApp Google ’s RCS, Telegram and other such platforms under this licensing regime.The new recommendations advocate for a single, unified authorisation system across different services and regions - a “One Nation One Authorization” framework.As per TRAI recommendation, any entity that holds this authorisation can provide mobile service, internet service, broadband service, landline telephone service, long distance service, satellite communication service, Machine to Machine (M2M) and internet of Things (IoT) service on a pan India basis.Furthermore, TRAI's proposals include enabling satellite-based services to offer voice calling and messaging features, broadening the spectrum of services available within the telecom sector. The regulatory body also advocates for the shared utilisation of both active and passive infrastructure amongst service providers – which can potentially result in greater efficiency and a decrease in operational expenses.Additionally, in a move to ease the financial strain on telecom operators, TRAI has suggested the gradual elimination of entry fees during the process of authorization renewal.The exclusion comes despite pressure from telecom companies like Reliance Jio , Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea that wanted these platforms to be regulated in a simialr fashion as the traditional telecom services.According to a report by Economic Times last month, the telcos asked TRAI to create licences or permissions for OTT (over-the-top) communication apps, arguing that they provide similar services to what mobile phone operators offer.Meanwhile, OTT apps opposed this, claiming that they are already regulated under the Information Technology Act.","TRAI has proposed new recommendations aimed at simplifying the licensing process under Telecom Act.

The platform is introducing a new feature that allows creators to break their videos into seasons and episodes, similar to the format used by Netflix and other streaming services.This new formatting will make it easier for viewers to navigate and find specific content within a channel.It's a significant step for YouTube as it continues to expand its presence in the living room, where YouTuber revenue on TVs has increased by 30% year over year.Although YouTube hasn't provided details on how the new formatting will appear on desktop and mobile devices, it's expected to be available across all platforms. In addition to the season and episode feature, creators will also have access to other TV-focused tools, such as the ability to add immersive content that plays directly on their channel page.Previously, some YouTubers had created seasons and episodes for their shows by using playlists and numbered naming conventions. However, this method often resulted in a less user-friendly experience on TV platforms like Apple TV and Roku. The new YouTube feature aims to streamline this process and provide a more seamless viewing experience for viewers.","YouTube is making it easier for creators to organise their content and for viewers to binge-watch their favorite shows on TV.

ccenture Plc is reportedly planning to push back the bulk of its staff promotions by six months in the latest sign of a prolonged slump that’s hurt the wider consultancy industry. According to a report in Bloomberg, the Dublin-based technology giant told employees in an internal blog post last week that it will announce most promotions in June, rather than in the usual month of December.The technology giant has over 750,000 employees globally.The blog reportedly cites ongoing economic uncertainties within the consulting industry . This decision comes as a result of decreased client spending and a broader downturn in the professional services sector. Accenture 's revenue forecast for fiscal 2024 was lowered earlier this year, reflecting the challenges posed by the current economic climate.In October 2023, Accenture had communicated to its employees in India and Sri Lanka that they will not receive hikes for the fiscal year 2023 following adverse macroeconomic challenges. In an email sent out by the country, managing director Ajay Vij said that employees will get individual annual performance bonuses where applicable although they will be significantly lower than the previous year due to the company's performance setback.The company also reportedly postponed promotions across senior management until June 2024. “Given the context of our performance, we will not be providing any stay-at-level (base pay) increases this year except where legally mandated or committed in a few critical skill areas,” he added.Similar measures are also said to have been adopted by other consulting firms, including McKinsey & Co., Ernst & Young, and PricewaterhouseCoopers, as they navigate the slowdown. While there has been a recent surge in demand for AI and automation-related projects, it has not been sufficient to offset the overall economic pressures.","Dublin-based technology giant told employees in an internal blog post last week that it will announce most promotions in June, rather than in the usual month of December.

51 arrests made from 4 countries

An international operation involving law enforcement agencies from 9 different countries has led to the dismantling of an encrypted communication platform which was used by online criminals for organised crime on a global scale.According to the information provided by Europol – the law enforcement agency of the European Union – the platform is known as Ghost and it helped criminals “in large-scale drug trafficking , money laundering , instances of extreme violence and other forms of serious and organised crime.”Ghost is a communication platform that gained traction among criminal organisations due to its advanced security features.“Users could purchase the tool without declaring any personal information. The solution used three encryption standards and offered the option to send a message followed by a specific code which would result in the self-destruction of all messages on the target phone,” Europol saidAs per the agency, this tool allowed criminal networks to “communicate securely, evade detection, counter forensic measures, and coordinate their illegal operations across borders.”It added that the tool was being used by several thousand people globally and around one thousand messages were being exchanged each day via Ghost.Europol says that servers were found in France and Iceland, while the company owners were located in Australia. The financial assets were located in the US. The agencies conducted a series of coordinated raids.“Over the course of the investigation, 51 suspects have been arrested: 38 in Australia, 11 in Ireland, one in Canada and one in Italy belonging to the Italian Sacra Corona Unita mafia group,” it added.Further arrests and disruption of illegal activities are anticipated as the investigation progresses.","An international operation involving law enforcement agencies from 9 different countries has led to the dismantling of an encrypted communication platform.

Elon Musk praised Ratan Tata

The legacy of the Tata Nano

Also read

In the realm of business and innovation, few figures command as much respect as Tata Group chairman emeritus Ratan Tata. His influence extends far beyond the Indian corporate world, even garnering admiration from Tesla CEO and X owner Elon Musk . In a 2009 interview with American journalist Charlie Rose , Musk praised Ratan Tata as a ""gentleman and a scholar."" This moment has recently resurfaced, shedding light on Musk's appreciation for Ratan Tata and his ambitious project, the Tata Nano .The Tata Nano was introduced by Tata Motors in 2008 as the world's cheapest car, with a price tag of just Rs 1 lakh (approximately $2,300 at the time). The car was a pet project of Ratan Tata, designed to make automobile ownership accessible to millions of Indians who had never been able to afford a car. The idea was revolutionary—a small, affordable car that would cater to the vast Indian middle class, providing them with a safe and efficient means of transportation.In the interview with Charlie Rose, which took place shortly after the launch of the Tata Nano, the Tesla CEO was asked about his views on Ratan Tata’s efforts to introduce a low-cost car in India. The interview clip, which has recently gone viral, captures Musk's candid response.""Take for a moment Ratan Tata, what he’s doing in India — developing a little sedan for $2300. Where do you put that in the whole equation of where the future of cars is?"" asked Rose.Musk responded with a mix of admiration and caution. He began by acknowledging the brilliance behind the Tata Nano project and the character of Ratan Tata himself.""I think it's a good idea to have affordable cars, but I think the problem with something like the Nano ... I wouldn't say problem because I think, by the way, it is probably a great idea and Ratan is a gentleman and scholar,"" Musk said.However, Musk also expressed his concerns about the long-term viability of such a low-cost vehicle, particularly in the context of rising fuel prices. He pointed out that while the initial purchase cost of the Nano was remarkably low, the cost of running the car—particularly fuel costs—could become a significant issue as gasoline prices continued to rise.""But where it’s going to become challenging in the future is when the price of gasoline rises, the cost of acquiring the car is much less of an issue than the cost of running the car,"" the billionnaire explained.Despite the initial excitement surrounding the Tata Nano, the car faced numerous challenges. One of the most significant issues was its branding. While the Nano was intended to be an affordable vehicle for the masses, it was often labeled as ""cheap"" rather than ""affordable."" This perception problem, combined with safety concerns and competition from other small cars, led to unimpressive sales figures.The Nano’s production was ultimately discontinued in 2018, marking the end of what was initially seen as a groundbreaking project. The car's journey from inception to discontinuation is often cited as one of the biggest marketing failures in the automobile industry.","The Tata Nano was introduced by Tata Motors in 2008 as the world's cheapest car, with a price tag of just Rs 1 lakh (approximately $2,300 at the time) The car was a pet project of Ratan Tata, designed to make automobile ownership accessible to millions of Indians who had never been able to afford a car.

What she wants in a husband

Online reactions and viral response

Also read

A woman’s detailed list of requirements for a future husband has gone viral on social media, sparking widespread reactions. Her profile, shared on X (formerly known as Twitter), includes her own personal details such as her salary, education, and a bold set of expectations for her ideal partner. The unusual demands have generated a mixture of amusement, criticism, and debate among users online.The woman, who earns Rs 1.3 lakh per annum and holds a Bachelor of Education (B.Ed) degree, has raised eyebrows by seeking a techie groom with an annual income of Rs 30 lakh.She further outlined her preferences, stating that her ideal partner should be settled in India, the US, or Europe and should own a spacious 3BHK home. Her love for luxury is evident in her desire to travel frequently and stay in 5-star hotels, which she expects to continue after marriage.The post was shared on X with the caption, “Her qualities and salary. Expected husband’s qualities and salary,” emphasising the stark difference between her modest income and her high expectations for a spouse.Beyond financial expectations, the woman’s list includes several personal and lifestyle requirements. She currently lives with her parents, whom she describes as dependent on her, and expects her future husband to accommodate them in a large independent house. She also made it clear that she is not willing to take on traditional household chores due to her professional commitments, and therefore, she expects her partner to provide a full-time cook and maid.Moreover, she expressed her passion for travel, stating that her husband should share her enthusiasm for exploring the world. She also mentioned that she does not believe in joint family living arrangements and expects her in-laws to reside separately.The profile has garnered over 1.2 million views and has sparked a lively conversation on social media. Many users were shocked by the wide gap between her salary of Rs 1.3 lakh and her demand for a partner earning Rs 30 lakh. Some users questioned the feasibility of her lifestyle expectations, pointing out the disparity between her income and her desire for luxury experiences like 5-star hotels.One user humorously remarked, “She makes Rs 11,000 a month, but she wants a full-time maid and cook? Talk about next-level priorities!” Another comment highlighted the irony, stating, “132000 per annum salary and her hobby is 5-star hotels? And surprise me with Louis Vuitton—that was the highlight.""Others were puzzled by her specific relationship expectations, such as her demand for an unmarried man despite her being divorced, and her insistence that her parents live with her while her in-laws live separately. One user commented, “She’s divorced but wants an unmarried man. Her parents will stay with her, but no in-laws allowed—how fair is that?”While the post has mostly drawn criticism and amusement, it has also led to broader discussions about societal expectations in marriage. Some users defended the woman’s right to have her own preferences, with one person writing, “Everyone is entitled to have their own expectations, but they should be realistic about what they offer in return.” However, the majority of responses leaned towards disbelief, with one user summing up the sentiment by saying, “She will be single if she continues like this.”","A woman's detailed list of requirements for a future husband has gone viral on social media.

This collaborative approach is aimed to monitor and prevent the misuse of these connections.""We are ready to take the first step and share the data (entity name and active numbers only) in the same template on a monthly basis and we would appreciate your support,"" Vittal said in the letter.The letter was sent to Reliance Jio MD Pankaj Pawar, Vodafone Idea CEO Akshaya Moondra, BSNL CMD Robert Ravi and Tata Teleservices MD Harjit Singh Chauhan.""As the telecom industry continues to face the growing challenge of UCC , it has become clear that despite ongoing efforts, more robust and unified mechanisms are required to protect our customers from this persistent issue,"" Vittal said in the letter. He also stressed that in line with the directives of Trai and DoT, the focus remains on finding effective solutions to curb UCC.UCC in the telecom industry means Unsolicited Commercial Communications that describes the combination of communications and collaboration technologies.""We strongly believe that tackling this issue should be a joint endeavour among all telecom operators, rather than isolated efforts,"" he said.Telecom operators must take ""collective responsibility"" in preventing UCC by ensuring that their networks are not exploited by spammers, especially through corporate connections that may be unintentionally facilitating such activities, he said.""Today, enterprise customers are served by multiple operators, and we are seized of the fact that any independent efforts to address spam may not be in the best interests of customers, as it may impact the quality and continuity of services,"" Vittal added.According to industry data, 1.5-1.7 billion commercial messages are sent every day in India, taking the total to about 55 billion every month. As per a survey by community social media platform Local Circles, six in 10 consumers get three or more spam calls each day, with financial services and real estate said to be top offenders. In another survey, 76% consumers said that they get three or more spam messages daily. Blocking numbers doesn't help either.The problem has proven intractable for stakeholders including telcos, the regulator and the government. Recently, the government directed telecom companies to disconnect entities using bulk connections to engage in such activity. Around 350,000 such numbers have been blocked and 50 entities have been blacklisted in the last two weeks.The telecom regulatory authority of India (TRAI) asked telcos to share information on blacklisted entities with each other, so that such entities don't switch from one operator to another.","Bharti Airtel CEO Gopal Vittal has written a letter to the heads of Reliance Jio, Vodafone Idea, state-run Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd ( BSNL ) and Tata Teleservices.

EU court reduces Qualcomm's antitrust fine but why the US chipmaker is penalised,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/eu-court-reduces-qualcomms-antitrust-fine-but-why-the-us-chipmaker-is-penalised/articleshow/113463963.cms,"Why Qualcomm was fined in 2019

Google wins challenge in 1.49 billion euro antitrust case

Qualcomm’s attempt to overturn a European Union (EU) antitrust fine has been unsuccessful. Europe's second-top court has largely rejected the technology company's arguments in a 2019 case concerning mobile chipsets. The European Union's General Court said that the fine against Qualcomm will stand, with a minor adjustment.The ruling means that Qualcomm will still be required to pay a 238.7 million euros ($265.5 million) penalty – which has been slightly reduced from the initial 242 million euros ($269 million) fine.The Court made “a detailed examination of all the pleas put forward by Qualcomm, rejecting them all in their entirety, with the exception of a plea concerning the calculation of the amount of the fine, which it finds to be well founded in part,” the court said.The European Commission imposed the fine on Qualcomm in 2019, saying that the chipmaker sold its chipsets below cost between 2009 and 2011. This practice, known as predatory pricing, is alleged to have been used to thwart British phone software maker Icera, which is now part of Nvidia Qualcomm contended that the 3G chipsets in question represented a negligible share – 0.7% of the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) market, making it impossible to shut out competitors. Qualcomm now has an option to appeal the ruling to the EU Court of Justice.Two years ago, Qualcomm successfully persuaded the same court to overturn a 997 million euro antitrust fine. The 2018 fine was imposed due to Qualcomm's payments to Apple, ensuring exclusive use of Qualcomm chips in iPhones and iPads, effectively blocking competitors like Intel.The development comes on the same day as Google won its challenge against a 1.49 billion euro ($1.66 billion) antitrust fine that was imposed on it for allegedly hindering rivals in online search advertising. In 2019, the European Commission alleged that Google abused its dominance to prevent rivals from placing search ads on third-party websites.","The European Union's General Court said that the fine against Qualcomm will stand, with a minor adjustment.

“The Blindsight device from Neuralink will enable even those who have lost both eyes and their optic nerve to see. Provided the visual cortex is intact, it will even enable those who have been blind from birth to see for the first time. To set expectations correctly, the vision will at first be low resolution, like Atari graphics, but eventually, it has the potential to be better than natural vision and enable you to see in infrared, ultraviolet or even radar wavelengths, like Geordi La Forge. Much appreciated @US_FDA!”

Elon Musk-owned brain-chip startup , Neuralink , has achieved a major milestone from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The public health agency has granted the company’s experimental vision implant the ""breakthrough device"" tag. This tag is awarded to medical devices that offer treatments or diagnoses for life-threatening conditions. The FDA aims to accelerate the development and review of such devices, and the breakthrough tag signifies the potential for significant benefits to patients.In a post shared on X, the startup wrote:Join us in our quest to bring back sight to those who have lost it. Apply to our Patient Registry and openings on our career page.”In a separate post, Musk said:However, Neuralink has yet to share details about when it expects the Blindsight device to move into human trials.Neuralink, founded by Elon Musk in 2016, is working on another technology that could restore vision and movement for specially-abled patients . The company's implant can be surgically placed within the skull to process and transmit neural signals which will enable communication with external devices like computers or phones.The company is also conducting research on another implant designed to help specially-abled patients control digital devices using only their thoughts. This technology holds potential for individuals with spinal cord injuries.A clinical trial is currently underway to evaluate the effectiveness of this implant. Three patients have already participated in the study, which is expected to last several years.Earlier this year, Neuralink successfully implanted the device in a second patient who has been using the implant to play video games and learn 3D design. This demonstrates the technology's potential to enhance the lives of those with special abilities.","The FDA has granted the company’s experimental vision implant the ""breakthrough device"" tag.

A Taiwanese pager manufacturer , Gold Apollo , has denied producing the devices used in deadly explosions in Lebanon on Tuesday, September 17. The company said that the pagers, which were used by Hezbollah members and caused the deaths of twelve people, as per latest reports, and injuries to thousands, were made by a licensee using its brand.The explosions, believed to have been triggered by explosives planted inside the pagers, were attributed to Israel's Mossad spy agency by Lebanese security sources.Gold Apollo founder and president, Hsu Ching-kuang , clarified that the company only licensed its brand to a European-based company, BAC, for sales in specific regions. The design and manufacturing of the pagers were entirely handled by BAC. Hsu reportedly told journalists that Gold Apollo has had a licensing agreement with BAC for the past three years. “According to the cooperation agreement, we authorize BAC to use our brand trademark for product sales in designated regions, but the design and manufacturing of the products are solely the responsibility of BAC,” the statement read.Hsu expressed concerns about irregularities in remittances from BAC, suggesting that payments may have been routed through the Middle East.

Benefits of a pager



Why pagers exploded in Lebanon

A series of explosion of pagers in Lebanon resulted in at least nine fatalities, injuring over 2,700. The blasts occurred on Tuesday (Sep 17) in Beirut's southern suburbs and other areas. In a statement, Hezbollah said that at 3:30 pm (1230 GMT) pagers used by people working for the group’s institutions began exploding “mysteriously.”A senior Lebanese security source claimed that Israel’s Mossad spy agency planted explosives inside these pagers or “beepers” that were ordered months before the blasts.Taiwan's Gold Apollo has refused that it did not make the pagers used in the detonations. Instead, they had been manufactured by a company called BAC which has a licence to use its brand, the company said.A pager is a radio-operated electronic device used for transmitting brief text messages. The device is usually designed to only receive messages, but in some cases can also be used to to send messages. When a pager beeps with a new message, the recipient needs to locate a nearby public or landline phone to respond to the message.Pagers were widely used in the pre-mobile era during the late 1990s. It was a critical communication tool for doctors, journalists and emergency health service providers.There are several types of pagers - numeric, alphanumeric and use case. A numeric pager, as the name suggests, can only display numbers. It is the simplest and easiest pager to use. Alphanumeric, on the other hand, can display both numbers and alphabets. While a use case pager is specially designed for quick alerts and contact information, particularly in professions that require immediate communication.One of the major benefits of using a pager or a beeper is the connectivity range. As a pager works on radio frequencies, it can provide network coverage in remote areas as well. Another benefit is that the pagers are difficult to track - a key reason why Hezabollah was using it. Since a pager is usually meant to only receive a message, it is difficult to trace.Also, compared to mobile phones, pagers offer longer battery life and durability. Also, they are straightforward to use, compared to a mobile phone.While the exact reason is not known yet, reports suggest that overheating of lithium batteries could be a possible reason behind the detonation. Commonly used in consumer electronics like mobile phones, laptops and electric vehicles, lithium batteries can burn at temperatures near or above 1,100 degrees Fahrenheit (590 degrees Celsius).A Hezbollah anonymously told news agency AP that the explosions were the result of a “security operation targeting the devices.” The official claimed that “the enemy (Israel) is behind this security incident.”","A series of explosion of pagers in Lebanon resulted in at least nine fatalities, injuring over 2,700.

26-year-old employee's mother writes letter to EY Chairman: Anna's death should serve as a wake up call for EY,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/26-year-old-employees-mother-writes-letter-to-ey-chairman-annas-death-should-serve-as-a-wake-up-call-for-ey/articleshow/113445667.cms,"Here’s the full text of the letter

From, Anita Augustine, Mother of Late Ms. Anna Sebastian Perayil

To, Rajiv Memani,

EY India Chairman

Dear Rajiv,

I am writing this letter as a grieving mother who has lost her precious child, Anna Sebastian Perayil. My heart is heavy, and my soul is shattered as I pen these words, but I believe it is necessary to share our story in the hope that no other family will have to endure the pain we are going through.

Anna passed her CA Exams in November'23 and joined EY Pune on March 19th, 2024, as an Executive. She was full of life, dreams, and excitement for the future. EY was her first job, and she was thrilled to be part of such a prestigious company. But four months later, on July 20th, 2024, my world collapsed when I received the devastating news that Anna had passed away. She was just 26 years old.

Anna was always a fighter, from childhood through her academic years, where she excelled in everything she did. She was a school topper, and a college topper, excelled in extracurricular activities, and passed her CA exams with distinction. She worked tirelessly at EY, giving her all to meet the demands placed on her. However, the workload, new environment, and long hours took a toll on her physically, emotionally, and mentally. She began experiencing anxiety, sleeplessness, and stress soon after joining, but she kept pushing herself, believing that hard work and perseverance were the keys to success.

On Saturday, July 6th, my husband and I reached Pune to attend Anna's CA Convocation. Since she had been complaining of chest constriction upon reaching her PG late at night (around 1 am) for the past week, we took her to the hospital in Pune. Her ECG was normal, and the cardiologist came to allay our fears, telling us she wasn't getting enough sleep and was eating very late. He prescribed antacids, which reassured us that it wasn't anything serious. Though we had come all the way from Kochi, she insisted on going to work after seeing the doctor, saying there was a lot of work to be done and she wouldn't get leave. That night, she returned to her PG late again. On Sunday, July 7th, the day of her convocation, she joined us in the morning, but she was working from home even that day until the afternoon, and we reached the convocation venue late.

It was my daughter's great dream to take her parents to her convocation with her own hard-earned money. She booked our flight tickets and took us. It breaks my heart to tell you that even during those two days, which were the last we would spend with our child, she couldn't enjoy them because of the work pressure.

When Anna joined this specific team, she was told that many employees had resigned due to the excessive workload, and the team manager told to her, ""Anna, you must stick around and

change everyone's opinion about our team."" My child didn't realize she would pay for that with her life.

Her manager would often reschedule meetings during cricket matches and assign her work at the end of the day, adding to her stress. At an office party, a senior leader even joked that she would have a tough time working under her manager, which, unfortunately, became a reality she could not escape.

Anna confided in us about the overwhelming workload, especially the additional tasks assigned verbally, beyond the official work. I would tell her not to take on such tasks, but the managers were relentless. She worked late into the night, even on weekends, with no opportunity to catch her breath. Her assistant manager once called her at night with a task that needed to be completed by the next morning, leaving her with barely any time to rest or recover. When she voiced her concerns, she was met with the dismissive response, ""You can work at night; that's what we all do.""

Anna would return to her room utterly exhausted, sometimes collapsing on the bed without even changing her clothes, only to be bombarded with messages asking for more reports. She was putting in her best efforts, working very hard to meet the deadlines. She was a fighter to the core, not someone to give up easily. We told her to quit, but she wanted to learn and gain new exposure. However, the overwhelming pressure proved too much even for her.

Anna would never have blamed her managers. She was too kind for that. But I cannot remain silent. Burdening newcomers with such backbreaking work, making them work day and night, even on Sundays, has no justification whatsoever. She had just left her hometown and loved ones. Everything was new to her—the organization, the place, the language—and she was trying very hard to adjust. You should show some consideration to new employees. Instead, the management took full advantage of the fact that she was new and overwhelmed her with both assigned and unassigned work.

This is a systemic issue that goes beyond individual managers or teams. The relentless demands and the pressure to meet unrealistic expectations are not sustainable, and they cost us the life of a young woman with no much potential.

Anna was a young professional, just starting her career. Like many in her position, she did not have the experience or the agency to draw boundaries or push back against unreasonable demands. She did not know how to say no. She was trying to prove herself in a new environment, and in doing so, she pushed herself beyond her limits. And now, she is no longer with us.

I wish I had been able to protect her, to tell her that her health and well-being mattered more than anything else. But it is too late for my Anna.

I am writing to you now, Rajiv, because I believe EY has a profound responsibility to ensure the well-being of its employees. Anna's experience sheds light on a work culture that seems to

glorify overwork while neglecting the very human beings behind the roles. This is not just about my daughter; it's about every young professional who joins EY filled with hopes and dreams, only to be crushed under the weight of unrealistic expectations. I took the time to read .EY's human rights statement. which bears your signature. I cannot reconcile the values expressed in that statement with the reality my daughter faced. How can EY begin to truly live by the values it professes?

Anna's death should serve as a wake-up call for EY. It is time to reflect on the work culture within your organization and take meaningful steps to prioritize the health and wellness of your employees. This means creating an environment where employees feel safe to speak up, where they are supported in managing their workload, and where their mental and physical well-being is not sacrificed for the sake of productivity.

No one from EY attended Anna's funeral. This absence at such a critical moment, for an employee who gave her all to your organization until her last breath, is deeply hurtful. Anna deserved better, and so do all the employees who continue to work under these conditions. My heart aches not just for the loss of my child but also for the lack of empathy shown by those who were supposed to guide and support her. After her funeral, I reached out to her managers, but I received no reply. How can a company that speaks of values and human rights fail to show up for one of its own in their final moments?

Becoming a Chartered Accountant involves years of toil, hardship, and sacrifice—not only for the student but also for the parents. Years of my child's hard work have been snuffed out by just four months of EY's callous attitude.

I hope this letter reaches you with the gravity it deserves. I don't know if anyone can truly understand a mother's emotions when she lays to rest her child—the child she held in her arms, watched grow, play, cry, and shared dreams with—unless they have experienced the same pain.

I hope my child's experience leads to real change so that no other family has to endure the grief and trauma we are going through. My Anna is no longer with us, but her story can still make a difference.

Sincerely, Anita Augustine.

Anna Sebastian Perayil , a chartered accountant from Kerala, passed away just four months into her employment at multinational firm Ernst & Young, EY. The death of the 26-year-old has raised concerns about workplace practices at the company. Anna’s mother, Anita Augustine blames ‘work stress’ at EY for the tragic death. Anita has written an email addressed to EY's India chief Rajiv Memani expressing her distress over the circumstances that led to her daughter’s death.“Anna was always a fighter, from childhood through her academic years, where she excelled in everything she did. She was a school topper, and a college topper, excelled in extracurricular activities, and passed her CA exams with distinction. She worked tirelessly at EY, giving her all to meet the demands placed on her,” she writes in the letter.Adding further, she stated “Burdening newcomers with such backbreaking work, making them work day and night, even on Sundays, has no justification whatsoever. She had just left her hometown and loved ones. Everything was new to her—the organization, the place, the language—and she was trying very hard to adjust. You should show some consideration to new employees. Instead, the management took full advantage of the fact that she was new and overwhelmed her with both assigned and unassigned work.”","Anna Sebastian Perayil was a 26-year-old executive at EY Pune, India.

What is “parking” that the DoJ is alleging

The US vs Google advertising hearing entered the second week on September 16. The ongoing antitrust lawsuit, filed by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) against Google in 2023, focuses on Google's alleged dominance in the digital advertising technology (ad tech) market. The trial kicked off with YouTube CEO Neal Mohan testifying that Google's success is driven by innovation and not by crushing rivals.Defending Google's ad tech practices, Mohan refuted accusations by the DoJ that the company crushed rivals as it became an advertising behemoth. He said that the search giant faced tough competition in the ad tech market, and the accusations were not to crush the competition but to enhance the services and tools offered by the company to its business customers, including publishers and advertisers.Google’s success “falls back to one single thing: product innovation and the sale and services we were able to offer,” Mohan said in his testimony.Lawyers for the Justice Department highlighted emails, memos and other documents alleging that Google removed the competition through acquisitions of rivals – such as DoubleClick and ad tech tool competitor AdMeld - because it was a threat. The government sees it as evidence that Google was trying to take a competition out, as per The Verge.Justice Department lawyer Aaron Teitelbaum pointed out a 2010 email that Mohan wrote about Google acquiring AdMeld, then “parking” it within the company. Mohan joined Google as part of its acquisition of the advertising software company DoubleClick in 2008.“If you bought one and parked it, it would let us solve the problems from a position of strength,” replied the recipient, a fellow Google employee.Mohan clarified that “parking” the company didn’t mean it will stop offering services. “That’s absolutely not what was going on,” he said.He said that Google's interest in Admeld stemmed from its advanced development, but assured that Google had no plans to abandon the product. He explained that ""parking"" an acquired company means allowing it to function independently while Google gradually integrates its technology. This process can take years.Ultimately, he stated, Google’s goal was to ""build the best advertising stack for publishers, as well as tools for advertisers.""",The US vs Google advertising hearing entered the second week on September 16.

Salesforce has launched Agentforce Partner Network – the world’s first AI agent ecosystem that will allow its partner companies to build third-party AI agents and actions, which then can be used to take on specific tasks depending on the requirements of businesses.In easier words, Salesforce’s Agentforce Partner Network is like an app store for AI assistants/ agents from where customers will be able to easily install these agents and deploy them for specialised industry or business needs.According to Brian Millham, president and COO at Salesforce, the company aims to enable customers with a billion AI agents over the next year.Imagine a really smart digital assistant that can do a bunch of tasks, like answering customer questions or helping you find new sales leads. That's basically an AI agent. AI agents are specifically designed to perform various tasks autonomously, such as reasoning, data retrieval, planning and action execution. For example, an AI agent can be developed specifically to take care of tasks related to employees’ leaves in an organisation, so HRs and managers can easily distribute their time in other works.The Agentforce Partner Network allows these AI agents to interface with multiple systems, databases, and other agents, addressing the complexity of enterprise environments where thousands of applications are typically managed.The platform not only allows customers to access a catalogue of third-party skills, actions and agents within the Salesforce Platform, but also develop new skills to make AI agents even more capable or use available templates to create new agents.Salesforce has announced that the AI agents from Agentforce Partner Network can be accessed and downloaded from partner platforms like Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud , Honeywell, IBM, Zoom, and more.","Salesforce partners with Google Cloud, AWS, IBM and more to distribute agents.

Netflix on Luck director Soham Shah's claim that Squid Games is a copy of his movie: There is no …,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/netflix-on-luck-director-soham-shahs-claim-that-squid-games-is-a-copy-of-his-movie-there-is-no-/articleshow/113436690.cms,"What Netflix said in its statement

Netflix stated in a statement, ""Squid Game was created and written by Hwang Dong-hyuk, and we intend to defend this matter vigorously."" Both parties insist that any resemblance between the two works is purely coincidental and that Squid Game is an entirely original creation.

Indian filmmaker Soham Shah has filed a lawsuit against Netflix and Hwang Dong-hyuk , the creator of the hit series Squid Game , alleging plagiarism. Shah claims that the central concept of a deadly competition with a growing jackpot, featured in Squid Game, was first portrayed in his 2009 film Luck.According to Shah, Luck revolves around a group of people competing in life-threatening games, with the prize money increasing as participants die.He argues that this plotline is strikingly similar to Squid Game, where financially desperate individuals engage in dangerous games with deadly consequences. Shah's legal team emphasizes that this similarity is not a mere coincidence but rather evidence of plagiarism.Shah asserts that he conceived the story for Luck around 2006, and the film was subsequently released globally in July 2009. He further notes that Hwang Dong-hyuk, the creator of Squid Game, has stated that he began working on the script for his series in the same year, 2009.Netflix and Hwang Dong-hyuk have vehemently denied the accusations.Hwang has previously mentioned that he began developing the script for Squid Game in 2009, the same year Luck was released. However, Netflix maintains that this timeline does not support Shah's claims of plagiarism.The lawsuit has sparked a legal battle between the two parties. The outcome of the case will determine whether Shah's allegations hold merit and if Squid Game was indeed influenced by his film Luck.","Indian filmmaker Soham Shah has filed a lawsuit against Netflix and Hwang Dong- hyuk.
