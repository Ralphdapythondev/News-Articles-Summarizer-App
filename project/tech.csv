"How Microsoft, AWS are keeping Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang ‘worried’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-microsoft-aws-are-keeping-nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-worried/articleshow/111120964.cms,"What Nvidia CEO said in employee meetings

How AI boom is helping Nvidia

Nvidia surged to the top of the global tech market capitalization leaderboard, leapfrogging Apple and Microsoft to become the world's most-valuable company. The chipmaker is riding the AI wave and is the largest AI GPU supplier with companies like Microsoft and Amazon Web Services ( AWS ) as its clients. However, if a report is to be believed, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has a growing concern.The Information reported that around Christmas last year, Huang discussed a growing concern with company executives in a series of meetings. He was reportedly worried whether its largest buyers have enough space to set up data centres, and if not, they may not buy more.“Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang called a series of meetings with company executives to discuss a growing concern: whether Nvidia's biggest customers were going to run out of data centre space to install its artificial intelligence chips, which could hurt sales,” the report said, citing a person who attended these meetings.As per the report, the Nvidia's CEO expressed concern to colleagues that cloud giants like AWS and Microsoft – major buyers of Nvidia's AI chips (GPUs) – weren't expanding data centres and power infrastructure fast enough to handle their orders.“After the meetings, Nvidia managers stepped up their pace of asking cloud providers whether they had enough space and electricity to accommodate their orders,” the report cited an employee at Nvidia and several customers and data centre operators, as saying.Since 2023, Nvidia has been on an upward spiral in the AI space, thanks to its advanced GPUs that are specifically designed for the demanding computations required by generative AI training. Nvidia holds an estimated 80% market share in AI chip manufacturing, and tech giants like Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, Alphabet (Google's parent company) as well as OpenAI all rely on Nvidia's hardware.Nvidia is looking for continued growth and recently launched their supercomputing AI GPU, Blackwell . Huang has also outlined plans to expand beyond cloud businesses, targeting consumer internet companies, automotive manufacturers and healthcare providers for future market share.","N Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has a growing concern.

Facebook's biggest-ever restructuring in hardware division to see job cuts; read Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth's memo to employees,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/facebooks-biggest-ever-restructuring-in-hardware-division-to-see-job-cuts-read-meta-cto-andrew-bosworths-memo-to-employees/articleshow/111121224.cms,"Here's the company-wide memo that Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth sent to the staff

An Update to RL’s Structure

With Quest 3 bringing MR into the mainstream, we have finally gotten to a place where we feel like all the major components are in place for us to grow our software platform consistently. The best reflection of that is that now we have a long-term vision of how the software experience is going to evolve over the next two years.

Meanwhile Ray-Ban Meta glasses are a much bigger hit than we anticipated which bodes well for our near-term AR roadmap. Combine that with the exciting functionality of Meta AI, we see a lot more value from the products we are building even before the full AR vision is ready.

As Mark and I discussed at IRL, we’re seeing the different paths we’ve taken start to narrow and come into sharper focus. Here are the changes we’re making to recognize and capitalize on that shift.

Metaverse

We’re bringing the team working on MR into the Metaverse product group led by Vishal Shah and realigning the components to be more horizontally aligned instead of vertical. We are deeply committed to investing in Horizon as the core foundation of our social, spatial Horizon OS, and high-quality experiences for both mixed reality and mobile. This new structure will enable us to create a more integrated product experience across hardware, software, and experiences with less friction and fragmentation.

This will also help us deliver a unified platform with the right components and toolchain so we can become the preferred choice for creators and developers building on the next generation of computing devices. I cannot stress enough how important it is for us to get these platform pieces right and it has been a challenge to make progress in our current structure. I’m excited to see all of this take shape.

Wearables

We’re renaming the AR product group led by Alex Himel to Wearables. We have the leading AI device on the market right now, and we are doubling down on finding strong product market fit for wearable Meta AI, building a business around it, and expanding the audience. Our north star to overlay digital content seamlessly onto the physical world remains the same but the steps on that path just got a lot more exciting.

The immense opportunities AI’s acceleration has brought to the team has already led to a horizontal restructuring late last year so that they can move faster against these tailwinds and continue to integrate product areas into one coherent roadmap across wearable form factors, platform, and AI.

XR Tech, Devices, and RLBG

As part of this change we are also moving parts of XR Tech that are closely tied to product or platform into Wearables and Metaverse as appropriate.

In turn, we will be rethinking the interface between Devices and XR Tech. XR Tech will remain our primary team focused on developing technology too early or risky for product teams to adopt, especially if it benefits both Metaverse and Wearables. We will share more details of this when we have them in a couple of weeks.

RLBG, under Dan Reed, will be federating content design into the product groups. Other groups like PMM, UXR, Analytics, and Sales will remain centralized as they are today. However we are creating two new roles we are calling “business group leads”, one for Metaverse and one for Wearables, to partner with their respective product group leads and help them coordinate across the breadth of RLBG.

The Road Ahead

The org chart doesn’t primarily determine whether we succeed or fail, our execution does, but by setting it up this way I hope we reduce overhead and allow people across teams to come together and execute with a more unified view of who our customers are and how we can best serve them.

(Note: The memo first appeared in by The Verge)

Facebook parent Meta CTO Andrew “Boz” Bosworth reportedly announced the biggest restructuring of the company’s hardware division since it was renamed to Reality Labs in the year 2020. According to an exclusive report in 'The Verge', all teams in Reality Labs will be consolidated into two groups: A central ' Metaverse ' organization and a new 'Wearables' organization.This restructuring aims to create a more seamless experience for users by bringing hardware, software, and metaverse development under closer collaboration. Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth explains, ""This new structure allows us to create a more integrated product experience across hardware, software, and experiences, reducing friction and fragmentation."" The restructuring also involves a small number of layoffs within Reality Labs. These primarily target management positions that became redundant due to the new, streamlined organizational structure.By restructuring Reality Labs, Meta aims to create an integrated product experience across hardware, software and experiences. Mixed reality hardware and software will now be developed in the same department: ""This new structure will enable us to create a more integrated product experience across hardware, software, and experiences with less friction and fragmentation,"" says Bosworth.Metaverse Division: This division will focus on building a cohesive metaverse experience. It will include the popular Quest VR headset line, Horizon operating system (Horizon OS) and the social VR platform Horizon Worlds. Vishal Shah , who previously led Horizon, will now oversee both Horizon and the Quest product line under the Metaverse umbrella.Wearables Division: This division will concentrate on Meta's future in augmented reality (AR). It will encompass AR projects like smart glasses and AR headsets, with an emphasis on integrating technology from Meta AI. This division will be led by veteran Meta VP Alex Himel.","Reality Labs will be consolidated into two groups: A central 'Metaverse' organization and a new 'Wearables' organization.

"Goldman Sachs, Ozy Media, YouTube Originals exec and '$40 million fake conference call' scam where Google CEO Sundar Pichai testified",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/goldman-sachs-ozy-media-youtube-originals-exec-and-40-million-fake-conference-call-scam-where-google-ceo-sundar-pichai-had-to-testify/articleshow/111121113.cms,"Sundar Pichai: Never offered to buy Ozy Media for $600 million

Goldman Sachs bankers called the call ""very disturbing""

Google parent Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai recently took the witness stand at the fraud trial of Ozy Media Inc co-founder Carlos Watson , testifying that the search giant never intended to buy the startup for any amount of money.Carlos Watson, co-founder of media startup Ozy Media, is on trial for allegedly defrauding investors of tens of millions of dollars by misrepresenting the company's success, according to a Bloomberg report. Prosecutors claim Watson lied about multiple aspects of Ozy's business, including boasting that Google had offered to buy the company for hundreds of millions of dollars.The once-prominent media company collapsed in 2021 after The New York Times exposed a scheme where Ozy's COO, Samir Rao, impersonated a senior Google executive during a call with Goldman Sachs bankers. Rao, who has pleaded guilty, testified that he and Watson aimed to mislead investors into believing Ozy was profitable.Google CEO Sundar Pichai refuted Watson's claims during his testimony, stating that Google never considered acquiring Ozy, though they did explore hiring Watson to lead their news programming. Pichai also clarified that a potential $25 million investment was part of that proposed employment deal.""Mr. Watson was a critical part of Ozy Media, and we were considering making an investment in the company to make the transition easier,"" Pichai said, according to Bloomberg.When questioned by the prosecutor, Pichai denied ever offering to buy Ozy for $600 million. Prosecutors allege Watson used this fabricated Google offer to secure additional investment after the Goldman Sachs deal fell through.Despite Watson's claims of a close relationship with Google's CEO, Pichai revealed they had only spoken twice: briefly at a conference and during Watson's job interview, which occurred weeks after the Goldman Sachs call and for which he was ultimately not selected.Other witnesses included Goldman Sachs bankers who participated in the call where Rao impersonated the Google executive. Hillel Moerman, one of two Goldman bankers who were on the February 2, 2021, call when Rao impersonated YouTube executive Alex Piper. Moerman reportedly told jurors it was “one of the most disturbing calls I’ve been on in my career.”Moerman described it as “a surreal experience. The person spoke in an unnaturally deep voice.” Goldman was reportedly considering a $35 million investment in Ozy and had requested the call after Watson claimed YouTube was one of Ozy’s “most important” clients.Another Goldman banker, Allison Berardo, testified that what she and Moerman heard on the call “did not sound like a human voice.” “We were both in a state of shock,” Moerman said, as per the Bloomberg report. “Something was off.”Ozy's former chief of staff, Suzee Han, also testified, admitting her role in the scheme. ""We lied about Ozy's past performance and historical financials,"" Han said according to Bloomberg. ""We lied about how the company was doing at that time, so the company's current performance. We lied about how the company was going to do.""The trial is ongoing.","Carlos Watson, co-founder of media startup Ozy Media, is on trial for allegedly defrauding investors of tens of millions of dollars by misrepresenting the company's success.

Take a Break reminders

Crisis resource panels

Last year, Google-owned YouTube announced partnership and product updates to support wellbeing and mental health of teens on the platform. It is now rolling out those features, which include limiting the recommendation of videos that could be negative if watched repeatedly, in more countries.James Beser, director, product management, recently spoke about how teens can navigate their growing individual interests. He emphasised that YouTube's updates will help teens put their safety, privacy and wellbeing on priority.Beser explained how YouTube is limiting repeated content recommendations for teens of videos featuring social comparison and aggression. The company worked with an Advisory Committee to identify ""categories of content that may be innocuous as a single video, but could be problematic for some teens if viewed in repetition.""""These categories include content that compares physical features and idealises some types over others, idealises specific fitness levels or body weights, or displays social aggression in the form of non-contact fights and intimidation,"" the company said in a blog post when it announced the features in November.To help teens manage their screen time, YouTube notifies them with ""Take a Break reminders"". These reminders will help teens set boundaries to manage time spent online and disconnect when needed. The feature is available since 2018, and is on by default for teens users (for every 60 minutes) but will now be visually prominent in viewers’ feeds across long-form and Shorts. Beser also said that these reminders will now appear more frequently.YouTube is also expanding crisis resource panels into a new full-page experience. When teens search for sensitive topics such as related to suicide, self-harm, and eating disorders on YouTube, a new full-page experience will help viewers pause for a moment and explore health topics.""Viewers will more prominently see resources for third-party crisis hotlines as well as suggested prompts to steer search queries towards topics like 'self-compassion' or 'grounding exercises', the company said. This feature has also rolled out for viewers of all ages where crisis resource panels are available.","Google-owned YouTube is rolling out new features to support teens' wellbeing.

Why Meta AI will answer election-related queries in India while Google Gemini will not,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-meta-ai-will-answer-election-related-queries-in-india-while-google-gemini-will-not/articleshow/111119067.cms,"Meta AI's results on elections queries

What Google has to say

Meta has lifted restrictions on election-related queries for its AI chatbot in India. In contrast, Google maintains its global limitations on such inquiries. In the run-up to the elections, both the tech giants limited responses to election-related queries in the country. This means users of Meta AI can ask political questions from the chatbot while Google Gemini still does not provide any information.The development was first reported by TechCrunch. Members of The Times of India Tech team, who have access to Meta AI, checked to verify the claims and found that Meta AI on Instagram and WhatsApp are responding to queries related to political leaders and returning queries on Lok Sabha elections 2024 . However, it is to be noted that the AI chatbot may still not provide answers to uncommon questions that users may ask.“This is a new technology, and it may not always return the response we intend, which is the same for all generative AI systems. Since we launched, we’ve constantly released updates and improvements to our models, and we’re continuing to work on making them better,” a company spokesperson previously told the publication.The Facebook-parent company started blocking certain political queries in April, and pointed users towards the Election Commission’s website.Google is not removing restrictions on election-related queries in the wake of elections happening around the world, the company said.“With major elections happening around the world this year, and out of an abundance of caution, we’re restricting the types of election-related queries for which Gemini will return responses and instead point people to Google Search. These restrictions are applied globally,” a Google spokesperson told TechCrunch.When given a query on any political leader or election, Gemini returns, ""I'm still learning how to answer this question. In the meantime, try Google Search.""","Users of Meta AI can ask political questions from the chatbot while Google Gemini still does not provide any information.

"SIM swap scam: What is it, causes, signs, and tips for prevention",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-tips/sim-swap-scam-what-is-it-causes-signs-and-tips-for-prevention/articleshow/111082258.cms,"SIM swap scams causes

Social engineering: Scammers use various techniques to deceive victims and mobile carrier employees into believing they are the legitimate owner of the phone number. This can involve phishing emails, calls, or text messages to collect personal information.

Data breaches: Large-scale data breaches can provide scammers with the necessary information to impersonate victims. This data can include names, addresses, social security numbers, and phone numbers.

Insider threats: In some cases, scammers may bribe or coerce employees within mobile carrier companies to facilitate the SIM swap.

Weak security practices: Mobile carriers sometimes have insufficient security protocols for verifying identity before transferring a number to a new SIM, making it easier for scammers to execute their schemes.

Signs you might be a victim of a SIM swap scam

Sudden loss of service: If your phone suddenly loses service and displays ""No Service"" or ""Emergency Calls Only,"" it could be a sign that your number has been transferred to another SIM.

Inability to make calls or send texts: If you can no longer make calls or send texts, it might indicate that your SIM card has been deactivated.

Unusual account activity: You might receive notifications of unusual login attempts or password changes from your email, bank, or social media accounts.

Receiving messages about SIM card changes: If you receive notifications from your mobile carrier about SIM card changes that you did not initiate, this is a red flag.

Access denied to accounts: If you are suddenly unable to access your bank accounts, email, or social media accounts despite entering the correct passwords, it could be a result of a SIM swap.

How to protect yourself from SIM swap scams

Enhance account security: Use strong, unique passwords for all online accounts and change them regularly. Avoid using easily guessable information such as birthdays or common words.

Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): Use 2FA methods that do not rely on SMS-based codes. Consider using authenticator apps or hardware tokens instead.

Be wary of phishing attempts: Do not click on links or download attachments from unknown or suspicious emails and messages. Verify the sender's identity before responding.

Monitor your accounts: Regularly check your bank, email, and social media accounts for any suspicious activity. Set up alerts to notify you of any unauthorised transactions or changes.

Contact your mobile carrier: Ask your mobile carrier to add a PIN or password to your account for an extra layer of security. Some carriers also offer the option to disable remote SIM swapping entirely.

Use identity protection services: Consider using identity theft protection services that monitor your personal information and alert you to potential fraud.

Report suspicious activity: If you suspect you are a victim of a SIM swap scam, contact your mobile carrier immediately to restore your service and secure your accounts. Additionally, report the incident to your bank and other relevant institutions.

Version 9.4 of the app, which is currently rolling out via the Google Play Store, adds a Pro Lens selection mode and improves the HDR+ functionality on supported Pixel phones like the Pixel 6 Pro, Pixel 7 Pro, Pixel 8 Pro and Pixel Fold.One of the key additions in Pixel Camera 9.4 is the new Pro Lens selection feature. This allows users to manually choose between the ultra-wide, wide, and telephoto lenses on their device when taking a photo, rather than relying on the camera app to automatically select the appropriate lens. The Pro Lens option can be found under a new ""Pro"" tab in the camera settings.The update also brings improvements to HDR+ ( High Dynamic Range Plus ), Google's computational photography technology that combines multiple exposures to create images with better detail and dynamic range. Pixel Camera 9.4 enhances HDR+ with smarter automatic frame selection, favouring shots where subjects have their eyes open and are smiling.Additionally, the placement of the RAW/JPEG toggle has been moved from an obscure location in the settings to the more easily accessible Pro tab. However, unlike the Pixel 8 Pro, there is no option to adjust the image resolution.While the new version of Pixel Camera is currently available for download, users may not see the new features immediately after installing the update. The additional functionality is expected to be enabled via a server-side update from Google or with the release of the June Pixel Feature Drop .","Google has begun rolling out version 9.4 of its Pixel Camera app. It adds a Pro Lens selection mode and improves the HDR+ functionality on supported Pixel phones.

A US District Court has fined Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) a total of $194.2 million (roughly Rs 1,600 crore) on charges of alleged misappropriation of trade secrets. The order against TCS has been passed in a case filed by Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC), which has merged with DXC Technology Company (DXC), alleging misappropriation of the company's trade secrets before United States district court.TCS informed the court order to the Stock Exchange Board of India (SEBI) in a BSE filing. It added it will appeal against the court order and file a review petition. ""Pursuant to Regulation 30 of SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, we hereby inform you that the Company has received an adverse judgement passed by United States District Court, Northern District of Texas, Dallas Division, details of which are provided in Annexure A.""Giving details about the lawsuit filed by CSC, the BSE filing says, ""In a suit filed by Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC)/DXC Technology Company (DXC) against the Company, alleging misappropriation of its trade secrets:* The Court ordered that the Company is liable to CSC for $56,151,583 in compensatory damages and $ 112,303,166 in exemplary damages.• The Court also assessed that the Company is liable for $25,773,576.60 in prejudgment interest through June 13, 2024.• The Court also passed certain injunctions and other reliefs against the Company.“The court ordered that the company is liable to CSC for $56,151,583 in compensatory damages and $112,303,166 in exemplary damages,” the Mumbai-basedsoftware services company said in a regulatory filing.Responding to the court ruling, the Tata group company said that the judgement won’t have any major adverse impact on its financials and operations.

TCS had secured a $2 billion contract with Transamerica the previous year. The suit accused TCS of exploiting the software access granted to 2,200 Transamerica employees, who were transferred to TCS, to learn about CSC’s software internals and create a rival insurance platform. The court found that TCS had improperly accessed and used confidential data from DXC’s insurance management software, resulting in a $70 million penalty for trade secret misappropriation and an additional $140 million for deliberate infringement.Furthermore, Transamerica terminated its decade-long agreement with TCS prematurely in June 2023.

Steven Spielberg startled by Apple Watch’s false alarm: Here’s what happened,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/steven-spielberg-startled-by-apple-watchs-false-alarm-heres-what-happened/articleshow/111052524.cms,"What exactly happened

What is Apple Watch’s fall detection feature

Legendary director Steven Spielberg had a moment of onstage surprise during a recent Tribeca Film Festival talk. According to a report by Variety, his Apple Watch abruptly displayed a warning about a potential hard fall, causing a brief disruption.The incident occurred while Spielberg was discussing his early films. The Apple Watch's fall detection feature, designed to initiate emergency services after a tumble, mistakenly interpreted a movement as a fall. Spielberg, likely startled by the unexpected alert, reportedly removed the watch from his wrist.Unfortunately, this reaction triggered another failsafe. With no response from Spielberg to the on-screen prompt, the Apple Watch initiated an audible countdown before attempting an emergency call. However, Spielberg realised the situation and quickly silenced the alert before any unnecessary dispatch of emergency personnel.While such false alarms are uncommon with Apple Watches, they can occur at inconvenient times. The episode highlights the potential for these safety features to cause momentary confusion, especially when users are unaware of the proper response protocol.In this case, a simple press of the ""X"" on the watch screen would have dismissed the fall warning.Apple Watch's fall detection feature is designed to identify when you've taken a hard fall and potentially connect you with emergency services.“If Apple Watch SE, Apple Watch Series 4 or later, or Apple Watch Ultra or later detects a hard fall while you’re wearing your watch, it will tap you on the wrist, sound an alarm and display an alert. You can choose to contact the emergency services, or dismiss the alert by pressing the Digital Crown, tapping Close in the top left-hand corner or tapping “I'm OK”, said the company.","Apple Watch's fall detection feature is designed to identify when you've taken a hard fall and potentially connect you with emergency services.

It’s a long-running rumour about Apple working on a slimmer version of the iPhone. The rumours earlier suggest that the iPhone - Slim could happen with the iPhone 16 series. However, new reports claim that it will arrive in 2025 with the iPhone 17 series.Mark Gurman , in its latest Power On newsletter, has revealed that Apple will be making an iPhone 17 with a slimmer overall chassis and this will be the thinnest-ever iPhone along with a slimmer version of MacBook Pro and Apple Watch.Apple plans to go “Slim” in 2025Based on the report, Apple is reportedly planning to go slim with almost every product it offers.
