Government suspends these two telemarketing companies over sending 5.5 million fraud SMSes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/government-suspends-these-two-telemarketing-companies-over-fraud-smses/articleshow/111823013.cms,"The duo sent over 5mn fraud SMSes since Jan, 2024, DoT claims

What the companies has to say about it?

Amid rising SMS frauds in the country, the department of telecommunications ( DoT ) has suspended operations of two telemarketing companies, namely V-con Intelligent Security and OneXtel Media, reports Economic Times. In its direction dated July 15, the telecom department said that the two misused their platform to send malicious and phishing SMSes, the report states.“In the interest of safeguarding the citizens from cybercrime/financial frauds, all the TSPs (telecom service providers) are directed to: immediately suspend these two RTMs (registered telemarketers )…(and) lodge police complaint against them for misusing DLT platform for sending malicious and phishing SMSes,” read the DoT direction.V-con - a part of the Videocon Group, and OneXtel Media were found responsible for sending 55.5 million fraudulent SMSes to smartphone users since January 2024. DoT’s action comes after receiving several complaints filed by telecom users on the Chakshu portal about malicious SMSes.Quoting officials involved in the investigations, the ET report states that the DoT ordered blacklisting of 131 principal entities (PEs), 5,000 SMS content templates, and 700 SMS headers. However, the fraud senders came up with new headers to cheat the blockchain-based SMS filtering system.The ET report says that it was also found that one among these two entities – V-con and OneXtel – had received money from bank accounts that were involved in multiple complaints of organised transnational crimes, including illegal stock investment frauds.As per the report, OneXtel has strongly opposed the government’s suspension on grounds that the company was not given any opportunity to present its case. Abrar Chunawala, chief executive of OneXtel Media said “We are in cognizance of DoT’s order but also surprised on how the government has casted the burden on a reputed telemarketer like us operating since nine years. It must be noted that we were never intimated about the department’s action, no show-cause notice was served.”“The 55.5 million ballpark figure given in the order, presumably is for 6 months and belongs to two entities. Let’s assume 17 million of these were passed through Onextel. This represents only 0.06% of our total traffic. Is it then fair to suddenly put a company out of business for such a small percentage? As per regulation, it is the responsibility of telecom companies to operate the DLT system. Are they not at fault along with their DLT tech partners?” Chunawala added.",V-con Intelligent Security and OneXtel Media were found responsible for sending 55.5 million fraudulent SMSes to smartphone users since January 2024.

How Google and Microsoft may be providing Chinese tech firms access Nvidia’s AI chip despite US ban,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-google-and-microsoft-may-be-providing-chinese-tech-firms-access-nvidias-ai-chip-despite-us-ban/articleshow/111815943.cms,"Chinese firms can access ‘banned’ AI models via cloud

The US has banned sale of Nvidia ’s high-performance AI chips to China, however, Chinese companies may still be able to use those processors via data centres run by Google , Microsoft and other tech companies.According to a report by The Information, companies in China gaining access to some of Nvidia’s AI chips by renting Nvidia-powered servers at data centres outside China from Google, Microsoft and other global firms underline a gap in US export rules.Notably, both Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure are offering to rent Nvidia's Al chips to Chinese companies, including AI startups, for use in data centres outside China. In fact, a recent report suggested that Elon Musk-owned X was also in talks with Oracle to rent Nvidia’s highly in-demand H100 AI processors.“But apart from the biggest US tech giants, there is a whole sector of smaller cloud providers specialising in offering access to Nvidia-powered servers around the world, and their services are available to Chinese customers,” the report noted, adding that some of these cloud providers are based in the US, while numerous others are based in Europe and Asia.Earlier this month, reports said ChatGPT-maker is blocking access to technology used to build AI products for entities in China because the chatbot is not available in the country. However, the publication reported, developers in China can still access those models via a Microsoft Service.“OpenAI's conversational Al models are available to Chinese businesses-if they sign up for Microsoft's Azure cloud service, which operates in China through a local joint venture,” The Information said, citing the company’s public statements.Notably, Microsoft operates as a joint venture with local company 21Vianet to offer Azure's OpenAI service in China. Moreover, three Azure China customers even claimed that they got access to OpenAI's models.","US has banned sale of Nvidia’s high-performance AI chips to China.

Amazon has this 'coffee solution' to track the hours employees spend in office,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/amazon-has-this-coffee-solution-to-track-the-hours-employees-spend-in-office/articleshow/111817731.cms,"What is ""coffee badging"" by employees

Amazon is reportedly intensifying its push for employees to return to the office by implementing strict new attendance measures . According to a report in Business Insider, citing internal communications and sources familiar with the matter, several departments, including retail and cloud computing, are now required to spend a minimum of two hours in the office per visit.Some teams have even been mandated to stay for at least six hours.""Amazon is now monitoring the hours corporate employees spend in the office. This move is intended to crack down on people who are trying to skirt the company's return-to-office policy ,"" said the report.The new rule is said to be aimed to stop "" coffee badging "" employees who briefly stop by to satisfy the RTO mandate. The move is a direct response to what Amazon terms ""coffee badging,"" a practice where employees badge in, get coffee, and leave the office shortly to satisfy their return-to-office mandate. The company aims to curb this behavior and ensure compliance with its return-to-office policy, which was introduced last year, requiring most corporate staff to be in the office three days a week.This latest development marks a new chapter in Amazon's ongoing battle to bring employees back to the workplace. The tech giant has faced significant backlash from staff, including a petition signed by over 30,000 employees opposing the policy. In response, Amazon has taken a hardline stance, implementing measures such as mandatory relocation for certain employees and denying promotions to non-compliant staff. CEO Andy Jassy has also publicly warned employees to leave the company if they cannot adhere to the return-to-office mandate.In an email to BI, Margaret Callahan, an Amazon spokesperson, said the company has started to ""speak directly"" to employees who haven't spent enough time in the office.","Amazon is reportedly intensifying its push for employees to return to the office.

"How and why NASA is using AI, machine learning on Mars",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-and-why-nasa-is-using-ai-machine-learning-on-mars/articleshow/111815436.cms,"What AI software is being used and how it works

Perseverance not the only AI-loaded rover on Mars

Artificial intelligence (AI) is proving to be a versatile tool with applications across numerous fields – from accelerating drug discovery in healthcare and safeguarding against financial fraud to pioneering materials research. In a first, AI has now made its mark beyond Earth, with its deployment on Mars marking a significant technological leap.NASA recently announced that AI is helping scientists to identify minerals within rocks studied by the Perseverance rover .While “smart” spacecrafts are still a bit far from becoming reality, advances made with NASA’s Perseverance Mars rover essentially offer promising steps in that direction.NASA said that for nearly three years, the mission has been testing AI to identify minerals within Martian rocks on Earth. However, it is now for the first time that AI has been used by the Perseverance rover on Mars to make autonomous decisions about rock composition, marking a pivotal moment in planetary exploration.The AI software that is driving this exploration supports PIXL (Planetary Instrument for X-ray Lithochemistry), which is a spectrometer developed by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). The instrument maps the chemical composition of minerals across a rock’s surface, and helps scientists to determine whether it formed in conditions that could have been supportive of microbial life in Mars’ ancient past.The AI-powered “adaptive sampling” software autonomously positions the instrument close to a rock target and analyses scans of the target to find minerals worth examining more deeply. NASA says this is all done in real time, without the rover talking to mission controllers back on Earth.“We use PIXL’s AI to home in on key science. Without it, you’d see a hint of something interesting in the data and then need to rescan the rock to study it more. This lets PIXL reach a conclusion without humans examining the data,” said the instrument’s principal investigator, Abigail Allwood of JPL.The system automatically focuses on interesting minerals, improving with machine learning . Based on the analysis done by Perseverance, scientists then decide when to ‘pack’ the sample for bringing back to Earth.AI is also playing a crucial role in the working of Curiosity rovers – stationed about 3,700 kilometres from Perseverance. Curiosity utilises AI to independently select and analyse rocks using a laser, determining their chemical composition by studying the vaporised material.Notably, Perseverance builds upon this by employing a more advanced AI system for autonomous navigation. While both rovers still require human oversight, these AI capabilities significantly enhance their efficiency and scientific return, allowing scientists to accomplish more tasks in a shorter time frame.","NASA recently announced that AI is helping scientists to identify minerals within rocks studied by the Perseverance rover.

UK government’s guidance on smartphone use by kids

In a major move, a posh boarding school in the UK has decided to swap its students’ smartphones for the classic Nokia phones, reports CBS News. The policy is based on guidelines from the UK government that allows school principals to enact smartphone bans on students during the school day.Eton College , the historic and elite British boarding school is located near the royal palace in Windsor. Prince William and Harry, Ian Fleming, Tom Hiddleston and novelist George Orwell are some of its notable alumni.As per the report, parents of first-year students at Eton College were informed about the changes in a letter. It reportedly said that the incoming 13-year-old boarders must transfer their SIM cards to offline Nokia phones given by schools. The phone will only be able to make phone calls and send text messages.The report quotes a school spokesperson who said “Eton routinely reviews our mobile phone and devices policy to balance the benefits and challenges that technology brings to schools.” He further added that those joining in Year 9, essentially the equivalent of freshman year in high school for American students, “will receive a 'brick' phone for use outside the school day, as well as a school-issued iPad to support academic study.”According to Ofcom, the UK government's communications regulator, 97% of children have their own smartphone phone by the age of 12. In the new guidelines issued in February this year, the government advised all schools to “have a behaviour policy which is aligned with the school’s legal duties and standards relating to the welfare of children.
