Apple reshuffles design team amid leadership changes: This veteran now leads the unit,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-reshuffles-design-team-amid-leadership-changes-this-veteran-now-leads-the-unit/articleshow/112270713.cms,"Changes at Apple’s design leadership

Apple has reportedly undergone a significant restructuring of its industrial design team. As per Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, the company has been grappling with leadership changes since the departure of former design chief Jony Ive in 2019. The iPhone maker now has a bunch of people reporting to veteran Molly Anderson , who has been elevated to industrial design leader.“Recently, Apple shook things up. Though the company hasn’t named a full replacement for Hankey — and still considers Williams the head of all design at Apple — it elevated veteran Molly Anderson to industrial design leader. The bulk of Apple’s designers now report to her directly instead of Williams,” Gurman said in the latest edition of his newsletter Power On.However, Gurman notes, Anderson isn’t considered a company vice president – unlike Evans Hankey who replaced Jony Ive and Richard Howarth , Apple’s longest-serving designer.Ive’s successor Hankey also left Apple in 2022, followed by a mass exodus of key design talent. This led to a leadership vacuum and a design team primarily composed of newer employees who essentially do not have direct experience under Ive and Steve Jobs .To address the void, Apple initially placed design under the purview of (chief operating officer) COO Jeff Williams . However, the company recently appointed veteran Anderson as the new head of industrial design.Apple continues to search for a permanent replacement for Hankey, suggesting that the company is still in flux when it comes to its design leadership structure.Recently, Ive, who designed the first iPhone, shared his experience about working with Apple co-founder and former CEO Steve Jobs. Describing their collaboration as ""the most joyful and extraordinary 15 years of my life"", Ive said that he felt an instant connection when he first met Steve Jobs.“It's a feeling I think that we both had, which was just this remarkable click,” Ive told said in an interview episode of the ""Life in Seven Songs"" podcast. Ive is responsible for the iconic designs of products like the iPhone, iPad, and MacBook, joined Apple in 1992 but didn't meet Jobs until 1997.Their partnership began when Jobs appointed Ive as Apple's senior vice president of industrial design in 1997.",Apple has reportedly undergone a significant restructuring of its industrial design team.

Why Berkshire Hathway sold Apple shares

The world's largest investment group Warren Buffett ’s Berkshire Hathaway has reportedly reduced its holding in Apple, selling off roughly half of its stake in the iPhone maker as part of a wider $76bn stock disposal. According to a report in Financial Times, quoting an SEC filing, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway has slashed its stake in iPhone maker Apple in half as part of a selling spree in which the billionaire investor sold $76 billion of stocks.Warren Buffet-led investment company slashed its Apple position by more than $50 billion to $84.2 billion in the second quarter, according to filings released on Saturday, August 3. The move generated a substantial $47.2bn after-tax profit, according to FT calculations.Berkshire Hathaway reported that its Apple bet was worth $135.4 billion, implying around 790 million shares. This marks a decline of around 13% in the stake. Apple was still Berkshire’s biggest holding by far at the end of the quarter. Buffett is said to be a big fan of Apple, and has called the company his favourite bet in the past.The reason for Berkshire Hathway cutting its stake is not known. Some speculations suggest it is for tax purposes. According to a report in CNBC, Buffett, while answering shareholder questions at Berkshire’s annual meeting in Omaha, suggested that the sale was for tax reasons following sizable gains. He also implied the sale could be tied to him wanting to avoid a higher tax bill down the road if rates go higher to fund a ballooning U.S. fiscal deficit.The Oracle of Omaha began trimming Berkshire’s Apple stake late last year, accelerating the process earlier this year. However, he maintained in May that the tech giant remained a core long-term investment alongside Coca-Cola and American Express.","Warren Buffet-led investment company slashed its Apple position by more than $50 billion to $84.2 billion in the second quarter.

Both previously worked at Google, with Shazeer co-authoring the groundbreaking ""Attention Is All You Need"" paper.However, the AI landscape has seen a talent exodus, with many paper co-authors departing to launch their own ventures.Character.AI will continue to operate independently under interim CEO Dominic Perella, assuring its user base. ""Our talented team remains dedicated to building the Character.AI platform and serving our growing community,"" the company stated.This deal underscores the fierce competition for AI talent and technology. Recent months have seen Microsoft and Amazon recruit key personnel from promising AI startups.For Google, the partnership signals a focus on regaining its footing in AI. The release of OpenAI's ChatGPT spurred internal concerns about being overtaken despite past breakthroughs. Google has since merged its AI labs into Google DeepMind , led by AI luminary Demis Hassabis.""We're thrilled to welcome Shazeer back,"" a Google spokesperson said. Shazeer will rejoin DeepMind with a select team. He expressed excitement about returning and collaborating with Google DeepMind while acknowledging Character.AI's achievements, ""I'm proud of what we built together."" He believes the Google partnership will ensure Character.AI's ""continued success."" Financial details remain undisclosed.Character.AI initially aimed to create a flexible AI platform for developing various services. Last year, the founders envisioned a future where everyone could access personalized AI companions.The platform allows users to create chatbots impersonating anyone – real or fictional. Millions of chatbots have been created, some becoming popular conversation partners. For example, a bot mimicking the Genshin Impact character Raiden Shogun has received over 371 million messages.Recently, Character.AI expanded beyond text, introducing ""Character Calls"" for phone calls with chatbots and ""Character Voice"" for generating custom voices.While a return to Google seemed unlikely last year, this partnership signals a new chapter in the AI race, with established players and rising stars collaborating to push the boundaries of the field.","Character.AI, known for its versatile chatbots, has announced a partnership with Google.

"Reliance Jio, Airtel and Vodafone-Idea 'unhappy' with Trai's new QoS rules; say overlook ground realities",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/reliance-jio-airtel-and-vodafone-idea-unhappy-with-trais-new-qos-rules-say-overlook-ground-realities/articleshow/112268723.cms,"COAI statement

COAI’s member Telecom Service Providers (TSPs) have consistently invested in enhancing Quality of Service (QoS) through significant improvements in network infrastructure, resulting in greater stability and reliability. The industry has embraced advanced technologies and automation tools, including predictive maintenance and AI-driven analytics, to proactively address network issues. Moreover, major initiatives are underway to fiberize towers across India, which is a crucial step for the efficient deployment of 5G services.

While TRAI has tightened the QoS benchmarks over the years, the ground realities remain unchanged. TSPs still grapple with Right of Way (RoW) issues when acquiring permissions for infrastructure deployment in public and private land for the installation of cell towers and fiber-optic cables. The situation is further aggravated due to additional requirement of street furniture for the 5G networks. Moreover, interference from various sources, such as other wireless devices and electromagnetic interference, degrade signal quality and network performance. Further, illegal boosters and repeaters used by unauthorised agents, as well as the cases of theft of equipment are also external factors which, nevertheless, impact the QoS. Besides, frequent takedown of the overhead fiber by the authorities have a significant impact in QoS as well. TSPs have limited control over these external sources which adversely impact the Quality of Services.

Despite these challenges, TSPs have consistently met TRAI's QoS benchmarks. The industry expresses concern over the proposed regulations, which not only tighten benchmarks but also shift from quarterly to monthly reporting and site to cell level reporting in many cases. In fact, the QoS parameters prescribed in the new Regulations have not been introduced by any other regulator in other similar economies. These changes are expected to significantly increase the compliance as well as the cost burden on telecom operators, and without commensurate benefits for the customers.

While we are disappointed with the stringency of these new regulations, we remain committed to engaging constructively with TRAI on QoS-related matters. Our member organizations will continue to strive for excellence in service quality while advocating for regulations that recognize the practical challenges faced by our industry.

What are the new QoS rules

The telecom industry has raised concerns over stringent new quality of service (QoS) norms introduced by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India ( Trai ). The Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), representing major telecom players -- Reliance Jio , Airtel and Vodafone-Idea -- argues that the regulations impose excessive burdens without addressing the challenges operators face on the ground.The new rules mandate stricter service quality benchmarks, increased penalties for non-compliance, and more frequent reporting requirements. Telecom operators must now compensate subscribers for outages exceeding 24 hours at the district level and face penalties of up to Rs 10 lakh for violations.However, COAI contends that these measures are impractical given ongoing hurdles such as right-of-way (RoW) issues for infrastructure deployment, interference from unauthorized devices, and theft of equipment. The industry body also highlights the impact of frequent fiber cuts and the additional demands of 5G network rollout. Despite these challenges, telecom operators have consistently met Trai's QoS benchmarks , according to COAI. The industry is seeking a more realistic approach that acknowledges the operational difficulties and avoids placing undue financial pressure on operators.Trai has issued new quality of service (QoS) rules, making it mandatory for telecom operators to compensate subscribers in case of service outages for more than 24 hours at a district level. Trai has also increased the penal amount to Rs 1 lakh from Rs 50,000 for failing to meet each quality benchmark under the new rules.The telecom regulator has introduced a graded penalty system of Rs 1 lakh, Rs 2 lakh, Rs 5 lakh and Rs 10 lakh for different scales of rule violations and submitting false report under revised regulations -- ""The Standards of Quality of Service of Access (Wirelines and Wireless) and Broadband (Wireline and Wireless) Service Regulations, 2024"".Trai has provided a six-month grace period for operators to align their systems with the new regulations.","The Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), representing major telecom players -- Reliance Jio, Airtel and Vodafone-Idea -- argues that the regulations impose excessive burdens.

"Intel to layoff over 15,000 employees: Read the memo shared by company’s CEO",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/intel-to-layoff-over-15000-employees-read-the-memo-shared-by-companys-ceo/articleshow/112211785.cms,"Here’s the full text of the memo shared by Intel CEO

Team,

We have moved our All Company Meeting to today, following our earnings call, as we are announcing significant actions to reduce our costs. We plan to deliver $10 billion in

cost savings

in 2025, and this includes reducing our head count by roughly 15,000 roles, or 15% of our workforce. The majority of these actions will be completed by the end of this year.

This is painful news for me to share. I know it will be even more difficult for you to read. This is an incredibly hard day for Intel as we are making some of the most consequential changes in our company’s history. When we meet in a few hours, I’ll talk about why we’re doing this and what you can expect in the coming weeks. In advance of that, I wanted to preview some of what’s on my mind.

Simply put, we must align our cost structure with our new operating model and fundamentally change the way we operate. Our revenues have not grown as expected – and we’ve yet to fully benefit from powerful trends, like AI. Our costs are too high, our margins are too low. We need bolder actions to address both – particularly given our financial results and outlook for the second half of 2024, which is tougher than previously expected.

These decisions have challenged me to my core, and this is the hardest thing I’ve done in my career. My pledge to you is that we will prioritize a culture of honesty, transparency and respect in the weeks and months to come.

Next week, we’ll announce a companywide enhanced retirement offering for eligible employees and broadly offer an application program for voluntary departures. I believe that how we implement these changes is just as important as the changes themselves, and we will adhere to Intel values throughout this process.

Why Now?

Since introducing our new operating model, we have taken a clean-sheet view of the business and assessed ourselves against benchmarks for high-performing foundries, fabless product companies and corporate functions. This work made it clear our cost structure is not competitive.

For example, our annual revenue in 2020 was about $24 billion higher than it was last year, yet our current workforce is actually 10% larger now than it was then. There are a lot of reasons for this, but it’s not a sustainable path forward.

Beyond our costs, we need to change the way we operate – something many of you shared as part of our Employee Experience Survey. There’s too much complexity, so we need to both automate and simplify processes. It takes too long for decisions to be made, so we need to eliminate bureaucracy. And there’s too much inefficiency in the system, so we need to expedite workflows.

Key Priorities

The actions we are taking will make Intel a leaner, simpler and more agile company. Let me highlight our areas of focus:

Reducing Operational Costs: We will drive companywide operational and cost efficiencies, including the cost savings and head count reductions mentioned above.

Simplifying Our Portfolio: We will complete actions this month to simplify our businesses. Each business unit is conducting a portfolio review and identifying underperforming products. We are also integrating key software assets into our business units so we accelerate our shift to systems-based solutions. And we will narrow our incubation focus on fewer, more impactful projects.

Eliminating Complexity: We will reduce layers, eliminate overlapping areas of responsibility, stop non-essential work, and foster a culture of greater ownership and accountability. For example, we will consolidate Customer Success into the Sales, Marketing and Communications Group to streamline our go-to-market motions.

Reducing Capital and Other Costs: With the completion of our historic five-nodes-in-four-years roadmap clearly in sight, we will review all active projects and equipment so we begin to shift our focus toward capital efficiency and more normalized spending levels. This will reduce our 2024 capital expenditures by more than 20%, and we plan to reduce our non-variable cost of goods sold by roughly $1 billion in 2025.

Suspending Our Dividend: We will suspend our stock dividend beginning next quarter to prioritize investments in the business and drive more sustained profitability.

Maintaining Growth Investments: Our IDM2.0 strategy is unchanged. Having fought hard to reestablish our innovation engine, we will maintain the key investments in our process technology and core product leadership.

The Future

I have no illusions that the path in front of us will be easy. You shouldn’t either. This is a tough day for all of us and there will be more tough days ahead. But as difficult as all of this is, we are making the changes necessary to build on our progress and usher in a new era of growth.

When we began this journey, we set our sights high, knowing that Intel is a place where big ideas are born and the power of what’s possible triumphs over the status quo. After all, our mission is to create world-changing technologies that improve the lives of every person on the planet. And at our best, we have exemplified these ideals more than any company in the world.

To live up to this mission, we must continue to drive our IDM 2.0 strategy, which remains the same: re-establish process technology leadership; invest in at-scale, globally resilient supply chain by expanding manufacturing capacity in the U.S. and EU; become a world-class, leading-edge foundry for internal and external customers; rebuild product portfolio leadership; and deliver AI Everywhere.

Over the past few years, we have rebuilt a sustainable innovation engine that is largely in place and on track. It’s now time to focus on building the sustainable financial engine needed to drive our performance. We must improve our execution, adapt to new market realities and operate as a more agile company. That’s the spirit of the actions we are taking – knowing that the choices we make today, as difficult as they are, will strengthen our ability to serve our customers and grow our business for years to come.

As we take these next steps in our journey, let’s not forget that there has never been a greater need for what we do. The world will increasingly run on silicon – and the world needs a healthy and vibrant Intel. That’s why the work we are doing is so consequential. Not only are we remaking a great company, but we are also creating technology and manufacturing capabilities that will reshape the world for decades to come. And this is something we should never lose sight of as we push forward in pursuit of our goals.

We’ll talk more in a few hours. Please come with your questions so we can have an open and honest discussion about what comes next.

NEW DELHI: A ransomware attack has forced the temporary shutdown of payment systems across nearly 300 small Indian local banks, according to reports. The customers of these banks have not been able to access payments services like withdrawing cash at ATMs or using United Payments Interface (UPI).The ransomware attack affected C-Edge Technologies , a provider of banking technology systems to small banks across the country, reports said.Other banking services are functioning normally, the officials told news agency PTI.In a statement released late in the evening, the national payments corporation of India (NPCI) said, ""C-Edge Technologies….has been possibly impacted by a ransomware attack impacting a few of their systems,"" leading to the temporary isolation of C-Edge from accessing NPCI-operated retail payment systems.Dileep Sanghani, chairman of the national cooperative union of India, told news agency PTI that nearly 300 banks in India, including 17 district cooperative banks in Gujarat, which rely on C-Edge, have been facing issues for the past two to three days.""All online transactions, such as RTGS and UPI payments, are affected.

30% of Gen-AI projects will be 'dumped' by the end of 2025 due to these reasons: Gartner,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/30-of-gen-ai-projects-will-be-dumped-by-the-end-of-2025-due-to-these-reasons-gartner/articleshow/112170259.cms,"What early adopters say

Calculating business impact

At least 30% of generative artificial intelligence ( GenAI ) projects will be abandoned after proof of concept by the end of 2025, due to poor data quality, inadequate risk controls, escalating costs or unclear business value, according to research company Gartner , Inc.Speaking at the Gartner Data & Analytics Summit in Sydney this week, Rita Sallam, distinguished VP analyst at Gartner said, “After last year's hype, executives are impatient to see returns on GenAI investments, yet organizations are struggling to prove and realize value.As the scope of initiatives widen, the financial burden of developing and deploying GenAI models is increasingly felt.”A major challenge for organizations arises in justifying the substantial investment in GenAI for productivity enhancement, which can be difficult to directly translate into financial benefit, according to Gartner. Many organizations are leveraging GenAI to transform their business models and create new business opportunities. However, these deployment approaches come with significant costs, ranging from $5 million to $20 million.“Unfortunately, there is no one size fits all with GenAI, and costs aren’t as predictable as other technologies,” said Sallam. “What you spend, the use cases you invest in and the deployment approaches you take, all determine the costs. Whether you’re a market disruptor and want to infuse AI everywhere, or you have a more conservative focus on productivity gains or extending existing processes, each has different levels of cost, risk, variability and strategic impact.”Regardless of AI ambition, Gartner research indicates GenAI requires a higher tolerance for indirect, future financial investment criteria versus immediate return on investment (ROI). Historically, many CFOs have not been comfortable with investing today for indirect value in the future. This reluctance can skew investment allocation to tactical versus strategic outcomes.Earlier adopters across industries and business processes are reporting a range of business improvements that vary by use case, job type and skill level of the worker. According to a recent Gartner survey, respondents reported 15.8% revenue increase, 15.2% cost savings and 22.6% productivity improvement on average. The survey of 822 business leaders was conducted between September and November 2023.“This data serves as a valuable reference point for assessing the business value derived from GenAI business model innovation,” said Sallam. “But it’s important to acknowledge the challenges in estimating that value, as benefits are very company, use case, role and workforce specific. Often, the impact may not be immediately evident and may materialize over time. However, this delay doesn’t diminish the potential benefits.”By analyzing the business value and the total costs of GenAI business model innovation, organizations can establish the direct ROI and future value impact, according to Gartner. This serves as a crucial tool for making informed investment decisions about GenAI business model innovation.“If the business outcomes meet or exceed expectations, it presents an opportunity to expand investments by scaling GenAI innovation and usage across a broader user base, or implementing it in additional business divisions,” said Sallam. “However, if they fall short, it may be necessary to explore alternative innovation scenarios. These insights help organizations strategically allocate resources and determine the most effective path forward.”","At least 30% of generative artificial intelligence projects will be abandoned after proof of concept by the end of 2025, according to research company Gartner.

The chip's packaging process reportedly remains unchanged, using Samsung 's FOPLP (Fan-Out Panel Level Packaging) technology.Interestingly, the report mentions that not all Tensor G4 devices may benefit from the new modem.
