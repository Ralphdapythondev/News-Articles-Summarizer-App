Why Microsoft has asked employees in China to stop using Android phones and only use iPhones at office,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-microsoft-has-asked-employees-in-china-to-stop-using-android-phones-and-only-use-iphones-at-office/articleshow/111593179.cms,"Only iPhones, no Android phones at work



Recent security incidents are behind this change

Microsoft is set to implement a significant cybersecurity measure in China, requiring all employees to use iPhones for work-related tasks and discontinuing the use of Android devices, according to an internal memo reviewed by Bloomberg News.Starting September, the tech giant will restrict corporate access from Android-powered devices in China, affecting hundreds of workers across the mainland.This decision is part of Microsoft's global Secure Future Initiative (SFI), aimed at standardising employee cybersecurity practices.The memo, as reported by Bloomberg, states that Chinese-based employees will soon be required to use only Apple devices for identity verification when logging into work computers or phones. This mandate highlights the growing divergence between Chinese and foreign mobile ecosystems, particularly in the fragmented landscape of Android app stores in China.Unlike Apple's iOS store, Google Play is not available in China, leading local smartphone makers like Huawei and Xiaomi to operate their own platforms. Microsoft's decision to block access from these devices stems from their lack of Google's mobile services in the country, according to the internal message.To make this transition easier, Microsoft will provide iPhone 15 devices as a one-time purchase to staff currently using Android handsets. The company plans to make these iPhones available for collection at various hubs across China, including Hong Kong, where Google's services are accessible.This move comes in the wake of increasing security concerns for Microsoft. Bloomberg reports that the company has faced repeated attacks from state-sponsored hackers, including a Russia-linked breach disclosed in January that affected dozens of US government agencies.In response to these challenges, Microsoft has pledged its most ambitious security overhaul in two decades through the SFI. Executive Vice President Charlie Bell emphasised in May that security has become the company's top priority, surpassing all other features.While Microsoft has not publicly addressed this specific policy change in China, it aligns with the company's broader efforts to enhance cybersecurity globally. These efforts include faster addressing of cloud vulnerabilities, strengthening credential protection, and enforcing multi factor authentication for employees.","Microsoft is set to implement a significant cybersecurity measure in China, requiring all employees to use iPhones for work-related tasks.

Aadit Palicha, co-founder and CEO of Zepto, a quick commerce platform in India, said that the company sees itself as a "" hyperlocal Walmart of India,"" according to a report in The Economic Times. Palicha believes that Zepto can realistically reach a topline of Rs 2.5 lakh crore in five years, focusing on the top 40 cities in the country.""We think of ourselves as a hyperlocal Walmart for a hyperlocal India...That was the big gap that helped us get to the scale and the level of profitability we've gotten to,"" Palicha said at an event in New Delhi, as reported by The Economic Times.While Zepto and competitors like Blinkit and Swiggy Instamart are expanding into categories like electronics and fashion, Palicha believes that groceries and household essentials hold the biggest opportunity. ""If you want to build a business that's larger than Amazon or Flipkart...grocery is bigger than all the categories that Amazon and Flipkart serve combined,"" he said. “If you take electronics, apparel, furniture and all the others – and double it, it’s still not as large as grocery and household essentials. So, we’re building in the mother of all categories,” he added.The grocery and household essentials segment in India is estimated at $650 billion and is projected to grow to $850 billion by FY29, according to Palicha. Zepto will focus on the top 40 cities, which are expected to make up for nearly half of the market by FY29.""Our focus is not really on the next 100 cities,"" Palicha said. ""From our perspective, if we execute well, we can realistically take this business from over Rs 10,000 crore in topline (gross merchandise value) today to Rs 2.5 lakh crore in topline over the next five years in the top 40 cities.""Zepto reportedly became the fastest company to reach $1 billion in GMV and maintains a growth rate exceeding 100% year-on-year. The company also aims to double its dark stores or micro-warehouses to 700 to compete with rivals like Blinkit, Instamart, and Tata Group 's BB Now.This comes after Zepto closed a $665 million funding round in June, valuing the company at $3.6 billion. ""In commerce generally, nobody has been able to build a hyperlocal platform at scale that has quality customer experience...and the reality is that most (of the) commerce in India is done on a hyperlocal basis,"" Palicha said according to The Economic Times.","Aadit Palicha, co-founder and CEO of Zepto, a quick commerce platform in India, said that the company sees itself as a "" hyperlocal Walmart of India"" He believes the company can realistically reach a topline of Rs 2.5 lakh crore in five years, focusing on the top 40 cities.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111586751,imgsize-2847045,width-400,resizemode-4/111586751.jpg"
Google Maps test new feature to promote sponsored businesses,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-maps-test-new-feature-to-promote-sponsored-businesses/articleshow/111585873.cms,"How Google is showing these sponsored stops



Google Maps has started a new test that will suggest sponsored stops to drivers. A user named Anthony Higman took to social media platform X (earlier Twitter) to reveal the existence of the feature and shared how it works. The X post (first seen by PhoneArena) claims that the Google Maps app may now suggest pitstops at businesses that pay to advertise on the app, even if they aren't on the driver’s route.Higman reported being directed to Royal Farms with a low rating of 2.9.Another user named Mike Blumenthal also commented on the post showing how Google Maps misdirected him with a sponsored pitstop.As per the report, these pop-up ads seem to be completely random, unlike most online ads that consider the user’s search history. It's like having random billboards shoved in the face while you're trying to focus on the road.Apart from this, the pop-ups may also turn out to be dangerous. They appear while driving and require interaction (tapping ""Cancel"" or ""Add stop"") which can distract the driver from the road, especially if they are relying on audio navigation. These pop-ads can be highly distractive, especially to new and inexperienced drivers.The report also claims that Google may have lifted this idea from its subsidiary Waze , which is allegedly only supposed to show sponsored suggestions when your vehicle is not moving. However, some users have reported that it’s not the case.The report didn’t reveal whether this feature is in testing or will be made available for all users soon. One of the X users who reported the problem has also declared that he will stop using the app if he gets sponsored suggestions every time he is driving.Meanwhile, another X user mentioned that it could be a good way to discover new places to go to.","A user named Anthony Higman took to social media platform X (earlier Twitter) to reveal the existence of the feature and shared how it works.

Chinese researchers develop AI-powered robot with ‘artificial’ brain,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/chinese-researchers-develop-ai-powered-robot-with-artificial-brain/articleshow/111585537.cms,"What researchers said about the technology



What are brain organoids



Scientists in China have made a significant breakthrough in artificial intelligence (AI) by reportedly creating a robot which is powered by a lab-grown, artificial brain . This brain-on-chip technology reportedly utilises human stem cells to develop a simplified brain-like structure that controls the robot.According to a report by the South China Morning Post, researchers were successfully able to program the robot to perform basic tasks such as avoiding obstacles and grasping objects using a neural interface chip .This innovation represents a significant leap forward in brain-computer interfaces ( BCI ), a field aiming to merge brain activity with external computing power.BCI has become a trending topic, with companies like Elon Musk's Neuralink introducing implantable chips for controlling devices with the mind.Researchers at Tianjin University said that it is “the world’s first open-source brain-on-chip intelligent complex information interaction system” and may lead to the development of brain-like computing.In a statement to the state-owned Science and Technology Daily, the vice president of Tianjin University, Ming Dong said: “[This] is a technology that uses an in-vitro cultured ‘brain’ – such as brain organoids– coupled with an electrode chip to form a brain-on-chip,” which encodes and decodes stimulation feedback.The research at Tianjin University holds promise for the creation of a new era of hybrid human-robot intelligence .Brain organoids are tiny clumps of brain-like tissue. They're made from special cells that can turn into many different types of cells. These cells are usually only found in very young embryos.These scientists have put these brain organoids into real brains. They found that the organoids could connect and work with the real brain tissue.The scientists wrote about this in an unedited manuscript published in the peer-reviewed Oxford University Press journal Brain last month.“The transplant of human brain organoids into living brains is a novel method for advancing organoid development and function. Organoid grafts have a host-derived functional vasculature system and exhibit advanced maturation,” the team wrote.",Researchers at Tianjin University have created a robot powered by a brain-on- chip.

Samsung workers go on 3-day strike in South Korea: This is what they are demanding,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/samsung-workers-go-on-3-day-strike-in-south-korea-this-is-what-they-are-demanding/articleshow/111584869.cms,"Why union workers are protesting against Samsung

Union on alleged low turnout in strike

Samsung workers on Monday (July 8) have begun a three-day strike in South Korea , with the union alleging that the country’s biggest conglomerate continues to fall short of its demands. The tech company, however, said that there was no disruption in production.The National Samsung Electronics Union (NSEU), which has roughly 30,000 members and make up almost a quarter of the firm's South Korean workforce, has put three demands.The workers have demanded better pay along with an extra day of annual leave for unionised workers as well as changes to the employee bonus system . They allege that bonuses for rank-and-file workers are calculated by deducting the cost of capital from operating profit, whereas those for executives are based on personal performance goals.The union said 6,540 workers will be striking this week, mostly at manufacturing sites and in product development, as per news agency Reuters.In the first industrial action last month, the union coordinated annual leave to stage a mass walkout. As per union officials, nearly 3,000 strikers attended a rally near Samsung's headquarters in Hwaseong, Seoul. Samsung, however, said that it had no impact on business activity.Union president Son Woo-mok disputed media reports of low participation, and told the news agency that the union did not have enough time to educate members about the issues.“Education about labour unions ... has not been enough. But I don't think this participation is low because our union is still young compared to other unions,” he said. Meanwhile, the union's vice president hinted of more strikes if Samsung does not improve its proposals.He said that Samsung's proposals include flexibility in pay and annual leave conditions but do not meet union demands of increased pay and leave.","National Samsung Electronics Union (NSEU) has roughly 30,000 members and make up almost a quarter of the firm's South Korean workforce.

Apple MacBook Pro models with M4 chipsets: What to expect



Apple is expected to launch new MacBook Pro and MacBook Air models in the coming months. According to a report by Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, the rumoured MacBook Pro and MacBook Air machines are likely to come powered by three variants of Apple’s M4 chipsets -- the base M4, M4 Pro and M4 Max chipsets. The report also notes that the upgraded MacBooks may retain their predecessor's designs and may even offer new features through an AI subscription service which is expected to boost sales.Rumours suggest that Apple will soon release 14-inch and 16-inch models of MacBook Pros with M4 chips by the end of this year or early next year. Moreover, MacBook Air sizes are also in line for an early 2025 refresh.Currently, the only Apple devices with the M4 chip are the newest iPad Pro models . The most affordable option is the 11-inch iPad Pro with 256GB of storage which was launched at Rs 99,900.Gurman claims that both the MacBook Pro and MacBook Air won't see any design changes despite getting upgraded to the M4 chipsets. This comes after the 2021 redesign of the MacBook Pro with the M1 chip.He also suggested that a more significant visual overhaul might be coming in 2026, potentially coinciding with the adoption of OLED displays similar to the latest iPad Pro models.Similarly, the MacBook Air is also expected to wait until 2027 for a design refresh, five years after it departs from the wedge shape.Gurman acknowledges that a chip upgrade alone might not be enough to entice existing MacBook users to upgrade.To address this, Apple is reportedly considering a monthly subscription service that builds upon the free Apple Intelligence launching this fall.Additionally, Gurman claims Apple might integrate and potentially take a commission on third-party AI services like ChatGPT, mirroring their App Store model.",Apple is expected to launch new MacBook Pro and MacBook Air models in the coming months.

Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max may offer longer battery life,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/mobiles-tabs/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-may-offer-longer-battery-life/articleshow/111411018.cms,"Apple to use steel battery case to tackle overheating

Apple iPhone 16 series rumours

Apple iPhone 16 series is expected to launch in September and in the run up to the debut, the rumour mill is already churning out scores of leaks. According to another such leak, iPhone 16 Pro Max is expected to get a boost in battery life .Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has said that the Cupertino-based giant is increasing the energy density of the battery cells of iPhone 16 Pro Max, which will result in longer battery life.“My latest supply chain survey indicates the energy density (Wh/kg) of the battery cells of iPhone 16 Pro Max will increase, which has the benefit of longer battery life with the same battery size or lower battery size with the same battery life,” he said in a post.However, with increase in energy density of the battery cells, there will be an increase in temperature when running. To tackle this, Apple will use the stainless steel battery case .“Increasing the energy density of the battery cells will increase the battery temperature when running. To avoid overheating the battery, Apple uses the stainless steel battery case for the first time as a thermal solution ,” Kuo said.While stainless steel may not be as effective as aluminium in dissipating heat, “it is more robust and less susceptible to corrosion, so in addition to dissipating heat, the stainless steel battery case provides better protection for the battery and the iPhone system.”Kuo noted that the use of a stainless steel battery case will reduce the difficulty of removing the battery, hence, helping Apple to “comply with the European Union’s requirements for mobile phone batteries’ replaceability in the future.”“If the mass production of this new battery design (upgraded energy density of battery cells & adoption of the stainless steel battery case) goes well and the feedback is favourable, this new battery design will be adopted in all 2H25 new iPhone models,” Kuo noted.The iPhone 16 series is rumoured to replace physical buttons with touch-sensitive buttons that simulate a press with haptic feedback. The camera layout might shift to a vertical design, unlike the current diagonal setup. The customisable Action button, currently on Pro models, might be available on all iPhone 16 models.Under the hood, the standard iPhone 16 and Plus models might use the A18 chip , while Pro models could get the A18 Pro chip. Meanwhile, the display size for iPhone 16 and Plus (6.1-inch and 6.7-inch) might remain the same, but the refresh rate could improve.","iPhone 16 Pro Max is expected to get a boost in battery life.
