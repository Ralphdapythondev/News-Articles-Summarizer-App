TCS sees headcount fall first time in 19 years

India's largest IT services company Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is facing a significant challenge filling a massive number of open positions. During a town hall earlier this month, the global operations head of TCS ' resource management group (RMG) Amar Shetye revealed that the company currently has thousands of open positions that it is not able to fill due to the skills gap.Shetye put the number at 80,000. For those unaware, the RMG team at TCS is responsible for allocation of available resources to various projects across the company and in case of any shortfall, fill such requirements through contractors. These contractors are on the roles of the hiring agencies and may or may not be hired as permanent staff by the company.The reason for the skills gap is said to be a mismatch between the skills possessed by employees and the roles in demand.An employee who attended the townhall anonymously told TOI, ""We were told that either skillsets or employee aspirations are not matching project requirements. However, at TCS, no associate is forced to take on a project if they are not comfortable with it."" Another employee on the bench added, ""He told us that we should consider ourselves fortunate that the firm is not laying off employees for not being mapped to any project unlike other firms."" The company’s recent annual report revealed that 33% of job requirements are currently being met by grooming existing talent.Post the announcement of fourth quarter results, TCS CEO K Krithivasan said that the company has built one of the largest artificial-intelligence-ready workforces in the world. ""TCS is currently working over 200 engagements in GenAI with our clients and foresees a promising pipeline of future work across all industries,"" he wrote.TCS posted strong performance in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 2024-25. ""This is a quarter of strong deals and execution for us. Continuous focus on operational excellence helped us achieve a 26% operating margin."" The management also said that deal wins were ""across markets, industries and geographies.""The Mumbai-headquartered company said that it had signed new deals totalling $13.2 billion in the fourth quarter, which is one of the highest ever for the company even as it signalled a cautious turnaround for the industry. The company added that the pain may be bottoming out and FY25 will be better than FY24.TCS's Gen-AI deal pipeline is said to have touched $900 million. “Our Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) pipeline has surged to $900 million, marking a doubling in value. The Total Contract Value (TCV) of the deal comprises primarily standard-sized deals, with the exception of a significant win secured in Q3,"" the company said in its earnings report.TCS' full year headcount fell for the first time in 19 years. The company reported a quarter-on-quarter decline of 1,759 in its headcount for the fourth quarter of FY2024-25. TCS concluded the fourth quarter with a workforce totaling 601,546 employees, with women comprising 35.6% of the total.",India's largest IT services company Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is facing a significant challenge filling a massive number of open positions.

Why laid-off Paytm employees have filed complaints with labour ministry,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-laid-off-paytm-employees-have-filed-complaints-with-labour-ministry/articleshow/111175333.cms,"What laid-off employees have to say



Paytm founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma’s job cuts warning



Several Paytm employees who have been laid off have reportedly filed complaints with the ministry of labour and employment alleging that the fintech company has made ""unlawful termination"" without proper compensation. The complaints, filed between June 1 and June 12, seek reinstatement.Moneycontrol said that it accessed a copy of the filed complaint on the ministry's Samandhan portal and the same has been also verified by an official.The complaints claim that the Paytm management conducted unfair and unethical termination practices. Employees have also included supporting documents, including emails and official records with the complaints. While the report hasn’t revealed the exact number of complaints, some claim that it could be around 50.While some ex-employees said that they are waiting for a response from the ministry, a few others said that they were forced to resign.“We are awaiting a response from the Ministry and hope the case will be taken up by them. If not satisfactory, will take the court route,” said one of the employees, who claimed to have been terminated by Paytm without compensation or justification.Some employees have alleged being forced to ""voluntarily resign"".“My HRBP reached out to me yesterday (June 20) saying if I don’t resign by 12pm today (June 21), I will be terminated. I will take up the legal route as soon as possible. A few others are planning to do the same while some are already in the process,” another one said.In a letter to its shareholders last month, Paytm founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma acknowledged the company's first-ever sales decline. As per Sharma, the company is implementing cost-cutting measures targeting employee expenses, aiming to save Rs 400-500 crore annually.""One97 Communications Limited (OCL) is providing outplacement support to employees which have resigned as a part of the restructuring efforts by the company,” the company previously said.“As we harness AI capabilities and enhance governance structures, we are fully committed towards building our business according to regulatory compliances,” the Paytm letter added.Sharma also noted that the company will move forward with a “leaner organisation structure.” Apart from suggesting job cuts, Paytm also said that it will trim its non-core assets.","Several Paytm employees who have been laid off have reportedly filed complaints with the ministry of labour and employment.

Navigating intellectual property challenges in India’s electronic gaming industry,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/navigating-intellectual-property-challenges-in-indias-electronic-gaming-industry/articleshow/111174454.cms,"By: Dr. Abhimanyu Chopra (Partner) and Mr. Kushagra Jain (Associate) of AZB and Partners.

The Indian gaming industry , valued at $3.49 billion, has witnessed remarkable growth, drawing in start-ups and over 900 MSMEs. In the Indian context, the games have evolved from a simple game of dice, which is most fondly remembered in the tale of Mahabharata, to more nuanced skill and transparency-based features. To illustrate by example, some operators have come up with Patented processes to ensure trust and transparency.Despite India's burgeoning gaming market and the surge in developers, a key challenge lies in the perception battle, where skill-based real money games are often mistaken for gambling, hindering their protection. Legal differentiation hinges on skill's impact on outcomes, affirmed by the Supreme Court in cases like State of Andhra Pradesh v K. Satyanarayana & Ors., State of Bombay v R.M.D. Chamarbaugwala and K.R. Lakshmanan v. State of Tamil Nadu. Such games are exempt from gambling laws (Public Gambling Act) and recognized as legitimate business activities under Article 19(1)(g) of the Indian Constitution.The Indian jurisprudence is pretty well-established concerning games of skill vis-à-vis games of chance, whether played online or offline. However, this article is limited to the aspects of intellectual property concerning these games.The present Indian landscape lacks direct intellectual property protections concerning electronic/video games, being complex compositions of various artistic and technical elements such as character designs, backgrounds, soundtracks, narratives, game codes etc, which not only take years of development and planning, but humongous resources and capital to develop and distribute. It may be noted that the electronic/video games industry faces not only challenges in the realm of creating original narratives/content but also in the absence of codified/specific legislation encompassing the intricacies of the elements of the games, face a myriad of challenges such as game cloning and digital piracy, which lead to unauthorized distribution and replication/reverse engineering of popular games and infringement of their intellectual property. The skill-based games are centred around unique elements which call upon its users to exercise their mental skill, superior learning and adroitness, and these features require sweat and hard work of the author and creator.In India, the absence of specific regulations for the gaming industry leaves video games uncategorized under intellectual property law. While trademark law can protect the name, characters’ unique identity, symbol etc. of the game, it still leaves a wide array of intellectual property elements unshielded. The software industry has tackled this challenge of infringement by replacing serial numbers and keys with login credentials, thereby, making the gaming software the service, however, with limited success, especially in the context of electronic/video games given the aspect of jail-breaking, side-loading, pirated version with ease, which in the view of the authors are currently protected in a very curtailed and limited manner in the copyright regime.The courts in India have underscored the necessity of comprehensive copyright protection for all elements of a game, including the musical works, characters and storylines within the games, and the requirement of sound and proper licensing agreements. Yet, there are only a handful of cases such as NS Bedi vs NHAI, where the audio-visual element comprising of the unique user interface in a traffic simulation game was conferred copyright protection by the court, or the widely-quoted case of Sony Computer Entertainment Europe Ltd vs. Harmeet Singh where the Delhi High Court issued an interim injunction against defendants for copyright infringement for modifying PlayStation systems to enable pirated games and selling pirated games without a license.In Mattel Inc. and Ors. v. Jayant Agarwalla, the Delhi High Court set a high threshold for copyright infringement, requiring originality beyond mere arrangement or colour changes of tiles. Citing Eastern Book Company & Ors. v. D.B. Modak & Anr., the Court emphasized the need for judgment and ability in creative works. It discussed the merger concept, highlighting that protecting one expression of an idea could constrain freedom of expression if limited possibilities exist.In conclusion, the ongoing development of copyright and intellectual property laws is crucial for sustaining the growth and innovation of electronic and video games. This can be best achieved through specialized legislation that integrates patents, copyrights, and trademarks in a tailored approach. This would address current needs, ensuring novelty, originality, and advancement, while also encouraging investment.","In India, the absence of specific regulations for the gaming industry leaves video games uncategorized under intellectual property law.

The joint venture – formed by Aditya Birla Group and UK’s Vodafone Group Plc – raised investment by participating in an Rs 18,000 crore follow-on public offer (FPO), contributing Rs 2,075 crore themselves.The third-largest telecom player in India said that these funds will be directed towards network expansion and the crucial rollout of 5G services. The company sees the delay in adoption of 5G as an opportunity to deploy the technology in a cost-efficient manner.Vi has also been losing customers as it is unable to offer 5G to users.

The average data consumed by 4G subscribers grew by 2.3% to 15.44 GB.“We have shut down 3G completely in 6 circles with Kerala getting added to the list of 5 other circles; namely Maharashtra, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Mumbai and Kolkata where 3G spectrum is completely refarmed to 4G,” the company said.“Our 4G network covers over 1 billion Indians. We have completed minimum rollout obligations for 5G in 4 circles of Maharashtra, Delhi, Tamil Nadu, and Punjab,” the statement added.

Amazon may make this Alexa feature paid,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/amazon-may-make-this-alexa-feature-paid/articleshow/111173278.cms,"When “Remarkable Alexa” will be launched

Amazon is planning a significant overhaul for Alexa by including generative AI capabilities into the voice assistant, a report has said, adding that the company may introduce a two-tiered structure to use the service. While the e-commerce giant hasn’t said anything about the pricing, the report claims that the company may introduce a subscription for $5.Citing sources familiar with the project, news agency Reuters reports that Amazon may charge a monthly subscription fee of around $5 for access to a more advanced version of the AI. This premium tier would likely offer enhanced capabilities compared to the current, free version of Alexa.This may mean that the new Alexa won't be bundled with the popular Prime membership. Amazon is also reported to be calling the new voice assistant “Remarkable Alexa”.Amazon is also said to be working to replace “Classic Alexa,” which is the current version available to user for free, with an AI-powered one for which people may have to pay at least $5 per month to access. Some of the people also told the Reuters that Amazon has also considered a $10-per-month price.Three sources told the news agency that Amazon has given employees a deadline of August to prepare the newest version of Alexa and CEO Andy Jassy is said to be overlooking the developments. In an April letter to shareholders, Jassy talked about a “more intelligent and capable Alexa.” However, Amazon’s plans for Alexa including pricing and release dates could be altered or cancelled.“We have already integrated generative AI into different components of Alexa, and are working hard on implementation at scale—in the over half a billion ambient, Alexa-enabled devices already in homes around the world—to enable even more proactive, personal, and trusted assistance for our customers,” an Amazon spokeswoman was quoted as saying.Sources familiar with the company's plans say senior management has emphasised the potential of Alexa with conversational AI capabilities to generate meaningful sales for Amazon.Amazon has been looking to keep up with rivals – Google, Microsoft and ChatGPT maker OpenAI – in the generative AI space.

Kaspersky ban in US comes into effect in July

The US government has banned the sale of Kaspersky antivirus software in the country citing security concerns. The ban will come into effect from next month. In addition, three units of Kaspersky will be added to a trade restriction list, which effectively bars a company's U.S. suppliers from selling to it. As per sources, the sale of white-labeled products - that integrate Kaspersky into software sold under a different brand name - will also be barred.Imposing the ‘first of its kind’ ban, the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security said that the software poses national security and privacy risks due to the company's Russian origins.“Russia has shown it has the capacity, and even more than that, the intent to exploit Russian companies like Kaspersky to collect and weaponize the personal information of Americans. And that’s why we are compelled to take the action that we’re taking today,” U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said.Kaspersky will be banned from selling its softwares in the US to individual customers as well as businesses starting July 20.Raimondo said that consumers who are already using Kaspersky's antivirus are not violating the law. Existing customers will be eligible for software and security updates till September 29, she stated.“That means your software and services will degrade. That’s why I strongly recommend that you immediately find an alternative to Kaspersky,” Raimpondo added.Trump administration banned Kaspersky from federal networksIn 2017, the then Trump administration banned Kaspersky’s flagship antivirus product from federal networks.

Melinda stepped from Gates foundation after the divorce

Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates divorced his ex-wife Melinda French Gates in 2021. Years later, Melinda French Gates has opened up about her divorce. In an interview with Time Magazine recently, she described the end of 27-years marriage as ‘a painful and horrible experience’.“Getting a divorce is a horrible thing. It’s just painful. It’s awful when you realize you need one,” she said. Although later she corrected horrible to hard, but added that things are wonderful now that it’s over.During the interview, Melinda Gates also talked about how getting divorced in a pandemic helped the couple get privacy. “It gave us the privacy to do what needed to be done in private,"" she told Time.She also reflected on being able to navigate the process while taking care of children. “You know, I separated first before I made the full decision about a divorce. And to be able to do that in private while I’m still trying to take care of the kids, while still making certain decisions about how you’re going to disentangle your life - thank God,"" she said.The divorce led her to step away from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in May this year, three years after the divorce. During the interview, she told Time that she thought about the effect of divorce on the foundation.""I thought a lot about my three children. But I certainly thought about the effect on the foundation. Those are the three biggest buckets: me, the kids, and the foundation. And I wanted to make sure that when we came through it to the other side - all of those pieces were intact.”Melinda also explained that she does not see her decision to exit the foundation as ‘downsizing’. “I don’t see it honestly as a downsizing ...I was just ready to be able to have full decision-making control about where all the funds go,” she said.","Melinda French Gates divorced her husband Bill Gates in 2021.

What the Apple Store will offer

Apple is all set to launch its first store in Malaysia , Apple The Exchange TRX, located in Kuala Lumpur 's Tun Razak Exchange business district. The yet-to-open store features a unique glass dome-like design.“Emitting a warm glow at night, the three-dimensional layered roof consists of horizontal glass panels and shading blades to reduce the sun’s rays. A central glazed oculus brings daylight into the interior and includes a dynamic artificial-lighting feature,” said the company.Inside the store, a sculptural quartz and glass staircase connects the three levels where customers can explore, learn, and shop. The Forum, home to Today at Apple programming, is located on a floating deck that joins up with the mall, while the upper level directly connects with the edge of the park, bringing daylight and greenery into the store through a continuous glass façade.The store runs on 100 percent renewable energy and is designed using high-quality materials, including natural stone walls, polished stainless-steel columns, light terrazzo floors, and a timber ceiling.Apple has announced that the store will open for customers on Saturday (June 22). “To celebrate the opening, a special Today at Apple series, “Jom Discover,” will run from Saturday, June 22, through Saturday, July 6. Bringing together some of Malaysia’s most celebrated creators, the sessions will offer a glimpse into the creative process while showcasing Apple’s full range of products and services,” said the company in a release.The Malaysian Apple Store has more than 160 employees and the customers will be able to shop for their favourite Apple products — from the iPhone 15 lineup to the MacBook Air with M3 and the latest iPad models, including the redesigned iPad Air and incredibly thin iPad Pro with M4.","Apple is all set to launch its first store in Malaysia, Apple The Exchange TRX, located in Kuala Lumpur's Tun Razak Exchange business district.

Apple Intelligence launch in China may face these three ‘challenges’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-intelligence-launch-in-china-may-face-these-three-challenges/articleshow/111147927.cms,"Tough rules for AI models

Ban on ChatGPT, which will be integrated in Apple devices

Privacy, a core focus for Apple

China has tough rules for AI models

Ban on OpenAI’s ChatGPT in China

Private Cloud Compute

Apple has announced Apple Intelligence , a suite of AI features that will run on iPhones, iPads and Mac PCs. The AI features will be available later this year to users globally, including China – one the most critical markets for the company. However, the company’s big AI push may face some challenges in China as regulators have in place strict rules around the technology amid tough competition.The three challenges that the company may face in China are (via CNBC):China’s AI market is tightly regulated and all companies launching AI models must have approval from the regulators for the commercial use of LLMs. The country has also made it mandatory for Generative AI providers to take down “illegal” content.Since some of the features of Apple Intelligence are developed by the company itself, Apple will likely need to get its AI model approved by authorities under Chinese rules.China has also banned OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Some of Apple’s voice assistant Siri’s capabilities are dependent on ChatGPT. This could mean that Apple may have to find a local AI company that provides the same level of capabilities as ChatGPT. Baidu and Alibaba are among China’s technology giants that have their own LLMs and voice assistants.Apple's AI launch highlighted a focus on user privacy. Their new system, Private Cloud Compute, processes user data on Apple-owned servers, with the company claiming the data itself is not stored.However, in China, Apple's iCloud data is stored on servers located locally and operated by a third party. This may raise concerns about whether Apple can maintain complete control over its AI computing servers in the country.This means that Apple must have a similar partnership for its AI servers in the region to keep user data private.","Apple has announced Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI features that will run on iPhones, iPads and Mac PCs.

What is UPI Lite and why bank are pushing it



How to register for email to receive all the UPI transaction alerts



Starting June 25, HDFC Bank will stop sending text alerts for low-value UPI transactions. This means that HDFC Bank customers will receive SMS alerts for UPI transactions exceeding Rs 100 when sending money and similar notification for when received is above Rs 500. However, the bank will continue to send email alerts for all transactions with no absolutely change.In a mail as well as SMS alert sent to its customers, HDFC Bank said: “Starting from 25th June, 2024: Email Alerts: Continue to receive email alerts for all UPI transactions. SMS Notifications: Now only for transactions above Rs 100 (money sent/paid) and Rs 500 (money received).”This change aligns with banking norms, which require text messages for transactions over Rs 5,000. Despite this, many banks send alerts for lower-value debits as well. HDFC Bank stated that feedback indicated alerts for low-value transactions were deemed 'not useful,' as there is often duplication of notifications from UPI payment apps.Bankers noted that bulk text messages cost between Rs 0.01-0.03 each. With UPI transactions averaging around 40 crores per day, banks collectively spend several crores daily on text message alerts.Banks are also promoting the use of UPI Lite for transactions up to Rs 500. UPI Lite allows a small amount of money to be set aside by the app, facilitating quick payments without the need for second-factor authentication.By reducing the frequency of low-value transaction alerts, HDFC Bank and others aim to streamline notifications for customers while also cutting costs. This shift is expected to enhance the user experience and encourage the adoption of UPI Lite for smaller transactions.However, users can register their email with HDFC bank to receive messages of all the UPI transactionsStep 1: Click on https://instaservices.hdfcbank.com/?journey=107&source_type=103Step 2: Enter the registered mobile numberStep 3: Identify using DoB or PAN or Customer ID and click on Get OTP.","HDFC Bank will stop sending text alerts for low-value UPI transactions.
