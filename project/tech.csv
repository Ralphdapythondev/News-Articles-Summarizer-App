Princess Diana's iconic dresses put on display in Hong Kong ahead of auction,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/princess-dianas-iconic-dresses-put-on-display-in-hong-kong-ahead-of-auction/articleshow/109404208.cms,"(With agency inputs)

NEW DELHI: Princess Diana 's iconic dresses were put on display in Hong Kong ahead of an upcoming auction by Julien’s. Notable among them was a radiant daffodil yellow suit, complete with shoulder pads and adorned with shimmering gold buttons, famously worn during her visit to the former British colony in 1989. This suit, along with five additional outfits, is currently on display at a Hong Kong mall for a 12-day exhibition.Subsequently, the collection will travel to Ireland for another exhibition before being put up for auction.Outfits and accessories, curated under ""Princess Diana's Elegance & A Royal Collection"" is set to be auctioned online by Julien's, the renowned Hollywood auction house, on June 27.According to Martin Nolan, executive director of Julien's Auctions, Princess Diana made a fashion statement every time she stepped out. The yellow suit, designed by Catherine Walker, is estimated to fetch up to $50,000, while a midnight blue star-embellished tulle gown she wore to the 1986 ""Phantom of the Opera"" premiere is expected to bring in $400,000.Visitors to the exhibit, which opened on Thursday, had the opportunity to explore the history behind each outfit. Recalling Diana's visit to Hong Kong in 1989, elderly shopper surnamed Fung said, ""Diana was charismatic, caring and devoted to charity. That's why a lot of Hong Kongers respected her.""Other notable items in the exhibit include a silk and lace evening dress designed by Victor Edelstein and a pink floral Catherine Walker dress worn by Diana in 1991 during a bedside vigil for a close friend.Martin Nolan described these pieces as ""tangible assets and great conversation pieces,"" highlighting Diana's enduring relatability even decades after her tragic death. Last year, Julien's Auctions sold one of Diana's evening dresses for $1.14 million, indicating continued interest from collectors.For younger generations, Diana remains a significant figure in pop culture, possibly influenced by Netflix's series ""The Crown."" The exhibit, according to experts, has the ability to intertwine fashion and history, suggesting a resurgence of Diana's style in contemporary fashion trends.","Princess Diana's iconic dresses were put on display in Hong Kong ahead of an upcoming auction by Julien’s.

AI tool predicts when recruits will quit jobs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/ai-tool-predicts-when-recruits-will-quit-jobs/articleshow/109436849.cms,"Bosses worried about turnover or wondering how long a new hire will stick around can now turn to AI for a heads-up on who might be next out the door.The artificial intelligence tool was developed by Japanese researchers to try and help managers provide targeted support to staff to stop them from quitting.It crunches data on employees at a company, from their attendance record to personal information such as age and gender, and was created by Tokyo City University professor Naruhiko Shiratori with a start-up based in the Japanese capital.The tool also analyses data on employees who left the company, or took a leave of absence, to create a turnover model for each firm.Then when fed data on new recruits, it predicts who is at risk of quitting ""in percentage points"", Shiratori, a media education expert, told AFP on Friday.""We are currently testing the AI tool with several companies, creating a model for each one.""Bosses could use the results to ""suggest to the high-risk employee -- without showing a raw figure, which could be shocking to him or her -- that the company is ready to offer support, because AI suggested they may be facing difficulties"", Shiratori said.To create the tool, the researchers built on a previous study using AI to predict the characteristics of university students likely to drop out.Now they are planning an upgrade so that the AI tool can suggest suitable assignments for new employees by analysing information from job interviews, as well as their characteristics and personal histories.Japanese businesses traditionally all hire graduates at the same time each year, but about one in 10 recruits fresh from college quit their jobs within a year, government data shows.Around 30 percent leave their company within three years, according to the labour ministry.","Artificial intelligence tool crunches data on employees at a company.

Why Samsung Galaxy S22 users in India and other countries may need to upgrade their smartphones,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/mobiles-tabs/why-samsung-galaxy-s22-users-in-india-and-other-countries-may-need-to-upgrade-their-smartphones/articleshow/109447808.cms,"How do older Galaxy S-series phones compare against newer models in Asia



Samsung Galaxy S22 users may soon need to upgrade their devices to current generation models. According to early findings from Ookla’s Speedtest Intelligence report, the latest Galaxy S24 models have outperformed their predecessors, especially S22 models in terms of 5G speed across several of countries. The report noted that while differences in speed between devices were minimal in some countries, Galaxy S24 models showed significant speed advantages over previous-generation Samsung devices in Asian markets India, South Korea, Thailand and others.As per the report, new as well as older models of the Samsung Galaxy S series showed strong performance in India. The newer models led for both 5G download speeds and 5G multi-server latency. While 5G speeds impressed across all generation models in the country.The Galaxy S24 models posted the top median 5G download speed at 302.43 Mbps and the lowest median 5G multi-server latency at 41.56 ms. On the other hand, Galaxy S22 devices showed the slowest speeds in India at 273.78 Mbps, while the Samsung Galaxy S23 was just slightly behind at 279.93 Mbps.Meanwhile, the iPhone 15 family, clocked in with a median 5G download speed of 285.78 Mbps.The report suggests consumers in India currently using S22 devices might want to upgrade to an S24 model. In this study, the new devices provided a nearly 30 Mbps speed advantage.However, with good 5G speeds across devices of all generations and similar speeds for devices in the Galaxy S22, S23 and iPhone 15 families, users may not feel a huge difference in their 5G experience from one device to another.In Hong Kong, the latest Galaxy S24 family performed particularly well and boasted a median 5G download speed of 165.74 Mbps and the lowest median 5G multi-server latency in the market at 21.74 ms.However, the S24’s median 5G download speed was statistically comparable to that of its older Samsung and iPhone 15 rivals. This makes choosing to upgrade more about new features than about performance.In Japan, Samsung devices offered similar 5G download speeds across older as well as the latest models.Meanwhile, in Indonesia, the Galaxy S23 models offered faster download speeds. Also, the speed offered by the iPhone 15 models was nearly 25 Mbps faster than its Samsung peers, the report added.In the Philippines, the latest Galaxy S24 models offered 20 Mbps and 15 Mbps faster speeds over S22 and S23 devices, respectively. However, 5G speeds offered by iPhone 15 models in this region were significantly lower than its Samsung rivals.Apart from this, in South Korea and Thailand, Samsung Galaxy S24 and iPhone 15 offered much faster 5G download speeds.","Latest Galaxy S24 models have outperformed their predecessors, especially S22 models in terms of 5G speed across several of countries.

OnePlus may soon launch its first-ever flip foldable phone: What to expect,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/mobiles-tabs/oneplus-may-soon-launch-its-first-ever-flip-foldable-phone-what-to-expect/articleshow/109447674.cms,"What to expect from OnePlus’ flip foldable phone



OnePlus is reportedly planning to launch its first-ever clamshell foldable phone soon. Rumours claim that the upcoming smartphone is likely to be a rebranded version of the upcoming Oppo Find N5 Flip phone and may even be better at taking pictures than the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5.In a post on the Chinese social media platform Weibo, a tipster named Smart Pikachu claimed that OnePlus’s parent company Oppo may add a telephoto lens to its next flip phone.According to a report by TechRadar, OnePlus is also expected to add the same lens to its first-ever flip phone as the companies often share the same hardware.If the rumours are to be true, the telephoto lens in OnePlus’ first-ever flip foldable phone can offer the model a significant advantage over other foldable options . The telephoto lens will not only offer a longer zoom range but will also produce more improved portrait photos.It’s important to note that most clamshell-designed phones (except the Oppo Find N3 Flip) don’t pack a telephoto lens. The rumoured flip phone is also likely to benefit from the same Hasselblad colour tuning that is available in most of the recent Oppo and OnePlus flagship phones. This includes last year’s foldable models like the OnePlus Open and Oppo Find N3 Flip.Earlier, rumours claimed that the Oppo Find N5 Flip had been cancelled by the company. However, the tipster’s post claimed that Oppo has not given up on foldable products.The report also suggests that the company’s development is half a year behind its competitors. This may lead to the smartphone maker dropping the plan for both flip phones.Moreover, Oppo has denied these claims and said Flip phones are a popular form factor, the report added. This suggests that the company is unlikely to give up on the Find N Flip series. The report also claims that these phones may shift to a OnePlus-only edition in the coming days.","OnePlus is reportedly planning to launch its first-ever clamshell foldable phone soon.

Samsung phones may finally get this native Android feature,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/mobiles-tabs/samsung-phones-may-finally-get-this-native-android-feature/articleshow/109402415.cms,"Samsung is finally set to introduce a much-requested feature to its OneUI Android skin with the upcoming OneUI 7 update - a native vertical app drawer option. This functionality has long been demanded by Galaxy smartphone and tablet users but was previously only available through third-party launchers or Samsung's Good Lock app.According to the official overseeing Good Lock's development, the next major OneUI release will natively incorporate a vertical alignment mode for the app drawer.This revelation came as an explanation for why the vertical drawer option was recently removed from Good Lock's Home Up module .The stock OneUI launcher has lacked this vertical presentation mode, leading Samsung to offer it as an optional add-on through the Home Up utility. However, with OneUI 7.0 building in vertical app drawer support out of the box, the separate Good Lock implementation is now redundant.Now, the entire change appears to make sense as Android, by default comes with a vertical app drawer and Samsung not offering it even as an option was sort of unwelcomed by users who wanted a vertical app drawer.As of the moment, this is just a speculation based on the line of codes, however, Samsung will soon drop the OneUI 7.0 beta update considering Google is already offering users the optionto tryout the new Android 15 features and provide feedback.It is worth noting that, Samsung is yet to confirm the official One UI 7 beta details.",Samsung is set to introduce a much-requested feature to its OneUI Android skin with the upcoming OneUI 7 update.

Microsoft has finally resolved a major Windows 11 bug that prevented Windows 10 users from upgrading to the latest version of Windows. The issue surfaced due to an Intel driver conflict . The tech giant, as per Windows Latest report, has now lifted the upgrade block on affected PCs, allowing those users to make the jump to Windows 11.The issue, first flagged in November 2021, caused recurring Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) errors for Windows 10 PCs running Intel's 11th-generation Core processors with specific versions of the Intel SST driver (10.29.0.5152 or 10.30.0.5152).To prevent the problem, Microsoft enforced a compatibility block preventing those systems from upgrading to Windows 11After over a year, Microsoft has updated the bug's status to ""resolved"" on its health dashboard. The only fix was for users to manually update to the latest compatible Intel SST driver version from the manufacturer's website before attempting the Windows 11 upgrade – a cumbersome process for many.Now, Microsoft will offer the latest Intel driver through Windows Update, after which affected users should see the option to upgrade to Windows 11 within 48 hours.For those who don't receive the driver update automatically, Microsoft recommends contacting the device's manufacturer for the compatible version.The resolution comes as Microsoft continues to struggle to convince users to adopt Windows 11. As of March 2024, Windows 10 remains the dominant operating system with 69.2% market share according to StatCounter, while Windows 11 lags far behind at just 26.71% adoption despite an 8% year-over-year increase.While it is a good thing that Microsoft has finally fixed the long-known bug and allowed stuck Windows 10 users to upgrade to Windows 11. However, this does not change the system requirements for the Windows 11 operating system. This means nothing has changed for the unsupported Windows 10 devices.","Microsoft has finally resolved a major Windows 11 bug that prevented Windows 10 users from upgrading to the latest version of Windows.

The company plans to update its entire Mac lineup with the new M4 chips, with the first models expected to launch as early as the end of 2024.As reported by Gurman in his Power On newsletter, Apple has internally tested an M3 Ultra chip suitable for the Mac Studio and Mac Pro.However, he states that it is ""all but assured that at least some of Apple's high-end desktops"" will skip the M3 chip series and move directly to the M4 family.The M4 chip line will come in at least three main varieties: an entry-level version called Donan, more powerful models named Brava, and a top-end chip codenamed Hidra. According to people familiar with the matter, Apple aims to showcase the AI processing capabilities of these components and demonstrate how they will seamlessly integrate with the upcoming version of macOS, set to be announced at the company's annual developer conference in June.Gurman outlined the expected order of the M4 Mac releases:1. A low-end 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M4, coming around the end of 2024.2. A 24-inch iMac with the M4, also expected around the end of the year.3.

The company is experimenting with displaying promoted apps in the ""Recommended"" section, which echoes its previous attempts to integrate ads into its operating system .Currently limited to Windows Insiders in the Beta Channel within the United States , the ads should help users discover apps from the Microsoft Store , says Microsoft.By placing promoted apps alongside recently installed and frequently used programs, Microsoft hopes to increase exposure for its store offerings.While the promoted apps can be disabled through the Settings app, some users argue that this adds to the growing list of toggles and settings that need to be adjusted to achieve a clean, ad-free Windows 11 experience. The lack of a clear ""Promoted"" label next to the app name has also raised concerns about transparency, as users may not immediately realise that they are being presented with an advertisement rather than a personally relevant recommendation.Microsoft is seeking feedback on the changes, suggesting that the company may be open to modifying or removing the feature based on user response. The Windows Insider team has stated that the experiment will not apply to commercial devices managed by organisations, perhaps acknowledging the potential for disruption in professional settings.Critics of the move argue that Microsoft should focus on refining the Start menu's functionality and customization options rather than using it as a vehicle for advertising. Some have pointed out that the company already has ample opportunities to showcase its store offerings through the Microsoft Store app itself, as well as through other channels such as email newsletters and targeted online ads.Microsoft has a history of incorporating ads into its Windows operating system, with previous versions featuring promotional spots on the lock screen and Start menu. The company even briefly tested ads within the File Explorer of Windows 11 last year before turning off the experiment due to negative feedback from users.

The Computer Emergency Response Team ( CERT-in ) has issued a warning for users of various Microsoft products including Windows 10, Windows 11 and Microsoft Office . The cybersecurity watchdog has reported security bypass vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows products that could be exploited by the attacker to compromise the targeted system.The agency, which comes under the Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology, classified the vulnerability as ‘critical’ on the severity scale.“Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in Microsoft Windows which could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code, bypass security features, and compromise the targeted system,” Cert-In said.As per the agency, the vulnerabilities exist due to improper access restrictions within the proxy driver and insufficient implementation of the Mark of the Web (MoW) feature in Microsoft Windows.“The SmartScreen security feature protection mechanism bypasses the Mark of the Web (MotW) feature and allows malware to execute on a target system. The threat actors may exploit these vulnerabilities by sending specially crafted request,” it added.The products include -- Microsoft Windows, Microsoft Office, Developer Tools, Azure, Brower, System Center, Microsoft Dynamics, and Exchange Server.The agency advised users to apply appropriate security updates as mentioned in the company's update guide.Earlier this year, CERT-in issued a warning for users of Windows 10 and Windows 11 users, saying a vulnerability in Microsoft Windows Kernel that could be exploited by the attacker to gain elevated privileges on the targeted system.It classified the vulnerability – spotted in both 32-bit and x64-based systems – as ‘high’ on the severity scale.

The prompts, reading ""A new journey with Windows...,"" appeared after the recent Patch Tuesday updates, shown to users with PCs that are ineligible for the Windows 11 upgrade due to hardware requirements.The full-screen prompt thanks users for their loyalty to Windows 10 and warns them about the approaching end of life (EOL) date. It also encourages users to learn more about transitioning to a new Windows 11 PC. Notably, the prompt does not allow permanently dismissing the message.Users with Windows 10 PCs that do not meet the hardware requirements for Windows 11 have two options to remain secure beyond the EOL date: purchase a new PC with Windows 11 or pay Microsoft for extended security updates (ESU) on Windows 10. While pricing for ESU has not been revealed for individual users, business customers will have to pay $61 per device for the first year, with the cost doubling each subsequent year.Microsoft's decision to use full-screen prompts to encourage upgrades is not unprecedented. The company employed similar tactics during the transition from Windows 7 to Windows 10 nearly five years ago. While some users may find the prompts intrusive, Microsoft believes it is essential to inform users about the upcoming end-of-support date and the available options to maintain the security of their devices.The slower uptake of Windows 11 compared to its predecessor can be attributed to the more stringent hardware requirements, which include CPUs released from 2018 onward and devices that support TPM security chips integrated into the latest CPUs. As a result, many users decide to either upgrade their hardware or continue using Windows 10 with the understanding that they will need to pay for extended security updates after October 2025.Windows 10 is set to reach its end of support on October 14, 2025, after which users will no longer receive critical security and bug fix updates, leaving their PCs vulnerable to newly discovered security exploits.Microsoft has not clarified whether the full-screen prompts will appear more than once or if users should expect regular notifications over the next 18 months. The company has also not provided details on ESU pricing for consumers, although it has mentioned that schools will be offered significant discounts.","Microsoft has begun displaying full-screen prompts to Windows 10 users urging them to upgrade to Windows 11.

It's undeniable that women in video games were once overlooked or portrayed poorly, but fortunately, the landscape is changing. Developers and publishers now recognize that women play games, deserve well-written narratives, and games with female protagonists can be successful.Games with female protagonists are becoming more prevalent as developers shift away from traditional male characters.Indie games , in particular, excel at creating complex and flawed female characters. Explore this list of exceptional games featuring compelling female protagonists, sourced from The Gamer website.When considering standout roguelike games, titles like Hades, Dead Cells, and Slay the Spire often come to mind. However, Returnal by PlayStation and Housemarque stands out by offering excellent female representation with its protagonist, astronaut Selene Vassos (voiced by Jane Perry from Hitman). Selene navigates a planet trapped in a time loop, uncovering dual mysteries.Following a signal called 'The White Shadow' at the start of each loop, Selene encounters strange occurrences, including an unfamiliar house that appears amidst the alien landscape. Atropos, the planet, is teeming with hostile alien swarms and challenging bosses, creating a bullet-hell-like experience as Selene seeks answers.In prior Remedy games, the studio often featured tough male protagonists, but this changed with the 2019 release of Control. The game introduced Jesse Faden, a bold and courageous character who rises to become Director of the Federal Bureau of Control, wielding gravity-defying powers.Playing as Jesse, you'll have an exhilarating experience using her unique weapon and upgrades to battle the paranatural entities known as the Hiss, which have overrun the FBC. Jesse is also driven by the quest to uncover answers about her brother Dylan. The game stars Courtney Hope, who also portrayed Beth Wilder in Quantum Break, and shares connections with the Alan Wake universe.Amicia de Rune and Amanda Ripley both excel in keeping their composure in stealth horror gameplay, but Amicia faces daunting challenges like massive rat swarms and Inquisitor soldiers while protecting her brother Hugo throughout the game.Both ""A Plague Tale: Innocence"" and its sequel ""A Plague Tale: Requiem"" offer stunning and intense mediaeval adventures in a rat-infested world, showcasing exceptional graphics and set pieces for a Double-A title. The emotionally gripping story rivals games like ""The Last of Us,"" with performances by Amicia and Hugo that could earn Oscars.Although titled ""Alan Wake,"" Remedy's official sequel to the 2010 horror game shifts focus to Saga Anderson's pivotal role in aiding Alan's escape from the Dark Place. Saga serves as a central narrative figure alongside Alan and his wife Alice. As a playable FBI agent investigating Bright Falls and Alan's disappearance, Saga unravels mysteries while saving her daughter and reconstructing her own life.The gameplay alternates between Saga and Alan across separate ""Return"" and ""Initiation"" chapters, mirroring the manuscript structure. With twists and revelations tying together, Alan Wake 2's intense horror atmosphere, inspired by Silent Hill, challenges Saga beyond her agency expectations.Oxenfree may appear to be a charming game with puzzles, branching dialogue, and unique watercolour art, but it delves deeply into relatable life issues with its two female protagonists. The first game features teenager Alex, while the sequel, Lost Signals, introduces the older and more experienced Riley.This series excels in portraying well-written female characters.

However, in games like the Final Fantasy 13 trilogy and the Yuffie DLC for Final Fantasy 7 Remake, we see exceptions to this. Among these, Final Fantasy 6 stands out as one of the series' best entries, featuring not one, but two female leads.Terra's struggle with her lineage and past reveals her mental strength, while her physical prowess is evident from the start of the game. Similarly, Celes' resilience on the island with Cid demonstrates her mental toughness and ability to overcome depression, ultimately reuniting the party and leading to Kefka's defeat.Valve doesn't release new games frequently since the advent of Steam, but when they do, they are typically exceptional. The original Portal game was a brilliantly crafted physics-based adventure that captured gamers' imaginations, and its sequel surpassed expectations. Beyond the enjoyable gameplay and puzzles, the games excel in the captivating relationship between protagonist Chell and the psychotic AI system, GLaDOS.Despite being a silent protagonist, Chell is far from a shallow character. Enduring GLaDOS's insults and a seemingly hopeless situation, she persists in her testing, hoping to secure her freedom. This perseverance leads to a thrilling and fast-paced climax.Clementine doesn't take centre stage in the Telltale series until the second season, but she's often regarded as the highlight of the games.

As a British assassin in the Victorian era, Evie gained popularity quickly and remains one of the series' most beloved characters. Despite not having the entire game focused on her, Evie has many memorable moments and scenes in Syndicate that enhance the gameplay experience.Following the success of the Resident Evil 2 remake, a remake of Resident Evil 3 features Jill Valentine and Carlos Oliveira. Jill, a beloved character in the series, faces the intelligent bio weapon Nemesis after being attacked in her apartment. The game revolves around Jill's escape from Raccoon City while evading Nemesis's relentless pursuit. Some reviewers have likened Resident Evil 3's remake to Resident Evil 2's quality.Half-Life: Alyx is a VR instalment in the Half-Life series, focusing on Alyx Vance's quest to aid the resistance against the Combine.

The game features two protagonists, Leon S. Kennedy and the iconic Claire Redfield. Claire is celebrated as a beloved and formidable character in the Resident Evil series, and in this game, players assist her in escaping Raccoon City during a viral outbreak.Assassin's Creed Odyssey offers players the choice to play as Kassandra, a highly favoured protagonist in the series. Many players prefer Kassandra over Alexios due to her strong character design and voice acting. The game also introduces romance options and allows players to portray their character as a member of the LGBTQ+ community, adding to its inclusive features.In the sequel to The Last of Us, the focus shifts from Joel's journey to Ellie's struggle in a brutal world. Alongside Ellie, players also step into the shoes of the main antagonist, Abby.While some events and characters in the game were controversial, Abby's perspective offered a unique lens to the story, challenging players to reconsider their views on Joel and Ellie. This shift in perspective adds depth and complexity to the narrative, prompting a reevaluation of familiar characters and events.Tales of Berseria, the first game in the Tales series to feature a female protagonist, stands out as one of the best entries in years. The game follows Velvet Crowe, who witnesses her quiet village devastated by daemons due to an event known as Daemonblight.Velvet's transformation into a daemon-eating creature sets her apart as an unconventional female JRPG character. She embodies the role typically associated with male characters—a fierce, revenge-driven monster slayer.The original Tomb Raider games featured a tough female protagonist, but she was often depicted in skimpy attire and with exaggerated proportions. The modern Lara Croft is a more realistically portrayed and suitably dressed character. She transcends the archetype of a ""strong female protagonist"" to become a fully developed character with flaws, growth, and humanity. Despite some narrative dissonance where Lara exhibits emotional reactions to certain situations but then engages in intense combat shortly after, Lara's character development remains compelling and well-crafted.Celeste is a game that delves into themes of anxiety, personal growth, and existential challenges. It features outstanding platforming mechanics and a compelling female protagonist named Madeline (not Celeste, which is the mountain).

Additionally, her suit and ship designs remain iconic and timeless in gaming history.The Uncharted series follows Nathan Drake and his close bond with Victor Sullivan. Across the mainline games, Drake teams up with Sully to tackle numerous challenges.

Paired with Nadine, a South African mercenary leader, Chloe embarks on her own Uncharted adventure, showcasing witty banter and teamwork with two strong female leads, providing a refreshing experience.Bayonetta exudes toughness and confidence, unafraid to confront any challenge, even defying deities. She faces danger head-on, turning combat into a thrilling and stylish spectacle. Bayonetta's posh English accent and librarian glasses add an intriguing contrast to her fierce actions. The game's focus on both style and substance creates a balanced and enjoyable action experience.Ellen Ripley is a beloved cinematic icon known for her bravery in sci-fi and horror films. In Alien: Isolation, you step into the shoes of Ripley's daughter, Amanda, facing peril on the Sevastopol space station. Amanda uses her intelligence to outsmart deadly pursuers, including the xenomorph, while crafting weapons and navigating her environment to survive. She embodies her mother's courage and resourcefulness.Child of Light features Aurora, a young girl navigating a fantasy world as she copes with grief and depression.
