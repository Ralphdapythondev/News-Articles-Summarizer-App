Edtech startup Unacademy lays off 250 employees in latest round of job cuts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/edtech-startup-unacademy-lays-off-250-employees-in-latest-round-of-job-cuts/articleshow/111446332.cms,"What the company said

Edtech startup , Unacademy is facing fresh turbulence, with reports indicating the company has laid off 250 employees across various departments. This comes just weeks after the departure of its co-founder and CTO, Hemesh Singh.As reported by The Economic Times, the fresh round of layoffs has impacted around 150 employees from the sales function who were unable to meet targets.The remaining 100 belonged to various other departments within the company. While Unacademy has confirmed the restructuring exercise, they haven't disclosed the exact number of employees affected.“As part of our ongoing efforts to streamline operations and enhance business efficiency, we have recently undergone a restructuring exercise. This was necessary keeping in mind the company’s goals and vision for the year, as we focus all our efforts on sustainable growth and profitability. Consequently, some roles have been impacted,” the company said in a statement.This is the third round of layoffs conducted at Unacademy. Previously, the company let go of roughly 12% of its workforce (around 380 employees) in March 2023, and in April 2022, it downsized by approximately 1,000 employees including both contract and full-time staff.These layoffs mark the continuation of a trend plaguing the Indian edtech industry. In 2022, several major players, including Byju's and Vedantu, witnessed significant workforce reductions as the post-pandemic boom in online learning subsided. Unacademy itself had conducted layoffs earlier in 2023, and its medical entrance exam preparation platform PrepLadder also underwent a round of job cuts in May 2024.","Unacademy has laid off 250 employees across various departments.

Why Netflix increases plan prices

Netflix , in January, announced its plans to retire its cheapest ad-free plans in countries where it's available. A new report has said that the company has started the process to phase out its “Basic” plan, notifying users about the date on which their current subscription is expiring.According to a report by The Verge, several existing subscribers in Canada and the UK have received notifications urging them to choose a new plan by July 13.Reddit users shared screenshots of the notification, confirming the change.“Your last day to watch Netflix is July 13. Choose a new plan to keep watching,” the notification reads.“Your Basic plan has been discontinued, but you can easily switch to a new one. Plans start at just $5.99 with upgraded features,” it adds, and Netflix provides a button to allow users to “Choose a New Plan.”Previously, Netflix had stopped offering the Basic plan to new subscribers in the US, Canada, and UK in 2023. However, existing users continued to have access.Now, with the phase-out, subscribers will be able to choose from these three options:Ad-supported tier: $6.99/month with commercialsStandard ad-free tier: $15.49/month (previously standard price)Premium ad-free tier: $22.99/month with 4K streamingRecently, Netflix co-CEO Greg Peters explained that price increases for ad-free plans allow the streaming giant to invest in developing a wider variety of features and content, ultimately offering consumers more choice and value.“[T]hey want a higher diversity of shows, they want more quality shows, so that's our job. If we do that well, we'll go back and occasionally ask members to pay a little bit more to keep that flywheel running,” Peters said.It is to be noted that Netflix plan prices will remain unchanged in India, however, the company expanded password sharing curbs in the country in 2023. In India, Netflix subscription prices range from Rs 149 to Rs 649 per month.","Netflix has started the process to phase out its ""Basic"" plan.

Spotify is testing this new feature that it may be 'unsure' of what it will do,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/spotify-plans-to-go-beyond-music-tests-this-feature-that-may-interrupt-your-playlist/articleshow/111437600.cms,"What the company has to say about the test



How emergency alerts will work in Spotify



How this feature will help Spotify compete with Google and Meta



Spotify is venturing beyond music with a new test feature: emergency alerts . The popular music streaming platform is well known for its library of audio content. This pilot program, currently running only in Sweden , explores the possibility of governments and disaster relief authorities using the app to broadcast important public announcements .According to a report by TechCrunch, the code discovered within the Spotify app suggests that the system will be able to deliver updates on critical situations such as “accidents, serious events or disruptions of important services.”Spotify has also confirmed the test's existence, however, the company hasn't disclosed its motivations for offering this service.Currently, there's no legal requirement for them to do so in Sweden, but the company emphasises that it's simply exploring the app's potential for emergency alerts.In a statement shared with TechCrunch, the company mentioned that the feature was only being tested in Sweden.“At Spotify, we routinely conduct a number of tests in an effort to improve our user experience. Some of those tests end up paving the way for our broader user experience while most serve only as an important learning,” a Spotify spokesperson said.This feature was discovered by Chris Messina , a tech expert specialising in uncovering hidden functionalities. Messina speculates that emergency alerts could incentivise users to enable app notifications, a function commonly disabled for non-essential apps like those in entertainment or social media. This will allow Spotify to grab user attention more effectively and promote new features.The code discovered within Spotify's app offers further clues and includes phrases like -- ""Emergency alerts in Sweden,"" ""Receive public emergency alerts,"" and references to the Swedish public alert system (""Important public announcement, IPA"") -- all pointing towards this functionality. The code also includes a prompt to ""Visit the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency site for more information.""Beyond immediate notifications, integrating emergency alerts could imporve Spotify's status from an entertainment app to a more essential tool.This move may position the music streaming platform as a competitor to Meta 's ""Safety Check"" feature, a popular tool for disaster updates on social media.Similarly, Google utilises its apps' to warn users of dangers like earthquakes through Android alerts.In the US, legislators have even explored mandating emergency alert support on streaming services alongside traditional broadcasters.","Spotify is testing an emergency alert feature in its app. The pilot program is currently running only in Sweden.

Google now requires advertisers to disclose election ads that are ‘digitally altered’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-now-requires-advertisers-to-disclose-election-ads-that-are-digitally-altered/articleshow/111437234.cms,"What ads are exempted from this new policy

Deepfakes ahead of Lok Sabha elections in India

Google has announced an update to its advertising policy that will now require advertisers to disclose election ads that use digitally altered content to portray real or realistic-looking people or events. This policy applies to image, video and audio content.Under the updated political content policy disclosure requirements, advertisers must select a checkbox labelled “altered or synthetic content” when setting up their campaigns.This move is part of their ongoing effort to combat election misinformation .“We believe that users should have information to make informed decisions when viewing election ads that contain synthetic content that has been digitally altered or generated. Accordingly, verified election advertisers in regions where verification is required must prominently disclose when their ads contain synthetic content that inauthentically depicts real or realistic-looking people or events,” Google said.As per the company, this disclosure must be clear and placed in a location where it is likely to be noticed by users.According to the company, the ads that contain synthetic content altered or generated in such a way that it does not have any significant impact on the claims made in the ad are exempt from these disclosure requirements.“This includes editing techniques such as image resizing, cropping, colour or brightening corrections, defect correction (for example, “red eye” removal), or background edits that do not create realistic depictions of actual events,” Google said.Earlier this year, fake videos depicting Bollywood actors purportedly criticising the ruling party went viral online. Separately, ChatGPT-maker OpenAI announced in May that the company stopped five covert influence operations attempting to use their AI models for “deceptive activity” online, aiming to manipulate public opinion or influence political outcomes.Last year, Facebook-parent company Meta implemented a similar policy requiring advertisers to disclose the use of AI or other digital tools to alter or create political, social or election-related content on Facebook and Instagram.","Google has announced an update to its advertising policy that will now require advertisers to disclose election ads that use digitally altered content.

Apple MacBook Pro models with M4 chipsets: What to expect



Apple is expected to launch new MacBook Pro and MacBook Air models in the coming months. According to a report by Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, the rumoured MacBook Pro and MacBook Air machines are likely to come powered by three variants of Apple’s M4 chipsets -- the base M4, M4 Pro and M4 Max chipsets. The report also notes that the upgraded MacBooks may retain their predecessor's designs and may even offer new features through an AI subscription service which is expected to boost sales.Rumours suggest that Apple will soon release 14-inch and 16-inch models of MacBook Pros with M4 chips by the end of this year or early next year. Moreover, MacBook Air sizes are also in line for an early 2025 refresh.Currently, the only Apple devices with the M4 chip are the newest iPad Pro models . The most affordable option is the 11-inch iPad Pro with 256GB of storage which was launched at Rs 99,900.Gurman claims that both the MacBook Pro and MacBook Air won't see any design changes despite getting upgraded to the M4 chipsets. This comes after the 2021 redesign of the MacBook Pro with the M1 chip.He also suggested that a more significant visual overhaul might be coming in 2026, potentially coinciding with the adoption of OLED displays similar to the latest iPad Pro models.Similarly, the MacBook Air is also expected to wait until 2027 for a design refresh, five years after it departs from the wedge shape.Gurman acknowledges that a chip upgrade alone might not be enough to entice existing MacBook users to upgrade.To address this, Apple is reportedly considering a monthly subscription service that builds upon the free Apple Intelligence launching this fall.Additionally, Gurman claims Apple might integrate and potentially take a commission on third-party AI services like ChatGPT, mirroring their App Store model.",Apple is expected to launch new MacBook Pro and MacBook Air models in the coming months.

However, the bank will continue to send email alerts for all transactions with no absolutely change.In a mail as well as SMS alert sent to its customers, HDFC Bank said: “Starting from 25th June, 2024: Email Alerts: Continue to receive email alerts for all UPI transactions.SMS Notifications: Now only for transactions above Rs 100 (money sent/paid) and Rs 500 (money received).”This change aligns with banking norms, which require text messages for transactions over Rs 5,000. Despite this, many banks send alerts for lower-value debits as well. HDFC Bank stated that feedback indicated alerts for low-value transactions were deemed 'not useful,' as there is often duplication of notifications from UPI payment apps.Bankers noted that bulk text messages cost between Rs 0.01-0.03 each. With UPI transactions averaging around 40 crores per day, banks collectively spend several crores daily on text message alerts.Banks are also promoting the use of UPI Lite for transactions up to Rs 500. UPI Lite allows a small amount of money to be set aside by the app, facilitating quick payments without the need for second-factor authentication.By reducing the frequency of low-value transaction alerts, HDFC Bank and others aim to streamline notifications for customers while also cutting costs.

Apple iPhone 16 series rumours

Apple iPhone 16 series is expected to launch in September and in the run up to the debut, the rumour mill is already churning out scores of leaks. According to another such leak, iPhone 16 Pro Max is expected to get a boost in battery life .Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has said that the Cupertino-based giant is increasing the energy density of the battery cells of iPhone 16 Pro Max, which will result in longer battery life.“My latest supply chain survey indicates the energy density (Wh/kg) of the battery cells of iPhone 16 Pro Max will increase, which has the benefit of longer battery life with the same battery size or lower battery size with the same battery life,” he said in a post.However, with increase in energy density of the battery cells, there will be an increase in temperature when running. To tackle this, Apple will use the stainless steel battery case .“Increasing the energy density of the battery cells will increase the battery temperature when running. To avoid overheating the battery, Apple uses the stainless steel battery case for the first time as a thermal solution ,” Kuo said.While stainless steel may not be as effective as aluminium in dissipating heat, “it is more robust and less susceptible to corrosion, so in addition to dissipating heat, the stainless steel battery case provides better protection for the battery and the iPhone system.”Kuo noted that the use of a stainless steel battery case will reduce the difficulty of removing the battery, hence, helping Apple to “comply with the European Union’s requirements for mobile phone batteries’ replaceability in the future.”“If the mass production of this new battery design (upgraded energy density of battery cells & adoption of the stainless steel battery case) goes well and the feedback is favourable, this new battery design will be adopted in all 2H25 new iPhone models,” Kuo noted.The iPhone 16 series is rumoured to replace physical buttons with touch-sensitive buttons that simulate a press with haptic feedback. The camera layout might shift to a vertical design, unlike the current diagonal setup. The customisable Action button, currently on Pro models, might be available on all iPhone 16 models.Under the hood, the standard iPhone 16 and Plus models might use the A18 chip , while Pro models could get the A18 Pro chip. Meanwhile, the display size for iPhone 16 and Plus (6.1-inch and 6.7-inch) might remain the same, but the refresh rate could improve.","iPhone 16 Pro Max is expected to get a boost in battery life.
