Microsoft signs biggest clean energy deal signed ever by a company: All details,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-signs-biggest-clean-energy-deal-signed-ever-by-a-company-all-details/articleshow/109762573.cms,"What makes the deal huge

Microsoft Corp and Brookfield Asset Management 's renewable energy arm has signed a record-breaking clean energy agreement, according to a statement released Wednesday. The partnership comes as Microsoft ramps up its investment in artificial intelligence, Bloomberg reported.Tech companies are increasingly seeking clean energy solutions to meet their own sustainability goals while grappling with rising overall energy demands.This deal will see Brookfield Renewable Partners supply over 10.5 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity in the US and Europe beginning in 2026. That's roughly equivalent to the output of 10 nuclear power plants and reflects the skyrocketing demand for data center and AI-related electricity, Bloomberg noted.""This is undeniably the largest single corporate clean-power purchase agreement ever announced,"" said Bloomberg analyst Kyle Harrison. ""This solidifies Microsoft's position as the second-largest corporate buyer of clean energy"" via power purchase agreements, following Amazon , Bloomberg added.Estimating the cost of such a massive renewable energy project (10.5 gigawatts) is challenging due to variations in development costs based on location and energy type. However, BloombergNEF suggests that if the entire project were comprised of US solar farms, the construction cost would exceed $11.5 billion. Building the same capacity with wind power in the US would push the cost closer to $17 billion.Microsoft's heavy investment in AI development and the data centers required to support it stems from their belief in AI as a key tool to attract customers for their cloud computing services.Running AI tools requires immense resources, and many companies lack the data center capacity to handle large-scale AI operations in-house. This is why they are increasingly turning to big tech companies like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon for cloud-based AI solutions.Just last week, Microsoft reported a 17% jump in third-quarter revenue, reaching $61.9 billion, driven by a surge in demand for its cloud and AI offerings from corporations. Similarly, Amazon's cloud unit experienced its strongest sales growth in a year on Tuesday.Microsoft and Brookfield said the agreement dwarfs any previous corporate clean energy purchase deal by nearly eight times its size. The deal also has the potential to expand and include new renewable energy capacity in Asia and Latin America, the companies added.The focus will be on wind and solar power, but the accord also paves the way for ""new or impactful carbon free energy generation technologies,"" according to the companies.",Microsoft and Brookfield Asset Management have signed a record-breaking clean energy agreement.

Employees fired by Google over Israel protests go to National Labor Relations Board. Read full copy of complaint filed against the company,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/employees-fired-by-google-over-israel-protests-go-to-national-labor-relations-board-read-full-copy-of-complaint-filed-against-the-company/articleshow/109761924.cms,"What the complaint against Google claims

What Google said on terminating 50 employees

What happens to complaint against Google

Last month, Google fired some 50 employees for protests related to its contract with the Israel government. These employees have filed a complaint with the US labour regulators in an attempt to get their jobs back. Claiming their termination to be illegal, Google employees filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). The complaint claims that Google unlawfully terminated them and that these firings violated their rights under US labour law to advocate for workplace issues.The workers, reported to be around 50, were sacked following protests against Project Nimbus , a $1.2 billion deal between Google and Amazon to provide cloud services to the Israeli government.Google previously stated that they fired 28 employees who disrupted work during protests, and later confirmed the termination of 20 more involved in similar actions. The company maintains this behaviour was ""unacceptable"" and threatened other employees' safety.An attorney for the fired workers said in the complaint that Google's actions were ""in response to their protected concerted activity, namely, participation (or perceived participation) in a peaceful, non-disruptive protest that was directly and explicitly connected to their terms and conditions of work.""Google initially put nine employees on administrative leave for occupying its offices in New York City and Sunnyvale in protest. The company then fired 28 employees in connection with these protests.In an internal memo to staff a day later, Chris Rackow, Google’s head of global security, said the company would take further action if needed. “The overwhelming majority of our employees do the right thing,” Rackow’s statement read. “If you’re one of the few who are tempted to think we’re going to overlook conduct that violates our policies, think again. The company takes this extremely seriously, and we will continue to apply our longstanding policies to take action against disruptive behaviour — up to and including termination.” Less than a week later, Google fired more than 20 other employees.The NLRB will review the complaint. If deemed valid, they will attempt to mediate. If unsuccessful, the case could go before an administrative judge or a board appointed by the president. The fired workers are seeking reinstatement, back pay, and a guarantee from Google to respect their right to organise.","Google fired some 50 employees for protests related to its contract with the Israel government.

"How this 'very, very worried' email from Microsoft VP led to OpenAI investment",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-this-very-very-worried-email-from-microsoft-vp-led-to-openai-investment/articleshow/109760905.cms,"The 'very, very worried' email from Microsoft’s VP

Microsoft has made a significant investment in OpenAI , a startup specialising in artificial intelligence (AI). This investment has proven to be a turning point for OpenAI, providing them with the resources to develop next-generation AI technology . In turn, Microsoft has gained access to this technology for its products and services, strengthening its position in the rapidly growing field of AI.According to a report, this investment stemmed from Microsoft’s concerns over Google ’s lead in developing AI technology.Bloomberg said that according to an internal email released Tuesday (April 30) as part of the Justice Department’s antitrust case against the search giant, the Satya Nadella-led company invested heavily and partnered with OpenAI after it sensed falling badly behind Google in the AI race.The report says that Microsoft chief technology officer Kevin Scott was “very, very worried” when he looked at the AI model-training capability gap between Google-parent Alphabet efforts and Microsoft’s.He then wrote an email to CEO Satya Nadella and co-founder Bill Gates, after which the top executives privately acknowledged they lacked the infrastructure and development speed to catch up to the likes of the competition.“We are multiple years behind the competition in terms of machine learning scale,” Scott, who also serves as executive vice president of artificial intelligence at Microsoft, said in the email. Nadella forwarded it to Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood, saying it explains “why I want us to do this.”Nadella answered questions about the email when he testified at the trial last year, saying that the “investment [in OpenAI] was not made with the narrow focus on just search.”Scott reportedly observed that Google’s search product had improved on competitive metrics because of its advancements in AI.Meanwhile, the US Justice Department argued that AI innovations may have been released years ago if Google hadn’t monopolised the search market.","Microsoft has made a significant investment in OpenAI, a startup specialising in artificial intelligence (AI) This investment has proven to be a turning point for Open AI, providing them with the resources to develop next-generation AI technology.

Hustle until your haters ask if you're hiring.

Confidence is not 'they will like me.' Confidence is 'I'll be fine if they don't.'

I am strong, I am beautiful, I am enough.

She remembered who she was and the game changed.

Confidence is silent. Insecurities are loud.

Elegance is when the inside is as beautiful as the outside.

I am mine before I am anyone else's.

Doubt kills more dreams than failure ever will.

Confidence comes from within.

She believed she could, so she did. And she'll do it again.

You're never fully dressed without a smile.

The only limit is the one you set yourself.

Confidence is not being perfect; it's about being real.

Chin up, princess. Or the crown slips.

You are enough just as you are.

Don't let anyone ever dull your sparkle.

Life isn't perfect, but your outfit can be.

Beauty begins the moment you decide to be yourself.

Confidence is not 'they will like me.' Confidence is 'I'll be fine if they don't.'

You are allowed to be both a masterpiece and a work in progress.

Confidence is the sexiest thing a woman can wear.

A captivating romance can uplift anyone's spirits, and anime has a unique ability to vividly portray these narratives. Over the years, Japanese animation has delivered numerous romantic tales, ranging from light-hearted comedies to deeply emotional dramas.For romance enthusiasts, going through so many anime options can be overwhelming. However, there are several exceptional romance anime series that truly shine above the rest.Here is a curated list of top romance anime series , compiled by Game Rant, along with their respective rankings.Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie stirred mixed reactions upon its debut in Spring 2022, often compared to ""My Dress-Up Darling"" but standing out as a unique slice-of-life anime centred around a charming couple, Shikimori and Yuu Izumi.One distinctive aspect of the series is its portrayal of the main couple already in a relationship, a rarity in anime. While the episodes focus on everyday moments, they paint a wholesome picture of young love with two endearing characters navigating the nuances of romance.Describing Bakemonogatari as a straightforward romance might be a stretch, but this instalment of Monogatari indeed focuses on and highlights the relationship between Koyomi Araragi and Hitagi Senjougahara. Their initial interactions are unconventional, involving a stapler to the face, but Araragi's determination to assist Senjougahara with her curse ultimately brings them closer.Despite the surreal and eccentric nature of Monogatari, the romance between Araragi and Senjougahara is remarkably grounded and healthy. While the series introduces other potential romantic interests, their relationship remains steadfast and central to the narrative.""Sing 'Yesterday' for Me"" presents romance in a refreshingly realistic manner compared to many other anime. The series takes a classic love triangle and steers it in an unexpected direction by the end, resulting in a highly satisfying conclusion that portrays how failed romances can evolve into strong friendships.Directed by Yoshiyuki Fujiwara, known for his work on popular anime like ""Attack on Titan"" and ""Sword Art Online,"" the shift to a show with such a different tone demonstrates his versatility and mastery in storytelling across diverse genres.""My Happy Marriage"" emerged as one of the standout romance anime of Summer 2023, adapted from Akumi Agitogi's novel series. Set in an alternate Meiji Restoration era with supernatural elements, the story follows Miyo, who endures mistreatment from her stepfamily despite her privileged background. Her family arranges her marriage to a notorious military figure known for rejecting wives quickly, with rejection spelling disaster for Miyo. However, Kiyoka surprises everyone by taking an interest in Miyo and becoming incensed by her family's cruelty.The anime delves into the lasting impact of Miyo's abuse, highlighting her struggle to regain self-worth, even with Kiyoka's support. Kiyoka himself is a complex character with hidden motives behind his initial attraction to Miyo, although his feelings for her are genuine.While the romance between Miyo and Kiyoka is heartwarming, ""My Happy Marriage"" falls short in other areas. The supernatural elements can seem disjointed, and the villains are one-dimensional despite being detestable.Based on Fumita Yanagida's popular and finished manga, ""Tomo-chan Is a Girl!"" stood out as one of Winter 2023's most amusing romantic comedies. Tomo and Jun share a close friendship, but Jun sees Tomo strictly as a friend, unaware of her romantic feelings.While romance is central to its characters, ""Tomo-chan Is a Girl!"" leans heavily into comedy. Tomo and Jun's dynamic is charming, and they're supported by entertaining characters like Misuzu and Carol. Despite its comedic tone, the chemistry between Tomo and Jun develops convincingly over the season. Unlike some romance anime, Tomo-chan excels in portraying why its leads are compatible without difficulty.Teen romance anime often dominate the genre, but there are exceptions worth noting. ""Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku"" is primarily a workplace comedy that revolves around two couples: the newly formed pair of Hirotaka Nifuji and Narumi Momose, and the more established couple, Tarou Kabakura and Hanako Koyanagi. The focus remains on Hirotaka and Narumi, with the series emphasising humour over romance, but Tarou and Hanako's relationship is depicted realistically.Despite being childhood friends, Narumi struggles to see Hirotaka as a potential romantic interest, a dynamic that persists throughout the series. The anime's brevity limits the depth of these relationships, but ""Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku"" provides an entertaining journey within its runtime.""Romantic Killer"" cleverly parodies romance and harem anime while paying homage to their core strengths. Anzu, a girl with no interest in boys, is suddenly thrust into a reverse harem scenario by a magical being, disrupting her life of gaming and chocolate consumption. Unamused by her newfound romantic entanglements with unfamiliar guys, Anzu navigates this unconventional situation with scepticism.Primarily a comedy, ""Romantic Killer"" aims to elicit laughter from its audience, often succeeding with its humour rooted in its origins as a shonen manga, characterised by exaggerated facial expressions.Though not always aiming for emotional depth, the anime treats its characters and their relationships seriously. Anzu shines as a compelling lead, and the male characters introduced as potential partners are well-developed. ""Romantic Killer"" offers a delightful blend of humour and romance for those seeking an entertaining and unconventional love story.""The Angel Next Door Spoils Me Rotten"" captivates viewers from the start for several reasons. Firstly, Project No.9's animation is impressive, featuring clean and detailed character designs. Secondly, and most importantly, the main characters exhibit instant chemistry, evident when Amane offers his umbrella to a soaked Mahiru, sparking a connection.Throughout the series, despite the frequent presence of both leads on screen, ""The Angel Next Door Spoils Me Rotten"" effectively delves into their individual personalities while also developing their friendship.Rumiko Takahashi is celebrated as a legendary mangaka, known for classics like Inuyasha, Ranma 1/2, and Urusei Yatsura. While most of her renowned works fall within the shonen genre, Takahashi has also ventured into seinen storytelling. Maison Ikkoku stands out as one of her most mature works, emphasising romance as its primary theme.Unlike Takahashi's prominent shonen series that explore various genres such as comedy and action alongside romance, Maison Ikkoku focuses squarely on romantic elements, enriched with drama, character development, and humour.The central relationship features Kyouko and Yuusaku, both drawn to each other but hindered by their circumstances. Kyouko, grieving the recent loss of her husband, is hesitant to move forward. Meanwhile, Yuusaku, deeply in love with Kyouko, doubts his worthiness as a student. The anime chronicles their journeys of growth, healing, and mutual misunderstanding, complemented by well-developed secondary characters.Insomniacs After School emerged as the standout romance of Spring 2023, adapted from Makoto Ojiro's esteemed seinen manga. The story revolves around two students plagued by insomnia, a burden they carried alone until they met at their school's observatory. Isaki and Ganta form an immediate bond, which deepens as they work together to revive the Astronomy Club, driven by their shared need to preserve their newfound sanctuary.The anime boasts impeccable pacing, skillfully depicting the protagonists' isolation due to insomnia and the subtle solace they find in each other. While romance is a central theme, the series prioritises developing Ganta and Isaki's friendship before advancing their relationship, emphasising the depth of their connection beyond shared circumstances.Kokoro Connect injects a supernatural twist into a classic love triangle scenario. The story centers around Taichi, Iori, Yui, Yoshifumi, and Himeko, students of the Student Cultural Research Club, whose lives take a turn when they receive supernatural abilities from a mysterious being named Heartseed.As they grapple with these newfound powers, the group experiences sensory phenomena that challenge their relationships and reveal hidden aspects of their personalities. The anime is rich in character development, providing an engaging and thought-provoking experience.Maid Sama! carries many tropes that might derail other romance anime: an overly perfect male lead, a strong female protagonist reduced to a damsel, and an unnecessary love triangle. Despite these shortcomings, Maid Sama! shines through its strong personality.The heart of Maid Sama! lies in the relationship between Takumi Usui, a charming heartthrob, and Misaki Ayuzawa, a strict student council president with a busy schedule balancing school, home, and work. When Takumi discovers Misaki's secret job at a maid cafe, it opens a new perspective on the usually composed president.In ""Rascal Does Not Dream Of Bunny Girl Senpai,"" romance plays a subtle yet compelling role that defines the series. The story centers on Sakuta Azusagawa, a high school student drawn to girls suffering from Adolescence Syndrome, a condition linked to their insecurities.While the anime unfolds through different arcs focusing on various girls, the standout is the initial saga featuring Mai Sakurajima, an actress who forms a close bond with Sakuta. Their dynamic crackles with romantic tension, warmth, and clever banter. Although not always in the foreground, their relationship develops steadily across subsequent arcs, leading to a satisfying sequel in the form of a feature film.Wakana Gojou and Marin Kitagawa inhabit completely contrasting worlds. Gojou, isolated and reserved, keeps himself apart from others due to his passion for hina dolls, fearing ridicule. In contrast, Kitagawa is popular, outgoing, and self-assured.Despite their differences, Kitagawa becomes intrigued by cosplay and sees Gojou as the ideal person to create outfits for her. ""My Dress-Up Darling"" is a charming, humorous, and beautifully animated romance anime that excels in executing classic genre tropes with finesse.""Toradora!"" is a beloved slice-of-life romantic comedy that offers a wonderful entry point into the genre. The story revolves around Ryuji Yusaku and Taiga Aisaka, two students who have crushes on each other's best friends.Both Ryuji and Taiga are viewed as outcasts—Ryuji due to his intimidating appearance and Taiga because of her fiery temper. They team up to assist each other in their romantic pursuits. The series delves into their evolving dynamic and the humorous mishaps that ensue as they navigate their intertwined love lives.""The Pet Girl of Sakurasou"" depicts the journey of an eccentric group of characters as they navigate growth and self-discovery. Sorata Kanda is forced to move into the unconventional Sakura House after being kicked out of his school's main dorms.In Sakura House, Sorata encounters talented yet troubled students. When a peculiar young artist joins the dorm, Sorata takes on the responsibility of helping her adjust to her new life. The series delves into the interactions among the dorm mates, their personal aspirations, and the interconnected nature of their relationships.""Ouran High School Host Club"" is a delightful reverse harem anime filled with lighthearted and meaningful moments. Haruhi Fujioka accidentally breaks an antique vase belonging to her school's Host Club and must repay her debt by disguising herself as a boy and working as a host.The series excels in developing Haruhi's character along with her fellow hosts, providing insight into their motivations and personalities. It's a must-watch for shojo fans, featuring a memorable cast of characters that carries the show through its run.Kyoto Animation has produced many beloved anime, and ""Love, Chunibyo & Other Delusions!"" is among them. The series centers around a phenomenon known as Chunibyo, where adolescents have grandiose and unrealistic delusions.Yuta Togashi, who has outgrown his delusional phase, aims for a normal high school life. However, things take a turn when his classmate, Rikka Takanashi, reminds him of his past and tries to pull him back into the world of Chunibyo with her own delusions. The series delves into their relationship as Yuta unravels the triggers behind Rikka's delusions.The trope of opposites attracting may be overused, but when done well, it can lead to a captivating romantic comedy. ""Kimi ni Todoke"" explores the endearing friendship between the shy Sawako Kuronuma and the popular Shouta Kazehaya. Sawako, often mistaken for Sadako from ""The Ring,"" is isolated at school due to her appearance, making it challenging for her to break out of her shell. Fortunately, Kazehaya is just the right person to help her.""Kimi ni Todoke"" is a delightful and heartwarming anime with well-developed characters who evolve as the story unfolds. While it adheres to typical romance anime pacing, the journey remains engaging and enjoyable.Unlike most romance stories that focus on the process of falling in love, ""Tonikawa: Over The Moon For You"" follows a married couple who have already reached that point. As a result, the anime adopts a slice-of-life approach, showcasing Nasa and Tsukasa's daily life and antics rather than a typical romantic journey. ""Tonikawa"" doesn't rely on dramatic highs but instead offers a pleasant and light-hearted experience.While this anime may not appeal to everyone, it serves as a refreshing departure from more melodramatic romance shows. Despite their tendency to blush at the slightest physical contact, Nasa and Tsukasa are refreshingly direct in expressing their feelings, making them both witty and likeable characters.This romantic anime shines because of its main character, Takeo Gouda. His towering, imposing presence contrasts beautifully with his heartfelt affection for the delicate Rinko, which is truly heartwarming. Takeo's efforts to play matchmaker for Rinko with his best friend, despite his own feelings, demonstrate his genuine kindness.Viewers will undoubtedly root for Takeo and Rinko's endearing relationship. ""My Love Story!!"" delivers the goods without delay, as the main characters are dating for most of the episodes, bypassing the typical slow build-up to a confession.""A Sign of Affection"" is a heartwarming romantic comedy centred on college-age love and the challenges of communication. While not the sole focus of the story, Yuki and Itsuomi stand out as the main couple, instantly captivating viewers. Yuki, who is hearing-impaired, communicates using sign language, text, and by reading lips, while Itsuomi is a world traveller passionate about learning languages. Their connection begins on a train and grows stronger with each subsequent encounter.The anime beautifully captures the intense emotions of falling in love, highlighted by a poignant moment in the opening episode. With an older cast, ""A Sign of Affection"" takes on a more mature tone compared to typical romance anime. Throughout the season, Yuki and Itsuomi become increasingly comfortable around each other, resulting in consistently endearing interactions.This romantic anime is ideal for LGBTQ+ viewers seeking representation on screen, but its well-crafted storytelling makes it enjoyable for all audiences. The heartwarming romance blossoms between Mafuyu and Ritsuka as Mafuyu learns to play guitar and sing in Ritsuka's band.Watching Mafuyu's growing confidence alongside the romantic tension creates a compelling series that's hard to resist. The accompanying movie is also outstanding and a must-watch continuation of the series.Nana is one of the most renowned and beloved shoujo anime of all time, a must-watch for fans of romance and beyond. The series follows two women named Nana, seemingly different but navigating curiously similar life situations that lead to separate outcomes.Without giving away how their stories intertwine, Nana's 47 episodes delve into the protagonists' perspectives on love through various relationships. Grounded in reality, the anime explores complex characters who, despite occasional extremes, face accountability for their actions.Your Lie in April, one of the most famous romance anime, revolves around two music prodigies: Kousei Arima and Kaori Miyazono. Kousei, grappling with depression after his mother's death, loses his passion for the piano and withdraws from the performance arts. One day, he hears Kaori playing her violin with such freedom that it reignites his love for music and sparks his admiration for her.The anime delves into themes of grief, life, love, and music. Kousei's journey toward self-healing is profound, marked by heartbreak, but also punctuated by moments of beauty, tenderness, and joy.In this anime, Miyuki and Kaguya engage in a battle of wits to avoid confessing their love first, using their intellect and skills to outmaneuver each other. Both are determined not to be seen as the one who gives in.Their antics running the student council at an elite school with their friends are uproariously funny yet also contain heartwarming moments that will make viewers cheer. Season 3 of Kaguya-sama: Love is War, which aired in Spring 2022, leaned heavily into comedy but also devoted more time to developing Miyuki and Kaguya's relationship and touching on other romances.If the anime follows the manga, the next season of Love is War promises to be predominantly romantic. If successful, this upcoming release could elevate Kaguya-sama to the pinnacle of romance anime.This anime consists of two parts: Clannad and After Story. The latter surpasses the former by a wide margin, but watching Clannad is essential to fully appreciate the impact of After Story. While it features a diverse cast of supporting characters, the heart of the show revolves around Tomoya Okazaki and Nagisa Furukawa, delivering a profound narrative.Unlike typical romance series, Clannad After Story unfolds beyond high school, depicting the growth of Tomoya and Nagisa as individuals and as a couple. The anime tackles real-life challenges without glossing over them, offering a genuine exploration of common struggles.The Dangers in My Heart is truly brilliant. At first glance, it may seem like another typical shounen romance where a popular girl falls for an ordinary loner guy. These stories often offer little beyond wish fulfilment, and The Dangers in My Heart initially appears to fit that mould. Yet, the anime stands out.Ichikawa is an average guy with few friends who daydreams about unusual things. While the anime doesn't delve deeply into these thoughts, it doesn't ignore them either, leaving Ichikawa with a poor first impression. On the other hand, Anna is a cheerful but shy girl who loves food and works as a model. After a chance encounter at the school library, the two start spending time together, developing a friendship that hints at something deeper. Anna encourages Ichikawa to break out of his shell, leading to significant changes in him over the course of two seasons.Although slow-paced initially, The Dangers in My Heart evolves into something special by the end of season 1, maintaining its momentum in the subsequent cour and establishing itself as one of the best romance anime of all time. Anna and Ichikawa are both exceptional characters, but Anna's depth is what elevates the show. She's not just an idealised plot device; she's a fully realised character with insecurities, quirks, and vulnerabilities. Her interest in Ichikawa feels genuine, and vice versa. This is a rare quality in romance anime.Fruits Basket is the definitive romance anime, masterfully blending drama and comedy. Tooru Honda, a lovable protagonist, faces life's challenges until she moves in with the Souma family. The Soumas, particularly Yuki, are school idols hiding a shocking secret that alters perceptions.Love triangles often lack depth, favouring one partner over the other. Fruits Basket defies this norm with its compelling love triangle, where each character is fully developed. Across three seasons, Fruits Basket takes viewers on an unforgettable journey.Also read | 15 best anime series of all time; here's the list","Japanese animation has delivered numerous romantic tales, ranging from light- hearted comedies to deeply emotional dramas.

The application, posing as a gaming platform, purportedly enticed users with the prospect of significant investment gains. The ED claims that the app abruptly halted its operations, leaving users unable to withdraw their funds.The Enforcement Directorate started its investigation in 2022 following the discovery of evidence indicating that some of the acquired funds were invested in digital assets.Approximately 2,500 bank accounts associated with the operation were identified, and searches led to the seizure of around Rs 19 crore.Claims suggest that the E-Nugget app, disguised as a gaming platform, assured users of significant returns on their investments. The Enforcement Directorate (ED) launched its investigation following a police report filed by the Kolkata police concerning suspected illegal activities involving Aamir Khan and his associates. They stand accused of deceiving users of the E-Nuggets app with enticing returns before abruptly terminating the scheme. In the course of the operation, the ED seized ₹2.43 crore from 66 bank accounts under the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).Aamir Khan, identified as a central figure in the alleged scam, has been arrested and is currently in custody.

"This techie is the world’s richest prisoner, with a net worth of $43 billion",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/this-techie-is-the-worlds-richest-prisoner-with-a-net-worth-of-43-billion/articleshow/109753350.cms,"How Zhao’s sentence is different from Sam Bankman-Fried

The founder and former CEO of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange , Binance , Changpeng Zhao has been sentenced to four months in prison. According to a report by Bloomberg, he has been sentenced for failing to prevent cybercriminals and terrorist groups from trading freely on Binance. Last year, Zhao even pleaded guilty to violations of US anti-money laundering and sanctions laws.With this sentence, Zhao becomes the richest person to be imprisoned (in the US and perhaps even the world), and the second major crypto boss to be sentenced to prison after FTX ’s Sam Bankman-Fried .The report suggests that, unlike Bankman-Fried, Zhao’s assets worth $43 billion will remain untouched even with the sentence. Moreover, the ongoing crypto bull run is expected to increase his net worth even more while he is jailed.In 2023, Zhao stepped down as the CEO of Binance but still retains an estimated 90% stake in the world’s largest crypto exchange. Considering that the board of directors mostly comprises his close friends, Zhao’s influence on the company is still intact, the report noted.The sentence imposed by US District Judge Richard Jones in Seattle is relatively shorter than the three years requested by the prosecutors. His sentence was also much below the maximum 1-1/2 years recommended under federal guidelines.To compare, Zhao’s sentence was also much lighter than the 25 years of captivity that was imposed on Sam Bankman-Fried in March. Bankman-Fried was accused of stealing $8 billion from customers of the FTX crypto exchange which is now bankrupt. However, Bankman-Fried has appealed his conviction and sentence.Moreover, prosecutors also seemed happy with the sentence which was the outcome of a long investigation spanning years into Binance and Zhao. The billionaire also lived in the United Arab Emirates which is beyond US reach.In a statement shared with news agency Reuters, US Attorney Tessa Gorman said: “This was an epic day. Incarceration was critical in this case and we’re pleased with the result.”","Changpeng Zhao has been sentenced to four months in prison for failing to prevent cybercriminals and terrorist groups from trading freely on Binance.

"Uber to stop operations in Pakistan, here’s the big reason",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/uber-to-stop-operations-in-pakistan-heres-the-big-reason/articleshow/109753265.cms,"What it means for Uber users, drivers in Pakistan

Uber has said that it has shut down operations in Pakistan. US-based Uber entered Pakistan in March 2016. The decision comes as the ride-hailing app is reportedly facing strong competition from local Pakistani cab apps .According to news agency ANI, Uber said that the decision to shut operations in Pakistan is in line with Uber's global growth strategy and focuses on markets where we have opportunities for sustainable growth.“We've made the decision to cease operating the Uber app in Pakistan. Our subsidiary brand Careem will continue to operate, with the Careem app offering ride-hailing services across Pakistan,” the spokesperson was quoted as saying.Uber ceased operations in Karachi, Multan, Faisalabad, Peshawar and Islamabad in 2022. It had been operating in these five cities through Careem and the Uber app in Lahore.Uber acquired Careem’s Pakistan operations for $3.1 billion in 2019. Under the deal, Careem became a wholly owned subsidiary of Uber but continues to operate independently with its branding, services and separate app.According to an Uber Pakistan spokesperson, users on Uber will have to switch to Careem. Users who had balance in their accounts would be able to reclaim their amounts in due course and be offered free rides on Careem.Meanwhile, drivers associated with Uber have the option to sign up for Careem Rides.“We work closely with Careem Rides teams to minimise the impact on drivers that use the Uber app,” Uber spokesperson said.The report claims that this development has eroded the dominant position previously held by Careem and Uber in Pakistan. Currently, the most popular service appears to be In-Ride, which allows users to negotiate fares directly with the driver.As of now, Careem operates in 10 cities across Pakistan: Karachi, Islamabad, Lahore, Peshawar, Multan, Faisalabad, Abbottabad, Gujranwala, Sialkot and Quetta.","US-based Uber entered Pakistan in March 2016.

BJP takes poll campaign to foreign shores,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/lok-sabha-elections/lok-sabha-election-news/bjp-takes-poll-campaign-to-foreign-shores/articleshow/109768055.cms,"LUCKNOW: BJP ’s campaign for the Lok Sabha elections is not just confined to India, it’s touching the foreign shores too.Party’s international wing — Overseas Friends of BJP — is spearheading the campaign among the NRIs and Indian diaspora in several countries by organising marches and car/bike rallies to create a momentum in favour of the party.The UP chapter of Overseas Friends of BJP organised a 4-km march in London where participants held the party flags and placards and raised the slogan of “Abki baar 400 paar”.Despite rains, the march was a success and was taken out from Westminster to Tower Bridge (London bridge), said Dhirendra Nim, an office-bearer of the wing’s UK unit and added that the idea was to show support for the Modi-led BJP.On April 28, a “Run for Modi” along with a flash mob event was organised in London, he said. Similar campaigns have been organised by the group in Africa, Dubai and the US.The purpose of such campaigns is to encourage Indians living abroad to persuade their relatives in India to wholeheartedly vote for the BJP so that Narendra Modi returns for the third term, said Nim.“We have been sharing our opinions with our relatives in India and telling them how proud we are of the Modi govt which has greatly enhanced the image of India on the global platform in the last 10 years,” Nim told TOI.“Most of us settled abroad keep visiting India and have seen the country’s major transformation with our eyes,” said Nim, a businessman, who hails from UP’s Saharanpur district and has been based in England since 2006.“It takes me just 3 hours to travel from Delhi to Saharanpur compared to 6 hours travel time earlier. This has become possible due to the quality road network laid in UP and across the country. Such developments took place in the last decade and cannot be ignored,” he added.We would consider our efforts successful if we are able to convince even a small section of Indians to re-elect the Modi govt, he said.",Party’s international wing is spearheading the campaign among the NRIs and Indian diaspora in several countries.

LUCKNOW: Living on the fringes, facing discrimination and exclusion in a variety of ways, persons with disabilities (PwDs) are now making their voice felt, and rightly too. From guaranteed income, increased job opportunities to improved accessibility to buildings and transportation, PwDs have put forward their demands from political parties in the ongoing Lok Sabha elections to improve their quality of life.They said they are pleased that three major political parties have promised to look into their issues, but they want more parties to focus on their demands and take tangible action beyond mere words.Furthermore, they emphasize the importance of enforcing existing laws like the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act (RPwD) 2016.Speaking to TOI, Arman Ali, executive director of the National Centre for Promotion of Employment for Disabled People (NCPEDP), stressed the importance of taking action to address the needs of people with disabilities.He highlighted the necessity for health insurance coverage aligned with Ayushman Bharat and increased representation in Parliament and governance.“Although some of these demands were included in the manifestos of major parties in the 2019 LS polls, they were not fulfilled,” he said.Ali emphasised the growing political awareness and participation among disabled individuals.Amit Rawat, a visually impaired PhD student from Lucknow University, pointed out that while one major party's manifesto included promises related to housing and transportation improvements, other parties focused on care centres, increased pensions, and Braille inclusion.“There is need for tangible action beyond words. Parties must prioritise employment for disabled individuals and address implementation issues such as train seat reservations etc,” he said.Another disabled student, Ram Vijay from Shakuntala Mishra Deemed University, expressed disappointment with the parties in failure to fulfill the previous promises.He cited the example of an app called Suramya Bharat, intended to assist disabled individuals in suggesting improvements to public spaces, which has not been effectively implemented.“We face challenges when we visit govt offices, access roads and even schools, colleges. There is a need for concerted efforts from all political parties to address these issues,” he said.Shiv Prasad, an activist from Maharajganj, highlighted disparities in pension amounts across states and stressed the need for uniformity and increased support.He also pointed out the lack of clarity in provisions of the RPwD Act, emphasizing the need for representation of disabled people in politics and policymaking.Krishna Kumar, an MEd student from Shakuntala University, stressed the importance of increasing reservation for disabled individuals in education and employment.He explained that the types of disabilities covered under the act have increased significantly, necessitating a proportional increase in reservation quotas to ensure inclusivity.*Committed to continuing the provision of affordable housing prioritising persons with disabilities under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana*Accessible solutions tailored to the needs of disabled individuals*Raise pensions for disabilities under the National Social Assistance Programme from Rs 200-500 per month to Rs 1,000 pm.Expand constitutional provisions of Article 15 and 16 to prohibit discrimination based on disability and impairment, or sexual orientation.*Care centres and inclusion of Braille.*Recognise Braille script as sign language and enforce the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016.*Proposed measures such as disability budgeting, earmarking 5% allocations across ministries for the disabled, and removal of GST on aids and appliances."," persons with disabilities (PwDs) are now making their voice felt, and rightly too.
