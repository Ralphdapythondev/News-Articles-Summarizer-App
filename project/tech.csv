EU accuses Meta of violating Digital Market Act with Facebook and Instagram 'pay or consent' ad model,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/eu-accuses-meta-of-violating-digital-market-act-with-facebook-and-instagram-pay-or-consent-ad-model/articleshow/111413188.cms,"The European Commission has formally accused Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, of breaching the EU 's Digital Markets Act ( DMA ) with its "" pay or consent "" advertising model . The preliminary findings, announced on Monday, allege that Meta 's approach forces users to either pay for ad-free services or consent to extensive data collection for personalised advertising.""Our preliminary view is that Meta's advertising model fails to comply with the Digital Markets Act,"" said Margrethe Vestager, Executive Vice-President in charge of competition policy. ""And we want to empower citizens to be able to take control over their own data and choose a less personalised ads experience.""The Commission argues that Meta's model violates Article 5(2) of the DMA, which requires ""gatekeepers"" to offer users a less personalised but equivalent alternative if they refuse to consent to data combination across services. Regulators claim Meta's binary choice does not provide this option.""Meta's 'pay or consent' business model is in breach of the DMA,"" stated Thierry Breton, Commissioner for Internal Market. ""The DMA is there to give back to the users the power to decide how their data is used and ensure innovative companies can compete on equal footing with tech giants on data access.""The Commission's preliminary findings state that Meta's model ""forces users to consent to the combination of their personal data and fails to provide them a less personalised but equivalent version of Meta's social networks."" They further clarify that ""users who do not consent should still get access to an equivalent service which uses less of their personal data, in this case for the personalisation of advertising.""Meta introduced the subscription model in November 2023, charging up to ‚Ç¨12.99 per month for ad-free access to Facebook and Instagram in the EU. The company maintains that its approach complies with regulations.""Subscription for no ads follows the direction of the highest court in Europe and complies with the DMA,"" a Meta spokesperson said. ""We look forward to further constructive dialogue with the European Commission to bring this investigation to a close.""The Commission has until March 2025 to conclude its investigation. If found in violation, Meta could face significant penalties. If found in violation, Meta could face fines of up to 10% of its global annual turnover, potentially reaching $13.5 billion based on 2023 figures. The fines can go up to 20% in case of repeated infringement.The case against Meta, following closely on the heels of charges against Apple, underscores the EU's determination to enforce its new digital regulations. Margrethe Vestager commented on the tech giants' responses to the new regulations, saying, ""We are dealing with the biggest and most valuable companies on the planet. The DMA is not an excessive ask. [It] is plain vanilla to ask for a fair, open and contestable marketplace.""","The European Commission has formally accused Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, of breaching the EU's Digital Markets Act.

The National Human Rights Commission ( NHRC ) has issued notices to the central government and Tamil Nadu state authorities following reports of discriminatory hiring practices at Foxconn 's biggest iPhone manufacturing plant in the country near Chennai. The commission's action comes in response to a Reuters investigation that uncovered systematic exclusion of married women from assembly line jobs at the facility ""NHRC observes that the matter, if true, raises a serious issue of discrimination against married women causing the violation of the right to equality and equal opportunity,"" the commission stated as quoted by PTI.The NHRC has requested a detailed report within a week from both the labour ministry secretary and the Tamil Nadu chief secretary.The Reuters conducted an investigation at Tamil Nadu‚Äôs Sriperumbudur between January 2023 and May 2024, which revealed that Foxconn, a major supplier for Apple , had been rejecting married women applicants for iPhone assembly jobs. Dozens of job seekers, advertisements, and WhatsApp discussions, showed that Foxconn's third-party recruiters explicitly stated that only unmarried women were eligible for assembly jobs.Hiring agents and HR sources cited family responsibilities, pregnancy risks, and higher absenteeism as reasons for not hiring married women. S. Paul, a former human resources executive at Foxconn India, told Reuters: ""Risk factors increase when you hire married women."" He explained that the company's view was that there were ""many issues post-marriage,"" including that women ""have babies after marriage.""In response to the allegations, Apple acknowledged lapses in hiring practices in 2022 and claimed to have worked with Foxconn to address the issues. Meanwhile, Foxconn has ""vigorously refuted"" the allegations ofemployment discrimination based on marital status or gender.While Indian law doesn't specifically bar companies from discriminating in hiring based on marital status in the private sector, legal experts suggest such practices could be challenged. Several women's groups have called for investigations into the matter.The human rights commission emphasised that gender equality is not only required by the Indian constitution but also by international treaties and covenants.

Starting June 25, HDFC Bank will stop sending text alerts for low-value UPI transactions. This means that HDFC Bank customers will receive SMS alerts for UPI transactions exceeding Rs 100 when sending money and similar notification for when received is above Rs 500. However, the bank will continue to send email alerts for all transactions with no absolutely change.In a mail as well as SMS alert sent to its customers, HDFC Bank said: ‚ÄúStarting from 25th June, 2024: Email Alerts: Continue to receive email alerts for all UPI transactions.SMS Notifications: Now only for transactions above Rs 100 (money sent/paid) and Rs 500 (money received).‚ÄùThis change aligns with banking norms, which require text messages for transactions over Rs 5,000. Despite this, many banks send alerts for lower-value debits as well. HDFC Bank stated that feedback indicated alerts for low-value transactions were deemed 'not useful,' as there is often duplication of notifications from UPI payment apps.Bankers noted that bulk text messages cost between Rs 0.01-0.03 each. With UPI transactions averaging around 40 crores per day, banks collectively spend several crores daily on text message alerts.Banks are also promoting the use of UPI Lite for transactions up to Rs 500. UPI Lite allows a small amount of money to be set aside by the app, facilitating quick payments without the need for second-factor authentication.By reducing the frequency of low-value transaction alerts, HDFC Bank and others aim to streamline notifications for customers while also cutting costs.

Apple is expected to launch its next-gen iPhone 16 series models in September. However, rumours and speculations related to the upcoming iPhones are already making the rounds on the internet. Now, a new leak suggests that the iPhone 16 may get a major design overhaul.In a post shared on the social media platform X (earlier Twitter), a tipster named Ice Universe shared a video showing the alleged case of the upcoming iPhone 16.The leaked case reveals that the upcoming iPhone 16 may have a vertical rear camera setup, similar to the one that was last seen on iPhone 12.The new case design also reveals a new cutout at the right side of the phone which may house a dedicated camera shutter button for the iPhone 16 Pro models.The dedicated shutter button which is expected to come powered by the company‚Äôs haptic engine is rumoured to join the existing physical buttons. This button may use a soft tap for focus and a double tap/hard press for capture, offering an improved camera experience.This alignment will reportedly enable spatial video recording capabilities similar to iPhone 15 Pro which has two cameras stacked vertically while the third camera is arranged diagonally.However, the latest rumours contradict earlier reports that suggested that the iPhone 16 may arrive with a buttonless design.The leaked case also suggests that Apple may be adding more buttons alongside the volume and power controls. The customisable ""Action"" button, which was introduced in iPhone 15 Pro, may also make a return in iPhone 16. This button also has the potential to replace the mute switch and offer users programmable functionalities.
