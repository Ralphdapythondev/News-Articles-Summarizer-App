Telegram CEO Pavel Durov is said to have been arrested in France on Saturday, August 24, on charges related to criminal activity on the platform and a lack of cooperation with law enforcement. Durov, 39, was detained at Le Bourget Airport near Paris after arriving from Azerbaijan on a private plane. He was not immediately charged but remained in custody, which could be extended until Wednesday.The Paris prosecutor, Laure Beccuau, said in a statement that the arrest was part of an investigation opened on July 8 into a range of potential charges, including complicity in the distribution of child pornography , drug trafficking, money laundering, and refusal to cooperate with law enforcement.The investigation is being conducted by cybercrime and anti-fraud specialists. Beccuau said that Durov was questioned by investigators as part of this process.It is unclear whether any of the charges listed by Beccuau will ultimately be brought against Durov. In France, complex criminal cases are handled by special magistrates who have broad investigative powers and can place defendants under formal investigation. However, charges can be dropped if there is insufficient evidence to proceed to trial, and cases can be lengthy.Durov's arrest has sparked a debate about free speech on the internet. French President Emmanuel Macron dismissed accusations from Telegram supporters that the arrest was an example of government censorship. He stated that the arrest was a purely judicial matter and not a political decision.French President Emmanuel Macron, making the first official confirmation of Durov's arrest since he was detained at Le Bourget airport outside Paris on Saturday evening, said there was no political motive in the arrest, despite many false comments online. He added that France remains deeply committed to lawful free speech.""The arrest of the Telegram president on French territory took place as part of an ongoing judicial investigation,"" Macron wrote on X. ""This is in no way a political decision. It is up to the judges to decide.""Telegram, which has over 900 million users, has been criticized for its lax content moderation policies. While this has allowed people in authoritarian regimes to communicate freely, it has also made the app a haven for harmful content, including extremist groups and illegal activities.Law enforcement agencies worldwide have been increasing pressure on technology companies to address issues such as disinformation, online extremism, child safety, and the spread of illicit material. Durov's arrest could further strain relations between France and Russia, which are already tense due to French support for Ukraine in the war against Russia.Telegram has denied any wrongdoing and stated that Durov has nothing to hide. The company has also emphasized its commitment to user privacy and free speech."," Pavel Durov, 39, was detained at Le Bourget Airport near Paris after arriving from Azerbaijan on a private plane.

YouTube may soon allow users to share specific timestamps of videos on mobile: Here’s how it can help users,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/youtube-may-soon-allow-users-to-share-specific-timestamps-of-videos-on-mobile-heres-how-it-can-help-users/articleshow/112814889.cms,"How this feature will help YouTube users



&t=1m30s

YouTube is reportedly testing a simplified way to share specific timestamps or clips from a video. Currently, sharing a particular timestamp on YouTube's mobile app involves several steps. According to a report by 9to5Google, this new feature will enable users to share a specific timestamp or clip directly through the in-app share sheet . However, the report didn't specify when Google plans to roll out this feature to all users.At TOI-Gadgets Now, we checked for the feature on YouTube version 19.33.35 for Android but couldn’t find it, suggesting the company may be testing it with a limited group of users.YouTube allows users to share extra timecodes or timestamps on mobile through the “Clip” feature. Currently, to share specific timestamps of a video adding “&t=” and the associated time in “XmXXs” format. For example:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jfQHMjHaPIThis feature was also introduced for YouTube Shorts earlier this year, which allows content creators to add clips from official music videos to their Shorts.However, this method limits the exact length and is a bit tricky as users have to crop the timeline. This results in a 60-second looping YouTube Short of the chosen content.With this new feature, when users click the share button, they'll notice a toggle in the upper right corner of the share sheet. This toggle will allow users to share a specific part or moment of the video they're currently watching. The feature makes it easy to link directly to the exact timestamp they want to share with others.The report also shares screenshots to show how the new toggle on the in-app share sheet will look once it becomes available for all users.Meanwhile, on desktop, users can manually enter a timecode, but on YouTube mobile, the app doesn’t offer that option yet. Instead, users are allowed to adjust the time by scrubbing through the video timeline.Currently, this is the only way to change the timestamp in the share sheet. After users tap “Copy link,” it creates a text link that they can share in other apps. Since it’s a standard YouTube format, users can edit this text link if they want to choose a different time within the video.",YouTube is reportedly testing a simplified way to share specific timestamps or clips from a video.

Netherlands fines Uber $324 million for breaking this 2018 EU law,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/netherlands-fines-uber-324-million-for-breaking-this-2018-eu-law/articleshow/112813201.cms,"What Dutch official said against Uber



“In Europe, the GDPR protects the fundamental rights of people, by requiring businesses and governments to handle personal data with due care. But sadly, this is not self-evident outside Europe. Think of governments that can tap data on a large scale. That is why businesses are usually obliged to take additional measures if they store the personal data of Europeans outside the European Union. Uber did not meet the requirements of the GDPR to ensure the level of protection of the data with regard to transfers to the U.S. That is very serious.”

“Because Uber no longer used Standard Contractual Clauses from August 2021, the data of drivers from the EU were insufficiently protected,”

What Uber said about the fine



“This flawed decision and extraordinary fine are completely unjustified. Uber’s cross-border data transfer process was compliant with GDPR during a 3-year period of immense uncertainty between the EU and US We will appeal and remain confident that common sense will prevail.”

The Dutch Data Protection Authority (DPA) has imposed a 290 million euro ($324 million) fine on ride-hailing platform Uber for illegally transferring personal details of European drivers to the US. According to a report by the news agency AP, the decision alleges that Uber's data transfers violated the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) by failing to implement adequate safeguards. EU nations adopted the GDPR laws in 2018 which requires companies to take technical and organisational measures aimed at protecting user data. However, Uber has strongly contested the fine and even called it flawed as well as unjustified. The report also notes that the company has also announced plans to appeal the decision.The case originated from complaints by 170 French Uber drivers, but the fine was imposed by the Dutch authority since Uber’s European headquarters are located in the Netherlands.In a statement to AP, DPA chairman Aleid Wolfsen said:The decision follows a 2020 ruling by the EU's top court that invalidated the Privacy Shield agreement, which allowed companies to transfer data to the US.The Dutch data protection authority stated that while standard contractual clauses can be used for data transfers outside the EU, they must ensure an equivalent level of protection. Uber's data transfers were found to violate this requirement.the watchdog said.DPA also added that Uber has been using the successor to Privacy Shield since the end of last year, ending the alleged breach.In a statement to AP, Uber said:","The Dutch Data Protection Authority (DPA) has imposed a 290 million euro ($324 million) fine on ride-hailing platform Uber for illegally transferring personal details of European drivers to the US.

Why Mosquito species matter

Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has lately been sharing a lot of content on Malaria on his Instagram handle. In his most recent video, he is seen dropping a mosquito made of Lego from a tall building. Along with the mosquito, he also throws a ball and a worm.“If we eradicate malaria, polio, and guinea worm, I’d consider it a smashing success,” Bill Gates said.His video clip coincided with his blog post in which he talks about “The newest weapon against mosquitoes: computer vision.”Gates has said that the use of computer vision technology is crucial in the battle against malaria, a disease that kills over 600,000 people annually. He introduced VectorCam – an app developed by Dr. Soumya Acharya and his team at Johns Hopkins University, with support from the Gates Foundation and Uganda's malaria control program.“The app can distinguish among the different species that transmit malaria. It can also determine the sex of the mosquito and, if the insect is a female, whether it has recently fed on blood or developed eggs. And with further refinement, VectorCam could identify species that carry other diseases, like dengue and Zika,” he wrote.Understanding mosquito species is crucial for effective disease control. Different species carry different diseases, some none at all. For instance, malaria is transmitted solely by Anopheles mosquitoes.These insects also vary in their behaviour. Some bite indoors, others outdoors. Some are active at dusk, others during the day. And only females bite, needing blood to lay eggs.Computer vision is changing mosquito identification by quickly and accurately identifying species, helping scientists better target their vulnerabilities, and save more lives.Gates also talked about other “promising developments in mosquito surveillance.”“One has the clever name of HumBug—an app that identifies mosquito species by the sound of their wing beats, captured by the microphone in a smartphone. (It turns out that different species flap their wings at different speeds.)” he said.HumBug is still in the early stages.","Gates has said that the use of computer vision technology is crucial in the battle against malaria, a disease that kills over 600,000 people annually.

Why Durov left Russia in 2014

Telegram's 'controversial role' in the Ukraine war

Elon Musk comes in support of Pavel

Telegram chief executive Pavel Durov was arrested at a Paris airport for offences related to his popular messaging app. Durov was detained at Le Bourget airport in Paris after arriving on a private jet. Telegram is an encrypted messaging app, ranked as one of the major social media platforms after Facebook, YouTube, WhatsApp, Instagram , TikTok and WeChat.Durov is accused of failing to take action to curb the criminal use of his platform. He faces investigation for allegedly allowing a wide range of crimes due to a lack of moderators on Telegram and lack of cooperation with police. A cybersecurity gendarmerie unit and France 's national anti-fraud police unit are leading the investigation.Encrypted messaging app Telegram allows groups of up to 200,000 members, which has led to accusations that it makes it easier for false information to spread virally. There are also accusations that the app is used to disseminate neo-Nazi, paedophilic, conspiratorial and terrorist content. Telegram has committed to never disclosing information about its users.The 39-year-old technology billionaire Pavel Durov holds dual French and UAE citizenship and has been vocal about keeping Telegram a neutral platform. According to Russian and French media, Durov became a French citizen in 2021. Durov is estimated by Forbes to have a fortune of $15.5 billion. Telegram was created by Durov and his brother Nikolai, a programmer and mathematician. The app is said to have around 900 million active users. Durov has also accused the FBI of seeking a backdoor into Telegram.Durov reportedly left Russia in 2014 after refusing to comply with demands to shut down opposition communities on his VK social media platform. Durov, however, has not said whether he renounced his Russian citizenship.Telegram app is particularly influential in Russia, Ukraine and the republics of the former Soviet Union. Telegram has become a major source of unfiltered content from both sides of the Ukraine war. Ukrainian and Russian governments both use Telegram heavily. The platform has become what some analysts call 'a virtual battlefield' for the war, used heavily by Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and his officials, as well as the Russian government.Tesla CEO Elon Musk posted the hashtag #FreePavel on the X social media platform, formerly Twitter. He wrote in French, ""Liberte Liberte! Liberte?"" (Freedom Freedom! Freedom?).

Former Amazon VP: CEO of startup I worked with got me divorced,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/former-amazon-vp-ceo-of-startup-i-worked-with-got-me-divorced/articleshow/112792027.cms,"Read the complete post here

A CEO that I worked for seduced my wife in direct retaliation for my pushback on him at work. He won. I got divorced and left the company. When I say I truly understand how some executive teams can be political snake pits, I trust you will believe me. Learn from my pain - do the following:

1) When you have a good manager, lean in and take advantage of it.

2) Spot the snakes.

3) Do excellent work, even for nasty leaders.

4) Don’t confront the snakes directly

5) Don’t become a snake

1) When you have a good manager, lean in and take advantage of it.

While I “survived” bad bosses, most of my career progress came while working for good, honest, and helpful managers.

Hold on to these managers as much as you can. Help them grow and succeed so that you can stay together, and you can grow and succeed with them. See success as a partnership with the people you can trust.

Ultimately, the key to my career success was excelling when I had good managers and just surviving in the periods when I did not.

Also, notice I say take advantage of “it”, not “them”. Take advantage of and benefit from having a good manager.

Don’t become dishonest and take advantage of someone else for your benefit.

I recognized early on that my CEO in the divorce story was unethical and dishonest. My mistake was letting fear of a tough economy convince me to try to stay in the job and ""win"" by pushing back. It cost me far more than I ever thought it could.

Action: Do whatever you need to get to a good manager! Leave before the snake bites.

2) Spot the snakes.

Generally, it doesn’t take long to figure out who is a good person and who is only looking out for themselves.

There are so many ways to see through the dishonest people:

– See if their actions match their words

–Talk to others who have been there longer - they know!

– Investigate their pasts - talk to someone who used to work for them but is now safely away

A smooth talker may fool you in person, particularly if you give people the benefit of the doubt. Observing carefully and doing your research can help you not fall for the charm of someone you shouldn’t trust.

Being cautious is important, but there is a big difference between being watchful and skeptical and being cynical and untrusting. Extend some trust in case your leader is a good person, but do not make yourself fully vulnerable until you know.

With the CEO I talk about, I had ""spotted the snake"" - my mistake was staying too long and getting bitten.

3), 4), and 5)

I'm out of room here. To read about why you need to do excellent work for nasty execs, why you shouldn't confront them, and about not becoming a snake yourself, subscribe to our newsletter.

"Why TRAI's ‘September 1 deadline’ for Airtel, Reliance Jio and Vodafone-Idea is ‘bad news’ for your OTPs",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-trais-september-1-deadline-for-airtel-reliance-jio-and-vodafone-idea-is-bad-news-for-your-otps/articleshow/112787423.cms,"What is the big change

What is Whitelisting or URLs

Similar disruption in 2021

Starting September 1, consumers might experience disruptions in receiving service and transactional messages from banks, financial institutions, and e-commerce firms on their mobile phones. This follows a directive from the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) aimed at reducing spam, particularly phishing attempts.Trai has instructed telecom companies to stop transmitting messages containing URLs, OTT links, APKs (Android application packages), or call-back numbers that are not whitelisted—registered with telcos—by senders from September 1.This directive means that banks, financial institutions, and online platforms must register their message templates and content with operators by August 31. If they fail to do so, messages containing these elements will be blocked.Currently, entities register their headers and templates with telcos but not the content of messages. This means operators do not check the content of transmitted messages. However, starting next month, telcos must create a mechanism to read the content of commercial messages and block those that do not match their records, according to experts.In India, 1.5-1.7 billion commercial messages are sent daily, totaling about 55 billion every month, according to industry data.Airtel, Reliance Jio and Vodafone-Idea want extension in deadlineAccording to a report in Economic Times, industry executives say the telecom sector is seeking more time from Trai to implement the mandate as the blockchain-based distributed ledger technology (DLT) platform needs updating. However, the regulator believes it has given sufficient time to the telcos and is unwilling to extend the deadline, according to officials familiar with the matter.Bharti Airtel, Reliance Jio, and Vodafone Idea did not respond to ET’s queries.Whitelisting requires entities sending messages to provide all information related to URLs, call-back numbers, etc., to telcos, who will then feed the information into their DLT platform. If the information matches, the message is passed; otherwise, it is blocked.For example, most transactional messages from banks, such as funds debit or credit, contain a call-back number. Transmission of such messages will be stopped if a bank does not whitelist the number.“Only those entities, including banks, which whitelist their URLs or content of the messages with telcos, will pass through; the rest will be blocked,” said a telecom industry executive.Mobile consumers faced a similar outage in March 2021 when the DLT platform was implemented, and telcos started scrubbing messages. At that time, there was widespread disruption as telcos blocked all commercial messages that did not contain whitelisted headers and templates. Following the disruption, all entities have since registered their headers and templates with telcos.Experts say that in the current scenario, an increasing number of messages may shift to over-the-top (OTT) platforms like WhatsApp and Google’s rich communication services (RCS) messaging, as there is no such mandate from Trai to govern them. However, banking messages, where rules do not permit transmission over OTT, will be blocked if the entities have not been whitelisted, the experts added.","Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) has instructed telecom companies to stop transmitting messages containing URLs, OTT links, APKs, or call-back numbers that are not whitelisted by senders.

Google kills Fitbit smartwatches; says smartwatch portfolio now is ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-kills-fitbit-smartwatches-says-smartwatch-portfolio-now-is-/articleshow/112651343.cms,"Fitbit as a smartwatch brand is effectively over. No surprises, as many would say. The writing has been there on the wall for sometime now. Google acquired Fitbit in 2021, since then there were speculations about the future of the brand. While since 2021, Google launched three Pixel series smartwatches, including the Pixel Watch 3 at the recent 'Made for Google' event, there have been two Fitbit smartwatches -- Versa 4 and Sense 2.The Fitbit Versa 4 and Sense 2 were launched just months before Google’s first Pixel Watch.Google has now confirmed that Fitbit as a brand will no longer be making new smartwatches and that the Pixel Watch series will be taking over that form factor going forward. Speaking to Engadget, Google’s director of product management for Pixel wearables, Sandeep Waraich, said, “Pixel Watch is our smartwatch part of the portfolio”. Waraich said the same in response to a question about the future of the Fitbit-branded smartwatches, adding that Pixel Watch is “our next iteration of smartwatch for Fitbit.”But while you may not get Fitbit smartwatches, Fitbit brand per se is not being killed. Google will continue to make Fitbit fitness bands . Fitbit-branded products will focus on trackers that are “more minimalistic” with long battery life, said Waraich.As to what happens to Fitbit smartwatch customers . Google said, ""We are very committed to Fitbit, and even more importantly to the customers that use and depend on those products and technology. It's also worth noting that many of the health and fitness features we launched in Pixel Watch 3 were because of Fitbit's innovation and ground-breaking fitness advancements. In addition, we just launched Fitbit Ace LTE , and you’ll continue to see new products and innovation from Fitbit.""This means that Google will continue to provide software updates, and even new features to both devices.As for Pixel Watch fans, Google has launched Pixel Watch 3 in India, starting at RS 39,99. Pixel Watch 3 will go on sale in the country in September.","Google acquired Fitbit in 2021, since then there were speculations about the future of the brand.
