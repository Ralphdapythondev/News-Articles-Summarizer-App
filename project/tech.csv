"Comcast reports data breach affecting 230,000 customers in ransomware attack",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/comcast-reports-data-breach-affecting-230000-customers-in-ransomware-attack/articleshow/114030973.cms,"How the data breach happened

What is Comcast doing for impacted users

US telecom giant, Comcast has confirmed that a data breach involving some of its customers' information occurred in February 2024. The company revealed the incident following a recent court filing in Maine.According to the filing, the data breach originated from a ransomware attack targeting Financial Business and Consumer Solutions (FBCS), a debt collection agency previously used by Comcast.Hackers gained unauthorised access to FBCS 's computer network between February 14th and 26th, 2024. During this time, they reportedly downloaded sensitive data and encrypted some of the agency's systems.The compromised data reportedly includes personal information belonging to over 237,000 Comcast customers. This information potentially includes names, addresses, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, Comcast account numbers, and ID numbers used internally by FBCS.While Comcast claims they stopped using FBCS for debt collection in 2020, it appears the breach affects customers who were subscribers around 2021. Initial reports from FBCS allegedly indicated no customer data was compromised, leading to a delay in Comcast notifying affected individuals. It wasn't until July 2024 that the debt collection agency disclosed the data breach to Comcast.Comcast is currently notifying impacted customers and advising them to take steps to protect themselves from potential identity theft. To help mitigate the potential risks associated with the data breach, Comcast is providing affected customers with complimentary identity theft protection services for a period of at least 12 months. This includes membership in CyEx Identity Defense Complete, which offers comprehensive credit monitoring services. Along with this, the company has also asked the users to remain vigilant of frauds and check their account statements.","US telecom giant, Comcast has confirmed that a data breach involving some of its customers' information occurred in February 2024.

Terra Terwilliger , director of strategic initiatives at Google DeepMind, revealed that the company's Gemini AI model now handles 40% to 50% of information requests sent to its legal team.Speaking at Fortune's COO Summit in Middleburg, Va., Terwilliger highlighted the significant time savings achieved through this implementation.""It saves a remarkable amount of time,"" she noted, describing how AI is used for ""finding information that you know you have somewhere, but you can't put your hand on it right then.""This use of AI for information retrieval and basic tasks allows high-skilled employees to focus on more valuable work, Terwilliger explained. She emphasised the importance of training employees to use AI effectively, urging organisations to ""make sure we're valuing the time that people are putting in to learn how to use these systems and rewarding them for doing so.""Google DeepMind isn't alone in harnessing AI for routine tasks. At the same event, Sebastian Guth , chief operating officer of Bayer's global pharmaceuticals division, shared that his company uses AI to complete 70% to 80% of regulatory filings required for drug development.Both executives stressed that AI implementation is about improving organizational efficiency rather than replacing human workers. Guth cautioned against ""using technology for technology's sake,"" emphasizing that AI should be a means to an end, such as developing drugs faster.","Google DeepMind is using AI to streamline operations, particularly in its legal department.

A Global Trend with a Chinese Twist

The New York Times reports that Lin Yunyun, a 28-year-old seller on China's fast-growing e-commerce platform Pinduoduo, has experienced the relentless pressure to lower prices firsthand. Unlike what she expected, Pinduoduo constantly sends ""reminders"" whenever other sellers undercut her on diaper prices. Even after reducing her prices, the platform pushes for further cuts to maintain her product's visibility.Pinduoduo exemplifies China's current struggle with deflation.Consumers, rattled by a sluggish economy and a seemingly endless real estate crisis, are reportedly tightening their belts. This spending slowdown has triggered falling prices and shrinking profits, creating a vicious cycle. While the government scrambles for solutions, Pinduoduo thrives on this environment.Pinduoduo has become the go-to destination for value-conscious shoppers in China, embracing a trend called ""downgraded spending."" It's no surprise then, that with over 60% of Chinese consumers shopping online, Pinduoduo's aggressive pricing strategy, mirrored by competitors, has significantly contributed to the deflationary spiral.The NYT report captures the dilemma of Chinese journalist, Zhang Zhuo, who wrote in her reportedly censored WeChat post, ""The Better Pinduoduo Is, the Worse the Times Are."" She argued that Pinduoduo conditions consumers to prioritize the cheapest option over brand loyalty.""Merchants have two choices: lower prices or lose sales,"" Zhang wrote.While some shoppers, like office worker Gao Ning, appreciate the convenience and value Pinduoduo offers, it comes at a cost. The platform's relentless price wars may be a convenient way to buy groceries and household goods, but they also reflect a deeper economic anxiety in China.","Pinduoduo has become the go-to destination for value-conscious shoppers in China, embracing a trend called ""downgraded spending"" The platform's aggressive pricing strategy, mirrored by competitors, has significantly contributed to the deflationary spiral.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114022556,imgsize-111214,width-400,resizemode-4/114022556.jpg"

This shift in focus aims to address the company's struggle to move beyond the research and development phase and accelerate manufacturing processes.The CEO identified two main goals for 2024: increasing engine production and successfully launching the New Glenn rocket.

Cybercrime syndicates are often of Chinese origin

A new report by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime ( UNODC ) may increase problems for Telegram . The report claims that the encrypted messaging app has become a key tool for powerful criminal networks in Southeast Asia where large-scale illicit activities, including trade of stolen data, cybercrime tools for deepfakes and unlicensed cryptocurrency exchanges for money laundering are taking place.According to a report by news agency Reuters, hacked data including credit card details, passwords and browser history are openly traded on a vast scale on the app, the report said.“We move 3 million USDT stolen from overseas per day,” the report quoted one ad as saying in Chinese.As per the report, several cybercrime groups -- often of Chinese origin -- are operating from fortified compounds and exploiting trafficked workers. It says that these groups target victims worldwide with fraudulent schemes, generating an estimated annual revenue between $27.4 billion and $36.5 billion.""For consumers, this means their data is at a higher risk of being fed into scams or other criminal activity than ever before,"" warned Benedikt Hofmann, UNODC's deputy representative for Southeast Asia and the Pacific.The report also underscores how criminal groups are constantly adapting and integrating new technologies into their operations. UNODC identified over 10 deepfake software providers specifically catering to criminal groups involved in cyber-enabled fraud in Southeast Asia.This isn't the first time Telegram has faced scrutiny for its role in facilitating illegal activities.Recently, in India, a hacker is reported to have exploited Telegram chatbots to leak sensitive data from a major insurance company.A legal action against Telegram and its founder, Pavel Durov, was taken in France. He was charged with allowing criminal activity on the platform, including the spread of child sexual abuse material. Similarly, South Korean police are reportedly investigating the platform's potential involvement in online sex crimes.",A new report by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime ( UNODC ) may increase problems for Telegram.

Tensions are escalating in the U.K. as banks and payment companies grapple with social media firms over who should bear the cost of compensating victims of online fraud . Starting October 7, banks will be required to reimburse up to £85,000 to victims of authorized push payment (APP) fraud, a scam where criminals trick people into sending them money.This could prove costly for large financial institutions.While the mandatory reimbursement amount is lower than the initial proposal by the Payment Systems Regulator (PSR), questions remain about whether banks are shouldering an unfair burden.Revolut, a digital bank, has accused Facebook and Instagram parent Meta of failing to do enough to combat fraud and called for tech companies to contribute to compensation. This aligns with broader concerns that social media platforms are not taking sufficient measures to protect users from scams.The government is considering proposals to force tech firms to reimburse fraud victims. However, determining a regulatory framework for companies that don't play an active role in payment systems is complex.Banks and regulators have long urged social media companies to collaborate more closely to combat fraud. They seek more detailed intelligence on criminal activities and faster removal of fraudulent accounts.Social media firms argue that they are taking steps to address fraud, including through partnerships with banks and the use of advanced technology. They also emphasize the need for cross-industry collaboration.","Starting October 7, banks will be required to reimburse up to £85,000 to victims of authorized push payment (APP) fraud, a scam where criminals trick people into sending them money.

What China has to say on hacking charges

Chinese hackers have reportedly infiltrated the networks of major US broadband providers , gaining access to sensitive information, including data from systems used for court-authorised wiretapping.The hackers may have access to network infrastructure used to cooperate with lawful US requests for communications data for months, says the report from a Wall Street Journal, which cited sources familiar with the matter as saying.The attackers also had access to other tranches of more generic internet traffic, they said.Verizon Communications , AT&T and Lumen Technologies are among the telecom companies affected by this breach. The hackers, believed to be part of a Chinese intelligence-gathering operation dubbed “Salt Typhoon” by US investigators, may have accessed and intercepted communications data legally obtained by the US government through court orders.The report also said that the hackers appear to have collected vast internet traffic from internet service providers. Additionally, there are indications that the hacking campaign targeted a small number of service providers outside of the US, the people were quoted as saying.“It will take time to unravel how bad this is, but in the meantime it’s the most significant in a long string of wake-up calls that show how the PRC has stepped up their cyber game. If companies and governments weren’t taking this seriously before, they absolutely need to now,” said Brandon Wales, former executive director at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and now a vice president at SentinelOne, referring to the People’s Republic of China.China's foreign ministry responded to the allegations, denying knowledge of the specific attack but accusing the US of fabricating a narrative to blame China.“At a time when cybersecurity has become a common challenge for all countries around the world, this erroneous approach will only hinder the efforts of the international community to jointly address the challenge through dialogue and cooperation,” the ministry said in a statement to news agency Reuters.This incident follows recent US efforts to disrupt other Chinese hacking groups, including “Flax Typhoon” and “Volt Typhoon.”",Hackers may have accessed and intercepted communications data legally obtained by the US government through court orders.

The 'overspending on AI' debate

Why Shazeer left Google after 21 years

Back to Google -- Homecoming

The AI Talent War

What Shazeer's return to Google may signify

Noam Shazeer , a pioneer in the field of artificial intelligence, left Google in 2021 after clashing with management over the release of a powerful chatbot he co-developed. However, in a surprising turn of events, Google has brought him back with a massive deal. According to a report in WSJ, Google paid a staggering $2.7 billion to acquire Shazeer's company, Character.AI .While officially presented as a technology licensing deal, the true prize was Shazeer himself. Now a Google vice president, he will spearhead the development of the company's next-generation AI project, Gemini . This aggressive move raises questions about the escalating cost of acquiring top AI talent. While Shazeer is undoubtedly a brilliant mind, some experts wonder if the price tag reflects his true value.As the report said, ""The arrangement has thrust him into the middle of a debate in Silicon Valley about whether tech giants are overspending in the race to develop cutting-edge AI, which some believe will define the future of computing.""Shazeer joined Google in the year 2000 and was among the company's first few employees. He's credited with co-authoring a groundbreaking research paper that became a cornerstone for modern AI. He also championed the creation of Meena, a chatbot capable of engaging conversations, which Google ultimately shelved over safety concerns.In 2017, Shazeer teamed with a Google colleague, Daniel De Freitas, to build a chatbot originally named Meena that could banter confidently on a range of topics. In a widely circulated memo, “Meena Eats the World,” Shazeer predicted it could replace Google’s search engine and produce trillions of dollars in revenue, said people familiar with the document.Google reportedly did not release the chatbot to the public, citing concerns around safety and fairness. Shazeer and De Freitas quit in 2021 to launch Character. ""Feeling Google lacked the boldness he believed was necessary for AI advancement, Shazeer left to launch Character.AI. Their vision: a chatbot that could benefit those struggling with loneliness or depression. However, the company faced an uphill battle against established giants and the high costs associated with AI development,"" said the report.With Character struggling financially, Google pounced on the opportunity to reacquire Shazeer's expertise. While the deal enriched him with hundreds of millions of dollars, Google's primary goal was to secure his talent.This hefty price tag reflects the intense competition for top AI talent. Google isn't alone in using ""acqui-hire"" deals to secure talent from struggling startups rather than go through lengthy acquisition processes. This approach allows them to quickly onboard coveted researchers whose companies lack a strong revenue stream.Shazeer's return signifies a shift in Google's approach to AI. Co-founder Sergey Brin signaled a more aggressive strategy, emphasizing a willingness to rapidly deploy AI technology. Shazeer's expertise will be crucial in Google's quest to stay ahead in the race for AI dominance. At a recent conference, Brin said that Google was previously too timid in deploying AI applications. Now, he said, Google is developing and launching AI technology as fast as it can. “Noam, by the way, is back at Google, which is awesome,” he added.","Noam Shazeer, a pioneer in the field of artificial intelligence, left Google in 2021 after clashing with management over the release of a powerful chatbot he co-developed.
