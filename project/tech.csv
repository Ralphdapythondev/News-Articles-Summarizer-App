Google is taking steps to personalise the messaging experience with the rollout of a new ""Your profile"" feature in Google Messages . This update gives users more control over how they appear to their contacts, addressing privacy concerns and fostering a more connected communication experience.Previously, users had limited options for customising their profiles within Google Messages.Now, the ""Your profile"" feature offers a dedicated space to manage your profile picture and name displayed during conversations. When opening Google Messages, a prompt may appear inviting you to ""Customise how you are seen.""Tapping this prompt leads to the ""Your profile"" page, where users can edit their displayed name and choose a profile picture. The picture is pulled from your Google Account by default, but you can also choose a custom image.More importantly, the update introduces control over who gets to see your profile details.

"Intel does another U-turn, looking to sell a part of its chip subsidiary that it called ‘core part of its future’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/intel-does-another-u-turn-looking-to-sell-a-part-of-its-chip-subsidiary-that-it-called-core-part-of-its-future/articleshow/114359884.cms,"FILE PHOTO: FILE PHOTO: llustration taken January 8, 2024.

Intel is exploring stake sale in Altera, its programmable chip subsidiary . The chipmaker is aiming to sell a minority stake in Altera, sources familiar with the matter told CNBC. Quoting people with knowledge of the matter, the report said that Intel is seeking a deal that values Altera at around $17 billion.Intel has reportedly approached potential investors, including private equity firms, about acquiring a significant portion of the business, with the possibility of selling a majority stake.This move represents a dramatic shift for Intel, which acquired Altera for $16.7 billion in 2015. It comes as the company faces significant financial pressures , with its stock price down 50% this year amid fierce competition from rivals like Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices .The potential sale would mark a departure from Intel's previous stance on Altera. As recently as last month, CEO Pat Gelsinger had described the business as core to Intel's future. The company had earlier suggested it might monetize Altera through an IPO by 2026, but the current sale process indicates a more urgent need for capital.Intel's decision is part of a broader restructuring effort, which includes spinning off its foundry business as an independent subsidiary. The company reported a $1.6 billion loss in the first quarter of 2024 and announced 15,000 job cuts in August, underscoring its financial challenges.Despite these difficulties, Intel has secured a significant win for its newly independent foundry business, announcing a multibillion-dollar agreement withAmazon Web Services to produce an ""artificial intelligence fabric chip"" using its advanced 18A manufacturing process.The restructuring also involves pausing construction of new chip plants in Europe and reducing Intel's global real estate footprint. Bloomberg reports that CEO Gelsinger described these changes as ""the most significant transformation of Intel in over four decades.""Intel's strategic shifts have attracted attention from industry rivals. Arm reportedly approached Intel about acquiring its product division but was rebuffed, while Qualcomm has expressed interest in a potential takeover of Intel.","Intel is seeking a deal that values Altera at around $17 billion, CNBC reports.

Early Success

Pro Model Surge

Challenges Ahead

Long-Term Outlook

Apple's latest iPhone series, iPhone 16 , has good news for Apple in China . Bloomberg reports strong sales for Apple's newest iPhone in China, quoting research firm Counterpoint. Compared to the 2023 model, sales are up 20% in the first three weeks, according to Counterpoint Research data. This is a positive sign for Apple, after facing challenges in the crucial Chinese market last year.Though the smartphone market is stagnant, the iPhone remains Apple's most crucial product, generating roughly half of its sales.Strong iPhone sales in China are a positive indicator for Apple's overall performance.The iPhone 16's success can be attributed to several factors. A smooth production ramp-up, consistent pricing strategy, and existing user upgrades all contributed to ""substantial growth"" in China, said Counterpoint analyst Ivan Lam.Consumers are also gravitating towards pricier options, with sales of the top-tier Pro and Pro Max models jumping 44% compared to their predecessors.Despite the promising start, competition remains fierce. Local rivals like Vivo's X200 Pro, Huawei's upcoming Mate device, and updates from Xiaomi and Oppo threaten to steal market share. Additionally, the ongoing economic slowdown in China might lead some consumers to delay purchases until major shopping holidays like Singles' Day in November.While the iPhone 16 boasts AI features, the lack of a local partner for these features in China poses a potential hurdle. Analysts previously expressed concerns about this, as Beijing restricts foreign-developed AI models. Apple may need to collaborate with a Chinese company like Baidu to fully utilize these features in the region.While the initial response is positive, it remains to be seen how the iPhone 16 will fare throughout its lifespan. The success will depend on navigating intense competition and the ongoing economic climate in China.","Apple's latest iPhone series, iPhone 16, has good news for Apple in China.

Google Maps may move this weather feature on Android; here’s how it can change the map experience,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-maps-may-move-this-weather-feature-on-android-heres-how-it-can-change-the-map-experience/articleshow/114351227.cms,"Representative Image

How this move may alter the map viewing experience







Google Maps' India-centric features



Google Maps for Android is reportedly getting a more streamlined interface. The tech giant is testing a new design of its maps service by relocating the weather widget to the ""Latest in the area"" sheet that appears from the bottom of the screen. Previously displayed in the top-left corner, the weather information is now reportedly appearing in the top-right corner of this expandable sheet.According to a report by 9to5Google, this change aims to declutter the map view and provide Google Maps users with a cleaner and less obstructed experience.The report also includes screenshots to show when the ""Latest in the area"" sheet is minimised, the weather widget appears in the bottom-right corner, allowing users to quickly access information without hiding the map.The latest update follows another recent simplification effort by Google, where the app's bottom bar was reduced from five tabs to three.While this change aims to declutter the map view, it may make it slightly less convenient to quickly check the weather while exploring the map.Currently available in the beta version (11.151.x) of Google Maps, this update hides the weather information behind an extra tap. Users who prefer to see the temperature, conditions, and AQI at a glance may find this change less efficient.It remains to be seen whether this design will make its way to the stable release of Google Maps. Feedback from beta testers will likely play a role in Google's decision to roll out this change more broadly.In July, Google Maps added 6 new features which are designed specifically for Indian users . These features use AI and collaborations with local experts to address common challenges faced by commuters across the country.With these features, Indian users got access to AI-driven navigation that optimises routes, information on EV charging stations, and enhanced public transport options. Additionally, Google Maps also partnered with local guides to provide curated recommendations for places to visit and things to do.These updates reflect Google's commitment to tailoring its services to the specific needs of users in different regions. By incorporating AI and local expertise, Google Maps aims to provide a more seamless and informative navigation experience for commuters in India.","Google Maps for Android is reportedly getting a more streamlined interface.

Jio and Airtel wanted spectrum auction

Telecom Minister clarifies

Starlink CEO and X (previously Twitter) owner Elon Musk posted that Starlink ‘will do our best to serve the people of India’. Musk was responding to the announcement made by union telecom minister Jyotiradtiya Scindia that satcomm spectrum will be allocated administratively and not auctioned. “BREAKING: India’s government said it will allot spectrum for satellite broadband administratively and not via auction, hours after Elon Musk criticized the auction route being sought by billionaire Mukesh Ambani Good News for Starlink,” X user DogeDesinger wrote in a post.Replying to the post, Musk wrote “Much appreciated! We will do our best to serve the people of India with Starlink.”Earlier this week, both Jio and Airtel called for a revised approach to spectrum allocation for satellite communication companies in India. In a letter to the telecom minister, Jio emphasised that satellite companies should acquire spectrum through a transparent auction process, similar to traditional telecom players. Speaking at IMC 2024, Bharti Airtel Chairman Sunil Mittal favoured bidding for such allocation.Musk then termed their demand as ‘unprecedented’.Telecom Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia said on Tuesday that such airwaves will be given out through administrative allocation and not auctioned. ""Satellite spectrum across the world is allocated administratively. So, India is not doing anything different from the rest of the world. Conversely, if you do decide to auction it then you would be doing something, which is different from the rest of the world,"" the minister said.""That does not mean that spectrum does not come without a cost. What that cost is and what the formula of that cost is going to be, will not be decided by you or me ...it will be decided by Trai...and there is a paper that has already been circulated by Trai, and we have a regulatory authority for telecom, and that regulatory authority of telecom has been empowered by the constitution to decide what that administrative pricing is going to be,"" he said.","Telecom Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia said on Tuesday that such airwaves will be given out through administrative allocation and not auctioned.

“I think it’s a good idea to have

Facebook firing staff over $25 meal credit misuse leaves employees divided,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/facebook-firing-staff-over-25-meal-credit-misuse-leaves-employees-divided/articleshow/114350959.cms,"What is Grubhub meal perk at Meta

What Meta employees said

Meta 's recent termination of employees for allegedly misusing meal credits has sparked mixed reactions among the company workers. While some express sympathy for those fired, others believe the dismissals were justified. The parent company of Facebook and Instagram reportedly terminated the employment of approximately two dozen employees for violating company policy regarding the use of $25 daily meal credits.According to a report by Business Insider, Meta employees took to the anonymous workplace forum Blind to discuss the recent firings related to meal credit misuse. A poll on the platform, which requires a company email for access, asked employees to respond with whether they were “Safe from Grubgate” or “Affected by Grubgate .”The Grubhub meal perk is essentially a $25 daily meal credit that is intended to benefit employees working late or in offices without cafeterias. A recent report suggested that this perk was misused by some staff members to purchase non-food items like laundry detergent and wine glasses.Learning upon this, the company terminated the employment of about a dozen staff. The Business Insider report says that Meta appears to have taken action only against those who repeatedly abused the system. Those who were found to have violated the rules occasionally were reprimanded but not terminated.“These fools are so lucky… at least they know WHY they got laid off. Imagine having to wonder for the rest of your life where you went wrong,” one wrote, as per the report by Business Insider.“This action instils fear in employees. Anyone can violate a policy by mistake. It's like taking away your driving licence because you were going 55 instead of 50. I challenge anyone to say that they know ALL the policies this company has,” one employee said.“It's not weird. They violated a 'follow this rule or you will be terminated' policy, and they were terminated. There is nothing to worry about unless you are also violating company policies. The rules you need to follow to keep your job are all written out for you. Read them,” another one noted.One Meta employee wrote on the forum that he/ she used their Grubhub credit for a laid-off worker and received a “warning email.”“My Grubhub account got deactivated first and then my intern account,” the employee said in the forum.“Although Meta still thinks itself a large company of small entrepreneurship, with the 'year(s) of efficiency,' it's starting to take policy noncompliance of employees more seriously,” another one wrote.""Should folks [have] done a better risk assessment for their $25 dinners? Likely. Should Meta have requested the employee refund the company, put a block on the benefit, and delivered a one-more-strike-of-any-kind-you-are-out warning? Probably,” another employee added.",Facebook and Instagram parent company terminated the employment of approximately two dozen employees for violating company policy regarding the use of $25 daily meal credits.

The Karnataka government has introduced a new fee on transactions conducted through aggregator platforms like Zomato , Swiggy , Ola, Uber and others to fund social security measures for gig workers . The state government announced that the money collected will be used for the welfare of the gig workers.Karnataka Labour Minister Santosh Lad said, ""The Labour Department of Karnataka has decided to impose cess on every transaction on aggregators platforms like Zomato, Dunzo, Swiggy, Zepto , Ola and others such.The Money which will be collected will be used for the Welfare fund for Gig workers. We are not charging for products or goods which consumers purchase, wit will be charged only on transport.""Earlier today (October 18) it was reported by Moneycontrol.com that the state government is planning to levy welfare fee of 1-2 percent on Zomato, Swiggy, Zepto and other online platforms. The report said that the collected funds will be transferred to a dedicated welfare board to support gig workers engaged in delivery services.This fee will apply to all customers who transact on aggregator platforms, including Rapido, Dunzo, Zepto, Porter, Namma Yatri and others. So far there are no other details available about this Cess.The move comes in the wake of the government's draft Platform-Based Gig Workers (Social Security and Welfare) Bill, 2024, which aims to provide social security benefits to gig workers. The bill is expected to be presented in the state assembly during the winter session in December.While the fee will be collected by the aggregator platforms, it is very likely that will be ultimately be passed on to the customers, leading to a slight increase in the cost of services. This could potentially discourage frequent use of these platforms.The government has conducted extensive consultations with stakeholders, including aggregators, gig workers' unions, and industry associations, to finalize the details of the bill. Despite opposition from some aggregators, the government is determined to implement the fee to ensure adequate social security coverage for gig workers. Labour department officials said they conducted 32 rounds of meetings with stakeholders, including around 26 aggregators, gig workers' unions, civil society groups and lawyers. ""We also conducted inter-departmental discussions with the state Department of Information Technology and Biotechnology and organisations like NASSCOM (National Association of Software and Service Companies) and the CII (Confederation of Indian Industry). Members of the ILO (International Labour Organisation) also participated in the meetings,"" an official said.","The Karnataka government has introduced a new fee on transactions conducted through aggregator platforms like Zomato, Swiggy, Ola, Uber and others.

""Our plan to reaccelerate our business has delivered,"" he stated. Netflix reported $9.83 billion in revenue and $2.91 billion in operating income.The crackdown on password sharing seemingly paid off big time, driving subscriber growth and revenue. Over the past year, the streaming giant implemented strict measures to prevent users from sharing their account credentials with individuals outside their household. This move, which initially faced some backlash from users, required people to either pay for their own subscription or add extra members to their account for an additional fee.While the company didn't provide specific numbers on how many of these new subscribers were former password sharers, the surge in overall subscriber growth suggests that the crackdown has effectively pushed many freeloaders to become legitimate users.The ad-supported tier, launched in late 2022, has also become a significant driver of growth. Netflix reported that ad-supported memberships increased by 35% quarter-over-quarter. The company also saw a 150% increase in upfront ad sales commitments compared to the previous year, indicating growing advertiser interest in the platform.Netflix says that it plans to test an in-house ad tech platform in Canada later this year, with plans for a wider rollout in 2025. This would give the streamer more control over its advertising ecosystem and potentially increase its ad revenue.Netflix's growth was particularly strong in the Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) region, as well as in Asia-Pacific. However, the company reported a slight decline in subscribers in Latin America, its first drop in the region since early 2023.Despite the positive financial results, Netflix acknowledged some challenges in its content pipeline. The company described its 2024 programming as ""patchier than normal"" due to the impact of last year's Hollywood strikes . However, Netflix assured investors that production has picked up again and expects programming to return to normal state next yearSome of the titles that raked in the highest viewerships in the Q3 included ""The Perfect Couple"" and a new season of ""Emily in Paris,"" which helped drive engagement. Netflix also teased a strong Q4 lineup, including the return of ""Squid Game.""Netflix says that the average subscriber spends two hours per day on the platform.In addition to its traditional streaming offerings, Netflix is making significant strides into live content. The streamer is expanding into live programming , with plans to stream WWE's ""Monday Night Raw"" next year and the upcoming Mike Tyson vs. Jake Paul boxing match.","Netflix added around 5 million subscribers in the third quarter of 2024.

'No regulation of WhatsApp, Telegram and others a big security risk'

Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), who members include Airtel Reliance Jio and Vodafone-Idea , have once again called for regulation of OTT apps including WhatsApp, Telegram, Google Meet and others.During the inaugural session of India Mobile Congress in New Delhi, COAI Director General SP Kochhar said that the government needs to implement stricter regulations governing the entry and exit of data from domestic telecom networks, including those used by Over-The-Top (OTT) platforms.He said that the government has to take lead in setting up standards for security and industry will support it.Kochhar highlighted the challenges posed by the unregulated nature of OTT platforms. He pointed out that while telecom operators are subject to stringent regulations, OTT apps like WhatsApp, Telegram, and Google Meet often operate with minimal oversight. This, he argued, increases the risk of fraudulent activities and compromises user security.To address these concerns, COAI has proposed that the government introduce comprehensive regulations to govern the operations of OTT platforms within India. These regulations should ensure that OTT providers comply with Indian laws and adhere to cybersecurity standards.By implementing stricter data security measures and regulating OTT platforms, the government can help protect Indian consumers from cyber threats and maintain the integrity of the country's telecom infrastructure.","'No regulation of WhatsApp, Telegram and others a big security risk' says Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) COAI members include Airtel Reliance Jio and Vodafone-Idea.

Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff clearly isn't impressed with Microsoft Copilot. This can be said on the basis of the executive’s latest post on X in which he compared the AI-powered chatbot and interface with the discontinued intelligent user interface for Microsoft Office Clippy .“When you look at how Copilot has been delivered to customers, it’s disappointing. It just doesn’t work, and it doesn’t deliver any level of accuracy.Gartner says it’s spilling data everywhere, and customers are left cleaning up the mess,” Benioff said in a post on X.“To add insult to injury, customers are then told to build their own custom LLMs. I have yet to find anyone who’s had a transformational experience with Microsoft Copilot or the pursuit of training and retraining custom LLMs. Copilot is more like Clippy 2.0,” he added.Benioff’s post has reference from a report by Gartner, which highlighted potential security risks associated with Microsoft Copilot . The report, based on a survey of 132 IT leaders, found that concerns about data oversharing and security are causing many organisations to delay their Copilot deployments.While Gartner acknowledges that Copilot generally adheres to security protocols and user permissions, it warns that improper configuration or overly permissive access controls could lead to unintentional data exposure.“M365 Copilot honors user permissions. It also respects data security controls, such as sensitivity labels, where these have been correctly applied. However, if controls have not been correctly applied or permissions are too open, M365 Copilot can increase the risk of oversharing by retrieving, summarising and generating content that the user should not have access to. It could also surface content that should no longer exist,” said the August report titled “Copilot for Microsoft 365: Assessing the Impact and Value So Far.”Incidentally, this is the second time in a month that he has compared Copilot with the Office Assistant, with the first instance being at the Dreamforce conference in mid-September.Benioff dismissed competition posed by Microsoft and said “that Microsoft Copilot is basically the new Microsoft Clippy, that customers have not gotten value from it.”It’s “like we’re selling science projects to companies, and they’re tired of it. They’ve not gotten the value” from the technology, he added.","Gartner says it’s spilling data everywhere, and customers are left cleaning up the mess. “To add insult to injury, customers are then told to build their own custom LLMs. Copilot is more like Clippy 2.0,” he added.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114327062,imgsize-61443,width-400,resizemode-4/114327062.jpg"

Here are some of the user comments from poll

A recent poll conducted by the 'Startup India' community on Reddit has sparked discussion around leadership qualities in the Indian startup ecosystem . The poll, which saw participation from a significant number of users, revealed the community's picks for the ""Best"" and ""Worst"" Indian startup founders.Sridhar Vembu , the CEO of Zoho , emerged as the clear winner for ""Best Founder."" Users lauded Vembu for his contributions to job creation, his commitment to building a successful product, and his impressive business acumen.Zoho, a multinational software company, is known for its diverse range of products and services, making it a major player in the global tech landscape.Byju Raveendran , the CEO of edtech giant Byju's , received the dubious honour of being voted the ""Worst Founder."" Redditors criticised Raveendran for fostering a toxic work culture, misleading marketing practices, and questionable financial decisions. The company has also defaulted on large debt obligations in both the United States and India, leading to bankruptcy proceedings. These difficulties have resulted in large-scale layoffs, unpaid salaries, and a sharp decline in the company's valuation.“Its a tough contest between Byju Raveendran, Bhavesh Agarwal, and Rahul Yadav. Life rarely gives you second chances, especially after royal screw-ups. He somehow found a way to sabotage that too.”“Byju has to take this one. Its hard to piss off investors, customers, lawmakers across geographies and employees to the degree what he has managed to do”“Byjus Ravindran He is greedy and followed stupid practices to sell his product. ( Many parents stuck in debt and cried ). He put so much pressure on his employees and treated worst. He picked a fight with investors instead of being supportive who supported him in initial stages. He brought bad name to Indian startup system. He is WORST because he brought worst experience to customers, employees, Investors, Vendors and to country. Atleast others didn't disappoint atleast one stakeholder but he disappointed every stakeholder associated witht the company.”“It may be Byju.. he screwed everyone whom he hired. Probably misguided by Investors ..

Google CEO Sundar Pichai announces big change to the company's leadership; read his memo to Googlers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-ceo-sundar-pichai-announces-big-change-to-the-companys-leadership-read-his-memo-to-googlers/articleshow/114325939.cms,"long-time search head

Prabhakar Raghavan

will transition to the role of Chief Technologist

Google has appointed Nick Fox, a seasoned leader within the company's search and ads division

Here's the memo Google CEO Sundar Pichai sent to Google employees:

Hi Googlers,

It's been an exciting few days for AI across our products. We saw NotebookLM with Audio Overviews go viral, added more ways to find information in Search and Lens, and launched a revamped Google Shopping for the AI era. We also just shared a big milestone in our work to help doctors use AI to detect diabetic retinopathy: 600,000 screenings and counting, and we’re expanding access to more people across India and Thailand. There’s a lot more to come.

AI moves faster than any technology before it. To keep increasing the pace of progress, we've been making shifts to simplify our structures along the way, including the creation of Google DeepMind and the joining of the Platforms & Devices teams. As a next step, Prabhakar and I have been thinking through how to structure our Knowledge & Information team for the Gemini era, and today we shared the following changes:

The Gemini app team led by Sissie will join Google DeepMind under Demis. As the name suggests, the Gemini app is the direct consumer interface to the latest and greatest Gemini models. Bringing the teams closer together will improve feedback loops, enable fast deployment of our new models in the Gemini app, make our post-training work proceed more efficiently and build on our great product momentum.

The Assistant teams focused on devices and home experiences will move to Platforms & Devices so they can sit closer to the product surfaces they’re building for and bring our AI-powered home initiatives into one team and focus on improving user experience.

In parallel to this, Prabhakar has decided it’s time to make a big leap in his own career. After 12 years leading teams across Google, he’ll return to his computer science roots and take on the role of Chief Technologist, Google. In this role, he’ll partner closely with me and Google leads to provide technical direction and leadership and grow our culture of tech excellence. Nick Fox, a longtime Googler and member of Prabhakar’s leadership team, will be stepping up to lead K&I, which includes our Search, Ads, Geo, and Commerce products.

Prabhakar's leadership journey at Google has been remarkable, spanning Research, Workspace, Ads, and K&I. He led the

team in launching Smart Reply and Smart Compose as early examples of using AI to improve products, and took Gmail and Drive past 1 billion users. Across K&I, Prabhakar and team have achieved significant growth and innovation: from launching AI Overviews, a groundbreaking advancement in Search that benefits hundreds of millions of users worldwide to introducing new search modalities like Circle to Search, video understanding, and ""shop what you see"" in Lens — all while improving core Search functionality. Maps and Shopping have transformed with AI-driven features like immersive view and virtual try-on. And in Ads, we’ve made real progress with AI-powered ad formats and streamlined campaign management, while continuing to innovate with Performance Max to empower millions of businesses.

I’m so grateful to Prabhakar for the strong foundation and leadership bench he’s built across K&I. That includes his incredible senior leaders and Nick who is ready to hit the ground running in his new role as SVP of K&I!

Over the past few years, Nick has been instrumental in shaping Google's AI product roadmap and collaborating closely with Prabhakar and his leadership team on K&I's strategy. And throughout his career, Nick has demonstrated leadership across nearly every facet of K&I, from Product and Design in Search and Assistant, to our Shopping, Travel, and Payments products. He was also a pioneering leader in Ads, where he helped establish a rigorous quality and user-focused approach that remains key to our success. Nick has launched innovative consumer products like Google Fi and spearheaded complex initiatives such as RCS messaging. I frequently turn to Nick to tackle our most challenging product questions and he consistently delivers progress with tenacity, speed, and optimism.

Congratulations to Nick, and a heartfelt thank you to Prabhakar for his leadership through numerous technology shifts and for building a strong foundation for the future.
