Read Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman's memo on the future of AI companions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/read-microsoft-ai-ceo-mustafa-suleymans-memo-on-the-future-of-ai-companions/articleshow/113860953.cms,"Here's Suleyman's memo in full:

“We’re living through a technological paradigm shift. In a few short years, our computers have learnt to speak our languages, to see what we see and hear what we hear.

Yet technology for its own sake counts for nothing. What matters is how it feels to people and what impact it has on societies. It’s about how it changes lives, opens doors, expands minds, and relieves pressure. It is perhaps the greatest amplifier of human well-being in history, one of the most effective ways to create tangible and lasting benefits for billions of people.

And yet technology is, and must always remain, in service to humanity: an enabler, a path to deepening our common bonds and shared understanding, our energy and imagination, our creativity and capacity for everything from invention to forming relationships.

In the field of AI, we often get caught up in the technical details. We spend our time talking about parameters and compute. The focus is on training runs, data centres and the latest techniques. This is natural and inevitable when operating on the frontiers of something new, where the details do really matter. But I think it’s important that in doing all of this, getting stuck right into the technical weeds, that we don’t lose sight, not just of what we are building, but why we are building it.

At Microsoft AI, we are creating an AI companion for everyone.

I truly believe we can create a calmer, more helpful and supportive era of technology, quite unlike anything we’ve seen before. Great technology experiences are about how you feel, not what’s under the hood. It should be about what you experience, not what we are building.

Copilot will be there for you, in your corner, by your side, and always strongly aligned with your interests. It understands the context of your life while safeguarding your privacy, data, and security, remembering the details that are most helpful in any situation. It gives you access to a universe of knowledge, simplifying, and decluttering the daily barrage of information, and offering support and encouragement when you want it.

Over time it’ll adapt to your mannerisms and develop capabilities built around your preferences and needs. We are not creating a static tool so much as establishing a dynamic, emergent, and evolving interaction. It will provide you with unwavering support to help you show up the way you really want in your everyday life, a new means of facilitating human connections and accomplishments alike.

With your permission, Copilot will ultimately be able to act on your behalf, smoothing life’s complexities and giving you more time to focus on what matters to you. It will be an advocate for you in many of life’s most important moments. It’ll accompany you to that doctor’s appointment, taking notes and following up at the right time. It’ll share the load of planning and preparing for your child’s birthday party. And it’ll be there at the end of the day to help you think through a tricky life decision.

Some people worry that AI will diminish what makes us unique as humans. My life’s work has been to ensure it does precisely the opposite. We choose what we create. This is something we must do together. Our task is to ensure it always enriches people’s lives and strengthens our bonds with others, whilst supporting our uniqueness and endlessly complex humanity.

This is a new era of technology that doesn’t just “solve problems”, it’s there to support you, teach you, help you. In this sense, Copilots really are different to that last wave of the web and mobile. This is the beginning of a fundamental shift in what’s possible for all of us. It’s a long journey that will take years. With our latest updates to Copilot, you are seeing only the first careful steps in this direction.

Patience and care with our deployments are at the very foundation of our approach. My commitment is to be accountable at every stage, to work with you and listen to you. Respect and deep compassion for our users and for society is the core purpose behind everything we do. It comes first. This is a journey we promise to take together. I couldn’t be more excited to embark on it with you.

Amazon and Dell calls employees back to office full time

While tech giants like Amazon and Dell are calling employees back to the office full-time (5-days-a-week), Microsoft is taking a different approach. The company has announced that it will not require employees to return to the office unless their productivity drops, according to a report.Citing discussions in an internal meeting, Business Insider reported that Microsoft notes that this policy may change if employee productivity declines.This comes after the tech giant pitched hybrid work as a way to boost productivity and retain employees.According to two employees who were present, the announcement was made by Scott Guthrie, the executive vice president of Microsoft's cloud and AI group.Microsoft allows employees to work from home and sees it as a way to not only retain employees but also increase their productivity.“If you make the time to do it right, your employees will be more engaged, more productive, and more connected, even when they're miles away,” Keith Boyd, a Microsoft IT senior director, wrote in an August post about the hybrid-work approach.“And they'll be far less likely to leave for a competitor who has a more sophisticated and flexible model than you do,” Boyd added.Amazon and Dell are two tech companies that have recently mandated employees to work in the office five days a week. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy announced that starting January 2, 2025, corporate employees will be required to work in the office five days a week. Jassy believes that working in the office improves innovation, collaboration, and company culture.Meanwhile, Dell's global sales team is also required to work in the office five days a week, starting September 30, 2024, as it believes that working in the office is essential for collaboration and skill growth.",Microsoft has announced that it will not require employees to return to the office unless their productivity drops.

Tesla has adopted a controversial strategy to combat rising absenteeism at its Berlin gigafactory, according to a report by The Telegraph. The electric car manufacturer has started making home visits to employees who have called in sick, an unusual and controversial move aimed at addressing a growing problem at the facility.The absenteeism rate at Tesla’s Berlin gigafactory has seen a significant increase in recent months.In August 2024, around 17% of the facility's workforce reported being sick, a stark contrast to the 5% average absenteeism in the broader German car industry. This prompted Tesla to take action. The Berlin facility, which employs approximately 12,000 workers, has become a critical component of Tesla’s European operations, and maintaining efficiency is a priority for the company.In an effort to curb absenteeism, Tesla management began conducting home visits to employees who had called in sick. The factory manager, André Thierig, explained that the goal was to ""appeal to the work ethic of the workforce."" As part of the company’s broader strategy to encourage attendance, Tesla also introduced a €1,000 (£830) bonus for employees who maintain more than 95% attendance.The carmaking union IG Metall has pushed back against Tesla’s approach, arguing that the high rate of absenteeism is a symptom of overwork and unsafe working conditions at the Berlin gigafactory. According to the union, employees are struggling with the intense workload and the physical demands of their roles.Thierig, however, disputed this claim, stating that the rise in absenteeism is not indicative of poor working conditions, as the working environment remains consistent across all shifts. Instead, he suggested that the high absenteeism could be partly due to exploitation of the German social system, hinting that some workers might be taking advantage of the system.Elon Musk , Tesla's CEO, has a history of clashing with unions, and this situation in Germany highlights ongoing tensions. Thierig, reflecting the company’s tough stance on absenteeism, stated last year that Tesla would not tolerate workers who take advantage of their colleagues by skipping work without valid reasons. “There is no room in this factory for people who don’t get out of bed in the morning,” Thierig said, signaling that Tesla would take strong measures to ensure productivity.Tesla’s home visit policy has sparked mixed reactions among the workforce. While the company views it as a necessary step to reduce absenteeism and maintain operational efficiency, not all employees are on board. Reports have surfaced of staff members reacting negatively to the visits, with some reportedly slamming doors in the faces of Tesla representatives or threatening to call the police.","Tesla has adopted a controversial strategy to combat rising absenteeism at its Berlin gigafactory.

Take a look at the post here



Pokemon Scarlet and Violet players may face a new fiery challenge in early October as Infernape, the popular fourth-generation Fire-type starter, takes over Seven-Star Tera Raid dens. Infernape is a significantly tougher opponent than the previous Serperior. It is known for its high speed and powerful attacks and will reportedly replace Serperior the Unrivaled as the next formidable Tera Raid boss.While possessing a versatile move set and impressive offensive stats, trainers should be wary of its low HP and susceptibility to Water, Flying, and Ground-type attacks.According to a report by Serebii.net, the fighting against Infernape the Unrivaled will commence on Thursday, October 3 at 8:00 pm EST (5.30 am IST) and continue until Sunday, October 6 at 7:59 pm EST (5.29 IST). A second opportunity to face this challenging foe will be available the following week, from October 10 to 13 at the same time.In a post on social media platform X (earlier Twitter), Serebii.net shares all the details.Players can acquire Infernape in Pokemon Scarlet and Violet by catching a Chimchar in the Terarium's Polar Biome and evolving it. Prepare your teams and strategies to face this challenging opponent in the upcoming Tera Raids. The Infernape will boast the Rock-type as its Tera type and will reward successful trainers with the coveted Mightiest Mark.Just like previous Tera Raid bosses, Infernape the Unrivaled, will possess its Hidden Ability,Iron Fist , which will significantly amplify the power of its punching moves. Therefore, trainers should anticipate facing attacks like Mach Punch, Fire Punch, and Thunder Punch.Additionally, Infernape will utilise its Rock Tera type with moves such as Stone Edge or Rock Slide, potentially combining them with disruptive tactics like Taunt and Swords Dance. Despite the defensive nature of Rock-type Pokemon, Infernape's inherent fragility leaves it open to attacks from Water, Ground, and Fighting types.Trainers are advised to prepare their teams and strategies carefully to overcome this formidable opponent. Also, trainers preparing to challenge Infernape the Unrivaled should prioritise building teams with strong defences to withstand its powerful punches.","Pokemon Scarlet and Violet players may face a new fiery challenge in early October.

iPhone 15 scam: How a Bengaluru man caught fake Flipkart delivery man,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/social/iphone-15-scam-how-a-bengaluru-man-caught-fake-flipkart-delivery-man/articleshow/113840201.cms,"Take a look at the post here



Image: Reddit

Image credit: Reddit

A Bengaluru resident has exposed a delivery scam attempt. This scam involved a fake Flipkart delivery man who tried to deliver a fake package disguised as an iPhone 15. The resident, who had ordered an iPhone 15 with 256GB storage and opted for an open-box delivery , claims that a man dressed in a white t-shirt posed as a Flipkart delivery executive and attempted to hand over a sealed package.To prevent customers from receiving damaged or incorrect items, online retailers like Amazon and Flipkart often offer an ""open-box delivery"" option for high-value purchases. This allows customers to inspect the product before accepting the delivery, ensuring they receive exactly what they ordered. The imposter reportedly pressured the resident to accept the package without inspection, but fled the scene when the resident started recording the interaction.In the post, he wrote: “My sister bought an iPhone 15 with VIP on the Flipkart sale, it was an open box delivery. This loser (a guy in white) came with a big package to deliver claiming that he couldn't do an ‘open box delivery’. We have to accept it as is. I refused. He called some random people and they said there was no facility like that. He was scared shitless because I recorded all this. Telling his partners in crime in Kannada that I have recorded everything and all. I did not accept the package. Within two minutes another guy came to deliver a very small package and said that he would open the box before delivering it. We got the product because I recorded everything, otherwise I am sure he would have given me some random package.”At the end of the post also shared the pictures of the delivery executives . Here’s is the one who the customer flagged as a fake one:How users reacted to this postThe Reddit post got a lot of significant attention as it sparked a wave of users sharing similar concerns about trustworthiness and scams on online marketplaces . Many recounted their own experiences of receiving damaged, incorrect, or even empty packages despite opting for open-box deliveries.In the comments section, one user wrote: “Nice bro. Glad you knew something was off and recorded everything. It's very hard to trust Flipkart now. Their association with an insane amount of scammers in all delivery pipelines is really scary. It's really disturbing you know that Flipkart can't do or doesn't do anything about the scamming happening during the delivery.”Meanwhile, another user noted: “Just yesterday I received a laptop. Did an open box check, and even waited for the initial irritating Windows setup and upgrade to complete, to check that the processor and other details are as expected.In the past, Amazon sent me a laptop with a gen 4 i5 processor, instead of a gen 8, that I had ordered. And my stupid ass realised it after a year, when I ran some benchmarks.The Flipkart guy was obviously in a hurry, as I was clearly taking more time than I should have. (In my defence, I couldn't accept a 90k laptop, without being sure that it was the correct one)I finally have him 200 rupees, and then he was more than happy to wait for 45 minutes. He went ahead and made 2-3 more deliveries, then came back and took the OTP from me.I made a 40 minute long video, from the moment on unboxing, till verifying everything.The only reason I order costlier items from Flipkart and not Amazon, is for open box deliveries. If they do any drama in that, they can take it back.”",A Bengaluru resident has exposed a delivery scam attempt.

How govt has warned users against fake e-notices sent over email



iQOO India CEO, Nipun Marya , has issued a warning about a prevalent email scam targeting users across the country. In a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), Marya shared a screenshot of a fraudulent email falsely claiming to be from him. The email, riddled with grammatical errors and misspellings, attempts to deceive recipients by asking for a favour and requesting they refrain from calling as he is ""in a meeting.""The screenshot shared on X shows that mail was sent from Marya to a user named Siddhartha.However, the email ID from which it was sent -loiir56@dingtalk.com - looks shady and doesn’t seem to be associated with the CEO of iQoo India. This suggests that the mail wasn’t sent by Marya but by some scammer.In the mail body, the scammer wrote:Marya used the social media platform to warn users about such unsolicited emails and encourage vigilance, particularly when the messages contain threats or demands. This serves as a reminder to be cautious and verify the authenticity of emails before engaging or responding, especially those that seem suspicious or unusual.In July, the Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C), a unit under the Ministry of Home Affairs , warned citizens about a new wave of ""fake emails"" disguised as government e-notices. The I4C issued a public advisory urging individuals to be vigilant and verify the authenticity of any e-notice received via email. These fraudulent emails often mimic official government communications and may contain threats or demands to deceive recipients.To curb the rising threat of fake government e-notices, the I4C also outlined several countermeasures to help citizens protect themselves. The unit asked users to verify the sender's email address and ensure it ends with ""gov.in.""Secondly, the I4C also suggested users conduct online research to confirm the legitimacy of any officials mentioned in the email.Finally, the advisory also asked users to contact the relevant government department directly to verify the email's authenticity. With these simple steps, individuals can avoid falling victim to these deceptive scams.","iQOO India CEO, Nipun Marya, has issued a warning about a prevalent email scam.

"Tech CEO’s post on ‘firing employees’ creates stir, writes another to ‘clarify things: “...the actual message behind…”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/tech-ceos-post-on-firing-employees-creates-stir-writes-another-to-clarify-things-the-actual-message-behind/articleshow/113855565.cms,"What was the original message the CEO posted on LinkedIn

His post causes “a stir”

Oh man, my last post about firing created quite a stir …

… and I want to clarify some things:

To me, it is important to be transparent and openly talk about “taboos” like firing.

In said post, I tried to catch your attention by using a more serious photo and a rather controversial opening. Among many positive reactions, there were also a few concerned messages.

Unfortunately, this eclipsed the actual message behind my words: Firing is just as important as hiring.

Let me share some numbers:

𝗜𝗻 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗹𝗮𝘀𝘁 𝟭𝟮 𝗺𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗵𝘀, 𝘄𝗲 𝗵𝗮𝗱 𝗮 𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗻𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗿 𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝗼𝗳 𝗷𝘂𝘀𝘁 𝟱%—we had to let go 2 people because of work attitude and cultural fit. Standard literature and industry stats suggest that the usual turnover rate in IT is about 10-15%, sometimes even higher.

This shows us that we do a very good job at:

→ Hiring

→ onboarding people

→ caring for team wellbeing and

→ team development (including ongoing situational feedback).

𝗪𝗲 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗮 𝗽𝗲𝗼𝗽𝗹𝗲-𝗳𝗶𝗿𝘀𝘁 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗮𝗻𝘆.

We know that without the right people, we won’t achieve our goals.

𝗣𝗿𝗼𝘁𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝘀 𝗰𝘂𝗹𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗯𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗼𝗳 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘁𝗲𝗮𝗺 𝘁𝗼 𝗮𝗰𝗵𝗶𝗲𝘃𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗴𝗼𝗮𝗹𝘀, 𝗶𝘀 𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗽𝗿𝗶𝗼𝗿𝗶𝘁𝘆 #𝟭. To do that, we sometimes (and fortunately not often!) have to let someone go. And if we do, we do it in the most respectful way.

𝗟𝗲𝘁𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘀𝗼𝗺𝗲𝗼𝗻𝗲 𝗴𝗼 𝗶𝘀 𝗻𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗿 𝗲𝗮𝘀𝘆 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗻𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗿 𝘄𝗶𝗹𝗹 𝗯𝗲.

But it is a necessity and the better we are prepared, the better it is for the affected team members, the rest of the team, the hiring team, and the company culture.

And that’s why I believe we should talk about it more.

The CEO of a tech company recently shared a post on LinkedIn, saying that he is “really good at firing people” and that laying off employees is as important as hiring them. The post created a stir online with him claiming that he received concerned messages from his team.

What techniques hackers deployed to steal data

A cybersecurity company has spotted a malicious app on Google Play store that is designed to steal cryptocurrency. What makes this app so dangerous is that it has evaded detection for over 5 months before being removed from the store. It was first uploaded to Google Play in March 2024.According to a report by Check Point Research , a crypto drainer app named WalletConnect – Airdrop Wallet has targeted Android mobile device users exclusively and used modern evasion techniques by posting as a legitimate tool for Web3 apps to avoid detection.Notably, this fake app used the legitimacy of the WalletConnect protocol, which connects crypto wallets to decentralised apps. The hackers were able to steal around $70,000 (approximately 58.6 lakh) in cryptocurrency from victims in 5 months, the report said.Moreover, fake positive reviews and using the most modern crypto drainer toolkit helped the app achieve over 10,000 downloads by manipulating search rankings.Connecting with WalletConnect is often difficult for several reasons. One of them is that not all wallets support WalletConnect. There are times that users don’t have the latest version. Hackers reportedly exploited these complications and tricked users into thinking that the fake app provides an easy solution.Once users downloaded and launched the malicious WalletConnect app, they were prompted to connect their wallet. The hackers then used phishing websites and apps that mimic legitimate cryptocurrency platforms to fool users into authorising an illegitimate transaction from their crypto wallet, which allowed the drainer app to execute the transfer of digital assets to hackers.About 20 users whose money was stolen left negative reviews on Google Play but malware developers quickly flooded the page with fake positive reviews to mask the negative reviews, and make the app appear legitimate, to mislead other potential victims.","A cybersecurity company has spotted a malicious app on Google Play store that is designed to steal cryptocurrency.

I wrote to you some time ago about

cybercrime

and how it is on the rise. From phishing attempts to fraudulent schemes, scammers target ordinary individuals like you and me. And even the most tech-savvy folks often fall for it. It is time we all found a way to protect ourselves.

Nearly all such cyber frauds and crimes begin with a simple phone call or SMS. That's why, we, at Airtel, have decided to help address this growing menace. We believe, that as your network provider, enabling reliable connectivity implies that you enjoy a superior network experience but also feel secure when you use your phone.

What are we doing?

For the last 6 months, we have used our Network Intelligence and Al to analyze call patterns to accurately identify spammers on the network. This list keeps growing and so this exercise will be a continuous effort. Once identified, we tag/mark everyone of these numbers so that you automatically receive a ""Suspected Spam"" alert, when getting a call from such numbers. At the same time, you will also get a ""Suspected Spam"" alert on SMSes with malicious links or fraudulent content in them. And in the background, we will continue to work at identifying verified scammers and permanently blocking them from our network. Our new solution makes us India's 1st Spam Fighting Network and we hope you will feel more confident and secure every time you receive that spam call or message.

What do you have to do?

You do not have to do anything. This is an in-built service on our network and using it will be an seamless experience for you. No apps to download, no features to enable, no permissions to grant, and no extra charges to pay.

Our aim is to make these alerts a natural part of your mobile experience, so that each time you receive a call or SMS, you remain vigilant for the ""Suspected Spam"" indicator.

As always, I look forward to hearing your thoughts on what more we can do and how we can make your experience on our network even better.

In the meantime, stay safe. Stay vigilant.

Regards,

Gopal Vittal, CEO Airtel

Zoomcar cofounder Moran files plaint against firm over unpaid dues,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/zoomcar-cofounder-moran-files-plaint-against-firm-over-unpaid-dues/articleshow/113833554.cms,"Greg Moran , co-founder of the Nasdaq-listed self-drive car-sharing platform Zoomcar, has filed a complaint in the US court against Zoomcar India , Zoomcar Holdings, Sternaegis Ventures , and Aegis Capital Corporation , collectively referred to as Aegis defendants. The complaint alleges that Moran was dismissed from his position as CEO for cause, although no such cause has been specified thus far.Moran alleged in the complaint that defendants threatened him with termination of his CEO role if he did not give up rights in the employment agreement and agree to other terms of employment.According to Moran, he has not received the compensation due to him, which amounts to more than $238,000. This sum is overdue based on certain wage-related statutes and the provisions outlined in his amended and restated employment agreement dated December 22, 2023.Furthermore, the plaintiff claims that he has been denied the immediate vesting of his 8% fully diluted interest in Zoom India, which is a requirement of the employment agreement in the event of a non-cause termination. Moran’s 8% amounts to approximately 16 million shares.Zoomcar went public on the Nasdaq through the SPAC (Special Purpose Acquisition Company) route and raised about $230 million. The self-drive car rental startup was started by two college mates -- Moran and David Back – who dumped the idea of pursuing their fully-funded management degrees at the University of Southern California and Cambridge University's Judge School of Business respectively, to launch a car rental business, Zoomcar India, in Bengaluru in 2013. Back is no longer with the company.In 2022, the Aegis defendants actively pursued the process of taking the company public via SPAC. They explored a range of potential arrangements with various sponsor and investor groups. During each commercial structuring discussion, the Zoomcar board of directors consistently and unambiguously reaffirmed their commitment and obligation to maintain the plaintiff's ownership stake at ""8% fully diluted"" of Zoomcar's equity, the complaint said.This commitment was upheld regardless of the nature or approach of any corporate transaction or investment strategy. The Board made it clear that the plaintiff's ownership would remain unchanged, irrespective of the specific details or structure of the SPAC deal or any other investment avenue pursued by the company.The complaint also said, “..the Aegis defendants continued to engage in self-dealing in ways intended to further their own interests at the expense of Zoomcar, and to harm plaintiff personally. For example, in early 2023, chairman Levine demanded renegotiation of his director compensation. He demanded more than $500,000 in immediate cash compensation and a stock grant that would increase his ownership well above 1% of all Zoomcar. That ownership interest would have been higher than any other Zoomcar employee except for plaintiff and the cash compensation would greatly exceed that of all Zoomcar employees, including plaintiff,” the complaint showed. Waze co-founder Levine is the chairman of the board.An email sent to Zoomcar didn't elicit a response till the time of going to press.","Greg Moran, co-founder of Zoomcar, has filed a complaint in the US court against Zoomcar India, Zoomcar Holdings, Sternaegis Ventures and Aegis Capital Corporation.

Amazon India head Manish Tiwary leaves company: Read his ‘farewell’ message,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/amazon-india-head-manish-tiwary-leaves-company-read-his-farewell-message/articleshow/113827837.cms,"Here’s his farewell message on LinkedIn:

After an incredible eight-year journey at

India, it’s time for me to graduate and embark on a new adventure. This decision is bittersweet because Amazon has been more than just a workplace; it’s been a second home, a nurturing ground where I’ve grown both personally and professionally.

From the moment I joined almost a decade ago, Amazon welcomed me with open arms. I started by looking after a few categories and eventually led the India consumer business. The challenges were immense, but with the unwavering support of my amazing colleagues, who became like family, we overcame every obstacle and achieved remarkable success.

I’ll always cherish the memories of late nights spent in the war room during the Amazon Great Indian Festival, the celebrations after achieving seemingly impossible goals, and the laughter shared over countless cups of coffee. To my team members, thank you for your camaraderie, hard work, and dedication. I feel truly privileged to have had the opportunity to work with you, and I’m incredibly proud of what we’ve built together—transforming Amazon into ‘India Ki Apni Dukaan’ and making a positive impact on millions of customers and sellers.

As I graduate from Amazon’s ranks today, I’m filled with a deep sense of gratitude. Amazon has been a home away from home, a place where I’ve found purpose, passion, and a sense of belonging. Thank you for being a part of my journey. I would also like to express my sincere gratitude to

, Russell Grandinetti,Doug Herrington, and Andy Jassy for their leadership, support, and guidance throughout my time at Amazon.

While I’m excited for what the future holds, I can’t help but feel a tinge of sadness as I bid farewell to the place that has shaped me into the person I am today. Amazon, you will forever hold a special place in my heart. I proudly move on to the next phase of my life as an ‘

Amazon Graduate

’.

Lebanon explosions: Indian government's new CCTV rules means 'ban' on these Chinese companies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/lebanon-explosions-indian-governments-new-cctv-rules-means-ban-on-these-chinese-companies/articleshow/113826344.cms,"cctv in cbse school

While CP Plus is an Indian company while Hikvision and Dahua are Chinese players.

Chinese CCTV companies banned in the US

Indian government wants CCTVs only from 'trusted locations'

What are 'trusted locations'

The Indian government reportedly seems set to restrict the use of Chinese-made surveillance equipment in the country, following recent coordinated pager explosions in Lebanon. Multiple sources familiar with the matter revealed to The Economic Times (ET) that the government is set to accelerate the implementation of guidelines that favor local vendors in the surveillance market.""In light of the pager explosions, the government will be taking a close look at critical sourcing of certain components or parts of the supply chain,"" an industry source told ET.""The government's policy on surveillance cameras is likely to come into effect on October 8, which will effectively eliminate Chinese players from the market, benefiting Indian companies.""While the gazette notifications were issued in March and April of this year, sources stated that the government has expedited its implementation and sharpened its focus on security in the wake of the Lebanon explosions. The government is set to fast-track the implementation of guidelines on CCTV cameras, which will allow players from ""trusted locations"" to sell their products in India.According to Varun Gupta, research analyst at Counterpoint Research, ""Currently, CP Plus , Hikvision and Dahua control more than 60% of the market in India and they will have to step up their efforts in improving the localization content in their surveillance portfolio and double down on R&D..In November 2022, the United States government, through the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), banned the sale of equipment from Hikvision and Dahua due to ""unacceptable risks to national security"".The FCC declared the companies a threat to national security after concerns that their equipment could be used by China to spy on the US.Those in the know also said that lately, the Indian government has been rejecting Chinese CCTV equipment tenders and has been preferring European players like Bosch. Notably, it is estimated that Bosch is around 7-10x more expensive than its Chinese counterparts.""The emphasis on CCTVs predates the pager explosions,"" another person told ET. ""The guidelines on security certification were issued in March and will come into effect in October. It's less about explosions and more about the potential for data leakage from CCTV cameras, which are installed in sensitive locations and can be used to track people's movements. The government wants to ensure that only cameras from trusted locations are used.""A ""trusted location"" would be one where the Indian government has visibility on the entire manufacturing chain and is convinced that there are no backdoors in the equipment that could leak or take data out. While a ""rip and replace"" policy is not currently on the table, it remains a possibility for the future.Of the two separate gazette notifications that came out in March and April, one focused on "" Make in India "" guidelines for surveillance cameras, while the other addressed the criteria for CCTV certification. The orders from the government laid the foundation for changes in procurement of surveillance systems in India and placed a strong emphasis on promoting domestic products in the surveillance market.","The Indian government is set to accelerate the implementation of guidelines that favor local vendors in the surveillance market.
