Zoomcar cofounder Moran files plaint against firm over unpaid dues,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/zoomcar-cofounder-moran-files-plaint-against-firm-over-unpaid-dues/articleshow/113833554.cms,"Greg Moran , co-founder of the Nasdaq-listed self-drive car-sharing platform Zoomcar, has filed a complaint in the US court against Zoomcar India , Zoomcar Holdings, Sternaegis Ventures , and Aegis Capital Corporation , collectively referred to as Aegis defendants. The complaint alleges that Moran was dismissed from his position as CEO for cause, although no such cause has been specified thus far.Moran alleged in the complaint that defendants threatened him with termination of his CEO role if he did not give up rights in the employment agreement and agree to other terms of employment.According to Moran, he has not received the compensation due to him, which amounts to more than $238,000. This sum is overdue based on certain wage-related statutes and the provisions outlined in his amended and restated employment agreement dated December 22, 2023.Furthermore, the plaintiff claims that he has been denied the immediate vesting of his 8% fully diluted interest in Zoom India, which is a requirement of the employment agreement in the event of a non-cause termination. Moran’s 8% amounts to approximately 16 million shares.Zoomcar went public on the Nasdaq through the SPAC (Special Purpose Acquisition Company) route and raised about $230 million. The self-drive car rental startup was started by two college mates -- Moran and David Back – who dumped the idea of pursuing their fully-funded management degrees at the University of Southern California and Cambridge University's Judge School of Business respectively, to launch a car rental business, Zoomcar India, in Bengaluru in 2013. Back is no longer with the company.In 2022, the Aegis defendants actively pursued the process of taking the company public via SPAC. They explored a range of potential arrangements with various sponsor and investor groups. During each commercial structuring discussion, the Zoomcar board of directors consistently and unambiguously reaffirmed their commitment and obligation to maintain the plaintiff's ownership stake at ""8% fully diluted"" of Zoomcar's equity, the complaint said.This commitment was upheld regardless of the nature or approach of any corporate transaction or investment strategy. The Board made it clear that the plaintiff's ownership would remain unchanged, irrespective of the specific details or structure of the SPAC deal or any other investment avenue pursued by the company.The complaint also said, “..the Aegis defendants continued to engage in self-dealing in ways intended to further their own interests at the expense of Zoomcar, and to harm plaintiff personally. For example, in early 2023, chairman Levine demanded renegotiation of his director compensation. He demanded more than $500,000 in immediate cash compensation and a stock grant that would increase his ownership well above 1% of all Zoomcar. That ownership interest would have been higher than any other Zoomcar employee except for plaintiff and the cash compensation would greatly exceed that of all Zoomcar employees, including plaintiff,” the complaint showed. Waze co-founder Levine is the chairman of the board.An email sent to Zoomcar didn't elicit a response till the time of going to press.","Greg Moran, co-founder of Zoomcar, has filed a complaint in the US court against Zoomcar India, Zoomcar Holdings, Sternaegis Ventures and Aegis Capital Corporation.

Amazon India head Manish Tiwary leaves company: Read his ‘farewell’ message,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/amazon-india-head-manish-tiwary-leaves-company-read-his-farewell-message/articleshow/113827837.cms,"Here’s his farewell message on LinkedIn:

After an incredible eight-year journey at

India, it’s time for me to graduate and embark on a new adventure. This decision is bittersweet because Amazon has been more than just a workplace; it’s been a second home, a nurturing ground where I’ve grown both personally and professionally.

From the moment I joined almost a decade ago, Amazon welcomed me with open arms. I started by looking after a few categories and eventually led the India consumer business. The challenges were immense, but with the unwavering support of my amazing colleagues, who became like family, we overcame every obstacle and achieved remarkable success.

I’ll always cherish the memories of late nights spent in the war room during the Amazon Great Indian Festival, the celebrations after achieving seemingly impossible goals, and the laughter shared over countless cups of coffee. To my team members, thank you for your camaraderie, hard work, and dedication. I feel truly privileged to have had the opportunity to work with you, and I’m incredibly proud of what we’ve built together—transforming Amazon into ‘India Ki Apni Dukaan’ and making a positive impact on millions of customers and sellers.

As I graduate from Amazon’s ranks today, I’m filled with a deep sense of gratitude. Amazon has been a home away from home, a place where I’ve found purpose, passion, and a sense of belonging. Thank you for being a part of my journey. I would also like to express my sincere gratitude to

, Russell Grandinetti,Doug Herrington, and Andy Jassy for their leadership, support, and guidance throughout my time at Amazon.

While I’m excited for what the future holds, I can’t help but feel a tinge of sadness as I bid farewell to the place that has shaped me into the person I am today. Amazon, you will forever hold a special place in my heart. I proudly move on to the next phase of my life as an ‘

Amazon Graduate

’.

Lebanon explosions: Indian government's new CCTV rules means 'ban' on these Chinese companies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/lebanon-explosions-indian-governments-new-cctv-rules-means-ban-on-these-chinese-companies/articleshow/113826344.cms,"cctv in cbse school

Chinese companies that government's new rules will impact

While CP Plus is an Indian company while Hikvision and Dahua are Chinese players.

Chinese CCTV companies banned in the US

Indian government wants CCTVs only from 'trusted locations'

What are 'trusted locations'

The Indian government reportedly seems set to restrict the use of Chinese-made surveillance equipment in the country, following recent coordinated pager explosions in Lebanon. Multiple sources familiar with the matter revealed to The Economic Times (ET) that the government is set to accelerate the implementation of guidelines that favor local vendors in the surveillance market.""In light of the pager explosions, the government will be taking a close look at critical sourcing of certain components or parts of the supply chain,"" an industry source told ET.""The government's policy on surveillance cameras is likely to come into effect on October 8, which will effectively eliminate Chinese players from the market, benefiting Indian companies.""While the gazette notifications were issued in March and April of this year, sources stated that the government has expedited its implementation and sharpened its focus on security in the wake of the Lebanon explosions. The government is set to fast-track the implementation of guidelines on CCTV cameras, which will allow players from ""trusted locations"" to sell their products in India.According to Varun Gupta, research analyst at Counterpoint Research, ""Currently, CP Plus , Hikvision and Dahua control more than 60% of the market in India and they will have to step up their efforts in improving the localization content in their surveillance portfolio and double down on R&D..In November 2022, the United States government, through the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), banned the sale of equipment from Hikvision and Dahua due to ""unacceptable risks to national security"".The FCC declared the companies a threat to national security after concerns that their equipment could be used by China to spy on the US.Those in the know also said that lately, the Indian government has been rejecting Chinese CCTV equipment tenders and has been preferring European players like Bosch. Notably, it is estimated that Bosch is around 7-10x more expensive than its Chinese counterparts.""The emphasis on CCTVs predates the pager explosions,"" another person told ET. ""The guidelines on security certification were issued in March and will come into effect in October. It's less about explosions and more about the potential for data leakage from CCTV cameras, which are installed in sensitive locations and can be used to track people's movements. The government wants to ensure that only cameras from trusted locations are used.""A ""trusted location"" would be one where the Indian government has visibility on the entire manufacturing chain and is convinced that there are no backdoors in the equipment that could leak or take data out. While a ""rip and replace"" policy is not currently on the table, it remains a possibility for the future.Of the two separate gazette notifications that came out in March and April, one focused on "" Make in India "" guidelines for surveillance cameras, while the other addressed the criteria for CCTV certification. The orders from the government laid the foundation for changes in procurement of surveillance systems in India and placed a strong emphasis on promoting domestic products in the surveillance market.","The Indian government is set to accelerate the implementation of guidelines that favor local vendors in the surveillance market.

Key concerns raised by COAI include:

Contractual nature of telecom licenses

Exclusion of OTT services

Lack of financial reforms

Expanded scope for Internet Service Providers (ISPs)

Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), the apex telecom companies association in India, has expressed concerns over the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India's ( TRAI ) recent recommendations on the new service authorisation framework. The association, representing major telecom players like Reliance Jio Bharti Airtel , and Vodafone-Idea (Vi), believes that the proposed changes could negatively impact the industry's growth and investment climate.COAI has called on the government to address these concerns and ensure a healthy and robust environment for the telecom industry to thrive. The association remains committed to working with the government to find solutions that benefit both the industry and consumers.COAI emphasizes the importance of maintaining the contractual nature of existing telecom licenses. This ensures regulatory certainty and protects long-term investors. ""The DoT (representing the government) and the telecom operator are the two signatories of the same. Therefore, the authorisation process must continue to retain the contractual nature of the present licences, as this will ensure uniformity, regulatory certainty and protection to investors who commit long-term capital to the sector,"" said Lt Gen Dr. SP Kochhar, Director General, COAI.The association is concerned about the exclusion of over-the-top (OTT) communications services from the new framework. This could lead to an uneven playing field, as telecom service providers (TSPs) continue to bear significant compliance and security burdens.COAI believes that the TRAI's recommendations missed an opportunity to address the industry's financial challenges. The association has been advocating for reforms such as reduced license fees, abolition of the Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF) levy, and removal of performance bank guarantees.COAI is concerned about the expanded scope granted to ISPs under the new framework. This could unfairly disadvantage existing access and national long-distance (NLD) operators, who have made significant investments in the sector.","Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) has expressed concerns over the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India's ( TRAI ) recent recommendations on the new service authorisation framework.

Take a look at the post here



Pokemon Scarlet and Violet players may face a new fiery challenge in early October as Infernape, the popular fourth-generation Fire-type starter, takes over Seven-Star Tera Raid dens. Infernape is a significantly tougher opponent than the previous Serperior. It is known for its high speed and powerful attacks and will reportedly replace Serperior the Unrivaled as the next formidable Tera Raid boss.While possessing a versatile move set and impressive offensive stats, trainers should be wary of its low HP and susceptibility to Water, Flying, and Ground-type attacks.According to a report by Serebii.net, the fighting against Infernape the Unrivaled will commence on Thursday, October 3 at 8:00 pm EST (5.30 am IST) and continue until Sunday, October 6 at 7:59 pm EST (5.29 IST). A second opportunity to face this challenging foe will be available the following week, from October 10 to 13 at the same time.In a post on social media platform X (earlier Twitter), Serebii.net shares all the details.Players can acquire Infernape in Pokemon Scarlet and Violet by catching a Chimchar in the Terarium's Polar Biome and evolving it. Prepare your teams and strategies to face this challenging opponent in the upcoming Tera Raids. The Infernape will boast the Rock-type as its Tera type and will reward successful trainers with the coveted Mightiest Mark.Just like previous Tera Raid bosses, Infernape the Unrivaled, will possess its Hidden Ability,Iron Fist , which will significantly amplify the power of its punching moves. Therefore, trainers should anticipate facing attacks like Mach Punch, Fire Punch, and Thunder Punch.Additionally, Infernape will utilise its Rock Tera type with moves such as Stone Edge or Rock Slide, potentially combining them with disruptive tactics like Taunt and Swords Dance. Despite the defensive nature of Rock-type Pokemon, Infernape's inherent fragility leaves it open to attacks from Water, Ground, and Fighting types.Trainers are advised to prepare their teams and strategies carefully to overcome this formidable opponent. Also, trainers preparing to challenge Infernape the Unrivaled should prioritise building teams with strong defences to withstand its powerful punches.","Pokemon Scarlet and Violet players may face a new fiery challenge in early October.

Today, I celebrate 2 years of being in IndiGo (

InterGlobe Aviation

Ltd) and India. On our 18th IndiGo birthday last month, we celebrated many wonderful milestones and unveiled our ambitious plans for coming years. Our story has just started. I am grateful and proud to be a part of this incredible IndiGo journey with my colleagues - giving wings to the nation with over 2,000 daily flights, 430+ domestic and 100+ international routes, and growing every day.

When I had joined, I had shared the quote, ""Wherever you go, becomes a part of you somehow”. Being a part of IndiGo and now living now in India for two years....IndiGo and this beautiful country India have indeed become a part of me. Bharat ab ghar jaisa lagta hai.

India's essence is captured in its beautiful diversity. Of our 88 domestic cities, I had the pleasure of visiting our great teams in 30. From Thiruvananthapuram in the south to Leh in the north. My most recent visit was to Leh, where walking with my son at 18,000 feet at the Khardung La Pass was very special considering my roots are from a country where the highest ""hill"" is some 300 metres only and around 25% of the land is below sea level 😊

Here are some pictures from my travels in the last two years. Can you guess the cities?

Hi all,

I have something to share with you. After much reflection, I have made the difficult decision to leave OpenAl. My six-and-a-half years with the OpenAl team have been an extraordinary privilege. While I'll express my gratitude to many individuals in the coming days, I want to start by thanking Sam and Greg for their trust in me to lead the technical organization and for their support throughout the years. There's never an ideal time to step away from a place one cherishes, yet this moment feels right. Our recent releases of speech-to-speech and OpenAl 01 mark the beginning of a new era in interaction and intelligence - achievements made possible by your ingenuity and craftsmanship. We didn't merely build smarter models, we fundamentally changed how Al systems learn and reason through complex problems. We brought safety research from the theoretical realm into practical applications, creating models that are more robust, aligned, and steerable than ever before. Our work has made cutting-edge Al research intuitive and accessible, developing technology that adapts and evolves based on everyone's input. This success is a testament to our outstanding teamwork, and it is because of your brilliance, your dedication, and your commitment that OpenAl stands at the pinnacle of AI innovation. I'm stepping away because I want to create the time and space to do my own exploration. For now, my primary focus is doing everything in my power to ensure a smooth transition, maintaining the momentum we've built.

I will forever be grateful for the opportunity to build and work alongside this remarkable team. Together, we've pushed the boundaries of scientific understanding in our quest to improve human well-being. While I may no longer be in the trenches with you, I will still be rooting for you all. With deep gratitude for the friendships forged, the triumphs achieved, and most importantly, the challenges overcome together.

Mira



What OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said

Hi All

Mira has been instrumental to OpenAI’s progress and growth the last 6.5 years; she has been a hugely significant factor in our development from an unknown research lab to an important company.

When Mira informed me this morning that she was leaving, I was saddened but of course support her decision. For the past year, she has been building out a strong bench of leaders that will continue our progress.

I also want to share that Bob and Barret have decided to depart OpenAI. Mira, Bob, and Barret made these decisions independently of each other and amicably, but the timing of Mira’s decision was such that it made sense to now do this all at once, so that we can work together for a smooth handover to the next generation of leadership.

I am extremely grateful to all of them for their contributions.

Being a leader at OpenAI is all-consuming. On one hand it’s a privilege to build AGI and be the fastest-growing company that gets to put our advanced research in the hands of hundreds of millions of people. On the other hand it’s relentless to lead a team through it—and they have gone above and beyond the call of duty for the company.

Mark is going to be our new SVP of Research and will now lead the research org in partnership with Jakub as Chief Scientist. This has been our long-term succession plan for Bob someday; although it’s happening sooner than we thought, I couldn’t be more excited that Mark is stepping into the role. Mark obviously has deep technical expertise, but he has also learned how to be a leader and manager in a very impressive way over the past few years.

Josh Achiam is going to take on a new role as Head of Mission Alignment, working across the company to ensure that we get all pieces (and culture) right to be in a place to succeed at the mission.

Kevin and Srinivas will continue to lead the Applied team.

Matt Knight will be our Chief Information Security Officer having already served in this capacity for a long time. This has been our plan for quite some time.

Mark, Jakub, Kevin, Srinivas, Matt, and Josh will report to me. I have over the past year or so spent most of my time on the non-technical parts of our organization; I am now looking forward to spending most of my time on the technical and product parts of the company.

Leadership changes are a natural part of companies, especially companies that grow so quickly and are so demanding. I obviously won’t pretend it’s natural for this one to be so abrupt, but we are not a normal company, and I think the reasons Mira explained to me (there is never a good time, anything not abrupt would have leaked, and she wanted to do this while OpenAI was in an upswing) make sense. We can both talk about this more tomorrow during all-hands.

Thank you for all of your hard work and dedication.

"California governor vetoes AI bill: What it means for Google, Microsoft, Meta, OpenAI and other tech giants",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/california-governor-vetoes-ai-bill-what-it-means-for-google-microsoft-meta-openai-and-other-tech-giants/articleshow/113817513.cms,"Explained: What is Senate Bill 1047

What California Governor Gavin Newsom said

While well-intentioned,

SB 1047

does not take into account whether an Al system is deployed in high-risk environments, involves critical decision-making or the use of sensitive data. Instead, the bill applies stringent standards to even the most basic functions - so long as a large system deploys it. I do not believe this is the best approach to protecting the public from real threats posed by the technology.

California is home to 32 of the world's 50 leading Al companies, pioneers in one of the most significant technological advances in modern history. We lead in this space because of our research and education institutions, our diverse and motivated workforce, and our free-spirited cultivation of intellectual freedom. As stewards and innovators of the future, I take seriously the responsibility to regulate this industry.

By focusing only on the most expensive and large-scale models, SB 1047 establishes a regulatory framework that could give the public a false sense of security about controlling this fast-moving technology. Smaller, specialized models may emerge as equally or even more dangerous than the models targeted by SB 1047 - at the potential expense of curtailing the very innovation that fuels advancement in favor of the public good.

What it means for Google, Microsoft, and other AI companies

California Governor Gavin Newsom has vetoed a bill on artificial intelligence (AI) safety, noting the burden the bill would have placed on AI companies and criticising that the bill may be too broad. Senate Bill 1047 (SB1047), also known as the Safe and Secure Innovation for Frontier Artificial Intelligence Models Act, was passed by California's state legislature in August this year..The Senate Bill 1047 is aimed to make sure that really powerful AI systems are safe, mitigate the risks of “catastrophic harm” like creating dangerous weapons before their public release and hold developers accountable in case severe harm is caused by the models.The bill essentially targets big tech companies – like Google , Facebook parent Meta , Microsoft-backed OpenAI and others – that are developing powerful AI models. It focuses on AI models that cost a lot of money – over $100 million – to train and require massive computing power.Newsom said that the bill can “give the public a false sense of security about controlling this fast-moving technology” and that “adaptability is critical as we race to regulate a technology still in its infancy.”Here is excerpt from his statement:For major AI companies like Google, Microsoft , OpenAI, Meta and others, the veto of SB 1047 means they can continue developing and deploying large AI models without the stringent safety tests and liability measures that the bill would have imposed. This decision will essentially allow the tech giants to maintain their pace of innovation and avoid potential legal and financial burdens associated with the bill’s requirements.","California Governor Gavin Newsom has vetoed a bill on artificial intelligence (AI) safety.

How hackers are ‘using’ Apple and Microsoft to scam people online,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-hackers-are-using-apple-and-microsoft-to-scam-people-online/articleshow/113814278.cms,"AI is making these scams harder to spot

What to do in case you are scammed

Hackers are exploiting the names of trusted companies like Apple and Microsoft to defraud unsuspecting users, a report has said, adding that there has been a surge in tech support scams following the release of new products, like Apple's recent iPhone launch.“They use the reputation of the brand [for legitimacy purposes] to make it seem more real. Because, who doesn’t know Microsoft or Apple as a brand?,” said Cliff Steinhauer, director of information security and engagement at The National Cybersecurity Alliance, as per a report by CNBC.These scams often involve deceptive pop-up messages claiming that the potential victim’s computer is infected and urging them to call a provided number. These scammers aim to trick individuals into divulging sensitive information such as passwords, bank details, or other details – as they look to capitalise on the heightened interest.The report says that these scams are getting harder to spot despite people being made aware of them. These scams now utilise AI technology , especially when the scheme uses a known company logo, to make it look legitimate.There are multiple ways scammers are looking to target people. These include pop-up messages in emails and malvertising .Pop-up emails are a way of targeting people wherein hackers show urgency in emails, claiming that their system is compromised and in order for the user to continue using the system, they need to get it fixed. These phishing emails seem to come from legit places, including Microsoft, McAfee, PayPal and Norton but may be laced with malware.If an unsuspecting consumer clicks on a link, they are likely to be directed to a fake page where they will be asked to fill in their details. There may be an audio to support the scam, warning of an infection and instilling a sense of urgency.Meanwhile, malvertising is a practice where an advertisement laced with malware is shown to people when they search for a query on Google Search or Microsoft Bing. The report says that scammers pay for ads on search engines, and they appear as sponsored content during a query. For instance, someone searching for ""Microsoft support"" might encounter a fraudulent ad displaying a fake support number.If you believe that you have been scammed, you must change the username and password of your account for which you sought support for. Immediately call the bank and inform law enforcement authorities about the scam. Install a good antivirus protection on systems to fend off future attempts.","Hackers are exploiting the names of trusted companies like Apple and Microsoft to defraud unsuspecting users.

Significance of nicknames in tech company culture

Also read

In the competitive and fast-paced world of technology, companies strive to foster a distinct identity and culture. One interesting and increasingly common practice among tech giants is the assignment of unique nicknames to their employees. This tradition not only promotes a sense of belonging but also strengthens the internal brand culture. The use of nicknames often varies across firms, reflecting their values, goals, and history.Below is an exploration of some of the most notable tech companies and the nicknames used for their employees.At Google, one of the most recognizable tech companies in the world, employees are affectionately called ""Googlers."" This name represents a sense of belonging to the Google community and aligns with the company’s unique and innovative culture. New hires at Google receive a special designation as ""Nooglers."" This term represents ""new Googlers"" and is part of a tradition aimed at easing the integration of newcomers into the company’s distinctive environment. Departed employees of Google are referred to as ""Xooglers."" This clever nickname for former staff highlights Google’s continuing influence even after employees have left the organisation.At Amazon, the global e-commerce giant, employees are known as ""Amazonians."" The name is directly inspired by the company’s brand and reflects the grandeur and vastness of its global operations. The term is intended to invoke a sense of loyalty and community, underscoring the company's goal of continuous growth and innovation in various fields ranging from online retail to cloud computing.After Facebook rebranded to Meta in 2021, the company also introduced a new term for its employees: ""Metamates."" This name symbolises Meta’s core value of collective success and teamwork. The term emphasises the collaborative spirit within the company and the shared responsibility of employees to ensure both the company's and each other's success. Meta's culture page highlights the importance of this ethos, stating, ""We have a sense of responsibility for our collective success and to each other as teammates. It’s about taking care of our company and each other.""Employees at Microsoft are often referred to as ""Microsofties"" or simply ""Softies."" This lighthearted nickname reinforces the approachable and innovative culture that Microsoft aims to cultivate. Although the term has been in use for many years, it represents more than just a playful nickname—it reflects the company’s long-standing presence in the tech industry and its efforts to maintain a positive and creative work environment.Anthropic, an artificial intelligence research company, uses the nickname ""Ants"" for its employees. The term is derived from the idea of teamwork and cooperation, qualities commonly associated with ants in the natural world. This name symbolises the collective efforts of employees working toward advancing AI technology. While Mike Krieger, the company’s chief product officer, mentioned he might have preferred a different term, ""Ants"" remains the official moniker for staff, signifying unity and shared purpose within the firm.At Nvidia, a leading technology company specialising in graphics processing units (GPUs) and AI hardware, employees are called ""Nvidians."" This name stems from the company’s brand name, which in turn is inspired by the Latin word ""invidia,"" meaning ""envy."" Nvidia's founders initially used ""NV"" as a placeholder name before settling on the official branding. Today, ""Nvidians"" reflects a sense of pride in being part of an innovative firm that is constantly pushing the boundaries of computing technology.While Apple does not assign a specific nickname to its corporate employees, its retail employees, particularly those working in technical support, are referred to as ""Geniuses."" This title is used for the skilled technicians at Apple Stores who assist customers with hardware and software issues. The ""Genius"" title is part of Apple's effort to position its customer service team as highly knowledgeable and capable, ensuring that customers feel confident in their interactions with the company.Before Elon Musk’s acquisition and rebranding of Twitter as ""X,"" employees were commonly referred to as ""Tweeps."" This playful term derived from a combination of ""Twitter"" and ""people"" and reflected the company’s informal and collaborative culture. However, since the rebranding, the future of the nickname remains unclear. With the shift to ""X,"" it is uncertain whether a new moniker for employees will emerge, or if any nickname will be used at all. The lack of clarity about the term may symbolise the broader uncertainties surrounding the company’s ongoing transformation under Musk’s leadership.The trend of assigning unique nicknames to employees is more than just a quirky habit; it serves a larger purpose within tech companies. These nicknames help foster a sense of community, loyalty, and shared purpose, which can be crucial in building strong internal culture and identity. In an industry characterised by rapid innovation and intense competition, such practices can aid in employee engagement and retention.Furthermore, these nicknames are often tied to the company's brand and values. For example, Meta’s ""Metamates"" emphasises collective success, while Amazon’s ""Amazonians"" points to the vast and dynamic nature of its workforce. By adopting these names, companies give employees a sense of pride and belonging, reinforcing the idea that they are part of something larger than themselves.","Google, Microsoft, Apple, and other tech companies assign unique nicknames to employees.

Moo Deng’s influence beyond cryptocurrency



In the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrencies, meme coins have gained massive popularity, with the latest sensation being the Moo Deng coin . Inspired by a viral internet sensation — a two-month-old pygmy hippo from Thailand — this meme coin has taken the digital world by storm.Recently, a cryptocurrency user invested $1,300 (around Rs 1 lakh) in the Moo Deng coin on September 10, and their investment skyrocketed to over Rs 12 million over two weeks, translating to more than Rs 100 crore.The adorable hippo, known for her playful antics and charming looks, has inspired not only the creation of a meme coin but also a global beauty trend.Meme coins are cryptocurrencies that are often based on popular internet memes, animals, or viral sensations. Unlike traditional crypto assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum, meme coins thrive on community engagement and viral trends. Notable examples include Dogecoin , which was inspired by the Shiba Inu dog meme, and Shiba Inu coin itself. While many of these coins begin as jokes or light-hearted projects, their value can soar rapidly based on social media hype and internet culture.A cryptocurrency user, known by the username Lockchain, took to X (formerly Twitter) to share an astonishing investment journey. On September 10, the user invested $1,300 (roughly Rs 1 lakh) in Moo Deng coins, a cryptocurrency inspired by the internet's favourite pygmy hippo. Within just two weeks, the value of this meme coin surged dramatically, turning the initial investment into over Rs 12 million (around Rs 100 crore).The Moo Deng meme coin is the latest addition to the growing list of meme-based cryptocurrencies. It is named after a two-month-old pygmy hippo from Thailand, who gained internet fame for her small size and adorable appearance. Moo Deng’s viral videos, shared on platforms like Instagram and TikTok , captured hearts worldwide.The baby hippo’s name, which means ""bouncy pork"" in Thai, was chosen through an online poll in August 2024, further boosting her internet fame. In just 24 hours after its creation, the Moo Deng coin surged in value by over 90%, making it one of the fastest-growing meme coins of the year. The hippo’s viral status, combined with the appeal of meme coins, has resulted in an unexpected success for this digital asset.Moo Deng’s internet fame has not only impacted the crypto world but also inspired beauty trends globally. Beauty and makeup influencers are drawing inspiration from the hippo’s pink, chubby cheeks and smooth skin to create looks based on her adorable features. This trend has gained significant momentum on social media, with influencers from various countries paying tribute to the internet's beloved hippo.In an interview with The Guardian, Moo Deng’s zookeeper expressed her surprise at the pygmy hippo’s viral fame. She mentioned that from the moment she saw Moo Deng, she knew the hippo would become famous, but she had only anticipated popularity in Thailand, not internationally.","The Moo Deng meme coin is the latest addition to the growing list of meme-based cryptocurrencies.

Very few Americans realize that, if Trump is NOT elected, this will be the last election. Far from being a threat to democracy, he is the only way to save it!

Let me explain: if even 1 in 20 illegals become citizens per year, something that the Democrats are expediting as fast as humanly possible, that would be about 2 million new legal voters in 4 years.

The voting margin in the swing states is often less than 20 thousand votes. That means if the “Democratic” Party succeeds, there will be no more swing states!!

Moreover, the Biden/Harris administration has been flying “asylum seekers”, who are fast-tracked to citizenship, directly into swing states like Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin and Arizona. It is a surefire way to win every election.

America then becomes a one-party state and Democracy is over. The only “elections” will be the

Democratic Party

primaries. This already happened in California many years ago, following the 1986 amnesty.

The only thing holding California back from extreme socialism and suffocating government policies is that people can leave California and still remain in America. Once the whole country is controlled by one party, there will be no escape.

Everywhere in America will be like the nightmare that is downtown San Francisco.

Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk recently said that if Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is not elected in the upcoming US elections , this could be the last election in the country.

What the Flipkart sellers say

CCI investigation found Flipkart, Amazon giving undue preference

Flipkart, the Walmart-owned e-commerce platform, is at the center of a legal dispute as three of its online sellers have filed a lawsuit against the Competition Commission of India (CCI). The sellers are challenging an investigation conducted by the antitrust watchdog, which concluded that they, along with Flipkart and its rival Amazon , had violated competition laws in India, reports Reuters.Flipkart sellers seek to halt the investigation by CCI through legal action in the Karnataka High Court . Three vendors on the e-commerce platform have reportedly filed submissions requesting the court to ""set aside"" the investigation report and suspend the CCI's ongoing process, in an apparent attempt to suppress the critical proceedings.The lawsuit has been filed by three of Flipkart sellers - CIGFIL Retail , Wishery Online, Xonique Ventures . In their lawsuits, they argue that during the investigation they were called to submit data to help officials, but were later named as accused, which is against due process.""The alleged investigation ... is arbitrary, opaque, unfair,"" the sellers argued in three separate court filings, which will come up for hearing likely next week.The filings come after antitrust investigations concluded in August found that Amazon, Flipkart along with some of the sellers and smartphone brands give undue preference to select online sellers and prioritizing certain listings. The lawsuits filed by sellers could potentially delay the investigation process which first started in 2020, and was triggered after brick-and-mortar retailers of the Confederation of All India Traders complained to the watchdog.Last week, a former Amazon seller also sued the CCI and obtained an interim injunction to block the investigation from proceeding.","Flipkart sellers seek to halt the investigation by CCI through legal action in the Karnataka High Court.
