Seeing his dedication and love for his child was truly inspiring. We were honoured to offer her a small treat of babyccino, hoping to bring a little smile to her face. It reminded us of the strength and resilience of the human spirit, even in difficult times.

Cisco to layoff around 6,000 employees in its second round of job cuts

ShareChat cuts 5% jobs

Tech companies continued to cut jobs at a rapid pace in August 2024. More than 27,000 workers in the industry lost their jobs as big tech companies like Intel , IBM , Cisco , and even smaller startups, comprising a total of over 40 companies announced layoffs. So far in 2024, over 136,000 tech workers have been laid off by 422 companies.Intel announced it would lay off 15,000 employees, representing over 15% of its workforce, in a memo to employees on Thursday.The layoffs are part of a $10 billion spending reduction plan for 2025, following a dismal second-quarter earnings report and outlook.CEO Pat Gelsinger blamed Intel’s revenue growth shortfall on high costs and low margins, despite its leadership in the CPU chip revolution 25 years ago. Annual revenues fell $24 billion between 2020 and 2023, while its workforce grew 10% during the same period.Cisco Systems is laying off about 7% of its global workforce, affecting around 6,000 employees, as it shifts focus to high-growth areas like AI and cybersecurity. This marks Cisco’s second major round of job cuts this year.CEO Chuck Robbins remains optimistic about rebounding demand for Cisco’s networking equipment. Cisco is pivoting to capitalise on emerging technologies, having committed $1 billion to invest in AI startups and recently acquired cybersecurity firm Splunk for $28 billion.As part of the restructuring, Cisco plans to combine its networking, security, and collaboration departments into a single organisation.IBM is discontinuing its research and development operations in China, resulting in the displacement of over 1,000 employees as reported by Chinese media outlet Yicai.IBM has been grappling with a decline in demand for IT hardware and difficulties in expanding its presence in China, a market that once held significant potential and provided a robust business base beyond the United States. Despite these challenges, IBM has affirmed that these changes will not compromise its ability to support customers in China. The company will now prioritise serving private enterprises and select multinationals within the Chinese market.Infineon, a German chipmaker, will cut 1,400 jobs and relocate another 1,400 to countries with lower labour costs, its CEO Jochen Hanebeck said. The company’s third-quarter revenue fell short of expectations, prompting a downgrade of its full-year forecast for the third time in months. Hanebeck attributed the slow recovery in target markets to prolonged weak economic momentum and excess inventory levels.Popular action camera manufacturer GoPro has announced a restructuring plan that involves reducing its workforce and eliminating approximately 15% of its current headcount, about 14o employees. The layoffs are expected to be completed by the end of 2024, reducing operating expenses by $50 million from projected fiscal 2024 expenses. Apple has laid off about 100 employees in its services group, primarily impacting the Apple Books app and Apple Bookstore teams. Engineering roles were also eliminated. The layoffs come as Apple shifts resources towards AI programs, viewing Apple Books as less of a priority. Despite the cuts, Apple News remains a key focus.Layoffs are uncommon at Apple, but this is not the first round. Earlier this year, Apple laid off about 600 employees in its Special Projects Group due to project closures. In January, Apple shuttered a 121-person AI team in San Diego. As of its latest filing, Apple reported 161,000 full-time equivalent employees. Apple declined to comment on the layoffs.Dell Technologies is reorganising its sales teams, including a new AI-focused group. Sales executives Bill Scannell and John Byrne wrote in a memo that Dell is becoming leaner by streamlining management and reprioritizing investments. Rumours are that the company laid off about 12,500 employees, or 10% of its worldwide workforce, but the same could not be confirmed.ReshaMandi has reportedly terminated its entire workforce, as reported by sources to Entrackr. The firm’s website has been inaccessible for a week, coinciding with the resignation of its auditor. “It’s all over for ReshaMandi,” a source told the outlet. “The company is struggling to pay liabilities and bear operational costs including salaries for the past several months.”Brave, a web browser and search startup, has laid off 27 employees across departments, as confirmed by TechCrunch. PitchBook estimates Brave has around 191 employees, representing a 14% reduction. These layoffs follow a similar move in October 2023, when Brave cut 9% of its workforce due to cost management in a challenging economic environment.ShareChat, a Bengaluru-based social media company, laid off about 5% of its workforce, about 30-40 employees, after a bi-annual performance review in the month of August 2024.","Intel announces 15,000 job cuts as chipmaker goes through toughest time in its history.

Apple event next week: Biggest design changes coming to iPhone 16 series,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/biggest-design-changes-coming-to-iphone-16-series-more-screen-space-size-and-camera-placement/articleshow/113073101.cms,"Bezels Go Thinner

New Camera Layout with a Pill-Shaped Camera Bump

Larger Sizes for the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max

Two New Buttons

New Colors

Apple's iPhone 16 launch is likely right around the corner. Apple has sent out invites for “Glowtime” event on Monday September 9. While speculations suggest that Apple fans may have to wait longer for that 'Slim iPhone', there are likely to be some physical design changes in iPhone 16 series . This includes larger screens on the iPhone 16 Pro devices, thinner bezels and new camera design.Other than these there will be lots inside including new chip, brighter display, camera technology and more. Here we talk about the likely design changes.One of the most noticeable design changes in the iPhone 16 series is reported to be the significantly reduced bezel size, especially on the Pro and Pro Max models. This reduction in bezels will maximize the display area, providing users with more screen real estate and a more modern, sleek look.The iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus may feature a vertical camera orientation, similar to the iPhone 12 and 12 mini. This change is likely to accommodate spatial video recording, which can be viewed on the Vision Pro. Apple shifted from a vertical arrangement to a diagonal one starting with the iPhone 13 models. The company then said that doing so made it possible to fit a larger module in the device. So, while the exact reasons for the change is unclear, it's possible that the new orientation allows for a larger camera sensor.The iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max are expected to have larger screens compared to iPhone 15 series models. While iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max models have 6.1 and 6.7 inch screens, the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max might be 6.2 or 6.3 inch and 6.8 or 6.9 inch, respectively.The iPhone 16 series will introduce two new buttons: A replacement for the Mute Switch and a completely new button. Also, the Action Button in iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max models is likely to be expanded to the standard iPhone 16 models. This button can perform various functions like activating the Flashlight, turning on the Camera, launching Shortcuts, and more.While there have been conflicting rumors about the color options for the iPhone 16 series, it seems that the final choices colours may include black, green, pink, blue, and white. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo believes the iPhone 16 may not have the purple and yellow colour options.","Apple has sent out invites for “Glowtime” event on Monday September 9.

Microsoft’s hiring of Inflection staff: Company gets ‘second good news’ in 3 months,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsofts-hiring-of-inflection-staff-company-gets-second-good-news-in-3-months/articleshow/113071291.cms,"Why CMA cleared Microsoft’s hiring of Inflection staff

CMA gives green light to Microsoft-Mistral AI deal in May

Microsoft's decision to hire staff from the Inflection AI startup to join its new AI unit raised concerns in the UK, prompting an investigation into potential competition reduction. However, after a month-long initial inquiry, the UK's Competition and Markets Authority ( CMA ) has given Microsoft the green light, clearing the company of any wrongdoing in reducing competition.“The CMA has cleared Microsoft’s hiring of certain former employees of Inflection and its entry into associated arrangement with Inflection,” the regulator said.In March, the tech giant hired Mustafa Suleyman, co-founder of Google DeepMind , as head of its newly-created AI unit, along with a number of employees from the startup as a part of the deal which is reported to have cost the Windows-maker $650 million.The CMA had set a September 11 deadline to decide whether the investigation will progress into a second phase.According to a post by Joel Bamford, executive director, CMA, on LinkedIn, “the evidence did not show competition concerns requiring a more in-depth Phase 2 review”.“ Inflection AI is not a strong competitor to the consumer chatbots that Microsoft has developed directly (Copilot) and in partnership with OpenAI (ChatGPT). On this basis, we cleared the transaction,” he added.Back in May, the CMA announced it will not launch a formal investigation into the partnership between Microsoft and Mistral AI , a French AI startup that received a $16 million investment from Microsoft earlier this year.This decision came several weeks after the CMA sought feedback from the industry on the potential implications of this tie-up. Ultimately, the CMA concluded that the partnership didn't meet the criteria for a full-scale investigation under the UK's merger regulations.","UK's Competition and Markets Authority cleared Microsoft of any wrongdoing in reducing competition.

"After Google and Microsoft, this AI tool is preventing users from creating ‘fake' photos of US politicians",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/after-google-and-microsoft-this-ai-tool-is-preventing-users-from-creating-fake-photos-of-us-politicians/articleshow/113070597.cms,"Midjourney’s new policy for US elections



“I don’t really care about political speech. That’s not the purpose of Midjourney. It’s not that interesting to me. That said, I also don’t want to spend all of my time trying to police political speech. So we’re going to have put our foot down on it a bit. Anybody who’s scared about fake images in 2024 is going to have a hard 2028. It will be a very different world at that point. Like, obviously you’re still going to have humans running for president in 2028, but they won’t be purely human anymore.”

What researchers said about Midjourney’s previous policy



Artificial intelligence (AI)-based image generator Midjourney has reportedly started blocking users from creating ‘fake’ images of US politicians ahead of the upcoming presidential elections . According to a report by the news agency The Associated Press, attempts to generate images of prominent figures such as President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump have been unsuccessful. When users tried to create an image of ""Trump and Biden shaking hands at the beach,"" the tool displayed a “Banned Prompt Detected” warning.A second attempt led to an escalated warning stating, “You have triggered an abuse alert,” the report added.In a recent digital office hours event on Discord, Midjourney CEO David Holz addressed the users of the platform to announce that with the election in full swing, it’s time to “put some foots down on election-related stuff for a bit.” He also noted that “this moderation stuff is kind of hard,” however, he didn’t outline exactly what policy changes were taking place. He described the clampdown as a temporary measure to make it harder for people to abuse the tool.Holz said:With only 11 employees Midjourney has remained largely silent on the growing concern about how generative AI tools can be used to spread election misinformation. Unlike other major image-generating companies, Midjourney did not sign a voluntary industry agreement in February to address the issue of AI-generated deepfakes .A recent report by the Center for Countering Digital Hate found that Midjourney's tools are already being used to create misleading images that could support disinformation campaigns or false claims about elections.","Artificial intelligence (AI)-based image generator Midjourney has reportedly started blocking users from creating ‘fake’ images of US politicians ahead of the upcoming presidential elections.

Why Google's next big legal challenge may start this month,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/googles-next-big-legal-challenge-starts-this-month/articleshow/113069607.cms,"What US DoJ is investigating in Google’s ad business



What Google said about the upcoming trial



The US is set to launch a second antitrust case against Alphabet-owned Google next week. The trial, led by the US Department of Justice (DoJ), will scrutinise the advertising system that Google uses to generate revenue, which prosecutors claim negatively impacts news publishers. Scheduled to take place in Alexandria, Virginia, the trial will examine Google's technology that links website publishers with advertisers.In 2023, these tools were responsible for generating over 75% of Google's $307.4 billion advertising revenue.According to a Reuters report, the Justice Department and a coalition of states will seek to prove that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws through its digital advertising businesses. Regulators accused the company of dominating the market for digital ad technology by integrating its tools for publishers and advertisers, thereby securing a ""privileged position as the middleman.""The Justice Department alleged that Google controls 91% of the market for ad servers, over 85% of the market for ad networks, and more than half of the ad exchange market.Potential witnesses for the trial may include competitors such as Trade Desk and Comcast, as well as publishers like PubMatic. The case will also examine how Google's advertising technology has impacted news organisations.A study from Northwestern University published in November 2023 noted that one-third of U.S. newspapers have closed or been sold since 2005. Executives from News Corp, the Daily Mail, and Gannett, all of whom have also sued Google, could testify during the trial.A victory for the states and the Justice Department could pave the way for them to request that US District Judge Leonie Brinkema order a breakup of Google's business.Google has refuted these claims, arguing that it is not obligated to share its technological advantages with competitors and that its products are compatible with those from other companies.The company highlighted that its market share is 30% or less when accounting for advertising on social media, streaming TV, and apps. Google also contends that the Justice Department's focus on website ads overlooks the competitive landscape in these growing categories.The trial will scrutinise Google's perspective on its ad tech, with potential testimony from over two dozen current and former employees, including YouTube CEO Neal Mohan , a former Google advertising executive. The company has also emphasised its support for small businesses and publishers, some of whom it intends to call as witnesses.Google even warned that a breakup could ""slow innovation, increase advertising costs, and make it more difficult"" for small businesses to grow.","The US is set to launch a second antitrust case against Alphabet-owned Google next week.

In the early hours of the morning, a devastating fire severely damaged the Church of the Immaculate Conception in Saint-Omer, France. This historic 19th-century church, known for its exquisite neo-Gothic architecture, suffered extensive damage as the blaze engulfed the building, leading to the collapse of its iconic steeple and bell tower. The fire, which required the efforts of over 90 firefighters to control, has left the community in shock.Fortunately, no injuries were reported, but the loss to this architectural gem is immense.The Church of the Immaculate Conception, completed in the late 1800s, is celebrated for its neo-Gothic design, which includes soaring spires, intricate stone carvings, and stunning stained glass windows. The church has long been a symbol of Saint-Omer's rich cultural and religious heritage. Its towering steeple and bell tower were among its most distinctive features, drawing visitors and worshippers alike. The destruction of these elements marks a significant loss for both the local community and architectural enthusiasts worldwide.The news of the fire quickly spread, catching the attention of many, including tech billionaire Elon Musk. Musk, known for his active presence on social media, reacted by sharing a video of the burning church on his platform X (formerly Twitter). In his post, Musk raised the question of whether the fire could have been an act of arson, sparking widespread discussion and speculation online. His post has garnered significant attention, with many users engaging in the debate over the possible causes of the fire.Following the incident, France’s Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin expressed his condolences to the Catholics and residents of Saint-Omer, acknowledging the profound loss to the community. He assured the public that a thorough investigation is underway to determine the cause of the fire. While no official statement has been made regarding the possibility of arson, the investigation will explore all potential leads to uncover the truth behind this tragic event.The fire at the Church of the Immaculate Conception has left the residents of Saint-Omer grappling with the loss of a beloved landmark.

In the aftermath of the fire, the local community has rallied together, expressing their grief and support for efforts to rebuild and restore the church.As the investigation continues, there is hope that the cause of the fire will be determined, allowing the community to begin the healing process. Whether the fire was a tragic accident or the result of foul play, the loss of such an important cultural and religious site is deeply felt. The future of the Church of the Immaculate Conception remains uncertain, but the resolve of the Saint-Omer community to preserve their heritage is clear.In the days to come, the focus will likely shift to recovery and rebuilding efforts, with the possibility of international support for the restoration of this historic site.

Pavel Durov, CEO of Telegram , has recently become the subject of widespread speculation after older photos of him resurfaced online. These images have led many to wonder whether the billionaire entrepreneur underwent plastic surgery to enhance his appearance. Adding to the intrigue, Durov was recently arrested in France, raising further questions about the man behind the popular messaging app.Pavel Durov, a 39-year-old entrepreneur originally from Russia, is best known as the founder and CEO of Telegram, a messaging app launched in 2013.Telegram quickly gained popularity for its strong emphasis on user privacy, offering end-to-end encryption and other security features that set it apart from competitors. As of now, Forbes estimates Durov's net worth to be around $15.5 billion. Despite his success in the tech industry, Durov has managed to maintain a relatively low profile—until now.Durov's recent arrest in Paris has added a new layer of complexity to his public image. He was detained in France on charges of suspected complicity in running an online platform involved in illicit activities, including child exploitation, drug trafficking, and fraud. While these allegations are serious, it is the sudden focus on Durov's physical transformation that has captured the internet's attention.Pavel Durov has been active on social media platforms like Instagram since 2011, regularly sharing photos from his travels around the world. In his recent posts, Durov appears with a full head of hair and a toned physique, often posing shirtless in various locations. However, these recent images stand in stark contrast to older photos where Durov was seen with a noticeably receding hairline.The drastic change in his appearance has fueled rumours that Durov may have undergone plastic surgery, including a possible hair transplant. A popular post on X (formerly Twitter) by a well-known account shared a side-by-side comparison of Durov's old and new photos, sparking a flurry of online discussions. The post reads, ""Pavel Durov (Telegram CEO) before his hair transplant and plastic surgery,"" and has since gone viral.The speculation around Durov's transformation has been met with a variety of opinions online. On Reddit, users have debated whether the changes in Durov's appearance are the result of surgical procedures or simply better grooming and styling.One Reddit user commented, ""This isn't a hair transplant. His hair is too thick and full to have this kind of drastic change from a HT. Most likely he's wearing a hair system (wig).""Another user added, ""There's speculation that it's not a transplant, but rather a hair system because his hair loss was much more advanced in the first picture, so when the operation happens, the resulting hairdo never looks as full as his.""Some users believe the changes are the result of plastic surgery, with one theorising, ""This is well-done surgery.""However, not everyone is convinced that surgery is involved. One Reddit user opined, ""Honestly, I think a lot of the facial 'changes' are simply due to the much better angle and lighting in the second photo.""As the speculation continues, it's clear that Durov's transformation—whether natural or assisted—has caught the public's eye. The intense scrutiny of his appearance highlights the challenges that come with being in the spotlight, especially for someone as private as Durov. Whether or not he has undergone any procedures, the discussions around his looks reflect a broader societal fascination with image and success.","Pavel Durov, 39, is the founder and CEO of Telegram, a messaging app launched in 2013.

When Tesla CEO Elon Musk called Ratan Tata a “gentleman and …”,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/when-tesla-ceo-elon-musk-called-ratan-tata-a-gentleman-and-/articleshow/112903343.cms,"Tata Nano and the Indian automobile market

Elon Musk praised Ratan Tata

The legacy of the Tata Nano

Also read

In the realm of business and innovation, few figures command as much respect as Tata Group chairman emeritus Ratan Tata. His influence extends far beyond the Indian corporate world, even garnering admiration from Tesla CEO and X owner Elon Musk . In a 2009 interview with American journalist Charlie Rose , Musk praised Ratan Tata as a ""gentleman and a scholar."" This moment has recently resurfaced, shedding light on Musk's appreciation for Ratan Tata and his ambitious project, the Tata Nano .The Tata Nano was introduced by Tata Motors in 2008 as the world's cheapest car, with a price tag of just Rs 1 lakh (approximately $2,300 at the time). The car was a pet project of Ratan Tata, designed to make automobile ownership accessible to millions of Indians who had never been able to afford a car. The idea was revolutionary—a small, affordable car that would cater to the vast Indian middle class, providing them with a safe and efficient means of transportation.In the interview with Charlie Rose, which took place shortly after the launch of the Tata Nano, the Tesla CEO was asked about his views on Ratan Tata’s efforts to introduce a low-cost car in India. The interview clip, which has recently gone viral, captures Musk's candid response.""Take for a moment Ratan Tata, what he’s doing in India — developing a little sedan for $2300. Where do you put that in the whole equation of where the future of cars is?"" asked Rose.Musk responded with a mix of admiration and caution. He began by acknowledging the brilliance behind the Tata Nano project and the character of Ratan Tata himself.""I think it's a good idea to have affordable cars, but I think the problem with something like the Nano ... I wouldn't say problem because I think, by the way, it is probably a great idea and Ratan is a gentleman and scholar,"" Musk said.However, Musk also expressed his concerns about the long-term viability of such a low-cost vehicle, particularly in the context of rising fuel prices. He pointed out that while the initial purchase cost of the Nano was remarkably low, the cost of running the car—particularly fuel costs—could become a significant issue as gasoline prices continued to rise.""But where it’s going to become challenging in the future is when the price of gasoline rises, the cost of acquiring the car is much less of an issue than the cost of running the car,"" the billionnaire explained.Despite the initial excitement surrounding the Tata Nano, the car faced numerous challenges. One of the most significant issues was its branding. While the Nano was intended to be an affordable vehicle for the masses, it was often labeled as ""cheap"" rather than ""affordable."" This perception problem, combined with safety concerns and competition from other small cars, led to unimpressive sales figures.The Nano’s production was ultimately discontinued in 2018, marking the end of what was initially seen as a groundbreaking project. The car's journey from inception to discontinuation is often cited as one of the biggest marketing failures in the automobile industry.","The Tata Nano was introduced by Tata Motors in 2008 as the world's cheapest car, with a price tag of just Rs 1 lakh (approximately $2,300 at the time) The car was a pet project of Ratan Tata, designed to make automobile ownership accessible to millions of Indians who had never been able to afford a car.
