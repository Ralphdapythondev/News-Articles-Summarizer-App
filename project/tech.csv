OpenAI delays advanced Voice Mode for ChatGPT: Here’s when it may release,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/openai-delays-advanced-voice-mode-for-chatgpt-heres-when-it-may-release/articleshow/111272790.cms,"Here’s what OpenAI said on X

We're sharing an update on the advanced Voice Mode we demoed during our Spring Update, which we remain very excited about:

We had planned to start rolling this out in alpha to a small group of ChatGPT Plus users in late June, but need one more month to reach our bar to launch. For example, we’re improving the model’s ability to detect and refuse certain content. We’re also working on improving the user experience and preparing our infrastructure to scale to millions while maintaining real-time responses.

As part of our iterative deployment strategy, we'll start the alpha with a small group of users to gather feedback and expand based on what we learn. We are planning for all Plus users to have access in the fall. Exact timelines depend on meeting our high safety and reliability bar. We are also working on rolling out the new video and screen sharing capabilities we demoed separately, and will keep you posted on that timeline.

ChatGPT’s advanced Voice Mode can understand and respond with emotions and non-verbal cues, moving us closer to real-time, natural conversations with AI. Our mission is to bring these new experiences to you thoughtfully.

OpenAI has delayed the rollout of upgraded Voice Mode on ChatGPT . Introduced last month, the company’s new large language model (LLM) - GPT4o features a conversational Voice Mode that can deliver fast responses and natural interactions.It was expected to be released to a small group in late June. But, the voice mode has now been delayed, as announced by the company in a post on X, formerly Twitter.In the post, OpenAI said that it needs “one more month to reach our bar to launch.'' The company said that it is working on improving the model’s ability to detect and refuse certain content.“We’re also working on improving the user experience and preparing our infrastructure to scale to millions while maintaining real-time responses.”","ChatGPT’s advanced Voice Mode can understand and respond with emotions and non- verbal cues, moving us closer to real-time, natural conversations with AI.

Google DeepMind study: These deepfakes are the most 'dangerous' form of AI use,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-deepmind-study-these-deepfakes-are-the-most-dangerous-form-of-ai-use/articleshow/111267362.cms,"Examples of deepfakes for misinformation during elections

AI-generated "" deepfakes "" impersonating prominent figures like politicians and celebrities are a more prevalent threat than using AI for cyberattacks, a study by Google’s AI division, Google 's DeepMind, has said.The study, conducted alongside Jigsaw – Google's research and development unit, analysed roughly 200 cases of AI misuse reported between January 2023 and March 2024. Social media platforms, Reddit, online blogs, and media reports were all sources for these incidents. The Financial Times reported on the research.The second most frequent motive behind misuse was financial gain, either through creating deepfakes (including non-consensual nudity) or generating large volumes of content like fake news articles.The study found that creating fake images, videos and audio content (deepfakes) was nearly twice as common as the second-highest misuse – generating misinformation through text-based tools like chatbots.The most common goal of actors misusing generative AI was to shape or influence public opinion – accounting for 27% of uses.Recent examples include deepfakes of UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak appearing on social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram ahead of the upcoming general election.Ardi Janjeva, research associate at The Alan Turing Institute, said that the contamination of publicly accessible information with AI-generated content could “distort our collective understanding of sociopolitical reality”.“Even if we are uncertain about the impact that deepfakes have on voting behaviour, this distortion may be harder to spot in the immediate term and poses long-term risks to our democracies,” Janjeva added.“There was concern about sophisticated cyberattacks using these tools,” said lead author Nahema Marchal of Google DeepMind . “Instead, we observed more common misuses like deepfakes, which might be overlooked.”The study found most incidents involved readily available tools, requiring little technical expertise, potentially increasing the pool of bad actors misusing generative AI.","Google study analysed 200 cases of AI misuse reported between January 2023 and March 2024.

IRCTC wants you to remember these 3 important things while booking tickets; and believe no other 'viral news',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/irctc-has-a-clarification-on-booking-e-tickets-for-family-friends/articleshow/111267259.cms,"What the ‘false’ news claim



Here’s the complete notice:

The news in circulation on social media about restrictions in booking of e-tickets due to different surnames is false and misleading.The concerned should be discouraged from spreading such false news.It is clarified that tickets from IRCTC site are being booked as per

Railway Board Guidelines

and required information is available on the public domain as under:

1. One can book tickets on personal User ID for friends, family, and relatives.

2. Booking can be done for up to 12 tickets per month which in case of

Aadhaar-authenticated users

can go up to 24 tickets per month, if one of the passengers on a ticket is also aadhar authenticated.

3. Tickets booked on personal User IDs are not meant for commercial sale and such an act is an offense under section 143 of Railways Act 1989.

Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation , or IRCTC , has debunked the ‘news in circulation on social media’ in which it is being claimed that iIf you book train tickets for your friends or relatives with different surnames, you can end up in jail or fined Rs 10,000.

Integrate data sources to become a sustainable business,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/integrate-data-sources-to-become-a-sustainable-business/articleshow/111270409.cms,"There is enormous pressure on businesses to become sustainable today. Prioritising the bottomline over long-term sustainable practices is no longer tenable and can in fact lead to more environmentally-conscious competitors having an edge. That's what experts in the field told us on a webinar last week.Achieving a sustainable business model requires a lot of planning and, most importantly, adequate, reliable, real-time data . Getting the right data is by far one of the most common problems businesses face when starting out on their sustainability journeys, says Chittaranjan Meher, country leader of the sustainability software business unit for IBM India/South Asia.""Without comprehensive data integration , you cannot accurately track and manage sustainability metrics. That's why we're helping customers collect data through different sources and integrate it.""Chittaranjan says IBM's Maximo application suite allows businesses to manage their assets more efficiently, predict and prevent breakdowns, and maintain compliance with safety and regulatory guidelines, all by gathering data from the right sources.Indigrid operates and manages power transmission networks and renewable energy assets throughout India. The company's chief operating officer, Satish Talmale, says it's critical to collect data in an efficient and sanitised manner so that the data is structured and usable.""We have operational technology systems like SCADA (computer-based system for gathering and analysing real-time data) and other business platforms wherein data comes through sensors and is automatically fed. And there are a few sets of data that come in through manual input - via iPads or mobile devices.""This integration of disparate data sources allows Indigrid to do amazing things, says Satish - like cutting down fewer trees. ""Vegetation is a big challenge we encounter because if a tree height goes beyond a certain clearance, the power line will trip. So, we use drone and satellite-based monitoring to get data and then run image analytics on it, which tells us exactly when a tree will grow to be a problem. It's a scientific method that allows us to cut 100 branches of trees instead of a thousand.""Chittaranjan says professionals should consider getting into the rapidly growing sustainability sector. ""We think this is the decade of sustainability because everybody has done their digital transformation already, the next transformation they are doing is sustainability. The requirement for sustainability professionals is very high,"" he says.","Sustainability requires a lot of planning and adequate, reliable, real-time data.

From curing toothache to helping develop drugs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/from-curing-toothache-to-helping-develop-drugs/articleshow/111270389.cms,"Vijaygeeta Raju was a dentist , but after a decade of hectic practice, she felt she must do something else that would allow her more time for herself and her family. So she wrote the Karnataka government's civil service entrance exam.Since the results' declaration was taking time, Vijaygeeta started studying online courses on the use of technology in the pharma and healthcare sector. She studied pharmacovigilance , the science of identifying, assessing, and preventing adverse effects of medicines and vaccines. She trained in databases like Argus, Sceptre, and Google's GCP. And she got a job in this area with IQVIA (formerly QuintilesIMS), where she had to feed in patient data and produce reports on the efficacy of drugs .""In hindsight, I was glad I did not sit waiting for the civil services exam results. I would not have been so satisfied with my job if I had taken it because the government would transfer me from time to time. That would have meant staying away from family,"" Vijaygeeta says.As it happened, the civil services exam was cancelled because of some malpractice, and even though Vijaygeeta re-appeared for the test and probably would have got a government job, she had by then made up her mind on staying with pharmacovigilance.She says the journey from being a dentist to a pharmacovigilance officer transformed her from being an introvert and one filled with self-doubt to a more confident, outgoing and risk-taking person.Work would take her to Belgium where, for the first time, she stayed away from her family and home responsibilities. She went on a solo Europe trip. Around this time, she also learnt Lean Six Sigma and got a project management certification.Though she does not do any coding, over the years, her job has taught her the basics of coding and AI, which she says helps when she interacts with coders in the process of making devices.After four years with IQVIA, she had short stints with BioQuest Global Solutions and Celegence, and then Indegene, where she spent another four years. In 2020, she moved to Siemens Healthineers, where her work today involves telling the technology team if a solution would make a difference to the lives of patients, the clinical outcomes, and how regulators in India would take it. ""Knowing how to work with databases has eased the process of not just pulling out structured and unstructured clinical data, but also analysing it in a way that other teams can use it to make devices and drugs more useful to patients,"" she says.She gets to leave the office early and spend her evenings with the family. She's now upskilling to understand the structure of large language models and how these models could help build better devices.","Vijaygeeta Raju studied pharmacovigilance, the science of identifying, assessing, and preventing adverse effects of medicines and vaccines.

How NatWest's India GCC is helping transform the bank,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-natwests-india-gcc-is-helping-transform-the-bank/articleshow/111270350.cms,"Punit Sood is the head of India for NatWest Group, one of the biggest banks in the UK. He's been at the bank now for over four years, prior to which he had stints with Citi Technology Services, and JP Morgan Services India. NatWest's India centres across Gurgaon, Chennai and Bengaluru - which provide core technology and operations services - today have over 17,000 employees, close to 30% of the bank's global strength. The leaders of many key functions sit out of India. A lot of this movement of work from the UK has happened over the past few years. And Punit says it wasn't initially easy to convince his headquarters that India could do it.He recollects it took him 18-20 months to convince his UK bosses that there was no reason to have the final signing off authority on simple matters like an address change or replacement of a damaged debit card sitting in the UK, when the India centres were the ones processing the entire issue, right from the time the customer logs it in. ""They said this touches the customer, and so the final signing off must happen in the UK,"" he says.The India team persisted. For one of the smaller processes, the team demonstrated their capability to ensure that all metrics around turnaround times were delivered. When that was proved, they did it for more processes.Today, the global head of what NatWest calls Everyday Banking sits in India. Everyday Banking deals with all the daily issues that come up for a retail bank. ""Everyday Banking is a very big thing. It even deals with mortgage customers. If a mortgage customer comes and says they want to prepay, they have two choices - prepay and reduce the tenure, or prepay and reduce the principal, but keep the tenure the same. We help UK customers with all of such issues,"" Punit says.A host of other leadership functions, both in technology and operations, now sit out of India because much of the work around it happens here. This includes the head of digital platforms, head of core trading solutions, head of physical channels, head of regulatory reporting, and head of data engineering and digital analytics.Dhiraj Anand is head of retail digital X and retail banking operations in India, focusing on engineering and innovation, and developing digital insights. He says the larger vision is to make NatWest a digital bank. One of his major initiatives out of India has been to move the bank's contact centre agents in the UK to the AWS platform, allowing the bank to benefit from cloud and SaaS platforms, including using data better. Another big effort is around automating processes. ""My role includes all of tech and all of operations for retail banking. Since we have operations teams in India, servicing things like opening of accounts and handling complaints, I can get tech teams to work with these ops teams to understand what customers want. We are continuously improving processes for account opening, mortgages, handling complaints,"" he says.Automation of some of the more complex processes, he says, has resulted in 30-35% reduction in effort and time. ""In one of the processes, the (internal) user had to initially refer to almost 50 screens for every request - this has been reduced to five screens,"" he says.The India team has led the development of the bank's AI digital assistant called Cora. Cora enables self-service for customers. Last year, Cora handled 10.8 million retail banking conversations (up 400,000 compared to 2022), and almost half of these conversations required no human intervention.Now, the team is working with colleagues in the UK, and with IBM to develop Cora+, which will allow customers to ask questions and receive responses in a more conversational style. Cora+ will also be able to access information from multiple secure sources that were previously inaccessible through chat alone.India is also working on a unified customer engagement platform, and the first service from that will be a new real-time appointment booking service which is expected to reduce booking times by up to 75%, and is estimated to help unlock about 88,000 hours of employee time.Punit, who previously also led Nasscom's GCC (global capability centre) council, says what NatWest has done in India, is what other GCCs are increasingly doing. ""There's a lot more cross-pollination too now, with newer GCCs learning from existing ones. And they are starting with the intent of building an innovation centre in India (not a back-office operation),"" he says.","Punit Sood is the head of India for NatWest Group, one of the biggest banks in the UK.

X's advertising woes

Linda Yaccarino , the CEO of Elon Musk-owned X (formerly Twitter) fired her right-hand man Joe Benarroch and replaced him with a senior company employee, a report has said. Benarroch was fired in early June and Nick Pickles has now assumed his role, the report added.A report by The Financial Times, Benarroch – who was the head of business operations and communications at the company – was fired in part for allegedly failing to inform the public about the rollout of X's new adult content policy .The new policy on adult content – that has existed on the platform for a long time – makes it clear that such photographs and videos are allowed as long as it's consensual. Other rules include a ban on obscene behaviour on the platform.X also says that it will restrict exposure of such content to children as well as for those who don't want to see it.

Paytm founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma’s job cuts warning



Several Paytm employees who have been laid off have reportedly filed complaints with the ministry of labour and employment alleging that the fintech company has made ""unlawful termination"" without proper compensation. The complaints, filed between June 1 and June 12, seek reinstatement.Moneycontrol said that it accessed a copy of the filed complaint on the ministry's Samandhan portal and the same has been also verified by an official.The complaints claim that the Paytm management conducted unfair and unethical termination practices. Employees have also included supporting documents, including emails and official records with the complaints. While the report hasn’t revealed the exact number of complaints, some claim that it could be around 50.While some ex-employees said that they are waiting for a response from the ministry, a few others said that they were forced to resign.“We are awaiting a response from the Ministry and hope the case will be taken up by them. If not satisfactory, will take the court route,” said one of the employees, who claimed to have been terminated by Paytm without compensation or justification.Some employees have alleged being forced to ""voluntarily resign"".“My HRBP reached out to me yesterday (June 20) saying if I don’t resign by 12pm today (June 21), I will be terminated. I will take up the legal route as soon as possible. A few others are planning to do the same while some are already in the process,” another one said.In a letter to its shareholders last month, Paytm founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma acknowledged the company's first-ever sales decline. As per Sharma, the company is implementing cost-cutting measures targeting employee expenses, aiming to save Rs 400-500 crore annually.""One97 Communications Limited (OCL) is providing outplacement support to employees which have resigned as a part of the restructuring efforts by the company,” the company previously said.“As we harness AI capabilities and enhance governance structures, we are fully committed towards building our business according to regulatory compliances,” the Paytm letter added.Sharma also noted that the company will move forward with a “leaner organisation structure.” Apart from suggesting job cuts, Paytm also said that it will trim its non-core assets.","Several Paytm employees who have been laid off have reportedly filed complaints with the ministry of labour and employment.

Melinda stepped from Gates foundation after the divorce

Bill Gates divorced his ex-wife Melinda French Gates in 2021. Years later, Melinda French Gates has opened up about her divorce with the Microsoft co-founder. In an interview with Time Magazine recently, she described the end of 27-years marriage as ‘a painful and horrible experience’.“Getting a divorce is a horrible thing. It’s just painful. It’s awful when you realize you need one,” she said. Although later she corrected 'horrible' to 'hard', but added that things are wonderful now that it’s over.During the interview, Melinda Gates also talked about how getting divorced in a pandemic helped the couple get privacy. “It gave us the privacy to do what needed to be done in private,"" she told Time.She also reflected on being able to navigate the process while taking care of children. “You know, I separated first before I made the full decision about a divorce. And to be able to do that in private while I’m still trying to take care of the kids, while still making certain decisions about how you’re going to disentangle your life - thank God,"" she said.The divorce led her to step away from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in May this year, three years after the divorce. During the interview, she told Time that she thought about the effect of divorce on the foundation.""I thought a lot about my three children. But I certainly thought about the effect on the foundation. Those are the three biggest buckets: me, the kids, and the foundation. And I wanted to make sure that when we came through it to the other side - all of those pieces were intact.”Melinda also explained that she does not see her decision to exit the foundation as ‘downsizing’. “I don’t see it honestly as a downsizing ...I was just ready to be able to have full decision-making control about where all the funds go,” she said.","Melinda French Gates has opened up about her divorce with the Microsoft co- founder.

Save money on your OTT subscriptions with these best tips,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-tips/save-money-on-your-ott-subscriptions-with-these-best-tips/articleshow/111267043.cms,"Tips to slash your OTT subscription costs

Evaluate your subscriptions

How often do you use each service?

Are there overlapping content offerings?

Which services offer the most value for your viewing preferences?

Take advantage of free trials

Bundle subscriptions

Share subscriptions with family and friends

Look for discounts and promotions

Opt for ad-supported plans

Downgrade to a lower tier

Cancel unused subscriptions

Take advantage of yearly plans

Keep an eye on price increases

Rotate OTT subscriptions based on content releases

Use cashback and reward programs

Use public libraries

Monitor your viewing habits

In the age of streaming, Over-the-Top (OTT) platforms have completely transformed the way we consume entertainment. These platforms offer a vast array of content, from movies and TV shows to documentaries and live sports, making it possible to access virtually any type of entertainment on demand. The convenience and variety offered by OTT services have led to their widespread adoption, and many households now subscribe to multiple streaming platforms to cater to diverse viewing preferences.However, with the increasing number of available options, managing multiple subscriptions can become overwhelming and costly. Each platform typically requires a separate subscription fee, and these costs can quickly add up, putting a strain on your budget. Moreover, the abundance of content across various services means that it's easy to subscribe to more than you actually need or use, leading to unnecessary expenses.Fortunately, there are several strategies you can employ to save money on OTT subscriptions without sacrificing your viewing experience. By being strategic about your subscription choices and making the most of available offers and features, you can enjoy your favourite shows and movies while keeping costs under control.The first step towards saving on OTT subscriptions is to evaluate your current subscriptions. List all the streaming services you subscribe to and consider the following:By assessing your usage and preferences, you can identify subscriptions to cancel or downgrade. If you rarely watch content on a particular platform, consider cancelling it and redirecting those funds to a service you use more frequently.Many OTT platforms offer free trials for new users, ranging from a week to a month. Use these free trials to explore different services and their content libraries without committing financially. Set reminders to cancel the trial before it ends to avoid charges. You can also take turns using free trials from different platforms to enjoy their content without paying for multiple subscriptions simultaneously.Many streaming services provide bundled packages that combine multiple subscriptions at a reduced price. For instance, Disney+ offers a bundle that includes Hulu and ESPN+ for less than the cost of subscribing to each service separately. Search for bundles that match your viewing habits and preferences to save money.Many OTT platforms permit multiple profiles or simultaneous streaming on various devices. Utilise this feature by sharing subscriptions with family members or friends. Split the cost of a subscription among multiple users to reduce individual expenses. Check each platform's terms of service to ensure you are not violating any rules.Watch for discounts and promotions from OTT platforms, as many services provide special deals during holidays, anniversaries, or other significant events. Additionally, some platforms provide discounts for students, military personnel, and senior citizens. Sign up for newsletters or follow the platforms on social media to stay informed about upcoming promotions.Many streaming services provide ad-supported plans at a reduced cost compared to their ad-free versions. Although watching ads might be a slight inconvenience, it can lead to substantial savings. Evaluate whether ad-supported plans are a viable option for you, especially if the cost difference is substantial.If you don't need all the features offered by your current subscription tier, consider downgrading to a lower tier. If you're currently subscribed to a premium plan that includes 4K streaming but primarily watch content on a standard HD screen, transitioning to a standard plan could be a cost-saving option. Evaluate your viewing habits and requirements to decide if downgrading to a lower-tier plan would meet your needs effectively.Over time, it's common to collect multiple subscriptions, some of which may remain unused. Regularly assess your subscriptions and cancel those that are no longer in use. This straightforward action can redirect funds to more worthwhile purposes. Be vigilant about monitoring cancellation deadlines to prevent unnecessary charges for services you no longer require.Choosing a yearly plan instead of monthly subscriptions can lead to significant savings. Numerous OTT platforms offer discounts on annual subscriptions, equating to several months of service for free compared to monthly rates. Opting for a yearly plan is a prudent decision if you anticipate long-term use of a service, ensuring cost-effectiveness in the long run.Streaming services occasionally increase their subscription prices. Stay informed about upcoming price hikes and evaluate whether the service still offers good value at the new rate. If a price increase makes a subscription less affordable, consider switching to a different service or taking advantage of available promotions.The content offerings on OTT platforms are dynamic, regularly updating with new movies and shows while removing others. To optimise your savings, consider rotating your subscriptions according to the release schedules of your preferred content. Subscribe to a service for a period, enjoy the content you want, then cancel and switch to another platform. This method ensures you only pay for subscriptions when actively watching content that aligns with your current interests.Certain credit cards and cashback apps provide rewards for streaming service transactions, allowing you to earn cashback or points that can be used towards future subscriptions. Additionally, several OTT platforms have referral programs that offer incentives such as free months of service for referring new subscribers. These programs can help you maximise savings and get more value out of your streaming subscriptions.Several public libraries collaborate with streaming platforms like Kanopy and Hoopla to provide complimentary access to their services. Contact your local library to inquire about available OTT services, enabling you to enjoy a wide selection of movies and shows at no extra expense.Finally, paying attention to your viewing habits can assist you in making well-informed choices regarding your subscriptions. Monitor the time you spend on each platform and the types of content you enjoy the most. This data can help you select subscriptions that are not only cost-effective but also cater to your entertainment preferences effectively.","In the age of streaming, Over-the-Top (OTT) platforms have completely transformed the way we consume entertainment.

Apple Intelligence launch in China may face these three ‘challenges’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-intelligence-launch-in-china-may-face-these-three-challenges/articleshow/111147927.cms,"Tough rules for AI models

Ban on ChatGPT, which will be integrated in Apple devices

Privacy, a core focus for Apple

China has tough rules for AI models

Ban on OpenAI’s ChatGPT in China

Private Cloud Compute

Apple has announced Apple Intelligence , a suite of AI features that will run on iPhones, iPads and Mac PCs. The AI features will be available later this year to users globally, including China – one the most critical markets for the company. However, the company’s big AI push may face some challenges in China as regulators have in place strict rules around the technology amid tough competition.The three challenges that the company may face in China are (via CNBC):China’s AI market is tightly regulated and all companies launching AI models must have approval from the regulators for the commercial use of LLMs. The country has also made it mandatory for Generative AI providers to take down “illegal” content.Since some of the features of Apple Intelligence are developed by the company itself, Apple will likely need to get its AI model approved by authorities under Chinese rules.China has also banned OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Some of Apple’s voice assistant Siri’s capabilities are dependent on ChatGPT. This could mean that Apple may have to find a local AI company that provides the same level of capabilities as ChatGPT. Baidu and Alibaba are among China’s technology giants that have their own LLMs and voice assistants.Apple's AI launch highlighted a focus on user privacy. Their new system, Private Cloud Compute, processes user data on Apple-owned servers, with the company claiming the data itself is not stored.However, in China, Apple's iCloud data is stored on servers located locally and operated by a third party. This may raise concerns about whether Apple can maintain complete control over its AI computing servers in the country.This means that Apple must have a similar partnership for its AI servers in the region to keep user data private.","Apple has announced Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI features that will run on iPhones, iPads and Mac PCs.

TCS sees headcount fall first time in 19 years

India's largest IT services company Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is facing a significant challenge filling a massive number of open positions. During a town hall earlier this month, the global operations head of TCS ' resource management group (RMG) Amar Shetye revealed that the company currently has thousands of open positions that it is not able to fill due to the skills gap.Shetye put the number at 80,000. For those unaware, the RMG team at TCS is responsible for allocation of available resources to various projects across the company and in case of any shortfall, fill such requirements through contractors. These contractors are on the roles of the hiring agencies and may or may not be hired as permanent staff by the company.Skills gap, here means, a mismatch between the skills possessed by employees and those their roles demand.An employee who attended the townhall anonymously told TOI, ""We were told that either skillsets or employee aspirations are not matching project requirements. However, at TCS, no associate is forced to take on a project if they are not comfortable with it.""""He told us that we should consider ourselves fortunate that the firm is not laying off employees for not being mapped to any project unlike other firms,"" another employee on the bench added.The company’s recent annual report revealed that 33% of job requirements are currently being met by grooming existing talent.Post the announcement of fourth quarter results, TCS CEO K Krithivasan said that the company has built one of the largest artificial-intelligence-ready workforces in the world. ""TCS is currently working over 200 engagements in GenAI with our clients and foresees a promising pipeline of future work across all industries,"" he wrote.TCS posted strong performance in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 2024-25. ""This is a quarter of strong deals and execution for us. Continuous focus on operational excellence helped us achieve a 26% operating margin."" The management also said that deal wins were ""across markets, industries and geographies.""The Mumbai-headquartered company said that it had signed new deals totalling $13.2 billion in the fourth quarter, which is one of the highest ever for the company even as it signalled a cautious turnaround for the industry. The company added that the pain may be bottoming out and FY25 will be better than FY24.TCS's Gen-AI deal pipeline is said to have touched $900 million. “Our Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) pipeline has surged to $900 million, marking a doubling in value. The Total Contract Value (TCV) of the deal comprises primarily standard-sized deals, with the exception of a significant win secured in Q3,"" the company said in its earnings report.TCS' full year headcount fell for the first time in 19 years. The company reported a quarter-on-quarter decline of 1,759 in its headcount for the fourth quarter of FY2024-25.

Starting June 25, HDFC Bank will stop sending text alerts for low-value UPI transactions. This means that HDFC Bank customers will receive SMS alerts for UPI transactions exceeding Rs 100 when sending money and similar notification for when received is above Rs 500. However, the bank will continue to send email alerts for all transactions with no absolutely change.In a mail as well as SMS alert sent to its customers, HDFC Bank said: “Starting from 25th June, 2024: Email Alerts: Continue to receive email alerts for all UPI transactions. SMS Notifications: Now only for transactions above Rs 100 (money sent/paid) and Rs 500 (money received).”This change aligns with banking norms, which require text messages for transactions over Rs 5,000. Despite this, many banks send alerts for lower-value debits as well. HDFC Bank stated that feedback indicated alerts for low-value transactions were deemed 'not useful,' as there is often duplication of notifications from UPI payment apps.Bankers noted that bulk text messages cost between Rs 0.01-0.03 each. With UPI transactions averaging around 40 crores per day, banks collectively spend several crores daily on text message alerts.Banks are also promoting the use of UPI Lite for transactions up to Rs 500. UPI Lite allows a small amount of money to be set aside by the app, facilitating quick payments without the need for second-factor authentication.By reducing the frequency of low-value transaction alerts, HDFC Bank and others aim to streamline notifications for customers while also cutting costs.
