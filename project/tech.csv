Nvidia's rise to the top of the tech industry is attributed to the explosion of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology. While known for their graphics processing units (GPUs) for gaming, Nvidia has cleverly positioned themselves for the future as their GPUs turned out to be perfect for the complex calculations needed in AI tasks like training large learning models.Companies like Google , Microsoft , Amazon and Meta are all heavily reliant on Nvidia's H100 AI chips , which are specifically designed for AI applications, offering significant performance boosts compared to traditional CPUs.However, with high demand and limited supply, some tech giants have either already announced or are looking to launch their own AI chips to have an edge. Here’s a list of companies that have their own AI chips or are working on bringing them in the near future to reduce the dependency on Nvidia.Google has been making and relying on custom-designed tensor processing units (TPUs) to power its AI models. Their latest chip, Trillium , announced at Google I/O event in May, boasts a claimed five times the performance of its predecessor, TPU v5e. Companies like Assembly AI, Hugging Face, and Anthropic utilise Google's TPUs.Microsoft announced the Azure Maia 100 AI chip last year and it is designed to run cloud-based AI workloads. Currently in testing with Bing AI chatbot, GitHub Copilot, and OpenAI's GPT-3.5-Turbo language model, Microsoft is already developing a successor.AWS Trainium is the machine learning (ML) chip that AWS purpose built for deep learning (DL) training. Last year, the company unveiled Trainium2 which is claimed to deliver up to 4x faster training performance and 3x more memory capacity compared to first generation Trainium chips. Anthropic, with a $4 billion investment from Amazon in March, plans to leverage the tech giant's AI chips.Facebook-parent Meta is focusing on AI and in April, it revealed plans for “Artemis,” a second-generation AI chip surpassing their initial Meta Training and Inference Accelerator (MTIA) product launched last year.“This chip’s architecture is fundamentally focused on providing the right balance of compute, memory bandwidth, and memory capacity for serving ranking and recommendation models,” the company said in a blog post.Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) unveiled its latest AI processors earlier this month at Computex. AMD CEO Lisa Su introduced the MI325X accelerator, which is set to be made available in the fourth quarter of 2024. AMD also introduced an upcoming series of chips titled MI350 – expected to be available in 2025 – are aimed at performing 35 times better in inference - the process of computing generative AI responses. AMD revealed the MI400 series, which will arrive in 2026.Intel has also introduced the first-generation Intel Gaudi AI deep learning processor. The company says that the architecture of the chip has been designed for deep learning performance and efficiency. It is also claimed to offer flexible system scaling.","Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Meta are all heavily reliant on Nvidia's H100 AI chips.

Deloitte AI exec dispels one of the biggest fears related to AI,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/deloitte-ai-exec-dispels-one-of-the-biggest-fear-related-to-ai/articleshow/111211823.cms,"Deloitte’s AI executive, Rohit Tandon , emphasizes that AI will create new roles while collaborating with humans. Contrary to the common narrative, Tandon asserts that the future belongs to AI-human collaboration , not replacement. He envisions a revolutionary era where technology empowers the workforce rather than displacing it. In an interview with PTI, Tandon, Managing Director and AI Insights Practice Leader at Deloitte LLP, dispels fears of job losses, emphasizing that AI won’t snatch jobs but will transform the employment landscape.Tandon highlights that AI won’t merely replace people; it will work alongside them. He draws parallels to past technological advancements, such as IT and computers, which initially sparked concerns about job displacement. However, Tandon points out that IT ultimately led to the creation of numerous jobs globally. Similarly, AI’s impact will be all-pervasive, with powerful algorithms accessible on personal devices.The fear of job losses isn’t new. Automation and call centers previously raised similar concerns. While AI will automate easier tasks, it will also create new opportunities. Tandon predicts that AI will replace certain roles with AI-human collaboration. As AI automates simpler jobs, humans will tackle more complex challenges.Tandon emphasizes that AI will supplement human knowledge and information retrieval. It will eliminate specific roles but ultimately generate more jobs. Sectors like finance, HR, and shared services are already impacted by AI. Additionally, energy, consumerization, banking, and hospitality sectors leverage AI’s capabilities.Regarding regulations, Tandon advocates for dynamic approaches. Rather than rigid point-in-time rules, continuous evaluation and adaptation are essential. Government collaboration is crucial for successful AI adoption. Tandon suggests two pillars: computing capability and grassroots-level training. Governments should facilitate compute resources while fostering AI education.In summary, Tandon’s vision underscores AI’s collaborative potential, emphasizing that it will enhance, not replace, the workforce. By fostering dynamic regulations and government-industry partnerships, we can accelerate AI adoption globally.","Rohit Tandon, Managing Director and AI Insights Practice Leader at Deloitte LLP, dispels fears of job losses.

The US government has banned the sale of Kaspersky antivirus software in the country citing security concerns. The ban will come into effect from next month.

As per sources, the sale of white-labeled products - that integrate Kaspersky into software sold under a different brand name - will also be barred.Imposing the ‘first of its kind’ ban, the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security said that the software poses national security and privacy risks due to the company's Russian origins.“Russia has shown it has the capacity, and even more than that, the intent to exploit Russian companies like Kaspersky to collect and weaponize the personal information of Americans. And that’s why we are compelled to take the action that we’re taking today,” U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said.Kaspersky will be banned from selling its softwares in the US to individual customers as well as businesses starting July 20.Raimondo said that consumers who are already using Kaspersky's antivirus are not violating the law.

Melinda stepped from Gates foundation after the divorce

Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates divorced his ex-wife Melinda French Gates in 2021. Years later, Melinda French Gates has opened up about her divorce. In an interview with Time Magazine recently, she described the end of 27-years marriage as ‘a painful and horrible experience’.“Getting a divorce is a horrible thing. It’s just painful. It’s awful when you realize you need one,” she said. Although later she corrected horrible to hard, but added that things are wonderful now that it’s over.During the interview, Melinda Gates also talked about how getting divorced in a pandemic helped the couple get privacy. “It gave us the privacy to do what needed to be done in private,"" she told Time.She also reflected on being able to navigate the process while taking care of children. “You know, I separated first before I made the full decision about a divorce. And to be able to do that in private while I’m still trying to take care of the kids, while still making certain decisions about how you’re going to disentangle your life - thank God,"" she said.The divorce led her to step away from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in May this year, three years after the divorce. During the interview, she told Time that she thought about the effect of divorce on the foundation.""I thought a lot about my three children. But I certainly thought about the effect on the foundation. Those are the three biggest buckets: me, the kids, and the foundation. And I wanted to make sure that when we came through it to the other side - all of those pieces were intact.”Melinda also explained that she does not see her decision to exit the foundation as ‘downsizing’. “I don’t see it honestly as a downsizing ...I was just ready to be able to have full decision-making control about where all the funds go,” she said.","Melinda French Gates divorced her husband Bill Gates in 2021.

What the Apple Store will offer

Apple is all set to launch its first store in Malaysia , Apple The Exchange TRX, located in Kuala Lumpur 's Tun Razak Exchange business district. The yet-to-open store features a unique glass dome-like design.“Emitting a warm glow at night, the three-dimensional layered roof consists of horizontal glass panels and shading blades to reduce the sun’s rays. A central glazed oculus brings daylight into the interior and includes a dynamic artificial-lighting feature,” said the company.Inside the store, a sculptural quartz and glass staircase connects the three levels where customers can explore, learn, and shop. The Forum, home to Today at Apple programming, is located on a floating deck that joins up with the mall, while the upper level directly connects with the edge of the park, bringing daylight and greenery into the store through a continuous glass façade.The store runs on 100 percent renewable energy and is designed using high-quality materials, including natural stone walls, polished stainless-steel columns, light terrazzo floors, and a timber ceiling.Apple has announced that the store will open for customers on Saturday (June 22). “To celebrate the opening, a special Today at Apple series, “Jom Discover,” will run from Saturday, June 22, through Saturday, July 6. Bringing together some of Malaysia’s most celebrated creators, the sessions will offer a glimpse into the creative process while showcasing Apple’s full range of products and services,” said the company in a release.The Malaysian Apple Store has more than 160 employees and the customers will be able to shop for their favourite Apple products — from the iPhone 15 lineup to the MacBook Air with M3 and the latest iPad models, including the redesigned iPad Air and incredibly thin iPad Pro with M4.","Apple is all set to launch its first store in Malaysia, Apple The Exchange TRX, located in Kuala Lumpur's Tun Razak Exchange business district.

Apple Intelligence launch in China may face these three ‘challenges’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-intelligence-launch-in-china-may-face-these-three-challenges/articleshow/111147927.cms,"Tough rules for AI models

Ban on ChatGPT, which will be integrated in Apple devices

Ban on OpenAI’s ChatGPT in China

Private Cloud Compute

Apple has announced Apple Intelligence , a suite of AI features that will run on iPhones, iPads and Mac PCs. The AI features will be available later this year to users globally, including China – one the most critical markets for the company. However, the company’s big AI push may face some challenges in China as regulators have in place strict rules around the technology amid tough competition.The three challenges that the company may face in China are (via CNBC):China’s AI market is tightly regulated and all companies launching AI models must have approval from the regulators for the commercial use of LLMs. The country has also made it mandatory for Generative AI providers to take down “illegal” content.Since some of the features of Apple Intelligence are developed by the company itself, Apple will likely need to get its AI model approved by authorities under Chinese rules.China has also banned OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Some of Apple’s voice assistant Siri’s capabilities are dependent on ChatGPT. This could mean that Apple may have to find a local AI company that provides the same level of capabilities as ChatGPT. Baidu and Alibaba are among China’s technology giants that have their own LLMs and voice assistants.Apple's AI launch highlighted a focus on user privacy. Their new system, Private Cloud Compute, processes user data on Apple-owned servers, with the company claiming the data itself is not stored.However, in China, Apple's iCloud data is stored on servers located locally and operated by a third party. This may raise concerns about whether Apple can maintain complete control over its AI computing servers in the country.This means that Apple must have a similar partnership for its AI servers in the region to keep user data private.","Apple has announced Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI features that will run on iPhones, iPads and Mac PCs.

During a town hall earlier this month, the global operations head of TCS ' resource management group (RMG) Amar Shetye revealed that the company currently has thousands of open positions that it is not able to fill due to the skills gap.Shetye put the number at 80,000. For those unaware, the RMG team at TCS is responsible for allocation of available resources to various projects across the company and in case of any shortfall, fill such requirements through contractors. These contractors are on the roles of the hiring agencies and may or may not be hired as permanent staff by the company.The reason for the skills gap is said to be a mismatch between the skills possessed by employees and the roles in demand.An employee who attended the townhall anonymously told TOI, ""We were told that either skillsets or employee aspirations are not matching project requirements. However, at TCS, no associate is forced to take on a project if they are not comfortable with it.""""He told us that we should consider ourselves fortunate that the firm is not laying off employees for not being mapped to any project unlike other firms,"" another employee on the bench added.The company’s recent annual report revealed that 33% of job requirements are currently being met by grooming existing talent.Post the announcement of fourth quarter results, TCS CEO K Krithivasan said that the company has built one of the largest artificial-intelligence-ready workforces in the world. ""TCS is currently working over 200 engagements in GenAI with our clients and foresees a promising pipeline of future work across all industries,"" he wrote.TCS posted strong performance in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 2024-25. ""This is a quarter of strong deals and execution for us. Continuous focus on operational excellence helped us achieve a 26% operating margin."" The management also said that deal wins were ""across markets, industries and geographies.""The Mumbai-headquartered company said that it had signed new deals totalling $13.2 billion in the fourth quarter, which is one of the highest ever for the company even as it signalled a cautious turnaround for the industry.

https://instaservices.hdfcbank.com/?journey=107&source_type=103

Starting June 25, HDFC Bank will stop sending text alerts for low-value UPI transactions. This means that HDFC Bank customers will receive SMS alerts for UPI transactions exceeding Rs 100 when sending money and similar notification for when received is above Rs 500. However, the bank will continue to send email alerts for all transactions with no absolutely change.In a mail as well as SMS alert sent to its customers, HDFC Bank said: “Starting from 25th June, 2024: Email Alerts: Continue to receive email alerts for all UPI transactions. SMS Notifications: Now only for transactions above Rs 100 (money sent/paid) and Rs 500 (money received).”This change aligns with banking norms, which require text messages for transactions over Rs 5,000. Despite this, many banks send alerts for lower-value debits as well. HDFC Bank stated that feedback indicated alerts for low-value transactions were deemed 'not useful,' as there is often duplication of notifications from UPI payment apps.Bankers noted that bulk text messages cost between Rs 0.01-0.03 each. With UPI transactions averaging around 40 crores per day, banks collectively spend several crores daily on text message alerts.Banks are also promoting the use of UPI Lite for transactions up to Rs 500. UPI Lite allows a small amount of money to be set aside by the app, facilitating quick payments without the need for second-factor authentication.By reducing the frequency of low-value transaction alerts, HDFC Bank and others aim to streamline notifications for customers while also cutting costs.
