ChatGPT's launch sparks renewed focus on AI

Despite being an early mover in the artificial intelligence space with the introduction of Siri in 2011, Apple has fallen behind its competitors in the AI arms race, according to a report by The Wall Street Journal. The company's characteristic secrecy, focus on seamless integration between hardware and software, and a series of internal hurdles have hindered its progress in the rapidly evolving field of AI.The Wall Street Journal revealed that Apple had made efforts to revamp Siri, with one project, code-named Blackbird, showcasing impressive capabilities such as improved speed, conversational abilities, and accuracy in understanding user commands. However, a more modest upgrade, known as Siri X , won out in an internal contest ahead of Siri's 10th anniversary, focusing on moving more existing Siri software onto iPhones from remote servers to enhance speed and privacy.In 2018, Apple hired Google 's AI chief, John Giannandrea , to centralise the company's fragmented AI efforts. However, cultural clashes between Giannandrea's team, largely composed of ex-Googlers and staff from Apple's startup acquisitions, and the rest of the company led to difficulties in collaboration. The Journal noted that while Apple emphasises strict deadlines, Giannandrea's team tended to operate more like parts of Google, with loosely defined timelines. This led to other parts of Apple, such as the software group run by Senior Vice President Craig Federighi , continuing to invest in and build their own AI capabilities separately.Former executives and engineers told The Wall Street Journal that the lack of access to sufficient computing resources, particularly graphical processing units (GPUs) essential for training AI models, further limited Apple's AI team. The team often had to rely on external cloud services, such as Google's cloud, to train their AI models.However, reports suggest that Apple will be using custom chips to offload cloud processing for AI chops. The word is that Apple was working on custom chips for the cloud, but eventually opted to use existing chips that it believed already had strong security and privacy features. The plan is to first use a set of M2 Ultra chips in both Apple's own and third-party data centres, with a future shift to the more advanced M4 chip.The launch of ChatGPT in late 2022 was a turning point for Apple. Craig Federighi, the company's software chief, became a convert after experimenting with AI-powered tools like GitHub's Copilot during his Christmas break. This led to a renewed focus on incorporating generative AI into Apple's products, with employees across Federighi's software engineering organisation tasked with developing new ways to integrate the technology and given resources to pursue these projects.Apple's renewed commitment to AI also saw the company cancel its long-standing electric car project in February, with some employees redeployed to generative AI initiatives. The company has also been in talks with major AI developers like OpenAI, Google, and Cohere for potential partnerships.Bloomberg reports that Apple has signed a deal with OpenAI, and the official announcement is expected to be made next week during the WWDC keynote. However, a talk with Google is still going on.At the upcoming Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), Apple is expected to announce a range of generative AI upgrades to its software products, including Siri – much of it is expected to be powered by the company’s in-house language model.Dag Kittlaus, co-founder of the Siri startup that Apple acquired, told The Wall Street Journal, ""Siri has been stuck in the mud for years, but I absolutely see a renaissance coming.""There have been rumours of a smarter Siri being showcased at the developers' conference next week. This new version would be much chattier and more natural than before, and Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman says it might also allow people to control apps with their voice. However, this smarter Siri might not be available until next year.Rumours and reports have been pitching iOS 18 to be the biggest update yet, and the upcoming years to be a dusk of a new era for Apple, the era of Apple Intelligence. The hopes are high, but it'll be only later today that we'll know if Apple can deliver on it.","Cultural clashes and limited resources hamper AI efforts. ChatGPT's launch sparks renewed focus on AI.

"Google shuts down GPay app in this country, shift focus to wallet",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-shuts-down-gpay-app-in-us-shift-focus-to-wallet/articleshow/110858352.cms,"Impact on users

Likely reason for GPay shutdown

Google has announced the closure of its standalone GPay app for US users. Effective June 4, 2024, the GPay app will no longer be available on the Google Play Store or function on existing devices. This decision comes alongside the discontinuation of peer-to-peer (P2P) payments functionality within the region.Google emphasises a shift in strategy, aiming to consolidate mobile payment services within the Google Wallet app. Users will now manage payment methods, tap to pay at stores, and pay online directly through Google Wallet.Existing payment methods linked to GPay will automatically transfer to Google Wallet, ensuring a smooth user experience. However, P2P payments, a popular feature for splitting bills or sending money to friends, will no longer be available in the US.Google hasn't explicitly stated the reasons behind shutting down the GPay app. However, some speculate it could be a streamlining effort to simplify user experience and potentially reduce development costs. Additionally, Google Wallet may offer better integration with other Google services, providing a more unified platform.Google is discontinuing the GPay app in the United States, but versions in other markets like India and Singapore will continue to work. For the millions of people who use the Google Pay app in India and Singapore, nothing will change as we continue to build for the unique needs in those countries,” Google said in the blog.","GPay will no longer be available on the Google Play Store or function on existing devices.

6 leadership lessons from Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella to fuel success,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/6-leadership-lessons-from-microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-to-fuel-success/articleshow/110847416.cms,"Follow a well-written plan

Motivate employees

Deliver results even with limitations

Be a good listner

Provide psychological safety

Empathy is a key

Satya Nadella , who became Microsoft ’s CEO in 2014, will complete 10 years at the top post this year. Under his leadership, the company has seen an upward spiral in terms of business growth, partnerships and even taking a headstart in the AI-first era .Recently, Microsoft leapfrogged Apple to become the world's most valuable public company and the company is now gearing up to launch Copilot+ PCs to take on Apple. But what makes Nadella a strong leader and what is his approach to success? Here are six quotes from his several interviews from over the last 10 years (via Business Insider).Nadella has been a supporter of creating clarity even “when none exists"" and says that this is the ""most important attribute that any leader needs to have.""""You don't need a leader when everything is well-defined, and it's easy, and all you have got to do is follow a well-written plan. But in an ambiguous situation, where there cannot be complete information, that is when leadership will matter. Your ability to come into an uncertain time and an uncertain future and bring about clarity is key,” he said in an interview with Chicago Booth Magazine in 2019.Nadella seeks passionate and inspiring leaders who can motivate and excite their teams.""There is no simple thing that is always under your control, so the idea that you have got to create energy all around you is another element—you have got to really pick up the skills to do it. You have got to be at your evangelical best. You have got to have followership all around you,” he told the magazine.In 2014, he said the same thing. “In the long run EQ trumps IQ. Without being a source of energy for others very little can be accomplished.”Nadella emphasises the importance of achieving success even with limitations.“Life is an overconstraint problem. So you can't say, 'You know what? I'm just waiting for you to remove all the constraints and I'll be perfect.' When leaders come in and say, 'I'm not able to do this or I'm not able to drive success or achieve success because of all these exogenous factors,' guess what? Everything is exogenous,” he said.Nadella advocates for active listening and clear decision-making in meetings. ""Listen more, talk less, and be decisive when the time comes,"" he told The Wall Street Journal in an interview in 2015.Nadella prioritises creating a work environment where employees feel safe to take risks, ask questions, and admit mistakes.“The psychological safety that you create around you, especially the more senior you are, becomes super important. One technique of that is to share your own fallibility because that gives confidence to others,” he said in an interview at the 2022 Wharton Future of Work Conference.Nadella views empathy as a crucial leadership skill, even calling it the “hardest skill we learn” in a 2023 interview with Axel Springer CEO Mathias Döpfner.“If you have empathy for your people, they will do their best work and you'll make progress. Innovation is about meeting the unmet unarticulated needs of customers. What's the source of it? You could say it's design thinking, but design thinking is empathy,” Nadella said in a 2020 episode of LinkedIn's “Hello Monday” podcast.","Satya Nadella, Microsoft's CEO, will complete 10 years at the top post this year.

BSNL wants telecom ministry to pay Rs 99 crore reimbursement due to this 'delay' from TCS,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/bsnl-wants-telecom-ministry-to-pay-rs-99-crore-reimbursement-due-to-this-delay-from-tcs/articleshow/110853639.cms,"What BSNL letter says on 'delay' from TCS

State-run Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) has reportedly sought reimbursement of Rs 99 crore from the government. According to a report in Economic Times, quoting a letter dated June 3, 2024, addressed to the Administrator, USOF, Department of Telecommunications (DoT), the state-run BSNL has requested reimbursement of Rs 99 crore from the government.This request arises from the additional operations and maintenance (O&M) cost that BSNL is likely to incur due to delays in the delivery and commissioning of Evolved Node B ( eNB ) equipment by the supplier consortium led by Tata Consultancy Services ( TCS ).The consortium also includes Centre for Development of Telematics (C-DoT) and Tejas Networks, providing core and radio equipment respectively for the project.According to the letter by BSNL's GM (NWP-SP), Reena Malhotra, there's a delay in installation and commissioning of core equipment in four zones by TCS, which could persist for an average of six months. This has resulted in a postponement of commissioning sites under the 4G saturation project .BSNL argues that it's proceeding with tower and passive infrastructure installation, enabling TCS to swiftly deploy eNBs upon equipment receipt.Malhotra has urged DoT to consider this an ""exceptional case"" and compensate BSNL for the additional O&M cost at approximately Rs 55,000 per site for two quarters across roughly 9,000 impacted sites.This request for Rs 99 crore reimbursement comes in the backdrop of the Centre approving a Rs 26,316 crore project in July 2022 to saturate 4G mobile services in uncovered villages across the country.The project targets providing 4G connectivity in 24,680 uncovered villages in remote and difficult areas with the flexibility to include an additional 20% for various contingencies. Additionally, 6,279 villages with only 2G or 3G services will be upgraded to 4G.

During a press conference following a policy meeting, Governor Das emphasized that the NPCI ’s infrastructure is not at fault for the downtime. Instead, the problems arise from the banks’ end, including their networking links, which are being addressed.Digital payment failures are on the rise, causing financial distress for banking customers. Notably, on June 4th, many investors were unable to execute transactions during a market downturn, leading to missed financial opportunities.UPI transactions exceed 450 million daily, and in May 2024, banks experienced 31 instances of downtime, resulting in payment gateways being offline for over 47 hours, as per NPCI data.Regulated entities must report all system outages, whether scheduled or unexpected. The RBI has been striving to minimize these incidents, which have now been reduced to below 1%.To alleviate the strain on banks’ systems, the RBI has introduced UPI Lite, which handles 10 million transactions monthly, as part of its ongoing efforts to enhance digital payment reliability.","UPI transactions exceed 450 million daily, and in May 2024, banks experienced 31 instances of downtime, resulting in payment gateways being offline for over 47 hours.

What company leaders have to say

Companies that are looking to cybersecurity professionals are facing a new challenge: hackers using artificial intelligence (AI) to disguise themselves as qualified applicants – making it difficult for employers to differentiate between legitimate job seekers and bad actors, a report has said.According to a report by The Wall Street Journal, as cyberattacks on businesses rise, security leaders in the US are tightening hiring procedures to identify bad actors or those exaggerating their skills.Spies who are hired may steal intellectual property and corporate data. US officials have previously warned of a large, hidden workforce of North Korean IT workers in low-level jobs globally.The report says that these workers help North Korea evade sanctions and generate billions through cybercrime, often aided by Westerners posing as job applicants .The Justice Department recently alleged that over 300 US companies unknowingly hired foreign nationals with North Korean ties for remote IT jobs.Lili Infante, CEO of CAT Labs, a cryptocurrency recovery startup, shared at a cybersecurity conference that North Korean hackers frequently apply for jobs at her company, some even referred by recruiters.“We've identified over 50 applicants as potential North Korean spies forcing us to implement stricter hiring controls ,” Infante was quoted as saying.Infante explained that in cryptocurrency firms, these hackers can introduce vulnerabilities to steal assets.However, cyber hiring teams aren't just looking for state-sponsored actors, applicants with inflated resumes are also a concern.AI tools like ChatGPT makes spotting imposters harder as they can generate perfect resumes and cover letter answers. Additionally, AI-created deepfakes allow impersonation attacks through mimicked voices and videos, leading to cyber breaches .“I always request ID verification on video. With deepfakes and remote work, it's easy to accidentally hire a North Korean spy if not careful,” Infante said.Brent Conran, Intel's CISO, says that he personally interviews senior-level cybersecurity hires and uses “technical gates” to assess skills – a test Conran himself had to pass.","Hackers using artificial intelligence (AI) to disguise themselves as qualified applicants.

The next-generation iPhones, likely to be called the iPhone 16 series, are expected to launch later this year in September with new features, changes and improvements. Leaks and rumours have already revealed some key changes that the iPhone 16 series will come packed with.The most notable change that we expect to see is in the top-of-the-line iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max models. This includes a bigger display, an improved camera and more. Here’s our speculation on how the two Pro models will differ.This one is a bit obvious. The iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max always had the screen size difference. This time around, however, the screen sizes are changing too. The iPhone 16 Pro is expected to feature a 6.3-inch display instead of 6.1-inch. And, the iPhone 16 Pro Max is rumoured to come with a 6.9-inch display which will make the iPhone 16 Pro Max to offer the biggest display ever on an iPhone.Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max with a slightly bigger display, is expected to come with a slightly taller design. However, the overall thickness of the phone is expected to remain unchanged. Also, the iPhone 16 Pro will be lighter compared to the iPhone 16 Pro Max.Apple is also expected to make certain changes to the camera setup of both iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max. Both the Pro models are expected to feature the updated 48MP ultra-wide sensor along with the 48MP main sensor. Additionally, Apple will update the telephoto lens from 3x to 5x (same as iPhone 16 Pro Max) on the iPhone 16 Pro models.The camera setup is expected to offer better low-light performance, dynamic range and several other improvements in terms of image quality.Apple iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max is also expected to come with improved battery capacity. This means, the two models could offer better battery life compared to the iPhone 15 Pro models. However, the iPhone 16 Pro is expected to come with smaller battery compared to iPhone 16 Pro Max.","The next-generation iPhones are expected to launch later this year in September.

How Apple is trying to regain its position in China



Apple has achieved a new milestone in iPhone sales. As per data from Stocklytics.com (seen by Patently Apple), the Cupertino-based tech giant has about to reach the $2 trillion mark in iPhone's lifetime sales. This achievement comes after a recent decline in market share due to competition from Chinese brands like Xiaomi and Huawei.Since its introduction in 2007, this has been Apple’s most successful product as the company keeps updating its smartphones with new models and features.As per Statista data, Apple grossed $78.7 billion from iPhone sales within five years after releasing the first mode. Two years later, in FY 2014, this figure jumped to $101.9 billion and continued rising.The tech giant experienced several challenging years, especially in 2019 and 2020 when consumers worldwide reduced their spending budgets amid the pandemic. The report alsoclaims that iPhone sales have doubled and hit record highs in 2022 and 2023.During those two years, Apple grossed over $405 billion from selling iPhones, the highest figures in its history. Despite the revenue figures dropping slightly in the second quarter of FY 2024, iPhone sales remain strong. Statistics show Apple grossed $115.6 billion from iPhone sales in H1 FY 2024, pushing its lifetime revenue to a whopping $1.95 trillion.In Q1 FY 2009, Apple’s iPhone sales also accounted for about a quarter of Apple’s total revenue. Since then, this figure has more than doubled and hit 50.64% in Q1 2024.China is one of the biggest iPhone markets for Apple. According to a report by Counterpoint, Apple’s iPhone sales declined by more than 19% as Huawei saw 70% year-on-year growth in its smartphone sales in the country.To increase iPhone sales in China, Apple reportedly launched an aggressive discounting campaign on its official Tmall website in China in May. With these discounts, the company aims to fight off growing competition from local brands like Huawei. The latest discounts were steeper than those offered earlier this year.","Apple grossed $115.6 billion from iPhone sales in H1 FY 2024, pushing its lifetime revenue to a whopping $1.95 trillion.

While staying comfortable during hot weather is essential, it doesn't have to come at the cost of soaring electricity bills. By implementing strategic energy-saving practices, you can reduce your summer electricity expenses without sacrificing comfort.Here you can explore several effective ways to save on summer electricity bills, offering practical tips and strategies that can help you minimise energy consumption and lower your utility costs during the warmer months.

The label uses stars to indicate the efficiency of a product, with more stars indicating higher efficiency. Simply put, the higher the energy efficiency rating of the appliance, the lower its energy consumption. To effectively reduce your home's energy costs, opt for appliances with a 5-star BEE rating. Not only does this positively impact the environment, but it also helps lower your electricity bills. Explore Crompton's wide range of 5-star rated ceiling fans to learn more about BEE Rating Appliances.If your home still uses CFLs and incandescent bulbs, it's time to replace them with LED bulbs.
