Hackers adopting this ‘aggressive new tactic’ to force victims into paying for stolen data,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/hackers-adopting-this-aggressive-new-tactic-to-force-victims-into-paying-for-stolen-data/articleshow/112432466.cms,"What data are hackers using against companies, individuals

Ransomware gangs are employing increasingly aggressive tactics to extort victims, according to a new report. It says that hackers are now weaponizing stolen data , targeting not just organisations but also individuals associated with them.“In December 2023, in the wake of the MGM casino breach, Sophos began taking note of ransomware gangs’ propensity to turn the media into a tool they can use to not only increase pressure on their victims but take control of the narrative and shift the blame.We are also seeing gangs singling out the business leaders they deem ‘responsible’ for the ransomware attack at the companies they target,” said Christopher Budd, director of threat research at cybersecurity company Sophos.As per a report, these ransomware groups are leveraging stolen information to publicly humiliate victims, threaten to expose illegal activities to authorities, and even encourage employees to sue their employers. In some cases, the cybercriminals have gone as far as doxing the family members of targeted executives.“In one post we found, the attackers published a photo of a business owner with devil horns, along with their social security number. In a different post, the attackers encouraged employees to seek ‘compensation’ from their company, and, in other cases, the attackers threatened to notify customers, partners and competitors about data breaches. These efforts create a lightning rod for blame, increasing the pressure on businesses to pay up and potentially exacerbating the reputational damage from an attack,” Budd added.Sophos found several posts which suggest that criminals are seeking to extort companies with increasingly sensitive data relating to employees, clients or patients. This includes mental health records, the medical records of children, “information about patients’ sexual problems” and “images of nude patients”.Sophos warns that these tactics create significant pressure on organisations to pay ransoms, potentially leading to a surge in cyberattacks.","Ransomware gangs are employing increasingly aggressive tactics to extort victims, according to a new report.

Google vs US: How court ruling may change two of the company's biggest businesses,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-vs-us-how-court-ruling-may-change-two-of-the-companys-biggest-businesses/articleshow/112432452.cms,"Government scrutiny may hinder Google's AI Search ambitions

Google’s Android OS may be affected

Google recently lost the antitrust case against the US Department of Justice (DJ) for illegally monopolising the search engine and search advertising markets. While Google can still contest the ruling, the outcome of the antitrust case may have far-reaching implications for the tech giant.In the case, the DoJ alleged that Google has abused its dominant position to stifle competition and harm consumers.Key accusations include exclusive billion-dollar deals with companies like Apple to make its search engine the default on iPhones and other devices.A report has said that after winning the case against Google, the justice department won't just seek to diminish the company's deal with Apple. According to The Information, the government lawyers may hamper Google’s next version of search, AI-powered Search with conversational capabilities.“In the next phase of the case, which involves meting out punishments for Google's illegal monopoly, government lawyers are also likely to try to hamper the company's effort to dominate the next version of search-conversational artificial intelligence-and make it easier for rival search providers to eat into its 95% share of the market, according to lawyers who have been following the case,” the report said.Another of Google’s large businesses is Android, which is present on 2.5 billion devices, may also be affected.The DoJ is also expected to push for significant structural changes to Google, rather than simply imposing behavioural restrictions. One potential remedy being considered is the forced divestment of Android, which the judge deemed instrumental in perpetuating Google's dominance, as per Gene Burrus, a former assistant general counsel at Microsoft.","Google recently lost the antitrust case against the US Department of Justice (DJ) for illegally monopolising the search engine and search advertising markets.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai’s memo on former YouTube chief Susan Wojcicki death: “I’ll never forget her kindness to me…”,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-ceo-sundar-pichais-memo-on-former-youtube-chief-susan-wojcicki-death-ill-never-forget-her-kindness-to-me/articleshow/112432425.cms,"Here is the full memo Pichai sent to Google employees:

Googlers,

By now you may have heard the news that Susan Wojcicki has passed away after two years of living with lung cancer. Even as I write this it feels impossible to me that it’s true. Susan was one of the most active and vibrant people I have ever met. Her loss is devastating for all of us who know and love her, for the thousands of Googlers she led over the years, and for millions of people all over the world who looked up to her, benefited from her advocacy and leadership, and felt the impact of the incredible things she created at Google, YouTube, and beyond.

Susan’s journey, from the garage she rented to Larry and Sergey … to leading teams across consumer products and building our Ads business … to becoming the CEO of YouTube, one of the world’s most significant platforms, is inspiring by any measure. But she didn’t stop there. As one of the earliest Googlers — and the first to take maternity leave — Susan used her position to build a better workplace for everyone. And in the years that followed, her advocacy around parental leave set a new standard for businesses everywhere. Susan was also deeply passionate about education. She realized early on that YouTube could be a learning platform for the world and championed “edutubers” — especially those who extended the reach of STEM education to underserved communities.

Over the last two years, even as she dealt with great personal difficulties, Susan devoted herself to making the world better through her philanthropy, including supporting research for the disease that ultimately took her life. I know that was very meaningful to her and I’m so glad she took the time to do it.

Susan always put others first, both in her values and in the day to day. I’ll never forget her kindness to me as a prospective “Noogler” 20 years ago. During my Google interview she took me out for an ice cream and a walk around campus. I was sold – on Google and Susan.

I feel so fortunate to have spent so many years working with Susan closely, as I’m sure many of you do — she was absolutely loved by her teams here. Her time on earth was far too short, but she made every minute count.

We’re in close touch with Susan’s family, including her husband and fellow Googler, Dennis. We will share more soon about how we’re going to celebrate her incredible life. In the meantime, let’s honor Susan’s memory by continuing to build a Google she would be proud of.

Susan Wojcicki , former CEO of YouTube and a prominent figure in the tech industry, has passed away at the age of 56. Her husband, Dennis Troper, announced the news on social media, sharing that she had been battling lung cancer for two years. Google CEO Sundar Pichai and YouTube chief executive Neal Mohan also extended their condolences via posts on X.After her death, Pichai shared a memo to Google employees highlighting Wojcicki’s instrumental role in the company’s growth. Pichai recalled how she was kind to him and took Pichai for an ice cream during his interview for the company. Pichai also noted that the company will soon share about how it is “going to celebrate her incredible life.”","Susan Wojcicki, former CEO of YouTube, has passed away at the age of 56.

Bill Gates

and his Quest to Shape the World’

A ""low hum of fear"" among staff

Former employees of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation have described a stressful internal culture marked by deference to the founders and fear of making mistakes, according to a new bookThe foundation's annual strategy review meetings were a source of particular anxiety, with employees frantically preparing presentations and scrutinising Bill Gates' every reaction.""It seemed that many employees were motivated more by Gates's praise — sometimes, even the absence of opprobrium was seen as validation — than by the success of their grant-making,"" one former attendee told the author Anupreeta Das .Several ex-employees characterised the atmosphere as deferential, with staff tiptoeing around Gates and eager to do his bidding. ""There was no handbook for how to deal with the foundation's co-founders, especially with Gates,"" Das writes.Gates' management style was described as imperious and intimidating by some. ""He's the scariest person in the world to provide a recommendation or briefing to,"" said one former foundation employee, noting Gates' ability to spot minor discrepancies in documents.The organisational culture led to what Das called a ""low hum of fear"" among staff. If Gates sent an email requesting something, it could spark a flurry of up to 100 internal messages as employees tried to decipher his meaning and determine how to respond.Some former executives found Gates' approach frustrating, particularly those hired for their expertise. ""It's like using the Socratic method . . . with an autocrat,"" one ex-employee said of Gates' questioning style in meetings.While some employees adapted to the high-pressure environment, others struggled. Das reports that people at the foundation generally fell into three categories: loyal ""consiglieres,"" young aspirants in awe of Gates, and sceptics who found him domineering and eventually left. Gates Foundation spokesperson disputed the book's characterizations, calling them ""highly sensationalised allegations and outright falsehoods that ignore the actual documented facts.""","Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation described as 'deferential' and'scariest person in the world to provide a recommendation or briefing to' Author Anupreeta Das says there was 'no handbook for how to deal with the foundation's co-founders, especially with Gates' Gates Foundation spokesperson calls claims'sensationalised allegations and outright falsehoods'","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112431847,imgsize-1007342,width-400,resizemode-4/112431847.jpg"

“Globalstar is keen on establishing a wholly owned subsidiary in India for which we propose to apply for a GMPCS authorisation. Under such authorisation, we will establish a land earth station gateway(s). We expect that no new or onerous requirements will be imposed upon GMPCS authorised entity, as a result of introducing a new satellite earth station gateway license, as mentioned above.”

“India represents the single largest market that Globalstar has been previously unable to enter,”

“owns and operates a Low Earth Orbit (""LEO"") satellite system providing near-global coverage, including India.”

What is a GMPCS permit



Apple’s satellite communication services provider Globalstar is planning to enter the Indian satcom market. The company’s mobile satellite services (MSS) network powers “a direct-to-handset emergency SOS via satellite feature” on iPhone 14 and 15 models which was introduced in 2022. Apple has since expanded this service to more regions outside the US.With Globalstar’s entry into the country, the iPhone maker may even offer its satellite services to users in India.This feature can help users send and receive messages via satellite in situations when there is no terrestrial or Wi-Fi connectivity. Currently, Apple’s SOS via satellite feature is available only for some regions.In a consultation paper submitted to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI), Globalstar, the company proposed a GMPCS (Global Mobile Personal Communications via Satellite Services) authorisation from the telecom regulator to operate in India. This is the first time that Globalstar has outlined its India entry plans.The company wrote:the company noted.Globalstar added that itTo launch commercial broadband-from-space services in India, satellite companies need a GMPCS permit from the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) and approval from the Indian space regulator, IN-SPACe .Currently, only Bharti Group-backed Eutelsat OneWeb and Orbit Connect India (a joint venture between Jio Platforms and SES) have these permits.

Read Intel’s 'biggest statement' so far on how it plans to address its CPU troubles,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/read-intels-biggest-statement-so-far-on-how-it-plans-to-address-its-cpu-troubles/articleshow/112432928.cms,"Here’s the statement issued by Intel (as it appears on Intel community):

Intel is currently distributing to its OEM/ODM partners a new microcode patch (0x129) for its Intel Core 13th/14th Gen desktop processors which will address incorrect voltage requests to the processor that are causing elevated operating voltage.

For all Intel Core 13th/14th Gen desktop processor users: This patch is being distributed via BIOS update and will not be available through operating system updates. Intel is working with its partners to ensure timely validation and rollout of the BIOS update for systems currently in service.

Instability Analysis Update – Microcode Background and Performance Implications

In addition to extended warranty coverage, Intel has released three mitigations related to the instability issue – commonly experienced as consistent application crashes and repeated hangs – to help stabilize customer systems with Intel Core 13th and 14th gen desktop processors:

1. Intel default settings to avoid elevated power delivery impact to the processor (May 2024)

2. Microcode 0x125 to fix the eTVB issue in i9 processors (June 2024)

3. Microcode 0x129 to address elevated voltages (August 2024)

Intel’s current analysis finds there is a significant increase to the minimum operating voltage (Vmin) across multiple cores on affected processors due to elevated voltages. Elevated voltage events can accumulate over time and contribute to the increase in Vmin for the processor.

The latest microcode update (0x129) will limit voltage requests above 1.55V as a preventative mitigation for processors not experiencing instability symptoms. This latest microcode update will primarily improve operating conditions for K/KF/KS processors. Intel is also confirming, based on extensive validation, all future products will not be affected by this issue.

Intel is continuing to investigate mitigations for scenarios that can result in Vmin shift on potentially impacted Intel Core 13th and 14th Gen desktop processors. Intel will provide updates by end of August.

Intel’s internal testing – utilizing Intel Default Settings - indicates performance impact is within run-to-run variation (eg. 3DMark: Timespy, WebXPRT 4, Cinebench R24, Blender 4.2.0) with a few sub-tests showing moderate impacts (WebXPRT Online Homework; PugetBench GPU Effects Score). For gaming workloads tested, performance has also been within run-to-run variation (eg. Cyberpunk 2077, Shadow of the Tomb Raider, Total War: Warhammer III – Mirrors of Madness) with one exception showing slightly more impact (Hitman 3: Dartmoor). However, system performance is dependent on configuration and several other factors.

For unlocked Intel Core 13th and 14th Gen desktop processors, this latest microcode update (0x129) will not prevent users from overclocking if they so choose. Users can disable the eTVB setting in their BIOS if they wish to push above the 1.55V threshold. As always, Intel recommends users proceed with caution when overclocking their desktop processors, as overclocking may void their warranty and/or affect system health. As a general best practice, Intel recommends customers with Intel Core 13th and 14th Gen desktop processors utilize the Intel Default Settings.

In light of the recently announced extended warranty program, Intel is reaffirming its confidence in its products and is committed to making sure all customers who have or are currently experiencing instability symptoms on their 13th and/or 14th Gen desktop processors are supported in the exchange process. Users experiencing consistent instability symptoms should reach out to their system manufacturer (OEM/System Integrator purchase), Intel Customer Support (boxed processor), or place of purchase (tray processor) further assistance.

For the first time, Intel has detailed its new patch to deal with instability issues in its 13th and 14th Gen CPUs. The chip giant has released a microcode patch to address the problem, which was causing processors to demand excessive power, leading to potential long-term damage. The new patch imposes a strict 1.55V voltage cap to prevent further damage.Intel is also investigating a related issue involving minimum voltage shifts and plans to provide an update by the end of the month. Notably, the company has assured users that future processors will be immune to this problem.To mitigate customer concerns, Intel has extended warranty coverage for affected 13th and 14th generation Core processors , including Core i5, i7 and i9 processors. The patch is being distributed through BIOS updates by PC manufacturers.",Intel has released a microcode patch to address instability issues in its 13th and 14th Gen CPUs.

"Raj Kumar Rishi, VP and MD, Dell India (CSB): Customers play an active role throughout our product development process",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/raj-kumar-rishi-vp-and-md-dell-india-csb-customers-play-an-active-role-throughout-our-product-development-process/articleshow/112432867.cms,"Can you elaborate on how the new Copilot+ AI features in the XPS 13 and Inspiron 14 Plus are designed to broaden the user base for these devices? How do these features make the laptops more approachable for non-technical users?

Dell is known for innovation, but how do you balance the need for cutting-edge features with incorporating user feedback into your product development process?

Copilot+ is a great example of AI integration, but are there other examples of how Dell leverages AI to enhance the user experience with the XPS and Inspiron lines?

How do you see customers embracing AI PCs? Is there a worry about how the high price point is a detrimental factor?

What kind of impact do you see AI-powered devices having on the overall PC market?

Raj Kumar Rishi is the Vice President and Managing Director for Dell Technologies’ India Consumer & Small Business (CSB) segment. In his current position he is responsible for driving the CSB strategy for India, that continues to be a top priority market for the company. With nearly three decades of experience in IT and consumer electronics, Rishi brings a wealth of knowledge to his role.His career has spanned both India and the Asia Pacific region, with leadership positions at industry giants like HP and Samsung. Most recently, he served as Managing Director of Xerox India. Rishi graduated from Delhi College of Engineering. Outside of work, he enjoys the outdoors and maintains an active lifestyle through yoga, swimming, and cycling. In an interaction with Times of India, Rishi spoke about company's new lineup of AI laptops, price barrier of AI PCs , importance of customer feedback in product development and more. Excerpts.With Copilot+ on both the XPS 13 9345 and Inspiron 14 Plus, users do not have to worry about an internet connection or the cloud, making tasks more seamless, accessible, and secure wherever they use their PC, be it for work or creation.Dell XPS 13 9345 is the first XPS to feature Copilot+. Likewise, the Inspiron 14 debuts the same on the Inspiron lineup, offering on-device AI and smartphone-like ease of use.Powered by Snapdragon X Series CPUs – the Snapdragon X Elite and Snapdragon X Plus, these PCs offer AI experience with high performance, extended battery life, and next-generation AI capabilities, including the ability to run Copilot+ locally. With this, Dell aims to redefine the user experience, demystifying complex tasks, and ensure that it works best for users of all technical proficiencies.At Dell Technologies, we are obsessed with providing the best-in-class experience for customers. They play an active role throughout our product development process, as we conduct extensive research, study feedback, patterns and trends through various channels, and incorporate them all into our product development process.This is executed in various ways. One key approach is focus group discussions to understand different types of consumers, such as students, gamers, and creators. This helps us learn what they are looking for, providing us with direct consumer feedback. Additionally, we rigorously analyse all comments and feedback received through Dell.com and our social listening channels weekly. This helps us understand how customers are engaging with us and identify areas for improvement.AI plays a pivotal role in enhancing both the intelligence and functionality of PCs, thereby enriching the user experience. A significant breakthrough lies in the advent of the Neural Processing Units (NPUs). The new XPS 13 9345 and Inspiron 14 Plus feature the Qualcomm Hexagon NPU, dedicated for on-device AI tasks. This significantly improves power efficiency and battery life, as well as lower heat and fan noise. On-device AI further enables greater security for the PC.At present, customers are increasingly adopting AI PCs for their ability to deliver enhanced performance, efficiency, and overall user experience. At Dell, we recognize that such integration of AI in personal computing is significant to meet the evolving needs of tech-savvy customers.While premiumization is a factor, the opportunity cost is simply too high for customers to wait too long. Therefore, by embracing AI PCs, consumers can begin realizing the benefits of AI today. Additionally, we have always been committed to providing a range of offers and financing schemes to make our PCs accessible to a broader audience. Thus, as AI continues to demonstrate its transformative potential, we anticipate that customers will see the value and adopt AI PCs as a vital component of their digital toolkit.Despite being in the early stages, the benefits of AI are significantly evident, and we are already witnessing these advantages today, making investing in AI PCs synonymous with investing in the future. With Dell’s lineup for instance, the NPU helps improve the audio-visual capabilities with Microsoft Studio Effects and allows faster photo editing for content creators and creative designers in the XPS lineup. Likewise, similar to how smartphones have become synonymous with mobile phones, having AI on PCs is certainly revolutionizing the entire experience. In the same manner, everyone will eventually want a PC that’s AI-enabled as it allows them to take advantage of its benefits. They will be part of an ecosystem of AI PCs, and those without them will perform differently, unable to fully leverage the capabilities of AI.As we progress further, a lot more use cases are bound to emerge and at Dell, we foresee AI integration leading to more intuitive and responsive devices that adapt to user needs in real-time.","Raj Kumar Rishi is the Vice President and Managing Director for Dell Technologies’ India Consumer & Small Business (CSB) segment.

Amazon Great Freedom Festival sale is here and as shoppers flock to the e-commerce platform for shopping, scammers are also gearing up to capitalise on the increased online activity. One common tactic employed by fraudsters is the OTP scam. Numerous individuals have fallen victim to this scheme in the past, prompting Amazon to issue warnings to its customers.Since people usually spend thousands of their hard-earned money, it becomes crucial to remain vigilant and protect personal information during this sale period, especially from scammers requesting sign-in OTP via phone calls.In a communication shared with customers recently, Amazon said that scammers are adopting multiple tactics to defraud unsuspecting shoppers. A growing number of individuals have reported receiving phone calls from individuals posing as Amazon customer service representatives or delivery agents. These scammers aim to steal personal information, including login credentials, by manipulating victims into revealing sensitive data.Scammers often try to create a sense of urgency, stating that there has been an unexpected order or delivery which may not have been placed by a potential victim. The scammers will then ask for a sign-in One-Time Password (OTP) to cancel the delivery.A confused ‘customer’ then shares the OTP thinking that he/ she has averted the hassle of package delivery, however in reality, the scammer has gained access to the account. Shoppers must note that Amazon will never ask its customers to share their account sign-in OTP or passcode, especially over the phone to avoid being scammed.“If you receive communication — a call, text, or email — that you think may not be from Amazon, please report it to us at, amazon.in/reportascam,” it said.Last year, Amazon India and the Uttar Pradesh Police joined hands to fight fraud and protect online shoppers from bad actors. They launched a consumer education and awareness campaign named #MissionGraHAQ.","Amazon Great Freedom Festival sale is here and as shoppers flock to the e-commerce platform for shopping, scammers are gearing up to capitalise on the increased online activity.

"Reliance Jio, Airtel and Vodafone-Idea 'unhappy' with Trai's new QoS rules; say overlook ground realities",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/reliance-jio-airtel-and-vodafone-idea-unhappy-with-trais-new-qos-rules-say-overlook-ground-realities/articleshow/112268723.cms,"COAI statement

COAI’s member Telecom Service Providers (TSPs) have consistently invested in enhancing Quality of Service (QoS) through significant improvements in network infrastructure, resulting in greater stability and reliability. The industry has embraced advanced technologies and automation tools, including predictive maintenance and AI-driven analytics, to proactively address network issues. Moreover, major initiatives are underway to fiberize towers across India, which is a crucial step for the efficient deployment of 5G services.

While TRAI has tightened the QoS benchmarks over the years, the ground realities remain unchanged. TSPs still grapple with Right of Way (RoW) issues when acquiring permissions for infrastructure deployment in public and private land for the installation of cell towers and fiber-optic cables. The situation is further aggravated due to additional requirement of street furniture for the 5G networks. Moreover, interference from various sources, such as other wireless devices and electromagnetic interference, degrade signal quality and network performance. Further, illegal boosters and repeaters used by unauthorised agents, as well as the cases of theft of equipment are also external factors which, nevertheless, impact the QoS. Besides, frequent takedown of the overhead fiber by the authorities have a significant impact in QoS as well. TSPs have limited control over these external sources which adversely impact the Quality of Services.

Despite these challenges, TSPs have consistently met TRAI's QoS benchmarks. The industry expresses concern over the proposed regulations, which not only tighten benchmarks but also shift from quarterly to monthly reporting and site to cell level reporting in many cases. In fact, the QoS parameters prescribed in the new Regulations have not been introduced by any other regulator in other similar economies. These changes are expected to significantly increase the compliance as well as the cost burden on telecom operators, and without commensurate benefits for the customers.

While we are disappointed with the stringency of these new regulations, we remain committed to engaging constructively with TRAI on QoS-related matters. Our member organizations will continue to strive for excellence in service quality while advocating for regulations that recognize the practical challenges faced by our industry.

What are the new QoS rules

The telecom industry has raised concerns over stringent new quality of service (QoS) norms introduced by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India ( TRAI ). The Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), representing major telecom players -- Reliance Jio , Airtel and Vodafone-Idea -- argues that the regulations impose excessive burdens without addressing the challenges operators face on the ground.The new rules mandate stricter service quality benchmarks, increased penalties for non-compliance, and more frequent reporting requirements. Telecom operators must now compensate subscribers for outages exceeding 24 hours at the district level and face penalties of up to Rs 10 lakh for violations.However, COAI contends that these measures are impractical given ongoing hurdles such as right-of-way (RoW) issues for infrastructure deployment, interference from unauthorized devices, and theft of equipment. The industry body also highlights the impact of frequent fiber cuts and the additional demands of 5G network rollout. Despite these challenges, telecom operators have consistently met Trai's QoS benchmarks , according to COAI. The industry is seeking a more realistic approach that acknowledges the operational difficulties and avoids placing undue financial pressure on operators.Trai has issued new quality of service (QoS) rules, making it mandatory for telecom operators to compensate subscribers in case of service outages for more than 24 hours at a district level. Trai has also increased the penal amount to Rs 1 lakh from Rs 50,000 for failing to meet each quality benchmark under the new rules.The telecom regulator has introduced a graded penalty system of Rs 1 lakh, Rs 2 lakh, Rs 5 lakh and Rs 10 lakh for different scales of rule violations and submitting false report under revised regulations -- ""The Standards of Quality of Service of Access (Wirelines and Wireless) and Broadband (Wireline and Wireless) Service Regulations, 2024"".Trai has provided a six-month grace period for operators to align their systems with the new regulations.","The Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), representing major telecom players -- Reliance Jio, Airtel and Vodafone-Idea -- argues that the regulations impose excessive burdens.

Delta Airlines seeks compensation for disruption

In mounting problems for CrowdStrike over Microsoft outage last month, the cybersecurity company being sued by air travellers in a latest move. According to a Reuters report, air travellers whose flights were delayed or cancelled on July 19 due to Microsoft Windows outage on July 19 have filed a class action against the company.The plaintiffs include three fliers who filed the lawsuit in the federal court, Austin, Texas.They blame CrowdStrike's negligence in testing and deploying its software for the outage. Adding further, they stated that as fliers scrambled to get to their destinations, many spent hundreds of dollars on lodging, meals and alternative travel, while others missed work or suffered health problems from having to sleep on the airport floor.The filers demand CrowdStrike to pay compensatory and punitive damages to anyone whose flight was disrupted.In a statement, CrowdStrike said ""We believe this case lacks merit and we will vigorously defend the company."" The US cybersecurity company also provided an identical statement in response to a shareholder lawsuit filed on July 31.Delta claims that it faced over 2,200 flight cancellations on July 19 alone, with more than 6,000 flights cancelled since then. The airline is now dealing with over 176,000 refund or reimbursement requests. The estimated cost of the outages could reach as high as $500 million.The company’s CEO Ed Bastian said last week the outage had cost the airline $500 million, adding that it plans to take legal action to get compensation from the cybersecurity firm.Microsoft outage on July 19 was caused by a faulty software update that impacted 8 million Windows computers worldwide. CrowdStrike has rejected Delta Airlines' claim stating that it is ""highly disappointed by Delta's suggestion that CrowdStrike acted inappropriately and strongly rejects any allegation that it was grossly negligent or committed misconduct.""","Air travellers whose flights were delayed or cancelled on July 19 have filed a class action against CrowdStrike.

This marks the first time the DGGI has issued such a notice to a cryptocurrency firm, setting a significant precedent in India’s efforts to regulate the rapidly growing virtual currency market.Sources confirmed that the notice was issued to Binance for collecting fees from Indian customers trading in virtual digital assets (VDAs) on their platform, categorized under online information database access or retrieval (OIDAR) services.Earlier this year, Binance received approval from India’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) to register as a virtual asset service provider (VASP). However, the company was slapped with a Rs 18 crore penalty from the FIU last month for non-compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) regulations.Despite being a major player in the global cryptocurrency market, with at least 40% market share and operations across more than 150 countries, Binance had not registered under the Indian GST framework. This oversight has now brought the company under the scrutiny of Indian tax authorities.“Binance reportedly earned at least Rs 4,000 crore from transaction fees charged to Indian customers. The company has a user base of 90 million users globally, including a substantial number of customers from India too. Detailed investigation revealed that the earnings of these fees were credited to the account of a Binance Group Company — Nest Services Limited — based in Seychelles,” a top source privy to the development said.In fact, Binance is reportedly facing a trial in a Nigerian court for alleged tax evasion, following a crypto crackdown in the country.To make Binance compliant with the GST regulations, DGGI Ahmedabad zonal unit also sent emails to Binance group companies in Seychelles, the Cayman Islands and Switzerland, which did not elicit a response. Binance appointed a local counsel in India to liaise with the DGGI, marking the first step towards resolving this significant tax compliance issue.Sources confirmed that DGGI is also closely monitoring financial transactions and activities of online gaming platforms and marketplaces for the possibility of tax evasion.The Indian GST regime mandates that foreign service providers pay GST for services provided to Indian residents, particularly under the OIDAR category. As the investigation continues, other cryptocurrency exchanges operating both overseas and within India are also expected to face scrutiny from tax authorities, said sources.","The Ahmedabad zonal unit of the Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGGI) has issued a show cause notice to Binance.

The new offering promises lightning-fast 8-16 minute deliveries for a diverse range of products, spanning from groceries to electronics.With this move, Flipkart directly challenges established players in the booming quick commerce sector, including Swiggy's Instamart, Zomato's Blinkit , Zepto , and BigBasket's BB Now.The service, which was previously offered on a trial basis to employees at Flipkart's headquarters, is now available to users through the Flipkart app.We confirmed the service's availability by checking an address in HSR on the Flipkart app, which indeed showed Flipkart Minutes as an option for quick delivery. Additionally, several users on X (formerly Twitter) reported that Flipkart is delivering groceries and other items to their addresses in Bengaluru within minutes through the ""Minutes"" service.Sources familiar with the matter tell the Economic Times that Flipkart plans to expand the service to more areas in Bengaluru over the next few weeks.The launch of Flipkart Minutes comes at a time when other players in the quick commerce space are aggressively expanding their operations.The ET had earlier reported that Flipkart was planning to operate around 100 dark stores to bolster its quick-commerce offerings during the upcoming festive season. Dark stores, which are mini warehouses strategically located for rapid deliveries, have become a crucial component of quick commerce operations.Blinkit, for instance, recently announced ambitious plans to increase its dark store count to 2,000 by 2026. This doubles down on its earlier announced plans to have 1,000 dark stores by March 2025. Similarly, Zepto aims to double its network to 700 dark stores by March 2025. Swiggy Instamart , another major player, currently operates more than 500 such warehouses.Interestingly, Amazon, a key player in the e-commerce space, has not shown interest in the quick-commerce business in India so far. However, it does operate a grocery store service dubbed "" Amazon Fresh ,"" offering same-day delivery for groceries.

What doctor said

An Apple Watch user is crediting the smartwatch for saving his life after the wearable alerted him about a life-threatening condition. Peter Moore , a resident of Montecito, California shared his experience with a local news publisher KTLA. Narrating the incident, he said “I wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for this little device”.Moore, who is a former tech executive, said that he was on his way to the airport when he began to feel “a little lightheaded and a little faint”.“Like a typical male, I thought, ‘I’ll go to Starbucks. That’ll fix it,'” Moore explained before he received a notification from the Apple Watch he was wearing.“My phone started to ping and said ‘low heart rate,’ which I’d never seen before. And so I looked at it… my heart rate had dropped to 32. And it was insistent in its notifications that something wasn’t right,” said Moore. He then contacted his wife who took him to hospital.“The doctor kind of theatrically ran in and said, ‘This is not good. This is not good. You need a pacemaker right now,'” Moore said.Omid Yousefian, the cardiac electrophysiologist at Sansum Clinic Cardiology who treated Moore said “Yes, his watch had a big role in saving his life”.“These days, 25% of the population over the age of 40 … have a high chance of experiencing atrial fibrillation,” Yousefian explained.“For us physicians, symptoms are the most important thing. [Moore] was notified by his watch that his heart rate is slow and he correlated that with the symptoms that he had. So he didn’t wait. He didn’t sit. He came to the hospital directly. So he made a very smart move,” Yousefian told the publication.","Peter Moore, a former tech executive, was on his way to the airport when he began to feel “a little lightheaded and a little faint” He received a notification from the Apple Watch he was wearing that his heart rate had dropped to 32.

What exactly happened

Read the complete post here

In a shocking incident, a Supreme Court lawyer, Mukul P Unny , was scammed out of Rs 38,000 while attempting to exchange his iPhone 13 for an iPhone 15 on Amazon .in. The lawyer detailed his ordeal on social media, highlighting the fraudulent tactics employed by the delivery executive.Unny took X (formerly known as Twitter) to post about the new kind of smartphone exchange scam.The incident occurred on July 21, 2024, when Unny placed an order for the iPhone 15 on Amazon. The following day, a delivery executive arrived at his residence and handed over the new phone after receiving the necessary OTP. However, the executive then requested another OTP, claiming it was required to complete the exchange.Despite Unny's hesitation, he was convinced to return the new iPhone to the delivery executive after speaking to the latter's supervisor.Unny contacted Amazon customer care the following day to report the incident. Initially, Amazon assured him of a refund if the product was not delivered. However, subsequent inquiries revealed the case was under investigation with a resolution deadline of July 31.On July 31st, Amazon concluded its investigation and informed Unny that a refund was impossible. The company's explanation lacked substance, as they had not thoroughly verified the scam details. The fact that Unny still possessed his old iPhone directly contradicted Amazon's claim that the exchange was complete.While Amazon has eventually issued a refund to Unny, his ordeal underscores the considerable risks inherent in online transactions, even when dealing with reputable platforms like Amazon.Always verify the identity of a delivery executive before sharing your Amazon OTP. This crucial step can protect you from falling victim to scams.“This is the story of my worst experience with @amazonIN On 21.07.2024, I ordered iPhone 15 from Amazon in exchange for my iPhone 13. On 22.07.2024, the delivery executive came at around 930 PM. I gave the OTP and took the product, and gave my phone to the executive.He said I have give another OTP. I had already given the OTP and was wondering what other OTP is to be given for exchange. I said I dont have any other OTP than the one I have given. He stayed there for few minutes & then called his supervisor.After speaking with the supervisor, the delivery exec asked for return of the product since the ""exchange is not final"".I insisted that I speak with the supervisor. The supervisor tells me that the exchange is done by a different team & requests for the product to be returned. I said I cannot give away the product especially since the OTP is given and the app was showing that the product is delivered. But this supervisor Ashok (8076650306) requested me to return, lest his team will have to make for the loss.Upon his request and assurance that the product will be ""reattempted"" the next day, I gave the product to the delivery exec (Vishal 8826421956) after taking the supervisor's and the delivery exec's number. On 23.07.2024, I spoke with the Amazon Customer Care and raised a complaint to which I assured that refund will be initiated if the product is not delivered. Call centre asked me to follow up on 25.07.2024.On 26.07.2024,when I called them, the customer case asked me to wait till 31.05.2024 as ""it has to be investigated"". Today, when I call Amazon, they said ""investigation"" is complete and that refund cannot be initiated. No fact-finding was done by Amazon in this. Now, we are staring at a loss of Rs. 38000 and a possible scam done by supervisor, delivery exec and others at Amazon. If they say that the exchange is done, then they can very well see the old phone that I still use with me.This could happen to any one of you and please be aware while dealing with @amazonIN.”","Supreme Court lawyer Mukul P Unny was scammed out of Rs 38,000 while attempting to exchange his iPhone 13 for an iPhone 15 on Amazon.in.
