"CrowdStrike sued by fliers after Microsoft outage disrupted air travel, company responds",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/crowdstrike-sued-by-fliers-after-microsoft-outage-disrupted-air-travel-company-responds/articleshow/112304684.cms,"What CrowdStrike says

Delta Airlines seeks compensation for disruption

In mounting problems for CrowdStrike over Microsoft outage last month, the cybersecurity company being sued by air travellers in a latest move. According to a Reuters report, air travellers whose flights were delayed or cancelled on July 19 due to Microsoft Windows outage on July 19 have filed a class action against the company.The plaintiffs include three fliers who filed the lawsuit in the federal court, Austin, Texas.They blame CrowdStrike's negligence in testing and deploying its software for the outage. Adding further, they stated that as fliers scrambled to get to their destinations, many spent hundreds of dollars on lodging, meals and alternative travel, while others missed work or suffered health problems from having to sleep on the airport floor.The filers demand CrowdStrike to pay compensatory and punitive damages to anyone whose flight was disrupted.In a statement, CrowdStrike said ""We believe this case lacks merit and we will vigorously defend the company."" The US cybersecurity company also provided an identical statement in response to a shareholder lawsuit filed on July 31.Delta claims that it faced over 2,200 flight cancellations on July 19 alone, with more than 6,000 flights cancelled since then. The airline is now dealing with over 176,000 refund or reimbursement requests. The estimated cost of the outages could reach as high as $500 million.The company’s CEO Ed Bastian said last week the outage had cost the airline $500 million, adding that it plans to take legal action to get compensation from the cybersecurity firm.Microsoft outage on July 19 was caused by a faulty software update that impacted 8 million Windows computers worldwide. CrowdStrike has rejected Delta Airlines' claim stating that it is ""highly disappointed by Delta's suggestion that CrowdStrike acted inappropriately and strongly rejects any allegation that it was grossly negligent or committed misconduct.""","Air travellers whose flights were delayed or cancelled on July 19 have filed a class action against CrowdStrike.

"DGCI sends Rs 722 crore GST notice to the world's largest crypto exchange, Binance",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/dgci-sends-rs-722-crore-gst-notice-to-the-worlds-largest-crypto-exchange-binance/articleshow/112304561.cms,"In a groundbreaking move, the Ahmedabad zonal unit of the Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGGI) has issued a show cause notice to Binance , the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange , demanding Goods and Services Tax (GST) payment of Rs 722 crore. This marks the first time the DGGI has issued such a notice to a cryptocurrency firm, setting a significant precedent in India’s efforts to regulate the rapidly growing virtual currency market.Sources confirmed that the notice was issued to Binance for collecting fees from Indian customers trading in virtual digital assets (VDAs) on their platform, categorized under online information database access or retrieval (OIDAR) services.Earlier this year, Binance received approval from India’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) to register as a virtual asset service provider (VASP). However, the company was slapped with a Rs 18 crore penalty from the FIU last month for non-compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) regulations.Despite being a major player in the global cryptocurrency market, with at least 40% market share and operations across more than 150 countries, Binance had not registered under the Indian GST framework. This oversight has now brought the company under the scrutiny of Indian tax authorities.“Binance reportedly earned at least Rs 4,000 crore from transaction fees charged to Indian customers. The company has a user base of 90 million users globally, including a substantial number of customers from India too. Detailed investigation revealed that the earnings of these fees were credited to the account of a Binance Group Company — Nest Services Limited — based in Seychelles,” a top source privy to the development said.In fact, Binance is reportedly facing a trial in a Nigerian court for alleged tax evasion, following a crypto crackdown in the country.To make Binance compliant with the GST regulations, DGGI Ahmedabad zonal unit also sent emails to Binance group companies in Seychelles, the Cayman Islands and Switzerland, which did not elicit a response. Binance appointed a local counsel in India to liaise with the DGGI, marking the first step towards resolving this significant tax compliance issue.Sources confirmed that DGGI is also closely monitoring financial transactions and activities of online gaming platforms and marketplaces for the possibility of tax evasion.The Indian GST regime mandates that foreign service providers pay GST for services provided to Indian residents, particularly under the OIDAR category. As the investigation continues, other cryptocurrency exchanges operating both overseas and within India are also expected to face scrutiny from tax authorities, said sources.","The Ahmedabad zonal unit of the Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGGI) has issued a show cause notice to Binance.

How to identify Amazon OTP scam

Meanwhile, if you are a victim of cybercrime, register your complaint with the National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal at https://cybercrime.gov.in/ or call 1930.

Amazon Great Freedom Festival sale is here and as shoppers flock to the e-commerce platform for shopping, scammers are also gearing up to capitalise on the increased online activity. One common tactic employed by fraudsters is the OTP scam. Numerous individuals have fallen victim to this scheme in the past, prompting Amazon to issue warnings to its customers.Since people usually spend thousands of their hard-earned money, it becomes crucial to remain vigilant and protect personal information during this sale period, especially from scammers requesting sign-in OTP via phone calls.In a communication shared with customers recently, Amazon said that scammers are adopting multiple tactics to defraud unsuspecting shoppers. A growing number of individuals have reported receiving phone calls from individuals posing as Amazon customer service representatives or delivery agents. These scammers aim to steal personal information, including login credentials, by manipulating victims into revealing sensitive data.Scammers often try to create a sense of urgency, stating that there has been an unexpected order or delivery which may not have been placed by a potential victim. The scammers will then ask for a sign-in One-Time Password (OTP) to cancel the delivery.A confused ‘customer’ then shares the OTP thinking that he/ she has averted the hassle of package delivery, however in reality, the scammer has gained access to the account. Shoppers must note that Amazon will never ask its customers to share their account sign-in OTP or passcode, especially over the phone to avoid being scammed.“If you receive communication — a call, text, or email — that you think may not be from Amazon, please report it to us at, amazon.in/reportascam,” it said.Last year, Amazon India and the Uttar Pradesh Police joined hands to fight fraud and protect online shoppers from bad actors. They launched a consumer education and awareness campaign named #MissionGraHAQ.","Amazon Great Freedom Festival sale is here and as shoppers flock to the e-commerce platform for shopping, scammers are gearing up to capitalise on the increased online activity.

"Donald Trump says, ""Something’s wrong with Google""",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/donald-trump-says-somethings-wrong-with-google/articleshow/112298674.cms,"Google response to Elon Musk claims

Google seems to be having a bad day. On the day, a US judge ruled against the company in the long-going antitrust case, there was more in the offing for the company. Republican nominee Donald Trump , who reportedly seemed miffed with Google, has called upon his supporters to stop using Google.In an interview to video-game celebrity Adin Ross, Trump called for his supporters to stop using Google, calling the search engine “illegitimate”.“Something’s wrong with Google,” Trump said in the interview. “Everybody should maybe just go off Google, not use it.”Trump was reportedly referring to claims from Tesla CEO Elon Musk and others that Google is interfering with efforts to find information about the former president. Last month, accusing Google of ‘election interference,’ Musk shared a screenshot of ‘President Donald’ search on Google on social media site X and wrote, “Wow, Google has a search ban on President Donald Trump! Election interference?”Donald Trump Jr too made similar claims, sharing an image on X that purportedly showed a Google search box with auto-complete options for a query on assassination attempts that does not mention Trump. Trump Jr termed it “intentional election interference from Google.”Trump’s VP candidate, JD Vance, has also taken a not-so-favorable approach to Big Tech. Vance has questioned Meta Platforms ownership of both Facebook and Instagram as well as Google’s ownership of YouTube. The senator has reportedly also expressed concern about Google’s Gemini artificial intelligence project.Responding to Musk's accusation of ‘censoring’ searches about Donald Trump, Google issued a long note on X, formerly Twitter. “Over the past few days, some people on X have posted claims that Search is 'censoring' or 'banning' particular terms. That’s not happening, and we want to set the record straight. The posts relate to our Autocomplete feature, which predicts queries to save you time. Autocomplete is just a tool to help you complete a search quickly. Regardless of what predictions it shows at any given moment, you can always search for whatever you want and get easy access to results, images and more,” Google stated.","Republican nominee Donald Trump has called upon his supporters to stop using Google.

10-week trial that saw Sundar Pichai, Satya Nadella and others

A federal judge has ruled that Google abused its dominant position in the search and advertising markets, marking a significant victory for the Department of Justice. “After having carefully considered and weighed the witness testimony and evidence, the court reached the following conclusion: Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,” said the court’s ruling.“It has violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act.”Judge Amit Mehta found Google guilty of violating antitrust law by engaging in anti-competitive practices to maintain its monopoly. The Department of Justice (DoJ) argued that Google illegally stifled competition by paying billions to maintain its default search engine status on devices like iPhones and by imposing restrictive conditions on phone manufacturers using its Android operating system. The company countered that its market dominance was earned through superior products and that it faced intense competition from other tech platforms.This case is part of a broader government push to rein in the power of big tech companies. Similar antitrust lawsuits have been filed against Amazon, Apple, and Meta. The outcome of this case will likely influence how future cases are handled and could reshape the competitive landscape of the tech industry. The case against Google was filed by the Department of Justice and a bipartisan group of attorneys general from 38 states and territories, led by Colorado and Nebraska, filed similar but separate antitrust suits against Google in 2020. The suits were reportedly combined for pretrial purposes.The ruling, while a major setback for the tech giant, is just the first step in a lengthy legal process that will determine the consequences of Google's actions. It is a clear win for antitrust regulators, however, the full impact on Google's business remains to be seen. Potential remedies could include forcing Google to divest parts of its business, imposing behavioral restrictions, or imposing hefty fines.Mehta oversaw a 10-week trial in the Google search case which culminated in two days of closing arguments in early May. The trial saw many big players in Silicon Valley including Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Apple executive Eddy Cue take to the witness box. The DOJ argued that Google illegally monopolized the general search advertising market by effectively cutting off key distribution channels for rivals through exclusionary contracts.",A federal judge has ruled that Google abused its dominant position in the search and advertising markets.

World's top fund management company to investors: The company that replaced Apple and Microsoft to become the world's most-valuable is in a “bubble”,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/worlds-top-fund-management-company-to-investors-the-company-that-replaced-apple-and-microsoft-to-become-the-worlds-most-valuable-is-in-a-bubble/articleshow/112297977.cms,"AI has ""failed to deliver""

Hedge fund giant Elliott Management has cast doubt on the meteoric rise of AI chip giant Nvidia, labelling the chipmaker as a ""bubble"" and dismissing the hype around artificial intelligence. In a letter to investors, seen by Financial Times, the fund management company expressed scepticism about the sustainability of Nvidia 's soaring stock price, driven largely by the frenzied demand for its chips, crucial for powering AI applications.Despite the massive investments made by tech giants like Microsoft , Meta, and Amazon in AI infrastructure, Elliott believes this spending spree might not be perpetual.For those unaware, Nvidia has seen a meteoric rise in its market value in the past one year. The company surpassed Microsoft and Apple to become the world's most-valuable company in June this year for a few days. ""We believe over the next year the race to $4 trillion market cap in tech will be front and centre between Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft,"" Wedbush Securities' analysts had said in a note to investors in June.The hedge fund also raised concerns about the practical applications of AI, arguing that many touted uses are either economically unfeasible, technically impractical, or pose significant risks. While acknowledging AI's potential, Elliott contends that the technology has yet to deliver substantial productivity gains beyond basic tasks like summarising meetings or generating reports.Founded by billionaire Paul Singer in 1977, Elliot has reportedly added in its client letter that, so far, AI had failed to deliver a promised huge uplift in productivity.Nvidia's stock has experienced a significant downturn since reaching a peak in June, reflecting growing investor concerns about the sustainability of the AI boom. Although the chipmaker remains significantly higher than its pre-AI rally levels, Elliott warns that a disappointing earnings report could trigger a market crash.Despite its critical stance, Elliott admits to having avoided shorting tech giants due to the high risks involved. The firm has largely steered clear of the ""magnificent seven"" tech stocks, including Nvidia, opting for a more cautious approach in the face of market exuberance.Elliott's assessment adds to the growing chorus of voices questioning the long-term viability of the AI frenzy and raising concerns about potential overvaluation in the tech sector.","Elliott Management has cast doubt on the sustainability of the AI boom.

"Intel to layoff over 15,000 employees: Read the memo shared by company’s CEO",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/intel-to-layoff-over-15000-employees-read-the-memo-shared-by-companys-ceo/articleshow/112211785.cms,"Here’s the full text of the memo shared by Intel CEO

Team,

We have moved our All Company Meeting to today, following our earnings call, as we are announcing significant actions to reduce our costs. We plan to deliver $10 billion in

cost savings

in 2025, and this includes reducing our head count by roughly 15,000 roles, or 15% of our workforce. The majority of these actions will be completed by the end of this year.

This is painful news for me to share. I know it will be even more difficult for you to read. This is an incredibly hard day for Intel as we are making some of the most consequential changes in our company’s history. When we meet in a few hours, I’ll talk about why we’re doing this and what you can expect in the coming weeks. In advance of that, I wanted to preview some of what’s on my mind.

Simply put, we must align our cost structure with our new operating model and fundamentally change the way we operate. Our revenues have not grown as expected – and we’ve yet to fully benefit from powerful trends, like AI. Our costs are too high, our margins are too low. We need bolder actions to address both – particularly given our financial results and outlook for the second half of 2024, which is tougher than previously expected.

These decisions have challenged me to my core, and this is the hardest thing I’ve done in my career. My pledge to you is that we will prioritize a culture of honesty, transparency and respect in the weeks and months to come.

Next week, we’ll announce a companywide enhanced retirement offering for eligible employees and broadly offer an application program for voluntary departures. I believe that how we implement these changes is just as important as the changes themselves, and we will adhere to Intel values throughout this process.

Why Now?

Since introducing our new operating model, we have taken a clean-sheet view of the business and assessed ourselves against benchmarks for high-performing foundries, fabless product companies and corporate functions. This work made it clear our cost structure is not competitive.

For example, our annual revenue in 2020 was about $24 billion higher than it was last year, yet our current workforce is actually 10% larger now than it was then. There are a lot of reasons for this, but it’s not a sustainable path forward.

Beyond our costs, we need to change the way we operate – something many of you shared as part of our Employee Experience Survey. There’s too much complexity, so we need to both automate and simplify processes. It takes too long for decisions to be made, so we need to eliminate bureaucracy. And there’s too much inefficiency in the system, so we need to expedite workflows.

Key Priorities

The actions we are taking will make Intel a leaner, simpler and more agile company. Let me highlight our areas of focus:

Reducing Operational Costs: We will drive companywide operational and cost efficiencies, including the cost savings and head count reductions mentioned above.

Simplifying Our Portfolio: We will complete actions this month to simplify our businesses. Each business unit is conducting a portfolio review and identifying underperforming products. We are also integrating key software assets into our business units so we accelerate our shift to systems-based solutions. And we will narrow our incubation focus on fewer, more impactful projects.

Eliminating Complexity: We will reduce layers, eliminate overlapping areas of responsibility, stop non-essential work, and foster a culture of greater ownership and accountability. For example, we will consolidate Customer Success into the Sales, Marketing and Communications Group to streamline our go-to-market motions.

Reducing Capital and Other Costs: With the completion of our historic five-nodes-in-four-years roadmap clearly in sight, we will review all active projects and equipment so we begin to shift our focus toward capital efficiency and more normalized spending levels. This will reduce our 2024 capital expenditures by more than 20%, and we plan to reduce our non-variable cost of goods sold by roughly $1 billion in 2025.

Suspending Our Dividend: We will suspend our stock dividend beginning next quarter to prioritize investments in the business and drive more sustained profitability.

Maintaining Growth Investments: Our IDM2.0 strategy is unchanged. Having fought hard to reestablish our innovation engine, we will maintain the key investments in our process technology and core product leadership.

The Future

I have no illusions that the path in front of us will be easy. You shouldn’t either. This is a tough day for all of us and there will be more tough days ahead. But as difficult as all of this is, we are making the changes necessary to build on our progress and usher in a new era of growth.

When we began this journey, we set our sights high, knowing that Intel is a place where big ideas are born and the power of what’s possible triumphs over the status quo. After all, our mission is to create world-changing technologies that improve the lives of every person on the planet. And at our best, we have exemplified these ideals more than any company in the world.

To live up to this mission, we must continue to drive our IDM 2.0 strategy, which remains the same: re-establish process technology leadership; invest in at-scale, globally resilient supply chain by expanding manufacturing capacity in the U.S. and EU; become a world-class, leading-edge foundry for internal and external customers; rebuild product portfolio leadership; and deliver AI Everywhere.

Over the past few years, we have rebuilt a sustainable innovation engine that is largely in place and on track. It’s now time to focus on building the sustainable financial engine needed to drive our performance. We must improve our execution, adapt to new market realities and operate as a more agile company. That’s the spirit of the actions we are taking – knowing that the choices we make today, as difficult as they are, will strengthen our ability to serve our customers and grow our business for years to come.

As we take these next steps in our journey, let’s not forget that there has never been a greater need for what we do. The world will increasingly run on silicon – and the world needs a healthy and vibrant Intel. That’s why the work we are doing is so consequential. Not only are we remaking a great company, but we are also creating technology and manufacturing capabilities that will reshape the world for decades to come. And this is something we should never lose sight of as we push forward in pursuit of our goals.

We’ll talk more in a few hours. Please come with your questions so we can have an open and honest discussion about what comes next.

'Breach discovered two days ago'

NEW DELHI: A ransomware attack has forced the temporary shutdown of payment systems across nearly 300 small Indian local banks, according to reports. The customers of these banks have not been able to access payments services like withdrawing cash at ATMs or using United Payments Interface (UPI).The ransomware attack affected C-Edge Technologies , a provider of banking technology systems to small banks across the country, reports said.Other banking services are functioning normally, the officials told news agency PTI.In a statement released late in the evening, the national payments corporation of India (NPCI) said, ""C-Edge Technologies….has been possibly impacted by a ransomware attack impacting a few of their systems,"" leading to the temporary isolation of C-Edge from accessing NPCI-operated retail payment systems.Dileep Sanghani, chairman of the national cooperative union of India, told news agency PTI that nearly 300 banks in India, including 17 district cooperative banks in Gujarat, which rely on C-Edge, have been facing issues for the past two to three days.""All online transactions, such as RTGS and UPI payments, are affected. Money is deducted from the sender's account but does not get credited in the receiver's account,"" Sanghani said.""Customers of banks serviced by C-Edge will not be able to access payment systems during the period of isolation,"" the NPCI told news agency Reuters.The statement also mentioned that restoration work is being carried out rapidly in collaboration with C-Edge Technologies, and a mandatory security review is underway.C-Edge, a joint venture between SBI and TCS, serves cooperative banks and regional rural banks, which have been affected by the breach. Officials stated that other banking services remained unaffected. To protect the broader payments system, necessary precautions, including isolating the C-Edge system, had to be implemented following the discovery of the breach two days ago.An industry official told news agency PTI that a ransomware had been detected and isolated within the system, prompting a third-party audit.The official told news agency PTI that the affected banks represent less than 1 percent of the total payment system volume in the country.Despite the incident, no financial losses have been reported, news agency PTI said.","Customers of these banks have not been able to access payments services like withdrawing cash at ATMs or using United Payments Interface (UPI) The ransomware attack affected C-Edge Technologies, a provider of banking technology systems to small banks across the country.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112175695,imgsize-1564323,width-400,resizemode-4/112175695.jpg"
"Reliance Jio, Airtel and Vodafone-Idea 'unhappy' with Trai's new QoS rules; say overlook ground realities",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/reliance-jio-airtel-and-vodafone-idea-unhappy-with-trais-new-qos-rules-say-overlook-ground-realities/articleshow/112268723.cms,"COAI statement

COAI’s member Telecom Service Providers (TSPs) have consistently invested in enhancing Quality of Service (QoS) through significant improvements in network infrastructure, resulting in greater stability and reliability. The industry has embraced advanced technologies and automation tools, including predictive maintenance and AI-driven analytics, to proactively address network issues. Moreover, major initiatives are underway to fiberize towers across India, which is a crucial step for the efficient deployment of 5G services.

While TRAI has tightened the QoS benchmarks over the years, the ground realities remain unchanged. TSPs still grapple with Right of Way (RoW) issues when acquiring permissions for infrastructure deployment in public and private land for the installation of cell towers and fiber-optic cables. The situation is further aggravated due to additional requirement of street furniture for the 5G networks. Moreover, interference from various sources, such as other wireless devices and electromagnetic interference, degrade signal quality and network performance. Further, illegal boosters and repeaters used by unauthorised agents, as well as the cases of theft of equipment are also external factors which, nevertheless, impact the QoS. Besides, frequent takedown of the overhead fiber by the authorities have a significant impact in QoS as well. TSPs have limited control over these external sources which adversely impact the Quality of Services.

Despite these challenges, TSPs have consistently met TRAI's QoS benchmarks. The industry expresses concern over the proposed regulations, which not only tighten benchmarks but also shift from quarterly to monthly reporting and site to cell level reporting in many cases. In fact, the QoS parameters prescribed in the new Regulations have not been introduced by any other regulator in other similar economies. These changes are expected to significantly increase the compliance as well as the cost burden on telecom operators, and without commensurate benefits for the customers.

While we are disappointed with the stringency of these new regulations, we remain committed to engaging constructively with TRAI on QoS-related matters. Our member organizations will continue to strive for excellence in service quality while advocating for regulations that recognize the practical challenges faced by our industry.

What are the new QoS rules

The telecom industry has raised concerns over stringent new quality of service (QoS) norms introduced by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India ( Trai ). The Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), representing major telecom players -- Reliance Jio , Airtel and Vodafone-Idea -- argues that the regulations impose excessive burdens without addressing the challenges operators face on the ground.The new rules mandate stricter service quality benchmarks, increased penalties for non-compliance, and more frequent reporting requirements. Telecom operators must now compensate subscribers for outages exceeding 24 hours at the district level and face penalties of up to Rs 10 lakh for violations.However, COAI contends that these measures are impractical given ongoing hurdles such as right-of-way (RoW) issues for infrastructure deployment, interference from unauthorized devices, and theft of equipment. The industry body also highlights the impact of frequent fiber cuts and the additional demands of 5G network rollout. Despite these challenges, telecom operators have consistently met Trai's QoS benchmarks , according to COAI. The industry is seeking a more realistic approach that acknowledges the operational difficulties and avoids placing undue financial pressure on operators.Trai has issued new quality of service (QoS) rules, making it mandatory for telecom operators to compensate subscribers in case of service outages for more than 24 hours at a district level. Trai has also increased the penal amount to Rs 1 lakh from Rs 50,000 for failing to meet each quality benchmark under the new rules.The telecom regulator has introduced a graded penalty system of Rs 1 lakh, Rs 2 lakh, Rs 5 lakh and Rs 10 lakh for different scales of rule violations and submitting false report under revised regulations -- ""The Standards of Quality of Service of Access (Wirelines and Wireless) and Broadband (Wireline and Wireless) Service Regulations, 2024"".Trai has provided a six-month grace period for operators to align their systems with the new regulations.","The Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), representing major telecom players -- Reliance Jio, Airtel and Vodafone-Idea -- argues that the regulations impose excessive burdens.

Here’s what he wrote in his LinkedIn post

I got fired back on 25th August 2005.

At the time, I was a Sr. Program Manager at Microsoft in Hyderabad.

No warning, no explanation - just a cheque and shown the door.

The mix of emotions I felt: anger, confusion, and that sinking feeling of failure was overwhelming.

I called my wife, and she asked me to drive straight home.

Instead of lashing out or drowning in self-pity, my wife and I sat down and talked and wrote down our choices.

Acceptance didn't come easy, but it was the first step.

Determined to find closure, I decided to meet my former manager in a coffee shop. And it was amazing to have unrestricted conversation and his nudging me to let go and move along.

Then began the relentless job hunt. Days blurred into nights of networking, improving resumes, and gathering the courage to call old contacts.

This 3 week period was tough, but I eventually found my place at

.

Looking back, that firing was a turning point. It forced me to confront my fears, re-evaluate my goals, and ultimately find a path that was more aligned with my true likes.

By the way - I owe who I am today to Microsoft. What felt like a blow to my career was actually a blessing in disguise.

With all the recent

happening, if you're going through a similar nightmare, know this: you're not alone. This might be taking you a step closer to your best self.

It's okay to feel angry, lost, or defeated.

Take a moment, breathe, and then gather your strength.

Reach out to your support system and start planning your comeback.

Because here's the truth: setbacks happen, but they don't define you; your response to them does.

Trust the process, because your next chapter could be just around the corner. :)

Google Pixel 9 series’ Tensor G4 chip may not get major upgrades,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/mobiles-tabs/google-pixel-9-series-tensor-g4-chip-may-not-get-major-upgrades/articleshow/112200277.cms,"Google 's upcoming Pixel 9 series, set to launch on August 13, will feature the new Tensor G4 chip . While the overall upgrade may be modest, the chip's improved modem could significantly enhance user experience, according to recent reports.The Tensor G4, as revealed by Android Authority, maintains many components from its predecessor but introduces a new CPU configuration and an upgraded modem.The chip adopts a 1+3+4 core layout, featuring newer ARMv9.2 cores: one Cortex-X4, three Cortex-A720, and four Cortex-A520. These cores are clocked slightly higher than those in the Tensor G3 .The most notable improvement comes from the Exynos Modem 5400 , which reportedly offers up to 50% better power consumption compared to the previous Exynos Modem 5300. This enhancement could address long-standing issues of heat generation and battery drain in Pixel devices, particularly when using cellular data.Android Authority's source indicates that the Tensor G4 retains many custom components from the G3, including the Titan M2 security chip and the TPU (Tensor Processing Unit). The chip's packaging process reportedly remains unchanged, using Samsung 's FOPLP (Fan-Out Panel Level Packaging) technology.Interestingly, the report mentions that not all Tensor G4 devices may benefit from the new modem. A future device, possibly the Pixel 9a , might use the older Exynos Modem 5300 instead.",Google's upcoming Pixel 9 series will feature the new Tensor G4 chip.
