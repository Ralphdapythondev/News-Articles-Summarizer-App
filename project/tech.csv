Why Intel is selling 49% of Irish Venture to Apollo for $11 billion,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-intel-is-selling-49-of-irish-venture-to-apollo-for-11-billion/articleshow/110746746.cms,"Why the need for external funding for Intel

Intel Corp has reportedly struck a deal with Apollo Global Management Inc to sell a stake in a venture controlling an Irish plant for $11 billion. According to a report in Bloomberg, this move aims to secure additional funding for Intel's significant factory network expansion.The investment firm will acquire a 49% stake in a joint venture that operates Intel's Fab 34 facility, marking the second such investment program for Intel to ease the financial burden of its ambitious expansion plans.Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger is reportedly spearheading a costly endeavor to regain the top spot in the semiconductor industry. This involves substantial investments in product revamping and global factory construction to strengthen Intel's manufacturing capabilities and attract external clients for outsourced production.The once industry leader, Intel, has been compelled to seek external funding through its ""Smart Capital"" program.""The announcement underscores Intel's ongoing progress in its transformation strategy,"" the company stated in a press release. ""The company is making continued strides to establish financial flexibility and expedite its strategy, including investments in global manufacturing operations, all while preserving a strong balance sheet"".Construction of the plant, situated on an existing Intel site near Dublin, Ireland, is nearing completion, according to the company. The transaction, finalizing in the second quarter of 2024, frees up capital for Intel to invest elsewhere. Fab 34 will utilize Intel's 4 and 3 manufacturing technologies.The agreement mandates that Intel purchase a minimum amount of the factory's output for its own sales or on behalf of clients. The pact also prioritizes Fab 34 for production within Intel's network.In 2022, Intel secured a $15 billion commitment from Brookfield Infrastructure Partners LP to help finance an Arizona semiconductor complex, alleviating initial concerns regarding the excessive costs of Gelsinger's revitalization plan.However, a series of disappointing earnings reports and market share losses to competitors like Nvidia Corp. have reignited those anxieties and negatively impacted Intel's stock price.","Intel Corp has reportedly struck a deal with Apollo Global Management Inc to sell a stake in a venture controlling an Irish plant for $11 billion.

Higher attrition rates

Efforts to improve gender diversity

In the fiscal year ending March 2024, five of India's leading IT services companies—Infosys, TCS, Wipro, LTI Mindtree, and HCL Tech—experienced a cumulative net exit of 25,000 women employees. This data, compiled by staffing firm Xpheno, highlights a concerning trend in gender diversity within these organisations.Despite a notable increase in the absolute number of women employed since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the growth in the diversity ratio has stagnated. From March 2020 to March 2023, the number of women in these firms increased from approximately 374,000 to 540,000. However, by the end of FY24, this number had decreased to 515,000.According to an ET report, the total number of women employees grew by about 141,000 (38%) between 2020 and 2024, but the diversity ratio only saw a marginal increase of 0.9 percentage points. This indicates a parallel increase in the hiring of male employees, resulting in a flat diversity ratio.“Such parallel growth in intake scale will continue to drive constant and flat gender ratios as we are witnessing now,” commented Shincy Morris, Business Head - Direct Hiring at Xpheno.In the January-March 2024 quarter, the average diversity ratio stood at 34.26%, a slight decline from 34.32% in the previous year. Pre-pandemic years (2018-2020) saw a stronger growth in diversity, with an increase of 1.56 percentage points among the five IT firms.Data from Avtar Group, a prominent diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) solutions company, reveals a significant drop-off in women reaching leadership roles in the Indian IT industry. The diversity ratio at the senior level is just 17%, compared to 35% at the entry level.“This lack of progression can be discouraging for ambitious women,” said Saundarya Rajesh, Founder-President of Avtar Group. “Imagine dedicating yourself to a field, only to face constant hurdles to advancement and fair compensation. Feeling undervalued and passed over for promotions can be incredibly demotivating.”Women in the tech sector face higher attrition rates, with a 26% attrition rate compared to 21% across all industry sectors, according to Avtar’s data. The pressure to excel in a demanding field while managing personal commitments leads to burnout, resulting in high attrition rates.“Clearly, the lack of advancement opportunities is discouraging for new hires from diverse backgrounds,” added Rajesh.In recent years, there has been a rise in programs aimed at attracting and retaining high-potential women in the tech workforce. According to Avtar’s data, post-pandemic DEI intent has increased from 73% to 77%.“It is crucial that these programmes have the buy-in of the CEOs. Hiring a bunch of people who are ‘different’ candidates does not guarantee inclusion,” emphasised Rajesh.Krishna Vij, Business Head at Teamlease Digital, remarked, “Tackling the gender gap in leadership positions is crucial. This can be achieved by implementing policies that support women during pivotal life stages, such as offering flexible work arrangements, mentorship programs, and promoting return-to-work initiatives for those re-entering the workforce after a career hiatus.”","Infosys, TCS, Wipro, LTI Mindtree, and HCL Tech experienced a cumulative net exit of 25,000 women employees in the fiscal year ending March 2024.

If users switch to the Canary or Dev Channels, they will have a small window to roll back to Windows 10 but once this window closes, the only way to go back to the Beta Channel and/or Windows 10 will be to do a clean install of Windows.

For Insiders on a Windows 10 PC that don’t meet the minimum system requirements for Windows 11:



Users will not see the option to switch to the Canary or Dev Channels as these channels are only for Windows 11 Insider Preview builds.

The Windows 10 end-of-support date of October 14, 2025, is unchanged. Joining the Beta Channel on your Windows 10 PC won’t change that.

Microsoft ended the beta channel for Windows Insiders on Windows 10 at the end of 2023. The US-based tech giant announced this change to ensure users get the maximum value from their current Windows PC. Now, to bring new features and more improvements to Windows 10 the company will still need a place to do active feature development with Windows Insiders.This has led Microsoft to re-open the Beta Channel for Windows Insiders currently on Windows 10. This will allow the company to try out new features for Windows 10, version 22H2, with Insiders before releasing them to all Windows 10 customers.In a blog post, the company has confirmed that Windows Insiders who want to try out new features for Windows 10 can join or switch to the Beta Channel. Users can do this by going to Settings > Update & Security > Windows Insider Program. Here, users need to click on the current Insider Channel selection to expand and see the full list of Insider Channels and choose Beta Channel.Many features in the Beta Channel will be rolled out using Control Feature Rollout technology, starting with a subset of Insiders and ramping up over time as we monitor feedback to see how they land before pushing them out to everyone in this channel.Insiders in the Beta Channel who want to be the first to get features gradually rolled out to you can turn ON the toggle to get the latest updates as they are available via Settings > Updated & Security > Windows Update.Over time, Microsoft will increase the rollouts of features to everyone with the toggle turned on.

Apple TV+ may become the first US streaming service to be ‘officially’ available in China,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-tv-may-become-the-first-us-streaming-service-to-be-officially-available-in-china/articleshow/110744060.cms,"Apple's plans to launch the service in 2023



Appe TV+ may come to China at a lower price



Apple is reportedly planning to launch Apple TV+ in China and has already held talks with the country’s telecom giant China Mobile for the same. According to a report by The Information, if the Cupertino-based tech giant strikes a deal, Apple TV+ would become the only US streaming service to have a presence in China.Typically, Chinese law prevents US services from distributing their content directly.The report claims that under the proposed deal, China Mobile may offer Apple TV+ subscription for a monthly fee, and may even feature its content on the company’s set-top boxes. Apple and China Mobile are expected to split the revenue from the arrangement.However, if a deal has been finalised, it would likely not allow for the iPhone TV app to include Apple’s content in the region, as that would violate Chinese law, the report added.Apple apparently wanted to announce the partnership last year. However, that didn’t happen as something fell through. Previous reports suggested that talks between the two companies were said to be underway at the end of 2023. The report also doesn’t reveal the current status of the negotiations as well.Like many emerging markets, content subscriptions services are usually offered at far cheaper prices in China than in the US. For example,Apple Music in China is less than $2 per month compared to $10.99 per month in the US.As per the report, Apple TV+ would also likely be offered at a significantly lower price in China. The prices may remain lower due to weaker consumer pricing power and as most of Apple’s content is English-centric, the report noted.However, assuming that the legal and business operational challenges can be navigated, the potential economic rewards may be huge due to the size of China’s population. The report also claims that Apple is also exploring ways to launch other services offerings like Apple Arcade in China as well.Last week, rumours claimed that Apple is developing a TV app for Android which will be another attempt at reaching a new base of subscribers.","Apple is reportedly planning to launch Apple TV+ in China in 2023.

Intel has a plan to regain its leadership in the chipmaking space. At Computex 2024, the US-based company announced its Lunar Lake, AI accelerator processors and Intel’s Xeon 6 chips. Speaking on these lines, company CEO Pat Gelsinger has said that Intel wants to build “everybody’s AI chips .“We want to build everybody’s chips, everybody’s AI chips. We want them to be built leveraging the U.S. factories,” Gelsinger told CNBC.Intel has been overtaken by rivals TSMC and Samsung in recent years, and at the same time, is facing tough competition from Qualcomm, Nvidia and AMD.Intel was the world’s largest chipmaker but in 2017, Samsung Electronics surpassed it in revenue. TSMC, which makes chips for Apple, reportedly leapfrogged Samsung in 2023 to become the world’s largest foundry by revenue.“The first piece is to get back to leadership, because a lot of the losses are associated with having uncompetitive process technology,” said Gelsinger.Intel posted an operating loss of $7 billion in 2023 as it looks to boost its struggling foundry business. It is currently not in the top six foundries by revenue, a Counterpoint Research report said last month.Intel recently got $8.5 billion in CHIPS and Science Act funding from the Biden administration and may potentially get another $11 billion. The capital is likely to help Intel advance its semiconductor manufacturing, research and development.“The capital is critical. And what we said is that we have to have economic competitiveness if we’re going to build these factories in the US and that’s what the chips Act has done. It’s created a level playing field if I were building a factory in Asia versus US,” Gelsinger said.","Intel has a plan to regain its leadership in the chipmaking space.

How setting your AC to the default temperature is important



Humidity can force you to decrease temperature



Proper airflow will cool your room faster



Smart ACs can add to convenience



This question related to AC must have popped up in your head: What is the ideal temperature for the air conditioning (AC) while sleeping? Well, it is important to find the perfect balance between staying cool and maintaining energy efficiency becomes a priority as the scorching summer heat takes hold. Having said that, the answer is not straightforward.According to a government advisory shared in consultation with the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) fixed the default temperature according to new energy performance standards for Room Air Conditioner (RACs)., the advisory says.Setting the right temperature while sleeping can also help you save your electricity bills . Air conditioners consume more energy to maintain lower temperatures. The closer the indoor temperature is to the outdoor temperature, the less the AC has to work, resulting in lower energy consumption.By setting your AC to an optimal temperature while you sleep, you can significantly reduce energy usage and save on electricity bills . Also, setting the temperature to 18 won’t make your AC cool faster but will consume more electricity. So it’s better to keep the AC in its default temperature.High humidity can make a room feel warmer than it is. Using a dehumidifier alongside your AC can help maintain a comfortable environment.Proper air circulation can enhance the cooling effect of your AC. Consider using a ceiling fan or a portable fan to help distribute cool air more evenly.Smart ACs can be controlled through your smartphone and will allow you to set different temperatures for different times of the day. You can program it to cool your bedroom just before bedtime and raise the temperature slightly as you wake up.","The default temperature has been fixed according to new energy performance standards for Room Air Conditioner (RACs) Air conditioners consume more energy to maintain lower temperatures.

As India undergoes its largest democratic exercise, the Lok Sabha Elections 2024 , WhatsApp’s Tipline has emerged as a crucial tool for combating the spread of deepfakes and misinformation. Created by the Misinformation Combat Alliance’s (MCA) Deepfakes Analysis Unit (DAU), the Tipline aims to raise public awareness and provide assistance in identifying AI-manipulated content.: Launched in March 2024, WhatsApp’s Tipline has quickly become a trusted resource for users seeking to verify the authenticity of images and videos. Since its inception, the Tipline has received hundreds of messages from users asking for help in distinguishing real from fake content.: The Tipline is accessible in multiple languages, including Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, and English, making it widely usable across India’s diverse linguistic landscape.Users can flag suspected deepfake content by sending audio notes or videos to the Tipline. The process is listed below:Most of the manipulated content received involves doctored videos where the original audio is altered using AI to make a person appear to say something they did not. These videos often feature prominent figures such as actors, businessmen, politicians, and TV anchors. Additionally, AI-created memes of politicians using face-blending techniques or other less sophisticated methods have been commonly reported.WhatsApp’s Tipline uses advanced generative AI to analyze and detect deepfakes. This involves reconstructing the mouth movements of subjects to sync with altered audio, making the deepfakes appear more convincing.Pamposh Raina, Head of the DAU, emphasized the collaborative nature of the DAU’s approach. By partnering with detection and forensic experts, the DAU supports its fact-checking partners who play a critical role in this project. Raina stated, “The strength of the DAU lies in the collaborative model which it is building by partnering with detection and forensic experts. Our goal is to drive public awareness on the issue of algorithm-based fabrication, and I am confident that this symbiotic model can be replicated globally to combat misinformation spread through audio and video content produced using generative AI.”The successful implementation of WhatsApp’s Tipline during the Lok Sabha elections 2024 highlights the potential of such tools in combating misinformation. As deepfake technology continues to evolve, the need for robust detection and public awareness mechanisms becomes increasingly critical. WhatsApp’s initiative sets a precedent for similar efforts worldwide, showcasing how technology and collaboration can effectively address the challenges posed by AI-generated misinformation.",WhatsApp’s Tipline uses advanced generative AI to analyze and detect deepfakes.

Airtel’s $100-billion market cap is testimony to today’s India

A meeting with PM Narendra Modi in September of the year 2018 proved to be a turning point for Airtel, according to Bharti Airtel chairman Sunil Bharti Mittal. In an exclusive interview to Economic Times, Mittal spoke about a range of things including his meeting with PM Modi, Airtel's journey to $100 billion market capitalisation and more.Mittal recalled Reliance Jio's entry in the year 2016 and how it turned the industry upside down. ""September 2016 was the Jio launch and 2018 was the time when I think the industry was in the most distress… Ebitda had crashed due to the free services. We had to keep going down (in terms of tariffs). Then the first losses started at that time after many years and debt was pretty high. So the company was shaky. And in March 2018, I still recall that you could sense a concern among the rank and file of the company. You could see it on the faces of professionals working at Airtel. Company after company was folding up — Tatas selling to us, three companies going into NCLT. And that was the time that the regulatory hits started to bother me. Regulations, which were coming one after the other, were disturbing,"" said.""And then in 2018, I sought a meeting with the PM,"" he went on to add. ""I was still the chairman of GSMA… just coming out from the chairmanship of the International Chamber of Commerce, when I used to brief him (PM) occasionally on WTO, G20 and other issues. So, I took his permission to talk about the Indian telecom industry. I told him that things were very bad and the situation was getting very alarming. I said I will fight in the marketplace, but I can’t fight the government… we spoke in Hindi. He told me that this government will not tilt towards either side. Whatever is good for the country will be done. You fight in the marketplace... I don’t have a view on that. But you can be sure that the government will not take sides,"" Mittal said.He went on to add how the PM's words kind of assured him. That was enough for me. I got up and I thanked him, and said, “I will fight in the market”. This was the turning point.""Talking about Airtel's $100 billion market cap milestone, Mittal said, ""This $100-billion market cap is a testimony to what India is today, not just my company. Money is pouring into this country, a lot of capital is coming in, investments are coming in, the stock market is rising. These massive valuations are a function of a stable, solid, functional economy under a very solid leader.""","Bharti Airtel chairman Sunil Bharti Mittal spoke about his meeting with PM Narendra Modi.
