How a 27-year-old techie lost Rs 2 lakh while selling air cooler on OLX,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-a-27-year-old-techie-lost-rs-2-lakh-while-selling-air-cooler-on-olx/articleshow/113009321.cms,"How the scam happened

How to stay safe



A 27-year-old software engineer in Bengaluru has fallen victim to a QR code scam . Siddarth (name changed), a resident of Adugodi posted an advertisement to sell his air cooler online. The fraudster stole nearly Rs 1.9 lakh from the victim through a series of consecutive transactions.In a police complaint, Siddarth mentioned that he has put up an advertisement to sell his air cooler on the online marketplace OLX .He received a response within three minutes of posting the ad from a person who introduced himself as Srikanth Varma, a used furniture showroom owner in Whitefield.The caller agreed to buy the air cooler at the price quoted by Siddarth - Rs 5,200. Varma said that he will make the payment first and collect the item later by sending his staff or by courier. He said he would further communicate with Siddarth via his WhatsApp numbers (9864210921 & 9238924709).Consequently, he sent a QR code to Siddarth for Rs 5 and asked him to scan the code to receive the money. Scanning the code, Siddarth received Rs 5. Varma then sent him another QR code for Rs 5,200. This time, the money got debited from his own account, instead of receiving.Varma claimed it was because of a technical issue. He sent him another QR code for the same amount, which again got debited from Siddarth's account. Desperate to get his money back, Siddarth kept scanning QR codes and eventually lost Rs 1.9 lakh.It was now that he realized he had been scammed. When Varma asked him to send account details to add him as a beneficiary, Siddarth refused.He called his bank to block his account and registered a complaint with the Adugodi police.It is crucial to remember that one does not need to scan a QR code in order to receive money. A QR code is scanned only to send money. Further, it is advisable to practice caution and look for suspicious actions when transacting online.",A 27-year-old software engineer in Bengaluru has fallen victim to a QR code scam.

Cognizant new HQ to function from MEPZ campus

IT major Cognizant is selling its long-standing Indian headquarters in Chennai. The property, located on Chennai's IT Corridor in Okkiyam Thoraipakkam, includes a 15-acre land parcel and 400,000 square feet of office space. As per real estate industry estimates, the property could fetch around Rs 750 crore to Rs 800 crore to the company.The Thoraipakkam office has been Cognizant’s India headquarters for more than 20 years.It is where Cognizant co-founders – Lakshmi Narayanan and Chandrasekaran operated from. It is also the site of a landmark event where the company remotely rang the Nasdaq opening bell, marking a significant milestone in its growth. The campus also represents Cognizant's first fully owned property in Chennai, a step up from its previous rented space in the CSI building near the US ConsulateAccording to market sources, Cognizant plans to wind up the process and vacate the campus by December, 2024. Cognizant has mandated international property advisory JLL to sell the property. The advisory firm, according to sources, has been talking to many prospective buyers including local developers — Baashyaam Group and Casagrand. However, nothing has been finalised yet.Once the old headquarter building is sold and vacated, Cognizant’s new India headquarters may function from the MEPZ campus near Tambaram on GST Road.The move to sell the existing HQ building is seen as part of the company’s process to consolidate its operations in three of its own buildings at MEPZ, Sholinganallur and Siruseri. It has been giving up leased spaces across Chennai including prominent addresses at Ramanujan IT Park, DLF as well as St Mary’s Road offices in R A Puram.","Cognizant is selling its long-standing Indian headquarters in Chennai.

WazirX customers may not recover full funds after hack; here’s what the company’s legal advisor said,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/wazirx-customers-may-not-recover-full-funds-after-hack-heres-what-the-companys-legal-advisor-said/articleshow/113002706.cms,"What the legal advisor said



WazirX’s ongoing legal battles with other crypto platforms



A legal adviser working for WazirX has reportedly suggested that customers who were affected by the recent hacking incident on the cryptocurrency exchange are unlikely to recover their funds in full. During the ongoing restructuring process, George Gwee , a director at restructuring firm Kroll working with WazirX estimated that at least 43% of customer funds are lost.Last week, the domestic crypto platform sought a six-month protection period from the Singapore High Court to restructure its liabilities following the $234 million (nearly Rs 1963 crore) hack in July.In a press conference (reported by TechCrunch), Gwee said that at best “anywhere between 55% and 57% of the funds” can be recovered.For the restructuring, WazirX is mainly focusing on distributing the remaining token assets to users on a pro-rata basis through cryptocurrency.The company is also in talks to share profits from its revenue-generating products, but it did not provide specific details, the report added.WazirX’s hack was the largest cryptocurrency theft in the country’s history. Since the incident, the company has been trying to recover the stolen amount and even proposed to socialise the lost funds . However, despite efforts the company faces significant challenges.The crypto platform has been exploring various options, including potential capital injections from an unnamed investor. However, the ongoing dispute with world’s largest crypto platform Binance has complicated these efforts.In 2019, Binance announced that it had acquired WazirX, but later denied the acquisition. Following a public disagreement, the cryptocurrency exchange ended its tech support to the Indian firm in 2022.The company also recently faced legal action from CoinSwitch, another Indian crypto exchange, which sued WazirX last week to recover around $9.7 million worth of assets stuck on the latter platform.",A legal adviser working for WazirX has reportedly suggested that customers who were affected by the recent hacking incident are unlikely to recover their funds in full.

Why one of France’s biggest IT companies is cutting its revenue forecast,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-one-of-frances-biggest-it-companies-is-cutting-its-revenue-forecast/articleshow/112996869.cms,"Why Atos is reducing its revenue projections



How Atos is trying to avoid bankruptcy



French information technology (IT) company Atos is facing a turbulent period. The company has announced a revised financial outlook and has reduced its revenue forecast for 2024 and beyond. This news comes as Atos grapples with a weaker business environment and client contract delays.The downward revision sees Atos anticipating 9.7 billion euros ($10.72 billion) in revenue for 2024, down from the previously estimated 9.8 billion euros ($10.8 billion).The company also lowered its long-term targets, adjusting its 2027 revenue projection to 10.6 billion euros ($11.7 billion) from 11 billion euros ($12 billion). Despite these changes, Atos maintains its financial restructuring plan and expects to achieve positive cash flow by 2026.Once regarded as a leading player in Europe’s software and technology sector, Atos has been on the verge of financial collapse in recent months. However, the company secured an important restructuring agreement with banks and bondholders earlier this year.According to a Bloomberg report, Atos has lowered revenue projections for its big data and security business , which includes cybersecurity and supercomputers, “to align with current business momentum.” Meanwhile, the company’s legacy IT outsourcing unit , Tech Foundations, will be hit by “contract terminations or lower scope of work as well as future client activity expectations.”While reducing its forecast, the company confirmed that this decision wouldn’t impact the financial restructuring plan agreed upon by most creditors earlier this year, Atos said in a statement to Bloomberg.Despite being a significant supplier to the nuclear industry and the Olympic Games, Atos has been grappling with substantial financial challenges. Over the past seven years, the company has lost nearly €12 billion ($13.2 billion) in market value due to factors such as huge debts, accounting errors, and industry headwinds, the report suggests.To avoid bankruptcy , Atos has been undergoing a formal restructuring process involving creditors and banks since February. The restructuring plan, which is expected to dilute the value of existing shares, is expected to follow court approval.Atos recently reported a wider first-half operating loss, attributing it to impairment charges, reduced sales in the Americas, and a decline in public-sector orders in Europe. The company's restructuring plan includes several capital increases and debt issuances planned from November 2024 to January 2025. Atos confirmed that a court hearing to approve the safeguard plan is set for October 15.","French IT company Atos has reduced its revenue forecast for 2024 and beyond.

China warns Japan over potential new chip curbs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/china-warns-japan-over-potential-new-chip-curbs/articleshow/112994834.cms,"China is threatening Japan with ""severe economic retaliation"" if Tokyo further restricts sales and servicing of chip making equipment to Chinese firms, complicating US-led efforts to limit China's access to advanced technology, according to Bloomberg sources familiar with the matter.Senior Chinese officials have repeatedly conveyed this stance in recent meetings with their Japanese counterparts.A key concern for Japan is the potential impact on its automotive industry . Toyota Motor, ""among the most important companies in Japan,"" has privately expressed fears to Tokyo officials that ""Beijing could react to new semiconductor controls by cutting Japan's access to critical minerals that are essential for automotive production,"" Bloomberg reports.The US has been pressuring Japan to impose additional restrictions on firms like Tokyo Electron Ltd. from selling advanced chipmaking tools to China. A senior US administration official told Bloomberg they are ""confident that they can assuage Tokyo's concerns and reach an agreement with Japan by the end of this year.""However, more aggressive options are being considered. Bloomberg sources reveal that ""Behind the scenes, the US has been wielding a power known as the foreign direct product rule , or FDPR,"" which ""allows Washington to control sales of products made anywhere in the world, provided they use even the smallest amount of American technology.""The timing of any deal is complicated by the upcoming US presidential election and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's planned resignation. However, the senior US official stated that ""Kishida stepping down should not impact the negotiations for further curbs, because Tokyo has built consensus for the policy across its government.""Bloomberg reports that the US is also considering new curbs on "" high-bandwidth memory chips — an essential AI component — and additional chipmaking tools, as well as measures targeting specific Chinese companies."" This has triggered parallel negotiations with Japan and the Netherlands.US lawmakers are pressing for allied cooperation. Representatives Zoe Lofgren and Senator Alex Padilla wrote in an August 13 letter that they are ""deeply concerned about the harm being done to US companies and US leadership in semiconductor innovation by unilateral export controls with questionable national security benefits.""","China is threatening Japan with ""severe economic retaliation"" if Tokyo further restricts sales and servicing of chip making equipment to Chinese firms.

"The future of customer experience: Industry and academia pinpoints aligning Strategy, Technology, and Security in a Data-Driven World",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/the-future-of-customer-experience-industry-and-academia-pinpoints-aligning-strategy-technology-and-security-in-a-data-driven-world/articleshow/112994882.cms,"As companies increasingly embrace data-driven strategies to enhance customer experience (CX), they are encountering significant challenges. In an era where customer experience (CX) is a key differentiator for businesses, the shift towards data-driven strategies has become imperative. However, while the intent to harness data for enhancing CX is widespread, organizations often find themselves grappling with significant challenges.From fragmented datasets to misaligned organizational strategies, the journey to a seamless, data-driven customer experience is fraught with complexities. Amit Sanyal, EVP and COO – MarTech Solutions at Comviva emphasized the widespread intent among enterprises to adopt data-driven approaches but pointed out that ""the intent is limited by the ability."" He highlighted that one of the biggest challenges companies face is dealing with ""fragmented and siloed datasets.""While the data exists, it often isn't usable in a way that can lead to actionable insights. This has resulted in slow and rudimentary execution of data-driven initiatives, which are typically confined to small use cases. Sanyal further mentioned the disconnect between senior management's strategic intent and the execution at the ground level. ""While the top believes it's a strategic direction imperative for the organization to embrace, the execution machinery is still very IT driven,"" he explained. This underscores the need for organizational alignment , where AI or analytics-driven initiatives are viewed as business imperatives rather than just IT projects.Manas Agrawal, CEO & Co-Founder at Affine highlighted the need for a holistic approach, stating that data-driven transformation ""must be a business strategic decision."" He stressed the importance of having all key stakeholders—business, IT, analytics—seated at the same table, working towards a singular goal of transforming customer experience. Agrawal also pointed out the emerging challenge of leveraging user-generated content, such as emails and documents, through Generative AI (GenAI). ""Firms do not have the time to really twiddle their thumbs and take a long time to get on that bandwagon; they'll get left behind,"" he warned, emphasizing the need for timely adoption of new technologies.Shaveen Garg, MD & Partner at Boston Consulting Group (BCG) discussed the focus of companies on areas where they can see a clear return on investment (ROI). He noted that the strategic intent varies depending on the aspect of customer experience being targeted—whether it's ease of information finding during a purchase, customer engagement, or handling complaints. ""The factor the clients can put on getting an ROI on the growth or a customer retention and churn reduction is much higher than some of the hygiene factors today,"" Garg observed. He also highlighted the critical role of AI and analytics in proactive customer engagement, where the aim is to resolve issues before they escalate, thus reducing the need for customer-initiated interactions.Dr. Arnab Bhattacharya, Professor for Computer Science and Engineering at IIT Kanpur provided insights from the academic perspective, acknowledging that while the curriculum in computer science and data science is increasingly aligned with industry needs, there is still a gap. “We would not say it's a shortage of talent,” he says.“What you learn, when you graduate from the college, you are not considered industry-worthy right at that point. You have to be on the job for at least six months, one year. Now fortunately or unfortunately in computer science that's not the case. Industry expects a student to be working on a critical project on a critical mode from day one of the graduation.” Bhattacharya emphasized the importance of collaboration between academia and industry to provide students with real data and domain knowledge, which would better prepare them for the challenges they will face in the workforce. He noted that ""industry readiness is not just about technical skills but also understanding the real-world complexities of data, including how to navigate and integrate fragmented datasets effectively.""As companies digitize their processes, the importance of cybersecurity and ethical considerations cannot be overstated. Amit Sanyal noted that ""privacy and security have really taken center stage in the last about three, four years,"" but acknowledged that the field is still evolving.Manas Agrawal added that security and resilience should be integral to the design and architecture of data systems, rather than being treated as separate budget items. He emphasized the importance of having a ""human in the loop"" to handle contingencies and ensure the system's reliability. Shaveen Garg stressed that avoiding conversations about cybersecurity and privacy is not feasible. Instead, companies need to focus on mitigating these risks while also demonstrating the value of new technologies. ""The benefit and the cost equation is yet to be proven, and that's what we are trying to create at BCG—marquee accounts at scale where they have deployed it and have done it with the right investments,"" Garg explained.As businesses continue to navigate the complexities of data-driven customer experience, it becomes clear that the path to success is not just about adopting the latest technologies but about aligning organizational strategy, fostering cross-functional collaboration, and addressing ethical concerns such as privacy and cybersecurity. There is a need for a unified approach, where business, IT, and academia work in tandem to overcome challenges and unlock the full potential of data-driven CX. Ultimately, the companies that can navigate these challenges with agility and foresight will be the ones that set new benchmarks in customer experience, driving growth and innovation in the digital age.","In an era where customer experience (CX) is a key differentiator for businesses, the shift towards data-driven strategies has become imperative.

“$ is not just a currency symbol. It is embedded in many programming language syntaxes such as:

- We write variables under this ${} in javascript.

- Variables are also written like this $1, $2 in bash syntax.”

“Only a person who works on MS Excel knows the answer. $ is used to freeze a Row or column in Excel formulas and ₹ can't do that. That's why $ is used universally for that purpose . However, you can anytime use ₹ on your computer.”

"Why TRAI's ‘September 1 deadline’ for Airtel, Reliance Jio and Vodafone-Idea is ‘bad news’ for your OTPs",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-trais-september-1-deadline-for-airtel-reliance-jio-and-vodafone-idea-is-bad-news-for-your-otps/articleshow/112787423.cms,"What is the big change

What is Whitelisting or URLs

Similar disruption in 2021

Starting September 1, consumers might experience disruptions in receiving service and transactional messages from banks, financial institutions, and e-commerce firms on their mobile phones. This follows a directive from the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) aimed at reducing spam, particularly phishing attempts.Trai has instructed telecom companies to stop transmitting messages containing URLs, OTT links, APKs (Android application packages), or call-back numbers that are not whitelisted—registered with telcos—by senders from September 1.This directive means that banks, financial institutions, and online platforms must register their message templates and content with operators by August 31. If they fail to do so, messages containing these elements will be blocked.Currently, entities register their headers and templates with telcos but not the content of messages. This means operators do not check the content of transmitted messages. However, starting next month, telcos must create a mechanism to read the content of commercial messages and block those that do not match their records, according to experts.In India, 1.5-1.7 billion commercial messages are sent daily, totaling about 55 billion every month, according to industry data.Airtel, Reliance Jio and Vodafone-Idea want extension in deadlineAccording to a report in Economic Times, industry executives say the telecom sector is seeking more time from Trai to implement the mandate as the blockchain-based distributed ledger technology (DLT) platform needs updating. However, the regulator believes it has given sufficient time to the telcos and is unwilling to extend the deadline, according to officials familiar with the matter.Bharti Airtel, Reliance Jio, and Vodafone Idea did not respond to ET’s queries.Whitelisting requires entities sending messages to provide all information related to URLs, call-back numbers, etc., to telcos, who will then feed the information into their DLT platform. If the information matches, the message is passed; otherwise, it is blocked.For example, most transactional messages from banks, such as funds debit or credit, contain a call-back number. Transmission of such messages will be stopped if a bank does not whitelist the number.“Only those entities, including banks, which whitelist their URLs or content of the messages with telcos, will pass through; the rest will be blocked,” said a telecom industry executive.Mobile consumers faced a similar outage in March 2021 when the DLT platform was implemented, and telcos started scrubbing messages. At that time, there was widespread disruption as telcos blocked all commercial messages that did not contain whitelisted headers and templates. Following the disruption, all entities have since registered their headers and templates with telcos.Experts say that in the current scenario, an increasing number of messages may shift to over-the-top (OTT) platforms like WhatsApp and Google’s rich communication services (RCS) messaging, as there is no such mandate from Trai to govern them. However, banking messages, where rules do not permit transmission over OTT, will be blocked if the entities have not been whitelisted, the experts added.","Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) has instructed telecom companies to stop transmitting messages containing URLs, OTT links, APKs, or call-back numbers that are not whitelisted by senders.

Google kills Fitbit smartwatches; says smartwatch portfolio now is ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-kills-fitbit-smartwatches-says-smartwatch-portfolio-now-is-/articleshow/112651343.cms,"Fitbit as a smartwatch brand is effectively over. No surprises, as many would say. The writing has been there on the wall for sometime now. Google acquired Fitbit in 2021, since then there were speculations about the future of the brand. While since 2021, Google launched three Pixel series smartwatches, including the Pixel Watch 3 at the recent 'Made for Google' event, there have been two Fitbit smartwatches -- Versa 4 and Sense 2.The Fitbit Versa 4 and Sense 2 were launched just months before Google’s first Pixel Watch.Google has now confirmed that Fitbit as a brand will no longer be making new smartwatches and that the Pixel Watch series will be taking over going forward. Speaking to Engadget, Google’s director of product management for Pixel wearables, Sandeep Waraich, said, “Pixel Watch is our smartwatch part of the portfolio”. Waraich said the same in response to a question about the future of the Fitbit-branded smartwatches, adding that Pixel Watch is “our next iteration of smartwatch for Fitbit.”But while you may not get Fitbit smartwatches, Fitbit brand per se is not being killed. Google will continue to make Fitbit fitness bands . Fitbit-branded products will focus on trackers that are “more minimalistic” with long battery life, said Waraich.As to what happens to Fitbit smartwatch customers . Google said, ""We are very committed to Fitbit, and even more importantly to the customers that use and depend on those products and technology. It's also worth noting that many of the health and fitness features we launched in Pixel Watch 3 were because of Fitbit's innovation and ground-breaking fitness advancements. In addition, we just launched Fitbit Ace LTE , and you’ll continue to see new products and innovation from Fitbit.""This means that Google will continue to provide software updates, and even new features to both devices.As for Pixel Watch fans, Google has launched Pixel Watch 3 in India, starting at RS 39,99. Pixel Watch 3 will go on sale in the country in September.","Google acquired Fitbit in 2021, since then there were speculations about the future of the brand.
