Anil Kapoor: How this 'court case' resulted in Anil Kapoor making it to Time’s list of most Influential people in AI,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-this-court-case-resulted-in-anil-kapoor-making-it-to-times-list-of-most-influential-people-in-ai/articleshow/113154447.cms,"Why Anil Kapoor featured in the Time Magazine’s AI 2024 list

Implications of Anil Kapoor’s victory



When Hollywood actors had a problem with AI

Time Magazine ’s 2024 list of most Influential people in AI had a surprise inclusion this year. Among prominent names like Google’s Sundra Pichai, Nvidia’s Jensen Huang, OpenAI’s Sam Altman, the list featured bollywood actor Anil Kapoor that came as a surprise to many. So much so that it has got the internet talking and wondering how Anil Kapoor made it to TIME magazine’s AI cover.If you are also curious to know the reason behind Kapoor’s inclusion in the list, then read on.Back in 2023, Kapoor filed a case with the Delhi High Court seeking protection of his own name, image, likeness, persona, voice and various other attributes of his personality against misuse of all hues over the internet. Delivered by Justice Prathiba M Singh, the high court passed an interim order then, restraining the misuse of the actor's name, image, voice and other attributes of persona, including his popular ‘jhakaas’ catchphrase.Reacting to the order, Kapoor then told Variety, “I’m very happy with this court order, which has come in my favor, and I think it’s very progressive and great for not only me but for other actors also.”“Because of the way technology and the AI technology, which is which is evolving every day [and] which can completely take advantage of and be misused commercially, as well as where my image, voice, morphing, GIFs and deep fakes are concerned, I can straight away, if that happens, send a court order and injunction and they have to pull it down,” he said.“Around the same time that SAG-AFTRA members were fighting big Hollywood studios over the use of their AI replicas without consent and compensation, one of India’s most famous actors was fighting a similar battle. Anil Kapoor won a landmark victory in a New Delhi high court in September over unauthorized AI use of his likeness,” says Time Magazine.Anil Kapoor knocked the court’s door when deepfake videos of popular Indian actors including Alia Bhatt, Rashmika Mandanna, Aamir Khan and Ranveer Singh alarmed the country. Kapoor’s victory has also paved the way for others to seek protection over their personality rights .In July this year, the Bombay High Court granted interim relief to singer Arijit Singh, noting that using his voice without permission was a legal violation. The case was heard after unauthorized AI platforms mimicked Singh’s name and likeness without consent, with one platform even using text-to-speech software to convert text into his voice.In 2023, the Screen Actors Guild – American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) demanded to limit the use of AI. The union then sought to ensure actors are informed if artificial intelligence systems were replicating their voices or performances.“It is with profound disappointment that we report the industry CEOs have walked away from the bargaining table after refusing to counter our latest offer,” SAG-AFTRA said in a statement. “These companies refuse to protect performers from being replaced by AI, they refuse to increase your wages to keep up with inflation, and they refuse to share a tiny portion of the immense revenue YOUR work generates for them,” the actors’ guild added.","Time Magazine’s 2024 list of most Influential people in AI had a surprise inclusion this year.

Open Google Photos: Launch the Google Photos app on your Android or iOS device. Tap the search bar: You'll find it at the top of the screen. Enter your search term: Type in a keyword or phrase related to the photos you're looking for. For example, you could search for ""dog,"" ""beach,"" or ""2023."" Refine your search: If you're not getting the desired results, try using more specific keywords or combining them with filters.

Tips for effective classic search:

Use relevant keywords: The more specific your keywords, the more accurate your search results will be.

Combine keywords: Use AND, OR, and NOT to combine keywords and refine your search. For example, ""dog AND beach"" will find photos of dogs at the beach.

Utilise filters: Google Photos offers various filters to help you narrow down your search. You can filter by date, people, places, and more.

Google Photos Classic Search is a powerful tool that allows you to quickly and easily find specific photos and videos within your library.

GPT-Next created to help humans

ChatGPT-maker OpenAI may be ready to take a leap towards AI dominance with its next AI language model. According to OpenAI Japan CEO Tadao Nagasaki, the next version of ChatGPT is projected to be 100 times more powerful than its predecessor, GPT-4, which currently powers the AI chatbot.As per reports, the model will use a smaller version of OpenAI’s alleged Project Strawberry that was purportedly teased by company CEO Sam Altman last month by means of a photograph of strawberries.Project Strawberry, which is also known as Project Q* (or Q-star) is reportedly a secretive project, which aims to achieve Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).In a gathering at the KDDI Summit 2024, Nagasaki said that the AI model may be called GPT-Next without giving a launch timeline. He said that the new AI model will be announced in the future. It will have a significant advancement in AI capabilities such as improved problem-solving, communication, and insights across various sectors, the CEO added.As per reports, the powerful performance of GPT-Next is due to better architecture and not huge computing resources. GPT-Next's may also have an impact in sectors like healthcare, finance, media and manufacturing. It's poised to accelerate drug discovery, personalise medical treatments, and even transform content creation.As per Nagasaki, the GPT-Next is designed to augment human intelligence, enabling individuals to work more efficiently and creatively.Recently, the company announced that by the end of August, ChatGPT had surpassed 200 million active users – making it the fastest software to reach that milestone.

Canva explains increasing prices of its AI feature plans by up to 300%,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/canva-explains-increasing-prices-of-its-ai-feature-plans-by-up-to-300/articleshow/113157418.cms,"Take a look at the post here

Rise in Canva Teams plan prices in some markets



What the company said



Canva recently announced major price hikes for Canva Teams customers. Some markets, like the US, saw team plan prices increase by up to 300%. The popular design platform has claimed that the cost of generative AI is a contributing factor to this price hike . However, some users have criticised the hike to be excessive. Here are the new prices of Canva Teams plans in some markets.In a post on social media platform X, a user named Will Sanders shared the new prices and wrote: “Canva price increase is one of the biggest increases I have ever seen YoY.”In the US, the annual cost for a Canva Teams plan for five users has increased by nearly 316% from $119.99 to $500 (with a 40% discount for the first year).This discount will also apply to new members that will be added in that period.Meanwhile, in Australia, the company increased monthly fees for five-member plans which used to cost 39.99 AUD to $13.50 AUS per user, which is almost a 70% increase (considering getting the plan for five members from the previous price. It's important to note the plan now charges $13.50 per user per month, with a three-user minimum.Canva Teams plans now cost $100 per person annually or $10 monthly and at least three users are required for a Teams plan. These new rates, previously introduced for new customers, are now being applied to existing subscribers with older pricing plans. However, these changes will not affect Canva’s Pro or Enterprise tiers.In a statement to TechCrunch, a Canva spokesperson confirmed the recent price increases and attributed them to the company's growing suite of generative AI tools, such as Magic Studio .“Our original pricing reflected the early stage of this product and has remained unchanged for the last four years. We’re now updating the price for customers on this older plan to reflect our expanded product experience,” the spokesperson said.The spokesperson noted that some Canva customers were benefiting from lower pricing plans that are no longer available. Its also important to note that Canva adjusted its Teams pricing to $10 per month per user earlier this year.","Canva recently announced major price hikes for Canva Teams customers.

Click here to read more Intel is cancelling the development of its 20A process node, which was expected to be used for the production of upcoming Arrow Lake processors. Instead it plans to go with external manufacturers to produce the chips externally. Intel will now rely on outside foundries, likely TSMC, to produce all Arrow Lake components while Intel will handle final packaging.The cancellation of 20A is particularly notable as Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger had positioned it as the start of the company's ""Angstrom era"" when first announced in 2021. Now, the shift to external manufacturing for Arrow Lake is a significant departure from those plans, but it aligns with the company’s recent cost-cutting measures announced following concerning financial results last quarter. The company is undergoing major restructuring, including laying off 15,000 workers, amid financial challenges.Intel first demonstrated the Arrow Lake chips on 20A wafers at its Innovation 2023 event. At the time, Intel targeted a 2024 release for Arrow Lake.Intel CFO Dave Zinsner said the company would ""skip over productizing"" the 20A node to reduce capital expenditures. Resources previously allocated to 20A development will now be directed toward the more advanced 18A node, slated for 2025 launch. The company projects the change will save $500 million by avoiding costs associated with ramping up 20A production.

Pavel Durov, CEO of Telegram , has recently become the subject of widespread speculation after older photos of him resurfaced online. These images have led many to wonder whether the billionaire entrepreneur underwent plastic surgery to enhance his appearance. Adding to the intrigue, Durov was recently arrested in France, raising further questions about the man behind the popular messaging app.Pavel Durov, a 39-year-old entrepreneur originally from Russia, is best known as the founder and CEO of Telegram, a messaging app launched in 2013.Telegram quickly gained popularity for its strong emphasis on user privacy, offering end-to-end encryption and other security features that set it apart from competitors. As of now, Forbes estimates Durov's net worth to be around $15.5 billion. Despite his success in the tech industry, Durov has managed to maintain a relatively low profile—until now.Durov's recent arrest in Paris has added a new layer of complexity to his public image. He was detained in France on charges of suspected complicity in running an online platform involved in illicit activities, including child exploitation, drug trafficking, and fraud. While these allegations are serious, it is the sudden focus on Durov's physical transformation that has captured the internet's attention.Pavel Durov has been active on social media platforms like Instagram since 2011, regularly sharing photos from his travels around the world. In his recent posts, Durov appears with a full head of hair and a toned physique, often posing shirtless in various locations. However, these recent images stand in stark contrast to older photos where Durov was seen with a noticeably receding hairline.The drastic change in his appearance has fueled rumours that Durov may have undergone plastic surgery, including a possible hair transplant. A popular post on X (formerly Twitter) by a well-known account shared a side-by-side comparison of Durov's old and new photos, sparking a flurry of online discussions. The post reads, ""Pavel Durov (Telegram CEO) before his hair transplant and plastic surgery,"" and has since gone viral.The speculation around Durov's transformation has been met with a variety of opinions online. On Reddit, users have debated whether the changes in Durov's appearance are the result of surgical procedures or simply better grooming and styling.One Reddit user commented, ""This isn't a hair transplant. His hair is too thick and full to have this kind of drastic change from a HT. Most likely he's wearing a hair system (wig).""Another user added, ""There's speculation that it's not a transplant, but rather a hair system because his hair loss was much more advanced in the first picture, so when the operation happens, the resulting hairdo never looks as full as his.""Some users believe the changes are the result of plastic surgery, with one theorising, ""This is well-done surgery.""However, not everyone is convinced that surgery is involved. One Reddit user opined, ""Honestly, I think a lot of the facial 'changes' are simply due to the much better angle and lighting in the second photo.""As the speculation continues, it's clear that Durov's transformation—whether natural or assisted—has caught the public's eye. The intense scrutiny of his appearance highlights the challenges that come with being in the spotlight, especially for someone as private as Durov. Whether or not he has undergone any procedures, the discussions around his looks reflect a broader societal fascination with image and success.","Pavel Durov, 39, is the founder and CEO of Telegram, a messaging app launched in 2013.

In a 2009 interview with American journalist Charlie Rose , Musk praised Ratan Tata as a ""gentleman and a scholar."" This moment has recently resurfaced, shedding light on Musk's appreciation for Ratan Tata and his ambitious project, the Tata Nano .The Tata Nano was introduced by Tata Motors in 2008 as the world's cheapest car, with a price tag of just Rs 1 lakh (approximately $2,300 at the time). The car was a pet project of Ratan Tata, designed to make automobile ownership accessible to millions of Indians who had never been able to afford a car. The idea was revolutionary—a small, affordable car that would cater to the vast Indian middle class, providing them with a safe and efficient means of transportation.In the interview with Charlie Rose, which took place shortly after the launch of the Tata Nano, the Tesla CEO was asked about his views on Ratan Tata’s efforts to introduce a low-cost car in India. The interview clip, which has recently gone viral, captures Musk's candid response.""Take for a moment Ratan Tata, what he’s doing in India — developing a little sedan for $2300. Where do you put that in the whole equation of where the future of cars is?"" asked Rose.Musk responded with a mix of admiration and caution. He began by acknowledging the brilliance behind the Tata Nano project and the character of Ratan Tata himself.""I think it's a good idea to have affordable cars, but I think the problem with something like the Nano ... I wouldn't say problem because I think, by the way, it is probably a great idea and Ratan is a gentleman and scholar,"" Musk said.However, Musk also expressed his concerns about the long-term viability of such a low-cost vehicle, particularly in the context of rising fuel prices. He pointed out that while the initial purchase cost of the Nano was remarkably low, the cost of running the car—particularly fuel costs—could become a significant issue as gasoline prices continued to rise.""But where it’s going to become challenging in the future is when the price of gasoline rises, the cost of acquiring the car is much less of an issue than the cost of running the car,"" the billionnaire explained.Despite the initial excitement surrounding the Tata Nano, the car faced numerous challenges. One of the most significant issues was its branding. While the Nano was intended to be an affordable vehicle for the masses, it was often labeled as ""cheap"" rather than ""affordable."" This perception problem, combined with safety concerns and competition from other small cars, led to unimpressive sales figures.The Nano’s production was ultimately discontinued in 2018, marking the end of what was initially seen as a groundbreaking project. The car's journey from inception to discontinuation is often cited as one of the biggest marketing failures in the automobile industry.","The Tata Nano was introduced by Tata Motors in 2008 as the world's cheapest car, with a price tag of just Rs 1 lakh (approximately $2,300 at the time) The car was a pet project of Ratan Tata, designed to make automobile ownership accessible to millions of Indians who had never been able to afford a car.
