Government has a warning for SBI customers on this 'alert message' from the bank,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/government-has-a-warning-for-sbi-customers-on-this-alert-message-from-the-bank/articleshow/112237145.cms,"What is the message

Here are some tips to protect yourself from

SMS fraud

:

Avoid clicking links or providing personal information to numbers you don't recognise.

Legitimate businesses rarely demand immediate action via SMS.

Hover over links without clicking to check the actual URL. Avoid clicking if it looks unfamiliar or misspelled.

Avoid sharing passwords, credit card numbers, or personal details via SMS

Enable two-factor authentication: This adds an extra layer of security to your accounts

Be cautious with free Wi-Fi. Public Wi-Fi networks can be less secure, making it easier for hackers to intercept information.

Ensure your phone's operating system and apps are up-to-date with the latest security patches

If you receive a suspicious text, report it immediately

Remarkably, he remains unmarried.Durov’s journey as a sperm donor began 15 years ago when a close friend approached him with a heartfelt request. The friend and his wife were struggling with fertility issues, and they asked Durov to donate sperm at a clinic.Initially amused by the idea, Durov soon realized the seriousness of the situation and agreed to help.Doctors emphasized the scarcity of high-quality donor material, prompting Durov to view sperm donation as his civic duty. His contributions have enabled around a hundred couples across 12 countries to conceive children. Even today, one IVF clinic retains his frozen sperm for anonymous use by families seeking to expand.Despite acknowledging the risks involved, Durov has no regrets about his altruistic act. He believes he played a role in addressing the global shortage of healthy sperm.Tesla CEO Elon Musk , himself father of 12 children, playfully responded to Durov’s revelation. On X (formerly Twitter), Musk quipped that having 100 biological children was “rookie numbers,” humorously attributing the quote to Genghis Khan—an 11th-century Mongol ruler estimated to have had hundreds, if not thousands, of biological offspring.Musk himself has fathered 12 children with three different women and recently welcomed a new baby with Neuralink executive Shivon Zilis.","Telegram co-founder Pavel Durov has fathered over 100 biological children.

Google 's parent company, Alphabet , has significantly reduced its stake in cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, according to a recent regulatory filing. The move comes amidst a firestorm of controversy surrounding a global tech outage triggered by a CrowdStrike software update last month.Alphabet's holdings in CrowdStrike dropped from 855,789 Class A shares to 427,895 as of June 30th, representing a substantial decrease in its investment.This decision was made prior to the July 19th outage that disrupted operations across industries, including healthcare, banking, and aviation.The widespread disruption caused by the CrowdStrike incident has led to a dramatic decline in the company's stock price, with shares plummeting by nearly 35%. Investors are reevaluating their reliance on single-source cybersecurity solutions, and regulatory scrutiny is intensifying over the safety of such critical software.Adding to CrowdStrike's troubles, a class-action lawsuit was filed against the company this week accusing it of misleading investors about the reliability of its software. Furthermore, Delta Airlines has claimed that the outage cost the company a staggering $500 million, and it is pursuing legal action against both Microsoft and CrowdStrike for damages.As the fallout from the outage continues to unfold, the cybersecurity industry is facing unprecedented challenges. The incident has raised serious questions about the resilience of critical infrastructure and the potential risks associated with overreliance on a single vendor.","Alphabet's holdings in CrowdStrike dropped from 855,789 Class A shares to 427,895 as of June 30th.

"Intel to layoff over 15,000 employees: Read the memo shared by company’s CEO",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/intel-to-layoff-over-15000-employees-read-the-memo-shared-by-companys-ceo/articleshow/112211785.cms,"Here’s the full text of the memo shared by Intel CEO

Team,

We have moved our All Company Meeting to today, following our earnings call, as we are announcing significant actions to reduce our costs. We plan to deliver $10 billion in

cost savings

in 2025, and this includes reducing our head count by roughly 15,000 roles, or 15% of our workforce. The majority of these actions will be completed by the end of this year.

This is painful news for me to share. I know it will be even more difficult for you to read. This is an incredibly hard day for Intel as we are making some of the most consequential changes in our company’s history. When we meet in a few hours, I’ll talk about why we’re doing this and what you can expect in the coming weeks. In advance of that, I wanted to preview some of what’s on my mind.

Simply put, we must align our cost structure with our new operating model and fundamentally change the way we operate. Our revenues have not grown as expected – and we’ve yet to fully benefit from powerful trends, like AI. Our costs are too high, our margins are too low. We need bolder actions to address both – particularly given our financial results and outlook for the second half of 2024, which is tougher than previously expected.

These decisions have challenged me to my core, and this is the hardest thing I’ve done in my career. My pledge to you is that we will prioritize a culture of honesty, transparency and respect in the weeks and months to come.

Next week, we’ll announce a companywide enhanced retirement offering for eligible employees and broadly offer an application program for voluntary departures. I believe that how we implement these changes is just as important as the changes themselves, and we will adhere to Intel values throughout this process.

Why Now?

Since introducing our new operating model, we have taken a clean-sheet view of the business and assessed ourselves against benchmarks for high-performing foundries, fabless product companies and corporate functions. This work made it clear our cost structure is not competitive.

For example, our annual revenue in 2020 was about $24 billion higher than it was last year, yet our current workforce is actually 10% larger now than it was then. There are a lot of reasons for this, but it’s not a sustainable path forward.

Beyond our costs, we need to change the way we operate – something many of you shared as part of our Employee Experience Survey. There’s too much complexity, so we need to both automate and simplify processes. It takes too long for decisions to be made, so we need to eliminate bureaucracy. And there’s too much inefficiency in the system, so we need to expedite workflows.

Key Priorities

The actions we are taking will make Intel a leaner, simpler and more agile company. Let me highlight our areas of focus:

Reducing Operational Costs: We will drive companywide operational and cost efficiencies, including the cost savings and head count reductions mentioned above.

Simplifying Our Portfolio: We will complete actions this month to simplify our businesses. Each business unit is conducting a portfolio review and identifying underperforming products. We are also integrating key software assets into our business units so we accelerate our shift to systems-based solutions. And we will narrow our incubation focus on fewer, more impactful projects.

Eliminating Complexity: We will reduce layers, eliminate overlapping areas of responsibility, stop non-essential work, and foster a culture of greater ownership and accountability. For example, we will consolidate Customer Success into the Sales, Marketing and Communications Group to streamline our go-to-market motions.

Reducing Capital and Other Costs: With the completion of our historic five-nodes-in-four-years roadmap clearly in sight, we will review all active projects and equipment so we begin to shift our focus toward capital efficiency and more normalized spending levels. This will reduce our 2024 capital expenditures by more than 20%, and we plan to reduce our non-variable cost of goods sold by roughly $1 billion in 2025.

Suspending Our Dividend: We will suspend our stock dividend beginning next quarter to prioritize investments in the business and drive more sustained profitability.

Maintaining Growth Investments: Our IDM2.0 strategy is unchanged. Having fought hard to reestablish our innovation engine, we will maintain the key investments in our process technology and core product leadership.

The Future

I have no illusions that the path in front of us will be easy. You shouldn’t either. This is a tough day for all of us and there will be more tough days ahead. But as difficult as all of this is, we are making the changes necessary to build on our progress and usher in a new era of growth.

When we began this journey, we set our sights high, knowing that Intel is a place where big ideas are born and the power of what’s possible triumphs over the status quo. After all, our mission is to create world-changing technologies that improve the lives of every person on the planet. And at our best, we have exemplified these ideals more than any company in the world.

To live up to this mission, we must continue to drive our IDM 2.0 strategy, which remains the same: re-establish process technology leadership; invest in at-scale, globally resilient supply chain by expanding manufacturing capacity in the U.S. and EU; become a world-class, leading-edge foundry for internal and external customers; rebuild product portfolio leadership; and deliver AI Everywhere.

Over the past few years, we have rebuilt a sustainable innovation engine that is largely in place and on track. It’s now time to focus on building the sustainable financial engine needed to drive our performance. We must improve our execution, adapt to new market realities and operate as a more agile company. That’s the spirit of the actions we are taking – knowing that the choices we make today, as difficult as they are, will strengthen our ability to serve our customers and grow our business for years to come.

As we take these next steps in our journey, let’s not forget that there has never been a greater need for what we do. The world will increasingly run on silicon – and the world needs a healthy and vibrant Intel. That’s why the work we are doing is so consequential. Not only are we remaking a great company, but we are also creating technology and manufacturing capabilities that will reshape the world for decades to come. And this is something we should never lose sight of as we push forward in pursuit of our goals.

We’ll talk more in a few hours. Please come with your questions so we can have an open and honest discussion about what comes next.

Intel has announced to reduce its head count by more than 15% of its workforce, some 15,000 people, to reduce costs. “Our costs are too high, our margins are too low,” the company’s CEO Pat Gelsinger said in an internal memo sent to Intel employees on Thursday. In the letter, Gelsinger also said that the software giant will also announce a companywide enhanced retirement offering for eligible employees and broadly offer an application program for voluntary departures next week.","CEO: We plan to deliver $10 billion in cost savings by 2025.

NEW DELHI: A ransomware attack has forced the temporary shutdown of payment systems across nearly 300 small Indian local banks, according to reports. The customers of these banks have not been able to access payments services like withdrawing cash at ATMs or using United Payments Interface (UPI).The ransomware attack affected C-Edge Technologies , a provider of banking technology systems to small banks across the country, reports said.Other banking services are functioning normally, the officials told PTI.In a statement released late in the evening, the national payments corporation of India (NPCI) said, ""C-Edge Technologies….has been possibly impacted by a ransomware attack impacting a few of their systems,"" leading to the temporary isolation of C-Edge from accessing NPCI-operated retail payment systems.Dileep Sanghani, chairman of the national cooperative union of India, told news agency PTI that nearly 300 banks in India, including 17 district cooperative banks in Gujarat, which rely on C-Edge, have been facing issues for the past two to three days.""All online transactions, such as RTGS and UPI payments, are affected. Money is deducted from the sender's account but does not get credited in the receiver's account,"" Sanghani said.""Customers of banks serviced by C-Edge will not be able to access payment systems during the period of isolation,"" the NPCI told news agency Reuters.The statement also mentioned that restoration work is being carried out rapidly in collaboration with C-Edge Technologies, and a mandatory security review is underway.C-Edge, a joint venture between SBI and TCS, serves cooperative banks and regional rural banks, which have been affected by the breach. Officials stated that other banking services remained unaffected.

30% of Gen-AI projects will be 'dumped' by the end of 2025 due to these reasons: Gartner,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/30-of-gen-ai-projects-will-be-dumped-by-the-end-of-2025-due-to-these-reasons-gartner/articleshow/112170259.cms,"What early adopters say

Calculating business impact

At least 30% of generative artificial intelligence ( GenAI ) projects will be abandoned after proof of concept by the end of 2025, due to poor data quality, inadequate risk controls, escalating costs or unclear business value, according to research company Gartner , Inc.Speaking at the Gartner Data & Analytics Summit in Sydney this week, Rita Sallam, distinguished VP analyst at Gartner said, “After last year's hype, executives are impatient to see returns on GenAI investments, yet organizations are struggling to prove and realize value.As the scope of initiatives widen, the financial burden of developing and deploying GenAI models is increasingly felt.”A major challenge for organizations arises in justifying the substantial investment in GenAI for productivity enhancement, which can be difficult to directly translate into financial benefit, according to Gartner. Many organizations are leveraging GenAI to transform their business models and create new business opportunities. However, these deployment approaches come with significant costs, ranging from $5 million to $20 million.“Unfortunately, there is no one size fits all with GenAI, and costs aren’t as predictable as other technologies,” said Sallam. “What you spend, the use cases you invest in and the deployment approaches you take, all determine the costs. Whether you’re a market disruptor and want to infuse AI everywhere, or you have a more conservative focus on productivity gains or extending existing processes, each has different levels of cost, risk, variability and strategic impact.”Regardless of AI ambition, Gartner research indicates GenAI requires a higher tolerance for indirect, future financial investment criteria versus immediate return on investment (ROI). Historically, many CFOs have not been comfortable with investing today for indirect value in the future. This reluctance can skew investment allocation to tactical versus strategic outcomes.Earlier adopters across industries and business processes are reporting a range of business improvements that vary by use case, job type and skill level of the worker. According to a recent Gartner survey, respondents reported 15.8% revenue increase, 15.2% cost savings and 22.6% productivity improvement on average. The survey of 822 business leaders was conducted between September and November 2023.“This data serves as a valuable reference point for assessing the business value derived from GenAI business model innovation,” said Sallam. “But it’s important to acknowledge the challenges in estimating that value, as benefits are very company, use case, role and workforce specific. Often, the impact may not be immediately evident and may materialize over time. However, this delay doesn’t diminish the potential benefits.”By analyzing the business value and the total costs of GenAI business model innovation, organizations can establish the direct ROI and future value impact, according to Gartner. This serves as a crucial tool for making informed investment decisions about GenAI business model innovation.“If the business outcomes meet or exceed expectations, it presents an opportunity to expand investments by scaling GenAI innovation and usage across a broader user base, or implementing it in additional business divisions,” said Sallam. “However, if they fall short, it may be necessary to explore alternative innovation scenarios. These insights help organizations strategically allocate resources and determine the most effective path forward.”","At least 30% of generative artificial intelligence projects will be abandoned after proof of concept by the end of 2025, according to research company Gartner.

This guide outlines the crucial steps to follow if you lose money via UPI, credit/debit cards, or ATM scams , helping you secure your finances and increase the chances of recovery.As soon as you detect any unauthorised transaction, contact your bank or card issuer immediately. Most financial institutions have dedicated helplines for reporting fraud. Time is critical in these situations; the sooner you report, the better the chances of freezing the fraudulent transaction. Provide all necessary details, including the transaction amount, time, and any relevant information that can assist in the investigation.To prevent further unauthorised transactions, request your bank to block your card or freeze your UPI account. This step is vital in minimising the potential damage to your finances. Most banks offer this service through their customer service numbers or mobile apps. Additionally, changing your online banking passwords and securing your accounts is advisable.Visit your bank's nearest branch or use their online complaint system to file a detailed report about the fraud.

You can submit a complaint online via the National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal at cybercrime.gov.in. Provide comprehensive details and any evidence you have to support your claim. Cybercrime cells are equipped to handle such cases and can coordinate with banks and other institutions to track the fraudsters.If the amount lost is substantial, filing a First Information Report (FIR) at your local police station is necessary. This legal step initiates a formal investigation, which is often required for any reimbursement claims from your bank. Make sure to include all required documents and detailed information about the scam.Stay in constant contact with your bank during the investigation. Banks usually require up to 10 business days to investigate fraud cases. Keeping a record of all communications and following up regularly can expedite the process and ensure your case is prioritised.Banks and payment platforms have dispute resolution mechanisms in place.
