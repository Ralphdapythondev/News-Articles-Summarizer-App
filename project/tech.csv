Airtel, Vodafone-Idea and Reliance Jio to now send daily warnings

The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India ( TRAI ) has reportedly granted a one-month extension to December 1st for telecommunications operators to implement a new traceability mandate for commercial messages, including one-time passwords ( OTPs ). This move is aimed at combating spam and phishing activities. As per the revised deadline, messages not conforming to the traceability mandate will be blocked from December 1, as against the earlier deadline of November 1.Telecom operators -- Airtel , Vodafone-Idea and Reliance Jio -- had expressed concerns about the potential disruptions of blocking messages that don't adhere to the traceability rules, as many telemarketers and businesses, including banks, may not be fully prepared.To mitigate these concerns, TRAI has allowed a gradual implementation process. From now until November 30th, operators will issue daily warnings to entities that fail to comply with chain declaration requirements. Starting December 1st, messages from non-compliant entities will be blocked.This is the second extension granted by TRAI to the industry. Earlier, the deadline for whitelisting messages with URLs and OTT links was extended to October 1st.TRAI's efforts to curb spam and enhance security in the telecom sector include blacklisting entities, disconnecting mobile numbers, and migrating telemarketing calls to a blockchain-based platform for stricter monitoring.","Airtel, Vodafone-Idea and Reliance Jio to now send daily warnings to non- compliant entities.

Reliance enters in partnership with Nvidia

The 2024 Nvidia AI Summit in Mumbai saw Bollywood superstar Akshay Kumar rubbing shoulders with Jensen Huang , CEO of AI giant Nvidia. While the summit focused on strengthening India's AI capabilities, their encounter ended with a surprising discussion – martial arts.Kumar, a known martial arts enthusiast, shared a photo on social media X, formerly known as Twitter, where he and Huang pose playfully in a fighting stance. The caption reads: ""Imagine meeting the world’s biggest authority on Artificial Intelligence and ending up chatting about martial arts!! What an amazing man you are Mr. #JensenHuang. Now I know why @nvidia is the absolute giant that it is. 😊👍🏻""Nvidia's leather-jacket-clad CEO Huang got a rock star welcome at the company's AI summit in India. As a Bloomberg report said, ""The reception Huang received in India's commercial capital Mumbai was reminiscent of the ""Jensanity"" seen in other parts of the world, especially Taiwan, as his popularity climbs with Nvidia's soaring earnings and multi-trillion dollar market valuation.""Huang praised India's rapid digitalisation and its potential in the AI sector. ""Very few countries have this amazing natural resource called IT and computer science expertise,"" he said.The event, where the U.S. company unveiled plans to supply Reliance Industries and other Indian firms with its AI chips, had to be reportedly delayed for more than half an hour due to the crowd that one Nvidia employee said was ""easily a few thousand"".Nvidia CEO Huang and Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani announced a strategic partnership to build state-of-the-art AI infrastructure in India at the summit. The collaboration aims to accelerate India's transformation into a global AI powerhouse by leveraging the nation's vast talent pool and burgeoning digital infrastructure. ""We are among the only countries where the average age of 1.4 billion people is below 35,"" he noted. Ambani emphasised that India's aspirations, combined with the visionary leadership of the Indian Prime Minister, have set the stage for a digital revolution. ""We are at the doorstep of the new intelligence age,"" he said.","Jensen Huang, CEO of AI giant Nvidia, met Bollywood superstar Akshay Kumar at the 2024 Nvidia AI Summit in Mumbai.

Industrial conglomerate Siemens AG is reportedly exploring a potential acquisition of Altair Engineering Inc, a leading provider of engineering software . According to a report in Bloomberg, quoting sources familiar with the matter, this move, if finalized, would mark one of Siemens' largest acquisitions to date.The report said that Siemens has been actively working with advisors to assess the feasibility of acquiring Altair, which is headquartered in Troy, Michigan. Altair's stock has seen a significant surge of 27% this year, valuing the company at approximately $9.1 billion. The company has been considering a sale, and Reuters recently reported that Altair was exploring such a move.While discussions are ongoing, there's no guarantee that Siemens will ultimately decide to proceed with the acquisition. Other potential bidders could also emerge for Altair. Representatives from both companies have declined to comment on the matter.Founded by James Scapa, Altair offers a wide range of engineering software solutions to companies across various industries, including aerospace, automotive, energy, and financial services. The growing demand for such tools, driven by the increasing adoption of artificial intelligence, makes Altair a particularly attractive target for Siemens.Under the leadership of CEO Roland Busch , Siemens has been strategically shifting its focus away from heavy equipment businesses and towards higher-margin, software-driven product lines. This strategic shift aligns with the company's aim to catch up to its competitors in the automation industry, such as Rockwell Automation and Schneider Electric.The potential acquisition of Altair would further strengthen Siemens' position in the software market and enhance its capabilities in providing comprehensive engineering solutions to its customers.","Siemens AG is reportedly exploring a potential acquisition of Altair Engineering Inc.

Why the big China ban

What are the exceptions to the rule

The Biden administration announced on Monday that it is finalizing rules to restrict U.S. investments in artificial intelligence and other technology sectors in China that could pose a threat to U.S. national security . According to a report by news agency Reuters, these rules, proposed by the U.S. Treasury in June, stem from an executive order signed by President Joe Biden in August 2023.The House select committee on China has reportedly criticized major American index providers for channeling billions of dollars from U.S. investors into stocks of Chinese companies that the U.S. believes are aiding the development of China’s military.They target three key sectors: Semiconductors and microelectronics; quantum information technologies; and certain AI systems. The new regulations will take effect on January 2 and will be managed by the Treasury's newly established Office of Global Transactions.The Treasury emphasized that this ""narrow set of technologies"" is crucial for the next generation of military, cybersecurity, surveillance, and intelligence applications. Paul Rosen, a senior Treasury official, reportedly noted that the rule covers technologies such as ""cutting-edge code-breaking computer systems or next-generation fighter jets."" He added that U.S. investments, including intangible benefits like managerial assistance and access to investment and talent networks, must not aid countries of concern in developing their military, intelligence, and cyber capabilities.This rule is part of a broader effort to prevent U.S. expertise from assisting China in developing advanced technology and dominating global markets. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo highlighted earlier this year that these rules are essential to prevent China from advancing its military-related technologies.Beginning January 2, investors will be banned from funneling capital and “intangible benefits,” like managerial assistance and access to investment and talent networks, to help China and other “countries of concern” develop military, intelligence, and cybersecurity capabilities.The new regulations include an exception for U.S. investments in publicly traded securities. However, officials noted that the U.S. already has authorities under a previous executive order that prohibits buying and selling securities of certain designated Chinese companies.",The Biden administration announced on Monday that it is finalizing rules to restrict U.S. investments in artificial intelligence and other technology sectors in China.

Cashfree Payments gets RBI nod as well

Jio Payment Solutions , a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Group firm Jio Financial Services, has received the central bank's approval to operate as an online payment aggregator , Jio Financial said on Tuesday.The certificate of authorisation is effective from October 28. It permits the subsidiary to manage digital transactions in compliance with Section 7 of the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007. Jio Financial was spun out of the Ambani-led Reliance Group last year.This means that users will be able to use the app just the way they use GPay or Paytm. Currently, digital savings accounts with biometric authentication and a physical debit card are provided by Jio Payments Bank that is said to have over 1.5 million active users, as per The Economic Times report.A payment aggregator acts as intermediaries between customers and businesses. It is essentially a third-party service provider that enables customers to make and businesses to accept payments online. They provide a single platform that allows businesses to accept various payment methods, such as credit cards, debit cards, UPI transfers, and e-wallets, without having to deal with multiple payment processors.Jio Payment Solutions is not the only company to have got RBI’s nod. Bengaluru-based payment aggregator Cashfree Payments said it has received the Prepaid Payment Instrument (PPI) licence from the central bank, which means it can offer digital payment solutions such as mobile wallets, prepaid cards and vouchers for transactions.“The PPI licence opens up a new field of opportunity for innovation in the payments landscape. Our focus has always been to provide secure, flexible and efficient payment experiences to Indian businesses as well as their customers. The PPI licence will help us build offerings that let internet businesses retain and grow their user base,” said Akash Sinha, CEO and cofounder, Cashfree Payments.Earlier this year, online food delivery platform Zomato announced that the RBI has granted it a certificate of authorisation to its subsidiary Zomato Payments Private Limited (ZPPL) to operate as an 'Online Payment Aggregator'.","Jio Payment Solutions, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Group firm Jio Financial Services, has received the central bank's approval to operate as an online payment aggregator.

Tata Consultancy Services ( TCS ) has secured a 15-year contract by the Irish Department of Social Protection (DSP) to implement and manage the country's new automatic enrollment retirement savings scheme, "" My Future Fund ."" This initiative will provide a comprehensive digital solution for nearly 800,000 workers in Ireland .TCS will leverage its expertise in digital transformation and pension administration, gained through similar projects in the UK and other markets, to deliver a user-friendly and efficient system.“Leveraging its TCS BaNCS platform and ecosystem, TCS will oversee the administration of the scheme, enabling seamless enrolment, record management, and benefit disbursement. Services will be delivered through TCS’ Global Delivery Centre in Letterkenny, Co. Donegal, Ireland,” the company said.The “My Future Fund” pension scheme will enable thousands of workers to save and invest for their future, benefiting everyone involved, from employers and operational staff to pensioners, by improving pension record management, timely payments, effective scheme finance management, and providing easy digital access to information.Irish Minister for Social Protection, Heather Humphreys, expressed confidence in TCS's ability to deliver the project on time and to the highest standard, citing their extensive experience in managing similar schemes.“My officials and I will be working hard alongside TCS, the Revenue Commissioners and payroll software developers to make sure that My Future Fund is delivered on time and to the highest standard,” Humphreys added.TCS has experience with similar schemes in the UK and other markets, having managed the National Employment Savings Trust (NEST) since the UK government launched a digital auto-enrolment scheme in 2011.“This partnership is a fantastic opportunity for TCS Ireland to apply its deep contextual knowledge, innovation and to contribute to a project of national importance that will have a lasting impact. It is an exciting time for our talented team, as this initiative not only expands our capabilities but also job opportunities and skills development to Donegal,” said Deepak Chaudhari, country head of TCS Ireland.","TCS has secured a 15-year contract by the Irish Department of Social Protection (DSP) to implement and manage the country's new automatic enrollment retirement savings scheme.

JPMorgan Chase has filed lawsuits against customers who allegedly stole more than $661,000 through a technical glitch that went viral on social media as an "" infinite money glitch ,"" allowing fraudulent withdrawals from ATMs before deposited checks could bounce.The bank filed four separate federal lawsuits in Los Angeles, Houston, and Miami against two individuals and two businesses, seeking to recover the stolen funds plus interest, overdraft fees, and legal expenses.In the largest case, a Houston customer owes JPMorgan $290,939.47 after an unidentified masked accomplice deposited a counterfeit check for $335,000 on August 29. The customer then ""began withdrawing the vast majority of the ill-gotten funds"" before the check was rejected on September 4, according to court filings.""Chase takes its responsibility to combat fraud seriously and prioritises protecting the firm and its customers to make the banking system safer,"" the bank stated in court documents.The scheme gained traction in late August when videos on TikTok showed people celebrating large cash withdrawals from Chase ATMs shortly after depositing bad checks. The viral posts described it as a ""loophole"" in the bank's system.""Fraud is a crime that impacts everyone and undermines trust in the banking system,"" JPMorgan spokesman Drew Pusateri told CNBC. ""We're pursuing these cases and actively cooperating with law enforcement to make sure if someone is committing fraud against Chase and its customers, they're held accountable.""While banks typically allow customers to withdraw only a fraction of a check's value before it clears, the technical vulnerability enabled immediate access to the full amount.JPMorgan closed the loophole within days of the videos going viral and is now investigating thousands of potential fraud cases , according to reports.","JPMorgan Chase has filed lawsuits against customers who allegedly stole more than $661,000 through a technical glitch. The bank filed four separate federal lawsuits in Los Angeles, Houston, and Miami against two individuals and two businesses. The scheme gained traction in late August when videos on TikTok showed people celebrating large cash withdrawals from Chase ATMs.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114736808,imgsize-352802,width-400,resizemode-4/114736808.jpg"

Tencent founder drops to third

Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma’s wealth declines

TikTok-parent company ByteDance’s founder Zhang Yiming is China's richest person, according to annual Hurun China Rich List. His personal wealth reached $49.3 billion, after an increase of 43%. Zhang stepped down as chief executive of ByteDance in 2021 and has become the 18th individual to be crowned China's richest person in the 26 years since the Hurun China Rich List was first published.“Despite facing repeated US legal challenges, ByteDance generated a record US$110 billion in revenue last year. ByteDance made the Top 5 on the Hurun China 500 Most Valuable Private Companies 2023 and was the world’s most valuable unicorn on the Hurun Global Unicorns Index 2024,” it says.According to the list, he overtook ‘bottled water king’ Zhong Shanshan, who slipped to second place as his fortune dropped 24% to $47.9 billion.Tencent's founder, Pony Ma, is third in the list with$44.4 billion – up 13%. Tencent ranked second on the Hurun China 500 Most Valuable Private Companies 2023 and made the Top 20 in the 2023 Hurun Global 500.Colin Huang Zheng, founder of PDD Holdings , has dropped out of the Top 3 with $34.5 billion personal wealth, down 9%. This is despite his firm's discount-focused e-commerce platforms Temu and Pinduoduo registered revenue growth.Pinduoduo's revenue was up 86% year-on-year. Huang was briefly Number One in China, as the share price surged in the middle of the year, on the back of the continued success of its Temu platform.He Xiangjian, known as the ""Kitchen Appliances King,"" and his family have climbed to 5th place on the wealth rankings with a fortune of$33.1 billion, marking an 18% increase. Midea, the appliance giant he founded, has seen significant growth, with overseas income now accounting for 40% of its total revenue.Jack Ma Yun, 60, saw his wealth decline 3% compared to last year, with $23.2 billion. He is ranked 10. Ma, retired five years ago and now has 35% of his wealth from investments, with the rest from Alibaba and his stake in the unicorn Ant Group.Meanwhile, Xiaomi founder Lei Jun added $5 billion to his wealth this year.According to Hurun Report Chairman Rupert Hoogewerf, China’s economy and stock markets had a difficult year with most dramatic falls in fortunes coming from China's real estate sector while consumer electronics rising fast.","Zhang Yiming is China's richest person, according to annual Hurun China Rich List.

"US has stricter rules on AI investments in China, to go into effect on this date",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/us-has-stricter-rules-on-ai-investments-in-china-to-go-into-effect-on-this-date/articleshow/114732688.cms,"New rules signed by US President in 2023



Rules allow certain investments but…



The US government has said that it is finalising new regulations to restrict investments in Chinese technology sectors, including artificial intelligence (AI), semiconductors and quantum computing, saying that they may pose national security risks.According to a report by news agency Reuters, the proposed rules by the Biden administration are set to take effect on January 2. They will be implemented by the Treasury’s newly established Office of Global Transactions, the report added.The rules were passed by the US Treasury in June and prompted by an executive order President Joe Biden signed in August 2023. The Treasury described the technologies covered as critical to advancing “military, cybersecurity, surveillance, and intelligence applications.”Senior Treasury official Paul Rosen highlighted that the rule targets innovations like “cutting-edge code-breaking computers or next-generation fighter jets,” adding that US investments must not support countries deemed as security risks in developing military and intelligence capabilities.The US says that its investments often provide managerial expertise and access to talent networks. The regulation is part of a broader US strategy to prevent American expertise from aiding China’s efforts to advance in high-stakes tech sectors and dominate global markets.Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo previously emphasised the necessity of these measures to halt China’s progress in military-related technologies.While the rules do allow US investments in publicly traded Chinese securities, Treasury officials clarified that existing regulations already prevent transactions with specific Chinese companies linked to military development.Additionally, the House Select Committee on China has voiced concerns over major US index providers funnelling American capital into Chinese companies believed to support China’s military expansion.","US government is finalising new regulations to restrict investments in Chinese technology sectors, including artificial intelligence (AI), semiconductors and quantum computing.

Days after Delta Airlines sued Crowdstrike seeking$500 million in out-of-pocket damages and an unspecified amount to cover expenditures like attorneys fees, the cybersecurity firm filed a lawsuit against Delta, erupting a legal battle between the two companies.According to a report by news agency Reuters, CrowdStrike filed a case in US District Court in Georgia claiming that Delta's claims of CrowdStrike being responsible for the outage are inaccurate.The cybersecurity firm contends that Delta repeatedly refused assistance from both CrowdStrike and Microsoft, and that Delta's own response and technology contributed to delays in restoring normal operations.Delta, on the other hand, filed a lawsuit against CrowdStrike in Fulton County Superior Court, calling the faulty software update ""catastrophic"" and alleging that it caused over 8.5 million Windows computers worldwide to crash.In a lawsuit filed last week, Delta claimed the outage resulted in 7,000 flight cancellations , disrupted travel for 1.3 million customers, and cost the airline over $500 million in losses. The impact was not limited to airlines but the outage also hit hospitals and other digital infrastructure.“If CrowdStrike had tested the faulty update on even one computer before deployment, the computer would have crashed,” Delta's lawsuit says.CrowdStrike maintains that its liability is minimal, while Delta seeks over $500 million in compensation for direct losses, lost profits, reputational damage, and future revenue loss.This dispute has also attracted the attention of the US Transportation Department, which has launched an investigation into the incident.Last month, a senior CrowdStrike executive apologised before Congress for the faulty software update.","CrowdStrike claims Delta's claims of CrowdStrike being responsible for the outage are inaccurate.

What the lawsuit says



What Facebook-parent Meta, TikTok said

Brazil’s Collective Defense Institute has filed lawsuits against social media giants TikTok , Facebook-parent Meta and Kwai, reports Reuters. The report says that the organisation filed two lawsuits alleging their failure to create mechanisms to prevent excess use of these social media platforms by minors. The lawsuits demand 3 billion reais ($525.27 million) from the Brazilian units of TikTok, Kwai and Meta Platforms.The lawsuits are reportedly based on studies on the possible damage caused by unsupervised use of social media, especially by children and teenagers. They urge the courts in Minas Gerais to direct companies to establish clear data protection measures and to issue warnings regarding the potential risks to the mental health of children and teenagers stemming from platform addiction.Lawyer Lillian Salgado, one of the plaintiffs said “It is urgent that measures be adopted in order to change the way the algorithm works, the processing of data from users under 18, and the way in which teenagers aged 13 and over are supervised and their accounts created, in order to ensure a safer, healthier experience ... as is already the case in developed countries”.In a statement, Meta Platforms said that it wants “young people to have safe and age-appropriate experiences on our apps, and we have been working on these issues for over a decade, developing more than 50 tools, resources, and features to support teens and their guardians.”The company stated that it had recently announced a new “Teen Account” on Instagram , which will arrive in Brazil soon. It will automatically limit the accounts teenagers can see and who may contact them.TikTok said it had not received any notice about the case.","Brazil’s Collective Defense Institute has filed lawsuits against social media giants TikTok, Facebook-parent Meta and Kwai.
