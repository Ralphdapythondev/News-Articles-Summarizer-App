Why these hackings are dangerous

The Russian state-sponsored APT29 hacking group has been observed using the same iOS and Chrome on Android exploits created by commercial spyware vendors like NSO Group and Intellexa in a series of cyberattacks between November 2023 and July 2024.“The campaigns first delivered an iOS WebKit exploit affecting iOS versions older than 16.6.1 and then later, a Chrome exploit chain against Android users running versions from m121 to m123,” said Google 's Threat Analysis Group (TAG).Google's TAG said the n-day flaws have already been patched but remain effective on devices that have not been updated.Google says that APT29, also known as “Midnight Blizzard”, targeted multiple websites of the Mongolian government and employed “watering hole” tactics.“We assess with moderate confidence the campaigns are linked to the Russian government-backed actor APT29. In each iteration of the watering hole campaigns, the attackers used exploits that were identical or strikingly similar to exploits previously used by commercial surveillance vendors (CSVs) Intellexa and NSO Group,” it said.A watering hole is a type of cyberattack where a legitimate site is compromised with malicious code designed to deliver payloads to visitors that meet specific criteria.Google's threat analysts note that APT29 has a long history of exploiting zero-day and n-day vulnerabilities. The hackers leveraged an iOS WebKit flaw for stealing browser cookies from iPhone users running iOS 16.6.1 and older.TAG reports that this exploit was exactly the same as the one Intellexa used in September 2023, leveraging CVE-2023-41993 as a zero-day vulnerability at the time.In a similar way, APT29 leveraged exploits on Google Chrome to attack Android users visiting compromised websites. The purpose was to steal cookies, passwords, and other sensitive data stored on the victims' Chrome browser.Since the patch for these exploits are available, iPhone and Android users are advised to install updates as soon as they can to protect their privacy.",Russian state-sponsored APT29 has been observed using the same iOS and Chrome on Android exploits created by commercial spyware vendors like NSO Group and Intellexa in a series of cyberattacks.

Spotify is slamming Apple again. This time it is not for an App Store issue or in-app purchases. Spotify has accused Apple of violating the Digital Markets Act ( DMA ) by discontinuing the technology that allows users to control the volume of connected devices directly from their iPhone. This is the latest dispute between the two companies over Apple's platform policies.Previously, Spotify Connect users on iOS could adjust the volume using the physical buttons on their iPhone.However, Apple's recent changes have removed this functionality.Spotify has criticized this move as a violation of the DMA, specifically Article 6(7), which requires gatekeepers to allow for interoperability between their platforms and third-party services.Starting September 3, Spotify iOS users will be redirected to use the in-app volume slider to control the volume on connected devices. This workaround will only be necessary for Spotify Connect users on iOS and will not affect users controlling the volume on iOS Bluetooth, AirPlay sessions, or Android devices.Spotify's accusation adds to a growing list of disputes between the two companies over Apple's platform policies.

Elon Musk praised Ratan Tata

The legacy of the Tata Nano

Also read

In the world of business and innovation, few names stand as tall as Tata Group chairman emeritus Ratan Tata. The admiration for Ratan Tata transcends beyond the Indian corporate world. Tesla CEO Elon Musk too seems to be a fan of Ratan Tata. In a 2009 interview with American journalist Charlie Rose , Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, praised Ratan Tata, the chairman emeritus of Tata Sons , as a ""gentleman and a scholar."" This moment has gained renewed attention, offering insight into Musk's thoughts on Ratan Tata and his ambitious project, the Tata Nano .The Tata Nano was introduced by Tata Motors in 2008 as the world's cheapest car, with a price tag of just Rs 1 lakh (approximately $2,300 at the time). The car was a pet project of Ratan Tata, designed to make automobile ownership accessible to millions of Indians who had never been able to afford a car. The idea was revolutionary—a small, affordable car that would cater to the vast Indian middle class, providing them with a safe and efficient means of transportation.In the interview with Charlie Rose, which took place shortly after the launch of the Tata Nano, Musk was asked about his views on Ratan Tata’s efforts to introduce a low-cost car in India. The interview clip, which has recently gone viral, captures Musk's candid response.""Take for a moment Ratan Tata, what he’s doing in India — developing a little sedan for $2300. Where do you put that in the whole equation of where the future of cars is?"" asked Rose.Musk responded with a mix of admiration and caution. He began by acknowledging the brilliance behind the Tata Nano project and the character of Ratan Tata himself.""I think it's a good idea to have affordable cars, but I think the problem with something like the Nano ... I wouldn't say problem because I think, by the way, it is probably a great idea and Ratan is a gentleman and scholar,"" Musk said.However, Musk also expressed his concerns about the long-term viability of such a low-cost vehicle, particularly in the context of rising fuel prices. He pointed out that while the initial purchase cost of the Nano was remarkably low, the cost of running the car—particularly fuel costs—could become a significant issue as gasoline prices continued to rise.""But where it’s going to become challenging in the future is when the price of gasoline rises, the cost of acquiring the car is much less of an issue than the cost of running the car,"" he explained.Despite the initial excitement surrounding the Tata Nano, the car faced numerous challenges. One of the most significant issues was its branding. While the Nano was intended to be an affordable vehicle for the masses, it was often labeled as ""cheap"" rather than ""affordable."" This perception problem, combined with safety concerns and competition from other small cars, led to unimpressive sales figures.The Nano’s production was ultimately discontinued in 2018, marking the end of what was initially seen as a groundbreaking project. The car's journey from inception to discontinuation is often cited as one of the biggest marketing failures in the automobile industry.","The Tata Nano was introduced by Tata Motors in 2008 as the world's cheapest car, with a price tag of just Rs 1 lakh (approximately $2,300 at the time) The car was a pet project of Ratan Tata, designed to make automobile ownership accessible to millions of Indians.

How Youtubers Dhruv Rathee and Gaurav Taneja clashed over UP government's new social media policy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-youtubers-dhruv-rathee-and-gaurav-taneja-clashed-over-up-governments-new-social-media-policy/articleshow/112903240.cms,"Dhruv Rathee vs Gaurav Taneja

What is UP government’s new social media scheme

YouTubers Dhruv Rathee and Gaurav Taneja are in a clash again. The two engaged in a heated debate once again, this time over the Uttar Pradesh government’s new social media policy . Under this policy, influencers can earn up to Rs 8 lakh per month for promoting government initiatives1. Rathee criticised the scheme, calling it “Legalized Bribery” funded by taxpayers.His viral post on X garnered over 2 million views. In contrast, Gaurav Taneja defended the programme, questioning whether newspapers and TV channels that accept government ads should also be criticised. The exchange has sparked diverse reactions from the online community. This isn’t the first time Rathee and Taneja have clashed; they previously clashed over the “India vs. Bharat” issue in June 2024.“Uttar Pradesh Govt is saying it will pay up to Rs8 Lakh to Influencers to promote the government,” Rathee wrote. “This is Legalized Bribery. From Tax Payer's Money. Any influencer who does this should be publicly shamed,” he added.Gaurav Taneja, the 38-year-old IITian and former pilot, hit back at Rathee for this. He gave a different view on the issue. Taneja defended the scheme and wrote, ""Should all Newspapers and TV Channels, be also shamed, who show paid ads to promote any govt in power?""The UP government’s scheme aims to pay influencers for promoting government initiatives on platforms like X, Facebook, and Instagram. The Uttar Pradesh government has approved a new social media policy targeting influencers and creators. The Uttar Pradesh Digital Media Policy , 2024, was approved by Yogi Adityanath 's Cabinet earlier this week.The policy, created by the state's information department, outlines a structure for providing advertisements to agencies and individuals who create and share content about government schemes and achievements on platforms like X, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube. Influencers will be categorised into four groups based on their number of followers and subscribers.The government note said that this would create an opportunity for the people of UP residing out of the state to earn money through social media.","The Uttar Pradesh government has approved a new social media policy targeting influencers and creators.

This move is similar to initiatives in other countries, like France's repairability index, and is part of India's broader strategy to reduce electronic waste and promote sustainable practices .Consumer Affairs Secretary Nidhi Khare emphasised the potential for India to become a ""repair hub for the world"" as the country emerges as the third-largest economy globally. The initiative also aims to support local repairers and increase consumer awareness about product longevity.The government has already launched a Right to Repair Portal, with 63 companies participating, including 23 from the mobile and electronics sector. This portal is designed to provide consumers with information and resources to repair their devices.Industry stakeholders, including HCL Technologies Founder Ajai Chowdhry, have called for legislation to drive change, noting that many current products are not designed with repairability in mind.As the third-largest electronic waste producer globally, after China and the US, India's move towards a repairability index could have significant environmental impact. The initiative is expected to not only reduce e-waste but also create opportunities for third-party repairers in India's growing electronics market.","The Consumer Affairs Ministry is spearheading this initiative.

Former Amazon VP: CEO of startup I worked with got me divorced,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/former-amazon-vp-ceo-of-startup-i-worked-with-got-me-divorced/articleshow/112792027.cms,"Read the complete post here

A CEO that I worked for seduced my wife in direct retaliation for my pushback on him at work. He won. I got divorced and left the company. When I say I truly understand how some executive teams can be political snake pits, I trust you will believe me. Learn from my pain - do the following:

1) When you have a good manager, lean in and take advantage of it.

2) Spot the snakes.

3) Do excellent work, even for nasty leaders.

4) Don’t confront the snakes directly

5) Don’t become a snake

1) When you have a good manager, lean in and take advantage of it.

While I “survived” bad bosses, most of my career progress came while working for good, honest, and helpful managers.

Hold on to these managers as much as you can. Help them grow and succeed so that you can stay together, and you can grow and succeed with them. See success as a partnership with the people you can trust.

Ultimately, the key to my career success was excelling when I had good managers and just surviving in the periods when I did not.

Also, notice I say take advantage of “it”, not “them”. Take advantage of and benefit from having a good manager.

Don’t become dishonest and take advantage of someone else for your benefit.

I recognized early on that my CEO in the divorce story was unethical and dishonest. My mistake was letting fear of a tough economy convince me to try to stay in the job and ""win"" by pushing back. It cost me far more than I ever thought it could.

Action: Do whatever you need to get to a good manager! Leave before the snake bites.

2) Spot the snakes.

Generally, it doesn’t take long to figure out who is a good person and who is only looking out for themselves.

There are so many ways to see through the dishonest people:

– See if their actions match their words

–Talk to others who have been there longer - they know!

– Investigate their pasts - talk to someone who used to work for them but is now safely away

A smooth talker may fool you in person, particularly if you give people the benefit of the doubt. Observing carefully and doing your research can help you not fall for the charm of someone you shouldn’t trust.

Being cautious is important, but there is a big difference between being watchful and skeptical and being cynical and untrusting. Extend some trust in case your leader is a good person, but do not make yourself fully vulnerable until you know.

With the CEO I talk about, I had ""spotted the snake"" - my mistake was staying too long and getting bitten.

3), 4), and 5)

I'm out of room here. To read about why you need to do excellent work for nasty execs, why you shouldn't confront them, and about not becoming a snake yourself, subscribe to our newsletter.

Telegram chief executive Pavel Durov was arrested at a Paris airport for offences related to his popular messaging app. Durov was detained at Le Bourget airport in Paris after arriving on a private jet. Telegram is an encrypted messaging app, ranked as one of the major social media platforms after Facebook, YouTube, WhatsApp, Instagram , TikTok and WeChat.Durov is accused of failing to take action to curb the criminal use of his platform.

A cybersecurity gendarmerie unit and France 's national anti-fraud police unit are leading the investigation.Encrypted messaging app Telegram allows groups of up to 200,000 members, which has led to accusations that it makes it easier for false information to spread virally.

Telegram has become a major source of unfiltered content from both sides of the Ukraine war. Ukrainian and Russian governments both use Telegram heavily. The platform has become what some analysts call 'a virtual battlefield' for the war, used heavily by Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and his officials, as well as the Russian government.Tesla CEO Elon Musk posted the hashtag #FreePavel on the X social media platform, formerly Twitter. He wrote in French, ""Liberte Liberte! Liberte?"" (Freedom Freedom! Freedom?).

"Why TRAI's ‘September 1 deadline’ for Airtel, Reliance Jio and Vodafone-Idea is ‘bad news’ for your OTPs",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-trais-september-1-deadline-for-airtel-reliance-jio-and-vodafone-idea-is-bad-news-for-your-otps/articleshow/112787423.cms,"What is the big change

What is Whitelisting or URLs

Similar disruption in 2021

Starting September 1, consumers might experience disruptions in receiving service and transactional messages from banks, financial institutions, and e-commerce firms on their mobile phones. This follows a directive from the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) aimed at reducing spam, particularly phishing attempts.Trai has instructed telecom companies to stop transmitting messages containing URLs, OTT links, APKs (Android application packages), or call-back numbers that are not whitelisted—registered with telcos—by senders from September 1.This directive means that banks, financial institutions, and online platforms must register their message templates and content with operators by August 31. If they fail to do so, messages containing these elements will be blocked.Currently, entities register their headers and templates with telcos but not the content of messages. This means operators do not check the content of transmitted messages. However, starting next month, telcos must create a mechanism to read the content of commercial messages and block those that do not match their records, according to experts.In India, 1.5-1.7 billion commercial messages are sent daily, totaling about 55 billion every month, according to industry data.Airtel, Reliance Jio and Vodafone-Idea want extension in deadlineAccording to a report in Economic Times, industry executives say the telecom sector is seeking more time from Trai to implement the mandate as the blockchain-based distributed ledger technology (DLT) platform needs updating. However, the regulator believes it has given sufficient time to the telcos and is unwilling to extend the deadline, according to officials familiar with the matter.Bharti Airtel, Reliance Jio, and Vodafone Idea did not respond to ET’s queries.Whitelisting requires entities sending messages to provide all information related to URLs, call-back numbers, etc., to telcos, who will then feed the information into their DLT platform. If the information matches, the message is passed; otherwise, it is blocked.For example, most transactional messages from banks, such as funds debit or credit, contain a call-back number. Transmission of such messages will be stopped if a bank does not whitelist the number.“Only those entities, including banks, which whitelist their URLs or content of the messages with telcos, will pass through; the rest will be blocked,” said a telecom industry executive.Mobile consumers faced a similar outage in March 2021 when the DLT platform was implemented, and telcos started scrubbing messages. At that time, there was widespread disruption as telcos blocked all commercial messages that did not contain whitelisted headers and templates. Following the disruption, all entities have since registered their headers and templates with telcos.Experts say that in the current scenario, an increasing number of messages may shift to over-the-top (OTT) platforms like WhatsApp and Google’s rich communication services (RCS) messaging, as there is no such mandate from Trai to govern them. However, banking messages, where rules do not permit transmission over OTT, will be blocked if the entities have not been whitelisted, the experts added.","Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) has instructed telecom companies to stop transmitting messages containing URLs, OTT links, APKs, or call-back numbers that are not whitelisted by senders.

Google kills Fitbit smartwatches; says smartwatch portfolio now is ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-kills-fitbit-smartwatches-says-smartwatch-portfolio-now-is-/articleshow/112651343.cms,"Fitbit as a smartwatch brand is effectively over. No surprises, as many would say. The writing has been there on the wall for sometime now. Google acquired Fitbit in 2021, since then there were speculations about the future of the brand. While since 2021, Google launched three Pixel series smartwatches, including the Pixel Watch 3 at the recent 'Made for Google' event, there have been two Fitbit smartwatches -- Versa 4 and Sense 2.The Fitbit Versa 4 and Sense 2 were launched just months before Google’s first Pixel Watch.Google has now confirmed that Fitbit as a brand will no longer be making new smartwatches and that the Pixel Watch series will be taking over that form factor going forward. Speaking to Engadget, Google’s director of product management for Pixel wearables, Sandeep Waraich, said, “Pixel Watch is our smartwatch part of the portfolio”. Waraich said the same in response to a question about the future of the Fitbit-branded smartwatches, adding that Pixel Watch is “our next iteration of smartwatch for Fitbit.”But while you may not get Fitbit smartwatches, Fitbit brand per se is not being killed. Google will continue to make Fitbit fitness bands . Fitbit-branded products will focus on trackers that are “more minimalistic” with long battery life, said Waraich.As to what happens to Fitbit smartwatch customers . Google said, ""We are very committed to Fitbit, and even more importantly to the customers that use and depend on those products and technology. It's also worth noting that many of the health and fitness features we launched in Pixel Watch 3 were because of Fitbit's innovation and ground-breaking fitness advancements. In addition, we just launched Fitbit Ace LTE , and you’ll continue to see new products and innovation from Fitbit.""This means that Google will continue to provide software updates, and even new features to both devices.As for Pixel Watch fans, Google has launched Pixel Watch 3 in India, starting at RS 39,99. Pixel Watch 3 will go on sale in the country in September.","Google acquired Fitbit in 2021, since then there were speculations about the future of the brand.
