Not an outright ban, so far

Strategic goals behind the Chinese government 'request'

Self-Sufficiency:

Prepare for Future Restrictions:

Nvidia's Big dilemma

China's AI Ambitions

China is reportedly ramping up efforts to boost its domestic artificial intelligence (AI) chip industry and lessen reliance on US companies like Nvidia. This move comes amidst ongoing tensions with the US and potential future sanctions. According to a report in Bloomberg, ""Beijing is stepping up pressure on Chinese companies to buy locally produced artificial intelligence chips instead of Nvidia Corp.products, part of the nation’s effort to expand its semiconductor industry and counter US sanctions .""The US government banned Nvidia from selling its most advanced AI processors to Chinese customers in 2022. Nvidia, based in Santa Clara, California, modified subsequent versions of the chips so that they could be sold under US Commerce Department regulations. The H20 line fits that criteria.Instead of an outright ban, Chinese regulators are using ""window guidance"" - unofficial but strong encouragement - to persuade companies to switch from Nvidia's H20 chips, crucial for AI development, to homegrown alternatives like those from Cambricon and Huawei. ""In recent months, several Chinese regulators, including the powerful Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, issued so-called window guidance — instructions without the force of law — to reduce the use of Nvidia,"" said the Bloomberg report quoting sources.This push for domestic chips aims to achieve two key goals:China wants to reduce dependence on foreign chipmakers, particularly in critical technological areas like AI.It also serves as a precaution against potential future US export controls.Balancing Act:While encouraging domestic options, China acknowledges the importance of building top-notch AI systems. If that requires continued use of some foreign semiconductors, it seems Beijing will still tolerate it.Caught between US regulations and a lucrative Chinese market, Nvidia is navigating a tricky situation. The company's CEO emphasizes compliance with US restrictions while striving to serve its Chinese customers.Despite US restrictions, China's AI industry continues to flourish. Major tech companies like ByteDance and Alibaba are making significant investments, alongside a wave of promising AI startups.While China boasts a booming AI sector, its homegrown AI chipmakers have yet to catch up to Nvidia's advanced technology. However, significant government subsidies are fueling efforts to bridge this gap.There are also reports about some Chinese companies that while some heed the government's call, others are said to be stockpiling Nvidia chips in anticipation of further US sanctions. This highlights the complex nature of the situation.","China is reportedly ramping up efforts to boost its domestic artificial intelligence (AI) chip industry.

iPhone repair fraud: Two sentenced to jail for scam that cost Apple $2.5 million,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/iphone-repair-fraud-two-sentenced-to-jail-for-scam-that-cost-apple-2-5-million/articleshow/113924106.cms,"Duo caused Apple total loss of $2.5million

Sun and Xue sentenced to prison

Two Chinese nationals Haotian Sun and Pengfei Xue were sentenced to jail in a scheme to defraud Apple out of 6,000 iPhones worth over $2.5 million. The US Department of Justice (DoJ) in a press release said that the duo will spend more than four years in prison. The sentences were announced U.S. Attorney Matthew M. Graves, Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Nicole M.Argentieri of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, Inspector in Charge Damon E. Wood of the United States Postal Inspection Service (USPIS) Washington Division, and Special Agent in Charge Derek W. Gordon of Homeland Security Investigations Washington Field Office.According to the government’s evidence, between May 2017 and September 2019, Sun, Xue, and other conspirators defrauded Apple by submitting counterfeit iPhones for repair to get the company to exchange them with genuine replacement iPhones. In a press release, DoJ said that Sun and Xue received shipments of inauthentic iPhones from Hong Kong at UPS mailboxes throughout the D.C. metropolitan area. They then submitted the fake iPhones , with spoofed serial numbers and/or IMEI numbers, to Apple retail stores and Apple Authorized Service Providers, including the Apple Store in Georgetown.Evidence showed that members of the conspiracy submitted more than 6,000 inauthentic phones to Apple during the conspiracy, causing an intended loss of approximately $3.8 million and an actual loss of more than $2.5 million.Haotian Sun was sentenced to 57 months in prison, three years of supervised release, and ordered to pay $1,072,200 in restitution to Apple and a forfeiture money judgment of $53,610. Pengfei Xue, on the other hand was sentenced to 54 months in prison, three years of supervised release, and ordered to pay $397,800 in restitution to Apple and a forfeiture money judgment of $19,890.Back in February this year, Sun and Xue were both found guilty of conspiracy to commit mail fraud following a five-day jury trial. Additionally, Sun was convicted of one count of mail fraud, while Xue was convicted of six counts.","Two Chinese nationals Haotian Sun and Pengfei Xue were sentenced to jail in a scheme to defraud Apple out of 6,000 iPhones worth over $2.5 million.

Why rival browsers want EU to take action against Microsoft Edge,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-rival-browsers-want-eu-to-take-action-against-microsoft-edge/articleshow/113918154.cms,"Edge should come under DMA

Microsoft exempted Edge from DMA purview

Several web browser developers have urged the regulators in the European Union (EU) to take action against Microsoft , alleging that the company is unfairly promoting its Edge browser on Windows at the expense of competitors.In a letter to the European Commission , Vivaldi, Waterfox, Wavebox and the Open Web Advocacy group argue that Microsoft is exploiting its dominance in the PC market to give Edge an unfair advantage, as per news agency Reuters.They point to Edge being the default browser on Windows and allege that Microsoft uses misleading pop-up messages to discourage users from switching to other browsers.These companies support a legal challenge by Opera , which argues that Edge should be subject to the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA), which aims to prevent large online platforms from abusing their market power and ensure fair competition.“It is paramount that the Commission reconsiders its position,” they said in a letter.“No platform independent browser can aspire to match Edge's unparalleled distribution advantage on Windows. Edge is, moreover, the most important gateway for consumers to download an independent browser on Windows PCs,” the group added.They claim that since Edge comes pre-installed on Windows, it gives it an advantage as it becomes the primary way for users to download other browsers. They also said that Microsoft misrepresents the features of competing browsers in its pop-up messages.In a February decision, the European Commission exempted Edge from the DMA, stating that it didn't consider it a dominant player, hence it cannot be considered as a gatekeeper. Notably, Edge's global market share is about 5% while market leader Google's Chrome is 66%, as per StatCounter.","Vivaldi, Waterfox, Wavebox and the Open Web Advocacy group argue that Microsoft is exploiting its dominance in the PC market.

"Pokemon Scarlet and Violet players may soon face a new 7-star Tera Raid boss, here's what to expect",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/gaming/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-players-may-soon-face-a-new-7-star-tera-raid-boss-heres-what-to-expect/articleshow/113806334.cms,"Infernape Tera Raid boss: Expected start date, time and more



Take a look at the post here



Pokemon Scarlet and Violet players may face a new fiery challenge in early October as Infernape, the popular fourth-generation Fire-type starter, takes over Seven-Star Tera Raid dens. Infernape is a significantly tougher opponent than the previous Serperior. It is known for its high speed and powerful attacks and will reportedly replace Serperior the Unrivaled as the next formidable Tera Raid boss.While possessing a versatile move set and impressive offensive stats, trainers should be wary of its low HP and susceptibility to Water, Flying, and Ground-type attacks.According to a report by Serebii.net, the fighting against Infernape the Unrivaled will commence on Thursday, October 3 at 8:00 pm EST (5.30 am IST) and continue until Sunday, October 6 at 7:59 pm EST (5.29 IST). A second opportunity to face this challenging foe will be available the following week, from October 10 to 13 at the same time.In a post on social media platform X (earlier Twitter), Serebii.net shares all the details.Players can acquire Infernape in Pokemon Scarlet and Violet by catching a Chimchar in the Terarium's Polar Biome and evolving it. Prepare your teams and strategies to face this challenging opponent in the upcoming Tera Raids. The Infernape will boast the Rock-type as its Tera type and will reward successful trainers with the coveted Mightiest Mark.Just like previous Tera Raid bosses, Infernape the Unrivaled, will possess its Hidden Ability,Iron Fist , which will significantly amplify the power of its punching moves. Therefore, trainers should anticipate facing attacks like Mach Punch, Fire Punch, and Thunder Punch.Additionally, Infernape will utilise its Rock Tera type with moves such as Stone Edge or Rock Slide, potentially combining them with disruptive tactics like Taunt and Swords Dance. Despite the defensive nature of Rock-type Pokemon, Infernape's inherent fragility leaves it open to attacks from Water, Ground, and Fighting types.Trainers are advised to prepare their teams and strategies carefully to overcome this formidable opponent. Also, trainers preparing to challenge Infernape the Unrivaled should prioritise building teams with strong defences to withstand its powerful punches.","Pokemon Scarlet and Violet players may face a new fiery challenge in early October.

iPhone 15 scam: How a Bengaluru man caught fake Flipkart delivery man,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/social/iphone-15-scam-how-a-bengaluru-man-caught-fake-flipkart-delivery-man/articleshow/113840201.cms,"Take a look at the post here

Image credit: Reddit

A Bengaluru resident has exposed a delivery scam attempt. This scam involved a fake Flipkart delivery man who tried to deliver a fake package disguised as an iPhone 15. The resident, who had ordered an iPhone 15 with 256GB storage and opted for an open-box delivery , claims that a man dressed in a white t-shirt posed as a Flipkart delivery executive and attempted to hand over a sealed package.To prevent customers from receiving damaged or incorrect items, online retailers like Amazon and Flipkart often offer an ""open-box delivery"" option for high-value purchases. This allows customers to inspect the product before accepting the delivery, ensuring they receive exactly what they ordered. The imposter reportedly pressured the resident to accept the package without inspection, but fled the scene when the resident started recording the interaction.In the post, he wrote: “My sister bought an iPhone 15 with VIP on the Flipkart sale, it was an open box delivery. This loser (a guy in white) came with a big package to deliver claiming that he couldn't do an ‘open box delivery’. We have to accept it as is. I refused. He called some random people and they said there was no facility like that. He was scared shitless because I recorded all this. Telling his partners in crime in Kannada that I have recorded everything and all. I did not accept the package. Within two minutes another guy came to deliver a very small package and said that he would open the box before delivering it. We got the product because I recorded everything, otherwise I am sure he would have given me some random package.”At the end of the post also shared the pictures of the delivery executives . Here’s is the one who the customer flagged as a fake one:How users reacted to this postThe Reddit post got a lot of significant attention as it sparked a wave of users sharing similar concerns about trustworthiness and scams on online marketplaces . Many recounted their own experiences of receiving damaged, incorrect, or even empty packages despite opting for open-box deliveries.In the comments section, one user wrote: “Nice bro. Glad you knew something was off and recorded everything. It's very hard to trust Flipkart now. Their association with an insane amount of scammers in all delivery pipelines is really scary. It's really disturbing you know that Flipkart can't do or doesn't do anything about the scamming happening during the delivery.”Meanwhile, another user noted: “Just yesterday I received a laptop. Did an open box check, and even waited for the initial irritating Windows setup and upgrade to complete, to check that the processor and other details are as expected.In the past, Amazon sent me a laptop with a gen 4 i5 processor, instead of a gen 8, that I had ordered. And my stupid ass realised it after a year, when I ran some benchmarks.The Flipkart guy was obviously in a hurry, as I was clearly taking more time than I should have. (In my defence, I couldn't accept a 90k laptop, without being sure that it was the correct one)I finally have him 200 rupees, and then he was more than happy to wait for 45 minutes. He went ahead and made 2-3 more deliveries, then came back and took the OTP from me.I made a 40 minute long video, from the moment on unboxing, till verifying everything.The only reason I order costlier items from Flipkart and not Amazon, is for open box deliveries. If they do any drama in that, they can take it back.”",A Bengaluru resident has exposed a delivery scam attempt.

""DPI in a Box"" is a plug-and-play solution: Bedi

Launch of Gemini Flash 1.5 AI model in India

Google is aiming to take India's digital success story to the world. At the 10th edition of its ‘ Google for India 'event, the company announced Digital Public Infrastructure , or "" DPI in a Box ,"" a toolkit that can help other countries build their own digital systems, similar to India's, in an easy manner.""India, I think, is right now, towering head and shoulders above most economies in the DPI world,"" Bikram Bedi, vice-president and managing director-India at Google Cloud , told reporters on the sidelines of the Google For India 2024 event.This toolkit – which will allow other countries to establish digital infrastructure like UPI , Aadhar, DigiYatra, Fastag and others – is built with Google's cloud technology and offers suite for identity storage, management and access.""What we built in India is really world class...and as we take [the] leadership position globally in this space – especially with global South – our job was to work to try and see how we could take some of the things that we built in India to the world,"" he added.Google is working with organisations in India to make it simple for other countries to adopt and benefit from India's experience with digital public infrastructure.

He said that this has been possible because India's digital infrastructure is way better than various other countries.""I think Indian tech infrastructure is, perhaps, leapfrogging the number of economies in the world. I think what the government has been doing to build this infrastructure, we're ahead of so many [countries],"" he noted.""India has taken a leadership position with the global South.

In the aftermath of Hurricane Helene , which caused extensive power outages and disrupted cellular service across Asheville, residents have turned to their iPhones’ satellite messaging feature for communication. This advanced functionality, available on iPhone 14 models and later versions, has been widely praised for its ability to help people stay connected during emergencies.As traditional communication networks went down, satellite messaging became a lifeline for many. Social media platforms were flooded with posts from Asheville residents, encouraging others to upgrade to iOS 18 to access the feature. This version of Apple 's operating system enables users to send and receive messages via satellite, bypassing the need for cellular service—proving especially critical in natural disasters.One Asheville resident, Matt Van Swol, shared on social media the impact of the feature: ""Due to the lack of cell service, EVERYONE in Asheville NC right now on iOS 18 has been able to get messages out and in with the satellite messaging feature."" His post highlighted the vital role the technology played in keeping people connected during the emergency.Many others echoed Van Swol’s sentiments, sharing personal stories of how satellite messaging allowed them to communicate with loved ones. One user recounted how the feature helped them notify their family in Georgia of their safety amidst the chaos caused by the hurricane.Despite the technology's benefits, not everyone had access to this capability. Business Insider’s Jeneane Nicodemus reported being unable to reach her daughter in Asheville for three days, illustrating that the feature’s availability is limited to newer iPhone models and specific Google Pixel devices.The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) released data that further underscored the extent of the damage. By Monday at 9 a.m. ET, 370 out of 1,452 cell sites across North Carolina were still offline due to the widespread power outages caused by the storm.As the storm moved northward, social media became a hub for information on how to activate satellite messaging. Platforms like TikTok were flooded with tutorials on enabling the feature on iOS 18, providing critical guidance for those unfamiliar with the technology. This wave of educational content helped people stay informed, particularly as they faced uncertainty and limited connectivity.Though many people used satellite messaging to reassure family members of their safety, Apple has stressed the importance of the feature for emergency use. The company recommends utilizing satellite messaging primarily for contacting emergency services when immediate help is needed. However, its broader use during Hurricane Helene demonstrated its versatility as a communication tool during crises.As communities continue to rebuild in the wake of the hurricane, the widespread adoption of satellite messaging during this disaster showcases the potential of technology to keep people connected, even in the most challenging circumstances.","Satellite messaging allows users to send and receive messages via satellite, bypassing the need for cellular service.

“For those not aware, a few months ago after reaching out to me, YouTube contacted the App Store stating that Juno does not adhere to YouTube guidelines and modifies the website in a way they don’t approve of, and alludes to their trademarks and iconography.

I don’t personally agree with this, as Juno is just a web view, and acts as little more than a browser extension that modifies CSS to make the website and video player look more “visionOS” like. No logos are placed other than those already on the website, and the “for YouTube” suffix is permitted in their branding guidelines. Juno also doesn’t block ads in any capacity, for the curious.

I stated as much to YouTube, they wouldn’t really clarify or budge any, and as a result of both parties not being able to come to a conclusion I received an email a few minutes ago from Apple that Juno has been removed from the App Store.

Juno was a fun hobby project for me to build. As a developer I wanted to get some experience building for the Vision Pro, and as a user I wanted a nice way to watch YouTube on this cool new device. As a result I really enjoyed building Juno, but it was always something I saw as fundamentally an app I built for fun.

Because of that, I have zero desire to spin this into a massive fight (at least more than I’ve fought in emails over the last few months) akin to what happened with Reddit years ago. That’s kind of the opposite of fun. I hope that’s understandable.

For those who have Juno, to my knowledge it should continue to work fine until/unless the YouTube website updates in some fashion that breaks stuff. Sorry it had to end this way, I had some really cool stuff planned for it that I think would have been a lot of fun! It’s been genuinely awesome hearing all the kind words from Vision Pro users who have loved the app.”","Juno is a browser extension that modifies the YouTube website and video player to make it look more “visionOS” like.

Take a look at the post here



What Shooster said about the AI voice clone scam



“Today, my dad got a phone call no parent ever wants to get. He heard me tell him I was in a serious car accident, injured, and under arrest for a DUI and I needed $30,000 to be bailed out of jail. But it wasn't me. There was no accident. It was an AI scam.”

“I'm not sure it was a coincidence that this happened just days after my voice went up on television. Fifteen seconds of me talking. More than enough to make a decent AI clone.”

“As a

consumer protection lawyer

, I've literally given presentations about this exact sort of scam, posted online about it, and I've talked to my family about it, but they still almost fell for it. That's how effective these scams are. Please spread the word to your friends and family,”

Side-effects of AI voice cloning tech and how to stay safe



“A very sad side-effect of this voice-cloning tech is that now people in *real* emergencies will have to prove their identities to their loved ones with passwords etc. Can you imagine your parent doubting whether they're actually talking to you when you really need help?”

A US resident recently shared how his father almost fell victim to a voice-cloning scam. Jay Shooster , who is running for the Florida State House, revealed that scammers used AI to clone his voice. He also noted that these scammers deceived his parents into believing he had been in a car accident and arrested for DUI and demanded Rs 25 lakh (approximately $30,000) for bail.Shooster believes the scammers obtained a voice sample from a recent TV appearance he made.In a series of posts on X (earlier Twitter), Shooster explained the entire incident. He wrote:Adding to the thread of the X post he explained how scammers got hold of his voice.

Shooster wrote: “Several folks have asked how they figured out it was a scam. Seems like the main thing that tipped them off was that they wouldn't accept payment via card.

What Dyson said

Dyson has announced job cuts at the company's headquarters in Singapore. Affected employees were notified via email to attend individual meetings, during which HR representatives informed them that their roles had been eliminated due to redundancy, as reported by CNA. The job cuts, described as ‘surprise’ by employees, came just three months after Dyson had assured that its global headquarters would not be impacted by a previous restructuring that resulted in approximately 1,000 position eliminations in the UK.The report quotes an anonymous employee recalling the sudden layoffs who said: “The HR representative will be in the room.Unfortunately, reason given (was) the job is redundant, and we need to pack our things and prepare to leave. We won't know who was called into the room ... (I) saw lots of envelopes.”“People are shocked and have low morale, as they aren't sure when their turn might come,” said the employee, adding that the announcement came as a ""surprise"".Another employee said “Suddenly, people are taking their bags. I thought they are going out to other offices for meetings but … they are actually leaving,” adding that the office atmosphere has been “solemn” all day.As per the report, employees from the manufacturing and procurement departments have been laid off. However, the exact number of job cuts is not known yet.Dyson had previously conducted a round of layoffs in Johor Bahru where it has a development centre, one of the employees said. But Tuesday’s retrenchment exercise in Singapore was unexpected, given how the firm had announced it was stepping up investments here.The report quotes a Dyson spokesperson as saying: “We constantly evolve the composition of our teams and take steps to ensure we have the right skills in the right places. Our ambitions in Singapore remain unchanged, and we anticipate that we will continue to grow here in the medium term.”","Dyson has announced job cuts at the company's headquarters in Singapore.

Sharing your location with friends and family is about to get easier on Android devices. Google is reportedly rolling out a new feature that will allow users to share their live location directly from the Android settings, eliminating the need to rely on separate apps like Google Maps.Previously, sharing live location on Android required users to open an app like Google Maps, navigate menus, and select the desired recipient.The new feature streamlines the process by integrating live location sharing into the Android operating system itself.Users will be able to access the new feature by navigating to ""Google"" settings in the main settings menu, then selecting "" Location Services ."" Under ""Location Sharing,"" users will find a toggle to turn on live location sharing and a list of contacts with whom they can share their location.This new functionality offers several advantages. Firstly, it provides a more convenient and centralised way to manage live location sharing. Users no longer need to switch between different apps, simplifying the process. Additionally, the integration with system settings suggests potential future enhancements, such as location sharing options within notifications or through voice commands.While the rollout is currently in its initial stages, it is expected to reach a wider range of Android devices in the coming weeks.","Google is reportedly rolling out a new feature that will allow users to share their live location directly from the Android settings.

Apple's highly anticipated personal intelligence system, Apple Intelligence, is expected to roll out this month (October). The system, announced back in June 2024, offers a range of AI-powered features designed to enhance communication, work, and self-expression. However, Apple has opted for a staggered release, with some features arriving in October and others rolling out throughout the rest of the year and into 2025.The first wave of Apple Intelligence features arrived in beta form on October 1st with the release of iOS 18.1.These features include Writing Tools, Clean Up in Photos, improved natural language search within Photos, notification summaries, and features for Focus mode such as Intelligent Breakthrough and Silencing.While these initial features offer a glimpse into the capabilities of Apple Intelligence, users eager for more will have to wait. According to Apple, features like ChatGPT integration and Genmoji, which uses AI to generate emojis based on user input, will be released later, possibly with iOS 18.2.""The phased rollout makes sense from a user experience standpoint. It allows Apple to ensure each feature is polished and bug-free before it reaches a wider audience”, said Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman.Apple Intelligence is currently exclusive to the iPhone 16 lineup and the iPhone 15 Pro/Pro Max. While other iOS 18-compatible phones can download updates like iOS 18.1, they won't have access to Apple Intelligence features.","Apple's personal intelligence system, Apple Intelligence, is expected to roll out this month (October) The system, announced back in June 2024, offers a range of AI-powered features designed to enhance communication, work, and self- expression.
