Xiaomi claims it was made 'opposite party' in CCI probe without notice; here’s what the company said in regulatory filing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/xiaomi-claims-it-was-made-opposite-party-in-cci-probe-without-notice-heres-what-the-company-said-in-regulatory-filing/articleshow/114527872.cms,"Representative Image

What Xiaomi said in its regulatory filing

Xiaomi Technology India has filed a complaint with the Registrar of Companies (RoC) stating that the Competition Commission of India (CCI) named it as an ""opposite party"" in a recent investigation without prior notice or allowing it to present its case. The company is now seeking to join a ""confidentiality ring"" to defend its position. The filing also revealed that Xiaomi India's revenues declined for the second consecutive year in 2023-24, as the company continues to face multiple regulatory investigations in the country.The CCI launched an investigation against smartphone brands including Xiaomi for launching exclusive models on e-commerce platforms like Amazon and Flipkart allegedly against the country’s competition rules.In a RoC filing dated October 19, Xiaomi said “A non-confidential, heavily redacted version of the DG (Director General of CCI) report has been shared with the company and hence the exact nature of the allegations, the basis for the same along with the evidence relied upon are not clear. During its investigation, the DG had sought information from the company in its capacity as a third party and not as an opposite party. Unexpectedly, the DG report, without putting the company on notice or giving it an opportunity to be heard, has arrayed it as an opposite party,”.The company said that it was in the process of evaluating the CCI order, the DG report and the related documents shared.“Applications have been filed for the constitution of a confidentiality ring to get access to the confidential version of the reports and related documents. The next steps will be decided only upon obtaining full and complete information and access to the confidential DG report and other case records,” it said.","Xiaomi Technology India has filed a complaint with the Registrar of Companies.

"JioHotstar domain bought by an app developer who wants Reliance to fund his higher studies, read his 'letter' to the company",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/jiohotstar-domain-bought-by-an-app-developer-who-wants-reliance-to-fund-his-higher-studies-read-his-letter-to-the-company/articleshow/114517530.cms,"Here's the letter as it appears on https://jiohotstar.com:

Dear Executive of Reliance Industries,

I am an app developer based in Delhi, currently working on my startup. In early 2023, while scrolling through social media, I came across a news piece stating that Disney+ Hotstar was losing daily active users after losing the IPL streaming license, and Disney is considering selling or merging Hotstar with an Indian competitor.

This led me to hypothesize that, since Sony and Zee were pursuing their own merger, Viacom 18 (owned by Reliance) is the only major player with sufficient resources to acquire Disney+ Hotstar. This reminded me of when Jio acquired the music streaming service Saavn, they rebranded it to JioSaavn, and changed the domain from Saavn.com to JioSaavn.com.

I thought, ""If they acquire Hotstar, they might rename it to JioHotstar.com."" I checked for the domain, and it was available. I was excited, as I felt that if this happened, I could fund my goal of studying at Cambridge.

In 2021, I was working on a project that was selected for the Cambridge University Accelerate program. It was a transformational experience for me. I couldn't crack IIT and always wanted to learn from the best, coming from a Tier-ll college, being selected for this program was an incredibly valuable and practical experience. The startup program taught me many valuable lessons and provided insights into the ins and outs of startups for free, which was amazing. However, it was limited in scope - after all it was just a startup program.

Cambridge also offers a full degree program in entrepreneurship, which l've always dreamed of pursuing but could never afford, It's Cambridge, quite expensive. When I saw this domain become available, I felt things might just fall into place.

My intention of buying this domain was simple: if this merger happens, I might be able to fulfill my dream of studying at Cambridge

Now that the merger has actually happened, and news sources are confirming there will be only one site post-merger (either JioCinema or Hotstar.com), I believe JioHotstar.com would be a very fitting brand name for the merged entity. It maintains the brand equity of both brands and provides a rational transition for the current users of both sites.

To acquire this domain, kindly reach out to mail@jiohotstar.com from your company email address with an official letter attached, stating your authorization to purchase on behalf of Reliance Industries/Viacom18. For a multi-billion dollar company like Reliance, this will be a minor expense, but for me, the sale of this domain would be truly life-changing.

Best Regards,

A dreamer.

Reliance-Disney media company may come in November

It appears that an app developer predicted Reliance JioCinema and Disney HotStar merger. The Delhi-based app developer has bought the JioHotstar domain on the internet. In a letter -- posted on https://jiohotstar.com -- addressed executives of Reliance Industries , the app developer has asked the company to find his higher studies in exchange for him giving up the domain.""My intention of buying this domain was simple: if this merger happens, I might be able to fulfill my dream of studying at Cambridge ,"" said the app developer, who has signed off as ""a dreamer"" in the letter. Times of India Tech checked the URL and it indeed goes to the page which has the app developers letter addressed to Reliance Industries management.The merger between Reliance Industries Limited's (RIL) Viacom18 and Walt Disney 's Star India is reportedly set to be officially concluded in early November after securing regulatory approvals in India. It is expected to create India's biggest and the most powerful media and entertainment conglomerate valued at $8.5 billion. As part of the merger deal, Viacom18 will transfer its assets to Star India, which will be the operating company post the merger.The merger, announced on February 28, has been completed in a record eight months, securing approvals from the Competition Commission of India (CCI), the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), and the ministry of information and broadcasting (MIB). The CCI granted conditional approval.",A Delhi-based app developer has bought the JioHotstar domain on the internet.

This suggests the iPhone SE 4 could ditch the older design language in favour of a more modern look, featuring flat edges, a smaller notch for the Face ID system, and a single rear camera.The dummy units reportedly have the same dimensions as the current iPhone SE (146.7mm x 71.5mm x 7.8mm), hinting at a familiar form factor. However, the report also mentions the existence of a larger dummy unit, potentially hinting at an "" iPhone SE 4 Plus "" variant with a size similar to the iPhone 14 Plus (6.7-inch display).While Macotakara acknowledges that the existence of a Plus size option is unconfirmed, the possibility has piqued the interest of fans who may favour a larger display on a budget-friendly iPhone.It's important to note that these are leaks based on dummy units, not official confirmation from Apple. While the iPhone 14-inspired design seems likely, the existence of a Plus size model remains unverified.Apple is typically tight-lipped about upcoming products, so fans will need to wait for an official announcement to know for sure what the iPhone SE 4 will look like and what features it will offer.","Images of alleged iPhone SE 4 dummy units have surfaced online.

Infosys’ resilience amidst market challenges

(With inputs from PTI)

Infosys, a leading IT firm co-founded by Narayana Murthy, saw a remarkable increase in its market capitalization, adding Rs 6,913.33 crore in just five days, as per a report by PTI. By October 14, 2024, the company's market value had reached Rs 8.15 lakh crore, with shares closing at Rs 1,966. This positive performance comes amid a volatile market, where several other major Indian firms, such as Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and Reliance Industries, faced declines in market capitalization.According to PTI, Infosys saw consistent gains over the course of the week.The company's market capitalization rose from Rs 8,03,440.41 crore to Rs 8.15 lakh crore in five days, a notable achievement in the IT sector. On Monday, October 14, Infosys' share price surged by Rs 30.90, reinforcing the company’s strong momentum.Despite Infosys' impressive gains, Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries continues to hold its place as India's most valuable domestic company, followed by Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), HDFC Bank, Bharti Airtel, ICICI Bank, Infosys, and others. Infosys, while growing, still trails these giants in overall market capitalization.While Infosys thrived, the broader market was marked by significant losses. Seven of India’s top ten companies, including TCS and Reliance, experienced a combined market value drop of Rs 1,22,107.11 crore. TCS, India’s largest IT company, saw its market valuation plunge by Rs 35,638.16 crore, while Reliance Industries lost Rs 21,351.71 crore. This decline is attributed to weak equity market trends, with the BSE benchmark index falling by 0.37%.Infosys’ growth during this volatile period highlights the firm’s resilience and continued investor confidence. Despite widespread losses in market value for many top firms, Infosys has managed to increase its position and deliver consistent results. This positive trajectory further solidifies Infosys' status as a key player in the global IT industry.","Infosys' market capitalization rose from Rs 8,03,440.41 crore to Rs 8.15 lakh crore in just five days.

Apple co-founder Steve Jobs talked about AI 40 years ago: Here’s a video,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-co-founder-steve-jobs-talked-about-ai-40-years-ago-heres-a-video/articleshow/114403621.cms,"This is what is he talks about AI

And so we’re finding the way we’ve built computers in the past isn’t working for the kinds of things we want to do in the future. And we’re examining new architectures, these fancy words like non–von Neumann machines, etcetera. And what we’re doing is we’re starting to look to the human brain. How is the human brain architected? And we’re finding that computers are very good at doing very simple things extremely accurately. And the human mind is very good at doing very complex things adequately. And there’s a ton of people now starting to look to the brain as a model of an architecture to build a computer.

The main differentiation that exists now between the two machines, and I’m going to use the word “machine” to describe the brain for a moment, is that man is self-conscious, obviously. We are conscious that we’re conscious: “I am thinking.” And to our knowledge, no computer or any even of the high primates has yet to say, “I am thinking.”

And so a tremendous amount of work is going on in the artificial intelligence community to try to understand what self-consciousness is, to try to understand if a computer can ever be self-conscious. But I think the biggest thing that motivates a lot of us is, unlike what we just heard, we don’t know. We honestly don’t know whether we are more than just a machine.

And we are building better and better computers. We’re running up against roadblocks. A lot of people are spending the best parts of their lives right now to try to understand the architecture of the brain and how we can make better and better machines to emulate it. And I actually think, by the end of our lifetimes, we’re going to know the answer to this question. And that’s what’s driving a lot of us.

While artificial intelligence as a technology may have picked up steam after the launch of ChatGPT two years ago, the concept is far from new. Apple founder Steve Jobs , a visionary in the tech world, predicted the potential of AI as far back as 40 years ago, envisioning machines that may answer questions and think like humans.On the Steve Jobs Archive , there’s footage from 1983 in which Jobs is talking to people at the International Design Conference in Aspen.The old video shows what Jobs thought about computers at that time, how books may be replaced by computers one day and the amount of work that is being done to understand the architecture of the brain to help machines emulate it.You can watch the video and a bunch of others using this link",Apple founder Steve Jobs predicted the potential of AI as far back as 40 years ago.

Positive but remains cautious

LTIMindtree, India's sixth-largest technology services company, is reportedly focusing on larger clients and leveraging artificial intelligence ( AI ) to secure significant market share. A company executive told Economic Times that LTIMindtree recently won its largest deal ever, a result of its AI-centric approach.Nachiket Deshpande, the company's chief operating officer, stated that AI is being integrated into all services.This strategic shift has led to a surge in large deals, including the record-breaking manufacturing contract . “We are now embedding AI into each of our service, reimagining with AI… Bulk of our large deals that we announced this quarter came because of that differentiated AI offering. This is one of our largest deals in the history of the company, that we signed with a manufacturing client,” said Deshpande in an interaction with ET.In the second quarter of fiscal year 2025, LTIMindtree secured several multi-year projects, including a $200 million deal from a U.S.-based manufacturer. Despite a slight decline in quarterly revenue , the company's large deal pipeline remains robust at over $5 billion.Deshpande explained that the AI-focused approach has enabled LTIMindtree to consolidate multiple vendors into a single provider. Additionally, the company is carefully evaluating smaller clients and may reduce its involvement if strategic improvements are not achieved.While cost reduction remains a significant driver of growth, Deshpande emphasized the company's focus on winning larger market share with existing clients.LTIMindtree, formed in 2022 from the merger of L&T Infotech and Mindtree, reported a 3.2% quarter-over-quarter revenue growth in the second quarter. Despite this positive trend, the company remains cautious about the outlook due to seasonal factors and potential macroeconomic challenges.The company's margin target of 17-18% may be delayed due to factors such as wage hikes and geopolitical tensions. Deshpande acknowledged these challenges but expressed confidence in the company's long-term growth prospects.","LTIMindtree is reportedly focusing on larger clients and leveraging artificial intelligence ( AI ) to secure significant market share.

AI is ‘going to amplify human intelligence’: Yann LeCun

Meta AI Studio arrives in India

Yann LeCun , vice president and Meta 's chief AI scientist, often referred to as one of the Godfathers of AI, discussed India’s role in the future of artificial intelligence (AI). Speaking at Meta’s first Build with AI Summit in Bengaluru, he said “India has an important role to play, not just in AI technology development for local products but also for the international market.” LeCun is on his third visit to India.He first came to Bengaluru in 2011, followed by his second visit to the country in early 2020 before the pandemic.Talking about the impact of AI on humanity, he said “AI is not going to dominate us or take over humanity, it’s going to amplify human intelligence.” LeCun said that he believes using AI assistants is like having a team of intelligent people at one’s disposal. “AI assistance might eventually be smarter than us, but we shouldn’t feel threatened by that and should feel empowered,” he said.“Open source is not just important today, it is going to become even more important in the future, where AI is going to become a common infrastructure that all of us across the world will share,” LeCun stated.At the event, the company has announced the launch of Meta AI Studio in India. Other than the US, India is one of the first countries to get access to it. The Meta AI Studio allows users to create Llama-powered AI avatars as per their liking. For example, Instagram creators can set up an AI as an extension of themselves that can quickly answer common DM questions and story replies with AI Studio.","Yann LeCun is often referred to as one of the Godfathers of AI.

Why this issue may have affected users



LinkedIn has resolved an issue that recently caused follower counts to drop for several users. The platform experienced widespread reports of users losing hundreds of followers within a short period, sparking speculation about a purge of fake accounts . Users took to the platform to express their concern, with some speculating about a crackdown on fake or inactive accounts.While LinkedIn did not explain the cause of the problem, the Microsoft-owned professional networking platform shared a post on X to confirm that the issue had been fixed.In the X post, LinkedIn wrote: “We heard some members may have seen a change in their connection and follower count . Our team quickly looked into this. We’re happy to report this has now been resolved.”According to a report by TechCrunch, the drop in LinkedIn follower counts sparked concern among users who rely on the platform for professional networking and marketing. This concern was amplified by LinkedIn's initial silence on the matter, as the company did not immediately acknowledge the issue on its social media channels.While speculation pointed to a purge of fake accounts, the lack of official communication fueled uncertainty and anxiety among users who depend on their LinkedIn profiles for professional visibility and business development, the report suggests.For example, the Elon Musk-owned social media platform has repeatedly run purges to remove spammers, bots, and inactive accounts from its platform. Similar purges were also carried out by other social networks as well.","LinkedIn has resolved an issue that recently caused follower counts to drop for several users.

What the UK minister said



“The vast majority of sensitive sites did not deploy such equipment and, of the small proportion that did, over 50% of sites have now had that equipment replaced. Work is pressing ahead to remove the remaining devices with approximately 70% of sites expected to have their surveillance equipment removed by the autumn.

The potential

national security

risks apply to specific on-board systems and therefore these risks are not exclusive to Chinese-made vehicles, or indeed only electric vehicles. The

cybersecurity

regulation sets out requirements to mitigate potential threats in vehicle construction, to monitor emerging threats and to respond to cyber-attacks.”

The UK government has removed over half of the Chinese camera maker Hikvision ’s surveillance cameras from sensitive government sites. According to a report by the UK Defence Journal, this move addresses concerns about potential security risks associated with Chinese-made technology. In a letter, a UK minister confirmed that efforts are underway to complete the removal process by April 2025.This initiative follows growing concerns about the use of Chinese technology in government buildings, particularly surveillance equipment and electric vehicles The minister notes that while a small number of sensitive sites initially deployed Hikvision equipment, over 50% have now replaced it. The remaining sites are expected to have the devices removed by autumn 2024, with complete removal targeted for April 2025. He also noted that the Cabinet Office is overseeing progress to ensure departments meet this deadline.In the letter to Lord Alton of Liverpool, UK minister Lord Coaker wrote:Apart from surveillance concerns, the UK government is also addressing potential security risks associated with connected and electric vehicles, particularly those manufactured in China. However, these risks are not exclusive to Chinese-made or electric vehicles, Coaker highlightedThe primary concern lies with specific on-board systems found in various types of connected vehicles. To mitigate these risks, the government is collaborating with national technical authorities like the National Protective Security Authority (NPSA) and the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) to understand and address cyber vulnerabilities.Furthermore, the UK is involved in international efforts to enhance vehicle cybersecurity. The Department for Transport also co-chairs a UN group responsible for developing international regulations on vehicle cybersecurity and software updates.",The UK government has removed over half of the Chinese camera maker Hikvision ’s surveillance cameras from sensitive government sites.

What the company said



“TSMC is a law-abiding company, and we are committed to complying with all applicable rules and regulations, including applicable

export controls

. We proactively communicated with the US Commerce Department regarding the matter in the report. We are not aware of TSMC being the subject of any investigation at this time.”

Why Huawei getting TSMC chips is a concern for US



Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co ( TSMC ) has reportedly halted shipments to a customer. According to a report by the news agency Reuters, the chip manufacturer made this decision after discovering that chips it produced for them ended up in Huawei Technologies products, potentially violating US sanctions . The chipmaker has already notified both US and Taiwanese authorities and is conducting an investigation for the same, the report suggested citing an official (who remained anonymous) familiar with the situation.However, the report didn’t reveal whether the alleged TSMC client knowingly supplied the chips to Huawei or where it's based.Earlier this month, TSMC notified US officials of a potential violation of export restrictions after TechInsights, a tech research firm, discovered one of TSMC's chips inside a Huawei product..TSMC, a major supplier of chips to Apple and other tech giants, is prohibited from directly supplying Huawei due to US sanctions that are aimed at curbing the Chinese tech giant's access to advanced technology.In an emailed statement to Bloomberg, TSMC said:TSMC's discovery of its chips in Huawei's AI servers raises concerns about how the Chinese tech giant obtained the advancedsemiconductors despite US sanctions. Huawei, blacklisted since 2020, is barred from doing business with TSMC without a US license.While Huawei has relied on SMIC, a local partner, for chip production, questions remain about SMIC's capabilities. TSMC claims it has not supplied Huawei since 2020, but the presence of its chips in Huawei's latest products suggests potential loopholes in the sanctions.Earlier this year, another Reuters report suggested that some Chinese entities have found ways to access advanced US chips and AI technology by using cloud services offered by companies like Amazon, despite the sanctions.","Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co ( TSMC ) has reportedly halted shipments to a customer.

Nvidia launched Blackwell AI chips earlier this year and said that these GPUs – dubbed ‘superchip’ – will be available by 2024-end. However, reports suggested that a design flaw in the units impacted its production. Company CEO Jensen Huang has now said that the flaw has been fixed.According to a report by news agency Reuters, Huang said that its longtime Taiwanese manufacturing partner TSMC helped the company fix the design flaw with its latest Blackwell AI.The flaw reportedly affected customers such as Facebook-parent Meta , Google and Microsoft .Huang said that Blackwell “had a design flaw”.“It was functional, but the design flaw caused the yield to be low. It was 100% Nvidia's fault. In order to make a Blackwell computer work, seven different types of chips were designed from scratch and had to be ramped into production at the same time,” he said.“What TSMC did, was to help us recover from that yield difficulty and resume the manufacturing of Blackwell at an incredible place,” the CEO added.Dismissing reports of tensions between Nvidia and TSMC caused by the delay in production, Huang said that those reports are “fake news”.According to Nvidia, Blackwell chips take two squares of silicon the size of the company's previous offering and bind them together into a single component that is 30 times speedier at tasks like serving up answers from chatbots.Huang is also visiting India in the coming days and recently, a report suggested that Nvidia is planning to develop an India-centric chip that will help services like Kawach system as well as help startups and businesses.",N Nvidia launched Blackwell AI chips earlier this year and said that these GPUs – dubbed ‘superchip’ – will be available by 2024-end.

What the IT guidelines say



Reactions to the new policy

Hong Kong is reportedly barring its government employees from using popular apps like WhatsApp, WeChat and Google Drive on their work computers. According to news agency AP, the ban comes amidst potential security risks. The Hong Kong government, as per the report, has issued IT security guidelines which have many civil servants complaining about added inconvenience.For those unaware, data breaches at various Hong Kong government departments earlier this year compromised the personal information of at least tens of thousands of people, sparking concerns.Issued by Hong Kong’s Digital Policy Office, the guidelines bar government workers from using apps like WhatsApp, WeChat and Google Drive on their official laptops/PCs. However, they will still be allowed to use the services from personal devices at work. The report says that government workers can get exceptions to the ban with approval from a manager.The report quotes Sun Dong, Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry, who said that the ban is needed as hacking is becoming a more serious problem. He said the governments of the United States and China have also adopted stringent measures for their internal computer systems.On the contrary, Anthony Lai, director of VX Research Limited, a Hong Kong and Britain-based cybersecurity firm said the government's approach is appropriate due to low cybersecurity awareness among some staff and a lack of comprehensive internal monitoring systems. The AP report further quotes an anonymous civil servant who said her office often uses cloud storage services to exchange large files with vendors outside the government.","Hong Kong is reportedly barring its government employees from using popular apps like WhatsApp, WeChat and Google Drive on their work computers.

Edtech giant Byju’s has ‘bad news’. In a significant ruling, the Supreme Court has overturned a previous decision that halted insolvency proceedings against Byju's . The court criticised the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal ( NCLAT ) for exceeding its authority and disrupting the established insolvency process.According to a report by news agency PTI, the Supreme Court emphasised that the NCLAT should not merely “rubber-stamp” withdrawal applications, but instead adhere to the proper procedures outlined in law.“The NCLAT cannot be considered a post office that merely puts a stamp on the withdrawal application submitted by the parties to the corporate insolvency resolution process (CIRP),” said the bench of Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud, and Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra.It added that the withdrawal plea should have been moved by the IRP (insolvency resolution professional) not by the corporate debtor or other parties.“As noted above, inherent powers cannot be used to subvert legal provisions, which exhaustively provide for a procedure to permit the NCLAT to circumvent this detailed procedure by invoking its inherent powers,” it said.The court also rejected Byju's settlement with the Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ), ordering the cricket board to deposit the settlement amount with a committee of creditors.Byju's faced insolvency proceedings after defaulting on asponsorship agreement worth Rs 158 crore with the BCCI. In August, the NCLAT halted these proceedings and approved a settlement between Byju's and the BCCI.The NCLT had initiated insolvency proceedings against Byju's in July after the BCCI filed a petition alleging default on the sponsorship payment. However, Byju's challenged the order, arguing that the company was solvent and willing to pay its dues.NCLAT then decided a timeline over payment of dues. The tribunal, however, warned that any default in the payment schedule would lead to the immediate revival of the insolvency proceedings.","Byju's faced insolvency proceedings after defaulting on asponsorship agreement worth Rs 158 crore with the BCCI.

Never download apps from unknown sources.

Be wary of requests for facial recognition or unusual verification methods.

Do not share sensitive information like credit card details or OTPs with strangers.

If unsure about lounge access procedures, contact the airport authorities directly.

A woman traveling through Kempegowda International Airport in Bengaluru became the victim of an elaborate scam, losing over Rs 87,000 in a fraud scheme linked to lounge access.The woman, identified as Bhargavi Mani, shared her ordeal in a now-viral video, raising awareness about the deceptive tactics employed by scammers. Mani explained that she couldn't find her physical credit card, so she tried to enter the airport lounge by presenting a photo of the card to the staff.Instead of traditional verification methods, the lounge staff reportedly directed Ms.Mani to download a specific app and complete a facial scan for ""security purposes."" Trusting the staff, Mani downloaded the app, later identified as ""Lounge Pass."" However, she opted not to use the lounge and decided to grab coffee at Starbucks instead.Later, Mani noticed she was unable to receive phone calls, initially attributing it to network issues. However, the situation turned alarming when she realised strangers were answering her calls. Upon investigation, Ms. Mani discovered unauthorised transactions totalling over Rs 87,000 had been made on her credit card, transferred to a PhonePe account.She suspects the downloaded app was a malware program that allowed the scammers to access her phone, redirect her calls, and intercept one-time passwords (OTPs) used for online transactions. Mani has since reported the incident to the cybercrime department, alerted her bank, and blocked her credit card to prevent further losses.","Bhargavi Mani lost over Rs 87,000 in a fraud scheme linked to lounge access.

India's captaincy under scrutiny



India Women and New Zealand Women are gearing up for a three-match ODI series in India, just two days after the conclusion of the 2024 Women’s T20 World Cup. New Zealand enters the series with high spirits, having claimed their first-ever T20 World Cup title, while India is looking for redemption after a disappointing group-stage exit in the same tournament.This ODI series will serve as a crucial warm-up for the upcoming Women’s ODI World Cup, which India is set to host in 2025.The White Ferns, fresh off their championship victory, will be full of confidence, especially after their dominant win over India in their T20 World Cup opener. On the other hand, India will aim to turn the tables and regain momentum ahead of the major tournament next year.New Zealand has included wicketkeeper Polly Inglis, who has received her maiden call-up for the series.

Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos to employees concerned about the company’s culture shift: It is both intentional and …,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/netflix-co-ceo-ted-sarandos-to-employees-concerned-about-the-companys-culture-shift-it-is-both-intentional-and-/articleshow/114492516.cms,"Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos has come out in defence of the recent changes to the company's influential culture memo , stating that evolution is necessary as the streaming giant grows beyond its startup roots.Speaking at The Wall Street Journal's Tech Live conference on Tuesday, Sarandos addressed employee concerns about shifts in company culture , emphasising that change is both intentional and essential.""We are constantly working on improving the culture,"" Sarandos said during the conference. ""And so when anyone says, 'Hey, the culture is changing.' Yes, of course it needs to.""The streaming service recently updated its famous culture deck in June, following a year-long process that incorporated feedback from 1,500 employees. The revision notably removed the ""freedom and responsibility"" section, replacing it with a new "" People Over Process "" framework that emphasises hiring highly responsible individuals who excel in open environments.""We definitely change the culture. We wanted to reflect how we work, not dictate how we work,"" Sarandos explained. He noted that Netflix founder Reed Hastings created the original culture memo when the company had fewer than 300 employees, saying it was ""perfectly suited"" for their needs at that time. However, with Netflix now employing 14,000 people and standing as the world's largest streaming platform, adaptation was necessary.Modifications include refinements to the company's "" Keeper's Test ,"" a management tool used to evaluate employee retention . The updated version now explicitly encourages regular communication between employees and managers about performance and workplace satisfaction.The culture memo, which former Meta COO Sheryl Sandberg once called ""the most important document ever to come out of the valley,"" maintains its core focus on attracting top talent and fostering high performance. However, Sarandos admitted that the original version may have overemphasised freedom at the expense of responsibility.Last year's update also addressed contemporary workplace concerns, adding sections on representation and artistic expression while maintaining the company's meritocratic principles. The document notably includes language supporting employee choice to leave if they object to content projects.","Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos defended recent changes to the company's culture memo.
