Assam CM urged people to to be alert

Assam police recently uncovered a Rs 2,200 crore stock market scam where a 22-year-old Bishal Phukan duped citizens on false promises of high investment returns . Now, Edelweiss Mutual Fund CEO and MD, Radhika Gupta has shared important advice for all the investors out there.Referring to the Rs 2,200 core trading scam, Gupta has advised the investors that there is no fast route to riches and one should stick to dal-chawal investing .“2200 crores of fraud is heartbreaking stuff. How many reminders do we need that there is no fast route to riches… and usually if such a route is advertised with fancy cars in tow… it leads to fatal crashes. Stay safe. And stick to dal-chawal investing. It works. Without indigestion,” said Gupta in a post on X (formerly known as Twitter).The ""dal-chawal"" funds mentioned by Gupta are well-diversified funds that invest in a wide range of sectors. They are designed to deliver steady returns, regardless of market volatility. Just like the Indian staple, these funds are reliable and less risky for investors.Meanwhile, Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma has urged the public to be alert against investing through brokers who do not follow due legal procedures.Highlighting that claims of doubling money with minimal effort are typically fraudulent, Sarma said “The promise of doubling your money with additional interest is a way of fraudsters.”“According to the law, no one is authorised to conduct stock broking in such a deceptive manner. They (certain apps) are completely unlawful. Today, the police have acted, and in the future, they will intensify it. There is a proper procedure for engaging in stock broking—such as opening a Demat account. These apps should be ignored. They lure people with attractive returns initially and then scam them. So, please stay away from these,” he advised.","Assam police recently uncovered a Rs 2,200 crore stock market scam where a 22-year-old Bishal Phukan duped citizens on false promises of high investment returns.

While investments in cybersecurity are on the rise, the availability of professional support for these activities remains limited, posing a significant hurdle for banks as they roll out digital systems.Speaking at FIBAC 2024, a banking summit organized by the Indian Banks’ Association and FICCI, Setty emphasized the importance of addressing these challenges to ensure the successful transition to digital technologies and protect systems from cyber threats.SBI has been able to create resilience in its systems while maintaining a positive customer experience, despite the complexities of integrating legacy systems with newer technologies. The bank has collaborated with fintech players and software solution providers to reimagine customer journeys and streamline processes.Setty also discussed the need for banks to prioritize spending on technology that delivers tangible benefits, such as meeting regulatory requirements, acquiring new business, and enhancing customer experience. He cautioned against excessive spending on technology upgrades that do not contribute to overall transformation.Investments in technology should focus on creating end-to-end experiences and processes that lead to operational efficiency. Additionally, banks should assess whether their digital interfaces are capable of handling large transaction volumes and consider redeploying staff to areas where they can contribute to business growth.By addressing these challenges and making strategic investments in technology, banks can effectively navigate the digital landscape and ensure the security and efficiency of their operations.","State Bank of India ( SBI ) Chairman CS Setty has warned of growing cybersecurity challenges and the need for improved digital literacy in the banking sector.

Social media reactions on Durov’s transformation

Impact of public scrutiny

Pavel Durov, CEO of Telegram , has recently become the subject of widespread speculation after older photos of him resurfaced online. These images have led many to wonder whether the billionaire entrepreneur underwent plastic surgery to enhance his appearance. Adding to the intrigue, Durov was recently arrested in France, raising further questions about the man behind the popular messaging app.Pavel Durov, a 39-year-old entrepreneur originally from Russia, is best known as the founder and CEO of Telegram, a messaging app launched in 2013.Telegram quickly gained popularity for its strong emphasis on user privacy, offering end-to-end encryption and other security features that set it apart from competitors. As of now, Forbes estimates Durov's net worth to be around $15.5 billion. Despite his success in the tech industry, Durov has managed to maintain a relatively low profile—until now.Durov's recent arrest in Paris has added a new layer of complexity to his public image. He was detained in France on charges of suspected complicity in running an online platform involved in illicit activities, including child exploitation, drug trafficking, and fraud. While these allegations are serious, it is the sudden focus on Durov's physical transformation that has captured the internet's attention.Pavel Durov has been active on social media platforms like Instagram since 2011, regularly sharing photos from his travels around the world. In his recent posts, Durov appears with a full head of hair and a toned physique, often posing shirtless in various locations. However, these recent images stand in stark contrast to older photos where Durov was seen with a noticeably receding hairline.The drastic change in his appearance has fueled rumours that Durov may have undergone plastic surgery, including a possible hair transplant. A popular post on X (formerly Twitter) by a well-known account shared a side-by-side comparison of Durov's old and new photos, sparking a flurry of online discussions. The post reads, ""Pavel Durov (Telegram CEO) before his hair transplant and plastic surgery,"" and has since gone viral.The speculation around Durov's transformation has been met with a variety of opinions online. On Reddit, users have debated whether the changes in Durov's appearance are the result of surgical procedures or simply better grooming and styling.One Reddit user commented, ""This isn't a hair transplant. His hair is too thick and full to have this kind of drastic change from a HT. Most likely he's wearing a hair system (wig).""Another user added, ""There's speculation that it's not a transplant, but rather a hair system because his hair loss was much more advanced in the first picture, so when the operation happens, the resulting hairdo never looks as full as his.""Some users believe the changes are the result of plastic surgery, with one theorising, ""This is well-done surgery.""However, not everyone is convinced that surgery is involved. One Reddit user opined, ""Honestly, I think a lot of the facial 'changes' are simply due to the much better angle and lighting in the second photo.""As the speculation continues, it's clear that Durov's transformation—whether natural or assisted—has caught the public's eye. The intense scrutiny of his appearance highlights the challenges that come with being in the spotlight, especially for someone as private as Durov. Whether or not he has undergone any procedures, the discussions around his looks reflect a broader societal fascination with image and success.","Pavel Durov, 39, is the founder and CEO of Telegram, a messaging app launched in 2013.

Elon Musk praised Ratan Tata

The legacy of the Tata Nano

Also read

In the realm of business and innovation, few figures command as much respect as Tata Group chairman emeritus Ratan Tata. His influence extends far beyond the Indian corporate world, even garnering admiration from Tesla CEO and X owner Elon Musk . In a 2009 interview with American journalist Charlie Rose , Musk praised Ratan Tata as a ""gentleman and a scholar."" This moment has recently resurfaced, shedding light on Musk's appreciation for Ratan Tata and his ambitious project, the Tata Nano .The Tata Nano was introduced by Tata Motors in 2008 as the world's cheapest car, with a price tag of just Rs 1 lakh (approximately $2,300 at the time). The car was a pet project of Ratan Tata, designed to make automobile ownership accessible to millions of Indians who had never been able to afford a car. The idea was revolutionary—a small, affordable car that would cater to the vast Indian middle class, providing them with a safe and efficient means of transportation.In the interview with Charlie Rose, which took place shortly after the launch of the Tata Nano, the Tesla CEO was asked about his views on Ratan Tata’s efforts to introduce a low-cost car in India. The interview clip, which has recently gone viral, captures Musk's candid response.""Take for a moment Ratan Tata, what he’s doing in India — developing a little sedan for $2300. Where do you put that in the whole equation of where the future of cars is?"" asked Rose.Musk responded with a mix of admiration and caution. He began by acknowledging the brilliance behind the Tata Nano project and the character of Ratan Tata himself.""I think it's a good idea to have affordable cars, but I think the problem with something like the Nano ... I wouldn't say problem because I think, by the way, it is probably a great idea and Ratan is a gentleman and scholar,"" Musk said.However, Musk also expressed his concerns about the long-term viability of such a low-cost vehicle, particularly in the context of rising fuel prices. He pointed out that while the initial purchase cost of the Nano was remarkably low, the cost of running the car—particularly fuel costs—could become a significant issue as gasoline prices continued to rise.""But where it’s going to become challenging in the future is when the price of gasoline rises, the cost of acquiring the car is much less of an issue than the cost of running the car,"" the billionnaire explained.Despite the initial excitement surrounding the Tata Nano, the car faced numerous challenges. One of the most significant issues was its branding. While the Nano was intended to be an affordable vehicle for the masses, it was often labeled as ""cheap"" rather than ""affordable."" This perception problem, combined with safety concerns and competition from other small cars, led to unimpressive sales figures.The Nano’s production was ultimately discontinued in 2018, marking the end of what was initially seen as a groundbreaking project. The car's journey from inception to discontinuation is often cited as one of the biggest marketing failures in the automobile industry.","The Tata Nano was introduced by Tata Motors in 2008 as the world's cheapest car, with a price tag of just Rs 1 lakh (approximately $2,300 at the time) The car was a pet project of Ratan Tata, designed to make automobile ownership accessible to millions of Indians who had never been able to afford a car.

Elon Musk criticizes Brazil ban on X



Delhi High Court warns Wikipedia

Ola CEO Bhavish Aggarwal has once again reiterated his stance on fostering the Indian technology sector. Aggarwal took to microblogging site X (formerly known as Twitter) to share his views on the latest report of Delhi High Court slamming Wikipedia over non-compliance with Indian laws.In the post, he wrote “Another proof of why we need to build our tech stack in India. These platforms don’t even comply with Indian laws and then even ignore court judgements!”.But he did not stop there.Aggarwal took aim at Elon Musk 's social media platform, Twitter, leveraging the Wikipedia incident to slam the platform. He said “Also, just look at Twitter’s arm twisting of the Brazilian Supreme Court .”“The more we ignore and justify, more we risk,” he further added.Recently, Brazil Supreme Court banned X after a protracted legal battle. The battle started in April this year when Judge de Moraes directed X to suspend several accounts alleged to be disseminating false information. X's refusal to follow this order resulted in the current suspension in addition to a penalty of 50,000 reais (approximately Rs. 7.47 lakh) for any efforts to bypass the ban, including the use of VPNs.Elon Musk reacted to the announcement with fury, dubbing Moraes as ‘evil dictator’.The Delhi High Court threatened Wikipedia to block the website if it doesn’t comply with India’s laws. Justice Navin Chawla delivered the warning during a hearing related to a defamation case filed by news agency ANI against Wikipedia.""If you don't like India, please don't work in India... We will ask government to block your site,"" Justice Chawla declared, as reported by legal news website Bar and Bench.","Ola CEO Bhavish Aggarwal took to X (formerly known as Twitter) to share his views on the latest report of Delhi High Court slamming Wikipedia over non- compliance with Indian laws.
