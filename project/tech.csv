"Amazon may launch another app in India, here’s why",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/amazon-may-launch-another-app-in-india-heres-why/articleshow/112640583.cms,"Amazon is exploring the possibility of launching a standalone app for its digital payments service, Amazon Pay , in India. The move aims to boost usage and visibility of the payment platform, which is currently integrated within Amazon's main e-commerce app in the country.Sources familiar with the matter told TechCrunch that Amazon has been contemplating this shift for about a year.The tech giant believes that separating Amazon Pay into its own app could help it gain wider recognition and increase user engagement.Amazon Pay offers a range of financial services in India, including money transfers, bill payments, insurance purchases, travel bookings, and investments in mutual funds and digital gold. However, these features are currently only accessible through Amazon's e-commerce app.The potential standalone app could give Amazon Pay a competitive edge in India's rapidly growing digital payments market. In July, Amazon Pay processed approximately 72.4 million transactions, accounting for about 0.5% of all transactions on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) network.If implemented, this move would align with broader industry trends. Flipkart , Amazon's chief rival in India, recently consolidated its fintech offerings into a single vertical, two years after separating from PhonePe .Amazon has already reached out to the National Payments Corporation of India ( NPCI ) for approval, according to one source. However, the plans are still in the discussion phase and could be altered or abandoned.This potential shift in strategy comes as Amazon continues to invest heavily in its Indian operations. In June, the company infused Rs 600 crore (approximately $72 million) into Amazon Pay India, bringing its total investment in the payments arm to Rs 1,950 crore.","Amazon is exploring the possibility of launching a standalone app for its digital payments service, Amazon Pay.

Second layoff in 2024

GoPro lays off 15% of its workforce this year, reported news agency Reuters. The popular action camera maker in a SEC filing said that it plans to cut its workforce as part of a restructuring plan to reduce operating expenses.“Restructuring Plan is anticipated to entail a reduction in force of approximately 15% from our ending second quarter headcount of 925 full-time employees beginning in Q3 2024,” the company said in the filing.The layoffs are expected to begin in the third quarter of 2024 and would be completed by the end of 2024. About 140 employees will be impacted by it.As part of the restructuring plan, the company expects to take charges in the range of $5 million to $7 million, with cash expenses of $1 million to be recognized in the third quarter and about $4 million to $6 million in the fourth quarter of 2024.This is the second time GoPro has announced job cuts in 2024. The company reduced its workforce by 4% in March earlier this year.GoPro had 925 full-time employees at the end of the second quarter ended June 30.Earlier this month, GoPro reported a revenue of $186 million for the second quarter, down 22.7% compared to last year. In May, the U.S. International Trade Commission launched a probe into GoPro's claims that patents for its cameras, systems and accessories were being violated by Chinese firm Arashi Vision.The tech industry continues to see job cuts in 2024.

GM recently faced a few software incidents

General Motors is laying off more than 1,000 salaried employees globally in its software and services division, the company confirmed on Monday. The job cuts , which include about 600 positions at GM's tech campus near Detroit, come as part of a review to streamline operations in the unit.""As we build GM's future, we must simplify for speed and excellence, make bold choices, and prioritise the investments that will have the greatest impact,"" GM said in a statement to CNBC.The layoffs represent approximately 1.3% of GM's global salaried workforce of 76,000 as of the end of last year. The cuts primarily affect the automaker's US operations. Impacted employees were notified Monday morning.""We are grateful to those who helped establish a strong foundation that positions GM to lead moving forward,"" the automaker added in its statement.""As a result, we're reducing certain teams within the Software and Services organisation,"" GM stated. The division, currently led by executives Baris Cetinok and Dave Richardson, covers areas such as vehicle infotainment, OnStar services, and GM's Super Cruise advanced driver-assist system.The change comes less than six months after leadership shifts in the unit, including the departure of former Apple executive Mike Abbott in March due to health reasons.The job cuts follow GM's efforts to reduce costs amid industry concerns of a potential downturn and significant investments in electric vehicles and software-defined vehicles. GM has recently faced challenges with software issues in its new Chevy Blazer EV, including blank infotainment screens and charging error messages. The company issued a stop sale notice last December due to these problems, which was lifted in March.The layoffs also come after GM cancelled its ""Ultra Cruise"" programme, a competitor to Tesla's Full Self-Driving system, in January. The company merged the FSD team with its regular Super Cruise team.Despite the layoffs and recent setbacks, the company says it continues to work on expanding its hands-free driving system, with plans to broaden its capabilities by the end of 2025.","GM is laying off more than 1,000 salaried employees globally in its software and services division.

Apple's in-house modem development continues despite setbacks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apples-in-house-modem-development-continues-despite-setbacks/articleshow/112633986.cms,"Apple is continuing its efforts to develop an in-house cellular modem , despite facing numerous challenges and delays, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman in his latest Power On newsletter. The tech giant's strategy focuses on long-term benefits rather than immediate improvements to its devices.For over a decade, Apple has relied on Qualcomm Inc. for modem chips, which are crucial for connecting iPhones and other devices to cellular networks.However, in 2018, amid a legal battle with Qualcomm, Apple began work on its own modem design.The project has encountered significant hurdles, including performance issues and overheating problems. As a result, Apple has been forced to push back the modem's debut until at least next year, with a gradual rollout expected to take several years. This setback led Apple to extend its supplier agreement with Qualcomm through March 2027.Despite these challenges, Apple is investing heavily in the project, dedicating billions of dollars and thousands of engineers to the effort. Gurman reports that even people within Apple acknowledge that customers may not notice a difference in user experience initially.The company's long-term vision includes integrating its modem design into a new wireless chip that would also handle Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity. This could potentially improve device reliability and battery life. There's also the possibility of incorporating all these functions into the device's main system on a chip (SoC), which could reduce costs and save space inside the iPhone.While the immediate benefits may not be apparent, Apple hopes this investment will set the stage for future innovations iniPhone design and functionality. The company has a track record of successfully developing custom silicon , including breakthrough processors for the iPhone, iPad, and Mac lineup.In addition to modem development, Gurman's newsletter reveals that Apple has been working on 6G technology for the past two years, although 6G deployment is not expected until at least 2030.As Apple continues to push forward with its in-house modem project, the company faces the challenge of balancing long-term strategic goals with the immediate need to maintain competitive devices in the market. The success of this endeavour could significantly impact Apple's future product designs and its relationships with current suppliers like Qualcomm and Broadcom.","The tech giant's strategy focuses on long-term benefits rather than immediate improvements to its devices.

Why this US woman's resignation letter on Reddit is going viral,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-this-womans-resignation-letter-on-reddit-is-going-viral/articleshow/112630549.cms,"Lack of communication one of the reasons

Safety concerns were a major point of contention

How people reacted to her post

A woman employee resigned from her position, citing that her manager’s micromanagement, stifled communication and a disregard for employee safety as key reasons for the departure. In an email to her manager, the employee detailed their growing dissatisfaction with the work environment and said that the manager wanted “robots, but we are people.” The letter has been posted by the employee on Reddit , garnering much support from the community.The woman, who worked as a housekeeper , accused the manager of micromanaging their tasks, leading to anxiety and a sense of being constantly monitored. The comments suggest that this happened in the US.“I have never sent an employer such an email, but I am very hurt. This job was one of the best I have had, yet my manager managed to suck the spirit out of me and I grew to hate it with a passion. I was a housekeeper mainly, and often wasn't provided the supplies to do my job,” she says in the post.The employee stated that communication with coworkers was discouraged, resulting in a lonely work environment. They also criticised the perceived lack of value placed on employee input during staff meetings.“We have had multiple bedbug outbreaks, and my manager failed to follow the protocol and would send me into an infested room to clean anyway and would just say ‘make sure you disinfect really well, and when you get home just drop your clothes at the door and put them into the wash’. She was a micromanager to the extreme, but I did not want to go into every little detail as it was unnecessary,” she added.The employee also expressed frustration at the lack of basic cleaning supplies.“Multiple employees, myself included, had spoken to her in person about the cleaning supplies and the bedbug issue and nothing changed. Our best employees quit over a month ago due to her poor management as well. She wants robots, but we are people. I started another job where I won't have to worry about this anymore,” she added.""We work in a building full of sick children and we go above and beyond to make sure we keep things clean for them, but I felt there was a complete disregard of safety when it came down to the people keeping it clean for those children,"" the email reads.The employee expressed regret for leaving a job they once enjoyed but felt unable to continue under the current conditions.You can read the full letter here An individual wrote, ""CC every email address in the company you can lay your hands on.

Security flaw in Microsoft's macOS apps may allow hackers to spy on users,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/security-flaw-in-microsofts-macos-apps-may-allow-hackers-to-spy-on-users-claims-researchers/articleshow/112630001.cms,"How these security flaws can impact users



What Microsoft said about these security flaws



Security features in macOS



Researchers have allegedly discovered multiple security flaws in the Microsoft apps available for macOS . These vulnerabilities could potentially allow attackers to secretly access users' cameras and microphones, steal sensitive data and compromise system security.According to a report by Cisco ’s cybersecurity arm Talos , eight vulnerabilities have been identified in popular Microsoft apps including Word, Outlook , Excel, OneNote and Teams which are also available for MacOS.The impact of these vulnerabilities varies depending on the apps and their permissions. For example, Microsoft Teams, a popular tool for professional communication, could be exploited to record conversations or access sensitive data. Similarly, Microsoft Outlook could be used to send unauthorized emails, potentially leading to data breaches, the report notes.Researchers have also identified that these apps use a feature known as the com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation entitlement. This feature disables a critical security function, allowing unsigned or untrusted libraries to be loaded, making the applications susceptible to library injection attacks.Microsoft has also acknowledged the vulnerabilities identified in the report but considers them low-risk. In response, some apps, including Microsoft Teams, OneNote, and Teams helper apps, have been updated to remove this entitlement, thereby reducing their vulnerability.However, other apps like Microsoft Word, Excel, Outlook, and PowerPoint still retain this entitlement, leaving them vulnerable to attacks. Microsoft has reportedly ""declined to address these issues,"" citing the need for their apps to load unsigned libraries to support plugins.Apple's macOS is designed with a layered security model to safeguard users from unauthorised access and data breaches. A key component of this model is the Transparency, Consent, and Control (TCC) framework, which regulates how apps can access sensitive data like the microphone, camera and location services.Furthermore, macOS implements Discretionary Access Control (DAC) policies, which enhance security by limiting access to specific resources based on user permissions.","Eight vulnerabilities have been identified in popular Microsoft apps including Word, Outlook, Excel, OneNote and Teams.

Tensor G4, Gemini and more AI inside

Upgraded cameras with the new 'Add me' AI feature for photos

Google has launched its second-generation Pixel foldable phone, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold , which is its first-ever foldable phone in India. The second-gen Pixel Fold upgrades on some salient aspects over the first one. Per Google, the foldable is slim, super durable, and has a brighter screen, both on the outside and inside. And, the phone also packs in Pixel’s “fastest, most powerful” Tensor G4 chip , bringing on-device multimodal capabilities to the phone.On the inside, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold comes equipped with an 8 inches ‘Super Actua Flex display,’ an LTPO panel with a 2922x1344 resolution at 486 PPI. The inner screen has a dynamic refresh rate of 1-120Hz and can go as bright as 3,000 nits, which Google says is 80% brighter than the screen on the first-gen Pixel Fold. To make use of phone’s large inner canvas, there’s a split-screen mode that’ll let you use two apps side-by-side.When unfolded, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold can be used a regular phone with a 6.3 inches outer screen, which has the same specs as the inner screen.Google says that the Pixel 9 Pro Fold has an “all-new” hinge that is made from stainless steel and has an aerospace grade aluminium alloy cover. The hinge has a polished finish, while the back has the silky matt finish. The phone is rated IPX8 for water resistivity. And there’s Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the outside.Powering the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is Google’s Tensor G4 chip, also found on the other three Pixel 9 phones. The chip comes paired with 16GB of RAM and up to 1TB storage. Then, there’s theTitan M2 security coprocessor , which enables multi-layer hardware security.There’s a 5,060mAh battery, which Google promises will last for over 24 hours and up to 100 hours with Extreme Battery Saver. The phone supports fast charging at 45W, which should fill up the battery up to 55% in about 30 minutes. FYI, the charger isn’t included in the box. The phone also supports Qi wireless charging and Battery Share, i.e., reverse wireless charging.Out-of-the-box the Pixel 9 Pro Fold will come with Android 14 . There’s the usual Google promise of 7 years of OS and security updates.Would it even be a Pixel phone, if there’s no AI in it. Well, there’s a whole lot of AI. For starters Gemini is there, and it works in split-screen mode, as well. One could ask Gemini to write stuff or even get info about whats’s on the screen or photos. Circle To Search is also there, ohh and this feature can help you check if an image has been created using AI.The new “Pixel-exclusive” AI feature to arrive is Pixel Screenshots. The feature could organise or recall things, like events and location, all you need to is ask the phone.Google is giving one year of the Google One AI Premium plan for free to those who’ll buy the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. So, that’ll give you access to Gemini Advanced, Gemini in Gmail and Docs, on top of 2TB of cloud storage.The Pixel 9 Pro Fold ditches the camera visor for a squircle module that houses a triple lens setup – a 50MP wide camera, a 48MP ultraide and a 48MP 5x telephoto camera. For selfies, there's a 42 MP front-facing camera on the inner screen and 10MP camera on the outside.The camera hardware has been only a part of Pixel’s camera, but it’s AI that completes it. There’s a long list of AI features that complements the camera hardware on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. The usual Super Res Zoom, Zoom Enhance, Video Boost, Face Unblur, Photo Unblur, Best Take, Magic Eraser, Audio Eraser, and Magic Editor makes their return. Well, Magic Eraser now has an a “reimagine” feature that Google says can give photos a “whole new look.”One new AI tool to come to Google’s Pixel 9 pro Fold is the “Add Me,” which as you’d image can add you to a picture. So, how does it work? Well, you take photo with the group, swap in yourself, and AI will merge the photos.Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold is priced in India at Rs 1,72,999 and will be available for purchase later this year. While it comes in two colours – Obsidian and Porcelain – it’ll be available only in Obsidian colour in India.","Google has launched its second-generation Pixel foldable phone, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold.

"CrowdStrike sued by fliers after Microsoft outage disrupted air travel, company responds",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/crowdstrike-sued-by-fliers-after-microsoft-outage-disrupted-air-travel-company-responds/articleshow/112304684.cms,"What CrowdStrike says

Delta Airlines seeks compensation for disruption

In mounting problems for CrowdStrike over Microsoft outage last month, the cybersecurity company being sued by air travellers in a latest move. According to a Reuters report, air travellers whose flights were delayed or cancelled on July 19 due to Microsoft Windows outage on July 19 have filed a class action against the company.The plaintiffs include three fliers who filed the lawsuit in the federal court, Austin, Texas.They blame CrowdStrike's negligence in testing and deploying its software for the outage. Adding further, they stated that as fliers scrambled to get to their destinations, many spent hundreds of dollars on lodging, meals and alternative travel, while others missed work or suffered health problems from having to sleep on the airport floor.The filers demand CrowdStrike to pay compensatory and punitive damages to anyone whose flight was disrupted.In a statement, CrowdStrike said ""We believe this case lacks merit and we will vigorously defend the company."" The US cybersecurity company also provided an identical statement in response to a shareholder lawsuit filed on July 31.Delta claims that it faced over 2,200 flight cancellations on July 19 alone, with more than 6,000 flights cancelled since then. The airline is now dealing with over 176,000 refund or reimbursement requests. The estimated cost of the outages could reach as high as $500 million.The company’s CEO Ed Bastian said last week the outage had cost the airline $500 million, adding that it plans to take legal action to get compensation from the cybersecurity firm.Microsoft outage on July 19 was caused by a faulty software update that impacted 8 million Windows computers worldwide. CrowdStrike has rejected Delta Airlines' claim stating that it is ""highly disappointed by Delta's suggestion that CrowdStrike acted inappropriately and strongly rejects any allegation that it was grossly negligent or committed misconduct.""","Air travellers whose flights were delayed or cancelled on July 19 have filed a class action against CrowdStrike.

Social media outrage on Sarah Sarosh's GRWM video

Sarah Sarosh’s apology

In the age of social media, influencers wield significant power to shape public opinion. And with this power they also have responsibility not only to the brands they promote but also to their followers', many of whom may trust them blindly. It appears that Sarah Sarosh, a fashion influencer with over 200K followers, forgot this very responsibility.In what can be called a repulsive post, Sarah Sarosh posted a video on the heinous Kolkata murder-rape case where she can be seen smiling and applying make-up.In one-minute-four-second video, which has now been deleted, she is promoting makeup products that she seemingly is endorsing, while a commentary on the brutal rape and murder case runs in the background. The video, criticised for being insensitive and out-of-touch, sparked widespread outrage across various social media platforms. Despite issuing an apology, the incident has ignited a broader conversation about the appropriateness of using certain social media formats to discuss such grave issues.The video in question was part of a ""Get Ready With Me"" (GRWM) series, a popular format where influencers apply makeup while engaging in conversation. In this particular video , Sarah Sarosh appeared cheerful and upbeat as she applied serums, face creams, and makeup, all while a voiceover narrated the harrowing details of a recent crime in Kolkata. The stark contrast between the lighthearted makeup tutorial and the grave subject matter led to an immediate backlash.The video has left users across platforms like Reddit, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram shocked at her insensitivity. One Reddit user commented, “This is so distasteful and insensitive. She will do anything for views,” reflecting a common sentiment that the video was made purely for attention, without regard for the gravity of the topic.Another user questioned the decision to pair such serious content with a GRWM format, saying, “At this point, these people’s accounts should be banned. If she really had to talk about this topic, she could’ve sat down rather than doing a GRWM. How are the audio and video related?”On X, one of the users labelled the video “Absolutely disgusting,” while another user lamented the lengths some influencers will go for likes, stating, “Looks like there’s no end to how low they can go for likes. Nothing is off limits. No basic human decency is required.”In response to the backlash, Sarah Sarosh took to Instagram Stories to issue a public apology. She explained that her intent had been to raise awareness about the crime while also addressing her beauty content, which she had already filmed months earlier. “I posted a GRWM reel yesterday which was shot 2 months ago with a voiceover on the current affairs of the rape & murder incident,” she wrote. Sarosh admitted that she did not realise how “tone deaf” the video would appear, acknowledging that the mismatch between the content of the video and the subject of the voiceover was a grave error.Sarosh also shared her immediate reaction upon receiving negative comments, revealing that she deleted the video within five minutes of posting it. “The comments made me realise instantly that the messaging is distasteful from my end,” she said. “I deeply apologise for my actions to all those who have come across the content through screen recordings of my deleted content being circulated on other platforms.”","Sarah Sarosh, a fashion influencer with over 200K followers, posted a video on the heinous Kolkata murder-rape case where she can be seen smiling and applying make-up.

The new offering promises lightning-fast 8-16 minute deliveries for a diverse range of products, spanning from groceries to electronics.With this move, Flipkart directly challenges established players in the booming quick commerce sector, including Swiggy's Instamart, Zomato's Blinkit , Zepto , and BigBasket's BB Now.The service, which was previously offered on a trial basis to employees at Flipkart's headquarters, is now available to users through the Flipkart app.We confirmed the service's availability by checking an address in HSR on the Flipkart app, which indeed showed Flipkart Minutes as an option for quick delivery. Additionally, several users on X (formerly Twitter) reported that Flipkart is delivering groceries and other items to their addresses in Bengaluru within minutes through the ""Minutes"" service.Sources familiar with the matter tell the Economic Times that Flipkart plans to expand the service to more areas in Bengaluru over the next few weeks.The launch of Flipkart Minutes comes at a time when other players in the quick commerce space are aggressively expanding their operations.The ET had earlier reported that Flipkart was planning to operate around 100 dark stores to bolster its quick-commerce offerings during the upcoming festive season. Dark stores, which are mini warehouses strategically located for rapid deliveries, have become a crucial component of quick commerce operations.Blinkit, for instance, recently announced ambitious plans to increase its dark store count to 2,000 by 2026. This doubles down on its earlier announced plans to have 1,000 dark stores by March 2025. Similarly, Zepto aims to double its network to 700 dark stores by March 2025. Swiggy Instamart , another major player, currently operates more than 500 such warehouses.Interestingly, Amazon, a key player in the e-commerce space, has not shown interest in the quick-commerce business in India so far. However, it does operate a grocery store service dubbed "" Amazon Fresh ,"" offering same-day delivery for groceries. This is similar to what Flipkart has also been offering through its Grocery tab.","Flipkart has launched its quick commerce service'Flipkart Minutes'in select areas of Bengaluru.

California man credits Apple Watch for saving his life: ‘I wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for this little device’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/california-man-credits-apple-watch-for-saving-his-life-i-wouldnt-be-here-if-it-wasnt-for-this-little-device/articleshow/112306053.cms,"Apple Watch detects user’s low heart rate



What doctor said

An Apple Watch user is crediting the smartwatch for saving his life after the wearable alerted him about a life-threatening condition. Peter Moore , a resident of Montecito, California shared his experience with a local news publisher KTLA. Narrating the incident, he said “I wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for this little device”.Moore, who is a former tech executive, said that he was on his way to the airport when he began to feel “a little lightheaded and a little faint”.“Like a typical male, I thought, ‘I’ll go to Starbucks. That’ll fix it,'” Moore explained before he received a notification from the Apple Watch he was wearing.“My phone started to ping and said ‘low heart rate,’ which I’d never seen before. And so I looked at it… my heart rate had dropped to 32. And it was insistent in its notifications that something wasn’t right,” said Moore. He then contacted his wife who took him to hospital.“The doctor kind of theatrically ran in and said, ‘This is not good. This is not good. You need a pacemaker right now,'” Moore said.Omid Yousefian, the cardiac electrophysiologist at Sansum Clinic Cardiology who treated Moore said “Yes, his watch had a big role in saving his life”.“These days, 25% of the population over the age of 40 … have a high chance of experiencing atrial fibrillation,” Yousefian explained.“For us physicians, symptoms are the most important thing. [Moore] was notified by his watch that his heart rate is slow and he correlated that with the symptoms that he had. So he didn’t wait. He didn’t sit. He came to the hospital directly. So he made a very smart move,” Yousefian told the publication.","Peter Moore, a former tech executive, was on his way to the airport when he began to feel “a little lightheaded and a little faint” He received a notification from the Apple Watch he was wearing that his heart rate had dropped to 32.

What exactly happened

Read the complete post here

In a shocking incident, a Supreme Court lawyer, Mukul P Unny , was scammed out of Rs 38,000 while attempting to exchange his iPhone 13 for an iPhone 15 on Amazon .in. The lawyer detailed his ordeal on social media, highlighting the fraudulent tactics employed by the delivery executive.Unny took X (formerly known as Twitter) to post about the new kind of smartphone exchange scam.The incident occurred on July 21, 2024, when Unny placed an order for the iPhone 15 on Amazon. The following day, a delivery executive arrived at his residence and handed over the new phone after receiving the necessary OTP. However, the executive then requested another OTP, claiming it was required to complete the exchange.Despite Unny's hesitation, he was convinced to return the new iPhone to the delivery executive after speaking to the latter's supervisor.Unny contacted Amazon customer care the following day to report the incident. Initially, Amazon assured him of a refund if the product was not delivered. However, subsequent inquiries revealed the case was under investigation with a resolution deadline of July 31.On July 31st, Amazon concluded its investigation and informed Unny that a refund was impossible. The company's explanation lacked substance, as they had not thoroughly verified the scam details. The fact that Unny still possessed his old iPhone directly contradicted Amazon's claim that the exchange was complete.While Amazon has eventually issued a refund to Unny, his ordeal underscores the considerable risks inherent in online transactions, even when dealing with reputable platforms like Amazon.Always verify the identity of a delivery executive before sharing your Amazon OTP. This crucial step can protect you from falling victim to scams.“This is the story of my worst experience with @amazonIN On 21.07.2024, I ordered iPhone 15 from Amazon in exchange for my iPhone 13. On 22.07.2024, the delivery executive came at around 930 PM. I gave the OTP and took the product, and gave my phone to the executive.He said I have give another OTP. I had already given the OTP and was wondering what other OTP is to be given for exchange. I said I dont have any other OTP than the one I have given. He stayed there for few minutes & then called his supervisor.After speaking with the supervisor, the delivery exec asked for return of the product since the ""exchange is not final"".I insisted that I speak with the supervisor. The supervisor tells me that the exchange is done by a different team & requests for the product to be returned. I said I cannot give away the product especially since the OTP is given and the app was showing that the product is delivered. But this supervisor Ashok (8076650306) requested me to return, lest his team will have to make for the loss.Upon his request and assurance that the product will be ""reattempted"" the next day, I gave the product to the delivery exec (Vishal 8826421956) after taking the supervisor's and the delivery exec's number. On 23.07.2024, I spoke with the Amazon Customer Care and raised a complaint to which I assured that refund will be initiated if the product is not delivered. Call centre asked me to follow up on 25.07.2024.On 26.07.2024,when I called them, the customer case asked me to wait till 31.05.2024 as ""it has to be investigated"".
