“Find out the stress when [this] load is applied to throw the hammer. What is the stress at the handle of the hammer which has a diameter of 5/8 in.""

Engineering meets Hollywood

Do you need to watch Hollywood movies to be an engineer? It seems so. Cracking an IIT exam paper is no easy feat, but what students certainly didn't anticipate was a question referencing pop culture. It's as unexpected as the iconic scene in 'Avengers: Endgame' where Captain America wields Thor’s mighty hammer, Mjolnir. You read that right! A physics exam paper from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Varanasi recently featured a 10-mark question using this climactic battle scene as an example.A viral photo recently made rounds on the internet showing the exact frame when Captain America catches the Mjolnir.The question then asks the students toThe question continues:In one of scenes in the previous Avengers movies, a vibranium-based android Vision that has Tony Stark’s AI model J.A.R.V.I.S. as its core tells Thor about how his hammer is so “terribly well-balanced”.The fusion of engineering with a Hollywood action sequence has sparked excitement among fans and students. Some fans playfully expressed their desire to take such an exam, while others compared this unexpected blend of movies and academics to their own version of the ""Multiverse of Madness.""",A physics exam paper from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Varanasi recently featured a 10-mark question using this climactic battle scene as an example.

Specific Skills, Higher Demand

Apprenticeships on the Rise

Salary Stagnation for Standard Degrees

What Companies Are Doing

The big message for BTech graduates

The game has changed for fresh engineering graduates in India. Companies are looking beyond just a B.Tech degree. According to a report in Economic Times, ""‘Extra’ is now the new byword in hiring of engineering freshers as campus recruiters vie for candidates who have that little extra topping on their plain vanilla B.Tech degree. This topping could be a skill in emerging technologies like AI, ML or IoT, or an apprenticeship or internship at some firm.""The report claims that this trend is reflected in salaries.While the average starting package for engineers has remained flat for standard BTech graduates in recent years, those with additional skills are seeing a significant boost – a 10% increase reported by staffing firm TeamLease .""Those who've actively learned new technologies or gained experience through apprenticeships are not only getting hired faster, but also commanding higher salaries,"" told Krishna Vij, business head of IT staffing at TeamLease Digital, to ET.The numbers speak for themselves. The average salary for a fresh engineer is Rs 3.8-4.5 lakh per year, but for those with skills in emerging technologies, it jumps to Rs 7-10 lakh annually.Universities are adapting to this new normal. Campuses are buzzing with companies seeking ""knowledgeable and well-trained"" graduates, as highlighted by Harish Kumar, head of mechanical and aerospace engineering at the National Institute of Technology , Delhi.These sought-after candidates have either completed internships lasting 6-12 months, undergone specialized training, or tackled real-world projects in areas like data science, AI/ML, or cybersecurity. Companies are willing to pay a premium for this experience, offering salaries 75% to 150% higher than those without such exposure.Specific skills are in high demand at some universities. Amity University, for example, reports a surge in interest for students with expertise in cloud computing solutions like AWS, service management tools like ServiceNow, and cybersecurity. ""Students with a B.Tech in Cybersecurity are fetching a CTC (cost-to-company) exceeding Rs 15 lakh, while the average salary for a general B.Tech graduate is Rs 6 to 6.5 lakh per year,"" says Anjani Bhatnagar, the university's technical placement head.A similar story unfolds at SRM Institute of Science and Technology. Their Career Centre Director, N Venkata Sastry, observes a significant rise in recruitment by global capability centers, particularly those seeking graduates with specializations in new technologies. ""These skills are a clear differentiator for employability, and the salaries reflect that,"" he adds.Data from staffing firms like Xpheno and Quess confirms this trend. Kapil Joshi, deputy CEO at Quess IT Staffing, attributes the rise in apprenticeship hiring to companies' desire to reduce costs, build skilled talent pools, and foster employee loyalty. Quess data shows a staggering 10x increase in apprenticeship hiring by IT companies in the eight months leading up to August 2024 compared to the same period in 2023.Looking back, Xpheno's research reveals that average salaries for fresh engineers have seen only a small increase in the past decade, moving from Rs 3-3.4 lakh per year in 2013-14 to Rs 3.8-4.5 lakh in 2023-24. ""Average fresher salaries remain below Rs 5 lakh per annum in the Indian IT sector,"" says Prasadh M S, head of workforce research at Xpheno. Offers ranging from Rs 3.8 to 4.5 lakh are most common, with some even falling below Rs 3.5 lakh.While major IT companies like Cognizant , HCLTech, Infosys, and TCS did not respond to inquiries, Wipro provided details on their ""Work Integrated Learning Programme (WILP)"" for BSc and BCA graduates. This program combines studies with practical experience through Wipro's academies, and successful graduates have the opportunity to become full-time employees.The message for fresh engineering graduates is clear: A basic B.Tech degree is no longer enough. Equipping yourself with in-demand skills or real-world experience can significantly boost your employability and earning potential. So, take that extra step, gain that extra edge, and stand out from the crowd.","According to a report in Economic Times, 'Extra' is now the new byword in hiring of engineering freshers.

Elon Musk praised Ratan Tata

The legacy of the Tata Nano

Also read

In the realm of business and innovation, few figures command as much respect as Tata Group chairman emeritus Ratan Tata. His influence extends far beyond the Indian corporate world, even garnering admiration from Tesla CEO and X owner Elon Musk . In a 2009 interview with American journalist Charlie Rose , Musk praised Ratan Tata as a ""gentleman and a scholar."" This moment has recently resurfaced, shedding light on Musk's appreciation for Ratan Tata and his ambitious project, the Tata Nano .The Tata Nano was introduced by Tata Motors in 2008 as the world's cheapest car, with a price tag of just Rs 1 lakh (approximately $2,300 at the time). The car was a pet project of Ratan Tata, designed to make automobile ownership accessible to millions of Indians who had never been able to afford a car. The idea was revolutionary—a small, affordable car that would cater to the vast Indian middle class, providing them with a safe and efficient means of transportation.In the interview with Charlie Rose, which took place shortly after the launch of the Tata Nano, the Tesla CEO was asked about his views on Ratan Tata’s efforts to introduce a low-cost car in India. The interview clip, which has recently gone viral, captures Musk's candid response.""Take for a moment Ratan Tata, what he’s doing in India — developing a little sedan for $2300. Where do you put that in the whole equation of where the future of cars is?"" asked Rose.Musk responded with a mix of admiration and caution. He began by acknowledging the brilliance behind the Tata Nano project and the character of Ratan Tata himself.""I think it's a good idea to have affordable cars, but I think the problem with something like the Nano ... I wouldn't say problem because I think, by the way, it is probably a great idea and Ratan is a gentleman and scholar,"" Musk said.However, Musk also expressed his concerns about the long-term viability of such a low-cost vehicle, particularly in the context of rising fuel prices. He pointed out that while the initial purchase cost of the Nano was remarkably low, the cost of running the car—particularly fuel costs—could become a significant issue as gasoline prices continued to rise.""But where it’s going to become challenging in the future is when the price of gasoline rises, the cost of acquiring the car is much less of an issue than the cost of running the car,"" the billionnaire explained.Despite the initial excitement surrounding the Tata Nano, the car faced numerous challenges. One of the most significant issues was its branding. While the Nano was intended to be an affordable vehicle for the masses, it was often labeled as ""cheap"" rather than ""affordable."" This perception problem, combined with safety concerns and competition from other small cars, led to unimpressive sales figures.The Nano’s production was ultimately discontinued in 2018, marking the end of what was initially seen as a groundbreaking project. The car's journey from inception to discontinuation is often cited as one of the biggest marketing failures in the automobile industry.","The Tata Nano was introduced by Tata Motors in 2008 as the world's cheapest car, with a price tag of just Rs 1 lakh (approximately $2,300 at the time) The car was a pet project of Ratan Tata, designed to make automobile ownership accessible to millions of Indians who had never been able to afford a car.

What she wants in a husband

Online reactions and viral response

Also read

A woman’s detailed list of requirements for a future husband has gone viral on social media, sparking widespread reactions. Her profile, shared on X (formerly known as Twitter), includes her own personal details such as her salary, education, and a bold set of expectations for her ideal partner. The unusual demands have generated a mixture of amusement, criticism, and debate among users online.The woman, who earns Rs 1.3 lakh per annum and holds a Bachelor of Education (B.Ed) degree, has raised eyebrows by seeking a techie groom with an annual income of Rs 30 lakh.She further outlined her preferences, stating that her ideal partner should be settled in India, the US, or Europe and should own a spacious 3BHK home. Her love for luxury is evident in her desire to travel frequently and stay in 5-star hotels, which she expects to continue after marriage.The post was shared on X with the caption, “Her qualities and salary. Expected husband’s qualities and salary,” emphasising the stark difference between her modest income and her high expectations for a spouse.Beyond financial expectations, the woman’s list includes several personal and lifestyle requirements. She currently lives with her parents, whom she describes as dependent on her, and expects her future husband to accommodate them in a large independent house. She also made it clear that she is not willing to take on traditional household chores due to her professional commitments, and therefore, she expects her partner to provide a full-time cook and maid.Moreover, she expressed her passion for travel, stating that her husband should share her enthusiasm for exploring the world. She also mentioned that she does not believe in joint family living arrangements and expects her in-laws to reside separately.The profile has garnered over 1.2 million views and has sparked a lively conversation on social media. Many users were shocked by the wide gap between her salary of Rs 1.3 lakh and her demand for a partner earning Rs 30 lakh. Some users questioned the feasibility of her lifestyle expectations, pointing out the disparity between her income and her desire for luxury experiences like 5-star hotels.One user humorously remarked, “She makes Rs 11,000 a month, but she wants a full-time maid and cook? Talk about next-level priorities!” Another comment highlighted the irony, stating, “132000 per annum salary and her hobby is 5-star hotels? And surprise me with Louis Vuitton—that was the highlight.""Others were puzzled by her specific relationship expectations, such as her demand for an unmarried man despite her being divorced, and her insistence that her parents live with her while her in-laws live separately. One user commented, “She’s divorced but wants an unmarried man. Her parents will stay with her, but no in-laws allowed—how fair is that?”While the post has mostly drawn criticism and amusement, it has also led to broader discussions about societal expectations in marriage. Some users defended the woman’s right to have her own preferences, with one person writing, “Everyone is entitled to have their own expectations, but they should be realistic about what they offer in return.” However, the majority of responses leaned towards disbelief, with one user summing up the sentiment by saying, “She will be single if she continues like this.”","A woman's detailed list of requirements for a future husband has gone viral on social media.

Spam and phishing message menace grows in India

What the government’s directive says

Bharti Airtel CEO Gopal Vittal has written a letter to the heads of Reliance Jio , Vodafone Idea , state-run Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd ( BSNL ) and Tata Teleservices, says a report in the Economic Times. In the letter, Vittal proposed creating a collaborative system for sharing information about corporate connections used for commercial calling. This collaborative approach is aimed to monitor and prevent the misuse of these connections.""We are ready to take the first step and share the data (entity name and active numbers only) in the same template on a monthly basis and we would appreciate your support,"" Vittal said in the letter.The letter was sent to Reliance Jio MD Pankaj Pawar, Vodafone Idea CEO Akshaya Moondra, BSNL CMD Robert Ravi and Tata Teleservices MD Harjit Singh Chauhan.""As the telecom industry continues to face the growing challenge of UCC , it has become clear that despite ongoing efforts, more robust and unified mechanisms are required to protect our customers from this persistent issue,"" Vittal said in the letter. He also stressed that in line with the directives of Trai and DoT, the focus remains on finding effective solutions to curb UCC.UCC in the telecom industry means Unsolicited Commercial Communications that describes the combination of communications and collaboration technologies.""We strongly believe that tackling this issue should be a joint endeavour among all telecom operators, rather than isolated efforts,"" he said.Telecom operators must take ""collective responsibility"" in preventing UCC by ensuring that their networks are not exploited by spammers, especially through corporate connections that may be unintentionally facilitating such activities, he said.""Today, enterprise customers are served by multiple operators, and we are seized of the fact that any independent efforts to address spam may not be in the best interests of customers, as it may impact the quality and continuity of services,"" Vittal added.According to industry data, 1.5-1.7 billion commercial messages are sent every day in India, taking the total to about 55 billion every month.

In another survey, 76% consumers said that they get three or more spam messages daily.

The business would have amounted to fabricating thousands of silicon wafers a month, two sources told Reuters.The loss represents a missed opportunity for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger 's turnaround plan, which centred on creating a foundry unit. Gelsinger announced plans for Intel's contract manufacturing effort in 2021 and formally launched it in February 2024.According to Reuters, the deal fell through due to disagreements over profit margins, despite months of negotiations that included meetings between the CEOs, executives, and dozens of engineers from both companies.Sources said winning the PlayStation 6 chip contract would have provided Intel with a steady stream of business, potentially occupying its foundry unit for over five years. The deal could have also helped attract other major clients to Intel's advanced 18A manufacturing process.The setback comes at a challenging time for Intel, which recently announced plans to cut 15% of its workforce and reduce capital spending on factory expansion. The company reported $7 billion in operating losses for its manufacturing businesses in the first quarter of this year.Sony has not yet officially announced the PlayStation 6. The company recently unveiled the PlayStation 5 Pro and reported sales of 20.8 million first-generation PlayStation 5 systems in fiscal 2023.Typically, Sony consoles sell more than 100 million units across half a decade.

What users can do

Hackers have reportedly infected over 1.3 million TV streaming boxes that are running on software based on Android Open Source Project ( AOSP ) that allows developers to create custom variants of the Android OS for their own devices. Google has also said that the infected devices are not running Android TV.According to a report by France-based cybersecurity company Doctor Web , hackers have installed a new Vo1d backdoor malware that allows them to take full control of the devices.“Doctor Web experts have uncovered yet another case of an Android-based TV box infection. The malware, dubbed Android.Vo1d, has infected nearly 1.3 million devices belonging to users in 197 countries. It is a backdoor that puts its components in the system storage area and, when commanded by attackers, is capable of secretly downloading and installing third-party software.The largest number of infections have been detected in Brazil, Morocco, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Russia, Malaysia, Algeria and Indonesia.The cybersecurity company explains that there are multiple variants of the malware that are used to infect systems depending on the version of software they are running. They all can download and run executables when commanded to monitor specified directories. Another versionResearchers believe these software versions have been targeted because they commonly run outdated software with vulnerabilities.""One possible infection vector could be an attack by an intermediate malware that exploits operating system vulnerabilities to gain root privileges. Another possible vector could be the use of unofficial firmware versions with built-in root access,” the company says.To prevent infection by this malware, users can check for and install new firmware updates as they become available. These boxes must be disconnected from the internet in case users see any unexpected activity. Users are also advised to not install Android applications as APKs from third-party sites on Android.Google has also clarified that the infected devices are not running Android TV.“These off-brand devices discovered to be infected were not Play Protect certified Android devices. If a device isn't Play Protect certified, Google doesn’t have a record of security and compatibility test results.

Used PUBG chatrooms to communicate

In a disturbing development, militants in Swat , Pakistan, reportedly employed tactics inspired by the popular video game PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG) to carry out an attack on a local police station. According to a report in news agency ANI, the militants utilised PUBG 's in-game chat rooms to communicate and coordinate their activities, making it difficult for authorities to track their movements.This use of technology allowed them to evade electronic surveillance and plan their attack with relative ease.On August 28, the Banr police station in Swat came under attack, resulting in the death of one police officer and injuries to two others. Following the incident, a thorough investigation was launched by district police.Initial analysis of CCTV footage led investigators to believe that a hand grenade was used in the attack. However, further investigation revealed that the militants had instead employed an improvised explosive device (IED) constructed from a power bank.Dr Zahidullah , the district police officer of Swat, disclosed that the militants had used PUBG as a tool for training and motivation. The game's chat rooms provided a secure platform for communication, enabling them to maintain contact with their group members and families in Afghanistan.Through investigation, authorities identified one suspect and subsequently apprehended several others with connections to a local militant group led by Murad alias Rehmatullah, affiliated with the bannedTehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan .The arrested suspects revealed that they used PUBG chat rooms to communicate with their group members and families in Afghanistan. To avoid detection, they frequently changed their mobile phones and SIM cards.Dr Zahidullah noted that the families of the arrested militants, who had fled to Afghanistan during Operation Rah-i-Rast in 2009, remain involved in militant activities. Approximately 2,000 families of militants from Swat are believed to be residing in Afghanistan.","Militants in Swat, Pakistan, employed tactics inspired by the popular video game PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG) to carry out an attack on a local police station.

How the users reacted to the post

Mahindra Group chairman, Anand Mahindra recently shared an observation on social media : he encountered a traffic jam in Venice, Italy, that reminded him of the chaotic traffic in Mumbai. However, to his surprise, he found the Venetian traffic jam to be less stressful.Mahindra posted a 30-second video of the Venetian canal filled with boats, highlighting the resemblance to Mumbai's busy roads.He noted that despite the congestion, the atmosphere in Venice was far more relaxed and enjoyable compared to the hectic pace of Mumbai's traffic.“Traveled all the way to Venice only to run into a Mumbai-style traffic jam! (Ok, I admit this traffic pile-up is less stressful…)”, wrote Mahindra in a post shared on X (formerly known as Twitter).Agreeing with Mahindra, X users also started sharing their own experiences of traffic jams in different cities. Here are some of the user reactions:‘In monsoons, you can visit Delhi instead of Venice. You will get a similar experience at a fraction of the cost.‘That’s a humorous way to put it!

Future of AI Robotics

Hans Peter Brondmo, former CEO of Google's robotics moonshot project Everyday Robotics recently wrote in Wired about why he thinks that building AI-powered robots that can flexibly operate in the real world is going to take much longer than Silicon Valley believes and promises. ""As the head of Alphabet’s AI-powered robotics moonshot, I came to believe many things.For one, robots can’t come soon enough. For another, they shouldn’t look like us,"" he wrote. Started in 2016, Google scrapped Everyday Robotics last year (February 2023).Brondmo wrote that he joined X, Alphabet’s secret innovation lab, in early 2016. The project, under the leadership of Astro Teller, aimed to create AI-powered robots that could assist humans in everyday tasks. My involvement was driven by a belief in Google's potential to make a significant impact on the world. The company's commitment to long-term, ambitious projects, and its ability to invest heavily in research and development, made it an ideal environment for such a venture. ""My job: help figure out what to do with the employees and technology left over from nine robot companies that Google had acquired,"" he said.Google X was established with the goal of addressing global challenges through innovative technologies. Projects were required to meet specific criteria, including addressing a significant problem, utilizing groundbreaking technology, and offering a radical solution. Google founder Larry Page — favored moving directly to ""end to end"" (e2e) learning, where you'd hand robots a general task and they'd be able to figure out how to execute it. That, Page felt, was a goal worthy of a moonshot. But it also turned out to be out of reach. ""I have come to believe,"" Brondmo writes, ""it will take many, many thousands, maybe even millions of robots doing stuff in the real world to collect enough data to train e2e models that make the robots do anything other than fairly narrow, well-defined tasks....""Creating robots capable of assisting humans in everyday environments presented numerous challenges. These included developing AI systems that could understand and respond to complex real-world situations, designing robots that were safe and efficient, and addressing the ethical implications of artificial intelligence. Training AI models to perform complex tasks requires vast amounts of data. This is particularly challenging for robotics, as robots need to learn from real-world experiences in order to develop the skills necessary to navigate and interact with their surroundings.Brondmo wrote that his mother had advanced Parkinson's disease, and hoped that one day robots could support her. ""Our frequent conversations toward the end of her life convinced me more than ever that a future version of what we started at Everyday Robots will be coming. In fact, it can't come soon enough.The future of robotics is promising, but it will require continued investment in research and development, as well as a focus on long-term goals. By addressing the challenges and opportunities presented by this technology, we can create a future in which robots play a valuable role in our lives. ""Eight and a half years later—and 18 months after Google decided to discontinue its largest bet in robotics and AI—it seems as if a new robotics startup pops up every week. I am more convinced than ever that the robots need to come. Yet I have concerns that Silicon Valley, with its focus on “minimum viable products” and VCs’ general aversion to investing in hardware, will be patient enough to win the global race to give AI a robot body . And much of the money that is being invested is focusing on the wrong things,"" Brondmo said.","Hans Peter Brondmo, former CEO of Google's robotics moonshot project Everyday Robotics, wrote in Wired.

‘FakeUpdates’ is August’s ‘most dangerous’ malware in India: These sectors most targeted,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/fakeupdates-is-augusts-most-dangerous-malware-in-india-these-sectors-most-targeted/articleshow/113367254.cms,"How these malwares work and how to safeguard

Most ‘targeted’ industries in India

Ransomware remains a major concern in India, with RansomHub leading the pack, a report has said, adding that the ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) has rapidly expanded since rebranding from Knight ransomware, impacting over 210 victims globally. The report also revealed that FakeUpdates is the most used malware to target organisations.According to Check Point Software 's August 2024 Global Threat Index, reveals that this malware has impacted 8% worldwide organisations, followed by Androxgh0st with a global impact of 5%, and Phorpiex with a global impact of 5%.FakeUpdates: It is a downloader written in JavaScript. It essentially disguises itself as a software update, but it's actually carrying a bunch of harmful programs (malware) hidden inside. Once the user “accepts” this fake update, it unpacks and instals those nasty programs on your computer, causing all sorts of trouble.Androxgh0st: It is a botnet that targets Windows, Mac, and Linux platforms. It breaks into computers by finding weaknesses (vulnerabilities) in software the users might be using. Once inside, it steals important information like logins for different online services, email settings and even cloud storage keys.Phorpiex: It is another botnet known for distributing other malware families via spam campaigns – by sending out tons of spam emails with infected attachments or links. It's also known for helping with ""sextortion"" scams, where hackers try to blackmail people by threatening to release embarrassing information about them.The report says that in India, the healthcare sector remains the most targeted, followed by education/research and government/military sectors.“Organisations in India are experiencing a significantly higher attack rate, averaging 3244 attacks per week in the past six months compared to the global average of 1657 attacks per organisation,” the report added.Check Point also said that Meow – a new ransomware variant has shifted its focus from encryption to data theft and extortion, selling stolen information on leak marketplaces.","Ransomware remains a major concern in India, with RansomHub leading the pack.

Tech billionaire returns to Earth after first ever commercial spacewalk: Why it matters for Elon Musk’s space company,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/tech-billionaire-returns-to-earth-after-first-ever-commercial-spacewalk-why-it-matters-for-elon-musks-space-company/articleshow/113367801.cms,"Why SpaceX’s Polaris Dawn mission is important for Elon Musk

Tech billionaire Jared Isaacman and his crew, aboard SpaceX 's Dragon capsule , successfully returned to Earth on Sunday (September 15) after a five-day stay in space. A part of SpaceX’s Polaris Dawn mission, this is historic because two members of the group conducted the world’s first private spacewalk.NASA lauded the Polaris Dawn mission – which concluded with a splashdown off Florida's coast and was streamed live by Elon Musk 's company SpaceX – as “a giant leap forward” for the commercial space industry.Last week on September 12, Isaacman and SpaceX engineer Sarah Gillis conducted the first-ever commercial spacewalk.“Splashdown of Dragon confirmed! Welcome back to Earth,” SpaceX said in a post on XBoth of them tested SpaceX's new spacesuits during the nearly two-hour-long spacewalk.“Commander @rookisaacman conducting suit mobility tests while Dragon flies between Australia and Antarctica,” Elon Musk-owned company posted a clip last week.Musk has also been sharing videos of the mission on his X handle as he is directly involved in the mission.The Polaris Dawn mission is part of a larger initiative by Isaacman, founder of Shift4 Payments , to push private spaceflight boundaries.""Back at home, we all have a lot of work to do, but from here — it looks like a perfect world,” Isaacman said.His second SpaceX mission set a new altitude record and underscored the growing capabilities of private space exploration. The Polaris Dawn mission achieved a peak altitude of 875 miles (1,408 kilometres), which surpasses the International Space Station (ISS) and the Hubble Space Telescope.It is noteworthy that this altitude is the highest reached since NASA's Apollo moon missions. Two more Polaris missions are planned, including the first manned flight of SpaceX's Starship rocket , currently under development.","Jared Isaacman and his crew, aboard SpaceX's Dragon capsule, successfully returned to Earth on Sunday (September 15) after a five-day stay in space.
