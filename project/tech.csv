Here’s his full post shared on Telegram

Thanks everyone for your support and love!

Last month I got interviewed by police for 4 days after arriving in Paris. I was told I may be personally responsible for other people’s illegal use of Telegram, because the French authorities didn’t receive responses from Telegram.

This was surprising for several reasons:

1. Telegram has an official representative in the EU that accepts and replies to EU requests. Its email address has been publicly available for anyone in the EU who googles “Telegram EU address for law enforcement”.

2. The French authorities had numerous ways to reach me to request assistance. As a French citizen, I was a frequent guest at the French consulate in Dubai. A while ago, when asked, I personally helped them establish a hotline with Telegram to deal with the threat of terrorism in France.

3. If a country is unhappy with an internet service, the established practice is to start a legal action against the service itself. Using laws from the pre-smartphone era to charge a CEO with crimes committed by third parties on the platform he manages is a misguided approach. Building technology is hard enough as it is. No innovator will ever build new tools if they know they can be personally held responsible for potential abuse of those tools.

Establishing the right balance between privacy and security is not easy. You have to reconcile privacy laws with law enforcement requirements, and local laws with EU laws. You have to take into account technological limitations. As a platform, you want your processes to be consistent globally, while also ensuring they are not abused in countries with weak rule of law. We’ve been committed to engaging with regulators to find the right balance. Yes, we stand by our principles: our experience is shaped by our mission to protect our users in authoritarian regimes. But we’ve always been open to dialogue.

Sometimes we can’t agree with a country’s regulator on the right balance between privacy and security. In those cases, we are ready to leave that country. We've done it many times. When Russia demanded we hand over “encryption keys” to enable surveillance, we refused — and Telegram got banned in Russia. When Iran demanded we block channels of peaceful protesters, we refused — and Telegram got banned in Iran. We are prepared to leave markets that aren’t compatible with our principles, because we are not doing this for money. We are driven by the intention to bring good and defend the basic rights of people, particularly in places where these rights are violated.

All of that does not mean Telegram is perfect. Even the fact that authorities could be confused by where to send requests is something that we should improve. But the claims in some media that Telegram is some sort of anarchic paradise are absolutely untrue. We take down millions of harmful posts and channels every day. We publish daily transparency reports (like this or this ). We have direct hotlines with NGOs to process urgent moderation requests faster.

However, we hear voices saying that it’s not enough. Telegram’s abrupt increase in user count to 950M caused growing pains that made it easier for criminals to abuse our platform. That’s why I made it my personal goal to ensure we significantly improve things in this regard. We’ve already started that process internally, and I will share more details on our progress with you very soon.

I hope that the events of August will result in making Telegram — and the social networking industry as a whole — safer and stronger. Thanks again for your love and memes 🙏

Time wrote “Anil Kapoor won a landmark victory in a New Delhi high court in September over unauthorized AI use of his likeness. “Every actor has the right to protect themselves,” Kapoor told Variety.”The actor, who starred in the Oscar-winning movie Slumdog Millionaire and many Bollywood films, took up the case after a large number of distorted videos, gifs, and emojis bearing his likeness began circulating online.Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw and actor Anil Kapoor are joined by Infosys co-founder Nandan Nilekani.“Nilekani, the billionaire co-founder of Infosys, has spent fifteen years in and out of government developing digital public infrastructure for the world’s most populous country, earning him nicknames like “India's Bill Gates”,” Time wrote about Nilekani.“And like many other tech billionaires, Nilekani, 69, is optimistic about AI’s potential, but has thoughts on how to ensure the technology’s rewards are distributed widely,” it added.Kalika Bali – Principal Researcher, Microsoft Research India was also named in the Time 100 Most Influential People in AI list. At Microsoft Research, the big tech company’s R&D subsidiary, Bali is working to ensure that the AI boom is inclusive of marginalized languages.

A US musician has reportedly used artificial intelligence ( AI ) tools to create fake songs, streamed them on services like Spotify , Apple Music and Amazon Music through fake listeners and collected $10 million in royalties. He has now been indicted on federal charges of defrauding the streaming services .According to a report in The New York Times, 52-year old Michael Smith used AI to create hundreds of thousands of fake songs under fictitious band names.He then employed bots to artificially inflate the play counts of these AI-generated tracks, raking in royalties over a seven-year period.The report says that the indictment revealed artist names such as “Callous Post,” “Calorie Screams” and “Calvinistic Dust” and song titles like “Zygotic Washstands,” “Zymotechnical” and “Zygophyllum” that were top performers on the three streaming services.As many as 10,000 fake profiles were established with the help of co-conspirators. Smith reportedly spread the streams across many songs in a bid to avoid any unusual spikes in listenership. These fabricated creations managed to climb the charts on major streaming platforms, diverting royalties that should have gone to legitimate artists.A US attorney condemned Smith's actions, emphasising the harm caused to genuine musicians and songwriters who were robbed of their rightful earnings.“Smith stole millions in royalties that should have been paid to musicians, songwriters, and other rights holders whose songs were legitimately streamed,” the US attorney said.Smith faces charges of wire fraud and money laundering conspiracy, each carrying a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. He was arrested on Wednesday.The indictment said that Smith was called out by a distribution company that suspected him of fraud in 2018. However, the musician denied doing anything wrong, saying: “This is absolutely wrong and crazy! … There is absolutely no fraud going on whatsoever!”","US musician used AI to create fake songs and stream them on streaming services.

"Why Infosys co-founder Narayana Murthy told a 12-year-old that I do not want you ""to become like me ...""",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-infosys-co-founder-narayana-murthy-told-a-12-year-old-that-i-do-not-want-you-to-become-like-me-/articleshow/113104660.cms,"Former Infosys CEO shares five invaluable lessons from his life experiences

Infosys co-founder NR Narayana Murthy shared a profound message with young students during Teach for India's Leaders earlier this week. In response to a student's question about achieving his level of success, Murthy emphasized the importance of personal growth and contribution to society. Rather than seeking to emulate him, he encouraged students to strive for greater achievements for the betterment of their nation.When a 12-year-old student asked Murthy, ""What should we do to become like you?"" Murthy replied: ""I do not want you to become like me...I want you to become better than me for the greater good of the nations.""During his hour-long session where Murthy addressed students of classes 7 and 8 at Mount Everest School, former Infosys CEO shared five invaluable lessons from his life experiences.He began by recounting his humble beginnings and the discipline instilled in him by his father. Murthy emphasized the significance of time management and continuous improvement, which played a pivotal role in his academic success.His mother's influence led to another important lesson: the joy of giving. Murthy shared a personal anecdote about sharing his scholarship money with his brother, inspired by the selfless act of Karna from mythology. This experience taught him the value of compassion and generosity.Murthy also highlighted the importance of citizenship and responsibility. He recalled a lesson from his headmaster about treating shared resources with care and respect. This principle has guided his approach to founding and running Infosys.Teamwork and leadership were additional themes emphasized by Murthy. He shared a story about a mistake he made during his time at IIM-Ahmedabad and the valuable lesson he learned about separating the person from their actions. He also stressed the importance of taking responsibility for failures and sharing successes with one's team. Recounting his Paris days, when his team was developing an advanced operating system, Murthy said: ""One Friday evening, I made a critical mistake, while testing a programme, which erased the entire memory off the computer. I had 24 hours to fix everything or the project would face severe delays."" He called his boss, Colin, who immediately came to help. After 22 hours, Murthy restored the system. ""Colin praised my dedication, but didn't mention his own sacrifice. He taught me a crucial leadership lesson: take full responsibility for failures and share the glory with your team. These lessons remain invaluable even today,"" concluded Murthy.In conclusion, Murthy defined success as the ability to bring joy to others. His inspiring message resonated with the young students, encouraging them to pursue their own paths and make a positive impact on the world.","Former Infosys CEO NR Narayana Murthy shared five invaluable lessons from his life experiences.

""RBI Kehta Hai”

Since almost a decade India's apex bank has been running a campaign ""RBI Kehta Hai” which aims to sensitise bank users to NOT share their ATM/credit/debit card PINs, OTP, CVV and UPI-PIN with anyone whatsoever.

Indians lost over Rs 1,750 crore to cybercrime in first 4 months of 2024 – and counting

Earlier this week, Bold Care co-founder Rahul Krishnan shared his debit card details including expiry and CVV online. He went on to promise that he will also share OTPs for people to make transactions. ""my card number is 4216-8701-5010-2349 the expiration date is 12/30 the security code is 207 happy sextember everyone! 🥳🥳,"" wrote Krishnan in a post on X, formerly Twitter.He did set a transaction limit of less than Rs 1000.Little doubt his post went viral. From the posts shared online, people used his the card details to make purchases of up to Rs 1,000 across online platforms: From Grofers to Swiggy, Amazon, Meesho and Zomato. There were also some who reportedly tried their luck at transactions bigger than Rs 1000, but yes didn't succeed,Rahul Krishnan has not revealed the reason behind his Santa Claus act or should we call it the ‘Bold stunt’. However, as many social media users pointed out in their comments: What appears to be a marketing campaign for Bold Care breached basic credit card security rules: Do not share Passwords, PIN, OTP, CVV, Card details with anyoneWhile ‘ RBI Kehta Hai ’ is an initiative of the Reserve Bank of India to educate the public about its regulations which are aimed at enhancing the quality of customer service in Banks, one of its key message is also to make banking customers aware against financial frauds.To drill the message Reserve Bank of India has roped in celebrities across industries, including Bollywood superstar Amitabh Bachchan, cricketer.Some users wrote in comments that what Krishnan did is a criminal offence under RBI. While sharing OTP is not a criminal offence, customers lose almost all their right to contest a financial fraud after they have shared the OTP. In a country where financial digital illiteracy is still quite low and OTP/UPI PIN cyber frauds rampant, such 'Bold stunts' may not be the right message to send.To give some numbers to how grave the cybercrime problem in India is: Indians lost more than Rs 1,750 crore to cyber criminals in the first four months of 2024 with over 7 lakh 40 thousand cybercrime complaints being registered on the National Cybercrime Reporting Portal run by the ministry of home affairs between January to April 2024. According to Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C), on an average 7,000 cybercrime complaints were registered per day in May 2024, a jump of 113.7% between 2021-2023 and 60.9% from 2022-2023, and 85%of them were financial online frauds. Those unaware, I4C is a body established by the MHA to provide a framework for law enforcement agencies to deal with cybercrime.","Bold Care co-founder Rahul Krishnan shared debit card details including expiry and CVV online.

Swedish telecom operator Telia has announced plans to cut around 15% of its workforce as part of a cost-saving initiative. The company aims to reduce annual costs by 2.6 billion Swedish crowns ($253 million) in response to declining ad sales and economic pressures.CEO Patrik Hofbauer acknowledged the difficult nature of the decision but emphasized its necessity for Telia's long-term success.""This is a tough decision, but one that is necessary to ensure the long-term success of Telia,"" CEO Hofbauer said. ""We need to be much more simpler in the way we operate, faster on decision making, and also when it comes to commercial execution, and we need to create more margin,"" Hofbauer said in an interview.""We are changing the operating model ... we are putting much more responsibility and accountability into the countries, because there we meet our customers,"" he told Reuters.The job cuts will impact approximately 1,400 employees in Sweden, with the remaining reductions distributed across other countries.Telia, which employs around 18,000 people and 1,370 consultants, plans to complete the layoffs by December 1.

Pavel Durov, CEO of Telegram , has recently become the subject of widespread speculation after older photos of him resurfaced online. These images have led many to wonder whether the billionaire entrepreneur underwent plastic surgery to enhance his appearance. Adding to the intrigue, Durov was recently arrested in France, raising further questions about the man behind the popular messaging app.Pavel Durov, a 39-year-old entrepreneur originally from Russia, is best known as the founder and CEO of Telegram, a messaging app launched in 2013.Telegram quickly gained popularity for its strong emphasis on user privacy, offering end-to-end encryption and other security features that set it apart from competitors. As of now, Forbes estimates Durov's net worth to be around $15.5 billion. Despite his success in the tech industry, Durov has managed to maintain a relatively low profile—until now.Durov's recent arrest in Paris has added a new layer of complexity to his public image. He was detained in France on charges of suspected complicity in running an online platform involved in illicit activities, including child exploitation, drug trafficking, and fraud. While these allegations are serious, it is the sudden focus on Durov's physical transformation that has captured the internet's attention.Pavel Durov has been active on social media platforms like Instagram since 2011, regularly sharing photos from his travels around the world. In his recent posts, Durov appears with a full head of hair and a toned physique, often posing shirtless in various locations. However, these recent images stand in stark contrast to older photos where Durov was seen with a noticeably receding hairline.The drastic change in his appearance has fueled rumours that Durov may have undergone plastic surgery, including a possible hair transplant. A popular post on X (formerly Twitter) by a well-known account shared a side-by-side comparison of Durov's old and new photos, sparking a flurry of online discussions. The post reads, ""Pavel Durov (Telegram CEO) before his hair transplant and plastic surgery,"" and has since gone viral.The speculation around Durov's transformation has been met with a variety of opinions online. On Reddit, users have debated whether the changes in Durov's appearance are the result of surgical procedures or simply better grooming and styling.One Reddit user commented, ""This isn't a hair transplant. His hair is too thick and full to have this kind of drastic change from a HT. Most likely he's wearing a hair system (wig).""Another user added, ""There's speculation that it's not a transplant, but rather a hair system because his hair loss was much more advanced in the first picture, so when the operation happens, the resulting hairdo never looks as full as his.""Some users believe the changes are the result of plastic surgery, with one theorising, ""This is well-done surgery.""However, not everyone is convinced that surgery is involved. One Reddit user opined, ""Honestly, I think a lot of the facial 'changes' are simply due to the much better angle and lighting in the second photo.""As the speculation continues, it's clear that Durov's transformation—whether natural or assisted—has caught the public's eye. The intense scrutiny of his appearance highlights the challenges that come with being in the spotlight, especially for someone as private as Durov. Whether or not he has undergone any procedures, the discussions around his looks reflect a broader societal fascination with image and success.","Pavel Durov, 39, is the founder and CEO of Telegram, a messaging app launched in 2013.

Bengaluru-based fabric startup, Reshmandi laid off its entire staff

ShareChat cuts 5% jobs

Tech companies continued to cut jobs at a rapid pace in August 2024. More than 27,000 workers in the industry lost their jobs as big tech companies like Intel , IBM , Cisco , and even smaller startups, comprising a total of over 40 companies announced layoffs. So far in 2024, over 136,000 tech workers have been laid off by 422 companies.Intel announced it would lay off 15,000 employees, representing over 15% of its workforce, in a memo to employees on Thursday.The layoffs are part of a $10 billion spending reduction plan for 2025, following a dismal second-quarter earnings report and outlook.CEO Pat Gelsinger blamed Intel’s revenue growth shortfall on high costs and low margins, despite its leadership in the CPU chip revolution 25 years ago. Annual revenues fell $24 billion between 2020 and 2023, while its workforce grew 10% during the same period.Cisco Systems is laying off about 7% of its global workforce, affecting around 6,000 employees, as it shifts focus to high-growth areas like AI and cybersecurity. This marks Cisco’s second major round of job cuts this year.CEO Chuck Robbins remains optimistic about rebounding demand for Cisco’s networking equipment. Cisco is pivoting to capitalise on emerging technologies, having committed $1 billion to invest in AI startups and recently acquired cybersecurity firm Splunk for $28 billion.As part of the restructuring, Cisco plans to combine its networking, security, and collaboration departments into a single organisation.IBM is discontinuing its research and development operations in China, resulting in the displacement of over 1,000 employees as reported by Chinese media outlet Yicai.IBM has been grappling with a decline in demand for IT hardware and difficulties in expanding its presence in China, a market that once held significant potential and provided a robust business base beyond the United States. Despite these challenges, IBM has affirmed that these changes will not compromise its ability to support customers in China. The company will now prioritise serving private enterprises and select multinationals within the Chinese market.Infineon, a German chipmaker, will cut 1,400 jobs and relocate another 1,400 to countries with lower labour costs, its CEO Jochen Hanebeck said. The company’s third-quarter revenue fell short of expectations, prompting a downgrade of its full-year forecast for the third time in months. Hanebeck attributed the slow recovery in target markets to prolonged weak economic momentum and excess inventory levels.Popular action camera manufacturer GoPro has announced a restructuring plan that involves reducing its workforce and eliminating approximately 15% of its current headcount, about 14o employees. The layoffs are expected to be completed by the end of 2024, reducing operating expenses by $50 million from projected fiscal 2024 expenses. Apple has laid off about 100 employees in its services group, primarily impacting the Apple Books app and Apple Bookstore teams. Engineering roles were also eliminated. The layoffs come as Apple shifts resources towards AI programs, viewing Apple Books as less of a priority. Despite the cuts, Apple News remains a key focus.Layoffs are uncommon at Apple, but this is not the first round. Earlier this year, Apple laid off about 600 employees in its Special Projects Group due to project closures. In January, Apple shuttered a 121-person AI team in San Diego. As of its latest filing, Apple reported 161,000 full-time equivalent employees. Apple declined to comment on the layoffs.Dell Technologies is reorganising its sales teams, including a new AI-focused group. Sales executives Bill Scannell and John Byrne wrote in a memo that Dell is becoming leaner by streamlining management and reprioritizing investments. Rumours are that the company laid off about 12,500 employees, or 10% of its worldwide workforce, but the same could not be confirmed.ReshaMandi has reportedly terminated its entire workforce, as reported by sources to Entrackr. The firm’s website has been inaccessible for a week, coinciding with the resignation of its auditor. “It’s all over for ReshaMandi,” a source told the outlet. “The company is struggling to pay liabilities and bear operational costs including salaries for the past several months.”Brave, a web browser and search startup, has laid off 27 employees across departments, as confirmed by TechCrunch. PitchBook estimates Brave has around 191 employees, representing a 14% reduction. These layoffs follow a similar move in October 2023, when Brave cut 9% of its workforce due to cost management in a challenging economic environment.ShareChat, a Bengaluru-based social media company, laid off about 5% of its workforce, about 30-40 employees, after a bi-annual performance review in the month of August 2024.","Intel announces 15,000 job cuts as chipmaker goes through toughest time in its history.

When Tesla CEO Elon Musk called Ratan Tata a “gentleman and …”,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/when-tesla-ceo-elon-musk-called-ratan-tata-a-gentleman-and-/articleshow/112903343.cms,"Tata Nano and the Indian automobile market

Elon Musk praised Ratan Tata

The legacy of the Tata Nano

Also read

In the realm of business and innovation, few figures command as much respect as Tata Group chairman emeritus Ratan Tata. His influence extends far beyond the Indian corporate world, even garnering admiration from Tesla CEO and X owner Elon Musk . In a 2009 interview with American journalist Charlie Rose , Musk praised Ratan Tata as a ""gentleman and a scholar."" This moment has recently resurfaced, shedding light on Musk's appreciation for Ratan Tata and his ambitious project, the Tata Nano .The Tata Nano was introduced by Tata Motors in 2008 as the world's cheapest car, with a price tag of just Rs 1 lakh (approximately $2,300 at the time). The car was a pet project of Ratan Tata, designed to make automobile ownership accessible to millions of Indians who had never been able to afford a car. The idea was revolutionary—a small, affordable car that would cater to the vast Indian middle class, providing them with a safe and efficient means of transportation.In the interview with Charlie Rose, which took place shortly after the launch of the Tata Nano, the Tesla CEO was asked about his views on Ratan Tata’s efforts to introduce a low-cost car in India. The interview clip, which has recently gone viral, captures Musk's candid response.""Take for a moment Ratan Tata, what he’s doing in India — developing a little sedan for $2300. Where do you put that in the whole equation of where the future of cars is?"" asked Rose.Musk responded with a mix of admiration and caution. He began by acknowledging the brilliance behind the Tata Nano project and the character of Ratan Tata himself.""I think it's a good idea to have affordable cars, but I think the problem with something like the Nano ... I wouldn't say problem because I think, by the way, it is probably a great idea and Ratan is a gentleman and scholar,"" Musk said.However, Musk also expressed his concerns about the long-term viability of such a low-cost vehicle, particularly in the context of rising fuel prices. He pointed out that while the initial purchase cost of the Nano was remarkably low, the cost of running the car—particularly fuel costs—could become a significant issue as gasoline prices continued to rise.""But where it’s going to become challenging in the future is when the price of gasoline rises, the cost of acquiring the car is much less of an issue than the cost of running the car,"" the billionnaire explained.Despite the initial excitement surrounding the Tata Nano, the car faced numerous challenges. One of the most significant issues was its branding. While the Nano was intended to be an affordable vehicle for the masses, it was often labeled as ""cheap"" rather than ""affordable."" This perception problem, combined with safety concerns and competition from other small cars, led to unimpressive sales figures.The Nano’s production was ultimately discontinued in 2018, marking the end of what was initially seen as a groundbreaking project. The car's journey from inception to discontinuation is often cited as one of the biggest marketing failures in the automobile industry.","The Tata Nano was introduced by Tata Motors in 2008 as the world's cheapest car, with a price tag of just Rs 1 lakh (approximately $2,300 at the time) The car was a pet project of Ratan Tata, designed to make automobile ownership accessible to millions of Indians who had never been able to afford a car.
