The move helped them gain some traction, and as per the latest numbers shared by Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella , the company’s search engine has logged 40% increase in users on a year-over-year basis.Microsoft’s earnings for the quarter that ended on March 31 was all about how AI helped the company to expand its business footprint.During the earnings call , Nadella said that Microsoft Bing surpassed 140 million daily users milestone – which is a 40% hike from last year when Microsoft announced Bing AI for the first time.The AI-infused search engine has seen a massive jump with the introduction of Copilot , which helped it cross 100 million daily users back in March 2023.

What Google CEO

Sundar Pichai

said in email to employees

A group of workers at Google have filed a complaint with the US labour board claiming that the tech company unlawfully fired about 50 employees for protesting its cloud contract with the Israeli government. Google employees fired for protesting the company's contract with Israel have filed the complaint with the National Labor Relations Board ( NLRB ). The workers allege that Google violated their labour rights by terminating their employment.The single-page complaint filed with the US Labor Relations Board alleges that by firing the workers, Google interfered with their rights under US labour law to advocate for better working conditions.The fired workers claim they weren't engaging in political debate, but discussing work conditions related to building software sold to governments like Israel's. They believe this discussion is protected activity under the National Labor Relations Act.“That’s legally protected activity,” one of the fired software engineers told ITPro Today. “Sundar can say he doesn’t want that, but the National Labor Relations Act says otherwise. Google is probably the most powerful company in the world, and the work the workers do every day has an incredible impact. To pretend it’s objective and you can’t talk about the effects of that is absurd,” he added.In the document filed with the US labour board, and obtained by The Washington Post, the workers specifically say that Google violated their rights “by terminating and/or placing them on administrative leave in response to their protected concerted activity, namely, participation (or perceived participation) in a peaceful, non-disruptive protest that was directly and explicitly connected to their terms and conditions of work.”Zelda Montes, a former Google employee who was arrested during a protest of Project Nimbus, said Google fired workers to suppress organising and send a message to its workforce that dissent would not be tolerated.“Google is attempting to instil fear in employees,"" Montes said in a statement provided by No Tech For Apartheid, an organising group affiliated with some of the fired workers.Late last month, some Google employees in New York and California staged sit-ins opposing the company's cloud contract with the Israel government. Some participants were arrested, and Google fired over 50 employees involved in the protests. Called Project Nimbus, the $1.2 billion contract has been jointly awarded to Google and Amazon.com to supply the Israeli government with cloud services. The workers claim the project supports Israel's development of military tools. Google has said the Nimbus contract ""is not directed at highly sensitive, classified, or military workloads relevant to weapons or intelligence services.""Last week, Google CEO Sundar Pichai in an email to employees said that the company property shouldn't be used for ""disruptive issues or debate politics.""","Google employees fired for protesting the company's contract with Israel have filed the complaint with the National Labor Relations Board ( NLRB) The workers allege that Google violated their labour rights by terminating their employment.

TCS CEO is against this notion of AI impact on jobs in India and worldwide,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/tcs-ceo-is-against-this-notion-of-ai-impact-on-jobs-in-india-and-worldwide/articleshow/109738179.cms,"TCS CEO K Krithivasan

does not per se agree with the view that generative AI would lead to an overall reduction in jobs. In a recent interaction with Financial Times, TCS CEO challenged the notion that generative AI would lead to an overall reduction in jobs, arguing that “the world is going to need more and more people, not fewer people, in terms of technology talent — and India has so many people.”

“Gen AI’s ability to create new data and content is driving innovation across sectors.

We expect wider adoption in the financial year 2025, with focus on seamless integration with current workflows with a ‘human-in-the-loop’ approach.”

Talking about the impact of

Gen AI

, Krithivasan told FT that the impact would be seen more long term than expecting to get the benefits in the next two to three quarters. Despite the potential for change, Krithivasan is against overestimating the immediate impact of generative AI.

TCS' AI deals kitty

TCS’s AI and genAI pipeline has doubled to $900 million during the March quarter. In the recent earnings call, Krithivasan said he is gradually seeing a few gen AI use cases moving to production.

He said that Gen-AI is steadfastly at the forefront of the technology trends and customers are on the lookout for POCs (proofs of concept) on the efficiencies that can be enabled in application development, application maintenance and deployment automation.

\

“A full realization of Gen AI’s benefits will take time and enterprises and society still have considerable challenges to address. These include managing the risks inherent in Gen AI, reskilling and upskilling the workforce and reimagining core business processes. Customers are looking at scaling out POCs and pilots by implementing necessary guardrails,” Krithivasan said in the recent earnings call, after the announcement of fourth quarter results for the fiscal year 2024.

falls to No. 5 in China market

US-China tensions continue

Chinese tech giant Huawei defied expectations with a massive surge in profits for the first quarter of 2024. The company's net profit skyrocketed over 560% compared to the same period last year, reaching $2.7 billion. Revenue also grew significantly, rising 36.7% year-on-year to $24.7 billion.Huawei's resurgence coincides with a decline in iPhone sales within China.According to market research firm Counterpoint, Apple witnessed a 19% slump in iPhone sales during the first quarter of 2024. The company fell to No. 5 in the past quarter. This news follows a positive trend for Huawei, with the company previously announcing that their profits doubled in 2023.This impressive comeback comes after Huawei faced significant challenges due to US sanctions imposed in 2019. The restrictions limited the company's access to American-made components, hindering its smartphone production.In response, Huawei adopted a strategic diversification plan. The company invested heavily in areas like 5G technology , artificial intelligence, and smart-driving tech, successfully reducing their reliance on smartphone sales.While details on profit breakdown by sector weren't provided, the overall results indicate the diversification strategy's effectiveness.It's important to note that Huawei is a private company, exempting them from the detailed financial disclosures required of publicly traded firms.Despite the limitations, Huawei managed to launch the Mate 60 Pro last year, a high-end smartphone featuring a powerful chip. Experts believe such advancements wouldn't be possible without foreign technology, raising questions about the true impact of US restrictions.A Huawei representative attributed the recent growth to ""opportunities in digitalization, intelligence, and decarbonization."" They acknowledged global uncertainties but expressed confidence in achieving their annual targets and maintaining sustainable growth.The positive news for Huawei comes amidst ongoing tensions between the US and China. The two major powers continue to clash over various issues, including trade and Taiwan. Notably, the US has lobbied allies to ban Huawei's 5G technology due to security concerns.","Chinese tech giant Huawei defied expectations with a massive surge in profits for the first quarter of 2024.

Explained: WhatsApp vs government -- why WhatsApp is threatening to shutdown in India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-tips/explained-whatsapp-vs-government-why-whatsapp-is-threatening-to-leave-india/articleshow/109603229.cms,"What's the WhatsApp vs Centre dispute about

Why is WhatsApp against the rule

What does the Indian government say

Has any other country implemented such a rule

What's the HC said

WhatsApp LLC on Thursday told the Delhi High Court that the popular messaging platform will end if it is made to break encryption of messages. “As a platform, we are saying, if we are told to break encryption, then WhatsApp goes,” counsel Tejas Karia, appearing for Whatsapp, told a Division Bench comprising Acting Chief Justice Manmohan and Justice Manmeet Pritam Singh Arora.The HC was hearing a petition by WhatsApp and its parent company Facebook Inc (now Meta) challenging the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules 2021, which makes it obligatory for social media intermediaries requiring the messaging app to trace chats and make provisions to identify the first originator of information on the court's orderWhatsApp and its parent company Meta (formerly Facebook) are challenging a rule in India's IT laws that requires them to identify the originator of messages on their platform.The Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 were announced by the government on February 25, 2021 and required large social media platforms like Twitter , Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp to comply with the latest norms.WhatsApp says it can't comply without breaking its end-to-end encryption, a feature that scrambles messages so only the sender and receiver can read them. This, they argue, violates user privacy. In its petition filed in 2021, WhatsApp has said the requirement of intermediaries enabling the identification of the first originator of information in India upon government or court order puts end-to-end encryption and its benefits ""at risk"".WhatsApp LLC has urged the high court to declare Rule 4(2) of the intermediary rules as unconstitutional, ultra vires the IT Act and illegal and sought that no criminal liability be imposed on it for any alleged non-compliance with Rule 4(2) which requires enabling the identification of the first originator of information. WhatsApp said that the traceability provision is unconstitutional and against the fundamental right to privacy.The government argues traceability is needed to tackle harmful content like fake news and hate speech, especially during sensitive situations. They believe social media platforms have a responsibility for online safety. In its reply, the Centre has said the law empowers it to expect such entities to create safe cyberspace and counter ""illegal content"" either themselves or by assisting the law enforcement agencies.The Centre has told the court that Section 87 of the Information Technology Act gave it power to formulate Rule 4(2) of the Intermediary Rules which mandates a significant social media intermediary to enable the identification of the first originator of an information in ""legitimate state interest"" of curbing the menace of fake news and offences concerning national security and public order as well as women and children.The Centre has also stated that if a platform does not have the means to trace the first originator without breaking the encryption then it is the platform which ""ought to develop such mechanism"" in larger public duty.WhatsApp claims no other country has a similar law, including Brazil. ""There is no such rule anywhere else in the world. Not even in Brazil,"" the lawyer appearing for WhatsApp said, adding that the requirement was against the privacy of users and the rule was introduced without any consultation. In September 2023, the UK government conceded that it will not use controversial powers in the online safety bill to scan messaging apps for harmful content until it is “technically feasible” to do so, postponing measures that critics say threaten users’ privacy.The Delhi High Court will hear the case in August 2024. This combines petitions filed against the IT Rules in various High Courts across India. After brief arguments, the HC called for a balance to be struck and posted the case for further hearing on August 14. “…Privacy rights were not absolute” and “somewhere balance has to be done”, the HC observed","WhatsApp and its parent company Meta (formerly Facebook) are challenging a rule in India's IT laws that requires them to identify the originator of messages on their platform. WhatsApp says it can't comply without breaking its end-to-end encryption, a feature that scrambles messages so only the sender and receiver can read them.

A captivating romance can uplift anyone's spirits, and anime has a unique ability to vividly portray these narratives. Over the years, Japanese animation has delivered numerous romantic tales, ranging from light-hearted comedies to deeply emotional dramas.For romance enthusiasts, going through the vast array of anime options can be overwhelming. However, there are several exceptional romance anime series that truly shine above the rest.Here is a curated list of top romance anime series , compiled by Game Rant, along with their respective rankings.Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie stirred mixed reactions upon its debut in Spring 2022, often compared to ""My Dress-Up Darling"" but standing out as a unique slice-of-life anime centred around a charming couple, Shikimori and Yuu Izumi.One distinctive aspect of the series is its portrayal of the main couple already in a relationship, a rarity in anime. While the episodes focus on everyday moments, they paint a wholesome picture of young love with two endearing characters navigating the nuances of romance.Describing Bakemonogatari as a straightforward romance might be a stretch, but this instalment of Monogatari indeed focuses on and highlights the relationship between Koyomi Araragi and Hitagi Senjougahara. Their initial interactions are unconventional, involving a stapler to the face, but Araragi's determination to assist Senjougahara with her curse ultimately brings them closer.Despite the surreal and eccentric nature of Monogatari, the romance between Araragi and Senjougahara is remarkably grounded and healthy. While the series introduces other potential romantic interests, their relationship remains steadfast and central to the narrative.""Sing 'Yesterday' for Me"" presents romance in a refreshingly realistic manner compared to many other anime. The series takes a classic love triangle and steers it in an unexpected direction by the end, resulting in a highly satisfying conclusion that portrays how failed romances can evolve into strong friendships.Directed by Yoshiyuki Fujiwara, known for his work on popular anime like ""Attack on Titan"" and ""Sword Art Online,"" the shift to a show with such a different tone demonstrates his versatility and mastery in storytelling across diverse genres.""My Happy Marriage"" emerged as one of the standout romance anime of Summer 2023, adapted from Akumi Agitogi's novel series. Set in an alternate Meiji Restoration era with supernatural elements, the story follows Miyo, who endures mistreatment from her stepfamily despite her privileged background. Her family arranges her marriage to a notorious military figure known for rejecting wives quickly, with rejection spelling disaster for Miyo. However, Kiyoka surprises everyone by taking an interest in Miyo and becoming incensed by her family's cruelty.The anime delves into the lasting impact of Miyo's abuse, highlighting her struggle to regain self-worth, even with Kiyoka's support. Kiyoka himself is a complex character with hidden motives behind his initial attraction to Miyo, although his feelings for her are genuine.While the romance between Miyo and Kiyoka is heartwarming, ""My Happy Marriage"" falls short in other areas. The supernatural elements can seem disjointed, and the villains are one-dimensional despite being detestable.Based on Fumita Yanagida's popular and finished manga, ""Tomo-chan Is a Girl!"" stood out as one of Winter 2023's most amusing romantic comedies. Tomo and Jun share a close friendship, but Jun sees Tomo strictly as a friend, unaware of her romantic feelings.While romance is central to its characters, ""Tomo-chan Is a Girl!"" leans heavily into comedy. Tomo and Jun's dynamic is charming, and they're supported by entertaining characters like Misuzu and Carol. Despite its comedic tone, the chemistry between Tomo and Jun develops convincingly over the season. Unlike some romance anime, Tomo-chan excels in portraying why its leads are compatible without difficulty.Teen romance anime often dominate the genre, but there are exceptions worth noting. ""Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku"" is primarily a workplace comedy that revolves around two couples: the newly formed pair of Hirotaka Nifuji and Narumi Momose, and the more established couple, Tarou Kabakura and Hanako Koyanagi. The focus remains on Hirotaka and Narumi, with the series emphasising humour over romance, but Tarou and Hanako's relationship is depicted realistically.Despite being childhood friends, Narumi struggles to see Hirotaka as a potential romantic interest, a dynamic that persists throughout the series. The anime's brevity limits the depth of these relationships, but ""Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku"" provides an entertaining journey within its runtime.""Romantic Killer"" cleverly parodies romance and harem anime while paying homage to their core strengths. Anzu, a girl with no interest in boys, is suddenly thrust into a reverse harem scenario by a magical being, disrupting her life of gaming and chocolate consumption. Unamused by her newfound romantic entanglements with unfamiliar guys, Anzu navigates this unconventional situation with scepticism.Primarily a comedy, ""Romantic Killer"" aims to elicit laughter from its audience, often succeeding with its humour rooted in its origins as a shonen manga, characterised by exaggerated facial expressions.Though not always aiming for emotional depth, the anime treats its characters and their relationships seriously. Anzu shines as a compelling lead, and the male characters introduced as potential partners are well-developed. ""Romantic Killer"" offers a delightful blend of humour and romance for those seeking an entertaining and unconventional love story.""The Angel Next Door Spoils Me Rotten"" captivates viewers from the start for several reasons. Firstly, Project No.9's animation is impressive, featuring clean and detailed character designs. Secondly, and most importantly, the main characters exhibit instant chemistry, evident when Amane offers his umbrella to a soaked Mahiru, sparking a connection.Throughout the series, despite the frequent presence of both leads on screen, ""The Angel Next Door Spoils Me Rotten"" effectively delves into their individual personalities while also developing their friendship.Rumiko Takahashi is celebrated as a legendary mangaka, known for classics like Inuyasha, Ranma 1/2, and Urusei Yatsura. While most of her renowned works fall within the shonen genre, Takahashi has also ventured into seinen storytelling. Maison Ikkoku stands out as one of her most mature works, emphasising romance as its primary theme.Unlike Takahashi's prominent shonen series that explore various genres such as comedy and action alongside romance, Maison Ikkoku focuses squarely on romantic elements, enriched with drama, character development, and humour.The central relationship features Kyouko and Yuusaku, both drawn to each other but hindered by their circumstances. Kyouko, grieving the recent loss of her husband, is hesitant to move forward. Meanwhile, Yuusaku, deeply in love with Kyouko, doubts his worthiness as a student. The anime chronicles their journeys of growth, healing, and mutual misunderstanding, complemented by well-developed secondary characters.Insomniacs After School emerged as the standout romance of Spring 2023, adapted from Makoto Ojiro's esteemed seinen manga. The story revolves around two students plagued by insomnia, a burden they carried alone until they met at their school's observatory. Isaki and Ganta form an immediate bond, which deepens as they work together to revive the Astronomy Club, driven by their shared need to preserve their newfound sanctuary.The anime boasts impeccable pacing, skillfully depicting the protagonists' isolation due to insomnia and the subtle solace they find in each other. While romance is a central theme, the series prioritises developing Ganta and Isaki's friendship before advancing their relationship, emphasising the depth of their connection beyond shared circumstances.Kokoro Connect injects a supernatural twist into a classic love triangle scenario. The story centers around Taichi, Iori, Yui, Yoshifumi, and Himeko, students of the Student Cultural Research Club, whose lives take a turn when they receive supernatural abilities from a mysterious being named Heartseed.As they grapple with these newfound powers, the group experiences sensory phenomena that challenge their relationships and reveal hidden aspects of their personalities. The anime is rich in character development, providing an engaging and thought-provoking experience.Maid Sama! carries many tropes that might derail other romance anime: an overly perfect male lead, a strong female protagonist reduced to a damsel, and an unnecessary love triangle. Despite these shortcomings, Maid Sama! shines through its strong personality.The heart of Maid Sama! lies in the relationship between Takumi Usui, a charming heartthrob, and Misaki Ayuzawa, a strict student council president with a busy schedule balancing school, home, and work. When Takumi discovers Misaki's secret job at a maid cafe, it opens a new perspective on the usually composed president.In ""Rascal Does Not Dream Of Bunny Girl Senpai,"" romance plays a subtle yet compelling role that defines the series. The story centers on Sakuta Azusagawa, a high school student drawn to girls suffering from Adolescence Syndrome, a condition linked to their insecurities.While the anime unfolds through different arcs focusing on various girls, the standout is the initial saga featuring Mai Sakurajima, an actress who forms a close bond with Sakuta. Their dynamic crackles with romantic tension, warmth, and clever banter. Although not always in the foreground, their relationship develops steadily across subsequent arcs, leading to a satisfying sequel in the form of a feature film.Wakana Gojou and Marin Kitagawa inhabit completely contrasting worlds. Gojou, isolated and reserved, keeps himself apart from others due to his passion for hina dolls, fearing ridicule. In contrast, Kitagawa is popular, outgoing, and self-assured.Despite their differences, Kitagawa becomes intrigued by cosplay and sees Gojou as the ideal person to create outfits for her. ""My Dress-Up Darling"" is a charming, humorous, and beautifully animated romance anime that excels in executing classic genre tropes with finesse.""Toradora!"" is a beloved slice-of-life romantic comedy that offers a wonderful entry point into the genre. The story revolves around Ryuji Yusaku and Taiga Aisaka, two students who have crushes on each other's best friends.Both Ryuji and Taiga are viewed as outcasts—Ryuji due to his intimidating appearance and Taiga because of her fiery temper. They team up to assist each other in their romantic pursuits. The series delves into their evolving dynamic and the humorous mishaps that ensue as they navigate their intertwined love lives.""The Pet Girl of Sakurasou"" depicts the journey of an eccentric group of characters as they navigate growth and self-discovery. Sorata Kanda is forced to move into the unconventional Sakura House after being kicked out of his school's main dorms.In Sakura House, Sorata encounters talented yet troubled students. When a peculiar young artist joins the dorm, Sorata takes on the responsibility of helping her adjust to her new life. The series delves into the interactions among the dorm mates, their personal aspirations, and the interconnected nature of their relationships.""Ouran High School Host Club"" is a delightful reverse harem anime filled with lighthearted and meaningful moments. Haruhi Fujioka accidentally breaks an antique vase belonging to her school's Host Club and must repay her debt by disguising herself as a boy and working as a host.The series excels in developing Haruhi's character along with her fellow hosts, providing insight into their motivations and personalities. It's a must-watch for shojo fans, featuring a memorable cast of characters that carries the show through its run.Kyoto Animation has produced many beloved anime, and ""Love, Chunibyo & Other Delusions!"" is among them. The series centers around a phenomenon known as Chunibyo, where adolescents have grandiose and unrealistic delusions.Yuta Togashi, who has outgrown his delusional phase, aims for a normal high school life. However, things take a turn when his classmate, Rikka Takanashi, reminds him of his past and tries to pull him back into the world of Chunibyo with her own delusions. The series delves into their relationship as Yuta unravels the triggers behind Rikka's delusions.The trope of opposites attracting may be overused, but when done well, it can lead to a captivating romantic comedy. ""Kimi ni Todoke"" explores the endearing friendship between the shy Sawako Kuronuma and the popular Shouta Kazehaya. Sawako, often mistaken for Sadako from ""The Ring,"" is isolated at school due to her appearance, making it challenging for her to break out of her shell. Fortunately, Kazehaya is just the right person to help her.""Kimi ni Todoke"" is a delightful and heartwarming anime with well-developed characters who evolve as the story unfolds. While it adheres to typical romance anime pacing, the journey remains engaging and enjoyable.Unlike most romance stories that focus on the process of falling in love, ""Tonikawa: Over The Moon For You"" follows a married couple who have already reached that point. As a result, the anime adopts a slice-of-life approach, showcasing Nasa and Tsukasa's daily life and antics rather than a typical romantic journey. ""Tonikawa"" doesn't rely on dramatic highs but instead offers a pleasant and light-hearted experience.While this anime may not appeal to everyone, it serves as a refreshing departure from more melodramatic romance shows. Despite their tendency to blush at the slightest physical contact, Nasa and Tsukasa are refreshingly direct in expressing their feelings, making them both witty and likeable characters.This romantic anime shines because of its main character, Takeo Gouda. His towering, imposing presence contrasts beautifully with his heartfelt affection for the delicate Rinko, which is truly heartwarming. Takeo's efforts to play matchmaker for Rinko with his best friend, despite his own feelings, demonstrate his genuine kindness.Viewers will undoubtedly root for Takeo and Rinko's endearing relationship. ""My Love Story!!"" delivers the goods without delay, as the main characters are dating for most of the episodes, bypassing the typical slow build-up to a confession.""A Sign of Affection"" is a heartwarming romantic comedy centred on college-age love and the challenges of communication. While not the sole focus of the story, Yuki and Itsuomi stand out as the main couple, instantly captivating viewers. Yuki, who is hearing-impaired, communicates using sign language, text, and by reading lips, while Itsuomi is a world traveller passionate about learning languages. Their connection begins on a train and grows stronger with each subsequent encounter.The anime beautifully captures the intense emotions of falling in love, highlighted by a poignant moment in the opening episode. With an older cast, ""A Sign of Affection"" takes on a more mature tone compared to typical romance anime. Throughout the season, Yuki and Itsuomi become increasingly comfortable around each other, resulting in consistently endearing interactions.This romantic anime is ideal for LGBTQ+ viewers seeking representation on screen, but its well-crafted storytelling makes it enjoyable for all audiences. The heartwarming romance blossoms between Mafuyu and Ritsuka as Mafuyu learns to play guitar and sing in Ritsuka's band.Watching Mafuyu's growing confidence alongside the romantic tension creates a compelling series that's hard to resist. The accompanying movie is also outstanding and a must-watch continuation of the series.Nana is one of the most renowned and beloved shoujo anime of all time, a must-watch for fans of romance and beyond. The series follows two women named Nana, seemingly different but navigating curiously similar life situations that lead to separate outcomes.Without giving away how their stories intertwine, Nana's 47 episodes delve into the protagonists' perspectives on love through various relationships. Grounded in reality, the anime explores complex characters who, despite occasional extremes, face accountability for their actions.Your Lie in April, one of the most famous romance anime, revolves around two music prodigies: Kousei Arima and Kaori Miyazono. Kousei, grappling with depression after his mother's death, loses his passion for the piano and withdraws from the performance arts. One day, he hears Kaori playing her violin with such freedom that it reignites his love for music and sparks his admiration for her.The anime delves into themes of grief, life, love, and music. Kousei's journey toward self-healing is profound, marked by heartbreak, but also punctuated by moments of beauty, tenderness, and joy.In this anime, Miyuki and Kaguya engage in a battle of wits to avoid confessing their love first, using their intellect and skills to outmaneuver each other. Both are determined not to be seen as the one who gives in.Their antics running the student council at an elite school with their friends are uproariously funny yet also contain heartwarming moments that will make viewers cheer. Season 3 of Kaguya-sama: Love is War, which aired in Spring 2022, leaned heavily into comedy but also devoted more time to developing Miyuki and Kaguya's relationship and touching on other romances.If the anime follows the manga, the next season of Love is War promises to be predominantly romantic. If successful, this upcoming release could elevate Kaguya-sama to the pinnacle of romance anime.This anime consists of two parts: Clannad and After Story. The latter surpasses the former by a wide margin, but watching Clannad is essential to fully appreciate the impact of After Story. While it features a diverse cast of supporting characters, the heart of the show revolves around Tomoya Okazaki and Nagisa Furukawa, delivering a profound narrative.Unlike typical romance series, Clannad After Story unfolds beyond high school, depicting the growth of Tomoya and Nagisa as individuals and as a couple. The anime tackles real-life challenges without glossing over them, offering a genuine exploration of common struggles.The Dangers in My Heart is truly brilliant. At first glance, it may seem like another typical shounen romance where a popular girl falls for an ordinary loner guy. These stories often offer little beyond wish fulfilment, and The Dangers in My Heart initially appears to fit that mould. Yet, the anime stands out.Ichikawa is an average guy with few friends who daydreams about unusual things. While the anime doesn't delve deeply into these thoughts, it doesn't ignore them either, leaving Ichikawa with a poor first impression. On the other hand, Anna is a cheerful but shy girl who loves food and works as a model. After a chance encounter at the school library, the two start spending time together, developing a friendship that hints at something deeper. Anna encourages Ichikawa to break out of his shell, leading to significant changes in him over the course of two seasons.Although slow-paced initially, The Dangers in My Heart evolves into something special by the end of season 1, maintaining its momentum in the subsequent cour and establishing itself as one of the best romance anime of all time. Anna and Ichikawa are both exceptional characters, but Anna's depth is what elevates the show. She's not just an idealised plot device; she's a fully realised character with insecurities, quirks, and vulnerabilities. Her interest in Ichikawa feels genuine, and vice versa. This is a rare quality in romance anime.Fruits Basket is the definitive romance anime, masterfully blending drama and comedy. Tooru Honda, a lovable protagonist, faces life's challenges until she moves in with the Souma family. The Soumas, particularly Yuki, are school idols hiding a shocking secret that alters perceptions.Love triangles often lack depth, favouring one partner over the other. Fruits Basket defies this norm with its compelling love triangle, where each character is fully developed. Across three seasons, Fruits Basket takes viewers on an unforgettable journey.Also read | 15 best anime series of all time; here's the list","Japanese animation has delivered numerous romantic tales, ranging from light- hearted comedies to deeply emotional dramas.

WhatsApp shutdown threat in India: 4 Reasons government says Whatsapp needs to 'follow' IT rules,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/whatsapp-shutdown-threat-in-india-4-reasons-government-says-whatsapp-needs-to-follow-it-rules/articleshow/109669319.cms,"WhatsApp not legally entitled to claim that it protects users' privacy

Tough for law enforcement agencies to trace fake messages as well as terrorists

Social media platforms like Whatsapp and Facebook need to be accountable to users as well as law of the country they operate in

IT Rules in India are in line with global accepted norms

(With agency inputs)

Messaging service platform WhatsApp this week submitted before the Delhi High Court that if it is made or compelled to break encryption of messages, then the platform will stop functioning. The submissions came while the division bench led by the Acting Chief Justice was hearing the petitions moved by WhatsApp and Facebook challenging newly amended IT Rules .Facebook and Whatsapp recently challenged the new rules on grounds that they violate the right to privacy and are unconstitutional.""As a platform, we are saying, if we are told to break encryption, then WhatsApp goes,"" the lawyer who appeared for WhatsApp submitted. The company claims that the requirement was against the privacy of users and the rule was introduced without any consultation, WhatsApp said while opposing the amendment in IT Rules.On February 25, the Centre framed the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules 2021, in the exercise of powers under section 87 (2) of the Information Technology Act, 2000 and in supersession of the earlier Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines) Rules 2011.The new guidelines issued by the government of India mandated a grievance redressal system for over the top (OTT) and digital portals in the country.The Centre told the Delhi High Court that WhatsApp and Facebook which monetizes users' information for business or commercial purposes are not legally entitled to claim that it protects privacy.The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY's) through an affidavit opposed the petition of Whatsapp and Facebook challenging newly amended IT Rules, states that WhatsApp has already violated the fundamental rights of the users in India by denying them any dispute resolution rights in the country. The clauses of Dispute Resolution and the Governing Law are reproduced below to testify the same.Ministry has also told the Delhi High Court that if the IT Rules 2021 are not implemented, the law enforcement agencies will have difficulty in tracing the origin of fake messages and such messages will percolate in other platforms thereby disturbing peace and harmony in the society further leading to public order issues.The affidavit further stated that MeitY's approach to the framing of legislation and rules is founded on the principles that the Internet should be open, safe trusted, Platforms should be accountable to users and no one should be allowed to take away the fundamental rights of Indian citizens guaranteed by the Constitution of India.It added that the said statutory provision and the Rules are merely a manifestation of settled global jurisprudence developing around the secondary liability or responsibility of intermediaries in the changing dynamic of human interactions that World-wide-web and the platforms in the nature of ""significant social media intermediaries"" enable.It is submitted that the principle of secondary liability or responsibility on part of significant social media intermediaries provides that despite the intermediary not being the creator of the problematic or illegal content, such significant social media intermediaries would have to abide by certain stipulations in case such problematic content breaches the stipulations of the law as it enables projecting or publicising or advertising the content.","Messaging service platform WhatsApp this week submitted before the Delhi High Court that if it is made or compelled to break encryption of messages, then the platform will stop functioning.
