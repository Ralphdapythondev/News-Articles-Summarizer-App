What Anthropic said

Amazon-backed artificial intelligence company Anthropic has been sued by three authors who claim that the company has misused their books and others to train its AI-powered chatbot Claude. The authors, as reported by Reuters, have filed a class-action lawsuit against Anthropic in California.The lawsuit requests an unspecified amount of monetary damages and an order permanently blocking Anthropic from misusing the authors' work.Writers and journalists Andrea Bartz, Charles Graeber and Kirk Wallace Johnson filed the lawsuit on Tuesday. The authors said in their complaint that Anthropic has ""built a multibillion-dollar business by stealing hundreds of thousands of copyrighted books.""They said that Anthropic used pirated versions of their works and others to teach Claude to respond to human prompts. They claim that ClaudeAI was trained on dataset called “The Pile” that includes a significant portion called Books3 - a collection of pirated ebooks from popular authors such as Stephen King and Michael Poll.“Just like the developers of other technologies that have come before, from the printing press to the copy machine to the web-crawler, AI companies must follow the law,” the authors demanded,” the authors demanded.The report quotes an Anthropic spokesperson who said that the company was aware of the lawsuit and assessing the complaint. However, the spokesperson declined to comment further, citing pending litigation.This is not the first case where a lawsuit has been filed against a tech company over alleged misuse of copyright data to train AI models . Separate groups of authors have sued OpenAI and Meta Platforms over the companies' alleged misuse of their work to train the large-language models underlying their chatbots.","Writers and journalists Andrea Bartz, Charles Graeber and Kirk Wallace Johnson filed the lawsuit on Tuesday.

""Job cuts not about profitability""

Cisco's second round of layoffs this year has sent shockwaves through the company. While the company has confirmed the job cuts in an SEC filing last week, employees reportedly continue to face weeks of uncertainty about their fate. According to multiple Cisco employees who spoke with TechCrunch, the PC giant has delayed informing affected employees until September 16.In the SEC filing last week, Cisco said that it is cutting 7% of its workforce. The cuts will reduce Cisco’s headcount of 90,400 by about 7% — indicating a loss of more than 6,300 jobs. The move will reportedly bring short-term costs of about $1 billion, Cisco said. It also has been digesting the purchase of Splunk Inc, which it acquired earlier this year.“This has become the most toxic environment I’ve ever worked in,” one anonymous Cisco employee told TechCrunch. ""Two layoffs of this magnitude in the same calendar year is beyond the pale.""The news follows an earlier round of layoffs in February that impacted around 4,000 employees. In February this year, Cisco Systems said that it would cut 5% of its global workforce and lowered its annual revenue target as the company navigates a tough economy.In an interview to Bloomberg, Scott Herren, Cisco's Chief Financial Officer, said that job cuts are not about trying to boost profits. He added that Cisco needs to rapidly shift further into cybersecurity, cloud systems and artificial intelligence-related products, so it’s freeing up resources to do that.In a statement, Cisco’s chair and CEO Chuck Robbins, said the company plans to further integrate Splunk into its products. It will also combine its networking, security and collaboration departments into one organization led by Jeetu Patel, Robbins said. Jonathan Davidson, Cisco Networking’s general manager and executive vice president, will become an adviser to Robbins.","Cisco has confirmed that it is cutting 7% of its workforce.

Beyond the Olympics

What all stood out in July

Streaming services continue to dominate TV viewership in the US, reaching a record 41.4% share in July, according to Nielsen's latest Gauge report. The Nielsen Gauge report unveils TV viewing trends of the US audience across platforms and distributors. According to a report in Reuters, quoting the Nielsen's report, this growth is largely attributed to the highly anticipated Paris Olympics and the ongoing US presidential election campaign.The record-breaking viewership numbers on streaming platforms paint a clear picture: audiences are increasingly abandoning cable. This trend is reflected in the declining cable share, which dropped to 26.7% in July.Traditional media giants like Netflix , Amazon , and Disney are recognizing the shifting consumer preference and investing heavily in sports content. Securing broadcasting rights for major events like the Olympics has become a key strategy to attract younger viewers.While the Olympics sparked the surge, cable news also saw a significant boost (52%) due to the Republican National Convention and the shocking news of an assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump .* Comcast's Peacock led the pack with a 33% jump in monthly usage, fueled by Olympics coverage and popular shows like ""Love Island USA.""* Google-owned YouTube became the first platform to surpass 10% of total TV usage (10% in July vs. 9.9% in June).* ""House of the Dragon"" on HBO Max emerged as the most-watched program with 4.7 billion viewing minutes, followed by ""Bluey"" on Disney+ (4.3 billion) and ""The Boys"" on Amazon Prime (4.2 billion).The Future of TV:* Other streamers that performed well include Amazon.com's Amazon Prime Video and Roku Channel.","Streaming services continue to dominate TV viewership in the US, reaching a record 41.4% share in July.

Tesla, the innovative company led by Elon Musk , is pushing the boundaries of robotics by developing its humanoid robot, Optimus. In an effort to make these robots move more like humans, Tesla is employing people to wear motion capture suits and virtual reality (VR) headsets. This initiative aims to gather essential data to refine the movement capabilities of Optimus, ensuring that it can navigate and perform tasks in a way that closely mimics human behaviour.To achieve the goal of human-like movement for its robots, Tesla has recruited over 50 individuals as “Data Collection Operators,” according to a report by Business Insider. These operators play a crucial role in the development of Optimus by providing the necessary data that engineers and developers use to enhance the robot’s performance.The position of a Data Collection Operator is quite specific in terms of requirements:The data gathered from these activities is critical for programming the robot’s movements, allowing Optimus to perform tasks with increased precision and fluidity. The job offers competitive pay, ranging from $25 to $48 per hour, along with bonuses, stocks, and additional benefits, making it an attractive position for those interested in the cutting-edge field of robotics.Tesla’s journey into humanoid robotics began with a bold announcement by Elon Musk during the company’s AI Day event in 2021. Musk introduced the concept of a humanoid robot that would leverage Tesla’s advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and autonomous systems, with the potential to revolutionise industries ranging from manufacturing to personal assistance.In 2022, Tesla unveiled its first humanoid robot prototype, named Bumblebee. This prototype marked a significant milestone in Tesla’s robotics program. During its first public demonstration, Bumblebee was able to walk onto the stage and wave to the audience, showcasing its bipedal mobility. A demonstration video further highlighted its capabilities, showing Bumblebee picking up and moving boxes in an office environment. This demonstration served as proof of concept, indicating that Tesla was on the right track in developing a functional humanoid robot.Building on the success of Bumblebee, Tesla continued to develop and refine its humanoid robot, Optimus. Earlier this year, Elon Musk revealed that two Optimus robots were already working autonomously at one of Tesla’s factories. This milestone demonstrated the robot’s potential to contribute to industrial operations, showcasing its ability to perform repetitive and physically demanding tasks without human intervention.Elon Musk’s vision for Optimus extends beyond Tesla’s internal operations. In July, he announced on X (formerly Twitter) that Tesla plans to have “genuinely useful humanoid robots in low production for Tesla internal use next year.” He further expressed optimism about ramping up production for external companies by 2026. This timeline indicates Tesla’s commitment to not only perfecting the robot’s capabilities but also making it commercially viable.If successful, Optimus could have a transformative impact on various industries. Its potential applications are vast, ranging from automating labor-intensive tasks in factories to providing personal assistance in homes. The integration of AI and robotics could lead to significant efficiency gains, cost savings, and improved safety in environments that are hazardous or difficult for humans to operate in.The use of motion capture and VR technology is pivotal in training Optimus to move like a human. Motion capture suits allow Tesla to record the precise movements of the Data Collection Operators, capturing details such as joint angles, stride lengths, and balance shifts. This data is then fed into algorithms that guide the robot’s movements, enabling it to replicate human-like motion with greater accuracy.The VR headsets worn by operators create an immersive environment that simulates various scenarios in which Optimus might operate. By exposing the robot to these simulations, Tesla can fine-tune its responses to different tasks and environments, ensuring that Optimus can perform a wide range of activities with minimal errors. This combination of motion capture and VR technology represents a cutting-edge approach to robot training, setting the stage for more advanced and capable robots in the future.Tesla’s efforts to develop a humanoid robot like Optimus have far-reaching implications. Beyond its immediate applications in manufacturing and personal assistance, the success of Optimus could pave the way for broader adoption of humanoid robots across multiple sectors. Industries such as healthcare, logistics, and construction could benefit from robots capable of performing complex tasks with human-like dexterity and precision.Moreover, the data collection and motion analysis methods being employed by Tesla could lead to advancements in AI and robotics that extend beyond the realm of humanoid robots. The knowledge gained from this project could contribute to the development of other robotic systems, autonomous vehicles, and AI-driven technologies.","Tesla is hiring data collection operators for its humanoid robot, Optimus.

What Reliance Jio, Airtel and Vodafone said in their submission to TRAI

Another big fight is brewing between telecom operators -- Airtel, Reliance Jio and Vodafone-Idea -- and internet giants over the regulation of over-the-top (OTT) platforms. Telecom industry body COAI has called for bringing popular messaging and video call apps like WhatsApp , Telegram , and Google Meet under the ambit of telecom licences, arguing that they contribute significantly to data traffic and infrastructure costs.COAI members include Airtel, Reliance Jio, Vodafone-Idea and BSNL. However, the Broadband India Forum (BIF) has vehemently opposed this move, claiming it's discriminatory and unconstitutional. BIF members include Google, Microsoft, WhatsApp, Facebook and others.Industry body BIF has claimed that telecom service providers' -- Airtel, Reliance Jio and Vodafone-Idea -- suggestion to bring internet call and messaging apps like WhatsApp, Telegram, and Google Meet under the ambit of telecom licences is in violation of the Constitution of India. In a statement, BIF president TV Ramachandran said that bringing OTT (over-the-top) services under the Telecom Act is in complete violation of Article 14 of the Constitution, which guarantees equal treatment to every person and entity.""Comparing OTT services to telecom services of voice and SMS is completely erroneous and overlooks the vast and critical differences between the two categories,"" Ramachandran said. He asserted that OTT services are fundamentally different from traditional telecom services, as they don't own network infrastructure or enjoy the same spectrum rights.He said telecom service providers enjoy several exclusive and unique rights that include the right to interference-free spectrum, numbering resources, right of way to set up infrastructure etc. However, OTT players neither have these privileges nor do they own the network or control the access to telecom infrastructure.In response to the “Introduction of a Unified-Service Pan India Authorization” BIF said that different types of services require different terms and conditions and a single authorisation ignoring thedifferent types of telecommunication services and ignoring different terms and conditions attached to each type of telecommunication services will be completely arbitrary and will greatly damage the regulatory framework. It will be in violation of the framework given in Section 3(1) and Section 3(2) of the Telecommunications Act, 2023 and level playing field, which will be changed in favour of few and against others.Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea and industry body COAI -- in their comments on the consultation paper issued by Trai, seeking views on the framework for service authorisations to be granted under the Telecommunications Act, 2023 -- have said that the calling and messaging apps should be brought under services to be provided through authorisation.""As per our understanding, OTT Communication services are covered under the new Telecom Act as an access service,"" Telecom operators industry body COAI said in its submission to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai).","Telecom industry body COAI has called for bringing popular messaging and video call apps like WhatsApp under the ambit of telecom licences.

Tensor G4, Gemini and more AI inside

Upgraded cameras with the new 'Add me' AI feature for photos

Google has launched its second-generation Pixel foldable phone, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold , which is its first-ever foldable phone in India. The second-gen Pixel Fold upgrades on some salient aspects over the first one. Per Google, the foldable is slim, super durable, and has a brighter screen, both on the outside and inside. And, the phone also packs in Pixel’s “fastest, most powerful” Tensor G4 chip , bringing on-device multimodal capabilities to the phone.On the inside, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold comes equipped with an 8 inches ‘Super Actua Flex display,’ an LTPO panel with a 2922x1344 resolution at 486 PPI. The inner screen has a dynamic refresh rate of 1-120Hz and can go as bright as 3,000 nits, which Google says is 80% brighter than the screen on the first-gen Pixel Fold. To make use of phone’s large inner canvas, there’s a split-screen mode that’ll let you use two apps side-by-side.When unfolded, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold can be used a regular phone with a 6.3 inches outer screen, which has the same specs as the inner screen.Google says that the Pixel 9 Pro Fold has an “all-new” hinge that is made from stainless steel and has an aerospace grade aluminium alloy cover. The hinge has a polished finish, while the back has the silky matt finish. The phone is rated IPX8 for water resistivity. And there’s Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the outside.Powering the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is Google’s Tensor G4 chip, also found on the other three Pixel 9 phones. The chip comes paired with 16GB of RAM and up to 1TB storage. Then, there’s theTitan M2 security coprocessor , which enables multi-layer hardware security.There’s a 5,060mAh battery, which Google promises will last for over 24 hours and up to 100 hours with Extreme Battery Saver. The phone supports fast charging at 45W, which should fill up the battery up to 55% in about 30 minutes. FYI, the charger isn’t included in the box. The phone also supports Qi wireless charging and Battery Share, i.e., reverse wireless charging.Out-of-the-box the Pixel 9 Pro Fold will come with Android 14 . There’s the usual Google promise of 7 years of OS and security updates.Would it even be a Pixel phone, if there’s no AI in it. Well, there’s a whole lot of AI. For starters Gemini is there, and it works in split-screen mode, as well. One could ask Gemini to write stuff or even get info about whats’s on the screen or photos. Circle To Search is also there, ohh and this feature can help you check if an image has been created using AI.The new “Pixel-exclusive” AI feature to arrive is Pixel Screenshots.

GM recently faced a few software incidents

General Motors is laying off more than 1,000 salaried employees globally in its software and services division, the company confirmed on Monday. The job cuts , which include about 600 positions at GM's tech campus near Detroit, come as part of a review to streamline operations in the unit.""As we build GM's future, we must simplify for speed and excellence, make bold choices, and prioritise the investments that will have the greatest impact,"" GM said in a statement to CNBC.The layoffs represent approximately 1.3% of GM's global salaried workforce of 76,000 as of the end of last year. The cuts primarily affect the automaker's US operations. Impacted employees were notified Monday morning.""We are grateful to those who helped establish a strong foundation that positions GM to lead moving forward,"" the automaker added in its statement.""As a result, we're reducing certain teams within the Software and Services organisation,"" GM stated. The division, currently led by executives Baris Cetinok and Dave Richardson, covers areas such as vehicle infotainment, OnStar services, and GM's Super Cruise advanced driver-assist system.The change comes less than six months after leadership shifts in the unit, including the departure of former Apple executive Mike Abbott in March due to health reasons.The job cuts follow GM's efforts to reduce costs amid industry concerns of a potential downturn and significant investments in electric vehicles and software-defined vehicles. GM has recently faced challenges with software issues in its new Chevy Blazer EV, including blank infotainment screens and charging error messages. The company issued a stop sale notice last December due to these problems, which was lifted in March.The layoffs also come after GM cancelled its ""Ultra Cruise"" programme, a competitor to Tesla's Full Self-Driving system, in January. The company merged the FSD team with its regular Super Cruise team.Despite the layoffs and recent setbacks, the company says it continues to work on expanding its hands-free driving system, with plans to broaden its capabilities by the end of 2025.","GM is laying off more than 1,000 salaried employees globally in its software and services division.

Kerala woman loses Rs 12 lakh to custom fraud: Government shares biggest tip to spot such online custom frauds,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/kerala-woman-loses-rs-12-lakh-to-custom-fraud-government-shares-biggest-tip-to-spot-such-online-custom-frauds/articleshow/112644000.cms,"How the scammers operate

What can you do in case of custom fraud

Scammers keep finding new ways to trap people and steal money from their bank accounts. One of the most prevalent scams circulating today is the 'Customs Fraud'. This deceptive scheme involves fraudsters posing as customs officials, demanding payments for fictitious packages or parcels held in customs.A woman from Kerala recently fell prey to a custom fraud incurring a loss of Rs 12 lakh.The ordeal began when the woman received a call demanding Rs 15,000 as customs duty for a gift she was allegedly expecting. Believing the caller to be a genuine customs official, she paid the amount. However, the demands escalated as the fraudsters claimed to have discovered higher-value items in the parcel, including dollars worth Rs 10 lakh. The victim continued to pay as instructed, only to realise the scam when a friend alerted her.The government’s fact-checking division, ‘ PIB Fact Check ,’ recently issued a warning to internet users about Customs-related fraud through a post on X. The post features a video demonstrating how scammers deceive people, accompanied by a voice clip detailing the criminals’ tactics in these scams. It also provides essential guidelines to help individuals protect themselves from falling victim to such schemes.For those unaware, PIB Fact Check, as the name implies, checks for fake news and misinformation related to the Government of India.In the voice clip shared, scammers impersonate an officer from the Indian Customs department when they call their target. The call begins with a pre-recorded message, claiming there’s an issue with a parcel the target was sending online, or that the package contains something illegal.The message then prompts the user to press “9” for more details or support. Once “9” is pressed, the call connects to a representative who also pretends to be from the Customs department.Typically, the scammers attempt to intimidate or blackmail the target by alleging illegal contents in the package or demanding payment under the guise of taxes. This is where the scam unfolds.First and foremost, confirm whether you or anyone in your family has actually sent a courier. If not, it's best to ignore the call. To be extra cautious, you can verify any communication from Indian Customs using the Document Identification Number (DIN) on CBIC's website.Additionally, avoid clicking on any links sent to your phone, no matter how genuine they appear. Refrain from sharing any personal information over the call, as scammers can use that information to trap you further.Finally, be sure to report the incident to your local police or the Cyber Crime department.","A woman from Kerala recently fell prey to a custom fraud incurring a loss of Rs 12 lakh.

In a surprising verdict, a Pune district court has dismissed a 13-year-old lawsuit filed by the American fast-food chain Burger King Corporation against a locally-owned eatery with the same name. The US company had accused the Pune-based Burger King of trademark infringement and sought a permanent injunction, damages, and a halt to the use of the name. The court dismissed the lawsuit filed by the Burger King Corporation in 2011, seeking a permanent injunction restraining infringement of trademark.However, the court ruled in favor of the local eatery, stating that it had been operating under the name ""Burger King"" since 1991-92, well before the US chain entered the Indian market.The plaintiff's first Indian BURGER KING restaurant was opened in New Delhi on November 9, 2014, the court said.The court found no evidence to support Burger King Corporation's claim that customers were confused or misled by the local eatery's use of the name. Additionally, the company failed to prove any actual financial loss due to the alleged infringement. The court said the Burger King Corporation has ""miserably failed"" to prove that the eatery here had infringed its trademark Burger King while running the restaurant in Pune.Burger King filed the lawsuit against Anahita Irani and Shapoor Irani. The Iranis opposed the suit, saying it was filed with malafide intentions and to discourage business people who are bonafide users and retailers. They said that apart from the name Burger King, there was absolutely no similarity in the plaintiff's trademark and their own shop name.This decision may have implications for trademark disputes involving established local businesses and multinational corporations.The Pune-based restaurant owners had counterclaimed for damages due to the harassment they endured during the lengthy legal battle. They sought Rs 20 lakh as damages. The court, however, refused any monetary relief to them too, noting that apart from oral evidence, no other proof was submitted to substantiate their claims.","Pune court dismisses 13-year-old lawsuit filed by Burger King Corporation.
