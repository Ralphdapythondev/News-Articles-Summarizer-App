Elon Musk- Donald Trump interview delayed by technical glitches; netizens call it “interview of the century”,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/elon-musk-donald-trump-interview-delayed-by-technical-glitches-netizens-call-it-interview-of-the-century/articleshow/112530129.cms,"Conversation between Trump and Musk



Public reaction over technical glitch



Also read: |

Scheduled for August 12, the interview—often labelled as the ""interview of the century""—was delayed by over 40 minutes due to technical problems. Musk addressed the issue on the platform, stating, “There appears to be a massive DDOS attack on X. Working on shutting it down. Worst case, we will proceed with a smaller number of live listeners and post the conversation later.”As users struggled to log in, hashtags like ""#crashed"" and ""DDOS"" trended on X.The situation quickly became the subject of memes. One user humorously remarked, “The best part about Twitter Spaces is how well it works,” while another joked, “I’m in the Spaces. It hasn’t started yet. It seems the whole world is trying to get into this space lol, so technical difficulties are expected.”Despite the glitches, the interview eventually went live. This marked Trump’s return to X after nearly a year of inactivity. His previous post was his mugshot from an Atlanta jail in August of the previous year. As of Monday night, Trump had gained approximately 900,000 new followers since resuming his activity on the platform.During the conversation, Musk posed softball questions that allowed Trump to stick to his campaign talking points, including on immigration and the economy. Trump reiterated parts of his stump speech and was not challenged on any of his false claims.Both men praised each other during the interview. Musk claimed, “I think we’re at a fork in the road of destiny of civilization and I think we need to take the right path and, and I think you’re the right path.” Trump responded appreciatively, stating Musk’s endorsement “meant a lot to me” and adding, “Not all endorsements mean that much, to be honest. Your endorsement meant a lot.”Musk suggested that Trump should form a new presidential commission on “government efficiency” and appoint him to it. Trump enthusiastically agreed, saying, “I’d love it.”The conversation covered a range of topics including energy policy, climate change, nuclear threats, immigration, and federal spending. Trump made accusations against Democrats, claiming they were attempting a coup to remove President Joe Biden from the ballot. He also criticised Harris’ appearance on a Time magazine cover and made controversial remarks about Jewish voters.Throughout the interview, some viewers noted that Trump’s speech at times sounded as if he had a lisp or was slurring his words. Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung dismissed these concerns, stating, “Must be your hearing.”In response to the technical issues, Kamala Harris’ campaign criticised both Trump and Musk. Harris campaign spokesman Joseph Costello described them as “self-obsessed rich guys” who would “sell out the middle class” and criticised their handling of the livestream, noting, “Trump’s entire campaign is in service of people like Elon Musk and himself—self-obsessed rich guys who cannot run a livestream in the year 2024.”","The interview was delayed by over 40 minutes due to technical problems.

From mud house to Olympic podium

Pakistan 's Olympic Gold medalist in javelin throw Arshad Nadeem has found himself embroiled in controversy after a video has surfaced showing him with a ‘designated terrorist’.

The MML is believed to be connected to Hafiz Saeed , the mastermind of the Mumbai attacks on November 9, 2008.While the exact timing of the meeting between Nadeem and Dhar remains unclear, it has sparked outrage on social media. Despite a hero's welcome upon his return to Pakistan on August 11 following his historic win at the Paris Olympics.In the video, Dhar is seen praising Nadeem for his achievement and how he has made Pakistan and all Pakistanis proud. Darr goes in to say that he has become a role model for youngsters who are now looking up to him.The Markazi Muslim League, another political wing of the Lashkar-e-Taiba, too has publicly praised Nadeem and even offered to fund a pilgrimage to Mecca for him and his parents.On August 8, Nadeem became the first Pakistani to win a Gold medal in the Olympics. He touched 92.97 metres in his second attempt to win the Gold in the men’s javelin throw competition. In the final, Nadeem crossed the 90-metre mark twice to become the first athlete in Olympic history to achieve this record. India’s Neeraj Chopra bagged the Silver medal in the event.Another post that reportedly shows Nadeem's house has gone viral. “This is the house of Olympic Champion Arshad Nadeem in Mian Channu in Pakistan — from Mian Channu to Paris — only he knows about his struggle! Arshad Nadeem deserves much more!”, reads the post. The photo has been shared by Pakistani journalist Shiraz Hassan.

Tensor G4, Gemini and more AI inside

Upgraded cameras with the new 'Add me' AI feature for photos

Google has launched its second-generation Pixel foldable phone, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold , which is its first-ever foldable phone in India. The second-gen Pixel Fold upgrades on some salient aspects over the first one. Per Google, the foldable is slim, super durable, and has a brighter screen, both on the outside and inside. And, the phone also packs in Pixel’s “fastest, most powerful” Tensor G4 chip , bringing on-device multimodal capabilities to the phone.On the inside, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold comes equipped with an 8 inches ‘Super Actua Flex display,’ an LTPO panel with a 2922x1344 resolution at 486 PPI. The inner screen has a dynamic refresh rate of 1-120Hz and can go as bright as 3,000 nits, which Google says is 80% brighter than the screen on the first-gen Pixel Fold. To make use of phone’s large inner canvas, there’s a split-screen mode that’ll let you use two apps side-by-side.When unfolded, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold can be used a regular phone with a 6.3 inches outer screen, which has the same specs as the inner screen.Google says that the Pixel 9 Pro Fold has an “all-new” hinge that is made from stainless steel and has an aerospace grade aluminium alloy cover. The hinge has a polished finish, while the back has the silky matt finish. The phone is rated IPX8 for water resistivity. And there’s Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the outside.Powering the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is Google’s Tensor G4 chip, also found on the other three Pixel 9 phones. The chip comes paired with 16GB of RAM and up to 1TB storage. Then, there’s theTitan M2 security coprocessor , which enables multi-layer hardware security.There’s a 5,060mAh battery, which Google promises will last for over 24 hours and up to 100 hours with Extreme Battery Saver. The phone supports fast charging at 45W, which should fill up the battery up to 55% in about 30 minutes. FYI, the charger isn’t included in the box. The phone also supports Qi wireless charging and Battery Share, i.e., reverse wireless charging.Out-of-the-box the Pixel 9 Pro Fold will come with Android 14 . There’s the usual Google promise of 7 years of OS and security updates.Would it even be a Pixel phone, if there’s no AI in it. Well, there’s a whole lot of AI. For starters Gemini is there, and it works in split-screen mode, as well. One could ask Gemini to write stuff or even get info about whats’s on the screen or photos. Circle To Search is also there, ohh and this feature can help you check if an image has been created using AI.The new “Pixel-exclusive” AI feature to arrive is Pixel Screenshots. The feature could organise or recall things, like events and location, all you need to is ask the phone.Google is giving one year of the Google One AI Premium plan for free to those who’ll buy the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. So, that’ll give you access to Gemini Advanced, Gemini in Gmail and Docs, on top of 2TB of cloud storage.The Pixel 9 Pro Fold ditches the camera visor for a squircle module that houses a triple lens setup – a 50MP wide camera, a 48MP ultraide and a 48MP 5x telephoto camera. For selfies, there's a 42 MP front-facing camera on the inner screen and 10MP camera on the outside.The camera hardware has been only a part of Pixel’s camera, but it’s AI that completes it. There’s a long list of AI features that complements the camera hardware on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. The usual Super Res Zoom, Zoom Enhance, Video Boost, Face Unblur, Photo Unblur, Best Take, Magic Eraser, Audio Eraser, and Magic Editor makes their return. Well, Magic Eraser now has an a “reimagine” feature that Google says can give photos a “whole new look.”One new AI tool to come to Google’s Pixel 9 pro Fold is the “Add Me,” which as you’d image can add you to a picture. So, how does it work? Well, you take photo with the group, swap in yourself, and AI will merge the photos.Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold is priced in India at Rs 1,72,999 and will be available for purchase later this year. While it comes in two colours – Obsidian and Porcelain – it’ll be available only in Obsidian colour in India.","Google has launched its second-generation Pixel foldable phone, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold.

Delta Airlines seeks compensation for disruption

In mounting problems for CrowdStrike over Microsoft outage last month, the cybersecurity company being sued by air travellers in a latest move. According to a Reuters report, air travellers whose flights were delayed or cancelled on July 19 due to Microsoft Windows outage on July 19 have filed a class action against the company.The plaintiffs include three fliers who filed the lawsuit in the federal court, Austin, Texas.They blame CrowdStrike's negligence in testing and deploying its software for the outage. Adding further, they stated that as fliers scrambled to get to their destinations, many spent hundreds of dollars on lodging, meals and alternative travel, while others missed work or suffered health problems from having to sleep on the airport floor.The filers demand CrowdStrike to pay compensatory and punitive damages to anyone whose flight was disrupted.In a statement, CrowdStrike said ""We believe this case lacks merit and we will vigorously defend the company."" The US cybersecurity company also provided an identical statement in response to a shareholder lawsuit filed on July 31.Delta claims that it faced over 2,200 flight cancellations on July 19 alone, with more than 6,000 flights cancelled since then. The airline is now dealing with over 176,000 refund or reimbursement requests. The estimated cost of the outages could reach as high as $500 million.The company’s CEO Ed Bastian said last week the outage had cost the airline $500 million, adding that it plans to take legal action to get compensation from the cybersecurity firm.Microsoft outage on July 19 was caused by a faulty software update that impacted 8 million Windows computers worldwide.

"Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange, gets Rs 722 crore GST from DGGI",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/dgci-sends-rs-722-crore-gst-notice-to-the-worlds-largest-crypto-exchange-binance/articleshow/112304561.cms,"In a groundbreaking move, the Ahmedabad zonal unit of the Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGGI) has issued a show cause notice to Binance , the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange , demanding Goods and Services Tax (GST) payment of Rs 722 crore. This marks the first time the DGGI has issued such a notice to a cryptocurrency firm, setting a significant precedent in India’s efforts to regulate the rapidly growing virtual currency market.Sources confirmed that the notice was issued to Binance for collecting fees from Indian customers trading in virtual digital assets (VDAs) on their platform, categorized under online information database access or retrieval (OIDAR) services.Earlier this year, Binance received approval from India’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) to register as a virtual asset service provider (VASP). However, the company was slapped with a Rs 18 crore penalty from the FIU last month for non-compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) regulations.Despite being a major player in the global cryptocurrency market, with at least 40% market share and operations across more than 150 countries, Binance had not registered under the Indian GST framework. This oversight has now brought the company under the scrutiny of Indian tax authorities.“Binance reportedly earned at least Rs 4,000 crore from transaction fees charged to Indian customers. The company has a user base of 90 million users globally, including a substantial number of customers from India too. Detailed investigation revealed that the earnings of these fees were credited to the account of a Binance Group Company — Nest Services Limited — based in Seychelles,” a top source privy to the development said.In fact, Binance is reportedly facing a trial in a Nigerian court for alleged tax evasion, following a crypto crackdown in the country.To make Binance compliant with the GST regulations, DGGI Ahmedabad zonal unit also sent emails to Binance group companies in Seychelles, the Cayman Islands and Switzerland, which did not elicit a response. Binance appointed a local counsel in India to liaise with the DGGI, marking the first step towards resolving this significant tax compliance issue.Sources confirmed that DGGI is also closely monitoring financial transactions and activities of online gaming platforms and marketplaces for the possibility of tax evasion.The Indian GST regime mandates that foreign service providers pay GST for services provided to Indian residents, particularly under the OIDAR category. As the investigation continues, other cryptocurrency exchanges operating both overseas and within India are also expected to face scrutiny from tax authorities, said sources.","The Ahmedabad zonal unit of the Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGGI) has issued a show cause notice to Binance.

The new offering promises lightning-fast 8-16 minute deliveries for a diverse range of products, spanning from groceries to electronics.With this move, Flipkart directly challenges established players in the booming quick commerce sector, including Swiggy's Instamart, Zomato's Blinkit , Zepto , and BigBasket's BB Now.The service, which was previously offered on a trial basis to employees at Flipkart's headquarters, is now available to users through the Flipkart app.We confirmed the service's availability by checking an address in HSR on the Flipkart app, which indeed showed Flipkart Minutes as an option for quick delivery. Additionally, several users on X (formerly Twitter) reported that Flipkart is delivering groceries and other items to their addresses in Bengaluru within minutes through the ""Minutes"" service.Sources familiar with the matter tell the Economic Times that Flipkart plans to expand the service to more areas in Bengaluru over the next few weeks.The launch of Flipkart Minutes comes at a time when other players in the quick commerce space are aggressively expanding their operations.The ET had earlier reported that Flipkart was planning to operate around 100 dark stores to bolster its quick-commerce offerings during the upcoming festive season. Dark stores, which are mini warehouses strategically located for rapid deliveries, have become a crucial component of quick commerce operations.Blinkit, for instance, recently announced ambitious plans to increase its dark store count to 2,000 by 2026. This doubles down on its earlier announced plans to have 1,000 dark stores by March 2025. Similarly, Zepto aims to double its network to 700 dark stores by March 2025. Swiggy Instamart , another major player, currently operates more than 500 such warehouses.Interestingly, Amazon, a key player in the e-commerce space, has not shown interest in the quick-commerce business in India so far. However, it does operate a grocery store service dubbed "" Amazon Fresh ,"" offering same-day delivery for groceries. This is similar to what Flipkart has also been offering through its Grocery tab.","Flipkart has launched its quick commerce service'Flipkart Minutes'in select areas of Bengaluru.

California man credits Apple Watch for saving his life: ‘I wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for this little device’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/california-man-credits-apple-watch-for-saving-his-life-i-wouldnt-be-here-if-it-wasnt-for-this-little-device/articleshow/112306053.cms,"Apple Watch detects user’s low heart rate



What doctor said

An Apple Watch user is crediting the smartwatch for saving his life after the wearable alerted him about a life-threatening condition. Peter Moore , a resident of Montecito, California shared his experience with a local news publisher KTLA. Narrating the incident, he said “I wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for this little device”.Moore, who is a former tech executive, said that he was on his way to the airport when he began to feel “a little lightheaded and a little faint”.“Like a typical male, I thought, ‘I’ll go to Starbucks. That’ll fix it,'” Moore explained before he received a notification from the Apple Watch he was wearing.“My phone started to ping and said ‘low heart rate,’ which I’d never seen before. And so I looked at it… my heart rate had dropped to 32. And it was insistent in its notifications that something wasn’t right,” said Moore. He then contacted his wife who took him to hospital.“The doctor kind of theatrically ran in and said, ‘This is not good. This is not good. You need a pacemaker right now,'” Moore said.Omid Yousefian, the cardiac electrophysiologist at Sansum Clinic Cardiology who treated Moore said “Yes, his watch had a big role in saving his life”.“These days, 25% of the population over the age of 40 … have a high chance of experiencing atrial fibrillation,” Yousefian explained.“For us physicians, symptoms are the most important thing. [Moore] was notified by his watch that his heart rate is slow and he correlated that with the symptoms that he had. So he didn’t wait. He didn’t sit. He came to the hospital directly. So he made a very smart move,” Yousefian told the publication.","Peter Moore, a former tech executive, was on his way to the airport when he began to feel “a little lightheaded and a little faint” He received a notification from the Apple Watch he was wearing that his heart rate had dropped to 32.

What exactly happened

Read the complete post here

In a shocking incident, a Supreme Court lawyer, Mukul P Unny , was scammed out of Rs 38,000 while attempting to exchange his iPhone 13 for an iPhone 15 on Amazon .in. The lawyer detailed his ordeal on social media, highlighting the fraudulent tactics employed by the delivery executive.Unny took X (formerly known as Twitter) to post about the new kind of smartphone exchange scam.The incident occurred on July 21, 2024, when Unny placed an order for the iPhone 15 on Amazon. The following day, a delivery executive arrived at his residence and handed over the new phone after receiving the necessary OTP. However, the executive then requested another OTP, claiming it was required to complete the exchange.Despite Unny's hesitation, he was convinced to return the new iPhone to the delivery executive after speaking to the latter's supervisor.Unny contacted Amazon customer care the following day to report the incident. Initially, Amazon assured him of a refund if the product was not delivered. However, subsequent inquiries revealed the case was under investigation with a resolution deadline of July 31.On July 31st, Amazon concluded its investigation and informed Unny that a refund was impossible. The company's explanation lacked substance, as they had not thoroughly verified the scam details. The fact that Unny still possessed his old iPhone directly contradicted Amazon's claim that the exchange was complete.While Amazon has eventually issued a refund to Unny, his ordeal underscores the considerable risks inherent in online transactions, even when dealing with reputable platforms like Amazon.Always verify the identity of a delivery executive before sharing your Amazon OTP. This crucial step can protect you from falling victim to scams.“This is the story of my worst experience with @amazonIN On 21.07.2024, I ordered iPhone 15 from Amazon in exchange for my iPhone 13. On 22.07.2024, the delivery executive came at around 930 PM. I gave the OTP and took the product, and gave my phone to the executive.He said I have give another OTP. I had already given the OTP and was wondering what other OTP is to be given for exchange. I said I dont have any other OTP than the one I have given. He stayed there for few minutes & then called his supervisor.After speaking with the supervisor, the delivery exec asked for return of the product since the ""exchange is not final"".I insisted that I speak with the supervisor. The supervisor tells me that the exchange is done by a different team & requests for the product to be returned. I said I cannot give away the product especially since the OTP is given and the app was showing that the product is delivered. But this supervisor Ashok (8076650306) requested me to return, lest his team will have to make for the loss.Upon his request and assurance that the product will be ""reattempted"" the next day, I gave the product to the delivery exec (Vishal 8826421956) after taking the supervisor's and the delivery exec's number. On 23.07.2024, I spoke with the Amazon Customer Care and raised a complaint to which I assured that refund will be initiated if the product is not delivered. Call centre asked me to follow up on 25.07.2024.On 26.07.2024,when I called them, the customer case asked me to wait till 31.05.2024 as ""it has to be investigated"". Today, when I call Amazon, they said ""investigation"" is complete and that refund cannot be initiated. No fact-finding was done by Amazon in this. Now, we are staring at a loss of Rs. 38000 and a possible scam done by supervisor, delivery exec and others at Amazon. If they say that the exchange is done, then they can very well see the old phone that I still use with me.This could happen to any one of you and please be aware while dealing with @amazonIN.”","Supreme Court lawyer Mukul P Unny was scammed out of Rs 38,000 while attempting to exchange his iPhone 13 for an iPhone 15 on Amazon.in.
