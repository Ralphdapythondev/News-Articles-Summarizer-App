Why Sony Music Group has sent ‘warning’ letters to 700 tech companies and music streaming services,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-sony-music-group-has-sent-warning-letters-to-700-tech-companies-and-music-streaming-services/articleshow/110187052.cms,"What Sony Music Group has to say

For that reason, SMG’s affiliates, Sony Music Publishing (SMP) and Sony Music Entertainment (SME), on behalf of themselves and their wholly owned or controlled affiliates, are making this affirmative, public declaration confirming that, except as specifically and explicitly authorized by either SME or SMP, as the case may be, each of them expressly prohibits and opts out of any text or data mining, web scraping or similar reproductions, extractions or uses (“TDM”) of any SME and/or SMP content (including, without limitation, musical compositions, lyrics, audio recordings, audiovisual recordings, artwork, images, data, etc.) for any purposes, including in relation to training, developing or commercializing any AI system, and by any means, including by bots, scrapers or other automated processes, in each case to the full extent permitted by applicable law in all relevant jurisdictions.

Sony Music Group ( SMG ) has reportedly sent letters to 700 technology companies that are developing AI tech and music streaming services warning them not to use the company’s content to train AI models without its explicit permission.The letters – recipients of which have not been disclosed – have been sent in an effort to protect its intellectual property, including album cover art, metadata, musical compositions and lyrics, from being used for training AI models , a report by Bloomberg said.The company said that the “unauthorised use” of Sony’s content in the “training, development or commercialisation of AI systems” deprives the company and its artists – which include Lil Nas X, Beyonce, Adele and Celine Dion – of control and compensation for those works.SMG said that it is a passionate believer in the paramount value of human artistry.“SMG has been embracing the potential for responsibly produced AI to be used as a creative tool, revolutionising the ways songwriters and recording artists create music. We support artists and songwriters taking the lead in embracing new technologies in support of their art. Evolutions in technology have frequently shifted the course of creative industries,” the company said in a statement.According to the company, technological innovation must ensure that songwriters’ and recording artists’ rights, including copyrights, are respected.The company has reportedly asked the recipients of the letters to provide details on which of SMG’s songs have been used to train AI systems, among other things. The recipients of the letters have been given a deadline to respond.","Sony Music Group has reportedly sent letters to 700 technology companies that are developing AI tech and music streaming services.

India is the world's 'capital' in mobile payments. The country is now the global leader in using mobile wallets , with a whopping 90.8% of its population making transactions through them in 2023, according to a survey by GlobalData. This highlights India's rapid progress in adopting digital payments.The country's Unified Payments Interface ( UPI ) continues to perform well, processing massive daily transactions.In April 2024 alone, the daily volume reached Rs 19.64 lakh crore, and the first half of May 2024 has already seen Rs 10.70 lakh crore worth of transactions.This trend isn't limited to India. The Asia-Pacific region (APAC) is also witnessing a surge in mobile wallet usage, likely accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic that pushed people towards contactless payments.Experts believe mobile wallets will significantly impact other countries as well. Ravi Sharma, an analyst at GlobalData, predicts a decline in cash transactions in Hong Kong due to the growing popularity of mobile wallets. He attributes this to factors like widespread use of QR codes , instant mobile payment systems, and consumer preference for mobile payments.The high smartphone penetration rate and a large number of adults with bank accounts in these regions create a strong foundation for mobile wallet adoption. Additionally, the presence of various domestic and international mobile wallet brands (like Apple Pay, Google Pay, PhonePe) offers consumers a wider choice. Increased acceptance by merchants further encourages people to use mobile wallets.This data is based on GlobalData's 2023 Financial Services Consumer Survey, conducted in the second quarter of 2023, which included over 50,000 participants aged 18 and above from 40 countries.","India is the world's 'capital' in mobile payments.

Toshiba has announced that it will cut up to 4,000 jobs domestically as a part of the Japanese conglomerate accelerates restructuring efforts under new ownership. The job cuts represent 6% of Toshiba’s local workforce.Toshiba delisted from the stock market in December after a $13 billion takeover by a consortium led by Japan Industrial Partners (JIP), essentially ending a decade of challenges for the company, news agency Reuters reported.Once a giant employer in Japan, Toshiba has been mired with management issues and scandals, including a hefty fine for accounting irregularities and the sale of its memory chip business, Kioxia, to cover nuclear power plant losses.The consortium's goal is to improve Toshiba's performance, which is seen as a test for private equity firms in Japan.The report also says that Toshiba is also planning to move some office functions from central Tokyo to Kawasaki, a city west of the capital. Additionally, Toshiba aims to achieve a 10% operating profit margin within three years.Private equity firms are becoming a more common option for Japanese companies looking to sell non-essential assets or struggling to find successors, Reuters said.The report of layoffs at Toshiba comes as several companies in Japan have announced job cuts, including Konica Minolta (photocopiers), Shiseido (cosmetics), and Omron (electronics) in recent months.The job cuts in Japan are considered a ‘big thing’ as it points to a shift in Japan's corporate culture, where layoffs were previously uncommon due to strong worker protection laws.The layoffs come amidst a chronic labour shortage in Japan, as companies struggle to fill open positions. Additionally, factors like rising wages, increased worker mobility, and a growing number of foreign workers are contributing to a changing workplace landscape.",Toshiba delisted from the stock market in December after a $13 billion takeover by a consortium led by Japan Industrial Partners.

Google co-founder says this is the “No. 1” use of AI today,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-co-founder-says-this-is-the-no-1-use-of-ai-today/articleshow/110183678.cms,"Google co-founder Sergey Brin made a rare appearance on Google I/O this year and talked about the “No.1” use case of AI today, company’s plans with regards to Google Glass and how he uses AI in his day-to-day life. He also mentioned GPT-4o , the latest AI model released by ChatGPT-maker OpenAI a day ahead of Google’s annual developers conference.In Brin's view, Coding is the ""No.1"" use of AI today. He says that he uses Gemini AI “a lot for coding” and that using Gemini for that purpose is “kind of extraordinary.” Even Google CEO Sundar Pichai said that he is using Gemini “to brush up on my coding skills”.Bring also recounted a colleague asked him in a debate about how good AI will be at solving Sudoku – a popular puzzle game. He said he used AI to write a code to solve Sudoku.“And I just said, 'well, why don't I see?' And I actually had it write a piece of code to generate sudoku puzzles, and then test the solutions.”“It wasn't completely flawless. But [there were] a couple of minor issues that I'd cleaned up right away. That was pretty amazing,” Brin was quoted as saying by CNET.Sergey Brin says AI hallucinations is a “big problem”While talking to a bunch of reporters on the sidelines of Google I/O, Brin said that AI hallucinations is a “big problem” but it is “shrinking” and that he “wouldn't be shocked if there were some significant advances that would really, you know, make orders-of-magnitude improvements.”AI hallucination is a term used to describe a situation where an AI chatbot provides factually incorrect answers but presents them in a way that they are correct.Reports suggested that after OpenAI and Microsoft launched their AI chatbots and services, Google issued a ‘Code Red’, which apparently prompted Brin to come back from his retirement and work with the team to shape AI.“It's just such an exciting time. With this AI boom… being a computer scientist, like, I want to be a part of that. It's just so exciting. And yeah, it's a treat,” he said, noting that AI brought him out of the brief retirement he entered prior to Covid-19.“I can't imagine a better time to be a computer scientist, and I feel super lucky to be able to see the details of how these things work,” he said.Google co-founder on launch of ChatGPT with GPT-4oA day ahead of Google I/O, OpenAI hosted a Spring Update event in which it showcased the GPT-4o AI model that enables ChatGPT users to find answers to their queries with voice, visuals and text. Google responded with “Project Astra” with similar features. Brin said that he watched OpenAI's announcement but that he didn't have a chance to play with it.","Google co-founder Sergey Brin made a rare appearance on Google I/O this year.

Google accidentally 'deletes' $125 billion account holding pension funds from Cloud; CEO says sorry,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-accidentally-deletes-125-billion-account-holding-pension-funds-from-cloud-ceo-says-sorry/articleshow/110135841.cms,"Here's the joint statement:

UniSuper and Google Cloud understand the disruption to services experienced by members has been extremely frustrating and disappointing. We extend our sincere apologies to all members.

While supporting UniSuper to bring its systems back online, Google Cloud has been conducting a root cause analysis.

Google Cloud CEO, Thomas Kurian has confirmed that the disruption arose from an unprecedented sequence of events whereby an inadvertent misconfiguration during provisioning of UniSuper’s Private Cloud services ultimately resulted in the deletion of UniSuper’s Private Cloud subscription.

This is an isolated, ‘one-of-a-kind occurrence’ that has never before occurred with any of Google Cloud’s clients globally. This should not have happened. Google Cloud has identified the events that led to this disruption and taken measures to ensure this does not happen again.

Why did the outage last so long?

UniSuper had duplication in two geographies as a protection against outages and loss. However, when the deletion of UniSuper’s Private Cloud subscription occurred, it caused deletion across both of these geographies.

Restoring UniSuper’s Private Cloud instance has called for an incredible amount of focus, effort, and partnership between our teams to enable an extensive recovery of all the core systems. The dedication and collaboration between UniSuper and Google Cloud has led to an extensive recovery of our Private Cloud which includes hundreds of virtual machines, databases and applications.

UniSuper had backups in place with an additional service provider. These backups have minimised data loss, and significantly improved the ability of UniSuper and Google Cloud to complete the restoration.

What’s next?

UniSuper and Google Cloud have been working around the clock on a resolution. The completion of the restoration swiftly, safely and securely remains Google Cloud and UniSuper’s top priority.

Australian pension fund UniSuper members faced a week-long outage due to an accidental deletion of their private cloud account by Google Cloud . This impacted over half a million people who couldn't access their superannuation accounts.Service restoration began on Thursday, but it might take some time for investment balances to reflect current figures.UniSuper assured members they're working on a swift update.UniSuper CEO, Peter Chun, reached out to members via email on Wednesday. He clarified that the incident wasn't a cyberattack and there was no data breach either. Chun pinpointed a Google Cloud configuration error as the culprit behind the outage.The outage reportedly lasted for an extended period of time as the subscription was deleted, taking with it UniSuper's two geographies that were intended to provide protection against outages and loss. Fortunately, UniSuper had backups in place with a different service provider. UniSuper is said to have moved a large amount of its workloads to Google Cloud Platform in 2023, having previously split them between Azure and two of its own data centers.In a rare move, UniSuper and Google Cloud issued a joint apology. In a joint statement with UniSuper CEO Peter Chun , Google CEO Thomas Kurian admitted that an ""inadvertent misconfiguration"" during the provisioning of UniSuper's Private Cloud services resulted in the deletion of the data.","Australian pension fund UniSuper members faced a week-long outage due to an accidental deletion of their private cloud account by Google Cloud.

The OS will also detect suspicious activities, such as attempts to disconnect your phone or multiple failed log-in attempts, and automatically lock the device to deter theft.Under the hood, Android 15 brings numerous efficiency improvements to optimise app performance and battery life. Foreground services now have a 6-hour limit on dataSync and media processing, pushing them to the background after the time limit to conserve power. The introduction of 16KB page support reduces power draw during app launch and improves camera app opening speed.For users with larger-screen devices like the Pixel Tablet, Android 15 offers enhanced multitasking capabilities. Pin the taskbar, quickly switch between apps, and save preferred split-screen combinations for a seamless navigation experience.Android 15's Predictive Back feature uses animations to show users exactly where the back button will take them, eliminating the frustration of accidentally navigating to the wrong screen. Apps can now provide a Remote View to the Widget Picker, allowing users to preview widgets before placing them on their home screens.Android 15 extends platform support for satellite connectivity, providing a consistent user experience across the satellite connectivity landscape. Apps can now detect when a device is connected to a satellite, giving them more awareness of why complete network services may be unavailable. SMS and RCS apps can also send and receive messages via satellite connectivity.Android 15 introduces app archiving, a feature that allows users to free up storage space by offloading most of an app while retaining user settings and saving data. This feature will be accessible through the Settings app, making it easy for users to manage their device storage.Android 15 upgrades the Find My Device feature, allowing users to locate items like keys, wallets, or luggage using Bluetooth tracker tags from various manufacturers. This enhancement makes it easier for users to keep track of their belongings and find them quickly when misplaced.The Health Connect platform in Android 15 now supports additional health and fitness data types, such as skin temperature and training plans, enabling more comprehensive tracking and analysis.Android 15 introduces new extensions that give developers more control over camera hardware on supported devices. Low-light enhancements give developers control over boosting the brightness of the camera preview, while advanced flash strength adjustments enable precise control of flash intensity when capturing photos.With Android 15, users can share or record just an app window rather than the entire device screen. This feature, previously enabled on Pixel devices, will now be available across the broader Android platform, ensuring that sensitive information remains private during screen-sharing sessions.Android 15 brings several improvements to notifications and customization. Users can now set rich vibrations for incoming notifications by channel, allowing them to distinguish between different types of notifications without looking at their devices. The OS also introduces a new ""colour contrast"" settings page, enabling users to adjust the contrast of text, buttons, and icons in apps for better visibility.There is a new Bluetooth Quick Settings tile that lets users toggle individual connections to connect and disconnect specific devices. The OS also supports the CTA-2075 loudness standard, helping app developers avoid loudness inconsistencies and ensuring users don't have to adjust volume when switching between content constantly.Soon, Google Maps will enable users to access augmented reality (AR) content directly on their phones, providing immersive ways to learn about locations. AR experiences for places like Singapore and Paris are in the works, laying the foundation for an extended reality (XR) platform.Android 15 Beta 2 is now available on these phones – Google Pixel 6 onwards, OnePlus 12, OnePlus 12, Vivo X100, iQoo 12, Nothing 2(a), and select phones from Honor, Lenovo, Nothing, OnePlus, OPPO, Realme, Sharp, Tecno, and Xiaomi.The stable release of Android 15 is expected in late summer or early fall, possibly coinciding with the launch of the Pixel 9 series.","Google has announced Android 15, releasing the beta 2 to developers.

Network compatibility: Confirm that the phone is unlocked or compatible with your network carrier. Some phones are locked to specific carriers, limiting your options.

Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max: 4 new camera features Apple may add to iPhone 16 Pro models,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/mobiles-tabs/4-new-camera-features-apple-may-add-to-iphone-16-pro-models/articleshow/110057298.cms,"Upgraded ultra-wide cameras



Tetra-prism lens for iPhone 16 Pro



Improved lens flare control



New Sony primary sensor for improved low-light photography



Apple is expected to launch the iPhone 16 series later this year in September. The upcoming lineup may include four smartphone models -- the iPhone 16, the iPhone 16 Plus, the iPhone 16 Pro and the iPhone 16 Pro Max. The Pro variants in the upcoming iPhone lineup are rumoured to bring new features like larger displays, a dedicated Capture button and more.According to a recent report by 9to5Mac, the Cupertino-based tech giant is also expected to add multiple noticeable improvements to the camera hardware of the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max models. Here are four new camera upgrades that may arrive with iPhone 16 Pro smartphones:Rumours suggest the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max may get an upgraded 48MP Ultra Wide camera this year. This is expected to be a major improvement from the current 12 MP Ultra Wide camera in the iPhone 15 Pro models.This upgrade is expected to offer improved performance in various shooting scenarios, particularly in low-light conditions. Images captured with the new Ultra-Wide camera are likely to show greater details and enhanced colour accuracy. The higher resolution will also provide increased flexibility during editing and post-processing.Furthermore, the 48MP Ultra Wide camera in the iPhone 16 Pro may also lead to significant advancements in spatial video recording. This feature, which utilises both the Main and Ultra Wide lenses, may enable the iPhone 16 Pro to record spatial video in 4K resolution. To compare, the iPhone 15 Pro is limited to recording spatial video at 1080p resolution.The current iPhone 15 Pro Max features a new tetra-prism camera design which offers 5x optical zoom and 25x digital zoom capabilities. With the upcoming iPhone 16 lineup, Apple is reportedly planning to extend this upgraded tetra-prism camera to the smaller iPhone 16 Pro model as well. This means both the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max will offer at least 5x optical zoom and 25x digital zoom.Rumours also suggest that the iPhone 16 Pro Max might feature a “periscope ultra-long telephoto combination.” This technology could potentially enable optical zoom greater than 5x.A common issue faced by most iPhone users is capturing lens flare while shooting in bright lighting conditions. This results in unexpected artefacts and internal reflections showing on images. While this problem is prevalent across most cameras on the market, Apple is reportedly working on a solution for the iPhone 16 Pro.According to rumours, Apple is testing a new ""atomic layer deposition"" (ALD) lens coating technology for the iPhone 16 Pro models. This anti-reflective coating could be applied to the iPhone 16 Pro's camera lenses to reduce the impact of internal reflections.If this rumour is true, users can expect fewer unexpected artefacts in images captured with the iPhone 16 Pro, particularly in bright lighting scenarios.The iPhone 16 Pro is expected to feature a new main camera sensor from Sony, which is designed to improve low-light performance.As per the report, Sony's latest stacked sensor technology separates the photodiodes and pixel transistors (which are usually combined into a single layer). This separation will allow the photodiodes responsible for capturing light to be significantly larger within the same overall pixel size.Sony claims that this new sensor will capture twice as much light as existing camera sensors. The increased light capture and reduced noise are expected to offer improved photos for iPhone users in all conditions.However, it remains uncertain whether this next-generation Sony sensor will be utilised in both iPhone 16 Pro models. A tipster on the Chinese social media platform Weibo suggested that only the iPhone 16 Pro Max may feature this upgraded stacked camera sensor hardware.","Apple is expected to launch the iPhone 16 series later this year in September.

How were they caught



US-based multinational shipping and courier service, United Parcel Service ( UPS ) has reportedly used fake iPhones , AirPods, and other Apple products to seize its employees who were allegedly stealing from customers instead of delivering their goods. According to the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office (PBSO), four men who were involved in this alleged courier stealing were caught by the police and they are part of a larger criminal conspiracy, reports Bocanewsnow.The defendants, Joseph Nunnally, Payton Brooker and Christopher Ventress have been charged with an organised scheme to defraud.Meanwhile, the fourth defendant, Fouad Saleh has been charged with grand theft, obtaining property by fraud, tampering with physical evidence, and dealing in stolen property. All four arrested UPS employees live in Palm Beach County Florida, US.As per multiple arrest reports filed by PBSO detectives, these men were involved in a scheme to intercept roughly $52,000 worth of iPhones and other Apple products in South Florida.The men allegedly created “ghost labels” while in a UPS facility in Palm Beach County that used addresses flagged by a UPS security system.UPS’ loss prevention system notified the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office which then intercepted the already stolen phones. Detectives placed trackers in the boxes which included several fake phones and then watched as the phones (along with the trackers) were delivered to an address in West Palm Beach.The people at the address then took the phones to Boost Mobile. It was unclear whether they then attempted to sell the phones to the retail store or have the phones activated to resell. While they were in Boost Mobile with the tracked phones, PBSO detectives moved in and took everyone into custody.","UPS allegedly used fake iPhones, AirPods, and other Apple products to seize its employees who were allegedly stealing from customers.

During summer months, many households experience a significant increase in electricity consumption due to higher cooling needs. While staying comfortable during hot weather is essential, it doesn't have to come at the cost of soaring electricity bills. By implementing strategic energy-saving practices, you can reduce your summer electricity expenses without sacrificing comfort.Here you can explore several effective ways to save on summer electricity bills, offering practical tips and strategies that can help you minimise energy consumption and lower your utility costs during the warmer months.From optimising your cooling system to adopting energy-efficient habits, these recommendations are designed to make a noticeable impact on your electricity expenses while keeping your home cool and comfortable.Let's delve into these actionable tips that can help you save money and energy throughout the summer season.The Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) issues BEE Star Labels as a voluntary method for manufacturers to indicate an appliance's energy efficiency. The label uses stars to indicate the efficiency of a product, with more stars indicating higher efficiency. Simply put, the higher the energy efficiency rating of the appliance, the lower its energy consumption. To effectively reduce your home's energy costs, opt for appliances with a 5-star BEE rating. Not only does this positively impact the environment, but it also helps lower your electricity bills. Explore Crompton's wide range of 5-star rated ceiling fans to learn more about BEE Rating Appliances.If your home still uses CFLs and incandescent bulbs, it's time to replace them with LED bulbs. LED bulbs are not just a trendy choice; they are recognized for their energy efficiency and superior illumination. If you're wondering how to reduce your electricity bill at home, switching to LED bulbs is the solution for you.Upgrading to smart appliances is a highly effective method to decrease electricity consumption at home. These devices allow you to automate tasks and manage energy usage efficiently. Consider installing energy-efficient ceiling fans to further reduce electricity consumption. Smart appliances typically come equipped with remote control capabilities, allowing you to schedule operations and conserve power. Crompton offers remote-controlled fans designed for enhanced energy savings and lower power consumption.These energy-efficient fans are gaining popularity due to their brushless direct current motors (BLDC), which operate on direct current electricity. They can help save up to 60% on electricity compared to normal induction motor-based fans. Additionally, they offer convenient features like remote control for turning the fan on and off, timer functionality, and compatibility with voice assistants. To learn more about the differences between BLDC fans and normal fans and how they can help reduce electricity bills, explore further information on BLDC fans versus conventional fans.Implementing a full solar power system for your home can be a substantial investment. However, there are more accessible and cost-effective ways to leverage solar energy. Installing outdoor solar lights in your balcony and garden, along with solar fans, can notably reduce your energy expenses at a modest cost. Additionally, using solar pumps for daily tasks can contribute to electricity savings. It's beneficial to understand the distinction between an electric geyser and a solar geyser to make an informed choice for your energy needs.Maintain your air conditioner at 24 degrees Celsius to optimise cooling and conserve energy during the summer months, effectively lowering electricity costs. Additionally, using a timer to automate AC operation and upgrading to a 5-star BEE-rated model can further enhance energy efficiency and reduce expenses associated with cooling your space.Numerous advanced smart energy metres are currently offered in the market. These metres typically use Wi-Fi connectivity to monitor overall power usage within a home and provide real-time analysis of consumption patterns. Additionally, they can detect power leaks and identify high-energy-consuming appliances. Wi-Fi LED bulbs represent an excellent choice for reducing electricity usage.Regularly servicing and maintaining your home appliances is essential for optimal functionality and efficiency. Appliances that are not properly maintained are known to consume excessive energy, so routine maintenance can prolong their lifespan and reduce energy consumption. Learn more about the importance of cleaning exhaust fans.Install a power strip if you have several electronic devices or appliances that need to be plugged into a single electrical outlet. This allows you to easily turn off all devices at once when they are not in use, preventing unnecessary energy consumption often referred to as ""phantom"" energy loss.One of the simplest and most effective methods to lower electricity costs is by turning off electrical devices such as lights, fans, and air conditioners when they are not in use.","During summer months, many households experience a significant increase in electricity consumption due to higher cooling needs.
