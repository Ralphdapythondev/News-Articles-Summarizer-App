"Infosys’ Narayana Murthy, Mark Zuckerberg and 3 other tech leaders who spoke against work from home policy",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/infosys-narayana-murthy-mark-zuckerberg-and-3-other-tech-leaders-who-spoke-against-work-from-home-policy/articleshow/112612422.cms,"NR Narayana Murthy, Infosys, co-founder

Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook co-founder and Meta CEO

Elon Musk, Tesla CEO and X owner

Marc Benioff, Salesforce CEO

Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt recently said that Google has fallen behind the AI race because of its remote work policy – a remark for which he later expressed regret. However, he is not the only tech leader who has said that remote work has a negative influence on productivity. These leaders include Infosys co-founder Narayana Murthy , Facebook-parent Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Tesla CEO Elon Musk , who have expressed concerns about the long-term viability of remote work.A notable mention is Schmidt who argued that remote work policy hindered Google's ability to innovate at the same pace as its competitors.“Google decided that work-life balance and going home early and working from home was more important than winning,” Schmidt said. However, Google requires in-person employee attendance for three-days-a-week.Here are 5 tech leaders who have thrown their weight behind and have publicly advocated for work from office, arguing that it fosters innovation, collaboration and company culture..At the Asia Economic Dialogue in Pune in February 2023, NR Narayana Murthy emphasised that “laziness” must be dealt with.“Please don't fall into this trap of ‘I will moonlight, I will do work from home , I will come to office three days in a week’,"" the tech leader said.Last year OpenAI CEO Sam Altman told Fortune Magazine that he believed one of the tech industry's “worst mistakes” was to allow employees to go ""full remote forever.”“I would say that the experiment on that is over, and the technology is not yet good enough that people can be full remote forever, particularly on startups,” he told the magazine. The company, just like Google, the ChatGPT-maker also requires three days a week in-person attendance.Zuckerberg has also said that “people who work from home are not efficient and engineers who come to the office get more work done.”In 2023, Meta reportedly reversed the work-from-home policy, mandating that employees return to the office for at least three days a week.In 2023, Elon Musk called remote work ""morally wrong"" during an interview with CNBC.“I think that the whole notion of work from home is a bit like the fake Marie Antoinette quote, ’Let them eat cake’. It’s not just a productivity thing. I think it’s morally wrong,” Musk said.He added that engineers in the Silicon Valley are a part of “laptop classes living in la-la land” and said they should get off “their moral high horse work-from-home bulls***.”Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff last year told MSNBC that he loves remote work.“I'm a remote worker. I've always been a remote worker my whole life. I don't work well in an office,” he said.“For my people that's my message. They need to mix in person and remote together. Our engineers are extremely productive at home. We have lots of people who are extremely productive at home. But there also has to be sales people being productive in the office selling to customers and we need to make it all work,” Benioff said.","Infosys co-founder Narayana Murthy, Facebook-parent Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Tesla CEO Elon Musk have expressed concerns about the long-term viability of remote work.

How Apple may be behind 900%-plus jump in this Tata Group company’s revenue,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-apple-may-be-behind-900-plus-jump-in-this-tata-group-companys-revenue/articleshow/112719132.cms,"Apple ’s expanding business in India has catalysed significant growth at Tata Electronics, propelling the homegrown company to a pivotal position within the global smartphone manufacturing industry. According to recent filings with the Registrar of Companies (RoC), as reported by The Economic Times, Tata Electronics witnessed an astounding ninefold increase in sales year-on-year, with revenues soaring to ₹3,802 crore in the previous fiscal year, up from ₹401 crore in FY23.This exponential growth can be largely attributed to Tata's strategic acquisition of Wistron 's iPhone assembly plant near Bengaluru, completed in March 2024. This move integrated Tata Electronics into Apple's global supply chain, establishing it as India's sole homegrown iPhone assembler.Looking ahead, Tata Electronics is poised for further expansion. The company is reportedly planning to establish a new iPhone assembly unit in Hosur, Tamil Nadu, with a substantial investment of ₹6,000 crore. This facility is expected to commence operations in November 2024 (Economic Times).Asides a newer facility, Financial Express had reported earlier this year that Tata Electronics was in talks to acquire a majority stake in Pegatron's India factory, another of Apple's contract manufacturers. The deal was expected post Lok Sabha Elections, by July-August, but so far there has been no word on it. If Tata closes on it, it could help the group further solidify its relations with Apple.Meanwhile, Apple is preparing to manufacture its high-end iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max models in India for the first time this year, and that could further help Tata Electronics boost its financials . Bloomberg reports that Foxconn's factory in Tamil Nadu is already training workers to produce these premium devices, but soon Tata’s facility could also begin assembling Pro models, which per report, would mainly be exported outside of India.During a recent earnings call, Apple CEO Tim Cook underscored the company's success in India. He stated, ""We set quarterly revenue records in more than two dozen countries and regions, including... India,"" highlighting the increasing significance of the Indian market in Apple's global strategy.","Tata Electronics witnessed an astounding ninefold increase in sales year-on- year.

iPhone users in EU to get more control over default apps,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/iphone-users-in-eu-to-get-more-control-over-default-apps/articleshow/112719066.cms,"Users can also delete Messages, Camera, and other core Apple apps

After introducing alternative app stores, now Apple is losing its grip over the default apps in the European Union, under the Digital Markets Act . iPhone and iPad users in the 27-nation bloc will soon be able to change the default apps for phone calls, messaging, and other core functions . This marks a significant shift in Apple's historically closed ecosystem approach.The changes, coming later this year in iOS 18 , will allow EU users to set third-party apps as the default for phone, messaging, keyboards, password managers, and call spam filters.In spring 2025, Apple plans to extend this to navigation and translation apps as well.A new ""Default Apps"" section in Settings will give users a centralised place to manage these preferences. This expands on existing options to change default browsers and email apps that Apple introduced in 2020.Additionally, EU users will be able to delete previously unremovable core apps like the App Store, Messages, Camera, Photos, and Safari. Only the Settings and Phone apps will remain undeletable.These changes come as Apple works to comply with the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA), which aims to increase competition in digital markets. The company has already opened up its App Store to third-party marketplaces in the EU, withEpic Games launching its store on iOS last week.Apple is also tweaking its browser choice screen that appears when EU users first open Safari. The new design will require users to scroll through all options before selecting, and will display more information about each browser.While these changes only apply to EU users for now, they could potentially expand to other regions in the future, as regulators worldwide scrutinise big tech companies' practices, including that of Apple.","iPhone and iPad users in the 27-nation bloc will soon be able to change the default apps for phone calls, messaging, and other core functions.

Zomato has announced the shutdown of its ' Legends ' service, which offers iconic dishes from various Indian cities. The decision follows a temporary suspension which was imposed by the company on the service earlier this year. Despite Zomato’s efforts to make the 'Legends' service successful, the company's inability to meet market demands led to the decision to terminate the service.Launched in 2021, 'Legends' aimed to deliver renowned local cuisine to customers across the country.In an X post, Zomato CEO Deepinder Goyal confirmed the company’s decision. He said: ""After two years of trying and not finding product-market fit, we have decided to shut down the service with immediate effect.""The Zomato Legends service allowed customers to order an item from a city far away. For example, this service allowed users to order biryani from a restaurant in Kolkata sitting in Delhi.After temporarily suspending it in April, Zomato restarted the ‘Intercity Legends’ service last month. The company also increased the minimum order value to Rs 5,000 to make each delivery more profitable than earlier.In July, Zomato suspended its hyperlocal goods delivery service 'Xtreme' which was launched a year ago. With this service, the food delivery platform wanted to compete with intracity small package delivery service providers Shadowfax, Porter and Loadshare. The company also removed the dedicated Xtreme app from the Google Play Store.This service aimed to leverage Zomato's existing delivery network to provide intracity package deliveries across nearly all of the 750-800 cities where the company offers food delivery service.In a statement to The Economic Times, a company executive said that the Xtreme service is being discontinued on account of poor demand.“It was an experiment...a lot of restaurants do direct delivery and the company's feedback was that restaurants wanted a similar quality of experience for direct deliveries. That was the basis on which Xtreme was rolled out. But it was always an experiment and could have swung either way,” the company executive noted.","Zomato has announced the shutdown of its'Legends'service, which offers iconic dishes from various Indian cities.

According to The Verge's Command Line newsletter, both companies will unveil their new AR devices at separate events in September.Snap CEO Evan Spiegel is expected to reveal the fifth generation of Spectacles on September 17 at the annual Partner Summit in Los Angeles.Just over a week later, on September 25, Meta's Mark Zuckerberg will debut the company's first AR glasses , codenamed Orion , at the Connect conference in Menlo Park.Despite the high-profile announcements, neither company plans to make these devices available for public purchase. The Command Line newsletter reports that Snap will produce fewer than 10,000 units, distributing them to select developers and partners, similar to their strategy in 2021. Meta is manufacturing even fewer of its Orion glasses.The limited production is largely due to the high costs associated with manufacturing these advanced devices. Snap's latest Spectacles are expected to cost several thousand dollars per unit to produce, while Meta's Orion glasses reportedly required billions in development costs.Both companies are grappling with the challenge of making AR technology ready for mainstream adoption. The new Spectacles are said to feature improvements over the previous generation, including a larger field of view and longer battery life.

Tensor G4, Gemini and more AI inside

Upgraded cameras with the new 'Add me' AI feature for photos

Google has launched its second-generation Pixel foldable phone, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold , which is its first-ever foldable phone in India. The second-gen Pixel Fold upgrades on some salient aspects over the first one. Per Google, the foldable is slim, super durable, and has a brighter screen, both on the outside and inside. And, the phone also packs in Pixel’s “fastest, most powerful” Tensor G4 chip , bringing on-device multimodal capabilities to the phone.On the inside, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold comes equipped with an 8 inches ‘Super Actua Flex display,’ an LTPO panel with a 2922x1344 resolution at 486 PPI. The inner screen has a dynamic refresh rate of 1-120Hz and can go as bright as 3,000 nits, which Google says is 80% brighter than the screen on the first-gen Pixel Fold. To make use of phone’s large inner canvas, there’s a split-screen mode that’ll let you use two apps side-by-side.When unfolded, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold can be used a regular phone with a 6.3 inches outer screen, which has the same specs as the inner screen.Google says that the Pixel 9 Pro Fold has an “all-new” hinge that is made from stainless steel and has an aerospace grade aluminium alloy cover. The hinge has a polished finish, while the back has the silky matt finish. The phone is rated IPX8 for water resistivity. And there’s Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the outside.Powering the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is Google’s Tensor G4 chip, also found on the other three Pixel 9 phones. The chip comes paired with 16GB of RAM and up to 1TB storage. Then, there’s theTitan M2 security coprocessor , which enables multi-layer hardware security.There’s a 5,060mAh battery, which Google promises will last for over 24 hours and up to 100 hours with Extreme Battery Saver. The phone supports fast charging at 45W, which should fill up the battery up to 55% in about 30 minutes. FYI, the charger isn’t included in the box. The phone also supports Qi wireless charging and Battery Share, i.e., reverse wireless charging.Out-of-the-box the Pixel 9 Pro Fold will come with Android 14 . There’s the usual Google promise of 7 years of OS and security updates.Would it even be a Pixel phone, if there’s no AI in it. Well, there’s a whole lot of AI. For starters Gemini is there, and it works in split-screen mode, as well. One could ask Gemini to write stuff or even get info about whats’s on the screen or photos. Circle To Search is also there, ohh and this feature can help you check if an image has been created using AI.The new “Pixel-exclusive” AI feature to arrive is Pixel Screenshots. The feature could organise or recall things, like events and location, all you need to is ask the phone.Google is giving one year of the Google One AI Premium plan for free to those who’ll buy the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. So, that’ll give you access to Gemini Advanced, Gemini in Gmail and Docs, on top of 2TB of cloud storage.The Pixel 9 Pro Fold ditches the camera visor for a squircle module that houses a triple lens setup – a 50MP wide camera, a 48MP ultraide and a 48MP 5x telephoto camera. For selfies, there's a 42 MP front-facing camera on the inner screen and 10MP camera on the outside.The camera hardware has been only a part of Pixel’s camera, but it’s AI that completes it. There’s a long list of AI features that complements the camera hardware on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. The usual Super Res Zoom, Zoom Enhance, Video Boost, Face Unblur, Photo Unblur, Best Take, Magic Eraser, Audio Eraser, and Magic Editor makes their return. Well, Magic Eraser now has an a “reimagine” feature that Google says can give photos a “whole new look.”One new AI tool to come to Google’s Pixel 9 pro Fold is the “Add Me,” which as you’d image can add you to a picture. So, how does it work? Well, you take photo with the group, swap in yourself, and AI will merge the photos.Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold is priced in India at Rs 1,72,999 and will be available for purchase later this year. While it comes in two colours – Obsidian and Porcelain – it’ll be available only in Obsidian colour in India.","Google has launched its second-generation Pixel foldable phone, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold.

GM recently faced a few software incidents

General Motors is laying off more than 1,000 salaried employees globally in its software and services division, the company confirmed on Monday. The job cuts , which include about 600 positions at GM's tech campus near Detroit, come as part of a review to streamline operations in the unit.""As we build GM's future, we must simplify for speed and excellence, make bold choices, and prioritise the investments that will have the greatest impact,"" GM said in a statement to CNBC.The layoffs represent approximately 1.3% of GM's global salaried workforce of 76,000 as of the end of 2023. The cuts primarily affect the automaker's US operations. Impacted employees were notified Monday morning.""We are grateful to those who helped establish a strong foundation that positions GM to lead moving forward,"" the automaker added in its statement.""As a result, we're reducing certain teams within the Software and Services organisation,"" GM stated. The division, currently led by executives Baris Cetinok and Dave Richardson, covers areas such as vehicle infotainment, OnStar services, and GM's Super Cruise advanced driver-assist system.The change comes less than six months after leadership shifts in the unit, including the departure of former Apple executive Mike Abbott in March due to health reasons.The job cuts follow GM's efforts to reduce costs amid industry concerns of a potential downturn and significant investments in electric vehicles and software-defined vehicles. GM has recently faced challenges with software issues in its new Chevy Blazer EV, including blank infotainment screens and charging error messages. The company issued a stop sale notice last December due to these problems, which was lifted in March.The layoffs also come after GM cancelled its ""Ultra Cruise"" programme, a competitor to Tesla's Full Self-Driving system, in January.

“Saar your mum after I do my shift at Uber screams that at night btw saar, please saar, harder saar, I spit on the bitch and all she says is thaank sou saar. I don't shower saar and women don't talk to me saar. I work at Tim Hortons saar.”

“Believe it or not, I just don't like India. Also I can sense an Indian, he is Indian. If a man online suddenly talks about ducking your mother in the first response, he's Indian. Many such cases.”

A UK-based YouTuber named Miles Routledge has faced backlash after he made several racist remarks targeting Indians on the social media platform X (earlier Twitter). It all started with a meme video that he uploaded on X as a joke. The video showed alleged nuclear missiles coming out of hidden silos in the US and a worldwide nuclear war.While sharing the video he wrote: “When I become prime minister of England, I'll open the nuclear silos as an explicit warning to any foreign power that interferes with British interests and affairs.I'm not talking huge incidents, I'm itching to launch and atomise entire nations over the smallest infraction.”A few minutes later Routledge added a comment to the post as he said: “Hell, I might just launch at India just for the sake of it!”After sharing the post, he also responded to the comments made from a troll account which is now unavailable.“Saar I will see you soon saar,” Routledge said replying to the troll's commentsIn another reply, Routledge wrote:He also started receiving threatening DMs from the troll. Assuming that the trolling account may belong to an Indian, he started replying to the X profile with racist remarks against Indians. He shared a screenshot of DMs shared between him and the troll.“Indian threatens to find me, it backfires lmao,” he wrote captioning the screenshot. The image also included the YouTuber’s location and description of his clothes as he challenged the troll to come find him. Since then, the post has received more than 5 million views.In separate posts, he also shared his entire conversation as well as the profile details of the trolling account (which later became unavailable) on the platform.Here’s the full conversation between Routledge and the troll:Routledge’s remarks against Indians have drawn criticism.

In a surprising verdict, a Pune district court has dismissed a 13-year-old lawsuit filed by the American fast-food chain Burger King Corporation against a locally-owned eatery with the same name. The US company had accused the Pune-based Burger King of trademark infringement and sought a permanent injunction, damages, and a halt to the use of the name. The court dismissed the lawsuit filed by the Burger King Corporation in 2011, seeking a permanent injunction restraining infringement of trademark.However, the court ruled in favor of the local eatery, stating that it had been operating under the name ""Burger King"" since 1991-92, well before the US chain entered the Indian market.The plaintiff's first Indian BURGER KING restaurant was opened in New Delhi on November 9, 2014, the court said.The court found no evidence to support Burger King Corporation's claim that customers were confused or misled by the local eatery's use of the name. Additionally, the company failed to prove any actual financial loss due to the alleged infringement. The court said the Burger King Corporation has ""miserably failed"" to prove that the eatery here had infringed its trademark Burger King while running the restaurant in Pune.Burger King filed the lawsuit against Anahita Irani and Shapoor Irani. The Iranis opposed the suit, saying it was filed with malafide intentions and to discourage business people who are bonafide users and retailers. They said that apart from the name Burger King, there was absolutely no similarity in the plaintiff's trademark and their own shop name.This decision may have implications for trademark disputes involving established local businesses and multinational corporations.The Pune-based restaurant owners had counterclaimed for damages due to the harassment they endured during the lengthy legal battle. They sought Rs 20 lakh as damages. The court, however, refused any monetary relief to them too, noting that apart from oral evidence, no other proof was submitted to substantiate their claims.","Pune court dismisses 13-year-old lawsuit filed by Burger King Corporation.
