The startup whose CTO was killed by Hamas raises funding; what CEO said on the loss and 'way forward',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/the-startup-whose-cto-was-killed-by-hamas-raises-funding-what-ceo-said-on-the-loss-and-way-forward/articleshow/110548357.cms,"Carrying forward Sefi Genis’ legacy

The journey started in 2021

On October 7, cloud asset management startup Firefly lost one of its founding members, CTO Sefi Genis , in the brutal attack by Hamas at the Nova Music Festival. Seven months later, the company announced the completion of a $23 million Series A. The company's customers reportedly include Cisco, AppsFlyer, ZoomInfo, HPE, and numerous Fortune 500 companies.In a conversation with Calcalist, CEO and co-founder Ido Neeman reflected on the loss. “Sefi was one of the closest people to me, a friend and partner on a personal level,” Naaman shared. “It hurts every day, but we are not in mourning. We are building Sefi's legacy.”“In the early days, we did not know if we would survive. I was called up for reserve service for 60 days and Eran managed the company and ensured we kept moving forward,” Neeman said. According to the Calcalist report, the Series A round is led by Vertex and includes participation from Hanaco, SoftBank and Redseed. It reportedly brings the total investment in Firefly to approximately $30 million.Neeman noted that he wants to honor Sefi’s memory by building a great company. “We will honor Sefi’s name by building a large and successful company. We are not a commemorative enterprise but a hungry and very successful startup. I want us to be like Akamai, whose founder was killed in a terrorist act, and from there it became a huge company.”Firefly was founded in 2021, during the digital transformation surge of Covid-19 Pandemic. As the COVID-19 pandemic forced businesses to rapidly embrace remote work and online services, this shift to the cloud presented a golden opportunity for flexibility and efficiency, but it also created a new challenge: managing a sprawl of digital assets.","Cloud asset management startup Firefly lost one of its founding members, CTO Sefi Genis, in the brutal attack by Hamas at the Nova Music Festival.

Temu's International Expansion:

China has a new online shopping giant. According to a report in CNBC, quoting Goldman Sachs , PDD, the company behind the popular Pinduoduo shopping app, has surged past Alibaba to become China's most valuable e-commerce company. This shift comes thanks to PDD's focus on value for money and the rapid growth of its international marketplace, Temu. Incidentally, Temu was the most-downloaded shopping app in the US in 2023.Also, this isn't the first time that PDPP has surpassed Alibaba. However, it comes after a brief period where Alibaba regained the top spot. PDD's strong financial performance, with net income tripling year-over-year, combined with Alibaba's struggles, solidified the shift.Fueled by strong first-quarter results, PDD's market capitalization reached $208 billion, surpassing Alibaba's $196 billion. PDD's stock price has also doubled in the past year. Analysts point to several factors behind PDD's success:A new business model with lower logistics costs is expected to boost Temu's profitability faster than anticipated.Consumers see PDD as a reliable source for deals, placing it ahead of competitors like JD.com and Alibaba in a recent survey.The platform's popularity, fueled by its ""shop like a billionaire"" marketing campaign, is driving growth in the US, Europe, and Australia.Analysts at Goldman Sachs upgraded PDD's rating to ""buy,"" citing its advertising potential and Temu's untapped value. They believe the market has already factored in concerns about competition and political tensions. Meanwhile, Alibaba's net income saw a drastic decline compared to the previous year. This highlights the changing landscape of China's e-commerce market, where PDD's value-driven approach is resonating with consumers.","PDD, the company behind the popular Pinduoduo shopping app, has surged past Alibaba to become China's most valuable e-commerce company.

"Indian IT companies witnessing 'silent layoffs': What the industry body says, number of job cuts and more",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/indian-it-companies-witnessing-silent-layoffs-what-the-industry-body-says-number-of-job-cuts-and-more/articleshow/110543957.cms,"What are these 'silent layoffs'

In what can be termed as almost a first, the top six information technology services companies in India reported a reduction in their total headcount in the last fiscal year (FY 2023-24). The big names include TCS, Infosys, LTI-Mindtree, Tech Mahindra and Wipro; with only HCLTech adding employees. The factors contributing to this reduction are said to include the economic slowdown, automation, restructuring, and decreased discretionary spending. Some analysts also say that the drop in headcount reflects the aftermath of excessive hiring during the Covid-19 boom and ongoing industry contraction in demand.The tough job scenario in Indian IT companies mirrors that being witnessed in the global technology industry. Almost all global IT giants -- Apple, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook, IBM, Intel, SAP and others -- have announced job cuts in the last 12-18 months. The hiring too is either on freeze in most of these companies or is very limited. The tech startup scene in India as well as across the globe is no different. Several of the biggest startups have seen job cuts, many have shut shop and some seen their valuation fall by over 50% or more.Now according to a report in Money Control, the Indian IT and ITeS sector is witnessing ' silent layoffs '. The report quotes a report by the All India IT & ITeS Employees’ Union (AIITEU) that claims that approximately 20,000 technology professionals were affected by unannounced layoffs in 2023. The union reportedly suspects the actual figures could be higher. These job cuts spanned across various IT companies, irrespective of their size.According to the report, a prevalent method of these ‘silent’ layoffs involves giving employees a 30-day period to secure a different position within the company. Failure to do so results in their termination.AIITEU claims that this practice of 'silent layoffs', where employees are subtly pressured into resigning, has been adopted by numerous companies. Another industry body, Nascent Information Technology Employees Senate (NITES) claims, as per the report, that in the first five months of 2024 alone, between 2,000 and 3,000 employees have been laid off from leading Indian IT service companies.Harpreet Singh Saluja, President of NITES, told Money ontrol that companies employ various strategies to dismiss employees, and those who oppose are immediately terminated. Being marked as “terminated” on one’s release documents significantly hinders future employment opportunities.Saubhik Bhattacharya, General Secretary of AIITEU, added that employees are sometimes required to sign non-disclosure agreements to receive their complete severance packages.","The top six information technology services companies in India reported a reduction in their total headcount in the last fiscal year (FY 2023-24) The factors contributing to this reduction are said to include the economic slowdown, automation, restructuring, and decreased discretionary spending.

How AI chipmaker Nvidia may threaten this 'valuable' position of Apple,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-ai-chipmaker-nvidia-may-threaten-apples-tech-titan-status/articleshow/110543272.cms,"What triggered the rally

Will Nvidia beat Apple to No. 3

Nvidia 's stock price surged on Tuesday (May 28), reaching a record high and pushing the company's market value closer to Apple, the current tech leader. Fueled by strong earnings and a bright future in artificial intelligence ( AI ), Nvidia's shares jumped 6%, reaching a price of $1,128. This puts the company's market capitalization at $2.8 trillion, just $100 billion shy of Apple's $2.9 trillion value. Microsoft currently holds the title of the world's most valuable company, with a market value of $3.1 trillion. Apple follows at No. 2.The surge wasn't shy - Nvidia's stock briefly touched $1,149.39 during trading, another record. Meanwhile, Apple's stock dipped slightly.This rally comes after Nvidia impressed investors with a positive second-quarter revenue forecast and a stock split announcement. Analysts believe investors are excited about the company's potential in the booming AI market.""Nvidia's growth is simply outpacing expectations,"" said one analyst. ""Even with a high valuation, it doesn't seem like a bubble.""Nvidia's success is fueled by the demand for its high-performance chips, particularly in the data center segment where revenue has grown fivefold. Tech giants like Alphabet, Microsoft, and Amazon are all vying for these chips to power their AI initiatives.""Business is booming for Nvidia,"" said another analyst. ""AI is a hot topic, and investors are eager to be a part of it.""In contrast, Apple, traditionally a dominant tech player, has seen its stock underperform this year. This is likely due to weaker iPhone sales and competition in China. Unlike Microsoft, which capitalized on AI through its cloud services, Apple has been slower to adopt this technology.With Nvidia's impressive growth and Apple's recent struggles, the tech landscape may be on the cusp of a major shift.","N Nvidia's stock price surged on Tuesday (May 28), reaching a record high and pushing the company's market value closer to Apple.

Apple is expected to announce multiple AI features at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) 2024 conference scheduled to take place from June 10-14. Apple is speculated to unveil updates to its software platforms, including iOS 18 , iPadOS 18 , macOS 15 , visionOS 2 , and more. Apart from AI updates, the company will reportedly announce various features, including a ‘ Black Box ’ to protect user privacy.“When Apple executives appear at its developer conference in mid-June, they are expected to unveil details of how it will integrate AI in its Siri virtual assistant and other products. One of the big questions is how it will do so while still honouring its promises to protect the personal data of its users,” the report noted.Citing four former Apple employees, a report by The Information claims that the company will process AI applications in a virtual black box that will essentially make “it impossible for its employees to access” the user data.“Over the past three years, the company has been working on a secret project, known internally as Apple Chips in Data Centers or ACDC, that would allow for such black box processing. Its approach is similar in concept to confidential computing, an industry term that means the data is kept private even while it’s being processed,” the employees added.This year's WWDC is expected to be all about AI-related announcements. iOS 18 may get one of the biggest overhauls with AI-powered enhancements to Safari, Photos, Notes, and Siri.As per Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, Apple may release these highly-anticipated features with a “beta” or “preview” label.","Apple is expected to announce multiple AI features at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) 2024 conference scheduled to take place from June 10-14.

Google has unveiled a significant battery life improvement in the upcoming Android 15 update .

This update focuses on speeding up the activation of Doze mode.According to Google's internal testing, this translates to Android 15 devices entering Doze mode 50% faster compared to Android 14.The faster Doze mode activation has a direct impact on battery life. Google claims users can expect up to three additional hours of standby time on certain devices. This translates to a significant boost, especially for users who don't use their phones constantly but still experience battery drain throughout the day.The improved Doze mode is expected to be a general feature across all devices receiving the Android 15 update. While the exact improvement in standby time might vary depending on individual phone models and usage patterns, it signifies a positive step towards better battery management for the entire Android ecosystem.The focus on battery optimization extends beyond smartphones. Google hinted that the next iteration of their smartwatch platform, Wear OS 6, will also benefit from the faster Doze mode functionality.

Apple may bring iPhone 16 series in two new colours: Details,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/mobiles-tabs/apple-may-bring-iphone-16-series-in-two-new-colours-details/articleshow/110260524.cms,"

Pro models may get a new Rose colour

Apple

may rename existing colours

Apple iPhone 16 series launch is months away. But the rumour mill is buzzing with expected features, design and now colour of the 2024 iPhone lineup. Popular Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo says that the Cupertino-based company may add two new colours to the iPhone 16, replacing the existing ones.The information was shared by Kuo in a post on X, formerly Twitter .In the post, Kuo says that the Pro models - iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max could be offered in black, white or silver, gray or ""Natural Titanium,"" and an all-new rose. The existing iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max are offered in Black Titanium, White Titanium, Blue Titanium and Natural Titanium colours.Kuo reveals that the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus are expected to come in black, green, pink, blue and white colour variants. Apple may also rename previous colours as well, Kuo adds. For example, the existing white could be renamed to starlight. “Also, even if the colour name is the same as the existing model, it may look different”, he says.Earlier, Kuo said that the iPhone 16 Pro Max is expected to feature a new battery with better energy density, potentially enhancing battery life if Apple maintains the same battery size. According to Kuo, iPhone 16 Pro Max will reportedly see a substantial redesign of its battery, switching from an aluminium to a stainless steel casing. This shift not only increases the battery's energy density but also improves its structural integrity. While stainless steel is less effective at dissipating heat compared to aluminium, it offers stronger protection, which could be beneficial for the overall durability of the device.In a related news, display analyst Ross Young said that the display production for Apple iPhone 16 will begin next month. This is on schedule with the timing of last year’s iPhone 15 production and the 2024 iPhone series launch may follow the same timeline as last year.","Apple may add two new colours to the iPhone 16, replacing the existing ones.

In a bold move at the Cannes Film Festival, Polish director Patryk Vega unveiled his latest project, a biopic titled ""Putin,"" featuring an AI-generated deepfake of Russian President Vladimir Putin . The film, which has already been sold in 50 countries ahead of its September premiere, uses advanced artificial intelligence to replicate Putin's face on a real actor’s body.Vega, known for his popular Polish films, decided to use AI technology to create a more authentic portrayal of Putin.""To come extremely close to the dictator, we needed Putin, not an actor with make-up,"" Vega explained. The film’s trailer opens with a striking scene of the Russian leader cowering on the floor in diapers, setting the tone for its controversial narrative.As per an ET report, Vega humorously recounted his approach: ""I called Putin and asked him if he wanted to play in my movie... No, that was a joke."" Despite the jest, the director utilised AI to generate Putin's face due to the lack of sufficient high-resolution images for a full-body deepfake. The results, according to early viewers, are uncannily realistic.""Putin"" chronicles the life of the Russian president over six decades, starting from his childhood at age 10, where he is depicted being beaten by his stepfather. The film culminates in a fictional portrayal of his death, which Vega describes as ""a happy end.""The concept for the biopic emerged during the early days of Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Initially, Vega aimed to make a film about the Russian mafia but shifted focus to what he considered ""the biggest gangster.""Despite potential risks, Vega dismisses fears of reprisals, boldly stating, ""Putin should be afraid of me."" The director's venture into AI has broader implications for the film industry, particularly in Hollywood, where the technology is both a boon and a source of concern. AI advancements threaten traditional roles, especially among special effects technicians and extras, raising fears of job losses.These concerns were central to last year's strike by actors and writers, culminating in an agreement that included compensation for the use of AI-generated likenesses. Despite apprehensions, AI is already extensively used in the industry. For example, it was employed to de-age Harrison Ford in the latest ""Indiana Jones"" film, though studios often refrain from publicising these uses.Beyond film production, AI's applications are expanding in various sectors of the media. The Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media, for instance, uses algorithms to analyse screenplays for gender and diversity biases. YouTube, a significant player in film promotion and distribution, has leveraged AI for over a decade, employing it for automated subtitles and copyright protections.Since April, YouTube has begun labelling AI-generated content and enhancing its detection programs. Justine Ryst, head of YouTube France, emphasised that ""AI isn't going to take over creation. It's going to simplify the complex, and make possible the impossible."" She advocated for a balance between innovation and responsibility in utilising AI.","Polish director Patryk Vega unveiled his latest project, a biopic titled ""Putin,"" featuring an AI-generated deepfake of Russian President Vladimir Putin.

The big lesson learnt

Sam Altman , CEO of OpenAI , has been on a rollercoaster the last few years. Since the company's release of ChatGPT, he's widely regarded as the poster boy of Generative-AI world. He's met with world leaders, clashed with Elon Musk , and even joined the billionaire club. Amidst all this, he also got fired (briefly) from the company he co-founded.On a recent tech podcast ""The Logan Bartlett Show"", Altman said with a laugh that if he had more time to reflect, ""every day would have something crazy."" However, one truly surreal moment stands out: His four-day ousting from OpenAI.As reported by Business Insider, it wasn't the firing itself that was unreal. It was how he handled this bizarre situation. Altman described it as an ""insane, superjammed"" 4 ½ days where his body was in an ""adrenaline-charged state.""Within a day of being fired, world leaders started texting. He received messages from 10-20 presidents and prime ministers. He said it felt normal at the time, and he even thanked them without batting an eye.""It was just weird,"" Altman admitted. He barely slept or ate, but his focus and energy were off the charts.Once he got his job back, reality hit him. Stopping at a diner, he realized he hadn't eaten in days. Naturally, he celebrated with a feast: four ""heavy"" meals and two milkshakes (just for him!).The celebratory meal was great, but the real shocker came later. A president texted him, relieved things were settled.Suddenly, Altman realized how bizarre it all was. World leaders texting him during his firing shouldn't have felt normal, but it did. It showed him just how adaptable humans are.""We can get used to anything as the new normal, good or bad, pretty fast,"" Altman said. He sees this as a strength – humans can adapt to almost anything.""My takeaway is human adaptability to almost anything is just, like, much more remarkably strong than we realize,"" Altman said on the podcast. ""And you can get used to anything as the new normal, good or bad, pretty fast.""","Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, has been on a rollercoaster the last few years.
