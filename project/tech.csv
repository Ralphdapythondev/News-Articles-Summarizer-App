Star Health , the largest health insurer in the country, was hit with a data breach that exposed sensitive customer information, including medical records and tax details. According to a report by the news agency Reuters, the company has now revealed that the hacker responsible for the leak demanded a $68,000 (nearly 57.21 lakhs) ransom in August. The company noted that ""the threat actor demanded a ransom of $68,000 in an email"" addressed to its managing director and chief executive.The breach, which was first reported in September, has led to a reputational and business crisis for the company. Star Health’s shares have since declined by 11%. The company launched internal investigations and has also taken legal action against the messaging app Telegram and the hacker. The report claims that the hacker’s website continues to share samples of Star customers' data.This statement comes after stock exchanges asked Star Health for clarification over another Reuters report which claimed that the company was investigating allegations about its chief security officer being involved in the data leak.Later on, the company announced that it had found no wrongdoing by the official, Amarjeet Khanuja. However, the internal investigation stays open.The hacker exploited Telegram chatbots and a dedicated website to disseminate the stolen data and continues to share samples of customer information. In response to the breach, Star Health launched internal investigations and initiated legal action against Telegram and the hacker. The company is also collaborating with Indian cyber security authorities to address the situation.Despite receiving multiple notices from the insurance company, Telegram has refused to share information about the hacker's accounts or permanently ban them from the platform, Star Health said. The company also identified the hacker as ""xenZen"" in their latest statement.However, earlier, the Dubai-based messenger app said that it removed the chatbots as soon as it was flagged to the platform.","Star Health, India's largest health insurer, was hit with a data breach that exposed sensitive customer information, including medical records and tax details.

How this attack affected users



Users in multiple cities face similar issues



What the company said



Multiple Ecovacs Deebot X2 robot vacuums in US cities were recently hacked. This allowed attackers to remotely control the devices and broadcast racial slurs through their built-in speakers. This incident follows a report by the ABC, which demonstrated a critical security flaw in the Chinese-made robot vacuum model. The hackers exploited this vulnerability to gain unauthorised access to the Deebot X2s, enabling them to manipulate the vacuums' movements and utilise the speakers for malicious purposes.""It sounded like a broken-up radio signal or something. You could hear snippets of maybe a voice,” Minnesota lawyer Daniel Swenson said to ABC News. He said was watching TV when his robot vacuum started to malfunction.After resetting the device, the vacuum began moving on its own and broadcasting racist slurs through its speaker, exposing the family to hateful content. This incident highlights the serious privacy and security risks associated with smart home devices .""I got the impression it was a kid, maybe a teenager [speaking]. Maybe they were just jumping from device to device messing with families,” Swenson said.He also added that it could have been much worse as the attackers could’ve decided to quietly observe his family inside their home. The hackers could have easily spied on the family through the compromised robot vacuum, accessing its camera and microphone without their knowledge or consent. Finally, the device was taken to the garage and wasn’t switched on again.Multiple Ecovacs Deebot X2 robot vacuums in the US were reportedly hacked within days of each other. The attackers remotely controlled the vacuums, harassed pets, and yelled racist slurs through the speakers. These incidents follow an ABC News report that revealed security flaws in the Deebot X2, including a faulty PIN code system and the ability to disable the camera warning sound. Hackers could potentially access the camera and microphone without the owner's knowledge.Despite multiple reports of similar incidents, Ecovacs initially appeared dismissive of Daniel Swenson's complaint about his hacked robot vacuum. The company later conducted a ""security investigation"" and claimed that Swenson's account was likely compromised through a "" credential stuffing "" attack, where login credentials reused across multiple websites are stolen from a different platform. Ecovacs maintains that there is no evidence of a breach within their systems.","Multiple Ecovacs Deebot X2 robot vacuums in the US were reportedly hacked within days of each other.

What Elon Musk said about Ratan Tata in the video



“Take for a moment Ratan Tata, what he’s doing in India — developing a little sedan for $2300. Where do you put that in the whole equation of where the future of cars is?”

“I think it’s a good idea to have

affordable cars

, but I think the problem is with something like the Nano … I wouldn’t say it’s a problem because I think, by the way, it is probably a great idea and Ratan is a gentleman and scholar.”

“But where it’s going to become challenging in the future is when the price of gasoline rises; the cost of acquiring the car is much less of an issue than the cost of running the car,”

A video of Tesla CEO Elon Musk praising Ratan Tata 's vision for the Tata Nano has resurfaced and gone viral following the Indian industrialist 's passing. The clip from 20029, shared by X user Nico Garcia, features Musk in conversation with TV presenter Charlie Rose , discussing Tata's ambitious goal of creating an affordable car for the masses.Musk expresses admiration for Tata's pursuit of the Rs 1 lakh car, acknowledging the challenges and complexities involved in bringing such a project to fruition.The video has resonated with many as India mourns the loss of Ratan Tata, who transformed the Tata Group into a global powerhouse.While discussing the future of cars, Rose asked Musk:Replying to that, Musk said:Musk added.The video has already received over 3.3 lakh views and thousands of likes.

When Ratan Tata made this request to SEBI chief for TCS' first CEO FC Kohli during TCS IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/when-ratan-tata-made-this-request-to-sebi-chief-for-tcs-first-ceo-fc-kohli-during-tcs-ipo/articleshow/114173196.cms,"Sanghai on Ratan Tata's special request for TCS CEO to SEBI chief

July 2004, with torrential Bombay monsoon lashing outside, Mr. Ratan Tata got off the podium at the Ball room of Taj Mahal Hotel, Colaba. He had just announced the launch of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) Initial Public Offering (IPO), the most high-profile IPO of Indian capital markets then. There were quite a few capital market players and media people still waiting to interact with him. In this chaos he expressed his keenness to go meet the then SEBI Chairman, Mr. G N Bajpai. Almost at no notice, I, a young investment banker then, was handed the task of setting up this meeting at SEBI’s Nariman Point office.

I was clueless as to why Mr. Tata would want to rush to meet the SEBI chairman, and that too in such wet weather conditions. He had barely completed a very successful launch conference and there were people still wanting to meet him. But when we arrived at the SEBI headquarters, I was pleasantly surprised with the agenda of the meeting.

Mr. Tata started the meeting by saying, he requested for a short notice meeting for two reasons. First, he wanted to thank SEBI for their support through the IPO process. Second, and equally importantly, in his persuasive deep voice he said that Mr. F C Kohli, first CEO of TCS, had been instrumental in building an institution like TCS for the Tata Group. Mr. Tata therefore expressed his desire to allot one share to Mr.

F C Kohli

as a symbolic gesture in recognition of his contribution.

In another gesture of his humility, the bankers who accompanied Mr. Tata for the TCS IPO roadshow were very pleasantly surprised to receive a handwritten personal letter of appreciation from him. These small acts and values in totality are what made Mr. Tata the Redwood tree of the Indian corporate world – the tallest figure that leaves a mark that stays with you always.

Ratan Naval Tata passed away earlier this week at a hospital in Mumbai. Tata Group's chairman emeritus was India Inc's most-loved and respected leader. As several industry doyens said in their tribute to Ratan Tata , what he said was regarded as universal truth. Ratan Tata’s demise marks the end of an extraordinary corporate journey, one that not only made Tata Group a global giant but also set new benchmarks for Indian industry on the world map.Under his visionary leadership, Tata Group's revenue surged from $4 billion in 1991 to over $100 billion by 2012, when he retired, making it the first Indian business group to achieve this feat. One major milestone in this was the IPO of the group's software company -- Tata Consultancy Services -- in the year 2004. TCS made history with the first $1 billion initial public offering (IPO) by a private-sector company in India. TCS is Tata Group's most valuable and India's second-largest company in market cap.Ratan Tata led TCS' public listing. He even took part in some roadshows done for the TCS IPO. Writing for Economic Times, Sunil Sanghai, founder and CEO of NovaaOne Capital, shared an incident from the TCS IPO that showed how, as he wrote, ""the tallest member of the Indian industry (Ratan Tata) remembered every contribution and it was very important for him to recognise them.""",Ratan Naval Tata passed away earlier this week at a hospital in Mumbai.

What are the results of the study

LLMs ‘fall short of true logical reasoning’

Apple researchers , questioning the formal reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), particularly in mathematics, conducted a study to understand the reliability of the reported metrics. They found that LLMs exhibit noticeable variance when responding to different instantiations of the same question.Researchers were concerned whether LLMs mathematical reasoning capabilities have genuinely advanced, raising questions about the reliability of the reported metrics.To address these concerns, the researchers conducted a large-scale study on several state-of-the-art open and closed models.According to the results of the research, Apple researchers found that the reasoning process in LLMs is probabilistic pattern-matching rather than formal reasoning.“Our findings reveal that LLMs exhibit noticeable variance when responding to different instantiations of the same question,” the researchers wrote in their paper titled “GSM-Symbolic: Understanding the Limitations of Mathematical Reasoning in Large Language Models.”“Specifically, the performance of all models declines when only the numerical values in the question are altered in the GSM-Symbolic benchmark ,” they added.The ‘GSM8K’ benchmark is widely used to assess the mathematical reasoning of models on grade-school level questions.Although LLMs can match more abstract reasoning patterns, they fall short of true logical reasoning, the paper stated.“Additionally, in tasks requiring the correct selection of multiple tokens, the probability of arriving at an accurate answer decreases exponentially with the number of tokens or steps involved, underscoring their inherent unreliability in complex reasoning scenarios,” said Apple researchers.“Furthermore, we investigate the fragility of mathematical reasoning in these models and demonstrate that their performance significantly deteriorates as the number of clauses in a question increases. We hypothesise that this decline is due to the fact that current LLMs are not capable of genuine logical reasoning; instead, they attempt to replicate the reasoning steps observed in their training data,” they added.",Researchers were concerned whether LLMs mathematical reasoning capabilities have genuinely advanced. They conducted a large-scale study on several state-of-the- art open and closed models.

How does it work?

Phishing: Scammers often use phishing emails or calls to impersonate legitimate organizations like banks, e-commerce websites, or service providers.

Tricking the victim: They create a sense of urgency, claiming that there's a suspicious activity on their account or a need for immediate verification.

Requesting OTP: The victim is then asked to share their OTP, which the scammer uses to access their account and steal money or personal information .



How to Stay Safe from OTP Scams

Be cautious of unsolicited calls and emails: Never share personal information or OTPs with anyone who contacts you unexpectedly.

Verify the sender: Before clicking on any links or replying to emails, double-check the sender's address and look for any signs of phishing, such as poor grammar or unusual requests.

Never share OTPs: Remember that legitimate organizations will never ask you to share your OTP over the phone or email.

Use strong passwords: Create complex passwords for your online accounts and enable two-factor authentication whenever possible.

Report scams: If you believe you've been a victim of an OTP scam, report it to the relevant authorities and your bank or service provider immediately.



One of the most common and dangerous tactics used by scammers is the OTP ( One-Time Password ) scam. This type of fraud exploits the convenience of OTPs, which are designed to enhance security , but can also be a vulnerability if not handled carefully. In this explainer, we'll delve into the intricacies of OTP scams, how they work, and most importantly, how you can protect yourself from falling victim to these deceptive schemes.An OTP (One-Time Password) scam is a type of fraud where scammers trick victims into revealing their OTPs, which are typically used for verifying online transactions or account access.These codes are usually sent via SMS or email and are meant to be used only once.By following these tips, you can significantly reduce your risk of falling victim to an OTP scam.","An OTP (One-Time Password) scam is a type of fraud where scammers trick victims into revealing their OTPs.

Here’s what Anupam Mittal wrote in LinkedIn post

I had my first

panic attack

in 1998.

The U.S. economy crashed, the dot-com bubble burst, and I lost my job.

I was overwhelmed and anxious. It was terrifying.

I confided in a friend and his guidance became a lifeline, helping me slowly claw my way back to stability.

But when the financial crash hit again in 2008, the panic returned, and I found myself back in that dark place.

This time, however, I made a conscious choice to confront my anxiety disorder head-on. I sought professional help and began therapy.

Reflecting on my childhood, I also realize how little space there was for discussing feelings.

I don’t recall ever sitting with my parents to talk about > What troubled me at school? What makes me sad? What makes me happy?

But the times were different and they did the best they could. In fact, I owe most of my success to my mom & dad 🤗

But, now, as a father of a 6-yr-old, I want to break this cycle with Alyssa ❤️

I want her to grow up knowing that it’s okay to discuss our feelings, which we both do every night when I put her to bed.

But what I learnt is asking somebody about their emotional state simply does not work.

You have to first make yourself vulnerable and create a comfortable space for people to share their feelings, their fears & their vulnerabilities.

So, I did 2 things

1) Instead of asking Alyssa about her day (to which I never got any response 😅), I started telling her about mine. And voila, there it was!

2) We agreed to create a code-word for whenever we wished to discuss something serious or solve her problem. She named it Dolly-chat (idk why😂). We agreed that if either of us used that term, the other would drop everything and make themself available for a chat.

These 2 things have been transformational.

Of course, I also stay away from telling her what to do unless she asks. Instead I share my experiences from which she can draw.

So, as Alyssa might hear about “Mental Health Day” in school, I think she is going to feel pretty secure emotionally and confident that she is developing a healthy mind ❤️🙏

With the growing influence of generative AI , India's quick commerce platforms are increasingly incorporating AI technology to enhance customer experiences and improve personalization. By deploying AI-driven tools, platforms such as Zomato , Swiggy , and BlinkIt have streamlined product recommendations, optimised delivery routes, and introduced virtual assistants to simplify user interactions.These advancements improve operational efficiency and cater to individual preferences. However, the adoption of AI also presents significant challenges, including high implementation costs and concerns surrounding data privacy, which these platforms must navigate while expanding their technological capabilities.Zomato introduced a personalised AI food assistant, available initially for Zomato Gold members. The AI assistant provides tailored restaurant and dish recommendations based on user preferences. It can answer specific queries, such as ""What should I eat when I’m hungover?"" or suggest low-carb, high-protein meals. Zomato's AI stack is built on OpenAI’s large language models (LLMs) and is powered through Microsoft Azure. Additionally, Zomato uses AI on the backend to optimise delivery times and improve customer support.However, Zomato has taken a firm stance against AI-generated content for restaurants, banning the use of AI-generated images in menus and promotional materials. The company has developed tools to detect such content, warning restaurants of removal if they fail to comply.BlinkIt, Zomato’s quick commerce arm, rolled out an AI-driven feature called ""Recipe Rover"" in May 2023. This tool helps users discover recipes and simplifies meal planning by offering curated recipe suggestions based on special occasions, such as Ganesh Utsav. The recipes also provide macro-nutrient information, making meal planning more health-conscious. Powered by Midjourney and OpenAI’s GPT models, Recipe Rover helps users not only find recipes but also directly source the ingredients needed.Swiggy launched its own AI-powered recommendation tool, ‘What to Eat,’ which personalises food suggestions based on user mood, past orders, and trending dishes. The neural search engine developed by Swiggy offers users transparency, explaining why specific recommendations are made. Swiggy plans to enhance this feature with voice-based and multi-language support, making it accessible across various regions of India.Swiggy is also focusing on optimising its operations through AI, with AI-powered route optimization for delivery agents. The company plans to introduce an AI chatbot to assist users within Dineout, as well as an AI-powered bot for restaurant partners to address onboarding and other operational concerns.Myntra, a leading fashion e-commerce platform, launched MyFashionGPT in partnership with Microsoft. This AI assistant goes beyond conventional keyword searches, allowing users to ask open-ended queries like ""Show me clothes for a beach vacation"" and receiving suggestions spanning multiple categories. Myntra has also introduced Maya, an AI fashion influencer, to enhance customer engagement.Myntra continues to experiment with generative AI for customer support and creative automation. Upcoming AI capabilities include full outfit previews and enhanced voice search functionalities. Myntra ’s shift towards AI-driven personalization comes as the company pilots quick commerce services in select Indian cities, offering four-hour delivery windows.","India's quick commerce platforms are increasingly incorporating AI technology to enhance customer experiences and improve personalization.

Tensions rise between China and Taiwan



Four Taiwanese employees of Apple ’s key supplier Foxconn have been reportedly detained in China. A report by Taiwan ’s national news agency, the Central News Agency (CNA) cited the Taiwanese government to claim that these workers have been detained in Zhengzhou , the home of Foxconn’s largest iPhone factory, by the local public security bureau for the equivalent of “breach of trust” since January.However, the exact nature of the allegations couldn’t be determined.Taiwanese agencies responsible for managing relations with China said that these employees worked at a complex run by Taiwan’s Foxconn that makes products for Apple in Zhengzhou. The Zhengzhou facility plays a central role in Apple’s iPhone supply chain and has sometimes been called iPhone City.The Mainland Affairs Council, responsible for Taiwan's policy towards China, has described the allegations against the employees as “bizarre,” reports WSJ. Taiwanese authorities are calling for a swift and transparent investigation into the detention of four Foxconn employees in China, emphasizing that such incidents could undermine investor confidence in the country.Foxconn has reportedly stated that it did not suffer any financial losses related to the employees' actions. However, the detentions have raised concerns in Taiwan, prompting the council to urge China to ensure the safety and legal rights of Taiwanese citizens working in the country.This incident comes amidst heightened tensions between China and Taiwan and adds to growing concerns about the risks faced by foreign workers in China. In June, the Taiwanese government raised its travel alert level for China, advising citizens to avoid non-essential trips due to concerns overnational security laws and arbitrary detentions.China recently introduced rules targeting pro-Taiwan independence figures, with threats including the death penalty, which has raised concerns for Taiwanese nationals working in China. Taiwanese authorities, through the Straits Exchange Foundation, are assisting Foxconn and the families of detained individuals.The incident follows Foxconn's earlier investigation by Chinese tax and land authorities in 2023, coinciding with the company's founder, Terry Gou's, brief run for Taiwan's presidency. Foreign businesses operating in China, such as Foxconn, have been uneasy due to detentions, including those of a Japanese executive and an Australian journalist.Meanwhile, despite these tensions, Chinese officials continue to express the desire to attract foreign investment. The Shanghai city government recently highlighted challenges stemming from Apple's decision to diversify production away from China to other countries like India and Vietnam.","Four Taiwanese employees of Apple's key supplier Foxconn have been reportedly detained in China.

Zerodha co-founder and CEO Nithin Kamath , his brother and Zerodha co-founder Nikhil Kamath and CTO Kailash Nadh were recently at the company's Bangalore office for a podcast. Speaking at the special for CNBC-TV18’s Young Turks Reloaded podcast, the trio discussed the challenges they face as their company continues to grow.Nikhil Kamath highlighted the fear and uncertainty that pervades the startup ecosystem, emphasizing the need for a more collaborative approach between entrepreneurs, regulators, and the government.He argued that excessive regulations can stifle innovation and discourage entrepreneurship. “We are subject to regulators who we don't really have any influence [with] or access to their decisions, who can reduce our revenues by 50% in one day. They can make us shut down,” he said.However, Kamath is quick to add that Indian regulators have made the system more robust. But them he said that excessive regulations too can be bad. “In a classroom with 50 kids, where the teacher makes the rules and reprimands kids at will, will there be innovation coming out of those kids who are living in fear? Likely not,” he says.Nithin Kamath echoed these sentiments, noting that Zerodha's recent revenue growth is likely to slow down due to new regulations imposed by the Securities & Exchange Board of India (SEBI). He cited the true-to-label circular as one example of a regulation that will negatively impact the company's bottom line. “Running a broking firm is a tough job,” Nithin Kamath said.Despite the challenges, the Zerodha founders remain optimistic about the future of the Indian startup ecosystem. They believe that by fostering a more collaborative and supportive environment, India can achieve significant growth and innovation.His wry comment follows on the heels of Nikhil’s much more alarming declaration, “I feel like there's a lot of fear, not just here but everywhere in the ecosystem.
