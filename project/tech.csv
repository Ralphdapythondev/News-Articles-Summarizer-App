Google I/O 2024: Android is getting features to protect phones when they are stolen,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-i/o-2024-android-is-getting-features-to-protect-phones-when-they-are-stolen/articleshow/110157237.cms,"Improved device and data protection to deter theft before it happens

Security features to strengthen Android device's security against theft:

Factory reset upgrade prevents a reset by a thief:

Private space to hide sensitive apps:

More steps for changing sensitive device settings:

Enhanced authentication in case the PIN is known by a thief:

Automatic protection when the phone is stolen

Automatic AI-powered screen lock:

Offline Device Lock for added protection:

Automatic locking of Android device after they are stolen

With Remote Lock feature

Google I/O 2024 , the company’s annual developers conference, is underway. On the second day of the event, Google announced several features for Android smartphones, including a new suite of advanced theft protection features that it claims will protect users’ data before, during and after their phone is stolen.Google is bringing a bunch of new features and enhancing some older ones to strengthen an Android device's security against theft.It says that the new and improved protection features “will make thieves think twice about trying.”Usually, when a phone is stolen, thieves quickly reset the device and resell it. Android phones will now be difficult to factory reset with an upgrade to Android’s factory reset protection. If your phone is stolen, thieves won’t be able to factory reset it as it will require device or Google account credentials – rendering the stolen device unsellable.In case a thief gets access to your phone, they may want to extract valuable data and transfer funds from your phone that can be worth much more than the phone itself. Android will now have a ‘Private’ space – a separate area in the phone that can hide and lock with a separate PIN, giving users additional security for apps that may contain sensitive data, like health or financial information.Android phones will now require PIN, password or biometric authentication to disable Find My Device or extend screen timeout, essentially adding an extra layer of security.When enabled, the new enhanced authentication will require biometrics for accessing and changing critical Google account and device settings, like changing your PIN, disabling theft protection or accessing Passkeys, from an untrusted location.Factory reset protection updates and private space will be released as part of Android 15 while enhanced authentication protections will be released to select devices later this year.In case your phone is stolen, Android will soon automatically recognise suspicious signals and proactively protect the data on the device.When your Android phone is snatched, the Theft Detection Lock feature will use Google AI to sense it by detecting common motion associated with theft and quickly locks the screen.If a thief tries to disconnect a stolen Android phone for prolonged periods of time, Offline Device Lock automatically locks the screen to help protect your data even when the device is off the grid. It will also lock the device screen when excessive failed authentication attempts are made.Theft Detection Lock and Offline Device Lock will be available to Android 10+ devices through a Google Play services update later this year.Third is an upgrade to the Find My Device feature that allows users to remotely lock or wipe a lost or stolen phone and mark it as lost for easier tracking., users will be able to lock the screen of their phones with just their phone numbers and a quick security challenge using any device, essentially buying you the time to recover account details and perform full factory reset.","Google I/O 2024, the company’s annual developers conference, is underway.

The number of times Google said “AI” during the presentation

Google's annual developer conference, Google I/O, kicked off today with a keynote address by CEO Sundar Pichai . As expected, AI was a prominent theme, with Pichai highlighting significant advancements in Google's Gemini AI models and the company's growing prowess in the field. Here's a deeper dive into some of the key numbers Pichai shared:Google introduced Gemini 1.5 Pro earlier this year allowing AI models to handle long context.It can run 1 million tokens in production, which it claims is more than any other large-scale foundation model yet.Pichai said that more than 1.5 million developers use Gemini models across the company's tools. He said that Gemini 1.5 Pro is available to all developers globally across 35 languages.“All of our 2-billion user products use Gemini,” Pichai said, adding that over 1 million people have signed up to try Gemini AI in just three months.While talking about Google Photos, Pichai said that the app – which was launched almost nine years ago – sees more than 6 billion photos and videos being uploaded every single day.While discussing multimodality in AI models, Pichai said that Gemini AI models have taken a step further in terms long context, enabling us to bring in even more information: hundreds of pages of text, hours of audio or an hour of video, entire code repos…or, if you want, roughly 96 Cheesecake Factory menus.The top executive announced the company’s 6th generation of TPUs, called Trillium. Trillium is said to be Google’s most performant and most efficient TPU to date, delivering a 4.7x improvement in compute performance per chip over the previous generation, TPU v5e.Pichai said that Google’s total deployed fleet capacity for liquid cooling systems is nearly 1 gigawatt and growing — that’s close to 70 times the capacity of any other fleet.“Underlying this is the sheer scale of our network, which connects our infrastructure globally. Our network spans more than 2 million miles of terrestrial and subsea fiber: over 10 times (!) the reach of the next leading cloud provider,” he added.Among various other jokes, there was a tongue in cheek moment on stage where Google seemed to take a dig at last year’s reports where publications counted how many times did Google executives use the word “AI” over the course of the presentation.Pichai said that Gemini has done the heavy lifting and counted it. All Google executives used “AI” terms over 120 times during the 110-minute presentation.","Google's annual developer conference, Google I/O, kicked off today.

Consumer complaints related to e-commerce surged from 95,270 in 2018 to a staggering 4,44,034 in 2023, highlighting the urgency of stricter regulations.The proposed Quality Control Order will enforce the existing IS 19000:2022 standard, which outlines guidelines for both reviewers and platforms. This standard aims to ensure transparency and prevent manipulation by requiring:* Identification of Reviewers: Anonymity for reviewers will be eliminated.* Unedited Reviews: Reviews cannot be altered after submission to prevent tampering with content.* Encouraging All Reviews: Platforms cannot suppress negative reviews.Consumer Affairs Secretary Nidhi Khare emphasized the importance of these standards, stating that online shoppers rely heavily on reviews, especially for products they cannot examine physically. Fake reviews erode trust in online platforms and lead to poor purchasing decisions. While consumer activist Pushpa Girimji, who attended the meeting, welcomed the initiative, she stressed the importance of enforcing these regulations effectively to truly combat the issue of fake reviews.The draft Quality Control Order will be open for public consultation before implementation.

Music Haptics and Vocal Shortcuts enhance accessibility

AI-powered features reduce motion sickness and improve Speech Recognition

visionOS and CarPlay receive accessibility upgrades

Apple has announced a bunch of new accessibility features for iPhone , iPad , and Vision Pro , which should help users with disabilities interact with their devices better. The new features, including Eye Tracking and Music Haptics , are expected to debut in iOS 18 and VisionOS later this year, harnessing the power of artificial intelligence and machine learning to create a more inclusive user experience.The standout feature is Eye Tracking, which enables users with physical disabilities to navigate their iPhone or iPad using only their eyes. By using the front-facing camera and on-device machine learning, Eye Tracking allows users to select elements on the screen by simply holding their gaze, eliminating the need for touch input. It uses AI to recognize user gestures like swiping and tapping. Apple's Dwell Control feature is already available on Macs, sensing when someone's gaze pauses on an element. The setup process is quick, and it works with third-party apps integrated into the OS, like Assistive Touch.Apple also introduced Music Haptics, a feature designed for users who are deaf or hard of hearing. Using the iPhone's Taptic Engine, Music Haptics translates millions of songs on Apple Music into taps, textures, and vibrations, providing a new way to experience music. Additionally, Vocal Shortcuts allows users to assign custom phrases to launch shortcuts and perform complex tasks hands-free.Vehicle Motion Cues, another notable addition, aims to reduce motion sickness for passengers using their iPhone or iPad in a moving vehicle. By displaying animated dots on the screen's edges that mimic the vehicle's motion, the feature minimises sensory conflict. Furthermore, Listen for Atypical Speech uses machine learning to recognize unique speech patterns, benefiting users with conditions like cerebral palsy, ALS, or stroke.Apple's upcoming visionOS platform will include systemwide Live Captions, aiding users who are deaf or hard of hearing in following along with spoken dialogue. CarPlay will also gain accessibility features like Voice Control, Color Filters, and Sound Recognition, making it easier for users with disabilities to navigate and control apps while driving.","Apple announces new accessibility features for iPhone, iPad, and Vision Pro.

Google I/O 2024: When Google’s Gemini got the camera tips wrong on stage,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-i/o-2024-when-googles-gemini-got-the-camera-tips-wrong-on-stage/articleshow/110156396.cms,"Search in the Gemini era | Google I/O 2024

Google is changing internet search as we know it, infusing it with AI and serving up all the information you need on top of the page so you don't have to scroll through the whole internet. Gone are the days when you'd have to type out what you wanted to know or even put a photo. Now, you can just show AI the things you need help with, and it'll have the answer for you.But what if it's not working as it should be, meaning giving the wrong answers, so bad that even a human knows, but AI doesn't?In a video showing "" Search in the Gemini era ,"" Google showed its hot new feature, the video search. What does it do? Video search allows you to search by talking over a video clip.The example they used was a video of a film camera where the lever to advance the film was stuck. They asked Gemini: ""Why is the lever not moving all the way."" Gemini quickly listed solutions, including one that wasn’t right and would ruin the photos for sure.Google’s AI told the person to ""Open the back door and gently remove the film if the camera is jammed."" Doing that to a film camera would ruin all the photos by exposing the film to light.So far, Google has provided no comment on this matter.This isn’t the first time Google has run into issues with its AI on stage. Last year, at I/O, when it was showcasing the Bard (the former name of Gemini), the AI chatbot wrongly claimed that the James Webb Space Telescope took the first pictures of exoplanets when it was the European Very Large Telescope in 2004. This error cost Google about $100 billion, wiping out a huge chunk of its market valuation.Leave the text, but Google’s image AI isn’t that perfect, either. Earlier this year, Gemini also faced criticism for refusing to generate images of white people and producing historically inaccurate content like ""Asian Nazis."" Google apologised for this and had to pause the image-generating capabilities for a few weeks.","Video search allows you to search by talking over a video clip.

Google accidentally 'deletes' $125 billion account holding pension funds from Cloud; CEO says sorry,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-accidentally-deletes-125-billion-account-holding-pension-funds-from-cloud-ceo-says-sorry/articleshow/110135841.cms,"Here's the joint statement:

UniSuper and Google Cloud understand the disruption to services experienced by members has been extremely frustrating and disappointing. We extend our sincere apologies to all members.

While supporting UniSuper to bring its systems back online, Google Cloud has been conducting a root cause analysis.

Google Cloud CEO, Thomas Kurian has confirmed that the disruption arose from an unprecedented sequence of events whereby an inadvertent misconfiguration during provisioning of UniSuper’s Private Cloud services ultimately resulted in the deletion of UniSuper’s Private Cloud subscription.

This is an isolated, ‘one-of-a-kind occurrence’ that has never before occurred with any of Google Cloud’s clients globally. This should not have happened. Google Cloud has identified the events that led to this disruption and taken measures to ensure this does not happen again.

Why did the outage last so long?

UniSuper had duplication in two geographies as a protection against outages and loss. However, when the deletion of UniSuper’s Private Cloud subscription occurred, it caused deletion across both of these geographies.

Restoring UniSuper’s Private Cloud instance has called for an incredible amount of focus, effort, and partnership between our teams to enable an extensive recovery of all the core systems. The dedication and collaboration between UniSuper and Google Cloud has led to an extensive recovery of our Private Cloud which includes hundreds of virtual machines, databases and applications.

UniSuper had backups in place with an additional service provider. These backups have minimised data loss, and significantly improved the ability of UniSuper and Google Cloud to complete the restoration.

What’s next?

UniSuper and Google Cloud have been working around the clock on a resolution. The completion of the restoration swiftly, safely and securely remains Google Cloud and UniSuper’s top priority.

Australian pension fund UniSuper members faced a week-long outage due to an accidental deletion of their private cloud account by Google Cloud . This impacted over half a million people who couldn't access their superannuation accounts.Service restoration began on Thursday, but it might take some time for investment balances to reflect current figures.UniSuper assured members they're working on a swift update.UniSuper CEO, Peter Chun, reached out to members via email on Wednesday. He clarified that the incident wasn't a cyberattack and there was no data breach. Chun pinpointed a Google Cloud configuration error as the culprit behind the outage.The outage reportedly lasted for an extended period of time as the subscription was deleted, taking with it UniSuper's two geographies that were intended to provide protection against outages and loss. Fortunately, UniSuper had backups in place with a different service provider. UniSuper is said to have moved a large amount of its workloads to Google Cloud Platform in 2023, having previously split them between Azure and two of its own data centers.In a rare move, UniSuper and Google Cloud issued a joint apology. In a joint statement with UniSuper CEO Peter Chun , Google CEO Thomas Kurian admitted that an ""inadvertent misconfiguration"" during the provisioning of UniSuper's Private Cloud services resulted in the deletion of the data.","Australian pension fund UniSuper members faced a week-long outage due to an accidental deletion of their private cloud account by Google Cloud.

Google's annual developer conference, Google I/O 2024 , will kick off on May 14 with a keynote address that promises to showcase the tech giant's latest advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), Android updates, and some new hardware.Building upon last year's AI-centric event, Google is expected to double down on its AI initiatives, focusing strongly on its Gemini platform.Gemini, Google's answer to OpenAI's ChatGPT , will likely take centre stage as the company demonstrates new features and capabilities that could further enhance the AI chatbot we know today.While AI steals the spotlight, Google won't forget its roots in mobile technology. Attendees can expect a deep dive into Android 15, the latest version of Google's mobile operating system. With the first Android 15 beta already in the hands of developers, Google is poised to unveil a host of new user-facing features designed to enhance productivity, privacy, and security. Android 15 promises to deliver a more polished and efficient mobile experience, from improved notification management to a more refined user interface.Although Google I/O is primarily a software-focused event, the company has been known to surprise audiences with hardware announcements in the past. This year, the Pixel 8a has already been unveiled ahead of the conference, but that doesn't mean Google is out of tricks. Whispers of a potential Pixel Fold 2 or even a teaser for the upcoming Pixel 9 series have been circulating, leaving tech enthusiasts eager to see what Google has up its sleeve.We might also see some new Nest hardware make it to the main stage. A new chromecast, possibly a ‘Pro’ one.In addition to the headline-grabbing announcements, Google I/O 2024 is expected to showcase updates and improvements across the company's vast ecosystem of products and services. From enhancements to Google Maps and Google Workspace to advancements in WearOS and smart home technology - we could hear about the new upgrades coming to them. But, at the end of the day, it’s going to be all about AI.The keynote is what most normal people focus on, but the I/O is a developer galore. Developers can look forward to a wealth of sessions, workshops, and resources designed to help them leverage the latest technologies and best practices in their projects. Whether it's harnessing the power of AI, optimising for Android 15, or integrating with Google's ever-expanding suite of tools, developers are in for new technologies to play with.With AI poised to take centre stage and Android 15 promising a new era of mobile innovation, Google seems ready to set the tone for the coming year at the I/O 2024.","Google's annual developer conference, Google I/O 2024, will kick off on May 14.

Buying a second-hand phone? Key factors to keep in mind before making a purchase,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-tips/buying-a-second-hand-phone-key-factors-to-keep-in-mind-before-making-a-purchase/articleshow/110144525.cms,"Buy second-hand phone: Key factors to consider before purchasing

Phone condition: Assess the physical condition of the phone. Look for scratches, dents, or other signs of wear. Check the screen for cracks and ensure all buttons and ports function correctly.

Age of the phone: Determine how old the phone is and consider its release date. Older models may lack software updates and compatibility with newer apps.

Battery health: Battery life is crucial for a smooth user experience. Inquire about the battery health and ask for details on its capacity and degradation over time.

Software updates: Ensure the phone is compatible with the latest software updates from the manufacturer. Older devices may not receive updates, which can impact security and functionality.

Network compatibility: Confirm that the phone is unlocked or compatible with your network carrier. Some phones are locked to specific carriers, limiting your options.

IMEI check: Verify the phone's IMEI number to ensure it's not stolen or blacklisted. This step helps prevent buying a phone with legal issues or unpaid bills.

Performance testing: Test the phone's performance by running apps, browsing the internet, and checking the camera quality. Look for lagging or freezing issues.

Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max: 4 new camera features Apple may add to iPhone 16 Pro models,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/mobiles-tabs/4-new-camera-features-apple-may-add-to-iphone-16-pro-models/articleshow/110057298.cms,"Upgraded ultra-wide cameras



Tetra-prism lens for iPhone 16 Pro



Improved lens flare control



New Sony primary sensor for improved low-light photography



Apple is expected to launch the iPhone 16 series later this year in September. The upcoming lineup may include four smartphone models -- the iPhone 16, the iPhone 16 Plus, the iPhone 16 Pro and the iPhone 16 Pro Max. The Pro variants in the upcoming iPhone lineup are rumoured to bring new features like larger displays, a dedicated Capture button and more.According to a recent report by 9to5Mac, the Cupertino-based tech giant is also expected to add multiple noticeable improvements to the camera hardware of the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max models. Here are four new camera upgrades that may arrive with iPhone 16 Pro smartphones:Rumours suggest the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max may get an upgraded 48MP Ultra Wide camera this year. This is expected to be a major improvement from the current 12 MP Ultra Wide camera in the iPhone 15 Pro models.This upgrade is expected to offer improved performance in various shooting scenarios, particularly in low-light conditions. Images captured with the new Ultra-Wide camera are likely to show greater details and enhanced colour accuracy. The higher resolution will also provide increased flexibility during editing and post-processing.Furthermore, the 48MP Ultra Wide camera in the iPhone 16 Pro may also lead to significant advancements in spatial video recording. This feature, which utilises both the Main and Ultra Wide lenses, may enable the iPhone 16 Pro to record spatial video in 4K resolution. To compare, the iPhone 15 Pro is limited to recording spatial video at 1080p resolution.The current iPhone 15 Pro Max features a new tetra-prism camera design which offers 5x optical zoom and 25x digital zoom capabilities. With the upcoming iPhone 16 lineup, Apple is reportedly planning to extend this upgraded tetra-prism camera to the smaller iPhone 16 Pro model as well. This means both the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max will offer at least 5x optical zoom and 25x digital zoom.Rumours also suggest that the iPhone 16 Pro Max might feature a “periscope ultra-long telephoto combination.” This technology could potentially enable optical zoom greater than 5x.A common issue faced by most iPhone users is capturing lens flare while shooting in bright lighting conditions. This results in unexpected artefacts and internal reflections showing on images. While this problem is prevalent across most cameras on the market, Apple is reportedly working on a solution for the iPhone 16 Pro.According to rumours, Apple is testing a new ""atomic layer deposition"" (ALD) lens coating technology for the iPhone 16 Pro models. This anti-reflective coating could be applied to the iPhone 16 Pro's camera lenses to reduce the impact of internal reflections.If this rumour is true, users can expect fewer unexpected artefacts in images captured with the iPhone 16 Pro, particularly in bright lighting scenarios.The iPhone 16 Pro is expected to feature a new main camera sensor from Sony, which is designed to improve low-light performance.As per the report, Sony's latest stacked sensor technology separates the photodiodes and pixel transistors (which are usually combined into a single layer). This separation will allow the photodiodes responsible for capturing light to be significantly larger within the same overall pixel size.Sony claims that this new sensor will capture twice as much light as existing camera sensors. The increased light capture and reduced noise are expected to offer improved photos for iPhone users in all conditions.However, it remains uncertain whether this next-generation Sony sensor will be utilised in both iPhone 16 Pro models. A tipster on the Chinese social media platform Weibo suggested that only the iPhone 16 Pro Max may feature this upgraded stacked camera sensor hardware.","Apple is expected to launch the iPhone 16 series later this year in September.

How were they caught



US-based multinational shipping and courier service, United Parcel Service ( UPS ) has reportedly used fake iPhones , AirPods, and other Apple products to seize its employees who were allegedly stealing from customers instead of delivering their goods. According to the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office (PBSO), four men who were involved in this alleged courier stealing were caught by the police and they are part of a larger criminal conspiracy, reports Bocanewsnow.The defendants, Joseph Nunnally, Payton Brooker and Christopher Ventress have been charged with an organised scheme to defraud.Meanwhile, the fourth defendant, Fouad Saleh has been charged with grand theft, obtaining property by fraud, tampering with physical evidence, and dealing in stolen property. All four arrested UPS employees live in Palm Beach County Florida, US.As per multiple arrest reports filed by PBSO detectives, these men were involved in a scheme to intercept roughly $52,000 worth of iPhones and other Apple products in South Florida.The men allegedly created “ghost labels” while in a UPS facility in Palm Beach County that used addresses flagged by a UPS security system.UPS’ loss prevention system notified the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office which then intercepted the already stolen phones. Detectives placed trackers in the boxes which included several fake phones and then watched as the phones (along with the trackers) were delivered to an address in West Palm Beach.The people at the address then took the phones to Boost Mobile. It was unclear whether they then attempted to sell the phones to the retail store or have the phones activated to resell. While they were in Boost Mobile with the tracked phones, PBSO detectives moved in and took everyone into custody.","UPS allegedly used fake iPhones, AirPods, and other Apple products to seize its employees who were allegedly stealing from customers.

The label uses stars to indicate the efficiency of a product, with more stars indicating higher efficiency. Simply put, the higher the energy efficiency rating of the appliance, the lower its energy consumption. To effectively reduce your home's energy costs, opt for appliances with a 5-star BEE rating.
