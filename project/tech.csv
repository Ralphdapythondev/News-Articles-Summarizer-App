How Google is using its latest Gemini AI model to train robots “navigate the world”,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-google-is-using-its-latest-gemini-ai-model-to-train-robots-navigate-the-world/articleshow/111668165.cms,"How Google trained a robot on Gemini 1.5 AI model

Google , at I/O 2024, showcased multimodal capabilities in the Gemini 1.5 AI model. This means that the large language model can take photos, videos and audio, along with text, as inputs, process that information and generate responses. The company’s AI unit is now leveraging this capability to train robots to navigate their surroundings.Google Deepmind recently published a research paper, and a bunch of clips detailing how a robot can be trained and can understand multimodal instructions, including natural language and image, and perform useful navigation.“To achieve this, we study a widely useful category of navigation tasks we call Multimodal Instruction Navigation with demonstration Tours (MINT), in which the environment prior is provided through a previously recorded demonstration video,” Google said, adding that the advances in Vision Language Models (VLMs) have shown a promising path in achieving this goal.In a threat shared on X (formerly Twitter), Google noted that since a limited context length makes it a challenge for many AI models to recall environments, Gemini’s 1.5 Pro’s 1 million token context length helped the company to train robots for navigation.Robots “can use human instructions, video tours, and common sense reasoning to successfully find their way around a space,” it said.The trainers took the robots on a tour of specific areas in a real-world setting, and in the process highlighted key places to recall. Then, they were asked to lead us to these locations.For example, in an office setting, a robot can be trained to be a guide. It can be made to learn the location of the company’s Chairman’s office, canteen area or play area, and so on. When guests come to meet a company executive, they can ask the robot to “take me to the Chairman’s office” and it will oblige. Similarly, new joinees may ask the robot to take them to the canteen, and it can guide the employee to the location.“The system’s architecture takes in these inputs and then creates a topological graph - or a simplified representation of a space. This is constructed from frames within tour videos, which captures the general connectivity of their surroundings to find a path without a map,” Google Deepmind said.As per Google, the company evaluated the output in an office and a home-like environment, and achieved 86% and 90% success rates, respectively.“In the future, users could simply record a tour of their environment with a smartphone for their personal robot assistant to understand and navigate,” the company added.","Google showcased multimodal capabilities in the Gemini 1.5 AI model.

Why Amazon and Google are upset with Microsoft winning $22 million cloud deal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-amazon-and-google-are-upset-with-microsoft-winning-22-million-cloud-deal/articleshow/111669104.cms,"The agreement includes two key points:

What makes Google and Amazon upset

Microsoft has reached a deal with a cloud services organization (CISPE) to resolve an antitrust complaint over licensing practices. This agreement avoids a potential European Union investigation and hefty fine.CISPE, representing companies like Amazon and smaller European cloud providers, filed the complaint in late 2022 to the European Commission. They argued that Microsoft's licensing terms, implemented in October that year, were harming the European cloud computing market.While Microsoft isn't the industry leader (Amazon holds that title), it's a major player alongside Google .Cloud computing has attracted antitrust scrutiny worldwide.""We've addressed past concerns and created a path for more competition,"" said Microsoft President Brad Smith, highlighting collaboration with CISPE.Microsoft will develop a product allowing CISPE members to run Microsoft software on their platforms within Microsoft's Azure cloud infrastructure, at prices matching Microsoft's own.Microsoft will compensate CISPE members for licensing-related revenue losses over the past two years (specific amount undisclosed).The deal reportedly totals around 20 million euros, but excludes major players like Amazon Web Services (AWS ) and Google Cloud Platform. This has drawn criticism from both the companies.AWS remains committed to fighting for fair practices for all customers, while Google Cloud hopes regulators elsewhere will examine Microsoft's licensing. CISPE, satisfied with the agreement, will withdraw its complaint and refrain from future complaints on these issues.In a statement to The Verge, Amazon spokesperson Alia Ilyas said that Microsoft was only making “limited concessions for some CISPE members that demonstrate there are no technical barriers preventing it from doing what’s right for every cloud customer.”","CISPE, representing companies like Amazon and smaller European cloud providers, filed the complaint in late 2022 to the European Commission.

"US IT company Intuit to layoff 1,800: CEO writes open letter to employees, says jobs cuts not to reduce costs",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/us-it-company-intuit-to-layoff-1800-ceo-writes-open-letter-to-employees-says-not-cutting-jobs-to-reduce-costs/articleshow/111668993.cms,"Hi team,

As I’ve shared many times, the era of AI is one of the most significant technology shifts of our lifetime. This is truly an extraordinary time – AI is igniting global innovation at an incredible pace, transforming every industry and company in ways that were unimaginable just a few years ago. Companies that aren’t prepared to take advantage of this AI revolution will fall behind and, over time, will no longer exist.

Intuit is at a critical moment in our history. For over 40 years, we’ve had a successful track record of self-disruption and reinvention, transforming through multiple technological shifts. We were early to bet on and invest in AI, building one of the largest AI-driven expert platforms to fuel the success of consumers, small and mid-market businesses, and important partners like accountants, financial institutions, and marketing agencies who rely on us daily to prosper. With the introduction of GenAI, we are now delivering even more compelling customer experiences, increasing monetization potential, and driving efficiencies in how the work gets done within Intuit. But it’s just the beginning of the AI revolution.

Intuit is in a position of strength; we have the strategy and momentum that we need to succeed. To fulfill our mission to power the prosperity of our customers around the world and strengthen our leadership position, we must accelerate our innovation and investments in the areas that are most important to our future success. With this context, I am sharing some very difficult decisions my leadership team and I have made to ensure we are able to increase investment in these key growth areas. Today we will be communicating to approximately 1,800 employees, which is 10% of our workforce, that they will be leaving Intuit. These are extremely painful decisions for me and my team because we deeply understand the impact these decisions have on our friends and colleagues who will be leaving. We are very grateful for the great work they have done and the amazing contributions they have made while at Intuit.

We do not do layoffs to cut costs, and that remains true in this case. The changes we are making today enable us to allocate additional investments to our most critical areas to support our customers and drive growth as detailed below. This includes reinvesting in the necessary skills and capabilities to support these areas, and, as such, we will hire approximately 1,800 new people primarily in engineering, product, and customer facing roles such as sales, customer success, and marketing. In context of the actions we are taking today, we expect our overall headcount to grow in FY25 and beyond.

Accelerating investments in the areas that matter most

We will accelerate our investments and hiring in the following areas to support growth, aligned to our company strategy and Big Bets:

Revolutionize Speed to Benefit (Big Bet 1): Our GenAI-powered financial assistant, Intuit Assist, coupled with our network of experts, allows us to deliver delightful “done-for-you” experiences with a gateway to human expertise. To deliver these capabilities, we will accelerate investing in data and AI, leveraging GenOS to reimagine our products from traditional workflows to AI-native experiences that eliminate work, save time, and put more money in our customers’ pockets. We are accelerating our hiring of top engineering talent across the technology ecosystem to support these investments.

Connecting People to Experts (Big Bet 2): Our AI-driven expert platform is a game-changer for Intuit. No other company can deliver a digital platform with embedded AI-powered human expertise at our scale to serve the financial needs of consumers, small and mid-market businesses, and partners. We are increasing investments in data and AI to more effectively leverage accurate and complete data to do the work for our customers and match customers to the “right” experts in real-time to provide the specific, personalized assistance to fuel their success. To advance this area, we are hiring additional talent to bolster our expert network teams that are augmented by AI to assist our customers and we are investing in hiring marketing talent with deep expertise in digital services.

Accelerating Money Solutions: We’ve successfully built a fintech platform that enables our customers to manage their money end-to-end and to improve cash flow. This is an important driver to improving the success rate of our small and mid-market customers. We are accelerating our investment to deliver best-in-class, seamless payments, capital, banking, bill pay, and invoicing solutions across several geographies. We are hiring additional experienced fintech talent in engineering, design, risk, and customer success.

Disrupting the Mid-Market (Big Bet 5): We continue to have a massive opportunity to fuel mid-market customers’ success with our offerings, building a significant growth engine for Intuit. Our vision is to be an AI-driven expert platform for mid-market customers, delivering industry-specific experiences to fuel their success as the complexity of their business grows. We are accelerating investments to serve these customers on our platform, such as more sophisticated accounting and reporting capabilities, money solutions, human capital management, and customer acquisition solutions with Mailchimp, all assisted by AI-powered human experts. To achieve this goal, we are accelerating hiring talent with deep mid-market customer experience in product, account management, marketing, sales, and customer success.

Accelerating International Growth: International continues to be a significant opportunity for us. Bringing QuickBooks and Mailchimp together to create one growth platform around the world, where we have product market fit, including in Canada, UK, and Australia, is important to driving our success. We are investing in expanding our AI-driven expert platform in these markets and leveraging Mailchimp’s international footprint to lead our expansion in Europe and “rest of world.” This investment will enable us to offer a greater set of our ecosystem of services to customers in international markets, and we remain committed to our international hubs in London, Toronto, and Sydney. We are hiring talent with international experience, including in product, engineering, and go-to-market skills to accelerate our progress in this area.

Taking care of our people

It is never easy to say goodbye to our colleagues and friends and we are committed to treating everyone who has been impacted by these changes with the compassion and respect they deserve.

Let me first start with who is impacted by these decisions:

We’ve significantly raised the bar on our expectations of employee performance, resulting in approximately 1,050 employees leaving the company who are not meeting expectations and who we believe will be more successful outside of Intuit.

To continue increasing our velocity of decision making and empowering our employees to deliver for our customers, we are reducing the number of executives (director and above) by approximately 10%, expanding certain executive roles and responsibilities.

We are also consolidating 80 technology roles to sites where we are strategically growing our technology teams and capabilities, including Atlanta, Bangalore, New York, Tel Aviv, and Toronto, aligned to Intuit’s site strategy. This strategy allows us to better align these resources with the product and technology teams that are accountable for end-to-end ownership of discrete technology capabilities and critical customer problems. Related to this strategy, we have made the decision to close two of our sites in Edmonton and Boise, where we have over 250 employees, with a certain number of employees relocating to other sites within Intuit or leaving the company.

We are also eliminating more than 300 roles across the company to streamline work and reallocate resources toward key growth areas.

To support everyone leaving, we are providing generous support, including:

Financial: All US employees will receive a package that includes a minimum of 16 weeks of pay, plus two additional weeks for every year of service. All employees in the US will have 60 days before they leave the company with a last day of September 9, 2024. Employees outside the US will receive similar support, taking into account local requirements. This timing allows everyone leaving to reach their July vesting date for restricted stock units (RSUs) and the July 31 eligibility date for annual IPI bonuses. Those not on an IPI plan will be able to reach the eligibility date for July or Q4 incentives.

Health care: We will provide at least six months of health insurance coverage. Everyone leaving will also have access to the Employee Assistance Program to help with mental health support during the transition period.

Career: Each impacted employee will have access to career transition and job placement services. Services include resume development, interviewing techniques, and recruiting and job search help.

Immigration: For those that need immigration support, the extended transition period will allow individuals on visas extra time to look for other roles. Intuit will also provide access to external immigration experts for advice and support at no cost.

Moving forward together

By 9:00 AM PT today, all employees impacted by these changes will receive a calendar invitation from their manager titled “Leaving Intuit Discussion”. Those who do not receive an Outlook invitation by 9:00 AM PT can assume they are not impacted and we ask that you support your colleagues as they process this news.

Today is an incredibly difficult day and our hearts go out to all of you who are leaving Intuit. We sincerely thank you for all you have done for the company. We know you will continue to make a significant impact and achieve great success in your next chapter.

With the strength of our people, culture, and mission, we are positioned to take advantage of this AI revolution and revolutionize our customers’ experiences to deliver undisputed benefits in ways that we could never imagine. Today is “Day 1”. Together, we will focus on the future and all the possibilities to power prosperity around the world.

I will be hosting a Town Hall on Tuesday, July 16 at 9:00 AM PT to answer your questions. Please take good care of yourself and each other.

Sasan

US-based IT company Intuit is cutting jobs. The company announced that it will cut about 1,800 employees. Chief Executive Officer Sasan Goodarzi said in an open letter to employees that 10% of the company's workforce will be impacted by the layoffs.He said that the layoffs are not meant to cut costs and that the company expects to re-hire the same number of employees, primarily in its engineering, product and sales divisions.More than 1,000 of the employees being cut “are not meeting expectations,” Goodarzi said in the letter. The company is also reducing the number of executives by about 10% to increase its “velocity of decision making.”The company expects to close two of its sites in Edmonton, Canada and Boise, Idaho. The letter said that 300 roles were being eliminated to streamline work, while consolidating 80 technology roles to sites such as Atlanta, Bengaluru, Tel Aviv and others as part of the layoff plan.The layoffs will cost Intuit between $250 million and $260 million, with substantial amounts of the charge expected to be incurred in the fourth quarter, the company said in a regulatory filing.Intuit expects to grow headcount in fiscal 2025 and beyond, Goodarzi said.Here's the open letter that CEO Sasan Goodarzi sent to employees as it appears on the company's website.","10% of Intuit’s workforce will be leaving the company.

"How this change by WhatsApp Business may reduce unwanted offer, discount messages on your phones",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-this-change-by-whatsapp-business-may-reduce-unwanted-offer-discount-messages-on-your-phones/articleshow/111667305.cms,"How price change will help WhatsApp users

WhatsApp Business is reportedly revamping its pricing structure for businesses, with a focus on encouraging more service-oriented communication and at the same time, reducing spam flooding users’ WhatsApp chats.Currently, WhatsApp charges businesses based on the category of message sent: Marketing (promotions, new products), Utility (order updates, account info), Authentication (one-time passwords), and Service (customer support).According to a report by TechCrunch, the new rates will be applicable starting from August. While the new utility rates will go into effect from August 4, the new marketing conversation rates will be effective from October 4.The report said that the changes vary by country. In India, for example, marketing message costs will rise by 8%, while utility message costs will plummet by a significant 67%.WhatsApp-parent Meta charges businesses through four categories of messages: Marketing (offers), Utility (order updates), authentication (OTPs, codes) and service (customer inquiries), the report said. The price of the utility message rates will decrease, making it more affordable for businesses to communicate essential information, however, marketing message rates will increase.In March, a report by The Economic Times said that WhatsApp introduced a new category for international OTPs, called ""authentication-international"" priced at Rs 2.3 per message, and significantly increased the price for businesses sending such messages in India. This move reportedly aimed to boost revenue from enterprise messaging services on the platform.Earlier this year, WhatsApp also started testing restrictions on marketing messages sent to a user in India through “Per-User Marketing Template Message Limits” guidelines.“People turn to WhatsApp to do everything from asking questions about a product, receiving a boarding pass, or getting an offer for a holiday sale. There can be too much of a good thing, so we’re working to find the right combination of tools to get this right so people continue having a great experience messaging businesses on WhatsApp,” a Meta spokesperson said told the publication.","WhatsApp Business is reportedly revamping its pricing structure for businesses.

Amazon cloud launches AI service that lets businesses create apps using text prompts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/amazon-cloud-launches-ai-service-that-lets-businesses-create-apps-using-text-prompts/articleshow/111667567.cms,"Amazon brings minor updates to AI agents

Amazon’s cloud unit, Amazon Web Services ( AWS ), kicked off its annual summit in New York. The company announced a bunch of product developments, including some AI refinements as it competes with companies like ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, Google, Microsoft and Facebook-parent Meta .AI chatbots have seen a meteoric rise in recent times with tech giants providing tools and platforms to create them on a requirement basis, allowing them to create chatbots that undertake specific tasks.On similar lines, Amazon launched App Studio – a generative AI-driven service that will help enterprise users to create scalable internal apps by simply describing what they need in natural language. The service is available under a limited preview.“The new AWS App Studio—a generative AI-powered, low-code (meaning the code-writing is mostly done for you) application building service—is the easiest way to create secure applications that can solve business problems in minutes, instead of days or weeks,” the company said.For example, users can say, “Build an app to review and approve invoices” to track inventory. App Studio will generate the new application, including a user interface for listing invoices, a data model for the approval records, and a system for routing those records, Amazon explained.Amazon said it is adding memory to AI agents that automate work for businesses“This allows agents to provide more personalised and more seamless experiences, especially for complicated tasks,” said Vasi Philomin, Amazon's vice president of generative AI , as per Reuters. For example, the updated AI agents can remember a user’s requests that he/ she prefers aisle or window seats on a flight, which was not previously possible.Amazon has also updated the Q chatbot to make improved suggestions for writing software code.","Amazon's cloud unit, Amazon Web Services, kicked off its annual summit in New York.

Apple avoids threat of fines from EU regulators on contactless payments technology,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-avoids-threat-of-fines-from-eu-regulators-on-contactless-payments-technology/articleshow/111666940.cms,"What’s the Apple Pay investigation all about

Apple has agreed to open its tap-and-go payments system to rivals in Europe, European Union antitrust regulator has said. This means that the iPhone maker will avoid the threat of fines by allowing rival wallet developers to use contactless mobile payments technology of Apple Pay for 10 years.“The Commission has decided to accept commitments offered by Apple.These commitments address our preliminary concerns that Apple may have illegally restricted competition for mobile wallets on iPhones,” said European Commission EVP Margrethe Vestager, who heads up the EU’s competition division.“Apple has until July 25 to implement their commitments. As of this date, developers will be able to offer a mobile wallet on the iPhone with the same 'tap and go' experience that so far has been reserved for Apple Pay,” she added.In 2020, the EU launched an antitrust investigation, looking at the terms and conditions Apple sets for integrating Apple Pay in apps and websites. The probe concerned the 'tap and go' technology that uses Near-Field Communication (NFC) and alleged refusals of accessing Apple Pay.Then in 2022, the EU Commission raised concerns that Apple Pay's dominance on iPhones effectively excluded other mobile wallet providers, thereby restricting competition.“Our preliminary finding was therefore that Apple abused its dominant position by refusing to supply the NFC technology to competing mobile wallet developers,” the Commission mentioned.In the settlement, the EU accepted commitments offered by Apple over how it operates Apple Pay to end a long-running competition investigation. This means that iPhone users in the region will be able to use their preferred mobile wallet for payments in stores.“They will be able to do so while enjoying all the iPhone's functionalities, including tap-and-go, Double-Click and FaceID,” the Commission added.Meanwhile, Vestager said the iPhone maker has yet to change its business practices to comply with the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which requires Big Tech to ensure a level playing field for rivals and give users more choice.","Apple has agreed to open its tap-and-go payments system to rivals in Europe.

UK government’s guidance on smartphone use by kids

In a major move, a posh boarding school in the UK has decided to swap its students’ smartphones for the classic Nokia phones, reports CBS News.

Prince William and Harry, Ian Fleming, Tom Hiddleston and novelist George Orwell are some of its notable alumni.As per the report, parents of first-year students at Eton College were informed about the changes in a letter. It reportedly said that the incoming 13-year-old boarders must transfer their SIM cards to offline Nokia phones given by schools. The phone will only be able to make phone calls and send text messages.The report quotes a school spokesperson who said “Eton routinely reviews our mobile phone and devices policy to balance the benefits and challenges that technology brings to schools.” He further added that those joining in Year 9, essentially the equivalent of freshman year in high school for American students, “will receive a 'brick' phone for use outside the school day, as well as a school-issued iPad to support academic study.”According to Ofcom, the UK government's communications regulator, 97% of children have their own smartphone phone by the age of 12. In the new guidelines issued in February this year, the government advised all schools to “have a behaviour policy which is aligned with the school’s legal duties and standards relating to the welfare of children.

Google Fi wireless has introduced a security feature called ‘ Number Lock ’. This new feature empowers users to take control and prevent a growing cybersecurity threat – SIM swapping .SIM swapping occurs when a malicious actor convinces your carrier to transfer your phone number to a new SIM card in their possession. This can grant them access to your calls, texts, two-factor authentication codes, and potentially even financial accounts linked to your number.Google Fi's Number Lock acts as a digital safeguard against SIM swapping attempts.Once activated, this feature essentially locks your phone number to your existing SIM card.
