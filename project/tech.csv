Meet Wiz, the US-Israeli startup

Alphabet , Google 's parent company, is reportedly in talks to acquire cyber security start-up Wiz for about $23 billion, in what would be the largest acquisition in the company's history. According to a report in Wall Street Journal (WSJ), the discussions are still in process and could fall through, with a number of details still needing to be ironed out.If through, the deal would be a major test for antitrust regulators, who have been increasingly scrutinizing acquisitions by tech giants in recent years. Alphabet's last major acquisition was the $12.5 billion purchase of Motorola Mobility over a decade agoThe acquisition of Wiz would represent a significant push into cybersecurity for Alphabet, following its $5.4 billion acquisition of Mandiant two years ago.Founded in 2020 and headquartered in New York, Wiz has raised about $2 billion from investors. The company, led by Israeli founder and former Microsoft executive Assaf Rappaport, was most recently valued at $12 billion. Its backers include venture capital firms Sequoia and Thrive. Wiz has research and development facilities in Tel Aviv.Wiz helps companies secure their cloud programs, which has become increasingly important as businesses move their software and data storage online. The company has reportedly reached $350 million in annual recurring revenue.A deal to acquire Wiz would be one of the largest acquisitions of a venture capital-backed company ever.Wiz declined to comment on the talks, while Google did not respond to a request for comment.

Ultra HDR support

True HDR support has recently gained momentum in smartphones and premium smartphones already support this photo format called Ultra HDR. If you are unfamiliar with this format, it’s an image-capturing technique that utilises computational photography and image stacking to deliver HDR-like output while keeping the image format to SDR.While some phones have already gained support for the Ultra HDR format, the feature hasn’t reached third-party apps like Instagram, Snapchat, etc.And, that’s set to change soon.At the Google I/O event, the company confirmed earlier this year that it will be updating the Camera X API with support for Ultra HDR for wider adoption. Android Authority has reported that it has found that Google has already started adding support for the Ultra HDR with the Camera X version 1.3.0-alpha05 released in April.To make things easier, Google has already included the encoder library within the Android 14 and above versions. With the updated Camera X, the APIs include a new getSupportedOutputFormats method in ImageCaptureCapabilities. This API runs a check whether the smartphone is capable of capturing Ultra HDR or not. Now, the feature should work with Android 14 or newer versions due the integration of the encoder.When the output format is set to OUTPUT_FORMAT_JPEG_ULTRA_HDR on a device that supports Ultra HDR image capture, the CameraX library captures Ultra HDR images in the ""JPEG/R"" format. The ""R"" in ""JPEG/R"" represents ""Recovery map,"" which is the HDR gainmap embedded within the JPEG file.The API description also clarifies that the Ultra HDR images -- as they get captured in SDR format, will appear as a normal JPEG image in non-supported devices, however, it will take on the HDR colour when viewed on the HDR-capable phone or app.As of now, only a handful of devices support the Ultra HDR and that includes Google Chrome on both desktop and mobile, recent Windows PCs and some newly announced phones like OnePlus 12, Galaxy S24 series, Galaxy Z Fold6, Galaxy Z Flip6 and Pixel 8 series.","Google has already started adding support for the Ultra HDR with the Camera X version 1.3.0-alpha05 released in April.

UK government’s guidance on smartphone use by kids

In a major move, a posh boarding school in the UK has decided to swap its students’ smartphones for the classic Nokia phones, reports CBS News.

Prince William and Harry, Ian Fleming, Tom Hiddleston and novelist George Orwell are some of its notable alumni.As per the report, parents of first-year students at Eton College were informed about the changes in a letter. It reportedly said that the incoming 13-year-old boarders must transfer their SIM cards to offline Nokia phones given by schools. The phone will only be able to make phone calls and send text messages.The report quotes a school spokesperson who said “Eton routinely reviews our mobile phone and devices policy to balance the benefits and challenges that technology brings to schools.” He further added that those joining in Year 9, essentially the equivalent of freshman year in high school for American students, “will receive a 'brick' phone for use outside the school day, as well as a school-issued iPad to support academic study.”According to Ofcom, the UK government's communications regulator, 97% of children have their own smartphone phone by the age of 12. In the new guidelines issued in February this year, the government advised all schools to “have a behaviour policy which is aligned with the school’s legal duties and standards relating to the welfare of children.
