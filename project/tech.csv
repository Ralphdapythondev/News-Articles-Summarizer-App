Meta, Apple not launching AI features in EU

Facebook's parent company Meta , along with other prominent tech players like Spotify and Ericsson , have issued a cautionary message to the European Union (EU). They have said that the EU's current technology regulations may hinder the region from fully reaping the potential advantages of artificial intelligence (AI).The Wall Street Journal reports that in an open letter, executives from more than two dozen companies said AI can boost productivity and expand the economy but Europe might reap fewer rewards than other countries.“Europe has become less competitive and less innovative compared to other regions and it now risks falling further behind in the AI era due to inconsistent regulatory decision making,” the letter said, which included signatories from representatives from German software company SAP and German industrial group Thyssenkrupp, along with researchers and civil-society and trade groups.As per the report, the European Commission – EU’s executive body – said that it is working to support AI innovation, adding that the EU’s incoming justice commissioner is expected to make sure that the bloc’s data protection law responds to both law enforcement and commercial needs.The letter comes soon after Meta and Apple announced that the AI features on their platforms and devices will not be available in Europe because of the bloc’s regulations.Recently, Apple said that its new AI system, called Apple Intelligence, will not be available for European iPhone users this year because of what it said were uncertainties caused by a new digital-competition law.Meanwhile, Meta said in July that it will not release a future multimodal AI model in the EU in the near term because of “the unpredictable nature of the European regulatory environment.”","Facebook's parent company Meta, along with other prominent tech players like Spotify and Ericsson, have issued a cautionary message to the European Union (EU) They have said that the EU's current technology regulations may hinder the region from fully reaping the potential advantages of artificial intelligence.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113501463,imgsize-40192,width-400,resizemode-4/113501463.jpg"
Iranian hackers who stole Trump data offered it to people in Biden campaign: FBI,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/iranian-hackers-who-stole-trump-data-offered-it-to-people-in-biden-campaign-fbi/articleshow/113501453.cms,"What the US law officials said

Harris, Trump campaign spokespersons speak

Iranian hackers who stole former US President Donald Trump campaign ’s documents sent excerpts to individuals linked to President Joe Biden's reelection team earlier this summer with an aim to try to influence the 2024 election , law enforcement officials have said.The New York Times reported that the recipients of those documents, however, did not engage.The emails, which were sent in late June and early July, were part of an Iranian effort to steal and distribute sensitive communications from aides working for Trump, the report added.According to the publication, the hackers accessed the email of Roger Stone, a longtime political adviser to Trump.In a joint statement, officials from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the FBI, and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said that “Iranian malicious cyberactors” sent unsolicited emails that included “an excerpt taken from stolen, nonpublic material from former President Trump's campaign.”Federal officials also believe the hackers also targeted the Biden and Harris campaigns but the emails with the stolen Trump material appeared to be intended for his political opponents.Karoline Leavitt, a spokesperson for the Trump campaign, said, “This is further proof the Iranians are actively interfering in the election to help Kamala Harris and Joe Biden because they know President Trump will restore his tough sanctions and stand against their reign of terror.Meanwhile, a spokesperson for the Harris campaign, Morgan Finkelstein, noted that a few people were “targeted on their personal emails with what looked like a spam or phishing attempt”, adding that she was not aware that any material had been sent to campaign accounts.“We have cooperated with the appropriate law enforcement authorities since we were made aware that individuals associated with the then-Biden campaign were among the intended victims of this foreign influence operation,” the spokesperson noted.The Justice Department's national security division is investigating the hack and could bring charges against those responsible as early as this week, the publication cited officials familiar with the matter.","Iranian hackers stole documents from former US President Donald Trump's campaign.

Despite its rapid rise, generative AI is not without its limitations. A recent report by Deutsche Bank Research underscored that while the technology excels in certain areas, it still struggles with tasks like mathematical calculations .While generative AI has proven valuable for tasks such as summarization, translation, and creative content generation, it remains challenged by reasoning, abstract concept learning, and understanding the world.The report emphasized, ""Generative AI is certainly flawed... while it's surprisingly good at some activities, it's surprisingly bad at others, such as making mathematical calculations.""One significant issue is the tendency of generative AI systems to produce hallucinations, or inaccurate information. These systems can also introduce bias or irrelevance into their outputs. Despite ongoing efforts, these problems persist.The report further highlighted that while AI's potential for productivity gains is promising, real-world applications may not always deliver. Highly regulated industries like finance and healthcare, where errors can have severe consequences, have been cautious about adopting generative AI.While generative AI has shown potential in unexpected areas, such as generating novel research ideas and creating game engines, its full potential will only be realized with continued development and careful implementation.","Generative AI has shown potential in unexpected areas, such as generating novel research ideas and creating game engines.

Picture abhi baaki hai (The story isn't over yet)

Today, I celebrate 2 years of being in IndiGo (

InterGlobe Aviation

Ltd) and India. On our 18th IndiGo birthday last month, we celebrated many wonderful milestones and unveiled our ambitious plans for coming years. Our story has just started. I am grateful and proud to be a part of this incredible IndiGo journey with my colleagues - giving wings to the nation with over 2,000 daily flights, 430+ domestic and 100+ international routes, and growing every day.

When I had joined, I had shared the quote, ""Wherever you go, becomes a part of you somehow”. Being a part of IndiGo and now living now in India for two years....IndiGo and this beautiful country India have indeed become a part of me. Bharat ab ghar jaisa lagta hai.

India's essence is captured in its beautiful diversity. Of our 88 domestic cities, I had the pleasure of visiting our great teams in 30. From Thiruvananthapuram in the south to Leh in the north. My most recent visit was to Leh, where walking with my son at 18,000 feet at the Khardung La Pass was very special considering my roots are from a country where the highest ""hill"" is some 300 metres only and around 25% of the land is below sea level 😊

Here are some pictures from my travels in the last two years. Can you guess the cities?

Shark Tank judge Anupam Mittal has responded to Indigo CEO Pieter Elbers ’ post celebrating two years of being in India and Indigo. In a LinkedIn post , Elbers wrote “Being a part of IndiGo and now living now in India for two years....IndiGo and this beautiful country India have indeed become a part of me.

Elon Musk praised Ratan Tata

The legacy of the Tata Nano

Also read

In the realm of business and innovation, few figures command as much respect as Tata Group chairman emeritus Ratan Tata. His influence extends far beyond the Indian corporate world, even garnering admiration from Tesla CEO and X owner Elon Musk . In a 2009 interview with American journalist Charlie Rose , Musk praised Ratan Tata as a ""gentleman and a scholar."" This moment has recently resurfaced, shedding light on Musk's appreciation for Ratan Tata and his ambitious project, the Tata Nano .The Tata Nano was introduced by Tata Motors in 2008 as the world's cheapest car, with a price tag of just Rs 1 lakh (approximately $2,300 at the time). The car was a pet project of Ratan Tata, designed to make automobile ownership accessible to millions of Indians who had never been able to afford a car. The idea was revolutionary—a small, affordable car that would cater to the vast Indian middle class, providing them with a safe and efficient means of transportation.In the interview with Charlie Rose, which took place shortly after the launch of the Tata Nano, the Tesla CEO was asked about his views on Ratan Tata’s efforts to introduce a low-cost car in India. The interview clip, which has recently gone viral, captures Musk's candid response.""Take for a moment Ratan Tata, what he’s doing in India — developing a little sedan for $2300. Where do you put that in the whole equation of where the future of cars is?"" asked Rose.Musk responded with a mix of admiration and caution. He began by acknowledging the brilliance behind the Tata Nano project and the character of Ratan Tata himself.""I think it's a good idea to have affordable cars, but I think the problem with something like the Nano ... I wouldn't say problem because I think, by the way, it is probably a great idea and Ratan is a gentleman and scholar,"" Musk said.However, Musk also expressed his concerns about the long-term viability of such a low-cost vehicle, particularly in the context of rising fuel prices. He pointed out that while the initial purchase cost of the Nano was remarkably low, the cost of running the car—particularly fuel costs—could become a significant issue as gasoline prices continued to rise.""But where it’s going to become challenging in the future is when the price of gasoline rises, the cost of acquiring the car is much less of an issue than the cost of running the car,"" the billionnaire explained.Despite the initial excitement surrounding the Tata Nano, the car faced numerous challenges. One of the most significant issues was its branding. While the Nano was intended to be an affordable vehicle for the masses, it was often labeled as ""cheap"" rather than ""affordable."" This perception problem, combined with safety concerns and competition from other small cars, led to unimpressive sales figures.The Nano’s production was ultimately discontinued in 2018, marking the end of what was initially seen as a groundbreaking project. The car's journey from inception to discontinuation is often cited as one of the biggest marketing failures in the automobile industry.","The Tata Nano was introduced by Tata Motors in 2008 as the world's cheapest car, with a price tag of just Rs 1 lakh (approximately $2,300 at the time) The car was a pet project of Ratan Tata, designed to make automobile ownership accessible to millions of Indians who had never been able to afford a car.

What she wants in a husband

Online reactions and viral response

Also read

A woman’s detailed list of requirements for a future husband has gone viral on social media, sparking widespread reactions. Her profile, shared on X (formerly known as Twitter), includes her own personal details such as her salary, education, and a bold set of expectations for her ideal partner. The unusual demands have generated a mixture of amusement, criticism, and debate among users online.The woman, who earns Rs 1.3 lakh per annum and holds a Bachelor of Education (B.Ed) degree, has raised eyebrows by seeking a techie groom with an annual income of Rs 30 lakh.She further outlined her preferences, stating that her ideal partner should be settled in India, the US, or Europe and should own a spacious 3BHK home. Her love for luxury is evident in her desire to travel frequently and stay in 5-star hotels, which she expects to continue after marriage.The post was shared on X with the caption, “Her qualities and salary. Expected husband’s qualities and salary,” emphasising the stark difference between her modest income and her high expectations for a spouse.Beyond financial expectations, the woman’s list includes several personal and lifestyle requirements. She currently lives with her parents, whom she describes as dependent on her, and expects her future husband to accommodate them in a large independent house. She also made it clear that she is not willing to take on traditional household chores due to her professional commitments, and therefore, she expects her partner to provide a full-time cook and maid.Moreover, she expressed her passion for travel, stating that her husband should share her enthusiasm for exploring the world. She also mentioned that she does not believe in joint family living arrangements and expects her in-laws to reside separately.The profile has garnered over 1.2 million views and has sparked a lively conversation on social media. Many users were shocked by the wide gap between her salary of Rs 1.3 lakh and her demand for a partner earning Rs 30 lakh. Some users questioned the feasibility of her lifestyle expectations, pointing out the disparity between her income and her desire for luxury experiences like 5-star hotels.One user humorously remarked, “She makes Rs 11,000 a month, but she wants a full-time maid and cook? Talk about next-level priorities!” Another comment highlighted the irony, stating, “132000 per annum salary and her hobby is 5-star hotels? And surprise me with Louis Vuitton—that was the highlight.""Others were puzzled by her specific relationship expectations, such as her demand for an unmarried man despite her being divorced, and her insistence that her parents live with her while her in-laws live separately. One user commented, “She’s divorced but wants an unmarried man. Her parents will stay with her, but no in-laws allowed—how fair is that?”While the post has mostly drawn criticism and amusement, it has also led to broader discussions about societal expectations in marriage. Some users defended the woman’s right to have her own preferences, with one person writing, “Everyone is entitled to have their own expectations, but they should be realistic about what they offer in return.” However, the majority of responses leaned towards disbelief, with one user summing up the sentiment by saying, “She will be single if she continues like this.”","A woman's detailed list of requirements for a future husband has gone viral on social media.

Spam and phishing message menace grows in India

What the government’s directive says

Bharti Airtel CEO Gopal Vittal has written a letter to the heads of Reliance Jio , Vodafone Idea , state-run Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd ( BSNL ) and Tata Teleservices, says a report in the Economic Times. In the letter, Vittal proposed creating a collaborative system for sharing information about corporate connections used for commercial calling. This collaborative approach is aimed to monitor and prevent the misuse of these connections.""We are ready to take the first step and share the data (entity name and active numbers only) in the same template on a monthly basis and we would appreciate your support,"" Vittal said in the letter.The letter was sent to Reliance Jio MD Pankaj Pawar, Vodafone Idea CEO Akshaya Moondra, BSNL CMD Robert Ravi and Tata Teleservices MD Harjit Singh Chauhan.""As the telecom industry continues to face the growing challenge of UCC , it has become clear that despite ongoing efforts, more robust and unified mechanisms are required to protect our customers from this persistent issue,"" Vittal said in the letter. He also stressed that in line with the directives of Trai and DoT, the focus remains on finding effective solutions to curb UCC.UCC in the telecom industry means Unsolicited Commercial Communications that describes the combination of communications and collaboration technologies.""We strongly believe that tackling this issue should be a joint endeavour among all telecom operators, rather than isolated efforts,"" he said.Telecom operators must take ""collective responsibility"" in preventing UCC by ensuring that their networks are not exploited by spammers, especially through corporate connections that may be unintentionally facilitating such activities, he said.""Today, enterprise customers are served by multiple operators, and we are seized of the fact that any independent efforts to address spam may not be in the best interests of customers, as it may impact the quality and continuity of services,"" Vittal added.According to industry data, 1.5-1.7 billion commercial messages are sent every day in India, taking the total to about 55 billion every month. As per a survey by community social media platform Local Circles, six in 10 consumers get three or more spam calls each day, with financial services and real estate said to be top offenders. In another survey, 76% consumers said that they get three or more spam messages daily. Blocking numbers doesn't help either.The problem has proven intractable for stakeholders including telcos, the regulator and the government. Recently, the government directed telecom companies to disconnect entities using bulk connections to engage in such activity. Around 350,000 such numbers have been blocked and 50 entities have been blacklisted in the last two weeks.The telecom regulatory authority of India (TRAI) asked telcos to share information on blacklisted entities with each other, so that such entities don't switch from one operator to another.","Bharti Airtel CEO Gopal Vittal has written a letter to the heads of Reliance Jio, Vodafone Idea, state-run Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd ( BSNL ) and Tata Teleservices.

Why pagers and walkie-talkies were used for attack and not mobile phones in Lebanon,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/lebanon-explosions-why-pagers-and-walkie-talkies-were-used-for-attack-and-not-mobile-phones/articleshow/113495129.cms,"Hezbollah chief asked followers to stop using mobile phones

Multiple explosions in Lebanon on September 17 and 18, 2024, resulted in the deaths of 12 people and injuries to over 2,700. The attacks, believed to target members of the militant group Hezbollah , involved detonated pagers and walkie-talkies.Israel has neither confirmed nor denied any role in the explosions, however, according to a report in New York Times , 12 current and former defense and intelligence officials who were briefed on the attack say that the Israelis were behind it, describing the operation as complex and long in the making.This incident highlights the vulnerability of supply chains to sabotage. In the past, the U.S. National Security Agency has been known to intercept computer hardware and insert malware or surveillance tools before delivering it to foreign buyers.Hezbollah's increased use of pagers after the Hamas attack on Israel in October 2023 was likely an attempt to evade Israeli surveillance . By shifting to less technologically advanced communication devices, the group hoped to avoid being tracked through their phones.The widespread use of smartphones has made it easier than ever for governments, companies, and individuals to track people's movements. This can be done through network location data, app tracking, and even built-in features like GPS and Bluetooth. While this can be beneficial for purposes like finding missing persons or combating terrorism, it also raises privacy concerns.Hezbollah's leader had reportedly previously warned members to avoid using cell phones, citing the risk of Israeli surveillance. In February this year, Hezbollah chief, Hassan Nasrallah , reportedly told his followers that Israel was using cellphone networks to pinpoint the locations of his operatives. “You ask me where the agent is,” In a publicly televised address, Nasrallah said, “I tell you that the phone in your hands, in your wife’s hands, and in your children’s hands is the agent.” Then he issued a plea. “Bury it,” Mr. Nasrallah said. “Put it in an iron box and lock it.”The New York Times report added that Nasrallah had been pushing for years for Hezbollah to invest instead in pagers, which for all their limited capabilities could receive data without giving away a user’s location or other compromising information.","Multiple explosions in Lebanon on September 17 and 18, 2024, resulted in the deaths of 12 people and injuries to over 2,700.

As COVID-19 restrictions ease, several major companies are reversing remote work policies , urging employees back to the office. As per reports, companies like X, Amazon , Meta , Apple Google , and others have shifted their hybrid work models to emphasise in-person collaboration. These return-to-office (RTO) mandates are driven by the belief that face-to-face interaction fosters stronger teamwork, innovation, and productivity, while also reinforcing company culture.Many leaders argue that physical presence is essential for mentoring, professional development, and spontaneous problem-solving. This overview highlights the companies enforcing RTO policies and their rationale for prioritising in-office work after the pandemic.Amazon has been at the forefront of reversing remote work policies. CEO Andy Jassy announced in a memo that starting January 2, 2024, corporate employees must return to the office full-time. He emphasised the benefits of in-person collaboration and how it strengthens company culture. This announcement follows a previous mandate that required employees to spend at least three days a week in the office. Some employees, however, expressed frustration, labelling the move as “significantly more strict” compared to pre-pandemic times.Apple reintroduced in-person work with a hybrid schedule starting in August 2022. Employees are required to be in the office at least three days a week. CEO Tim Cook emphasised the importance of “in-person collaboration,” despite pushback from some employees who petitioned against the change. The hybrid model remains in effect, even though some staffers argue that exceptional work can be accomplished remotely.BlackRock, the global investment firm, mandated a four-day office workweek. In a memo, executives emphasised the importance of in-person moments for career development, especially during market-moving events. The company also allows employees some flexibility, offering remote work for two weeks annually. The firm operates from its newly leased office space in New York, which spans 1 million square feet across 15 floors.Chipotle introduced a four-day office workweek for corporate employees in the summer of 2022. Previously, employees had been required to work three days in the office. The shift to four days emphasises the company's belief in in-person collaboration for corporate productivity.Citigroup adopted a hybrid work model for many employees, allowing two remote days per week. However, in May 2023, the company mandated that 600 employees return to the office full-time, aligning with the broader trend among financial institutions like HSBC and Barclays. This is a shift from their earlier policy, which allowed more flexibility for remote work.In January 2023, Disney's CEO Bob Iger mandated a return to office for hybrid workers, requiring them to spend four days a week on-site. This policy faced opposition, with over 2,300 employees signing a petition, arguing that the mandate would slow the company’s post-COVID recovery. Despite the pushback, the policy was implemented, as Iger emphasised the need for in-person collaboration.Goldman Sachs was one of the early adopters of a strict RTO policy. As of March 2022, employees were required to return to the office five days a week. Despite some non-compliance a year into the policy, CEO David Solomon reiterated the need for in-office attendance, citing the benefits of in-person collaboration for the financial industry.Google began calling employees back to the office in April 2022, requiring them to work in-person at least three days a week. In 2023, the company tightened its RTO policy by linking office attendance to employee performance reviews. Google now only allows full-time remote work in exceptional cases, signalling a stronger focus on office collaboration.IBM has taken a stringent approach to RTO, particularly for managers. The company mandated that all U.S.-based managers must work from an office or client location three days a week. Additionally, employees must live within 50 miles of an IBM office or client site. Those unable to comply by the deadline were asked to relocate or separate from the company. CEO Arvind Krishna indicated that career advancement could be more challenging for those working remotely.JPMorgan announced in April 2023 that all managing directors must work from the office five days a week. Despite resistance from some employees, CEO Jamie Dimon has been firm on the policy. He noted that while he understands the inconvenience of long commutes, employees must comply with the office return or find employment elsewhere.Meta updated its remote work policies in September 2023, requiring employees to be in the office three days a week. The company further emphasised compliance by tracking daily attendance, with failure to adhere to the mandate possibly resulting in termination. The return-to-office effort has been met with some frustration from employees due to a lack of adequate office space.Redfin, a real estate company, rolled out its return-to-office policy in 2023. Employees living within 20 miles of Redfin’s offices in Seattle, San Francisco, and Frisco are required to work in the office full-time on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Those living further away must visit the office once a quarter.Salesforce has gradually increased office attendance requirements. By October 2023, select employees in sales, engineering, and customer-facing roles are required to be in the office four to five days a week. The company continues to refine its RTO strategy based on employee feedback.Snap, formerly a “remote-first” company, required employees to return to the office four days a week starting in 2023. The company has implemented WiFi tracking to monitor employee compliance with the mandate.Tesla implemented a strict RTO policy in June 2022, requiring employees to work in the office for at least 40 hours a week. CEO Elon Musk made it clear that failure to comply would be interpreted as a resignation. He argued that Tesla's success was due to his presence in the factories, and he expects the same commitment from employees.After acquiring X in 2022, Elon Musk ended the company's remote work policy. Employees were required to work at least 40 hours a week in the office unless given explicit permission to work elsewhere. Those not showing up were deemed to have resigned.Uber required its employees in 35 locations to return to the office at least half the time starting in April 2022. CEO Dara Khosrowshahi linked the decline in remote work with a drop in frequent customers for the ride-hailing company.In addition to layoffs, Walmart required previously remote employees to relocate to central hubs, including its headquarters in Arkansas. Hybrid work schedules are still allowed, but most workers are expected to be in the office regularly.Zoom, a key player during the remote work era, updated its policies in 2022, asking employees living within 50 miles of an office to return part-time. The shift marks the company’s pivot from fully remote work as it adapts to changing business needs.","Major companies like X, Amazon, Meta, Apple Google, and others have shifted their hybrid work models to emphasise in-person collaboration.

Sarandos recalled Hastings saying, ""We will never do original programming,"" on an earnings call. However, concerns about content differentiation and potential loss of licensed shows to competing platforms led to a change in direction.The shift paid off, with Netflix's second original series, "" House of Cards ,"" receiving critical acclaim and multiple awards.

Icom website shows IC-V82 discontinued

Devices that exploded in Lebanon had no counterfeit-prevention sticker, says company

Walkie-talkies belonging to the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah detonated on Wednesday, killing at least 14 people and injuring more than 450. The incident followed unexpected detonations of pagers the previous day, adding to the already strained relationship between Israel and Lebanon . The sudden detonation sparked chaos among thousands, who frantically sought refuge in surrounding structures.Soon after the blasts, photos emerged showing IC-V82 as the model name on these radios that are manufactured by Icom , a telecommunications equipment maker based in Osaka, Japan.The manufacturer, according to a New York Times report, has said that it had discontinued the device a decade ago and was investigating what happened.In a statement, Icom said that it had not shipped any of the IC-V82 radios from its plant in Wakayama, Japan, in roughly a decade. The company said it had shipped IC-V82 transceivers to overseas markets, including the Middle East, from 2004 to October 2014.Icom further said that it has no inventory of the IC-V82 model and has long warned of counterfeits selling in the market. The company stated that it “has taken legal action against counterfeit manufacturers and has warned about fake models since at least 2020.”Companies manufacturing two-way radios say that the devices generally have a lifespan of about five to seven years. Althout, it can also vary depending on the usage.Classified under Type-2, the website says “Almost all Type 2 products are counterfeit. It has been a long time since the products were discontinued. Purchase the new models, such as the IC-V80 and IC-2300H (with a genuine hologram label).” Icom products classified under the Tupe-2 category include IC-V8, IC-U80, IC-V85, IC-V82, IC-M304 and IC-2200H that have no production/inventory.“Pay special attention to counterfeit IC-V80, IC-718 (currently produced model) and IC-V82 (discontinued model). Copies of these models are floating in the market,” the company further added.Icom said that because the devices that exploded in Lebanon were not fixed with the counterfeit-prevention sticker. Because of which, the company said, it is not possible to confirm whether they had originated with the company.The company further defended saying that it sells products only to authorized distributors and that it upholds strict export controls based on regulations set by Japan’s economy ministry.","Photos emerged showing IC-V82 as the model name on these radios that are manufactured by Icom, a telecommunications equipment maker based in Osaka, Japan.

Take a look at the post

Neuralink announces Blindsight device

What X users said

Elon Musk-owned brain chip startup Neuralink recently got FDA approval for its experimental vision implant - Blindsight. Taking to microblogging site X (formerly Twitter), Musk wrote “The Blindsight device from Neuralink will enable even those who have lost both eyes and their optic nerve to see.” Replying to his post, Mahindra Group Chairman Anand Mahindra said “If this device lives up to these expectations then, much more than Tesla or SpaceX, THIS will be your most enduring gift to humankind.”Announcing the device, the company said “We have received Breakthrough Device Designation from the FDA for Blindsight.Join us in our quest to bring back sight to those who have lost it. Apply to our Patient Registry and openings on our career page.”In a separate post, Musk said: “The Blindsight device from Neuralink will enable even those who have lost both eyes and their optic nerve to see. Provided the visual cortex is intact, it will even enable those who have been blind from birth to see for the first time. To set expectations correctly, the vision will at first be low resolution, like Atari graphics, but eventually, it has the potential to be better than natural vision and enable you to see in infrared, ultraviolet or even radar wavelengths, like Geordi La Forge. Much appreciated @US_FDA!”However, Neuralink has yet to share details about when it expects the Blindsight device to move into human trials.Commenting on Mahindra’s post, an X user said “This man is on a mission .. inspirational Elon musk”. Another user said “Changing lives in a way that surpasses even the wildest sci-fi dreams!”.“If it fulfills its promise, this device could revolutionize our future in ways even Tesla and SpaceX have yet to achieve,” commented another.","Elon Musk-owned brain chip startup Neuralink recently got FDA approval for its experimental vision implant - Blindsight.

What happened in the past

Binance - the world's biggest crypto exchange platform has refuted any association with the WazirX hack in July this year. In a blog post, the company said that it “has no responsibility for the operation of the WazirX platform and the consequences of the alleged hack”.Stating that Binance is not a party to WazirX’s User Agreement, and references to Binance in this Agreement are unauthorized, the company further added “Zanmai/Zettai and their affiliates accept that they still operate WazirX and that Binance was not involved in the operation of WazirX or the compromised wallet at the time of the attack.”The post goes on to further state that Zanmai Labs Pvt Ltd (a company incorporated in India) is the legal entity that registered the WazirX platform with the Indian FIU.“India’s Directorate of Enforcement, having investigated the WazirX exchange, has stated that Zanmai is the owner of WazirX,” it added.On July 18, 2024 WazirX reported that it had suffered a cyber-attack, resulting in the loss of user funds with a market value of around $235 million. The alleged hack precipitated withdrawal requests from WazirX customers that WazirX cannot meet up to this day.“Their responsibility to WazirX users is unrelated to their dispute with Binance. Their attempts to shift responsibility is a disappointing deflection tactic, but it should not distract anyone from the glaring issue to be addressed here: the need for the WazirX team to be held accountable for user funds lost under their management,” the blog post stated.The blog post states that Binance never acquired or controlled WazirX. “While a contract had been signed between the parties, the proposed transaction never closed due toZettai ’s failure to perform its obligations. Binance has never owned, controlled, or operated WazirX at any time, including before, during, or after the alleged hack.”In its blog post, Binance states that “At all times, Mr. Shetty’s (WazirX co-founder and CEO Nishchal Shetty) team retained ownership and control over WazirX. Zanmai, Zettai, and Mr. Shetty accept that they still operate and have always operated WazirX. For example, Mr. Shetty publicly stated on his social media account on 30 September 2023 that ‘I’m still running WazirX’.”“Mr. Shetty suggests that the outcome of the current dispute between Zettai and Binance may result in a determination that Binance owns WazirX and that this would result in the creditors of Zettai becoming creditors of Binance, with the implication that Binance would be responsible for making WazirX users whole. This is wrong,” .In 2019, Binance announced that the crypto exchange has acquired WazirX. Later, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao in August 2022 said on X (formerly Twitter) that his firm didn’t own any equity in WazirX nor did it control its operations.At the recent town hall meeting addressing the $230-million crypto asset theft, WazirX’s Nishchal Shetty and his legal advisors stated that Binance controlled most of WazirX parent Zettai's revenues, cash flows, and profits. This arrangement, they claimed, limited WazirX's ability to compensate affected customers using its own financial resources.","Binance - the world's biggest crypto exchange platform has refuted any association with the WazirX hack in July this year.

"FBI director warns, China-linked hackers breaking into routers and IoT devices to run Botnets",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/fbi-seizes-major-botnet-network-controlled-by-chinese-hacking-group/articleshow/113472296.cms,"What FBI director said about the botnet

Chinese hacking groups attacking US, Taiwan

FBI has seized a major botnet network controlled by a Chinese government-backed hacking group. According to FBI director Christopher Wray and other US agencies, the botnet network consisted of hundreds of thousands of compromised internet-connected devices, including cameras, video recorders, storage units, and routers, all controlled by the group. At the Aspen Cyber Summit cybersecurity conference, Wray said the hacking group, dubbed Flax Typhoon , was “targeting critical infrastructure across the US and overseas, everyone from corporations and media organisations to universities and government agencies.”Botnet networks comprises of internet-connected devices run by bots that can be used by hackers for distributed denial-of-service attacks (DDoS) attacks, data theft, spam campaigns and unauthorised access to the devices and their network connections.Wray described what happened once the authorities started removing the malware from the compromised devices after taking control of the botnet’s infrastructure.He explained: “Working in collaboration with our partners, we executed court-authorised operations to take control of the botnet’s infrastructure. Now, when the bad guys realised what was happening, they tried to migrate their bots to new servers and even conducted a [Distributed Denial of Service or DDoS] attack against us.”The FBI, NSA and the Cyber National Mission Force have also issued a joint advisory linking a botnet of 260,000 compromised devices to the Chinese government. The advisory revealed that the botnet was used to mask the activities of Chinese hackers. According to the US government, the botnet was operated and controlled byIntegrity Technology Group , a company allegedly working on behalf of the Chinese government.According to the advisory, the botnet infiltrated vulnerable internet-connected devices using Mirai. In 2016, this dangerous malware was open-sourced after hackers employed it to launch a powerful distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack.The Flax Typhoon operation targeted a vast array of consumer internet-connected devices, the advisory noted. Authorities also discovered a database containing “over 1.2 million records of compromised devices,” including more than 385,000 unique US victim devices, both previously and currently exploited.As per reports published by Microsoft and cybersecurity group ESET, the Chinese government hacking group Flax Typhoon have been targeting Taiwan. Meanwhile, another Chinese group named Volt Typhoon has been attacking the US.Earlier this year, Flax Typhoon compromised Microsoft Exchange servers in Taiwan, while Volt Typhoon targeted US internet providers and critical infrastructure. The US government has disrupted the activities of Volt Typhoon and warned of the potential for destructive cyberattacks. Senior officials have cautioned about efforts by Beijing to cause “real-world harm” to Americans in the event of a conflict with China in the future.","FBI has seized a major botnet network controlled by a Chinese government-backed hacking group.

What telecom operators told TRAI

The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India ( TRAI ) has proposed new recommendations aimed at simplifying the licensing process under Telecom Act. Importantly, the regulatory body has excluded Over-The-Top (OTT) services like WhatsApp Google ’s RCS, Telegram and other such platforms under this licensing regime.The new recommendations advocate for a single, unified authorisation system across different services and regions - a “One Nation One Authorization” framework.As per TRAI recommendation, any entity that holds this authorisation can provide mobile service, internet service, broadband service, landline telephone service, long distance service, satellite communication service, Machine to Machine (M2M) and internet of Things (IoT) service on a pan India basis.Furthermore, TRAI's proposals include enabling satellite-based services to offer voice calling and messaging features, broadening the spectrum of services available within the telecom sector. The regulatory body also advocates for the shared utilisation of both active and passive infrastructure amongst service providers – which can potentially result in greater efficiency and a decrease in operational expenses.Additionally, in a move to ease the financial strain on telecom operators, TRAI has suggested the gradual elimination of entry fees during the process of authorization renewal.The exclusion comes despite pressure from telecom companies like Reliance Jio , Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea that wanted these platforms to be regulated in a simialr fashion as the traditional telecom services.According to a report by Economic Times last month, the telcos asked TRAI to create licences or permissions for OTT (over-the-top) communication apps, arguing that they provide similar services to what mobile phone operators offer.Meanwhile, OTT apps opposed this, claiming that they are already regulated under the Information Technology Act.","TRAI has proposed new recommendations aimed at simplifying the licensing process under Telecom Act.

The platform is introducing a new feature that allows creators to break their videos into seasons and episodes, similar to the format used by Netflix and other streaming services.This new formatting will make it easier for viewers to navigate and find specific content within a channel.It's a significant step for YouTube as it continues to expand its presence in the living room, where YouTuber revenue on TVs has increased by 30% year over year.Although YouTube hasn't provided details on how the new formatting will appear on desktop and mobile devices, it's expected to be available across all platforms. In addition to the season and episode feature, creators will also have access to other TV-focused tools, such as the ability to add immersive content that plays directly on their channel page.Previously, some YouTubers had created seasons and episodes for their shows by using playlists and numbered naming conventions. However, this method often resulted in a less user-friendly experience on TV platforms like Apple TV and Roku.
