The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India ( TRAI ) extended the deadline to stop transmitting messages containing URLs , OTT links , APKs (Android application packages), or call-back numbers that are not whitelisted (or registered with telcos) by a month.The change was due to come into effect on September 1, and Airtel, Reliance Jio and Vodafone-Idea want extension in the deadline, a previous report said.After a one-month extension, the change will go into effect on October 1. The move is aimed at curbing spam and phishing attempts by scammers who try to dupe people using SMS.“In response to the requests by the Access Providers for additional time, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has granted a one-month extension to Access Providers to comply with its Direction issued on August 20, 2024, regarding the whitelisting of URLs/APKs/OTT links,” TRAI said.“The revised Direction mandates that all Access Providers ensure that traffic containing URLs/APKs/OTT links, which are not whitelisted, is not permitted with effect from October 1, 2024,” it added.As per the current rules, entities register their headers and templates with telcos but not the content of messages, which means that operators do not have any information on the content of transmitted messages.However, starting next month, telcos must create a mechanism to read the content of commercial messages and block those that do not match their records.“This step aims to curb the misuse of Headers and Content Templates, ensuring a more secure and efficient telecom ecosystem. Further, in consideration of the issues brought out by Access Providers, the revised timeline for implementing call back numbers will be fixed separately,” it said.“The TRAI has directed all Access Providers to furnish to the Authority an updated status on action taken within fifteen days and a compliance report within thirty days from date of issue of this Direction,” TRAI added.In India, 1.5-1.7 billion commercial messages are sent daily, totaling about 55 billion every month, according to industry data.","The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India extended the deadline to stop transmitting messages containing URLs, OTT links and APKs.

What to know about Pavel Durov

Why Durov left Russia in 2014

Telegram's 'controversial role' in the Ukraine war

Elon Musk comes in support of Pavel

Telegram chief executive Pavel Durov was arrested at a Paris airport for offences related to his popular messaging app. Durov was detained at Le Bourget airport in Paris after arriving on a private jet. Telegram is an encrypted messaging app, ranked as one of the major social media platforms after Facebook, YouTube, WhatsApp, Instagram , TikTok and WeChat.Durov is accused of failing to take action to curb the criminal use of his platform. He faces investigation for allegedly allowing a wide range of crimes due to a lack of moderators on Telegram and lack of cooperation with police. A cybersecurity gendarmerie unit and France 's national anti-fraud police unit are leading the investigation.Encrypted messaging app Telegram allows groups of up to 200,000 members, which has led to accusations that it makes it easier for false information to spread virally. There are also accusations that the app is used to disseminate neo-Nazi, paedophilic, conspiratorial and terrorist content. Telegram has committed to never disclosing information about its users.The 39-year-old technology billionaire Pavel Durov holds dual French and UAE citizenship and has been vocal about keeping Telegram a neutral platform. According to Russian and French media, Durov became a French citizen in 2021. Durov is estimated by Forbes to have a fortune of $15.5 billion. Telegram was created by Durov and his brother Nikolai, a programmer and mathematician. The app is said to have around 900 million active users. Durov has also accused the FBI of seeking a backdoor into Telegram.Durov reportedly left Russia in 2014 after refusing to comply with demands to shut down opposition communities on his VK social media platform. Durov, however, has not said whether he renounced his Russian citizenship.Telegram app is particularly influential in Russia, Ukraine and the republics of the former Soviet Union. Telegram has become a major source of unfiltered content from both sides of the Ukraine war. Ukrainian and Russian governments both use Telegram heavily. The platform has become what some analysts call 'a virtual battlefield' for the war, used heavily by Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and his officials, as well as the Russian government.Tesla CEO Elon Musk posted the hashtag #FreePavel on the X social media platform, formerly Twitter.

“$ is not just a currency symbol. It is embedded in many programming language syntaxes such as:

- Variables are also written like this $1, $2 in bash syntax.”

“Only a person who works on MS Excel knows the answer. $ is used to freeze a Row or column in Excel formulas and ₹ can't do that. That's why $ is used universally for that purpose . However, you can anytime use ₹ on your computer.”

“Bhavish, I recommend you ask the software engineers in your company rather than Twitter! :),”

What is Whitelisting or URLs

Similar disruption in 2021

Starting September 1, consumers might experience disruptions in receiving service and transactional messages from banks, financial institutions, and e-commerce firms on their mobile phones. This follows a directive from the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) aimed at reducing spam, particularly phishing attempts.Trai has instructed telecom companies to stop transmitting messages containing URLs, OTT links, APKs (Android application packages), or call-back numbers that are not whitelisted—registered with telcos—by senders from September 1.This directive means that banks, financial institutions, and online platforms must register their message templates and content with operators by August 31. If they fail to do so, messages containing these elements will be blocked.Currently, entities register their headers and templates with telcos but not the content of messages. This means operators do not check the content of transmitted messages. However, starting next month, telcos must create a mechanism to read the content of commercial messages and block those that do not match their records, according to experts.In India, 1.5-1.7 billion commercial messages are sent daily, totaling about 55 billion every month, according to industry data.Airtel, Reliance Jio and Vodafone-Idea want extension in deadlineAccording to a report in Economic Times, industry executives say the telecom sector is seeking more time from Trai to implement the mandate as the blockchain-based distributed ledger technology (DLT) platform needs updating. However, the regulator believes it has given sufficient time to the telcos and is unwilling to extend the deadline, according to officials familiar with the matter.Bharti Airtel, Reliance Jio, and Vodafone Idea did not respond to ET’s queries.Whitelisting requires entities sending messages to provide all information related to URLs, call-back numbers, etc., to telcos, who will then feed the information into their DLT platform. If the information matches, the message is passed; otherwise, it is blocked.For example, most transactional messages from banks, such as funds debit or credit, contain a call-back number. Transmission of such messages will be stopped if a bank does not whitelist the number.“Only those entities, including banks, which whitelist their URLs or content of the messages with telcos, will pass through; the rest will be blocked,” said a telecom industry executive.Mobile consumers faced a similar outage in March 2021 when the DLT platform was implemented, and telcos started scrubbing messages. At that time, there was widespread disruption as telcos blocked all commercial messages that did not contain whitelisted headers and templates. Following the disruption, all entities have since registered their headers and templates with telcos.Experts say that in the current scenario, an increasing number of messages may shift to over-the-top (OTT) platforms like WhatsApp and Google’s rich communication services (RCS) messaging, as there is no such mandate from Trai to govern them. However, banking messages, where rules do not permit transmission over OTT, will be blocked if the entities have not been whitelisted, the experts added.","Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) has instructed telecom companies to stop transmitting messages containing URLs, OTT links, APKs, or call-back numbers that are not whitelisted by senders.

Speaking to Engadget, Google’s director of product management for Pixel wearables, Sandeep Waraich, said, “Pixel Watch is our smartwatch part of the portfolio”. Waraich said the same in response to a question about the future of the Fitbit-branded smartwatches, adding that Pixel Watch is “our next iteration of smartwatch for Fitbit.”But while you may not get Fitbit smartwatches, Fitbit brand per se is not being killed. Google will continue to make Fitbit fitness bands . Fitbit-branded products will focus on trackers that are “more minimalistic” with long battery life, said Waraich.As to what happens to Fitbit smartwatch customers . Google said, ""We are very committed to Fitbit, and even more importantly to the customers that use and depend on those products and technology. It's also worth noting that many of the health and fitness features we launched in Pixel Watch 3 were because of Fitbit's innovation and ground-breaking fitness advancements. In addition, we just launched Fitbit Ace LTE , and you’ll continue to see new products and innovation from Fitbit.""This means that Google will continue to provide software updates, and even new features to both devices.As for Pixel Watch fans, Google has launched Pixel Watch 3 in India, starting at RS 39,99.
