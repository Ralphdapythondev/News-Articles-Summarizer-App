Microsoft ’s annual developer conference, Build 2024, is set to kick off today (May 21). The event's keynote, which the company’s CEO Satya Nadella will deliver, will start at 9 am PT (10.30 pm IST). To address the keynote, Nadella will be joined by multiple executives including Rajesh Jha , Mustafa Suleyman and Kevin Scott. With the theme “How will AI shape your future,” the company is expected to announce its AI advancements for multiple products.This event will be held both in-person and virtually. The live stream will be available on the Microsoft Developer YouTube channel starting at 9 pm today (May 21).Users can also watch the event and get information about the session on Microsoft's website. For this, users have to visit build.microsoft.com and fill out the free registration process.In a blog post announcing the event, the company wrote: “Whether you’re tuning in online (for free) or joining us in person in Seattle, prepare to be immersed in the latest innovations in Microsoft developer tools and technologies. Microsoft Build also offers unparalleled opportunities to network and create valuable connections with industry leaders and like-minded professionals.”At this event, Microsoft is expected to announce new AI capabilities for bothWindows and Office as well as Copilot chatbot’s deeper integration with Windows 11 as well as other Outlook products like Word, Excel and Outlook.These tools will help the Microsoft Office tools compete against Workspace which will now support Gemini-based AI features that the company announced for its collaborative suite at Google I/O 2024.As Azure still lags behind Amazon’s AWS, the company is also expected to introduce new products and solutions within its cloud platform. These tools will help developers use AI in new ways to further expand Microsoft's AI ecosystem.Last year, Microsoft unveiled its AI assistant Windows Copilot and revealed that Bing will become ChatGPT's default service for web browsing. According to a report by Tom’s Guide, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman or CTO Mira Muratti may also come to the stage during the keynote.","Microsoft's annual developer conference, Build 2024, is set to kick off today (May 21) The event's keynote, which the company’s CEO Satya Nadella will deliver, will start at 9 am PT.

"Google highlights 'Microsoft's security failures' to the US government, says it can help",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-highlights-microsofts-security-failures-to-the-us-government-says-it-can-help/articleshow/110285108.cms,"What Google is offering government agencies and corporate customers



Google has released a white paper highlighting Microsoft 's latest security lapses. In this report, the search giant has reviewed the cybersecurity failures of the Windows parent that recently became public and has shared the same with the US government . The company may have also suggested to Microsoft’s government and enterprise customers that switching to Google Workspace can help them.The company has also reportedly offered discounts to government agencies who are willing to switch to the company’s collaborative suite. Google wants to use this white paper to lure corporate and government customers to use its productivity software rather than Microsoft Office which it claims to be unsafe.In the white paper (seen by Bloomberg), Google said: “The repeated security challenges with Microsoft called for a better alternative for enterprises and public-sector organisations alike. We believe Google Workspace presents a safer alternative, with a proven track record of engineering excellence, deep investment in cutting edge defences, and a transparent culture where providing security for customers is treated as a profound responsibility.”According to a report by Bloomberg, government agencies that switch 500 or more users to Google Workspace Enterprise Plus for three years will get one year free. In an interview, the senior director of product management for Workspace, Andy Wen said that these agencies will also be eligible for a “significant discount” for the rest of the contract.As per the report, the Alphabet-owned company is also offering 18 months free to corporate customers who sign a three-year contract. The company is also likely to offer a hefty discount after that along with its incident response services from Google’s Mandiant security business. All customers will also receive free consulting services to help them make the switch.The US Cyber Safety Review Board recently issued a report that showed Microsoft’s inability to stop China-linked hackers from breaking into the email accounts of US officials in 2023.

Amazon faces lawsuits in the US over this practice that India has 'banned',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/amazon-faces-lawsuits-in-the-us-over-this-practice-that-the-indian-government-has-banned/articleshow/110282449.cms,"What are “dark patterns”



What Amazon has to say about the new lawsuit



“a single document from Amazon, resulting in a fundamental misunderstanding and mischaracterisation of how Amazon’s businesses work.”

Amazon is facing two new lawsuits in the US. One of the lawsuits filed by Arizona's Attorney General Kris Mayes accuses the e-commerce giant of engaging in deceptive business practices, the Verge reported.The lawsuit alleges that the company violated the state’s Consumer Fraud Act by using design tricks also known as “dark patterns” to keep users from cancelling their Amazon Prime subscriptions.The US-based company is also facing a similar lawsuit from the country’s Federal Trade Commission (FTC) which was filed in June 2023.These "" dark patterns "" on e-commerce websites are said to be intended to deceive customers or manipulate their choices. Last year, India banned these practices and decided to impose a penalty on e-tailers using them as per the Consumer Protection Act.A gazette notification from the government in December 2023 defined dark patterns as a practice or deceptive pattern that uses its UI or user’s past interactions with a platform to mislead or trick users into doing something they originally did not want to do. With such tactics, e-commerce platforms can undermine or weaken the consumer’s choice or decision-making.To protect consumers' interests, the government banned the use of ""dark patterns"" on e-commerce platforms under the guidelines issued by the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA).According to a report by The Verge, Amazon spokesperson Tim Doyle said that the company was “surprised and disappointed by these cases.”Doyle added that the Arizona AG filed the lawsuit without reviewingMeanwhile, the other lawsuit filed against Amazon accuses the company of breaking Arizona’s Uniform State Antitrust Act by unfairly maintaining monopoly status.This regulatory lawsuit alleges that the company has enforced agreements with third-party sellers that restrict them from offering lower prices on other platforms than what they do on Amazon.The anti-trust suit also used the state’s Consumer Fraud Act to target Amazon’s Buy Box algorithm .

According to media reports, protesters blocked the entrance of Google’s developer conference in Mountain View for reportedly roughly 90 minutes, demanding that the tech giant drop its work with the Israeli government amid the country’s war with Hamas in the Gaza Strip.Google security personnel closed the entrance and redirected the crowd, ensuring the event itself started on schedule. The security closed the entrance as protesters moved to stand in front, leaving a large line of attendees who were later directed to another area to proceed to the conference.Groups including the ' No Tech for Apartheid ' coalition and other groups from across the Bay Area held a sign reading “Google stop fueling genocide”. They chanted “we won’t stop till Nimbus gets dropped,” referencing the $1.2 billion project supported by Amazon and Google that provides artificial intelligence and cloud computing services to the Israeli government.Last month, Google fired over 50 workers for participating in a pro-Palestinian protest that saw them occupy Google campuses in New York City and Sunnyvale, California.In its defense, Google maintains that its technology serves numerous governments globally, including Israel. The company emphasizes that Project Nimbus is a standard commercial cloud service and that the Israeli government has agreed to adhere to Google's established terms of service and acceptable use policy. Google further clarifies that the project excludes ""highly sensitive, classified, or military workloads relevant to weapons or intelligence services"".“This work is not directed at highly sensitive, classified, or military workloads relevant to weapons or intelligence services,” Google said in an April statement.","Protesters chained themselves together in front of the entrance to Google’s annual developer conference, Google I/O, last week.

""While I don't inherently oppose linking out, my priority is ensuring a secure solution for our customers.""Earlier in the hearing, a judge raised questions about the justification for the 27% fee. Apple presented a commissioned study suggesting a fee around half that amount would be reasonable.Carson Oliver, a senior director at Apple, revealed the company hired a consulting firm to determine a new commission rate . However, the judge pressed Oliver on the significant difference between the study's lowest proposed rate (12.3%) and Apple's chosen 27% fee.""What justifies this additional 15% charge?"" the judge inquired.Oliver argued that Apple offers developers valuable services beyond just payment processing, including app discovery, distribution tools, and security features. He estimated the true minimum cost to be closer to 17%, based on comparisons with other platforms.The judge remained skeptical, pointing out the lack of concrete data to support Apple's assumptions about the effective rate being lower than 27%.

This translates to a significant boost, especially for users who don't use their phones constantly but still experience battery drain throughout the day.The improved Doze mode is expected to be a general feature across all devices receiving the Android 15 update. While the exact improvement in standby time might vary depending on individual phone models and usage patterns, it signifies a positive step towards better battery management for the entire Android ecosystem.The focus on battery optimization extends beyond smartphones. Google hinted that the next iteration of their smartwatch platform, Wear OS 6, will also benefit from the faster Doze mode functionality.

Apple may bring iPhone 16 series in two new colours: Details,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/mobiles-tabs/apple-may-bring-iphone-16-series-in-two-new-colours-details/articleshow/110260524.cms,"

Pro models may get a new Rose colour

Apple

may rename existing colours

Apple iPhone 16 series launch is months away. But the rumour mill is buzzing with expected features, design and now colour of the 2024 iPhone lineup. Popular Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo says that the Cupertino-based company may add two new colours to the iPhone 16, replacing the existing ones.The information was shared by Kuo in a post on X, formerly Twitter .In the post, Kuo says that the Pro models - iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max could be offered in black, white or silver, gray or ""Natural Titanium,"" and an all-new rose. The existing iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max are offered in Black Titanium, White Titanium, Blue Titanium and Natural Titanium colours.Kuo reveals that the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus are expected to come in black, green, pink, blue and white colour variants. Apple may also rename previous colours as well, Kuo adds. For example, the existing white could be renamed to starlight. “Also, even if the colour name is the same as the existing model, it may look different”, he says.Earlier, Kuo said that the iPhone 16 Pro Max is expected to feature a new battery with better energy density, potentially enhancing battery life if Apple maintains the same battery size. According to Kuo, iPhone 16 Pro Max will reportedly see a substantial redesign of its battery, switching from an aluminium to a stainless steel casing. This shift not only increases the battery's energy density but also improves its structural integrity.

Hinton is against the use of AI technology in the military



Geoffrey Hinton , the software engineer who is often regarded as the “godfather of artificial intelligence” has said that he is “very worried” that the artificial intelligence technology “taking lots of mundane jobs”, and said that it will be on to the governments to deal with the impact of artificial intelligence ( AI ) on income inequality.Hinton, who worked at Google until last year, said that while AI will increase productivity and wealth, the money would go to the rich “and not the people whose jobs get lost and that’s going to be very bad for society”.He noted that the government will have to establish a universal basic income , which means that the government will have to pay all individuals a set basic salary regardless of their means.“I was consulted by people in Downing Street and I advised them that universal basic income was a good idea,” Hinton, who left Google to talk more freely about the dangers of unregulated AI, told BBC.Hinton previously said that some of the dangers of AI chatbots were “quite scary”. He is of the view that chatbots can become more intelligent than humans and may be exploited by “bad actors”.AI could “evolve to get the motivation to make more of itself” and can autonomously “develop a sub-goal of getting control”, pointing out evidence of large language models choosing to be deceptive.""My guess is in between five and 20 years from now there’s a probability of half that we’ll have to confront the problem of AI trying to take over,” he said.As per Hinton, this will lead to an “extinction-level threat” for humans because they may have “created a form of intelligence that is just better than biological intelligence… That's very worrying for us”.“What I’m most concerned about is when these can autonomously make the decision to kill people,"" he added.","Geoffrey Hinton, the ‘godfather of artificial intelligence’ has said that he is ‘very worried’ that the artificial intelligence technology ‘taking lots of mundane jobs’ Hinton said that while AI will increase productivity and wealth, the money would go to the rich ‘and not the people whose jobs get lost’","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110254760,imgsize-126994,width-400,resizemode-4/110254760.jpg"

AI's expanding role in media

In a bold move at the Cannes Film Festival, Polish director Patryk Vega unveiled his latest project, a biopic titled ""Putin,"" featuring an AI-generated deepfake of Russian President Vladimir Putin . The film, which has already been sold in 50 countries ahead of its September premiere, uses advanced artificial intelligence to replicate Putin's face on a real actor’s body.Vega, known for his popular Polish films, decided to use AI technology to create a more authentic portrayal of Putin.""To come extremely close to the dictator, we needed Putin, not an actor with make-up,"" Vega explained. The film’s trailer opens with a striking scene of the Russian leader cowering on the floor in diapers, setting the tone for its controversial narrative.As per an ET report, Vega humorously recounted his approach: ""I called Putin and asked him if he wanted to play in my movie... No, that was a joke."" Despite the jest, the director utilised AI to generate Putin's face due to the lack of sufficient high-resolution images for a full-body deepfake. The results, according to early viewers, are uncannily realistic.""Putin"" chronicles the life of the Russian president over six decades, starting from his childhood at age 10, where he is depicted being beaten by his stepfather. The film culminates in a fictional portrayal of his death, which Vega describes as ""a happy end.""The concept for the biopic emerged during the early days of Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Initially, Vega aimed to make a film about the Russian mafia but shifted focus to what he considered ""the biggest gangster.""Despite potential risks, Vega dismisses fears of reprisals, boldly stating, ""Putin should be afraid of me."" The director's venture into AI has broader implications for the film industry, particularly in Hollywood, where the technology is both a boon and a source of concern. AI advancements threaten traditional roles, especially among special effects technicians and extras, raising fears of job losses.These concerns were central to last year's strike by actors and writers, culminating in an agreement that included compensation for the use of AI-generated likenesses. Despite apprehensions, AI is already extensively used in the industry. For example, it was employed to de-age Harrison Ford in the latest ""Indiana Jones"" film, though studios often refrain from publicising these uses.Beyond film production, AI's applications are expanding in various sectors of the media. The Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media, for instance, uses algorithms to analyse screenplays for gender and diversity biases. YouTube, a significant player in film promotion and distribution, has leveraged AI for over a decade, employing it for automated subtitles and copyright protections.Since April, YouTube has begun labelling AI-generated content and enhancing its detection programs. Justine Ryst, head of YouTube France, emphasised that ""AI isn't going to take over creation. It's going to simplify the complex, and make possible the impossible."" She advocated for a balance between innovation and responsibility in utilising AI.","Polish director Patryk Vega unveiled his latest project, a biopic titled ""Putin,"" featuring an AI-generated deepfake of Russian President Vladimir Putin. The film, which has already been sold in 50 countries ahead of its September premiere, uses advanced artificial intelligence to replicate Putin's face.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110269437,imgsize-27846,width-400,resizemode-4/110269437.jpg"

Watch: Sam Altman shares how he spent the 4-and-a-half days he was sacked as ChatGPT maker OpenAI CEO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/watch-sam-altman-shares-how-he-spent-the-four-and-a-half-days-he-was-sacked-as-chatgpt-maker-openai-ceo/articleshow/110203159.cms,"Sam Altman talks GPT-4o and Predicts the Future of AI

The big lesson learnt

Sam Altman , CEO of OpenAI , has been on a rollercoaster the last few years. Since the company's release of ChatGPT, he's widely regarded as the poster boy of Generative-AI world. He's met with world leaders, clashed with Elon Musk , and even joined the billionaire club. Amidst all this, he also got fired (briefly) from the company he co-founded.On a recent tech podcast ""The Logan Bartlett Show"", Altman said with a laugh that if he had more time to reflect, ""every day would have something crazy."" However, one truly surreal moment stands out: His four-day ousting from OpenAI.As reported by Business Insider, it wasn't the firing itself that was unreal. It was how he handled this bizarre situation. Altman described it as an ""insane, superjammed"" 4 ½ days where his body was in an ""adrenaline-charged state.""Within a day of being fired, world leaders started texting. He received messages from 10-20 presidents and prime ministers. He said it felt normal at the time, and he even thanked them without batting an eye.""It was just weird,"" Altman admitted. He barely slept or ate, but his focus and energy were off the charts.Once he got his job back, reality hit him. Stopping at a diner, he realized he hadn't eaten in days. Naturally, he celebrated with a feast: four ""heavy"" meals and two milkshakes (just for him!).The celebratory meal was great, but the real shocker came later. A president texted him, relieved things were settled.Suddenly, Altman realized how bizarre it all was. World leaders texting him during his firing shouldn't have felt normal, but it did. It showed him just how adaptable humans are.""We can get used to anything as the new normal, good or bad, pretty fast,"" Altman said. He sees this as a strength – humans can adapt to almost anything.""My takeaway is human adaptability to almost anything is just, like, much more remarkably strong than we realize,"" Altman said on the podcast. ""And you can get used to anything as the new normal, good or bad, pretty fast.""","Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, has been on a rollercoaster the last few years.
