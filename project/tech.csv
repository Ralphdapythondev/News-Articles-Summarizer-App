SpaceX and Elon Musk on the lawsuit

Lawsuit comes a day after WSJ's report claiming 'sexual misconduct'

There may be some trouble for SpaceX CEO Elon Musk . Eight former SpaceX engineers have reportedly filed a lawsuit against Musk on Wednesday (June 12), accusing the CEO of sexual harassment and retaliation. The same group of fired employees are said to have also filed complaints with the US National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) about SpaceX’s alleged retaliation. Bloomberg first reported on the lawsuit. The eight employees reportedly include four women and four men. The complaint targets both Musk and SpaceX.“Musk knowingly and purposefully created an unwelcome hostile work environment based upon his conduct of interjecting into the workplace vile sexual photographs, memes, and commentary that demeaned women and/or the LGBTQ+ community,” the eight former employees wrote in the filing. “It was also common for engineers to apply crude and demeaning names to products in an attempt at humor, often at the expense of women and LGBTQ+ individuals. For example, the name ‘Upskirt Camera’ was used for a camera on the first stage of the Falcon rocket that views the bottom of the second stage,” the filing further adds.According to a Bloomberg report, the filing further claims that the former SpaceX engineers that Musk made the decision to fire them in retaliation for the open letter that they wrote in 2022, highlighting Musk's ""problematic behavior"". The complaint claims that when a SpaceX HR official suggested that the company conduct a formal investigation before taking any decisive action, Musk replied, “I don’t care — fire them.”The open letter against Elon Musk is said to have been shared in an internal SpaceX Microsoft Teams channel with more than 2,600 employees. “Elon’s behavior in the public sphere is a frequent source of distraction and embarrassment for us, particularly in recent weeks,” the letter stated. “As our CEO and most prominent spokesperson, Elon is seen as the face of SpaceX — every Tweet that Elon sends is a de facto public statement by the company. It is critical to make clear to our teams and to our potential talent pool that his messaging does not reflect our work, our mission, or our values,” it further added.SpaceX and Elon Musk did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the lawsuit. SpaceX has previously denied wrongdoing and said that the fired employees violated policies. It also said Musk was not involved in their terminations.The lawsuit comes just a day after the Wall Street Journal reported allegations that Musk made sexual advances to women at SpaceX, including a former intern he had sex with. SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell was quoted in the story accusing the Journal of presenting “untruths, mischaracterizations, and revisionist history,” and saying “Elon is one of the best humans I know.”",Eight former SpaceX engineers have reportedly filed a lawsuit against Elon Musk.

"Pakistan installs 'China-like internet firewall' to regulate Facebook, WhatsApp, YouTube and other social media platforms",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/pakistan-installs-china-like-internet-firewall-to-regulate-facebook-whatsapp-youtube-and-other-social-media-platforms/articleshow/110948337.cms,"What is internet firewall in Pakistan aims to do

Pakistan is implementing a nationwide internet firewall system to monitor and regulate content on social media platforms like Facebook, YouTube, WhatsApp, and X (formerly Twitter), according to sources reported to be close to the development. Some say the internet firewall is akin to something that China has to monitor internet content in the country. This move follows the temporary blocking of X in Pakistan earlier this year. The stated goal is said to be to curb the spread of ""undesirable content,"" which includes propaganda and content deemed offensive by the Pakistani government.Pakistan's justification for blocking X centered on the platform's non-compliance with Pakistani laws and its alleged failure to register within the country. The government maintains that these actions do not violate fundamental rights.* Identify Propaganda: The firewall will reportedly use Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) technology to examine data packets and identify sources of propaganda material. DPI can inspect data up to the application layer, allowing for a more granular analysis of content.* Keyword Filtering: A key feature of the system is Keyword filtering is a key feature of the system. This aims to identify and block content deemed undesirable by the government, potentially including blasphemy, hate speech, or content critical of the state.* Limit VPN Use: The Pakistani government is also looking to regulate the use of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) which some users have employed to bypass restrictions on X. Initial attempts to restrict VPNs faced resistance from businesses, leading to a temporary suspension of those efforts.The temporary blocking of X in Pakistan has significantly reduced its user base in the country. The number of users dropped from 4.5 million to 2.4 million. This suggests that the government's actions can be effective in limiting access to certain platforms. Additionally, X's management appears to be more responsive to Pakistani government requests to take down content deemed problematic.","Pakistan is implementing a nationwide internet firewall system to monitor and regulate content on social media platforms.

What the CEO of Microsoft-owned GitHub has to say on the company laying off 80% of its employees in India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/what-the-ceo-of-microsoft-owned-github-has-to-say-on-the-company-laying-off-80-of-its-employees-in-india/articleshow/110948134.cms,"How AI will help Indian IT companies grow

Microsoft-owned developer platform GitHub has onboarded an additional 2.2 million developers in India, bringing the total number of Indian developers to 15.4 million. GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke who is in India spoke about a range of issues including the company's decision to terminate 80% of its workforce in India in 2023 as part of a reorganisation process.Dohmke told Economic Times that it was a challenging decision for the company due to economic circumstances, which affected certain segments of its team in India. ""We didn't make that decision lightly; it was based on the product areas these employees were working on, not because of India. Fortunately, the majority of these employees, originally from Microsoft, possessed skills that allowed Microsoft to rehire them, despite the process not being ideal. Nonetheless, we remain excited about India,"" Dohmke said.Nonetheless, GitHub remains enthusiastic about the opportunities in India, he added.Responding to the wide-ranging apprehension that Artificial Intelligence (AI) will pose challenges to Indian IT giants as businesses automate tasks that Indian companies have traditionally performed. Dohmke said that AI would lift Indian IT companies to the next level instead of disrupting them. ""We're dealing with an ever-growing amount of software in the system. No company I've encountered deletes more code than they write each day; the complexity keeps increasing,"" he said.""We're constantly maintaining and updating software, adapting to the latest technology. With AI systems , we're entering a new level of complexity, requiring even more software developers, especially in India,"" he said. The developer community in India on GitHub is projected to surpass that of the United States, which currently stands at 21 million, by 2027.“About 200,000 computer science graduates are coming out of engineering degrees, and that creates a convergence. India could be the leader, not only in software but also in AI. Children and adults alike will learn to code in their native language, leading to a prolonged groundswell of developers,” said Dohmke in an interview to TOI.",Microsoft-owned developer platform GitHub has onboarded an additional 2.2 million developers in India.

Google Meet add-ons on Android: How it will work



Google has announced that Meet add-ons will now be available on Android phones and tablets. The tech giant added this feature to the web version of the video conferencing platform which will allow users to install and use third and first-party apps directly from within the Meet app.In a blog post, the company confirmed that Google Meet add-ons on Android will be available to all Google Workspace customers .However, it will take up to two weeks to reach all users the company noted. Moreover, Google also said that “Scheduled Release domains” won’t get this feature until June 24-27.Android users will be able to find Meet add-ons in the Activities panel . This feature can be found along with features like polls and Q&A. However, it's important to note that desktop add-ons that won’t be available on mobile will be categorised as “Unavailable.”Google said that the visibility of all add-ons will be controlled by a dedicated setting, which will have separate toggles for the visibility of first-party and featured third-party add-ons.The company also confirmed that admins will be able to review their configuration by heading to Settings> Google Workspace>Apps in Google Meet’s video settings.It’s also important to note that the setting will handle add-on availability for both the desktop and Android apps.

Apple has launched this new app that may be 'terrible news' for LastPass and others,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-has-launched-this-new-app-that-may-be-terrible-news-for-lastpass-and-others/articleshow/110947747.cms,"Here's all that Apple has said about the Passwords app:

What makes the Apple Password app important

The rumors turned out to be true. Apple is finally launching a dedicated password manager app called Passwords. This app will be integrated across various Apple operating systems, including: iOS 18, MacOS Sequoia (the next major macOS version) and iPadOS (specific version not mentioned).Interestingly, the Passwords app will also be accessible on Windows through iCloud, allowing users to manage their passwords even on non-Apple devices. This is a significant move for Apple, considering the current reliance on third-party password managers like LastPass and 1Password . The new Passwords app will directly compete with established password management services like LastPass and 1Password.* Built on iCloud Keychain: The app leverages the existing iCloud Keychain technology, which already stores passwords on Apple devices.* Organization and Categorization: Passwords will be listed and categorized based on service type (e.g., banking, social media) for easier management.* Security and Convenience: The app will support secure logins through Face ID, Touch ID, and autofill features, eliminating the need to manually type passwords.While Apple offered password storage within Settings, it wasn't a dedicated app and lacked the features likely present in Passwords. This app seems particularly appealing for users heavily invested in the Apple ecosystem.Apple hasn't revealed if the Passwords app will be free or require a subscription. Overall, Apple's Passwords app presents a strong alternative to existing password managers, especially for Apple users. With its integration across various platforms and potential ease of use, Passwords could become a popular choice for managing login credentials securely.","Apple is launching a dedicated password manager app called Passwords.

Igniting your resolve in challenging roles as a woman leader,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/igniting-your-resolve-in-challenging-roles-as-a-woman-leader/articleshow/110947461.cms,"Lead with

confidence

and authenticity

Leverage the power of learning and feedback

Construct a personal ‘board of directors’

Reflecting on my path as a woman leader , resilience and tenacity stand out as guiding principles, especially when navigating what I term as ‘mountains’ — formidable challenges where the ascent is arduous and obstacles numerous. Yet, it's the innate capacity for optimism and resilience that sets women apart, enabling us to break through boundaries across diverse industries and geographies.While we’ve come a long way in breaking down stereotypes and biases, there’s still more to be done to ensure women thrive in leadership positions. Here are some of my learnings from accepting challenging roles and dealing with tough situations.Navigating challenging roles requires confidence, particularly as women ascend towards leadership. Confidence is cultivated gradually, amidst the twists and turns of a long journey, where unexpected hurdles may arise, and success isn't always immediately apparent. Women leaders must grant themselves the flexibility to forge their unique path, pausing to reflect and re-calibrate as needed, while steering clear of comparisons to stay on course.Authenticity also plays a pivotal role in bolstering confidence. By staying true to ourselves, we not only enhance trust in our own judgments and capabilities but also foster greater trust among team members.Learning plays an important part in owning challenging roles. Learning turns into growth, which turns into experiences, and experiences help create confidence. However, an important prerequisite to learning is curiosity. Curiosity is an attribute that can be useful in so many ways, particularly in terms of becoming informed and educated on aspects that we may not understand. These interactions not only broaden your knowledge and capabilities, but also expand your network of mentors and experts.Being open to feedback along the way facilitates a clear assessment of when to stand your ground and when to pivot; input from mentors and experts offers a fresh perspective for making necessary course corrections and charting the path to success.While learning and feedback are two sides of the same coin, owning your own perspective is critical. It is your confidence that allows you to choose the feedback that is relevant to your project or path. While experiences are shared, choose the learnings to take from them; it’s important not to compare your situation with someone else’s chapter.It's vital to remember that the path to effective leadership is not an individual one; it's a collaborative effort by everyone we work with and trust to help us progress. As a result, we must invest in curating a personal 'board of directors', which entails establishing and developing meaningful relationships with mentors who have diverse skills and abilities, as well as those who can pull us up from the top, cheer from the sidelines, or provide a boost when needed.By leading with confidence, embracing learning and feedback, and forming a network of trusted mentors, we empower ourselves to thrive in leadership roles and inspire others to do the same. Together, let us continue to inspire, strengthen, and uplift each other, forging a path of progress that knows no bounds. With every step forward, we redefine what it means to lead with grace, strength, and unwavering conviction.","Navigating challenging roles requires confidence, particularly as women ascend towards leadership.

How Microsoft may become a beneficiary of Apple Intelligence announcement

Apple , once again, has become the world's most valuable company, surpassing Microsoft as the competition for the top spot intensifies in the tech industry. The development follows the iPhone maker's announcement of AI features during its annual developer event, Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), earlier this week.Apple's market capitalisation reached $3.3 trillion by mid-morning on Wednesday (July 12), edging past Microsoft's $3.2 trillion. A positive reaction from the investors to Apple's extensive plans for AI integration across its devices pushed shares up over 7% to a record high on Tuesday (July 11).Apple announced plans to integrate generative AI technology across its built-in apps and new devices, offering features like writing assistance and AI-generated emoji, while keeping security as well as privacy at core.Microsoft captured the top spot and has held the title of most valuable company since early 2024. Additionally, Nvidia briefly surpassed Apple to become the second most valuable publicly traded US company.Meanwhile, a report by Kantar said that Apple has reached another milestone by becoming the first $1 trillion global brand. It is followed by Google and Microsoft in second and third spots, respectively.Earlier this year, Alphabet-owned Google also breached the $2 trillion market value mark for the first time since November 2021 after it announced Gemini aI features during its annual Google I/O 2024 conference.While this is good news for Apple, Microsoft may benefit from Apple's AI push. Apple announced the inclusion of OpenAI's large language models in its offerings, with plans for future models. Microsoft is a major investor in OpenAI and may see continued growth in its Azure cloud services due to increased use of OpenAI models.","Apple's market capitalisation reached $3.3 trillion by mid-morning on Wednesday (July 12) Apple is followed by Google and Microsoft in second and third spots, respectively.

In the ever-evolving world of social media, Instagram has emerged as a marketplace teeming with opportunities and risks alike. Amid the plethora of legitimate businesses, scams have proliferated, targeting unsuspecting consumers with fraudulent schemes. One such incident has recently come to light, involving a USA-based businesswoman who fell victim to an elaborate jewellery scam on Instagram.A man who issued a fake certificate of registration for selling hallmarked gold to a city jeweller was arrested on Thursday. The jewellers, Gorav Soni and Rajendra Soni, are currently on the run. The accused, identified as Nand Kishore, was apprehended after interrogation revealed his role in the scam. This arrest followed a complaint from Charish Nortez, a businesswoman from the USA, who purchased jewellery worth approximately Rs 6 crore, only to discover she had been duped.Additional Deputy Commissioner of Police (North), Bajrang Singh Shekhawat, who is leading the investigation, disclosed that Nortez had been conducting business with Jaipur-based jewellers Gorav Soni and his father Rajendra Soni for many years. The duo allegedly sold her 9-carat gold jewellery instead of the promised 14-carat gold, and moissanite stones in place of diamonds, which are approximately 50 times cheaper.The fraud came to light when Nortez had the jewellery tested during an exhibition in the USA and discovered the deception. She then travelled to Jaipur to confront the jewellers, who in turn filed a case against her at Manak Chowk police station in March 2023. The USA embassy intervened, prompting an investigation under the direction of the Jaipur commissioner.During the investigation, the hallmark certificates were scrutinised to verify the authenticity of the gold and diamond purity. It was revealed that the certificates were fake, leading to the arrest of Nand Kishore, who had issued them.""The hallmark certificates were found to be not authentic, and the person who issued them was arrested,"" said Singh.The jewellers, Gorav Soni and Rajendra Soni, are currently absconding. In India, a hallmarking licence is mandatory for manufacturing and selling gold. However, the investigation uncovered that many jewellers are circumventing this requirement by procuring fake certificates from laboratories, thereby misleading customers.This case highlights the ongoing issue of fraudulent practices in the jewellery industry and underscores the importance of verifying the authenticity of hallmark certificates when purchasing gold and diamond jewellery. Authorities are continuing their efforts to track down the absconding jewellers and prevent further instances of such scams.As social media platforms continue to grow as marketplaces, consumers are urged to exercise caution and due diligence to avoid falling prey to similar fraudulent schemes.","A man who issued a fake certificate of registration for selling hallmarked gold to a city jeweller was arrested on Thursday.

How Apple is trying to regain its position in China



Apple has achieved a new milestone in iPhone sales. As per data from Stocklytics.com (seen by Patently Apple), the Cupertino-based tech giant has about to reach the $2 trillion mark in iPhone's lifetime sales. This achievement comes after a recent decline in market share due to competition from Chinese brands like Xiaomi and Huawei.Since its introduction in 2007, this has been Apple’s most successful product as the company keeps updating its smartphones with new models and features.As per Statista data, Apple grossed $78.7 billion from iPhone sales within five years after releasing the first mode. Two years later, in FY 2014, this figure jumped to $101.9 billion and continued rising.The tech giant experienced several challenging years, especially in 2019 and 2020 when consumers worldwide reduced their spending budgets amid the pandemic. The report alsoclaims that iPhone sales have doubled and hit record highs in 2022 and 2023.During those two years, Apple grossed over $405 billion from selling iPhones, the highest figures in its history. Despite the revenue figures dropping slightly in the second quarter of FY 2024, iPhone sales remain strong. Statistics show Apple grossed $115.6 billion from iPhone sales in H1 FY 2024, pushing its lifetime revenue to a whopping $1.95 trillion.In Q1 FY 2009, Apple’s iPhone sales also accounted for about a quarter of Apple’s total revenue. Since then, this figure has more than doubled and hit 50.64% in Q1 2024.China is one of the biggest iPhone markets for Apple. According to a report by Counterpoint, Apple’s iPhone sales declined by more than 19% as Huawei saw 70% year-on-year growth in its smartphone sales in the country.To increase iPhone sales in China, Apple reportedly launched an aggressive discounting campaign on its official Tmall website in China in May. With these discounts, the company aims to fight off growing competition from local brands like Huawei. The latest discounts were steeper than those offered earlier this year.","Apple grossed $115.6 billion from iPhone sales in H1 FY 2024, pushing its lifetime revenue to a whopping $1.95 trillion.

The label uses stars to indicate the efficiency of a product, with more stars indicating higher efficiency. Simply put, the higher the energy efficiency rating of the appliance, the lower its energy consumption. To effectively reduce your home's energy costs, opt for appliances with a 5-star BEE rating. Not only does this positively impact the environment, but it also helps lower your electricity bills.
