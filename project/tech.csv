Tips to stay safe from

online investment scam

A couple from Indirapuram, Ghaziabad, has fallen victim to a cyber scam incurring a financial loss of Rs 3 crore. Nabanita Mishra filed a complaint with the local police, alleging that she and her husband were lured into a fake investment opportunity through a Facebook advertisement.According to the FIR, Nabanita Mishra and her husband Mrinal Mishra made 22 transactions amounting to Rs 3.1 crore to various bank accounts between July and August this year.The couple claims to have been lured into the scam through a Facebook advertisement. They were subsequently added to a WhatsApp group purportedly run by a popular investment platform. The group administrator encouraged members to participate in a competition called GTC, promising substantial returns.The couple claimed to have initially paid a monthly subscription of Rs 2,000 for investment advice. Subsequently, they were convinced to make multiple transactions for shares and IPO investments, with details provided by the company. The couple was also shown what appeared to be authentic SEBI registration details, adding credibility to the scam.The scammers operated through a WhatsApp group, where they shared details of transactions and apparent profits. The couple was even coerced into taking a loan of Rs 80 lakh, which they allegedly had to repay to the company to access their purported investments.Later, although she could view her investment details and profits in the company's app, she was unable to withdraw her money and was asked to pay taxes instead. Her suspicions grew when she tried to invest in IPOs through other platforms but was unable to do so. After investigating potential cyber fraud, she uncovered troubling information about the company. She attempted to contact all the numbers in the WhatsApp group, including those of other investors, but found them unreachable. The phone numbers were traced to Rajasthan.A case was registered under Section 66(D) of the IT Act and Section 318(4) (cheating) of BNS.- Ignore unsolicited investment advice: Scammers often reach out through emails, social media, or phone calls.- Verify the source: If you're contacted by an unknown person or company, independently verify their credentials.- Check for registration: Ensure the investment firm or advisor is registered with the appropriate regulatory authorities.- Understand the investment: Make sure you fully comprehend the investment product before committing.- Avoid sharing personal details: Be cautious about sharing sensitive information like your social security number, bank account details, or passwords.- High-pressure tactics: If you feel pressured to invest immediately, it's likely a scam.- Guaranteed returns: Be skeptical of promises of guaranteed high returns.","Couple from Indirapuram, Ghaziabad, has fallen victim to a cyber scam.

iPhones may replace this offside detection technology in English Premier League,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/iphones-may-replace-this-offside-detection-technology-in-english-premier-league/articleshow/112593413.cms,"How iPhones will track offside



.

“We are confident that by using the newest and most accurate technology available we will see the time taken for offside decisions reduced significantly alongside a consistent application of the offside lines,”

The English Premier League ( EPL ) is set to replace its existing offside detection system with a new technology centred around iPhones . The league aims to replace the existing and heavily criticised Video Assistant Referee (VAR) system with a more accurate and efficient solution.According to a report by Wired, the new system, codenamed “Dragon,” will utilise several iPhones placed around the pitch to capture high-frame-rate video footage .This video data will be processed by a software tool to determine the precise positions of players, enabling real-time offside decisions.The move comes as the league seeks to address the persistent issues associated with VAR, including delays and errors. The iPhone-based system promises to provide a more accurate and efficient method for enforcing the offside rule.As per the report, nearly 28 iPhones will be deployed in every Premier League stadium and will use the built-in cameras of the iPhone 14 and newer models.Each iPhone will be housed in waterproof enclosures containing up to four devices, along with fans and a power source, strategically positioned around the pitch.The system is designed to be scalable, allowing for the addition of more cameras if more detailed data from specific areas of the field is needed in the coming days.This setup enables the tracking of 7,000 to 10,000 points on each player during a match, a significant improvement over previous systems that could track 30 to 50 data points per player.Additionally, the system addresses the occlusion problem. In situations, when a player is partially obscured by others or by the stadium structure, the iPhones will capture up to 200 frames per second, far surpassing the 50 to 60 fps rates of traditional VAR broadcast cameras.Apart from identifying offside positions, the system is designed to predict potential offside situations, allowing for increased camera focus on critical moments.Leveraging machine learning and training on extensive soccer footage, the system will generate an automated offside call . However, final decisions will still rest with human referees.Rigorous testing, including validation by FIFA, has demonstrated the system's accuracy, but its implementation will be closely watched by fans given the challenges faced by the previous VAR systemsaid Premier League Chief Football Officer Tony Scholes said Wired.","The English Premier League is set to replace its existing offside detection system with a new technology centred around iPhones.

"Not Microsoft, Google or ChatGPT-maker OpenAI: Eric Schmidt sees this company as ‘big AI winner’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/not-microsoft-google-or-chatgpt-maker-openai-eric-schmidt-sees-this-company-as-big-ai-winner/articleshow/112589095.cms,"Tech giants making their own AI chips

Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt recently held a talk session at Stanford and told students that he believes the tech company that will be a winner in the era of AI will not be his former employer, Microsoft or ChatGPT-maker OpenAI but the one on which all these rely on.Schmidt said that big technology companies are planning for large investments into Nvidia-based AI data centres, which may cost as much as $300 billion to build.“I’m talking to the big companies, and the big companies are telling me they need $20 billion, $50 billion, $100 billion — very very hard,” said Schmidt, adding that he’s a “close friend” to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.“If $300 billion is all going to Nvidia , you know what to do in the stock market,” Schmidt said, adding, “That’s not a stock recommendation.”Schmidt’s indication that such a huge amount going to Nvidia – which makes the highly in-demand data centre AI chips H100 – will make it a winner. Notably, has already seen revenue increase by more than 200% for three straight quarters. And it even leapfrogged big companies in terms of valuation.“At the moment, the gap between the frontier models — there are only three — and everyone else appears to be getting larger,” Schmidt said.“Six months ago, I was convinced that the gap was getting smaller, so I invested lots of money in the little companies. Now I’m not so sure,” he added.In a bid to reduce their reliance on Nvidia, tech giants are developing their own chips. Google has developed chips called Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) to compete with Nvidia’s processors.Microsoft announced the Azure Maia 100 AI chip last year and it is designed to run cloud-based AI workloads. Meanwhile, Amazon is also preparing Trainium chips and Facebook-parent Meta revealed plans for ""Artemis,"" a second-generation Al chip surpassing their initial Meta Training and Inference Accelerator (MTIA) product launched last year.","Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt believes the tech company that will be a winner in the era of AI will not be his former employer, Microsoft or ChatGPT-maker OpenAI.

Warnings by Microsoft, Google and Meta

OpenAI , the company behind ChatGPT AI chatbot, has said that it has thwarted a covert influence operation orchestrated by Iranian hackers , who leveraged ChatGPT to manipulate public opinion. The campaign, dubbed Storm-2035 , aimed to spread disinformation and influence political discourse in the US and beyond.“This week we identified and took down a cluster of ChatGPT accounts that were generating content for a covert Iranian influence operation identified as Storm-2035.We have banned these accounts from using our services, and we continue to monitor for any further attempts to violate our policies,” OpenAI said.OpenAI says that the Iranian hacking group utilised ChatGPT to generate both long-form articles and short social media comments on a range of topics, including the US presidential election, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and social issues.It noted that these fabricated narratives were then disseminated across multiple platforms, including social media and fake news websites.“We identified a dozen accounts on X and one on Instagram involved in this operation. Some of the X accounts posed as progressives, and others as conservatives. They generated some of these comments by asking our models to rewrite comments posted by other social media users,” OpenAI said.The company says that its analysis revealed minimal engagement with the generated content, suggesting limited impact on public opinion.Recently, Microsoft and Google uncovered similar campaigns and published reports on how Iranian hackers are meddling with US Presidential elections . Both the tech giants revealed phishing campaigns and hacking attempts on several people of clout.Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump’s team also confirmed that his political campaign has been hit by hackers.Meanwhile, Facebook-parent company Meta said that Russian hackers are putting generative AI to work in online deception campaigns but the company has thwarted their attempts.","Iranian hackers used ChatGPT AI chatbot to target US Presidential elections.

Tensor G4, Gemini and more AI inside

Upgraded cameras with the new 'Add me' AI feature for photos

Google has launched its second-generation Pixel foldable phone, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold , which is its first-ever foldable phone in India. The second-gen Pixel Fold upgrades on some salient aspects over the first one. Per Google, the foldable is slim, super durable, and has a brighter screen, both on the outside and inside. And, the phone also packs in Pixel’s “fastest, most powerful” Tensor G4 chip , bringing on-device multimodal capabilities to the phone.On the inside, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold comes equipped with an 8 inches ‘Super Actua Flex display,’ an LTPO panel with a 2922x1344 resolution at 486 PPI. The inner screen has a dynamic refresh rate of 1-120Hz and can go as bright as 3,000 nits, which Google says is 80% brighter than the screen on the first-gen Pixel Fold. To make use of phone’s large inner canvas, there’s a split-screen mode that’ll let you use two apps side-by-side.When unfolded, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold can be used a regular phone with a 6.3 inches outer screen, which has the same specs as the inner screen.Google says that the Pixel 9 Pro Fold has an “all-new” hinge that is made from stainless steel and has an aerospace grade aluminium alloy cover. The hinge has a polished finish, while the back has the silky matt finish. The phone is rated IPX8 for water resistivity. And there’s Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the outside.Powering the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is Google’s Tensor G4 chip, also found on the other three Pixel 9 phones. The chip comes paired with 16GB of RAM and up to 1TB storage. Then, there’s theTitan M2 security coprocessor , which enables multi-layer hardware security.There’s a 5,060mAh battery, which Google promises will last for over 24 hours and up to 100 hours with Extreme Battery Saver. The phone supports fast charging at 45W, which should fill up the battery up to 55% in about 30 minutes. FYI, the charger isn’t included in the box. The phone also supports Qi wireless charging and Battery Share, i.e., reverse wireless charging.Out-of-the-box the Pixel 9 Pro Fold will come with Android 14 . There’s the usual Google promise of 7 years of OS and security updates.Would it even be a Pixel phone, if there’s no AI in it. Well, there’s a whole lot of AI. For starters Gemini is there, and it works in split-screen mode, as well. One could ask Gemini to write stuff or even get info about whats’s on the screen or photos. Circle To Search is also there, ohh and this feature can help you check if an image has been created using AI.The new “Pixel-exclusive” AI feature to arrive is Pixel Screenshots. The feature could organise or recall things, like events and location, all you need to is ask the phone.Google is giving one year of the Google One AI Premium plan for free to those who’ll buy the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. So, that’ll give you access to Gemini Advanced, Gemini in Gmail and Docs, on top of 2TB of cloud storage.The Pixel 9 Pro Fold ditches the camera visor for a squircle module that houses a triple lens setup – a 50MP wide camera, a 48MP ultraide and a 48MP 5x telephoto camera. For selfies, there's a 42 MP front-facing camera on the inner screen and 10MP camera on the outside.The camera hardware has been only a part of Pixel’s camera, but it’s AI that completes it. There’s a long list of AI features that complements the camera hardware on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. The usual Super Res Zoom, Zoom Enhance, Video Boost, Face Unblur, Photo Unblur, Best Take, Magic Eraser, Audio Eraser, and Magic Editor makes their return. Well, Magic Eraser now has an a “reimagine” feature that Google says can give photos a “whole new look.”One new AI tool to come to Google’s Pixel 9 pro Fold is the “Add Me,” which as you’d image can add you to a picture. So, how does it work? Well, you take photo with the group, swap in yourself, and AI will merge the photos.Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold is priced in India at Rs 1,72,999 and will be available for purchase later this year. While it comes in two colours – Obsidian and Porcelain – it’ll be available only in Obsidian colour in India.","Google has launched its second-generation Pixel foldable phone, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold.

"CrowdStrike sued by fliers after Microsoft outage disrupted air travel, company responds",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/crowdstrike-sued-by-fliers-after-microsoft-outage-disrupted-air-travel-company-responds/articleshow/112304684.cms,"What CrowdStrike says

Delta Airlines seeks compensation for disruption

In mounting problems for CrowdStrike over Microsoft outage last month, the cybersecurity company being sued by air travellers in a latest move. According to a Reuters report, air travellers whose flights were delayed or cancelled on July 19 due to Microsoft Windows outage on July 19 have filed a class action against the company.The plaintiffs include three fliers who filed the lawsuit in the federal court, Austin, Texas.They blame CrowdStrike's negligence in testing and deploying its software for the outage. Adding further, they stated that as fliers scrambled to get to their destinations, many spent hundreds of dollars on lodging, meals and alternative travel, while others missed work or suffered health problems from having to sleep on the airport floor.The filers demand CrowdStrike to pay compensatory and punitive damages to anyone whose flight was disrupted.In a statement, CrowdStrike said ""We believe this case lacks merit and we will vigorously defend the company."" The US cybersecurity company also provided an identical statement in response to a shareholder lawsuit filed on July 31.Delta claims that it faced over 2,200 flight cancellations on July 19 alone, with more than 6,000 flights cancelled since then. The airline is now dealing with over 176,000 refund or reimbursement requests. The estimated cost of the outages could reach as high as $500 million.The company’s CEO Ed Bastian said last week the outage had cost the airline $500 million, adding that it plans to take legal action to get compensation from the cybersecurity firm.Microsoft outage on July 19 was caused by a faulty software update that impacted 8 million Windows computers worldwide. CrowdStrike has rejected Delta Airlines' claim stating that it is ""highly disappointed by Delta's suggestion that CrowdStrike acted inappropriately and strongly rejects any allegation that it was grossly negligent or committed misconduct.""","Air travellers whose flights were delayed or cancelled on July 19 have filed a class action against CrowdStrike.

Social media outrage on Sarah Sarosh's GRWM video

Sarah Sarosh’s apology

In the age of social media, influencers wield significant power to shape public opinion. And with this power they also have responsibility not only to the brands they promote but also to their followers', many of whom may trust them blindly. It appears that Sarah Sarosh, a fashion influencer with over 200K followers, forgot this very responsibility.In what can be called a repulsive post, Sarah Sarosh posted a video on the heinous Kolkata murder-rape case where she can be seen smiling and applying make-up.In one-minute-four-second video, which has now been deleted, she is promoting makeup products that she seemingly is endorsing, while a commentary on the brutal rape and murder case runs in the background. The video, criticised for being insensitive and out-of-touch, sparked widespread outrage across various social media platforms. Despite issuing an apology, the incident has ignited a broader conversation about the appropriateness of using certain social media formats to discuss such grave issues.The video in question was part of a ""Get Ready With Me"" (GRWM) series, a popular format where influencers apply makeup while engaging in conversation. In this particular video , Sarah Sarosh appeared cheerful and upbeat as she applied serums, face creams, and makeup, all while a voiceover narrated the harrowing details of a recent crime in Kolkata. The stark contrast between the lighthearted makeup tutorial and the grave subject matter led to an immediate backlash.The video has left users across platforms like Reddit, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram shocked at her insensitivity. One Reddit user commented, “This is so distasteful and insensitive. She will do anything for views,” reflecting a common sentiment that the video was made purely for attention, without regard for the gravity of the topic.Another user questioned the decision to pair such serious content with a GRWM format, saying, “At this point, these people’s accounts should be banned. If she really had to talk about this topic, she could’ve sat down rather than doing a GRWM. How are the audio and video related?”On X, one of the users labelled the video “Absolutely disgusting,” while another user lamented the lengths some influencers will go for likes, stating, “Looks like there’s no end to how low they can go for likes. Nothing is off limits. No basic human decency is required.”In response to the backlash, Sarah Sarosh took to Instagram Stories to issue a public apology. She explained that her intent had been to raise awareness about the crime while also addressing her beauty content, which she had already filmed months earlier. “I posted a GRWM reel yesterday which was shot 2 months ago with a voiceover on the current affairs of the rape & murder incident,” she wrote. Sarosh admitted that she did not realise how “tone deaf” the video would appear, acknowledging that the mismatch between the content of the video and the subject of the voiceover was a grave error.Sarosh also shared her immediate reaction upon receiving negative comments, revealing that she deleted the video within five minutes of posting it. “The comments made me realise instantly that the messaging is distasteful from my end,” she said. “I deeply apologise for my actions to all those who have come across the content through screen recordings of my deleted content being circulated on other platforms.”","Sarah Sarosh, a fashion influencer with over 200K followers, posted a video on the heinous Kolkata murder-rape case where she can be seen smiling and applying make-up.

The new offering promises lightning-fast 8-16 minute deliveries for a diverse range of products, spanning from groceries to electronics.With this move, Flipkart directly challenges established players in the booming quick commerce sector, including Swiggy's Instamart, Zomato's Blinkit , Zepto , and BigBasket's BB Now.The service, which was previously offered on a trial basis to employees at Flipkart's headquarters, is now available to users through the Flipkart app.We confirmed the service's availability by checking an address in HSR on the Flipkart app, which indeed showed Flipkart Minutes as an option for quick delivery. Additionally, several users on X (formerly Twitter) reported that Flipkart is delivering groceries and other items to their addresses in Bengaluru within minutes through the ""Minutes"" service.Sources familiar with the matter tell the Economic Times that Flipkart plans to expand the service to more areas in Bengaluru over the next few weeks.The launch of Flipkart Minutes comes at a time when other players in the quick commerce space are aggressively expanding their operations.The ET had earlier reported that Flipkart was planning to operate around 100 dark stores to bolster its quick-commerce offerings during the upcoming festive season. Dark stores, which are mini warehouses strategically located for rapid deliveries, have become a crucial component of quick commerce operations.Blinkit, for instance, recently announced ambitious plans to increase its dark store count to 2,000 by 2026. This doubles down on its earlier announced plans to have 1,000 dark stores by March 2025. Similarly, Zepto aims to double its network to 700 dark stores by March 2025. Swiggy Instamart , another major player, currently operates more than 500 such warehouses.Interestingly, Amazon, a key player in the e-commerce space, has not shown interest in the quick-commerce business in India so far. However, it does operate a grocery store service dubbed "" Amazon Fresh ,"" offering same-day delivery for groceries. This is similar to what Flipkart has also been offering through its Grocery tab.","Flipkart has launched its quick commerce service'Flipkart Minutes'in select areas of Bengaluru.

California man credits Apple Watch for saving his life: ‘I wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for this little device’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/california-man-credits-apple-watch-for-saving-his-life-i-wouldnt-be-here-if-it-wasnt-for-this-little-device/articleshow/112306053.cms,"Apple Watch detects user’s low heart rate



What doctor said

An Apple Watch user is crediting the smartwatch for saving his life after the wearable alerted him about a life-threatening condition. Peter Moore , a resident of Montecito, California shared his experience with a local news publisher KTLA. Narrating the incident, he said “I wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for this little device”.Moore, who is a former tech executive, said that he was on his way to the airport when he began to feel “a little lightheaded and a little faint”.“Like a typical male, I thought, ‘I’ll go to Starbucks. That’ll fix it,'” Moore explained before he received a notification from the Apple Watch he was wearing.“My phone started to ping and said ‘low heart rate,’ which I’d never seen before. And so I looked at it… my heart rate had dropped to 32. And it was insistent in its notifications that something wasn’t right,” said Moore. He then contacted his wife who took him to hospital.“The doctor kind of theatrically ran in and said, ‘This is not good. This is not good. You need a pacemaker right now,'” Moore said.Omid Yousefian, the cardiac electrophysiologist at Sansum Clinic Cardiology who treated Moore said “Yes, his watch had a big role in saving his life”.“These days, 25% of the population over the age of 40 … have a high chance of experiencing atrial fibrillation,” Yousefian explained.“For us physicians, symptoms are the most important thing. [Moore] was notified by his watch that his heart rate is slow and he correlated that with the symptoms that he had. So he didn’t wait. He didn’t sit. He came to the hospital directly. So he made a very smart move,” Yousefian told the publication.","Peter Moore, a former tech executive, was on his way to the airport when he began to feel “a little lightheaded and a little faint” He received a notification from the Apple Watch he was wearing that his heart rate had dropped to 32.

What exactly happened

Read the complete post here

In a shocking incident, a Supreme Court lawyer, Mukul P Unny , was scammed out of Rs 38,000 while attempting to exchange his iPhone 13 for an iPhone 15 on Amazon .in. The lawyer detailed his ordeal on social media, highlighting the fraudulent tactics employed by the delivery executive.Unny took X (formerly known as Twitter) to post about the new kind of smartphone exchange scam.The incident occurred on July 21, 2024, when Unny placed an order for the iPhone 15 on Amazon. The following day, a delivery executive arrived at his residence and handed over the new phone after receiving the necessary OTP. However, the executive then requested another OTP, claiming it was required to complete the exchange.Despite Unny's hesitation, he was convinced to return the new iPhone to the delivery executive after speaking to the latter's supervisor.Unny contacted Amazon customer care the following day to report the incident. Initially, Amazon assured him of a refund if the product was not delivered. However, subsequent inquiries revealed the case was under investigation with a resolution deadline of July 31.On July 31st, Amazon concluded its investigation and informed Unny that a refund was impossible. The company's explanation lacked substance, as they had not thoroughly verified the scam details. The fact that Unny still possessed his old iPhone directly contradicted Amazon's claim that the exchange was complete.While Amazon has eventually issued a refund to Unny, his ordeal underscores the considerable risks inherent in online transactions, even when dealing with reputable platforms like Amazon.Always verify the identity of a delivery executive before sharing your Amazon OTP. This crucial step can protect you from falling victim to scams.“This is the story of my worst experience with @amazonIN On 21.07.2024, I ordered iPhone 15 from Amazon in exchange for my iPhone 13. On 22.07.2024, the delivery executive came at around 930 PM. I gave the OTP and took the product, and gave my phone to the executive.He said I have give another OTP. I had already given the OTP and was wondering what other OTP is to be given for exchange. I said I dont have any other OTP than the one I have given. He stayed there for few minutes & then called his supervisor.After speaking with the supervisor, the delivery exec asked for return of the product since the ""exchange is not final"".I insisted that I speak with the supervisor. The supervisor tells me that the exchange is done by a different team & requests for the product to be returned. I said I cannot give away the product especially since the OTP is given and the app was showing that the product is delivered. But this supervisor Ashok (8076650306) requested me to return, lest his team will have to make for the loss.Upon his request and assurance that the product will be ""reattempted"" the next day, I gave the product to the delivery exec (Vishal 8826421956) after taking the supervisor's and the delivery exec's number. On 23.07.2024, I spoke with the Amazon Customer Care and raised a complaint to which I assured that refund will be initiated if the product is not delivered. Call centre asked me to follow up on 25.07.2024.On 26.07.2024,when I called them, the customer case asked me to wait till 31.05.2024 as ""it has to be investigated"". Today, when I call Amazon, they said ""investigation"" is complete and that refund cannot be initiated. No fact-finding was done by Amazon in this. Now, we are staring at a loss of Rs. 38000 and a possible scam done by supervisor, delivery exec and others at Amazon. If they say that the exchange is done, then they can very well see the old phone that I still use with me.This could happen to any one of you and please be aware while dealing with @amazonIN.”","Supreme Court lawyer Mukul P Unny was scammed out of Rs 38,000 while attempting to exchange his iPhone 13 for an iPhone 15 on Amazon.in.
