How Apple may settle contactless payments inquiry with the EU,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-apple-may-settle-its-contactless-payments-inquiry-with-the-eu/articleshow/111093504.cms,"How this settlement will save Apple billions

What Apple has to say

Apple has reportedly reached a settlement with the European Union (EU) to avoid a hefty fine in an ongoing antitrust investigation, focused on Apple's mobile payment system, Apple Pay . The company is said to be making a series of concessions to allow rivals greater access to its contactless technology system.Citing three people familiar with the matter, The Financial Times reported that the regulators in the bloc have accepted a number of measures that Apple had committed to in January this year.The European Commission , the executive arm of the EU, charged the iPhone-maker in 2022 with breaking competition law, arguing that the tech company has been preventing competitors from accessing “tap-and-go” chips or near-field communication ( NFC ) to benefit its own Apple Pay system.The report said that Apple is still working to iron out the technical details but a settlement is likely in the next few weeks. The people, however, told the publication that the commission may still have issues with the commitments by the iPhone-maker and the timing of a settlement may shift.If the report is true, the agreement will help Apple avoid potential financial penalties, which is a fine. Under EU regulations, potential fines for antitrust violations can reach up to 10% of a company's global annual revenue. In Apple's case, this could have amounted to approximately $40 billion based on their 2023 revenue figures.Apple declined to comment but pointed to an earlier statement.“Through our ongoing discussions with the European Commission, we have offered commitments to provide third-party developers in the European Economic Area with an option that will enable their users to make NFC contactless payments from within their iOS apps, separate from Apple Pay and Apple Wallet,” that statement said.“Apple Pay will continue to be a broadly available option, and over 3,000 issuing banks across all EEA countries will still be able to offer the unparalleled privacy and security of Apple Pay, as well as its great user experience,” it added.","Apple has reportedly reached a settlement with the European Union (EU) to avoid a hefty fine in an ongoing antitrust investigation.

How government may solve 'Chinese visa' problem of PLI companies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-government-may-solve-chinese-visa-problem-of-pli-companies/articleshow/111093488.cms,"Restrictions on investment from China, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Bhutan, Nepal, Myanmar and Afghanistan

The Indian government is nearing completion of a streamlined visa process for Chinese experts needed by vendors in the PLI (Profit-Linked Investment) scheme, and plans to extend this to other manufacturing sectors. Delays in visa approvals for Chinese technicians, vital for machine installation, repairs, and training, have reportedly been raised by local manufacturers.According to a report in Economic Times, quoting an official, ""After formulating a standard operating procedure (SOP) for streamlining visa approvals for Chinese professionals whose expertise is required by vendors under the PLI scheme , the government is in the final stages to put in place similar processes for other manufacturing units.""""Most of the PLI (production-linked incentive scheme) visas have been taken care of. For general manufacturing also, we are trying to create a better streamlined SOP... that is with the Ministry of Home Affairs. It's at the final stages. We are hoping to sort it out. We have done a lot of sensitisation,"" the official added.The rollout of SOPs does not require any approval from the Union cabinet as it is an internal process to relax norms ""a bit"" for facilitating visa applications of Chinese professionals or technicians whose expertise is required by domestic manufacturing units, the official reportedly added.Industry representatives welcome the initiative, noting the affordability and necessity of Chinese expertise. The PLI scheme was announced in 2021 for 14 sectors, including telecommunication, white goods, textiles, manufacturing of medical devices, automobiles, speciality steel, food products, high-efficiency solar PV modules, advanced chemistry cell battery, drones, and pharma with an outlay of Rs 1.97 lakh crore. So far, Rs 9,700 crore has been disbursed to PLI beneficiaries. In 2023-24, the figure was Rs 6,800 crore, the official said.Under Press Note 3, issued by the ministry of commerce and industry, in the year 2020, the government has made prior approval mandatory for foreign investments from countries that share a land border with India. These countries are China, Bangladesh, Pakistan , Bhutan, Nepal, Myanmar and Afghanistan. Further, a citizen of Pakistan or an entity incorporated in Pakistan can invest, only under the Government route, in sectors/activities other than defence, space, atomic energy and sectors/activities prohibited for foreign investment.","Delays in visa approvals for Chinese technicians have reportedly been raised by local manufacturers.

Explained: Why European Commission has imposed anti-dumpling duty on 10 Indian optical fibre cable companies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/explained-why-european-commission-has-imposed-anti-dumpling-duty-on-10-indian-optical-fibre-cable-companies/articleshow/111093193.cms,"Why the anti-dumping duty on Indian OFC makers

Which all Indian companies are impacted

Impact on Indian OFC exporters

The European Commission (EC) is proposing anti-dumping duties on Indian optical fiber cable (OFC) manufacturers. This means that Indian companies exporting OFC to Europe could face additional duties ranging from 8.7% to 11.4%.The EC claims to have investigated Indian OFC manufacturers for six months, suspecting them of ""dumping."" Mahendra Nahata , managing director at HFCL, told Economic Times, “Dumping is established in two scenarios, one, when any producer is selling the exports below its cost of production or second, if it is selling at a price lower than the home country.” He added, “Both scenarios are detrimental trade practices and after a six-month long investigation, HFCL is the only producer which was found to be transparent in following fair business practices.”Several Indian companies, including Sterlite Technologies , Birla Cables , and Universal Cables, could face these duties. Also, other associated companies including ZTT India, UM Cables, Aksh Optifibre, Apar Industries, Polycab India and Aberdare Technologies could be hit by a penalty of 9.9%, according to an EC notification dated 14 June. However, HFCL, another major player, was found to be following fair trade practices and is exempt.The proposed duty is not final. The EC will hold consultations and legal proceedings over the next six months. Indian companies are expected to participate in this process. If implemented, the duties would increase the cost of Indian OFC exports, making them less competitive in the European market. This could potentially hurt Indian businesses and limit their reach in Europe.India exported nearly Rs 39,600 crore worth of OFC in 2024, with Europe being a major destination. This industry offers growth opportunities for Indian companies, especially considering the rising demand for fiber-optic infrastructure in Europe and the US.","European Commission is proposing anti-dumping duties on Indian optical fiber cable (OFC) manufacturers.

Nvidia beats Microsoft and Apple to become the world’s most valuable company,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-beats-microsoft-and-apple-to-become-the-worlds-most-valuable-company/articleshow/111093000.cms,"Apple vs Microsoft vs Nvidia: The market cap battle

What Nvidia becoming the world’s most valuable company means

Nvidia Corp's surge continues, propelling the chipmaker to the top of the global tech market capitalization leaderboard. The AI chip maker has beaten technology giants Apple and Microsoft to become the world's most-valuable company. This achievement underscores the dominance of artificial intelligence (AI) in investor focus.Shares climbed as high as 3.4% on Tuesday (June 18), pushing Nvidia's market cap past Microsoft and Apple, the current No. 1 and No. 2 companies. The top tech companies have been vying for the number one spot throughout June, with Nvidia ultimately edging out its rivals. Nvidia's ascent to the top has been record-breaking, driven by significant revenue growth fueled by AI. The company's share price has surged over 160% so far in 2024, adding more than $2 trillion to its market cap.Earlier this month, Nvidia surpassed Apple in market value for the first time in over two decades. Since then, the two companies have been in a back-and-forth battle for the top position. Last week, Apple briefly overtook Microsoft as the leader.According to Bloomberg, ""The ranking is yet another reminder that AI is the top focus of many investors. Nvidia is seen as the biggest and earliest beneficiary of the technology as it dominates the market with its highly sought-after chips that help power data centers running complex computing tasks required by AI applications. Demand for its H100 accelerators are surging and helped drive the chip maker's sales up by more than 125% last year.""This ranking shift highlights the paramount importance of AI for investors. Nvidia is widely seen as the frontrunner and biggest beneficiary AI technology going mainstream. The company holds a dominant market position with its sought-after chips.While Microsoft is also considered an early leader in AI due to its investment in and partnership with OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, Apple only recently unveiled its AI plans, leading to a recent stock rally that appeased investors.Analysts predict an intense competition between Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft for the first $4 trillion market cap in the tech sector, according to a note from Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives.Investors and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang believe the company transcends the label of a simple chipmaker.""They're not just selling chips, they're selling systems,"" stated Michael Lippert, vice president and portfolio manager at Baron Capital Inc, told Bloomberg. He emphasized Nvidia's proprietary software and development ecosystem as key differentiators."," AI chip maker has beaten technology giants Apple and Microsoft to become the world's most-valuable company.

WhatsApp may 'change' this media sharing setting and why it may not be good news for users,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/whatsapp-may-soon-allow-setting-hd-quality-as-default-for-media-sharing-and-why-it-may-not-be-good-news-for-users/articleshow/111090801.cms,"HD quality default setting for media sharing on WhatsApp: Availability



How this setting may not be good news for WhatsApp users



WhatsApp may soon change the way users share media on the platform. The Meta-owned messaging app is reportedly testing an HD quality default setting which can make high-resolution images and videos the new standard. With this option enabled, WhatsApp users won’t have to check whether they are sending media in HD or standard quality every time they share photos and videos.According to reports from Android Police and other beta users, the new default setting has been spotted in beta version 2.24.13.10 of the WhatsApp app on Android.This suggests that the feature is in its final stages of testing and could be released globally soon. Users can check if they have the option in the app's settings under Storage and Data> Media upload quality.While sharing media in HD resolution can preserve the quality of photos and videos, WhatsApp warns that these files can be much larger than standard ones. This means they might use more of your mobile data and take up more storage space on your phone and the recipient's device.Also, sharing long videos on WhatsApp can sometimes be a challenge. The platform itself has a maximum file size limit of 64MB for videos, which can be a hurdle if you're trying to send longer clips. Moreover, users with slower internet connections may even experience issues uploading or downloading large files.However, for those who prioritise high-resolution images and videos, the extra data and storage might be a worthwhile trade-off.The new default setting for HD photos and videos builds up on WhatsApp’s recent improvements. In August, the messaging app started allowing users to share HD images which was soon followed by HD video sharing. While not entirely uncompressed, the HD resolution significantly boosts quality compared to standard compression.Earlier, users resorted to workarounds like sending media as documents to avoid compression, which added unnecessary steps. However, this new default setting will eliminate that hassle and simplify the process of high-quality media sharing.",The new default setting has been spotted in beta version 2.24.13.10 of the WhatsApp app on Android. This suggests that the feature is in its final stages of testing and could be released globally soon.

"SIM swap scam: What is it, causes, signs, and tips for prevention",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-tips/sim-swap-scam-what-is-it-causes-signs-and-tips-for-prevention/articleshow/111082258.cms,"SIM swap scams causes

Social engineering: Scammers use various techniques to deceive victims and mobile carrier employees into believing they are the legitimate owner of the phone number. This can involve phishing emails, calls, or text messages to collect personal information.

Data breaches: Large-scale data breaches can provide scammers with the necessary information to impersonate victims. This data can include names, addresses, social security numbers, and phone numbers.

Insider threats: In some cases, scammers may bribe or coerce employees within mobile carrier companies to facilitate the SIM swap.

Weak security practices: Mobile carriers sometimes have insufficient security protocols for verifying identity before transferring a number to a new SIM, making it easier for scammers to execute their schemes.

Signs you might be a victim of a SIM swap scam

Sudden loss of service: If your phone suddenly loses service and displays ""No Service"" or ""Emergency Calls Only,"" it could be a sign that your number has been transferred to another SIM.

Inability to make calls or send texts: If you can no longer make calls or send texts, it might indicate that your SIM card has been deactivated.

Unusual account activity: You might receive notifications of unusual login attempts or password changes from your email, bank, or social media accounts.

Receiving messages about SIM card changes: If you receive notifications from your mobile carrier about SIM card changes that you did not initiate, this is a red flag.

Access denied to accounts: If you are suddenly unable to access your bank accounts, email, or social media accounts despite entering the correct passwords, it could be a result of a SIM swap.

How to protect yourself from SIM swap scams

Enhance account security: Use strong, unique passwords for all online accounts and change them regularly. Avoid using easily guessable information such as birthdays or common words.

Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): Use 2FA methods that do not rely on SMS-based codes. Consider using authenticator apps or hardware tokens instead.

Be wary of phishing attempts: Do not click on links or download attachments from unknown or suspicious emails and messages. Verify the sender's identity before responding.

Monitor your accounts: Regularly check your bank, email, and social media accounts for any suspicious activity. Set up alerts to notify you of any unauthorised transactions or changes.

Contact your mobile carrier: Ask your mobile carrier to add a PIN or password to your account for an extra layer of security. Some carriers also offer the option to disable remote SIM swapping entirely.

Use identity protection services: Consider using identity theft protection services that monitor your personal information and alert you to potential fraud.

Report suspicious activity: If you suspect you are a victim of a SIM swap scam, contact your mobile carrier immediately to restore your service and secure your accounts. Additionally, report the incident to your bank and other relevant institutions.

Unusual battery drain: A sudden and significant decrease in battery life can indicate that malicious software is running in the background, consuming power.

Overheating: While some heating is normal during heavy usage, consistent overheating can be a sign of malware or spyware running on your device.

Increased data usage: Unexpected spikes in data usage may indicate that your phone is sending information to a third party without your knowledge.

Strange activity: If you notice unusual activities such as apps opening on their own, text messages you didn't send, or calls you didn't make, your phone might be compromised.

Pop-ups and ads: An influx of pop-up ads, especially when not using a browser, can be a sign of adware infection.

Unrecognised apps: If you find apps installed that you don't remember downloading, it could be a sign of unauthorised access.

Slow performance: A sudden drop in your phone's performance speed can be a result of malware hogging resources.

Unusual charges on your bill: Unexpected charges for premium services or international calls might indicate that a hacker is exploiting your phone.

Immediate actions to take if your phone is hacked

Disconnect from the internet: The first step is to disconnect your phone from the internet to stop any data transfer. Turn off Wi-Fi and mobile data immediately.

Enable aeroplane mode: Switch your phone to aeroplane mode to cut off all communication signals, preventing further access by the hacker.

Check and remove suspicious apps: Go through your installed apps and delete any that seem suspicious or that you don’t remember installing.

Change passwords: Using another device, change the passwords for all your important accounts, including email, social media, and banking apps. Ensure that the new passwords are strong and unique.

Install and run security software: Install reputable mobile security software and run a full scan to detect and remove any malware or spyware.

Update your phone’s OS and apps: Ensure your phone’s operating system and apps are up-to-date. Updates often include security patches that fix vulnerabilities.

Factory reset: If the problem persists, consider performing a factory reset. This will erase all data and settings, returning your phone to its original state. Make sure to back up important data before doing this.

Contact your service provider: Inform your mobile service provider about the issue. They can provide assistance and may have additional security measures to help protect your account.

Monitor your accounts: Keep a close eye on your bank and other important accounts for any suspicious activity and report it immediately.

Preventative measures

Use strong, unique passwords: Ensure all your accounts are protected with strong, unique passwords. Consider using a password manager.

Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): Add an extra layer of security by enabling two-factor authentication on your accounts.

Be cautious with downloads: Only download apps from reputable sources like the official app stores and avoid clicking on suspicious links.

Regularly update your device: Keep your phone’s operating system and apps updated to protect against known vulnerabilities.

Install security software: Use mobile security software to protect against malware, spyware, and other threats.

Avoid public Wi-Fi: Public Wi-Fi networks can be insecure. Use a VPN if you need to access sensitive information over public Wi-Fi.

Version 9.4 of the app, which is currently rolling out via the Google Play Store, adds a Pro Lens selection mode and improves the HDR+ functionality on supported Pixel phones like the Pixel 6 Pro, Pixel 7 Pro, Pixel 8 Pro and Pixel Fold.One of the key additions in Pixel Camera 9.4 is the new Pro Lens selection feature. This allows users to manually choose between the ultra-wide, wide, and telephoto lenses on their device when taking a photo, rather than relying on the camera app to automatically select the appropriate lens. The Pro Lens option can be found under a new ""Pro"" tab in the camera settings.The update also brings improvements to HDR+ ( High Dynamic Range Plus ), Google's computational photography technology that combines multiple exposures to create images with better detail and dynamic range. Pixel Camera 9.4 enhances HDR+ with smarter automatic frame selection, favouring shots where subjects have their eyes open and are smiling.Additionally, the placement of the RAW/JPEG toggle has been moved from an obscure location in the settings to the more easily accessible Pro tab. However, unlike the Pixel 8 Pro, there is no option to adjust the image resolution.While the new version of Pixel Camera is currently available for download, users may not see the new features immediately after installing the update. The additional functionality is expected to be enabled via a server-side update from Google or with the release of the June Pixel Feature Drop .","Google has begun rolling out version 9.4 of its Pixel Camera app. It adds a Pro Lens selection mode and improves the HDR+ functionality on supported Pixel phones.

That’s why you have the embarrassing sight of billion dollar Gemini/ChatGPT many occasions spewing nonsense,” said Chandrasekhar.“Garbage in, Garbage out is an old adage in programming espclly if ur depending on scraping the internet,” he added.Chandrasekhar was reacting to Ethan Mollick, Associate Professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in the US, who posted that the idea that “LLMs bullshit - produce content without regard to truth - is not new”.“But I don't think it is that helpful a framework, since, in the end, LLMs may be more accurate than humans in many tasks,” the professor noted.Large language models, often abbreviated as LLMs, are the underlying technology that give AI chatbots their conversational abilities.LLMs are trained on huge amounts of text data, like books, articles and even code. This data can be vast, containing trillions of words – far more than any human may ever read. LLMs analyse this data and understand how language works, including the relationships between words and how they're used in different contexts.They rely on complex algorithms called neural networks – brains of AI models – mimicking how the human brain processes information. By making connections between different pieces of text data, the LLM learns to identify patterns and predict what words are likely to come next.

A US District Court has fined Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) a total of $194.2 million (roughly Rs 1,600 crore) on charges of alleged misappropriation of trade secrets. The order against TCS has been passed in a case filed by Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC), which has merged with DXC Technology Company (DXC), alleging misappropriation of its trade secrets before United States district court.TCS informed the court order to the Stock Exchange Board of India (SEBI) in a BSE filing. It added it will appeal against the court order and file a review petition. ""Pursuant to Regulation 30 of SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, we hereby inform you that the Company has received an adverse judgement passed by United States District Court, Northern District of Texas, Dallas Division, details of which are provided in Annexure A.""Giving details about the lawsuit filed by CSC, the BSE filing says, ""In a suit filed by Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC)/DXC Technology Company (DXC) against the Company, alleging misappropriation of its trade secrets:* The Court ordered that the Company is liable to CSC for $56,151,583 in compensatory damages and $ 112,303,166 in exemplary damages.• The Court also assessed that the Company is liable for $25,773,576.60 in prejudgment interest through June 13, 2024.• The Court also passed certain injunctions and other reliefs against the Company.“The court ordered that the company is liable to CSC for $56,151,583 in compensatory damages and $112,303,166 in exemplary damages,” the Mumbai-basedsoftware services company said in a regulatory filing.Responding to the court ruling, the Tata group company said that the judgement won’t have any major adverse impact on its financials and operations.

The suit accused TCS of exploiting the software access granted to 2,200 Transamerica employees, who were transferred to TCS, to learn about CSC’s software internals and create a rival insurance platform.

What is Apple Watch’s fall detection feature

Legendary director Steven Spielberg had a moment of onstage surprise during a recent Tribeca Film Festival talk. According to a report by Variety, his Apple Watch abruptly displayed a warning about a potential hard fall, causing a brief disruption.The incident occurred while Spielberg was discussing his early films. The Apple Watch's fall detection feature, designed to initiate emergency services after a tumble, mistakenly interpreted a movement as a fall. Spielberg, likely startled by the unexpected alert, reportedly removed the watch from his wrist.Unfortunately, this reaction triggered another failsafe. With no response from Spielberg to the on-screen prompt, the Apple Watch initiated an audible countdown before attempting an emergency call. However, Spielberg realised the situation and quickly silenced the alert before any unnecessary dispatch of emergency personnel.While such false alarms are uncommon with Apple Watches, they can occur at inconvenient times. The episode highlights the potential for these safety features to cause momentary confusion, especially when users are unaware of the proper response protocol.In this case, a simple press of the ""X"" on the watch screen would have dismissed the fall warning.Apple Watch's fall detection feature is designed to identify when you've taken a hard fall and potentially connect you with emergency services.“If Apple Watch SE, Apple Watch Series 4 or later, or Apple Watch Ultra or later detects a hard fall while you’re wearing your watch, it will tap you on the wrist, sound an alarm and display an alert. You can choose to contact the emergency services, or dismiss the alert by pressing the Digital Crown, tapping Close in the top left-hand corner or tapping “I'm OK”, said the company.","Apple Watch's fall detection feature is designed to identify when you've taken a hard fall and potentially connect you with emergency services.

However, new reports claim that it will arrive in 2025 with the iPhone 17 series.Mark Gurman , in its latest Power On newsletter, has revealed that Apple will be making an iPhone 17 with a slimmer overall chassis and this will be the thinnest-ever iPhone along with a slimmer version of MacBook Pro and Apple Watch.Apple plans to go “Slim” in 2025Based on the report, Apple is reportedly planning to go slim with almost every product it offers. An iPhone 17 Slim , MacBook Pro Slim, Apple Watch Slim and so on. While these names are just for reference, it will be worth the wait to see what nomenclature Apple choose for the upcoming devices with the thinner form factor.We also don’t know whether Apple will make an additional device alongside the regular iPhone, the Plus, Pro and Pro Max or it will give the slim treatment to just the Pro models like it has done with the new iPhone Pro devices.Apart from the usual upgrades like a new chipset, better display, batter and camera improvements, the major highlight will likely be the slimmer design of the iPhone 17. Additionally, we expect the phone to include existing and new AI features that the company announced atthe recently concluded Worldwide Developers Conference ( WWDC ), earlier this month.","Apple is reportedly planning to go slim with almost every product it offers.
