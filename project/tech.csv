Upskilling for the AI age

GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke strongly advises students to continue learning programming languages , even as AI systems become increasingly proficient in coding . In an interaction with Times of India during his recent visit to India, Dohmke addressed the debate over whether programming language education remains relevant in the age of AI.""Keep learning those languages,"" Dohmke unequivocally told TOI. He emphasised that understanding programming languages is crucial for developers, as code is fundamentally different from human language.Dohmke explained that while human language can be ambiguous, with the same sentence potentially having different meanings, programming languages are deterministic. ""The same line of code will do the same thing every single time,"" he said, highlighting the importance of mastering both human and programming languages.The GitHub CEO acknowledged that AI-powered tools like GitHub's Co-pilot are changing how developers work. These tools allow programmers to generate code by describing what they want to accomplish in plain language. However, Dohmke stressed that this doesn't diminish the value of understanding programming languages.To make the most of AI in coding, Dohmke recommends that developers upskill in prompt engineering . This involves learning how to refine queries to get desired outputs from AI models. He noted that AI models are ""probability machines"" that predict the next word or code, so understanding how to use them effectively is key.Dohmke also introduced Co-pilot Workspace, a new product featuring three AI agents to assist developers throughout the coding process. These agents help refine project ideas, determine necessary files, and implement tasks.While AI is transforming software development, Dohmke's message is clear: a strong foundation in programming languages remains essential for aspiring developers. By combining traditional coding skills with AI literacy, students can prepare themselves for the evolving landscape of software development.","GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke strongly advises students to continue learning programming languages.

"How CEO Satya Nadella may have been the key in solving Nvidia, Microsoft ‘AI chip feud’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-ceo-satya-nadella-may-have-been-the-key-in-solving-nvidia-microsoft-ai-chip-feud/articleshow/111195779.cms,"Why alleged tensions brewed between Microsoft, Nvidia

How this is a problem for Microsoft

Microsoft and Nvidia , beyond vying for the world's most valuable company title, have reportedly been clashing over AI chip design for months. The dispute eventually reached Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella , who intervened to resolve it.According to a report by The Information, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has tight control over how chips are allocated and installed by its clients, which include Microsoft.While the Nvidia CEO previously explained that the company dictates how chips are allocated to prevent companies from stockpiling them during periods of limited supply, this control reportedly caused a disagreement with Microsoft. Reportedly, these tensions have been building for some months behind the scenesAccording to a report, Nvidia's efforts to manage chip allocation extended beyond simply deciding who received the chips. The company reportedly attempted to dictate how these chips were installed within data centres, specifically focusing on the server rack configuration.This additional control over how Microsoft utilised the purchased hardware is what allegedly led to a feud between the two tech giants.The report further details that the disagreement escalated into a feud when Nvidia tried to convince Microsoft to adopt its next flagship chip, the GB200, within the server rack design specified by Nvidia.Installing the chips the way Nvidia wanted may reportedly have hindered Microsoft's ability to switch to different AI chips . Citing , citing people involved, the report said that when the dispute over server racks did not resolve for several weeks, it reached Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella's desk, the report said.Microsoft eventually won out as Nvidia backed down and agreed to the Big Tech company ’s demands, The Information reported.Reportedly, Nvidia CEO is worried whether companies like Microsoft and Amazon Web Services are going to run out of data centre space, which means a dearth of space will lead to less sales of AI chips.","Microsoft and Nvidia have reportedly been clashing over AI chip design for months.

How these activists used AI to ‘change’ the landmarks on Google Maps,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-these-activists-used-ai-to-change-the-landmarks-on-google-maps/articleshow/111196540.cms,"What Google said about the images



What the activists said about Google



Google has reportedly deleted dozens of images of Austrian landmarks from its popular maps service. According to a report by the news agency AFP, these altered pictures were uploaded on Google Maps by environmental activists from the country to highlight the potential impact of climate change.The report claims that the activists used artificial intelligence ( AI ) to change these images. The AI-generated pictures reportedly showed the river Danube and Austrian lakes dried up and snowless Alpine peaks as though the images were taken in the year 2070.These images were uploaded on Google Maps by the Austrian activist group Letzte Generation (Last Generation), the report added.Google said it removed the photos as they misrepresents a location.“Our policies clearly prohibit content that is not based on real experience or does not accurately represent a location. We are removing the policy-violating photos in question,” a Google spokesperson said in a statement to AFP.The group said that it was ""not very surprised"" by the company’s action.“They are ignoring the climate catastrophe, just like authorities and big companies in general,” Letzte Generation spokespersonMarina Hagen-Canaval said while talking about Google.The group also noted that this is not their first stunt. Earlier, it posted these pictures on Google Maps to alert tourists. With the stunt, the activists wanted to warn tourists who use the service to prepare for their holidays about the risks of rising temperatures caused by climate change.As per the report, Letzte Generation has staged other protest stunts. This includes blocking highways and has also promised to take more actions, including some on the internet.Apart from this, Google Maps is reportedly planning to remove its ""Followed Places"" feature next year. After 2o25, users will no longer be able to see or follow places within the app. This feature helped users to stay updated about their favourite local businesses and receive notifications about them. These updates include changes in business hours, special offers, or new menu items.","Google has reportedly deleted dozens of images of Austrian landmarks from its maps service.

While tech giants like Google and Microsoft-backed OpenAI are talking about artificial general intelligence (AGI) – an AI technology that is (at least) as smart as than humans, Softbank CEO Masayoshi Son says artificial super intelligence ( ASI ) will be 10,000 times smarter than humans and will be here in 10 years.In a rare public appearance, Son said that AGI is likely to be one that will be 10 times smarter than humans and will arrive in the next three-to-five years.But if AGI is not much smarter than humans, “then we don’t need to change the way of living, we don’t need to change the structure of human lifestyle,” Son said, as per CNBC.“But when it comes to ASI it’s a totally different story. [With] ASI, you will see a big improvement,” he added.According to Son, ASI is a higher degree of intelligence and in future various ASI models will interact with each other, like neurons in a human brain. This will lead to AI that is 10,000 times smarter than any human genius, Son added.“SoftBank Group has done many things until now that have all been a warm up for my great dream to realise artificial super intelligence,” Son told shareholders at the group's annual general meeting.This year, the company announced that it will step up its investments in AI companies.“From now on, we want to step up investments in AI companies,” said SoftBank chief financial officer Yoshimitsu Goto in May.“The reason we’ve been keeping our balance sheet at a very safe level is because we would like to be prepared, and we would like to be flexible if there is anything that we would like to move on,” he added.","Softbank CEO Masayoshi Son says artificial super intelligence ( ASI) will be 10,000 times smarter than humans and will be here in 10 years.

Several Paytm employees who have been laid off have reportedly filed complaints with the ministry of labour and employment alleging that the fintech company has made ""unlawful termination"" without proper compensation. The complaints, filed between June 1 and June 12, seek reinstatement.Moneycontrol said that it accessed a copy of the filed complaint on the ministry's Samandhan portal and the same has been also verified by an official.The complaints claim that the Paytm management conducted unfair and unethical termination practices.

While the report hasn’t revealed the exact number of complaints, some claim that it could be around 50.While some ex-employees said that they are waiting for a response from the ministry, a few others said that they were forced to resign.“We are awaiting a response from the Ministry and hope the case will be taken up by them. If not satisfactory, will take the court route,” said one of the employees, who claimed to have been terminated by Paytm without compensation or justification.Some employees have alleged being forced to ""voluntarily resign"".“My HRBP reached out to me yesterday (June 20) saying if I don’t resign by 12pm today (June 21), I will be terminated. I will take up the legal route as soon as possible. A few others are planning to do the same while some are already in the process,” another one said.In a letter to its shareholders last month, Paytm founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma acknowledged the company's first-ever sales decline. As per Sharma, the company is implementing cost-cutting measures targeting employee expenses, aiming to save Rs 400-500 crore annually.""One97 Communications Limited (OCL) is providing outplacement support to employees which have resigned as a part of the restructuring efforts by the company,” the company previously said.“As we harness AI capabilities and enhance governance structures, we are fully committed towards building our business according to regulatory compliances,” the Paytm letter added.Sharma also noted that the company will move forward with a “leaner organisation structure.” Apart from suggesting job cuts, Paytm also said that it will trim its non-core assets.","Several Paytm employees who have been laid off have reportedly filed complaints with the ministry of labour and employment.

Kaspersky ban in US comes into effect in July

The US government has banned the sale of Kaspersky antivirus software in the country citing security concerns. The ban will come into effect from next month. In addition, three units of Kaspersky will be added to a trade restriction list, which effectively bars a company's U.S. suppliers from selling to it. As per sources, the sale of white-labeled products - that integrate Kaspersky into software sold under a different brand name - will also be barred.Imposing the ‘first of its kind’ ban, the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security said that the software poses national security and privacy risks due to the company's Russian origins.“Russia has shown it has the capacity, and even more than that, the intent to exploit Russian companies like Kaspersky to collect and weaponize the personal information of Americans. And that’s why we are compelled to take the action that we’re taking today,” U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said.Kaspersky will be banned from selling its softwares in the US to individual customers as well as businesses starting July 20.Raimondo said that consumers who are already using Kaspersky's antivirus are not violating the law. Existing customers will be eligible for software and security updates till September 29, she stated.“That means your software and services will degrade. That’s why I strongly recommend that you immediately find an alternative to Kaspersky,” Raimpondo added.Trump administration banned Kaspersky from federal networksIn 2017, the then Trump administration banned Kaspersky’s flagship antivirus product from federal networks.

Melinda stepped from Gates foundation after the divorce

Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates divorced his ex-wife Melinda French Gates in 2021. Years later, Melinda French Gates has opened up about her divorce. In an interview with Time Magazine recently, she described the end of 27-years marriage as ‘a painful and horrible experience’.“Getting a divorce is a horrible thing. It’s just painful. It’s awful when you realize you need one,” she said. Although later she corrected horrible to hard, but added that things are wonderful now that it’s over.During the interview, Melinda Gates also talked about how getting divorced in a pandemic helped the couple get privacy. “It gave us the privacy to do what needed to be done in private,"" she told Time.She also reflected on being able to navigate the process while taking care of children. “You know, I separated first before I made the full decision about a divorce. And to be able to do that in private while I’m still trying to take care of the kids, while still making certain decisions about how you’re going to disentangle your life - thank God,"" she said.The divorce led her to step away from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in May this year, three years after the divorce. During the interview, she told Time that she thought about the effect of divorce on the foundation.""I thought a lot about my three children. But I certainly thought about the effect on the foundation. Those are the three biggest buckets: me, the kids, and the foundation. And I wanted to make sure that when we came through it to the other side - all of those pieces were intact.”Melinda also explained that she does not see her decision to exit the foundation as ‘downsizing’. “I don’t see it honestly as a downsizing ...I was just ready to be able to have full decision-making control about where all the funds go,” she said.","Melinda French Gates divorced her husband Bill Gates in 2021.

What the Apple Store will offer

Apple is all set to launch its first store in Malaysia , Apple The Exchange TRX, located in Kuala Lumpur 's Tun Razak Exchange business district. The yet-to-open store features a unique glass dome-like design.“Emitting a warm glow at night, the three-dimensional layered roof consists of horizontal glass panels and shading blades to reduce the sun’s rays. A central glazed oculus brings daylight into the interior and includes a dynamic artificial-lighting feature,” said the company.Inside the store, a sculptural quartz and glass staircase connects the three levels where customers can explore, learn, and shop. The Forum, home to Today at Apple programming, is located on a floating deck that joins up with the mall, while the upper level directly connects with the edge of the park, bringing daylight and greenery into the store through a continuous glass façade.The store runs on 100 percent renewable energy and is designed using high-quality materials, including natural stone walls, polished stainless-steel columns, light terrazzo floors, and a timber ceiling.Apple has announced that the store will open for customers on Saturday (June 22). “To celebrate the opening, a special Today at Apple series, “Jom Discover,” will run from Saturday, June 22, through Saturday, July 6. Bringing together some of Malaysia’s most celebrated creators, the sessions will offer a glimpse into the creative process while showcasing Apple’s full range of products and services,” said the company in a release.The Malaysian Apple Store has more than 160 employees and the customers will be able to shop for their favourite Apple products — from the iPhone 15 lineup to the MacBook Air with M3 and the latest iPad models, including the redesigned iPad Air and incredibly thin iPad Pro with M4.","Apple is all set to launch its first store in Malaysia, Apple The Exchange TRX, located in Kuala Lumpur's Tun Razak Exchange business district.

Ban on ChatGPT, which will be integrated in Apple devices

Ban on OpenAI’s ChatGPT in China

Private Cloud Compute

Apple has announced Apple Intelligence , a suite of AI features that will run on iPhones, iPads and Mac PCs. The AI features will be available later this year to users globally, including China – one the most critical markets for the company. However, the company’s big AI push may face some challenges in China as regulators have in place strict rules around the technology amid tough competition.The three challenges that the company may face in China are (via CNBC):China’s AI market is tightly regulated and all companies launching AI models must have approval from the regulators for the commercial use of LLMs. The country has also made it mandatory for Generative AI providers to take down “illegal” content.Since some of the features of Apple Intelligence are developed by the company itself, Apple will likely need to get its AI model approved by authorities under Chinese rules.China has also banned OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Some of Apple’s voice assistant Siri’s capabilities are dependent on ChatGPT. This could mean that Apple may have to find a local AI company that provides the same level of capabilities as ChatGPT. Baidu and Alibaba are among China’s technology giants that have their own LLMs and voice assistants.Apple's AI launch highlighted a focus on user privacy. Their new system, Private Cloud Compute, processes user data on Apple-owned servers, with the company claiming the data itself is not stored.However, in China, Apple's iCloud data is stored on servers located locally and operated by a third party. This may raise concerns about whether Apple can maintain complete control over its AI computing servers in the country.This means that Apple must have a similar partnership for its AI servers in the region to keep user data private.","Apple has announced Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI features that will run on iPhones, iPads and Mac PCs.

TCS sees headcount fall first time in 19 years

India's largest IT services company Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is facing a significant challenge filling a massive number of open positions. During a town hall earlier this month, the global operations head of TCS ' resource management group (RMG) Amar Shetye revealed that the company currently has thousands of open positions that it is not able to fill due to the skills gap.Shetye put the number at 80,000. For those unaware, the RMG team at TCS is responsible for allocation of available resources to various projects across the company and in case of any shortfall, fill such requirements through contractors. These contractors are on the roles of the hiring agencies and may or may not be hired as permanent staff by the company.The reason for the skills gap is said to be a mismatch between the skills possessed by employees and the roles in demand.An employee who attended the townhall anonymously told TOI, ""We were told that either skillsets or employee aspirations are not matching project requirements. However, at TCS, no associate is forced to take on a project if they are not comfortable with it."" Another employee on the bench added, ""He told us that we should consider ourselves fortunate that the firm is not laying off employees for not being mapped to any project unlike other firms."" The company’s recent annual report revealed that 33% of job requirements are currently being met by grooming existing talent.Post the announcement of fourth quarter results, TCS CEO K Krithivasan said that the company has built one of the largest artificial-intelligence-ready workforces in the world. ""TCS is currently working over 200 engagements in GenAI with our clients and foresees a promising pipeline of future work across all industries,"" he wrote.TCS posted strong performance in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 2024-25. ""This is a quarter of strong deals and execution for us. Continuous focus on operational excellence helped us achieve a 26% operating margin."" The management also said that deal wins were ""across markets, industries and geographies.""The Mumbai-headquartered company said that it had signed new deals totalling $13.2 billion in the fourth quarter, which is one of the highest ever for the company even as it signalled a cautious turnaround for the industry. The company added that the pain may be bottoming out and FY25 will be better than FY24.TCS's Gen-AI deal pipeline is said to have touched $900 million. “Our Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) pipeline has surged to $900 million, marking a doubling in value. The Total Contract Value (TCV) of the deal comprises primarily standard-sized deals, with the exception of a significant win secured in Q3,"" the company said in its earnings report.TCS' full year headcount fell for the first time in 19 years.

What is UPI Lite and why banks are pushing it

How to register for email to receive all the UPI transaction alerts



Starting June 25, HDFC Bank will stop sending text alerts for low-value UPI transactions. This means that HDFC Bank customers will receive SMS alerts for UPI transactions exceeding Rs 100 when sending money and similar notification for when received is above Rs 500. However, the bank will continue to send email alerts for all transactions with no absolutely change.In a mail as well as SMS alert sent to its customers, HDFC Bank said: “Starting from 25th June, 2024: Email Alerts: Continue to receive email alerts for all UPI transactions. SMS Notifications: Now only for transactions above Rs 100 (money sent/paid) and Rs 500 (money received).”This change aligns with banking norms, which require text messages for transactions over Rs 5,000. Despite this, many banks send alerts for lower-value debits as well. HDFC Bank stated that feedback indicated alerts for low-value transactions were deemed 'not useful,' as there is often duplication of notifications from UPI payment apps.Bankers noted that bulk text messages cost between Rs 0.01-0.03 each. With UPI transactions averaging around 40 crores per day, banks collectively spend several crores daily on text message alerts.Banks are also promoting the use of UPI Lite for transactions up to Rs 500. UPI Lite allows a small amount of money to be set aside by the app, facilitating quick payments without the need for second-factor authentication.By reducing the frequency of low-value transaction alerts, HDFC Bank and others aim to streamline notifications for customers while also cutting costs.
