"Why judge said ""jury no longer needed"" in Google anti-trust case filed in 2023",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-judge-said-jury-no-longer-needed-in-google-anti-trust-case-filed-in-2023/articleshow/110825005.cms,"What Google said to counter DoJ

In a surprising turn of events, a federal judge has ruled that Google 's antitrust trial over its alleged ad tech monopoly will proceed before a judge, not a jury. This decision by Judge Leonie Brinkema follows Google's payment of $2.3 million to the US Justice Department (DOJ), according to Bloomberg.The DOJ lawsuit, filed in 2023, accused Google of monopolizing the technology used to buy and sell online advertising. A key part of the government's case hinged on claiming they were overcharged for online ads. Traditionally, antitrust cases are heard by judges, but the DOJ opted for a jury trial in this instance.""A fair reading of the expert reports does not support"" a higher damage amount, Judge Brinkema stated, justifying her decision to remove the jury after receiving Google's $2.3 million cashier's check. This payment, tripling the estimated damages plus interest, satisfied any potential claims from the eight federal agencies involved.The DOJ argued Google's 20% fee for its advertising technology inflated ad costs. Experts estimated this resulted in an overpayment of around $750,000 for the government agencies. However, Google countered that the DOJ's damage claim was ""contrived"" and the company simply aimed to ""pick winners and losers"" in a competitive market.This is just one of several antitrust battles Google faces. A separate lawsuit regarding search market dominance is still awaiting a verdict, while a California jury previously ruled against Google in an Android app distribution case.With the jury request removed, the ad tech trial is now set to begin in September before Judge Brinkema. Google will have the opportunity to defend its practices in court.","A federal judge has ruled that Google's antitrust trial over its alleged ad tech monopoly will proceed before a judge.

Workers at Samsung Electronics, the world's largest memory chip maker , staged a one-day strike on Friday. The walkout , organised by the National Samsung Electronics Union (NSEU), marks the first time in the company's 55-year history that its employees have taken such action.The strike comes as Samsung struggles to regain its edge in the production of high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips, which are crucial components in artificial intelligence (AI) systems. The company has fallen behind its competitors, SK Hynix and Micron Technology, in supplying these chips to Nvidia , a major player in the AI processor market.The NSEU, which represents roughly 28,000 members or about one-fifth of Samsung's global workforce, called for the strike after multiple rounds of wage negotiations with the company broke down. Union representatives claim that workers received no bonuses last year and are seeking improvements to the performance-based bonus system and an extra day of annual leave.Samsung stated that there was no impact on production or business activities due to the strike, as it fell between a public holiday and the weekend. The company also noted that there were fewer employees on annual leave compared to the previous year.Industry analysts believe that while the one-day walkout is unlikely to immediately affect semiconductor production or shipments, it adds pressure on Samsung as it races to catch up in the AI chip market. The strike also signifies a growing assertiveness among the company's employees, who have only been able to organise unions in recent years due to Samsung's historical aversion to organised labour",Workers at Samsung Electronics staged a one-day strike on Friday.

iOS 18: The smartest iPhone update yet?

The AI features extend to other key apps too:

Safari web browser will offer more intelligent search results

Notes app will automatically generate summaries

Voice Memos will provide transcriptions

Messages will allow users to create custom AI-generated emoji

AI across the ecosystem: From iPadOS to visionOS

The secret weapon: A ChatGPT-supercharged Siri



An end coming to green-blue war: RCS Comes to iMessage

Hardware might take a back seat this year

Cupertino's AI coup

Apple 's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) kicks off June 10, and artificial intelligence is expected to take centre stage. And it’s the case of ‘it’s now or never.’ The word around the town is that the Cupertino giant will showcase how it plans to integrate AI (it would be the first of WWDC where we might hear the word “AI”) capabilities into its core products and services, including iPhones, as it races against the time.Apple will brand its AI efforts as "" Apple Intelligence "" and embed generative AI features across the iPhone, iPad, and Mac operating systems. Users will have to opt-in to access these AI tools, some of which might require an iPhone 15 Pro or later, or an M1 or newer chip on iPads and Macs. Apple is said to be taking a more practical approach to AI compared to competitors, focusing on subtle but useful enhancements to daily apps and tasks.The next major iPhone software update, iOS 18, is rumoured to be one of the biggest iOS releases ever, driven largely by AI. Siri will get a much-needed overhaul, gaining the ability to execute more complex tasks in apps like editing photos, deleting emails, and providing notification summaries.Apple is also said to be loosening the restrictions on the iPhone home screen layout, finally letting users place icons and widgets wherever they want. Rumours are rife that there’d be a new wallpaper pack that would be inspired of the older designs and slogans.In addition to iOS 18, expect AI upgrades in the latest versions of iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and visionOS for the Vision Pro headset. Core apps like Pages, Numbers, Keynote, and Xcode will gain AI-assisted features to boost productivity. Apple aims to showcase how AI can enhance the user experience in practical ways across its entire ecosystem.To accelerate its AI efforts, Apple has reportedly reached a deal with OpenAI to integrate the power of ChatGPT into iOS. Details of the partnership are expected to be announced at WWDC. This could help Apple catch up to Google and Microsoft who have already incorporated generative AI into their products.In a major shift, Apple is finally adopting Rich Communication Services or RCS in its Messages app. This will significantly improve texting between iPhones and Android phones, enabling typing indicators, high-quality media sharing, and end-to-end encryption. The move comes after pressure from the tech industry and regulators to make messaging more open and interoperable.While WWDC is primarily a software-focused event, Apple occasionally unveils new hardware products too, like the Vision Pro headset last year. However, no major hardware announcements are expected this time around, as Apple just updated its iPad lineup in May and new Macs are more likely in the fall timeframe.WWDC 2024 is shaping up to be a defining moment for Apple as it lays out its vision for the AI era. By carefully integrating machine intelligence in a way that upholds user privacy and focuses on everyday practicality, Apple hopes to make AI accessible and appealing to its ever-growing customer base.All eyes will be on CEO Tim Cook and the team on June 10 as they aim to make a compelling case for ""Apple Intelligence,"" which probably could be the next generation of Apple.","Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) kicks off June 10.

Why some artists are fleeing from Instagram for this new app,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-some-artists-are-fleeing-from-instagram-for-this-new-app/articleshow/110824127.cms,"Why artists are up in arm against Instagram

What is Cara app taking on Instagram

The Big difference between Cara app and Instagram

For years, artists of all stripes have relied on Instagram , a Meta-owned platform, to showcase their work and build their audience. Now, a growing number are leaving in protest of Meta 's policy of using publicly posted art to train its AI models.This discontent reportedly stems from two key events. First, a Meta executive declared public Instagram posts as part of their AI training data in May. Then, weeks later, European users received notifications that their content would be used for AI training starting June 26, with no opt-out option. While some regions, like the EU, offer avenues to dispute Meta's data use, artists feel increasingly powerless.Artists express a sense of being trapped. They rely on Meta's platforms for exposure but fear their work becoming fodder for AI that could potentially replace them. This isn't the first fight between creators and AI companies. Artists, along with authors and musicians, have filed lawsuits against companies like Google and Stability AI, arguing that their training data is scraped from the internet, potentially infringing copyrights. AI companies counter with ""fair use"" arguments, claiming their work is transformative.Faced with limited options, many artists are turning to untested alternatives. Cara, a free portfolio app launched in January 2023, has seen a surge in popularity despite experiencing growing pains. This artist-focused platform offers an Instagram-like interface but prohibits AI-generated art and uses detection technology to discourage scraping.Unlike Instagram, the Cara app specifically ""filters out generative AI images so that people who want to find authentic creatives and artwork can do so easily"". While Instagram requires AI content to be labelled, it is still permitted and promoted on the app.“We do not agree with generative AI tools in their current unethical form, and we won’t host AI-generated portfolios unless the rampant ethical and data privacy issues around datasets are resolved via regulation,” Cara’s website reads.Similarly, Cara app is not focused primarily on social networking but rather showing and sharing visual art.","Artists are leaving Instagram in protest of Meta's policy of using publicly posted art to train its AI models.

A man under investigation by the Indian stock market regulator, Securities and Exchange Board of India, for insider trading in Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) shares reportedly sent abusive responses. Rajat Mishra, the noticee in the matter, is said to have replied to Sebi in the offensive phrase --- ""Notice de rxxe ho ya bxxxk mxxxg rxxe ho."" SEBI subsequently fined the trader Rs 20 lakh.Earlier, according to a report in Economic Times, Mishra said that he would be available for video call anytime in response to the summons dated March 7. Hence, Sebi advised him to appear through a video call before the investigating authority from Common Investor Service Centre, Lucknow. However, the noticee failed to appear.Subsequently, Sebi sent another email on March 22 and Mishra was given another opportunity to appear before the investigating authority through a video call. In response to intimation given to appear before investigating authority, Mishra replied: ""Ek bxxp ki axxxd ho to axxxt kxxo"".After this email, Mishra reportedly sent more dismissive emails. Also, the information service centre, Lucknow, informed the regulator that Mishra did not come to their office. ""The failure to appear before the investigating authority by the noticee had hampered the investigation process and also that the reply to Sebi shows his callous attitude and complete disregard to the regulator,"" the order noted.SEBI is said to have issued show-cause notice to Mishra after noticing suspicious trading activity that suggested he profited from unpublished price-sensitive information (UPSI) on a planned stock split. The unpublished information period (UPSI) was between May 1, 2023, and June 8, 2023, when the company decided on a stock split but hadn't yet announced it publicly.SEBI investigated Mishra's trades between March 1 and August 10, 2023. This included the pre-UPSI period (March-April), the UPSI period (May-June), and the post-UPSI period (June-August).Trading records showed Mishra purchased a large number of shares during the UPSI period, sold very few during that time, and then sold the rest immediately after, when the stock price had risen significantly. SEBI says he earned nearly 29 lakh rupees by selling after the UPSI period.","Rajat Mishra, the noticee in the matter, is said to have replied to Sebi in the offensive phrase --- ""Notice de rxxe ho ya bxxxk mxxxg rxxE ho.""

The next-generation iPhones, likely to be called the iPhone 16 series, are expected to launch later this year in September with new features, changes and improvements.

This includes a bigger display, an improved camera and more. Here’s our speculation on how the two Pro models will differ.This one is a bit obvious. The iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max always had the screen size difference. This time around, however, the screen sizes are changing too. The iPhone 16 Pro is expected to feature a 6.3-inch display instead of 6.1-inch. And, the iPhone 16 Pro Max is rumoured to come with a 6.9-inch display which will make the iPhone 16 Pro Max to offer the biggest display ever on an iPhone.Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max with a slightly bigger display, is expected to come with a slightly taller design. However, the overall thickness of the phone is expected to remain unchanged. Also, the iPhone 16 Pro will be lighter compared to the iPhone 16 Pro Max.Apple is also expected to make certain changes to the camera setup of both iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max. Both the Pro models are expected to feature the updated 48MP ultra-wide sensor along with the 48MP main sensor. Additionally, Apple will update the telephoto lens from 3x to 5x (same as iPhone 16 Pro Max) on the iPhone 16 Pro models.The camera setup is expected to offer better low-light performance, dynamic range and several other improvements in terms of image quality.Apple iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max is also expected to come with improved battery capacity.

How Apple is trying to regain its position in China



Apple has achieved a new milestone in iPhone sales. As per data from Stocklytics.com (seen by Patently Apple), the Cupertino-based tech giant has about to reach the $2 trillion mark in iPhone's lifetime sales. This achievement comes after a recent decline in market share due to competition from Chinese brands like Xiaomi and Huawei.Since its introduction in 2007, this has been Apple’s most successful product as the company keeps updating its smartphones with new models and features.As per Statista data, Apple grossed $78.7 billion from iPhone sales within five years after releasing the first mode. Two years later, in FY 2014, this figure jumped to $101.9 billion and continued rising.The tech giant experienced several challenging years, especially in 2019 and 2020 when consumers worldwide reduced their spending budgets amid the pandemic. The report alsoclaims that iPhone sales have doubled and hit record highs in 2022 and 2023.During those two years, Apple grossed over $405 billion from selling iPhones, the highest figures in its history. Despite the revenue figures dropping slightly in the second quarter of FY 2024, iPhone sales remain strong. Statistics show Apple grossed $115.6 billion from iPhone sales in H1 FY 2024, pushing its lifetime revenue to a whopping $1.95 trillion.In Q1 FY 2009, Apple’s iPhone sales also accounted for about a quarter of Apple’s total revenue. Since then, this figure has more than doubled and hit 50.64% in Q1 2024.China is one of the biggest iPhone markets for Apple. According to a report by Counterpoint, Apple’s iPhone sales declined by more than 19% as Huawei saw 70% year-on-year growth in its smartphone sales in the country.To increase iPhone sales in China, Apple reportedly launched an aggressive discounting campaign on its official Tmall website in China in May. With these discounts, the company aims to fight off growing competition from local brands like Huawei. The latest discounts were steeper than those offered earlier this year.","Apple grossed $115.6 billion from iPhone sales in H1 FY 2024, pushing its lifetime revenue to a whopping $1.95 trillion.

During summer months, many households experience a significant increase in electricity consumption due to higher cooling needs. While staying comfortable during hot weather is essential, it doesn't have to come at the cost of soaring electricity bills. By implementing strategic energy-saving practices, you can reduce your summer electricity expenses without sacrificing comfort.Here you can explore several effective ways to save on summer electricity bills, offering practical tips and strategies that can help you minimise energy consumption and lower your utility costs during the warmer months. From optimising your cooling system to adopting energy-efficient habits, these recommendations are designed to make a noticeable impact on your electricity expenses while keeping your home cool and comfortable.Let's delve into these actionable tips that can help you save money and energy throughout the summer season.The Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) issues BEE Star Labels as a voluntary method for manufacturers to indicate an appliance's energy efficiency. The label uses stars to indicate the efficiency of a product, with more stars indicating higher efficiency. Simply put, the higher the energy efficiency rating of the appliance, the lower its energy consumption. To effectively reduce your home's energy costs, opt for appliances with a 5-star BEE rating. Not only does this positively impact the environment, but it also helps lower your electricity bills. Explore Crompton's wide range of 5-star rated ceiling fans to learn more about BEE Rating Appliances.If your home still uses CFLs and incandescent bulbs, it's time to replace them with LED bulbs. LED bulbs are not just a trendy choice; they are recognized for their energy efficiency and superior illumination. If you're wondering how to reduce your electricity bill at home, switching to LED bulbs is the solution for you.Upgrading to smart appliances is a highly effective method to decrease electricity consumption at home. These devices allow you to automate tasks and manage energy usage efficiently. Consider installing energy-efficient ceiling fans to further reduce electricity consumption. Smart appliances typically come equipped with remote control capabilities, allowing you to schedule operations and conserve power. Crompton offers remote-controlled fans designed for enhanced energy savings and lower power consumption.These energy-efficient fans are gaining popularity due to their brushless direct current motors (BLDC), which operate on direct current electricity. They can help save up to 60% on electricity compared to normal induction motor-based fans. Additionally, they offer convenient features like remote control for turning the fan on and off, timer functionality, and compatibility with voice assistants. To learn more about the differences between BLDC fans and normal fans and how they can help reduce electricity bills, explore further information on BLDC fans versus conventional fans.Implementing a full solar power system for your home can be a substantial investment. However, there are more accessible and cost-effective ways to leverage solar energy. Installing outdoor solar lights in your balcony and garden, along with solar fans, can notably reduce your energy expenses at a modest cost. Additionally, using solar pumps for daily tasks can contribute to electricity savings. It's beneficial to understand the distinction between an electric geyser and a solar geyser to make an informed choice for your energy needs.Maintain your air conditioner at 24 degrees Celsius to optimise cooling and conserve energy during the summer months, effectively lowering electricity costs. Additionally, using a timer to automate AC operation and upgrading to a 5-star BEE-rated model can further enhance energy efficiency and reduce expenses associated with cooling your space.Numerous advanced smart energy metres are currently offered in the market. These metres typically use Wi-Fi connectivity to monitor overall power usage within a home and provide real-time analysis of consumption patterns. Additionally, they can detect power leaks and identify high-energy-consuming appliances. Wi-Fi LED bulbs represent an excellent choice for reducing electricity usage.Regularly servicing and maintaining your home appliances is essential for optimal functionality and efficiency. Appliances that are not properly maintained are known to consume excessive energy, so routine maintenance can prolong their lifespan and reduce energy consumption. Learn more about the importance of cleaning exhaust fans.Install a power strip if you have several electronic devices or appliances that need to be plugged into a single electrical outlet. This allows you to easily turn off all devices at once when they are not in use, preventing unnecessary energy consumption often referred to as ""phantom"" energy loss.One of the simplest and most effective methods to lower electricity costs is by turning off electrical devices such as lights, fans, and air conditioners when they are not in use.","During summer months, many households experience a significant increase in electricity consumption due to higher cooling needs.
