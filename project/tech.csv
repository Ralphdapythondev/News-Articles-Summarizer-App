US Army makes a 'price request' to Microsoft for these Goggles,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/us-army-makes-a-price-request-to-microsoft-for-these-goggles/articleshow/114387663.cms,"What are Microsoft Goggles IVAS

$21.9 billion order in waiting for Microsoft

Microsoft's futuristic goggles designed for the US Army are reportedly facing a price challenge. According to a report in Bloomberg, ""The cost of Microsoft Corp.’s goggles for the US Army should “be substantially less than” than the projected $80,000 per set if they’re to generate large orders in the future, the service said.""Microsoft Goggles -- known as the Integrated Visual Augmentation System ( IVAS ) -- are based on Microsoft’s HoloLens “mixed reality” goggles.The Army has reportedly indicated that the current projected cost of $80,000 per set of Microsoft Goggles is too high to justify large-scale orders in the future.IVAS, which is based on Microsoft's HoloLens mixed reality technology, is intended to provide soldiers with a range of capabilities, including night vision, threat detection, and real-time information. The Army has been impressed with the device's performance, particularly compared to an earlier version that caused discomfort.However, the high price tag could affect the US Army's plans to purchase up to 121,000 units over a decade. The service has acknowledged that affordability is a key factor in determining whether to proceed with full production.The Army reportedly has planned to order as many as 121,000 of the devices contingent on results of an increasingly rigorous series of combat tests. The Army's decision on whether to move forward with full production will depend on the final cost and the results of ongoing testing, which includes a major combat exercise next year. If the Army commits to the project, Microsoft could potentially receive a contract worth billions of dollars. The report suggests that Microsoft could receive as much as $21.9 billion over a decade for the devices, spares and support services if all options are exercised.Testing to date “is going much better than the first time around” as “a lot of the problems have been fixed,” Army acquisition chief Doug Bush said this week at the annual Association of the US Army conference. “However — and this is important — we still have to be able get something that’s affordable” in order for the service to embrace full production rates.Microsoft on 'price cut' for the GogglesTo address the cost issue, Microsoft is exploring ways to reduce expenses in various areas, such as components, labor, and supply chain management. The company hopes to bring the unit cost down substantially from the current estimate.“We are going through the program to identify where we can reduce costs,” Robin Seiler, Microsoft’s corporate vice president for Mixed Reality, told reporters this week, as per the Bloomberg report.“It’s a fairly complex system, so when you look at cost reduction you have to look at it from a component level, from a labor level and from your supply chain,” Seiler said. Some of the cost projections are related to initial production batches and other projections are based “over time,” she reportedly said.","Microsoft's futuristic goggles designed for the US Army are reportedly facing a price challenge.

“As a result of DoD's unlawful and misguided decision to place and maintain. DJI on the CMC List, DJI has suffered significant and ongoing financial and reputational harm. Because of the CMC designation, which marks DJI as a national security threat, US and international customers have terminated existing contracts with DJI and refuse to enter into new ones. DJI and its employees now suffer frequent and pervasive stigmatisation. US employees of DJI have been repeatedly harassed and insulted in public places.”

DJI faces mounting pressure in the US



DJI has sued the US Defense Department (DoD) for listing it as a company allegedly linked to the Chinese military . The world’s largest drone maker has claimed that the designation is inaccurate and has caused substantial financial damages to the company. The lawsuit, filed in a US District Court in Washington, seeks the removal of DJI from the Pentagon's list of ""Chinese military companies” (CMC).DJI noted that it is ""neither owned nor controlled by the Chinese military"" and that the designation has resulted in lost business deals and reputational damage.Being on the list serves as a warning to US firms about potential national security risks associated with doing business with these companies. DJI alleges that the designation has led to contract terminations and a reluctance from customers to engage with the company.DJI, which sells over half of all commercial drones in the US, argues that the DoD's decision is ""unlawful and misguided"" and has significantly impacted its operations and financial standing.In the filing (seen by The Verge), DJI alleges:DJI is facing a lot of challenges in the US market. Earlier this week, the country’s Customs and Border Protection (CBP) started blocking imports of some of its drones, citing concerns about potential forced labour violations under the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act.DJI has already faced scrutiny from US lawmakers over data security and national security risks associated with its drones. The company has denied these allegations and has claimed that no forced labour is used in its manufacturing process.","DJI has sued the US Defense Department (DoD) for listing it as a company allegedly linked to the Chinese military.

Despite a seemingly strong partnership, OpenAI and Microsoft are reportedly engaged in intense negotiations to determine how Microsoft's substantial investment of nearly $13 billion will translate into equity as OpenAI transitions to a for-profit entity. This is said to have stemmed from one incident last year.According to a report by the New York Times, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella wanted to continue the investment but OpenAI CEO Sam Altman ’s sacking reportedly shook Microsoft's commitment to investing in the ChatGPT maker.“Nadella was initially willing to keep the cash spigot flowing. But after OpenAI’s board of directors briefly ousted Mr. Altman last November, Nadella and Microsoft reconsidered,” the report said, citing four people familiar with the talks.“Over the next few months, Microsoft wouldn’t budge as OpenAI, which expects to lose $5 billion this year, continued to ask for more money and more computing power to build and run its AI systems,” the report noted.OpenAI and Microsoft are in the midst of complex negotiations to finalise their partnership structure, with potential implications for the future of AI. The discussions centre around Microsoft's investment and its corresponding equity stake in OpenAI as the AI startup transitions to a for-profit model.However, the negotiations have hit a snag. Determining Microsoft's equity share and governance rights in the restructured OpenAI has proven challenging, particularly due to OpenAI's unique shift from a non-profit to a for-profit entity.Adding to the complexity, OpenAI aims to become a public-benefit corporation, balancing profit with social responsibility. This transition must be completed within two years to avoid potential investor backlash.Furthermore, recent reports have highlighted growing tensions in the Microsoft-OpenAI relationship. Financial pressures on OpenAI, coupled with Microsoft's increased caution following a brief leadership shakeup at OpenAI last year, have led to a more complex dynamic.",Microsoft and OpenAI are in the midst of complex negotiations to finalise their partnership structure.

Why Google is being penalised

A federal judge has granted Google a relief in its ongoing legal battle with Epic Games , temporarily halting a ruling that would have forced significant changes to the Google Play Store . However, Google is still required to comply with one aspect of the original order, according to a report.As per The Verge, starting November 1, the injunction on payment and revenue share is not stayed.The injunction reads:US District Judge James Donato granted Google's request to pause his October 7 injunction. The pause will remain in effect until the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals rules on Google's separate request for a longer stay during its appeal of the case.“We're pleased with the District Court's decision to temporarily pause the implementation of dangerous remedies demanded by Epic, as the Court of Appeal considers our request to further pause the remedies while we appeal,” a Google spokesperson said.Epic Games, maker of the popular game “Fortnite,” challenged Google's control over the Android app market. A December 2023 ruling that found Google guilty of illegally monopolising theAndroid app market could have significant financial implications for the tech giant.The initial injunction permitted alternative payment systems within apps, and stopped paying device makers to pre-install the Google Play Store. These changes could disrupt the Play Store's estimated $14.66 billion in annual revenue.Google argued that implementing these changes so quickly would introduce ""serious safety, security and privacy risks"" to Android users.","A federal judge has granted Google a relief in its ongoing legal battle with Epic Games.

Jio and Airtel wanted spectrum auction

Telecom Minister clarifies

Starlink CEO and X (previously Twitter) owner Elon Musk posted that Starlink ‘will do our best to serve the people of India’. Musk was responding to the announcement made by union telecom minister Jyotiradtiya Scindia that satcomm spectrum will be allocated administratively and not auctioned. “BREAKING: India’s government said it will allot spectrum for satellite broadband administratively and not via auction, hours after Elon Musk criticized the auction route being sought by billionaire Mukesh Ambani Good News for Starlink,” X user DogeDesinger wrote in a post.Replying to the post, Musk wrote “Much appreciated! We will do our best to serve the people of India with Starlink.”Earlier this week, both Jio and Airtel called for a revised approach to spectrum allocation for satellite communication companies in India. In a letter to the telecom minister, Jio emphasised that satellite companies should acquire spectrum through a transparent auction process, similar to traditional telecom players. Speaking at IMC 2024, Bharti Airtel Chairman Sunil Mittal favoured bidding for such allocation.Musk then termed their demand as ‘unprecedented’.Telecom Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia said on Tuesday that such airwaves will be given out through administrative allocation and not auctioned. ""Satellite spectrum across the world is allocated administratively. So, India is not doing anything different from the rest of the world. Conversely, if you do decide to auction it then you would be doing something, which is different from the rest of the world,"" the minister said.""That does not mean that spectrum does not come without a cost. What that cost is and what the formula of that cost is going to be, will not be decided by you or me ...it will be decided by Trai...and there is a paper that has already been circulated by Trai, and we have a regulatory authority for telecom, and that regulatory authority of telecom has been empowered by the constitution to decide what that administrative pricing is going to be,"" he said.","Telecom Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia said on Tuesday that such airwaves will be given out through administrative allocation and not auctioned.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/File Photo/File Photo

Intel is exploring stake sale in Altera, its programmable chip subsidiary . The chipmaker is aiming to sell a minority stake in Altera, sources familiar with the matter told CNBC. Quoting people with knowledge of the matter, the report said that Intel is seeking a deal that values Altera at around $17 billion.Intel has reportedly approached potential investors, including private equity firms, about acquiring a significant portion of the business, with the possibility of selling at least a minority stake.This move represents a dramatic shift for Intel, which acquired Altera for $16.7 billion in 2015. It comes as the company faces significant financial pressures , with its stock price down 50% this year amid fierce competition from rivals like Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices .The potential sale would mark a departure from Intel's previous stance on Altera. As recently as last month, CEO Pat Gelsinger had described the business as core to Intel's future. The company had earlier suggested it might monetize Altera through an IPO by 2026, but the current sale process indicates a more urgent need for capital.Intel's decision is part of a broader restructuring effort, which includes spinning off its foundry business as an independent subsidiary. The company reported a $1.6 billion loss in the first quarter of 2024 and announced 15,000 job cuts in August, underscoring its financial challenges.Despite these difficulties, Intel has secured a significant win for its newly independent foundry business, announcing a multibillion-dollar agreement withAmazon Web Services to produce an ""artificial intelligence fabric chip"" using its advanced 18A manufacturing process.The restructuring also involves pausing construction of new chip plants in Europe and reducing Intel's global real estate footprint. Bloomberg reports that CEO Gelsinger described these changes as ""the most significant transformation of Intel in over four decades.""Intel's strategic shifts have attracted attention from industry rivals. Arm reportedly approached Intel about acquiring its product division but was rebuffed, while Qualcomm has expressed interest in a potential takeover of Intel.","Intel is exploring stake sale in Altera, its programmable chip subsidiary. The chipmaker is seeking a deal that values Altera at around $17 billion. The move represents a dramatic shift for Intel, which acquired Altera for $16.7 billion in 2015.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114359880,imgsize-166326,width-400,resizemode-4/114359880.jpg"

Early Success

Pro Model Surge

Challenges Ahead

Long-Term Outlook

Apple's latest iPhone series, iPhone 16 , has good news for Apple in China . Bloomberg reports strong sales for Apple's newest iPhone in China, quoting research firm Counterpoint. Compared to the 2023 model, sales are up 20% in the first three weeks, according to Counterpoint Research data. This is a positive sign for Apple, after facing challenges in the crucial Chinese market last year.Though the smartphone market is stagnant, the iPhone remains Apple's most crucial product, generating roughly half of its sales.Strong iPhone sales in China are a positive indicator for Apple's overall performance.The iPhone 16's success can be attributed to several factors. A smooth production ramp-up, consistent pricing strategy, and existing user upgrades all contributed to ""substantial growth"" in China, said Counterpoint analyst Ivan Lam.Consumers are also gravitating towards pricier options, with sales of the top-tier Pro and Pro Max models jumping 44% compared to their predecessors.Despite the promising start, competition remains fierce. Local rivals like Vivo's X200 Pro, Huawei's upcoming Mate device, and updates from Xiaomi and Oppo threaten to steal market share. Additionally, the ongoing economic slowdown in China might lead some consumers to delay purchases until major shopping holidays like Singles' Day in November.While the iPhone 16 boasts AI features, the lack of a local partner for these features in China poses a potential hurdle. Analysts previously expressed concerns about this, as Beijing restricts foreign-developed AI models. Apple may need to collaborate with a Chinese company like Baidu to fully utilize these features in the region.While the initial response is positive, it remains to be seen how the iPhone 16 will fare throughout its lifespan. The success will depend on navigating intense competition and the ongoing economic climate in China.","Apple's latest iPhone series, iPhone 16, has good news for Apple in China.

Google Maps may move this weather feature on Android; here’s how it can change the map experience,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-maps-may-move-this-weather-feature-on-android-heres-how-it-can-change-the-map-experience/articleshow/114351227.cms,"Representative Image

How this move may alter the map viewing experience







Google Maps' India-centric features



Google Maps for Android is reportedly getting a more streamlined interface. The tech giant is testing a new design of its maps service by relocating the weather widget to the ""Latest in the area"" sheet that appears from the bottom of the screen. Previously displayed in the top-left corner, the weather information is now reportedly appearing in the top-right corner of this expandable sheet.According to a report by 9to5Google, this change aims to declutter the map view and provide Google Maps users with a cleaner and less obstructed experience.The report also includes screenshots to show when the ""Latest in the area"" sheet is minimised, the weather widget appears in the bottom-right corner, allowing users to quickly access information without hiding the map.The latest update follows another recent simplification effort by Google, where the app's bottom bar was reduced from five tabs to three.While this change aims to declutter the map view, it may make it slightly less convenient to quickly check the weather while exploring the map.Currently available in the beta version (11.151.x) of Google Maps, this update hides the weather information behind an extra tap. Users who prefer to see the temperature, conditions, and AQI at a glance may find this change less efficient.It remains to be seen whether this design will make its way to the stable release of Google Maps. Feedback from beta testers will likely play a role in Google's decision to roll out this change more broadly.In July, Google Maps added 6 new features which are designed specifically for Indian users . These features use AI and collaborations with local experts to address common challenges faced by commuters across the country.With these features, Indian users got access to AI-driven navigation that optimises routes, information on EV charging stations, and enhanced public transport options. Additionally, Google Maps also partnered with local guides to provide curated recommendations for places to visit and things to do.These updates reflect Google's commitment to tailoring its services to the specific needs of users in different regions. By incorporating AI and local expertise, Google Maps aims to provide a more seamless and informative navigation experience for commuters in India.","Google Maps for Android is reportedly getting a more streamlined interface.

Facebook firing staff over $25 meal credit misuse leaves employees divided,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/facebook-firing-staff-over-25-meal-credit-misuse-leaves-employees-divided/articleshow/114350959.cms,"What is Grubhub meal perk at Meta

What Meta employees said

Meta 's recent termination of employees for allegedly misusing meal credits has sparked mixed reactions among the company workers. While some express sympathy for those fired, others believe the dismissals were justified. The parent company of Facebook and Instagram reportedly terminated the employment of approximately two dozen employees for violating company policy regarding the use of $25 daily meal credits.According to a report by Business Insider, Meta employees took to the anonymous workplace forum Blind to discuss the recent firings related to meal credit misuse. A poll on the platform, which requires a company email for access, asked employees to respond with whether they were “Safe from Grubgate” or “Affected by Grubgate .”The Grubhub meal perk is essentially a $25 daily meal credit that is intended to benefit employees working late or in offices without cafeterias. A recent report suggested that this perk was misused by some staff members to purchase non-food items like laundry detergent and wine glasses.Learning upon this, the company terminated the employment of about a dozen staff. The Business Insider report says that Meta appears to have taken action only against those who repeatedly abused the system. Those who were found to have violated the rules occasionally were reprimanded but not terminated.“These fools are so lucky… at least they know WHY they got laid off. Imagine having to wonder for the rest of your life where you went wrong,” one wrote, as per the report by Business Insider.“This action instils fear in employees. Anyone can violate a policy by mistake. It's like taking away your driving licence because you were going 55 instead of 50. I challenge anyone to say that they know ALL the policies this company has,” one employee said.“It's not weird. They violated a 'follow this rule or you will be terminated' policy, and they were terminated. There is nothing to worry about unless you are also violating company policies. The rules you need to follow to keep your job are all written out for you. Read them,” another one noted.One Meta employee wrote on the forum that he/ she used their Grubhub credit for a laid-off worker and received a “warning email.”“My Grubhub account got deactivated first and then my intern account,” the employee said in the forum.“Although Meta still thinks itself a large company of small entrepreneurship, with the 'year(s) of efficiency,' it's starting to take policy noncompliance of employees more seriously,” another one wrote.""Should folks [have] done a better risk assessment for their $25 dinners? Likely. Should Meta have requested the employee refund the company, put a block on the benefit, and delivered a one-more-strike-of-any-kind-you-are-out warning?

The Karnataka government has introduced a new fee on transactions conducted through aggregator platforms like Zomato , Swiggy , Ola, Uber and others to fund social security measures for gig workers . The state government announced that the money collected will be used for the welfare of the gig workers.Karnataka Labour Minister Santosh Lad said, ""The Labour Department of Karnataka has decided to impose cess on every transaction on aggregators platforms like Zomato, Dunzo, Swiggy, Zepto , Ola and others such.The Money which will be collected will be used for the Welfare fund for Gig workers. We are not charging for products or goods which consumers purchase, wit will be charged only on transport.""Earlier today (October 18) it was reported by Moneycontrol.com that the state government is planning to levy welfare fee of 1-2 percent on Zomato, Swiggy, Zepto and other online platforms. The report said that the collected funds will be transferred to a dedicated welfare board to support gig workers engaged in delivery services.This fee will apply to all customers who transact on aggregator platforms, including Rapido, Dunzo, Zepto, Porter, Namma Yatri and others. So far there are no other details available about this Cess.The move comes in the wake of the government's draft Platform-Based Gig Workers (Social Security and Welfare) Bill, 2024, which aims to provide social security benefits to gig workers. The bill is expected to be presented in the state assembly during the winter session in December.While the fee will be collected by the aggregator platforms, it is very likely that will be ultimately be passed on to the customers, leading to a slight increase in the cost of services. This could potentially discourage frequent use of these platforms.The government has conducted extensive consultations with stakeholders, including aggregators, gig workers' unions, and industry associations, to finalize the details of the bill. Despite opposition from some aggregators, the government is determined to implement the fee to ensure adequate social security coverage for gig workers. Labour department officials said they conducted 32 rounds of meetings with stakeholders, including around 26 aggregators, gig workers' unions, civil society groups and lawyers. ""We also conducted inter-departmental discussions with the state Department of Information Technology and Biotechnology and organisations like NASSCOM (National Association of Software and Service Companies) and the CII (Confederation of Indian Industry).

How Netflix’s ban on password sharing and ad push has worked big time,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-netflixs-ban-on-password-sharing-and-ad-push-has-worked-big-time/articleshow/114349941.cms,"Netflix turns freeloaders to paying customers



Ad-supported tier gains traction

Netflix still recovering from the Hollywood strike

Netflix just wrapped up its third quarter earnings call, and it had Wall Street analysts on the edge of their seats. The streamer added around 5 million subscribers in the third quarter of 2024, bringing its total global count to 282.7 million. Approximately half of new sign-ups opted for the ad-supported plan , indicating that Netflix's recent strategies have started to pay off significantly.Ted Sarandos , Netflix's co-CEO, expressed satisfaction with the results during the earnings call. ""Our plan to reaccelerate our business has delivered,"" he stated. Netflix reported $9.83 billion in revenue and $2.91 billion in operating income.The crackdown on password sharing seemingly paid off big time, driving subscriber growth and revenue. Over the past year, the streaming giant implemented strict measures to prevent users from sharing their account credentials with individuals outside their household. This move, which initially faced some backlash from users, required people to either pay for their own subscription or add extra members to their account for an additional fee.While the company didn't provide specific numbers on how many of these new subscribers were former password sharers, the surge in overall subscriber growth suggests that the crackdown has effectively pushed many freeloaders to become legitimate users.The ad-supported tier, launched in late 2022, has also become a significant driver of growth. Netflix reported that ad-supported memberships increased by 35% quarter-over-quarter. The company also saw a 150% increase in upfront ad sales commitments compared to the previous year, indicating growing advertiser interest in the platform.Netflix says that it plans to test an in-house ad tech platform in Canada later this year, with plans for a wider rollout in 2025. This would give the streamer more control over its advertising ecosystem and potentially increase its ad revenue.Netflix's growth was particularly strong in the Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) region, as well as in Asia-Pacific. However, the company reported a slight decline in subscribers in Latin America, its first drop in the region since early 2023.Despite the positive financial results, Netflix acknowledged some challenges in its content pipeline. The company described its 2024 programming as ""patchier than normal"" due to the impact of last year's Hollywood strikes . However, Netflix assured investors that production has picked up again and expects programming to return to normal state next yearSome of the titles that raked in the highest viewerships in the Q3 included ""The Perfect Couple"" and a new season of ""Emily in Paris,"" which helped drive engagement. Netflix also teased a strong Q4 lineup, including the return of ""Squid Game.""Netflix says that the average subscriber spends two hours per day on the platform.In addition to its traditional streaming offerings, Netflix is making significant strides into live content. The streamer is expanding into live programming , with plans to stream WWE's ""Monday Night Raw"" next year and the upcoming Mike Tyson vs. Jake Paul boxing match.","Netflix added around 5 million subscribers in the third quarter of 2024.

'No regulation of WhatsApp, Telegram and others a big security risk'

Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), who members include Airtel Reliance Jio and Vodafone-Idea , have once again called for regulation of OTT apps including WhatsApp, Telegram, Google Meet and others.During the inaugural session of India Mobile Congress in New Delhi, COAI Director General SP Kochhar said that the government needs to implement stricter regulations governing the entry and exit of data from domestic telecom networks, including those used by Over-The-Top (OTT) platforms.He said that the government has to take lead in setting up standards for security and industry will support it.Kochhar highlighted the challenges posed by the unregulated nature of OTT platforms. He pointed out that while telecom operators are subject to stringent regulations, OTT apps like WhatsApp, Telegram, and Google Meet often operate with minimal oversight. This, he argued, increases the risk of fraudulent activities and compromises user security.To address these concerns, COAI has proposed that the government introduce comprehensive regulations to govern the operations of OTT platforms within India.
