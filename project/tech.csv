Tesla's one of the best quarter after a bug slump

Elon Musk's empire

Tesla CEO Elon Musk 's wealth skyrocketed by a staggering $26 billion on Thursday (October 25), propelled by a significant surge in Tesla's stock price. Tesla shares soared 22% as the company had its second-best day ever on the stock market, since 2013, following an earnings beat and an uplifting projection for 2025 growth.This latest windfall solidifies Musk's position as the world's richest person, with a net worth now estimated at around $269 billion. According to Forbes, this puts him more than $50 billion ahead of good friend and former Tesla board member Larry Ellison , who remains the largest shareholder in Oracle . Musk controls close to 13% of Tesla’s outstanding shares, accounting for the bulk of his net worth.The dramatic increase in Musk's wealth was triggered by Tesla's impressive quarterly earnings report, which surpassed analyst expectations. The company's strong performance, coupled with Musk's optimistic outlook for future growth, ignited a buying frenzy among investors. Tesla's stock soared 22% on the news, marking its second-largest one-day gain since its IPO.Prior to the earnings announcement, Tesla shares had been slumping and were headed for their worst month since January. But the stock erased its loss for the year and is now up 5% in 2024, compared to the Nasdaq’s 23% gain.Beyond Tesla, Musk's wealth is further bolstered by his substantial stakes in SpaceX , X (formerly Twitter), and xAI. His ambitious ventures into space exploration, social media, and artificial intelligence have significantly contributed to his overall net worth.While Musk's business endeavors have garnered significant attention, his recent political activism has also made headlines. His public support for Donald Trump and his involvement in political campaigns have raised concerns among some investors and analysts.The US Department of Justice has even issued a warning regarding Musk's voter sweepstakes, suggesting potential violations of federal election law. This legal scrutiny could have implications for Musk and his companies.","Tesla shares soared 22% as the company had its second-best day ever on the stock market, since 2013.

The domain was previously claimed to be bought by a Delhi app developer.

Here’s what the website reads

Welcome to Our Journey of Seva

Hello! We are Jainam and Jivika – siblings from Dubai, UAE, on a mission to make a difference. Even though we’re just kids, we believe that age is only a number when it comes to spreading kindness and positivity. Our recent journey began during our summer holidays when we left our home in Dubai for 50 unforgettable days in India. We had a purpose: to connect with children from various backgrounds, share our love for learning, teach skills for studying and setting goals, and inspire them to dream big.

Throughout our journey, we were met with inspiring moments and new friendships. We taught kids not only about studying but also about having the courage to set ambitious goals. Together, we laughed, learned, and grew, creating memories that we’ll treasure forever. This website is our way of sharing those memories with you – through photos, videos, and stories from our Seva journey. We hope it brings you closer to the incredible kids we met and encourages you to spread kindness in your own special way.

Along the way, people showed their appreciation through gifts, blessings, and even small donations, which we collected over our travels. When we returned to Dubai, we used a portion of this collection to support a young software developer from Delhi by purchasing this domain for his benefit. Through sharing our journey here, we aim to inspire others and keep the domain open for future sale to anyone who wants to continue this positive mission.

And one more thing – we love taking on new challenges! Make sure to watch our videos where we’ve shared some of these fun challenges, and we hope they inspire you to try something new too.

Thank you for being a part of our journey!

Best Regards,

Jainam & Jivika

Here's the previous letter that appeared on the domain webpage



Dear Executive of Reliance Industries,

I am an app developer based in Delhi, currently working on my startup. In early 2023, while scrolling through social media, I came across a news piece stating that Disney+ Hotstar was losing daily active users after losing the IPL streaming license, and Disney is considering selling or merging Hotstar with an Indian competitor.

This led me to hypothesize that, since Sony and Zee were pursuing their own merger, Viacom 18 (owned by Reliance) is the only major player with sufficient resources to acquire Disney+ Hotstar. This reminded me of when Jio acquired the music streaming service Saavn, they rebranded it to JioSaavn, and changed the domain from Saavn.com to JioSaavn.com.

I thought, ""If they acquire Hotstar, they might rename it to JioHotstar.com."" I checked for the domain, and it was available. I was excited, as I felt that if this happened, I could fund my goal of studying at Cambridge.

In 2021, I was working on a project that was selected for the Cambridge University Accelerate program. It was a transformational experience for me. I couldn't crack IIT and always wanted to learn from the best, coming from a Tier-ll college, being selected for this program was an incredibly valuable and practical experience. The startup program taught me many valuable lessons and provided insights into the ins and outs of startups for free, which was amazing. However, it was limited in scope - after all it was just a startup program.

Cambridge also offers a full degree program in entrepreneurship, which l've always dreamed of pursuing but could never afford, It's Cambridge, quite expensive. When I saw this domain become available, I felt things might just fall into place.

My intention of buying this domain was simple: if this merger happens, I might be able to fulfill my dream of studying at Cambridge

Now that the merger has actually happened, and news sources are confirming there will be only one site post-merger (either JioCinema or Hotstar.com), I believe JioHotstar.com would be a very fitting brand name for the merged entity. It maintains the brand equity of both brands and provides a rational transition for the current users of both sites.

To acquire this domain, kindly reach out to mail@jiohotstar.com from your company email address with an official letter attached, stating your authorization to purchase on behalf of Reliance Industries/Viacom18. For a multi-billion dollar company like Reliance, this will be a minor expense, but for me, the sale of this domain would be truly life-changing.

Best Regards,

A dreamer.

Reliance-Disney media company may come in November

In an unexpected turn of events, visitors to the JioHotstar domain (https://jiohotstar.com/) are now being redirected to a webpage featuring the story of two siblings from the United Arab Emirates who run an educational initiative for disadvantaged children. The website now reads “Hello! We are Jainam and Jivika – siblings from Dubai, UAE, on a mission to make a difference. Even though we’re just kids, we believe that age is only a number when it comes to spreading kindness and positivity. Our recent journey began during our summer holidays when we left our home in Dubai for 50 unforgettable days in India.”This comes after a Delhi-based app developer claimed to have purchased the domain earlier this week. The developer posted a letter on https://jiohotstar.com – asking the company to fund his higher studies in exchange for him giving up the domain. ""My intention of buying this domain was simple: if this merger happens, I might be able to fulfill my dream of studying at Cambridge,"" said the app developer.Times of India Tech checked the URL which now shows a letter from the Dubai siblings along with YouTube videos depicting their work.The merger between Reliance Industries Limited 's (RIL) Viacom18 and Walt Disney 's Star India is reportedly set to be officially concluded in early November after securing regulatory approvals in India. It is expected to create India's biggest and the most powerful media and entertainment conglomerate valued at $8.5 billion. As part of the merger deal, Viacom18 will transfer its assets to Star India, which will be the operating company post the merger.","Dubai siblings, Jainam and Jivika, embarked on a mission to teach disadvantaged children in India.

What the jury found

Apple has a ‘small’ win in its legal battle with medical device maker Masimo. A federal jury has ruled in favour of the iPhone maker in a patent infringement lawsuit against Masimo, awarding the tech giant a symbolic $250 in damages.According to a report by Bloomberg, the jury found that Masimo's original smartwatch designs and charger infringed on Apple Watch design patents, marking the latest development in a long-running legal battle between the two companies over smartwatch technology.The Apple attorney said that the company is not here for money but wants Masimo to stop copying its design.“We’re not here for the money. We want them to stop copying our design” and features,” Apple attorney said, lambasting Masimo for focusing on its innovations in pulse oximetry, the blood-oxygen measurement feature.An Apple spokesperson said that “teams at Apple worked for years to develop Apple Watch,” while “Masimo took shortcuts, launching a device that copies Apple Watch and infringes our intellectual property.”Masimo, on the other hand, celebrated the verdict as a victory, stating that the jury's focus on discontinued products undermines Apple's claims of irreparable harm.“Apple primarily sought an injunction against Masimo’s current products, and the jury’s verdict is a victory for Masimo on that issue,” Masimo’s statement said.The jury found that Masimo’s W1 smartwatch, Freedom smartwatch, and health module infringed on one patent, while Masimo’s charger infringed on another, as per the verdict form. The jury also found that Masimo’s infringement was willful.","A federal jury has ruled in favour of the iPhone maker in a patent infringement lawsuit against Masimo, awarding the tech giant a symbolic $250 in damages.

Tips to stay safe from task completion scam

Scrutinize offers: Be cautious of any offers that promise quick, easy money, especially those that involve simple tasks like liking videos.



Avoid unverified sources: Be skeptical of messages from unknown individuals or groups, especially those that contact you unsolicited.



Research the opportunity: Before engaging with any online opportunity, research the company or individual involved.



Check for red flags: Look for inconsistencies in the offer, such as unrealistic payment promises or pressure to act quickly.



Consult trusted sources: Seek advice from friends, family, or cybersecurity experts if you have doubts about an offer.



Avoid sharing sensitive data: Never share personal information like bank details, passwords, or OTPs with anyone online, especially if you don't know them personally.



Be mindful of phishing attempts: Be wary of emails, messages, or links that ask for your personal information.

A bookstore owner in Puttur, Mangaluru , has become the victim of a large-scale online scam , losing Rs 56.7 lakh in a deceptive YouTube video liking scheme.As reported by The Hindu, the victim, a 57-year-old man, reportedly received a WhatsApp message on October 10th offering a part-time job involving liking YouTube videos for a high return. Enticed by the prospect of easy money, he followed the instructions provided by the scammers. These included subscribing to a YouTube channel and sending screenshots as proof.Initially, the victim received small payments of Rs 123 and Rs 492 for completing simple tasks on YouTube. Encouraged by these quick returns, the victim was then lured into a more complex scheme. He was added to a Telegram group where he was instructed to deposit money in exchange for higher commissions. The victim, still believing in the legitimacy of the scheme, invested a significant sum, including money borrowed from friends, into various bank accounts provided by the scammers.Despite initial small returns, the victim eventually received no further money after transferring a staggering amount of Rs 56.7 lakh.

Reliance enters in partnership with Nvidia

The 2024 Nvidia AI Summit in Mumbai saw Bollywood superstar Akshay Kumar rubbing shoulders with Jensen Huang , CEO of AI giant Nvidia. While the summit focused on strengthening India's AI capabilities, their encounter ended with a surprising discussion – martial arts.Kumar, a known martial arts enthusiast, shared a photo on social media X, formerly known as Twitter, where he and Huang pose playfully in a fighting stance. The caption reads: ""Imagine meeting the world’s biggest authority on Artificial Intelligence and ending up chatting about martial arts!! What an amazing man you are Mr. #JensenHuang. Now I know why @nvidia is the absolute giant that it is. 😊👍🏻""Nvidia's leather-jacket-clad CEO Huang got a rock star welcome at the company's AI summit in India. As a Bloomberg report said, ""The reception Huang received in India's commercial capital Mumbai was reminiscent of the ""Jensanity"" seen in other parts of the world, especially Taiwan, as his popularity climbs with Nvidia's soaring earnings and multi-trillion dollar market valuation.""Huang praised India's rapid digitalisation and its potential in the AI sector. ""Very few countries have this amazing natural resource called IT and computer science expertise,"" he said.The event, where the U.S. company unveiled plans to supply Reliance Industries and other Indian firms with its AI chips, had to be reportedly delayed for more than half an hour due to the crowd that one Nvidia employee said was ""easily a few thousand"".Nvidia CEO Huang and Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani announced a strategic partnership to build state-of-the-art AI infrastructure in India at the summit. The collaboration aims to accelerate India's transformation into a global AI powerhouse by leveraging the nation's vast talent pool and burgeoning digital infrastructure. ""We are among the only countries where the average age of 1.4 billion people is below 35,"" he noted. Ambani emphasised that India's aspirations, combined with the visionary leadership of the Indian Prime Minister, have set the stage for a digital revolution. ""We are at the doorstep of the new intelligence age,"" he said.","Jensen Huang, CEO of AI giant Nvidia, met Bollywood superstar Akshay Kumar at the 2024 Nvidia AI Summit in Mumbai.

Industrial conglomerate Siemens AG is reportedly exploring a potential acquisition of Altair Engineering Inc, a leading provider of engineering software . According to a report in Bloomberg, quoting sources familiar with the matter, this move, if finalized, would mark one of Siemens' largest acquisitions to date.The report said that Siemens has been actively working with advisors to assess the feasibility of acquiring Altair, which is headquartered in Troy, Michigan. Altair's stock has seen a significant surge of 27% this year, valuing the company at approximately $9.1 billion. The company has been considering a sale, and Reuters recently reported that Altair was exploring such a move.While discussions are ongoing, there's no guarantee that Siemens will ultimately decide to proceed with the acquisition. Other potential bidders could also emerge for Altair. Representatives from both companies have declined to comment on the matter.Founded by James Scapa, Altair offers a wide range of engineering software solutions to companies across various industries, including aerospace, automotive, energy, and financial services. The growing demand for such tools, driven by the increasing adoption of artificial intelligence, makes Altair a particularly attractive target for Siemens.Under the leadership of CEO Roland Busch , Siemens has been strategically shifting its focus away from heavy equipment businesses and towards higher-margin, software-driven product lines. This strategic shift aligns with the company's aim to catch up to its competitors in the automation industry, such as Rockwell Automation and Schneider Electric.The potential acquisition of Altair would further strengthen Siemens' position in the software market and enhance its capabilities in providing comprehensive engineering solutions to its customers.","Siemens AG is reportedly exploring a potential acquisition of Altair Engineering Inc.

Tech CEO in memo calling employees back to office: “We will stop the insanity of people working remotely…”,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/tech-ceo-in-memo-calling-employees-back-to-office-we-will-stop-the-insanity-of-people-working-remotely/articleshow/114617110.cms,"Read Bolt CEO's full memo to staff:

Following up from the All-hands on Tuesday I'll explain my thinking about the new Return to Office & Location policy and your role as a manager in supporting this transition.

The summary is that I deeply believe that we work better in person, not remotely.

The longer version is that we have a choice to make as a company. Either we restart our ambitious culture to compete in the highest league or we fall into mediocrity. Even the largest companies from Amazon to Tesla to Apple realise that in order to stay at the top they have to retain an intense culture and have got people back to office 3-5 days a week. We are a tiny company in comparison and to ever reach that scale we have to work harder and innovate more than them.

We have seen too much complacency in the last few years on how we recruit, where people live and when and where people work. We are too scattered, people feel disconnected, attrition is too high, and our offices lie empty. I find it a disgrace to our culture that less than 50% of employees come to the office +2 days per week.

We will return to being a high performance organisation from 1st of January:

Mandatory 12 days a month in office for all employees.

Min 2 days a week. Team leaders have the authority to do more – many sales teams do 5 already.

We have invested millions into having fantastic offices already, but in sites with lack of space we will set designated days per team to divide nicely.

Relative to the top

tech companies

we believe this is generous and allows plenty of flexibility to employees.

We will stop the insanity of people working remotely from places like Bali. That is a vacation not what we hired them to do.

Reducing the number of sites to 2 for global roles.

By default every department will have 2 hubs – Tallinn first and by default London secondary.

Some large departments like tech retain more. If you have questions, ask your department head.

In order for people to get the most value of being in office their team needs to be there. Some departments have scattered teams and we will consolidate that.

To be clear this refers to global roles, not local or regional.

There are 5 benefits to working in person:

Raise the performance bar. We see a strong correlation between office attendance vs performance and engagement.

Improve collaboration. Having meetings in person is more effective than video calls.

Improve relationships in and between teams. Interacting with people in person is better for solving conflict and building positive relations. Video calls are transactional, while having coffee or lunch together is infinitely better for relationship building.

Better information flow and idea generation. Having informal chats in the office is impossible to replicate remotely.

Improve mental wellbeing. Having positive in person interactions is a huge benefit for stress.

As managers I ask you to help me with this:

Sell this message to your teams.

Lead by example by being present in the office more often starting from next week.

Create an environment where your teams want to come into the office. It should be engaging and fun to work in person, not a chore.

Monitor and manage poor attendance. We are absolutely fine if some people decide this is not for them, as the cultural impact far outweighs it.

The culture at Bolt is unique and we need to work every day to retain it. I cannot do that alone – we all have to take accountability for making this a fantastic place to work, where people come to do the best work of their lives.

The CEO of Bolt , a European ride-hailing and delivery app that directly competes with Uber, has taken a strong stance on remote work . CEO Markus Villig called low office attendance a “disgrace” and asked employees to return to office for 12 days a month – which roughly translates to 3-days-a-week starting in January.According to a report by Business Insider, Villig criticised the “insanity” of employees working from vacation destinations like Bali. In a memo to staff, he also expressed concerns about declining office attendance and its impact on company culture, innovation, and performance.He said that there’s a need to “restart our ambitious culture” and drew comparisons to tech giants like Amazon, Tesla, and Apple, which have all implemented various return-to-office mandates.","Bolt CEO Markus Villig has asked employees to return to office for 12 days a month.

What Microsoft said on firing employees

Microsoft has reportedly fired two employees for organising an unauthorised vigil at the company's headquarters in Redmond, Washington, supporting Palestinians killed in Gaza during Israel 's war with Hamas .According to a report by news agency Associated Press, the two employees said they were fired by phone call late on Thursday (October 24). The staff had organised the event at lunchtime. Both employees were said to be members of a group called “No Azure for Apartheid"" that has opposed Microsoft's sale of its cloud-computing technology to the Israeli government.The employees claimed that the event was similar to other Microsoft-sanctioned employee gift campaigns for people in need.“We have so many community members within Microsoft who have lost family, lost friends or loved ones. But Microsoft really failed to have the space for us where we can come together and share our grief and honor the memories of people who can no longer speak for themselves,” said Abdelrahman Mohamed, a researcher and data scientist.Another fired worker, Hossam Nasr, said the purpose of the vigil was both “to honour the victims of the Palestinian genocide in Gaza and to call attention to Microsoft’s complicity in the genocide” because of the use of its technology by the Israeli military.Without giving much details, Microsoft said that it has “ended the employment of some individuals in accordance with internal policy”.The tech giant added that it remains “dedicated to maintaining a professional and respectful work environment. Due to privacy and confidentiality considerations, we cannot provide specific details.”The news comes months after Google also fired more than 50 workers who were protesting against the company's cloud contract with the Israel government. Called Project Nimbus , the $1.2 billion contract has been jointly awarded to Google and Amazon.com to supply the Israeli government with cloud services.Google has said the Nimbus contract ""is not directed at highly sensitive, classified, or military workloads relevant to weapons or intelligence services.""",Microsoft fired two employees for organising an unauthorised vigil.

Swiggy is reportedly planning to expand into quick online pharmacy delivery. For this, the food and grocery delivery platform is said to have partnered with online medical delivery PharmEasy. This collaboration will enable Swiggy to offer 10-minute deliveries of medicines, including prescription drugs through its Instamart section. The food delivery platform will reportedly use PharmEasy 's existing infrastructure and regulatory approvals for this.While Swiggy's Instamart already offered basic over-the-counter medicines, this partnership may also allow the company to expand its offerings and tap into a new customer base. According to a report by Moneycontrol, the pilot program is currently underway in Bengaluru and may be planning to expand to other cities in the coming days. This will help the company to compete with other online medicine delivery platforms including Tata’s 1mg and Apollo Pharmacy ’s online platform.With this feature, Swiggy may be able to deliver prescribed medicine to doorsteps in 10 minutes through its Instamart service. Pharmeasy has also reportedly set up stores within Swiggy’s dark stores for the initiative. Swiggy will start delivering medicines like pain relievers, fever medicines as well as medicines that require a valid prescription.“The prescription can either be uploaded by the customer or generated by a doctor during a consultation on Pharmeasy,” a person familiar with the program reportedly noted.This involves a unique ""shop-in-shop"" model within Instamart's dark stores, allowing Swiggy to deliver prescription drugs, a first for quick commerce . This move comes as Swiggy seeks to increase average order values and combat widening losses, despite rising revenue.In Q1 FY24, Swiggy’s losses grew by 8% to Rs 611 crore from Rs 564 crore a year earlier, driven by rising expenses, as detailed in its updated draft red herring prospectus (DRHP). The company’s spending increased by 27% to Rs 3,908 crore, up from Rs 3,073 crore in the same period last year.Meanwhile, revenue from operations rose by 35% to Rs 3,222.2 crore in Q1 FY25, compared to Rs 2,389.8 crore in the same quarter of the previous fiscal year.","Swiggy is reportedly planning to expand into quick online pharmacy delivery.

Xiaomi SU7: The Tesla rival from China

Xiaomi is known for its smartphones. The Chinese giant has been holding a formidable position in the smartphone market in India and China for the past many years now. There now seems another segment where the company may be making a mark --EVs. Xiaomi's EV Xiaomi SU7 has impressed many. An unlikely compliment has now come from none other than the CEO of rival car maker Ford .Ford CEO Jim Farley has expressed admiration for the Xiaomi SU7, a Chinese electric vehicle . Farley, who has been driving the imported SUV for six months, praised its performance and technology integration.The Xiaomi SU7, a sleek sedan reminiscent of a Porsche Panamera, offers impressive specifications. It boasts a top speed of 62 mph in just 2.7 seconds, said to be outperforming the Tesla Model 3. Additionally, it promises a range of 435 miles on a single charge and integrates seamlessly with Xiaomi's smart home ecosystem.Farley's endorsement underscores the rapid advancements in Chinese electric vehicle technology. Companies like Xiaomi and BYD have successfully produced affordable EVs that are both efficient and technologically advanced. This achievement is attributed to factors such as supportive government policies, access to raw materials, and a massive domestic market.However, geopolitical tensions have limited the direct entry of Chinese automakers into the US market. The Biden administration's recent imposition of a 100% tariff on Chinese electric vehicles further exacerbates this challenge.Despite these hurdles, Chinese brands like BYD are expanding their global footprint, targeting developing markets and establishing manufacturing facilities in regions like Brazil. The affordable BYD Seagull EV, priced at around $9,700, demonstrates the potential for disruptive pricing in the electric vehicle market.As the electric vehicle landscape continues to evolve, the competition between US and Chinese automakers is intensifying. While geopolitical factors may hinder direct market access, the influence of Chinese technology and innovation on the global automotive industry is undeniable.","Ford CEO Jim Farley has expressed admiration for the Xiaomi SU7, a Chinese electric vehicle.

"When and why US commerce secretary Gina Raimondo 'requested' CEOs of Microsoft, Google and other US companies to buy chips from Intel",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/when-and-why-us-commerce-secretary-gina-raimondo-told-ceos-of-microsoft-google-and-other-us-companies-to-buy-chips-from-intel/articleshow/114598235.cms,"What made US government invest billions in Intel

The mounting troubles of chip giant Intel may be a nightmare for the Biden administration as well. Reason: Intel has been the poster boy for the US Chips Act announced by the US President Joe Biden government in 2022. Intel is the single biggest recipient of federal money from the CHIPS Act, a bipartisan bill aimed at making the United States less reliant on Asia for the tiny electronics that power everything from cars to iPads. Intel is also the sole recipient of a new $3 billion government contract to make advanced chips for the US military.The Biden administration is now said to be facing mounting pressure to revitalize the US semiconductor industry, with a particular focus on Intel.According to a report in New York Times, at an annual gathering of tech executives and billionaires in Sun Valley, Idaho, earlier this year, US commerce secretary Gina Raimondo met with CEOs from Microsoft , Google and other companies and encouraged them to order their semiconductors from the United States, including from Intel. It was important to make more chips in America, she told them, and Intel, the US chip giant, was critical to that effort.Raimondo is reported to have made similar requests in meetings and phone calls over the past year. She has, as per NYT report, urged executives at Apple, Amazon, Nvidia, AMD, Marvell Technology and other companies to consider ordering chips from Intel’s US manufacturing plants.Intel CEO Patrick Gelsinger committed to invest over $100 billion to expand in Arizona, Ohio, New Mexico and Oregon after promises of more than $20 billion in government support. However, Intel’s worsening business has reportedly caused concern in Capitol Hill.Intel CEO said that investments in the United States would proceed, but the company's 15,000 layoffs announced earlier this year and delay in opening of a large factory in Ohio is said to have made government officials anxious. Intel announced its quarterly results in August, its profits saw a disastrous fall and it halted a decades-old shareholder dividend. The company's stock has plummeted more than 20% since the beginning of this year.When Intel project got standing ovation at the US State of the Union addressOhio factory is the project that Biden cited in his State of the Union addresses in 2022 and 2023. In fact, Intel CEO was Biden’s guest at the State of the Union address in 2022. In his speech, US President Biden described a $20 billion project that Intel had planned for Ohio as a “field of dreams” and said that the company would invest $100 billion across the United States.“That would be the biggest investment in manufacturing in American history. And all they’re waiting for is for you to pass this bill,” Biden said to a standing ovation.In an interview to NYT, Raimondo said that her requests for companies to buy Intel chips were part of a push on behalf of all the US manufacturers. “Of course, I’d be doing everything I can to make sure Intel is successful,” she said. “But really, my message to any of these companies, whether it’s Apple or AMD or Nvidia, Amazon, all of them, is we need your demand for U.S.-made chips.“We’re going to get it done, and that is not dependent on any one company,” she added.","Intel has been the poster boy for the US Chips Act announced by the US President Joe Biden government in 2022.

UK CMA also probing AI deal



Google's partnership with artificial intelligence (AI) startup Anthropic is facing a potential hurdle in the UK. The country's competition watchdog has reportedly raised concerns and called for a deeper investigation into the deal. The Competition and Markets Authority ( CMA ) is scrutinising the deal's potential impact on the AI market and innovation. This investigation could delay or even derail the partnership, which involves Google investing in Anthropic and gaining a stake in the company. The Alphabet-owned tech giant has pledged to invest $2 billion into the AI startup last year. Before the investment, Google also signed a major cloud agreement with Anthropic.According to a report by Bloomberg, CMA has said that it’s opening a formal phase one merger probe . This investigation suggests how regulators are taking closer order of the wave of investment into startup AI firms.In a statement to Bloomberg, a Google spokesperson said that Anthropic is free to use multiple cloud providers and it does not demand exclusive tech rights.another Anthropic spokesperson added.Microsoft ’s partnership with OpenAI may also face scrutiny in the UK. Meanwhile, Amazon ’s $4 billion investment in Anthropic was approved in September.In its investigation of Amazon, the CMA found that Anthropic’s revenue in the UK fell below the threshold required to justify intervention. Additionally, the CMA opened and quickly closed probes into Microsoft’s deals with Mistral and Inflection.The CMA has set a deadline of December 19 to determine if a deeper, more detailed investigation is needed for the Microsoft deal.The CMA has been leading efforts to ensure that investments made by major tech firms in the AI sector don’t impact the market dynamics to prevent a few dominant companies from monopolising the industry.Apart from the UK’s CMA, the US Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) and the European Union ( EU ) are also reviewing various AI-related deals.","UK CMA also probing AI deal between Google and Anthropic.

This is a very sad day for the whole of India!

Goodbye, Amitabh Bachchan

How to safeguard

What Instagram-parent company Meta has to say

If you have come across a post on Instagram that says “A hard day for India: We say goodbye to Amitabh Bachchan ”, do not let your intrigue click the “Learn More” link. It’s a scam! Scammers are using sophisticated techniques to entangle unsuspected users in a fraudulent investment scheme.This scenario is becoming increasingly common as scammers exploit social media platforms like Instagram, Facebook and X to lure unsuspecting users into fraudulent investment schemes using fake celebrity endorsements. Here’s an explainer on how these scams work and how you can be safe.These scams are a version of celebrity scam in which scammers use photos or videos along with catchy headlines to peak users’ interest. These scam often involve fabricated news articles and fictitious interviews where celebrities seemingly endorse dubious platforms or apps promising quick riches.One such scam is prevalent on Instagram in which a photo of Amitabh Bacchan is being used along with a catchy headline. The Times of India tech team came across this scam and found how scammers target users on the social media platform.First an ad in Stories shows a post with Bachchan’s photo and headline:When we clicked the link, it redirected us to another page that looked like an interview in a national daily. The scam involved a fake news article in the form of an interview, fabricated to create an illusion of credibility and legitimacy.The sophisticated scam campaign was using Amitabh Bachchan's image to promote a platform called “Immediate 7.6 Chantix”.“I don't have a second business, but I started earning on the platform Immediate 7.6 Chantix A year ago, I invested only 21 000 rupees and quickly increased my investment. Now, I live on the daily income from this platform,” the article reads, suggesting that this is said by Bachchan.These scams are not limited to celebrities and fraudsters are also using images of other public figures to deceive users.To avoid falling prey to online scams, users should be wary of sensational headlines. The second important thing is to always double-check the website address to ensure it matches the legitimate source. In this case, the link led to a suspicious domain (sisueue.com) instead of the official news site, a clear red flag.The third way is to look for grammatical and spelling errors. There are very few chances of news organisations making such mistakes.According to a report by Moneycontrol, Meta has emphasised their commitment to removing content that violates their policies.“We remove content when we are made aware of it and when it violates our policies whether it was created by AI or a person. Advertisers running ads across Meta technologies must follow our Community Standards and our Advertising Standards. We use automated and, in some instances, manual review to enforce our policies,” a Meta spokesperson said.“Earlier this week, we also announced that we’re testing the use of facial recognition technology to help protect people from celeb-bait ads and enable faster account recovery.

A one-hour video recording of a ""digital arrest"" scam has gone viral, offering a glimpse into the tactics employed by these fraudsters. The video, featuring a journalist targeted by the scammers, serves as a warning for the public to remain vigilant against such online threats.An investigative journalist from Gujarat posted a series of videos on X (formerly known as Twitter) to warn the people about digital arrest scam . Gamers received a WhatsApp call from scammers informing him that his phone number is being misused. “First I received a call from an unknown number informing me that my mobile numbers would be blocked in the next four hours as they were being used for harassment and financial fraud. Scammers make this call in the name of Telecom Regularity of India (TRAI),” posted Gamers.The caller asked Gajera to either reach the Lucknow police station within 12 hours or register his statement via WhatsApp video call. Gamers selected the second option and then a scammer, disguised as a police officer, appeared in a setting resembling a police station. Gajera astutely noted that this tactic is a common ploy used by scammers, as it's during the video call that victims are most likely to believe the legitimacy of the threat.The scammer, posing as a police officer, informed Gajera that his Aadhaar details and phone number had been misused in illegal activities. The scammer then attempted to manipulate Gajera into filing a complaint while keeping him on the line.The scammer falsely accused Gajera of being involved in 17 harassment cases. To further their deception, they shared a forged document purportedly issued by the Supreme Court and TRAI, naming Gajera as a suspect. “Next, he started to inquire about whether I use UPI apps or net banking so they can use this mode to transfer the amount. In the end, the scammer police officer gives this case to DCP. He informed me that I needed to transfer all the money I had in my bank accounts, which would be returned if I was found innocent, and they would give me a certificate!” added Gajera.For an hour and a half, Gajera was held captive in a virtual ""digital arrest,"" unable to terminate the call or leave his phone. He intentionally endured the ordeal to document the scam and share it online, aiming to alert others about this dangerous tactic.The video also explains that how the scammers employ a variety of tactics to create an air of legitimacy, including:* Fake Aadhaar card: The scammers display a fake Aadhaar card, a crucial Indian identity document, supposedly linked to a criminal case against the victim.* Forged legal documents: They brandish a fabricated letter purportedly from the Supreme Court, further escalating the perceived threat.* Misuse of symbols of authority: They wear a police uniform on camera and display the Indian flag in the background, attempting to project an aura of officialdom.","An investigative journalist from Gujarat posted a series of videos on X (formerly known as Twitter) to warn the people about digital arrest scam.
