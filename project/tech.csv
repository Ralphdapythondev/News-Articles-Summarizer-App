How MLow improve audio quality during WhatsApp calls

WhatsApp has announced multiple updates in audio and video calling across all platforms. It said that the users of the instant messaging app can now share audio while screen sharing. The app’s parent company also talked about Meta Low Bitrate ( MLow ) codec to improve call quality.MLow codec offers two-times-better quality with computational complexity than Opus – the open source codec Meta deployed across its instant calling products like Instagram and Messenger .“We are proud to announce Meta Low Bitrate audio codec, aka MLow, which achieves two-times-better quality than Opus. Even more importantly, we are able to achieve this great quality while keeping MLow’s computational complexity 10 percent lower than that of Opus,” the company said.The company said it first deployed MLow to all Instagram and Messenger calls and are now rolling it out on WhatsApp. Meta claimed that it has “already seen incredible improvement in user engagement driven by better audio quality.”Meta shared multiple examples in the form of short audio clips offering a difference between the audio quality. They can be accessed here and the company recommends using a pair of headphones.The technology first divides the raw audio into low and high-frequency bands for separate encoding, which utilises shared information between the bands for improved compression.First, the individual bands are encoded, and then a range encoder further compresses the data for transmission. The decoder then reverses the process to recreate the audio signal from the compressed payload.“MLow has greatly enhanced audio quality on low-end devices while still ensuring calls are end-to-end encrypted. We are really excited about what we have accomplished in just the last two years—from developing a new codec to successfully shipping it to billions of users around the globe,” the company said, adding that it will continue to improve audio quality during calls.",WhatsApp has announced multiple updates in audio and video calling across all platforms.

Tesla shareholders: What Elon Musk is doing is like CEO of Coca-Cola CEO starting a rival soda company and sending ingredients to it,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/tesla-shareholders-what-elon-musk-is-doing-is-like-ceo-of-coca-cola-ceo-starting-a-rival-soda-company-and-sending-ingredients-to-it/articleshow/110977569.cms,"What Tesla shareholders' lawsuit against Elon Musk claims

Some Tesla shareholders are upset with CEO Elon Musk. According to a report by TechCrunch, Tesla shareholders are suing CEO Elon Musk and the company's board of directors over a controversial move: Musk's creation of xAI, a new artificial intelligence company. The lawsuit alleges that xAI directly competes with Tesla and accuses Musk of diverting resources and talent from Tesla to fuel his new venture.The lawsuit, filed in Delaware Chancery Court by the Cleveland Bakers and Teamsters Pension Fund, along with Daniel Hazen and Micahel Giampietro on behalf of Tesla, alleges that Musk and the board breached their fiduciary duties to shareholders. They argue that allowing Musk to launch a competing business directly enriches him at the expense of Tesla.“The notion that the CEO of a major, publicly-traded Delaware corporation could — with the evident approval of his board — start a competing company, and then divert talent and resources from his corporation to the startup, is preposterous,” reads the lawsuit filed. It compares Musk’s actions to a hypothetical situation involving the CEO of Coca-Cola starting a rival soft-drink company and sending ingredients to it. By highlighting this absurdity, the lawsuit aims to emphasize the alleged breach of trust by Musk and the board.This lawsuit is a significant challenge to Musk's decision to launch xAI, especially considering his past threats to develop AI elsewhere if he wasn't granted more control over Tesla. Tesla's stock valuation relies heavily on Musk's claims that the company is more than just an electric vehicle manufacturer, but an industry leader in AI as well. This claim is a key factor behind Tesla's stock price rivaling tech giants and surpassing the combined value of the top four automakers.The plaintiffs further claim that Musk violated Tesla's code of ethics by creating and leading xAI, with the board failing to take any action. They seek a court order forcing Musk to relinquish his stake in xAI and transfer it to Tesla.The lawsuit strongly criticizes the situation, comparing it to a hypothetical scenario where the CEO of Coca-Cola starts a rival soda company and diverts resources to it.","Tesla shareholders are suing CEO Elon Musk and the company's board of directors over a controversial move: Musk's creation of xAI, a new artificial intelligence company.

Read former employee's note on all that was 'wrong with Alexa' and how Amazon 'fumbled big time' with its voice assistant,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/read-former-employees-note-on-all-that-was-wrong-with-alexa-and-how-amazon-fumbled-big-time-with-its-voice-assistant/articleshow/110977545.cms,"Here's the long X post, titled 'How Alexa dropped the ball on being the top conversational system on the planet' written by Mihail Eric:

A few weeks ago OpenAI released GPT-4o ushering in a new standard for multimodal, conversational experiences with sophisticated reasoning capabilities.

Several days later, my good friends at PolyAI announced their Series C fundraising round after tremendous growth in the usage of their enterprise voice assistant.

Amid this news, a former Alexa colleague messaged me: You’d think voice assistants would have been our forte at Alexa.

For context, I joined Alexa AI as a research scientist in early 2019. By this time, the Alexa consumer device had existed for 5 years and was already in 100M+ homes throughout the world.

In 2019, Alexa was experiencing a period of hypergrowth. Dozens of new teams sprouted every quarter, huge financial resources were invested, and senior leadership made it clear that Alexa was going to be one of Amazon’s big bets moving forward.

My team was born amidst all this with a simple charter: bring the latest and greatest in AI research into the Alexa product and ecosystem. I’ve often described our group (later dubbed the Conversational Modeling team) as

Google

Brain meets Alexa AI-SWAT team.

Over the course of the 2.5 years I was there, we grew from 2 to ~20 and tackled every part of the conversational systems stack.

We built the first LLMs for the organization (though back then we didn’t call them LLMs), we built knowledge grounded response generators (though we didn’t call it RAG), and we pioneered prototypes for what it would mean to make Alexa a multimodal agent in your home.

We had all the resources, talent, and momentum to become the unequivocal market leader in conversational AI. But most of that tech never saw the light of day and never received any noteworthy press.

Why?

The reality is Alexa AI was riddled with technical and bureaucratic problems.

Bad Technical Process

–

Alexa put a huge emphasis on protecting customer data with guardrails in place to prevent leakage and access. Definitely a crucial practice, but one consequence was that the internal infrastructure for developers was agonizingly painful to work with.

It would take weeks to get access to any internal data for analysis or experiments. Data was poorly annotated. Documentation was either nonexistent or stale.

Experiments had to be run in resource-limited compute environments. Imagine trying to train a transformer model when all you can get a hold of is CPUs. Unacceptable for a company sitting on one of the largest collections of accelerated hardware in the world.

I remember on one occasion our team did an analysis demonstrating that the annotation scheme for some subset of utterance data was completely wrong, leading to incorrect data labels.

That meant for months our internal annotation team had been mislabeling thousands of data points every single day. When we attempted to get the team to change their annotation taxonomy, we discovered it would require a herculean effort to get even the smallest thing modified.

We had to get the team’s PM onboard, then their manager’s buy-in, then submit a preliminary change request, then get that approved (a multi-month-long process end-to-end).

And most importantly, there was no immediate story for the team’s PM to make a promotion case through fixing this issue other than “it’s scientifically the right thing to do and could lead to better models for some other team.” No incentive meant no action taken.

Since that wasn’t our responsibility and the lift from our side wasn’t worth the effort, we closed that chapter and moved on.

For all I know, they could still be mislabeling those utterances to this day.

Fragmented Org Structures

—

Alexa’s org structure was decentralized by design meaning there were multiple small teams working on sometimes identical problems across geographic locales.

This introduced an almost Darwinian flavor to org dynamics where teams scrambled to get their work done to avoid getting reorged and subsumed into a competing team.

The consequence was an organization plagued by antagonistic mid-managers that had little interest in collaborating for the greater good of Alexa and only wanted to preserve their own fiefdoms.

My group by design was intended to span projects, whereby we found teams that aligned with our research/product interests and urged them to collaborate on ambitious efforts. The resistance and lack of action we encountered was soul-crushing.

I remember on one occasion we were coordinating a project to scale out the large transformers model training I had been leading. This was an ambitious effort which, if done correctly, could have been the genesis of an Amazon ChatGPT (well before ChatGPT was released).

Our Alexa team met with an internal cloud team which independently was initiating similar undertakings. While the goal was to find a way to collaborate on this training infrastructure, over the course of several weeks there were many half-baked promises made which never came to fruition.

At the end of it, our team did our own thing and the sister team did their own thing. Duplicated efforts due to no shared common ground. With no data, infrastructure, or lesson sharing, this inevitably hurt the quality of produced models.

As another example, the Alexa skills ecosystem was Alexa’s attempt to apply Amazonian decentralization to the dialogue problem. Have individual teams own individual skills.

But dialogue is not conducive to that degree of separation of concerns. How can you seamlessly hand off conversational context between skills? This means endowing the system with multi-turn memory (a long-standing dream of dialogue research).

The internal design of the skills ecosystem made achieving this infeasible because each skill acted like its own independent bot. It was conversational AI by an opinionated bot committee each with its own agenda.

Product-Science Misalignment

—

Alexa was viciously customer-focused which I believe is admirable and a principle every company should practice. Within Alexa, this meant that every engineering and science effort had to be aligned to some downstream product.

That did introduce tension for our team because we were supposed to be taking experimental bets for the platform’s future. These bets couldn’t be baked into product without hacks or shortcuts in the typical quarter as was the expectation.

So we had to constantly justify our existence to senior leadership and massage our projects with metrics that could be seen as more customer-facing.

For example, in one of our projects to build an open-domain chat system, the success metric (i.e. a single integer value representing overall conversational quality) imposed by senior leadership had no scientific grounding and was borderline impossible to achieve.

This introduced product/science conflict in every weekly meeting to track the project’s progress leading to manager churn every few months and an eventual sunsetting of the effort.

—

As we look forward, in the battle for the future of the conversational AI market, I still believe it’s anyone’s game.

Today Alexa has sold 500M+ devices, which is a mind-boggling user data moat. But that alone is not enough.

Here’s how I would organize a dialogue systems effort from the ground-up:

Invest in robust developer infrastructure especially around access to compute, data quality assurance, and streamlined data collection processes. Data and compute are the lifeblood of modern ML systems so proactively setting up this foundation is imperative.

Make LLMs the fundamental building block of the dialogue flows. In retrospect, the Alexa skills ecosystem was a premature initiative for the abilities of conversational systems at the time. I liken it to when Leap Motion created and released a developer SDK before the underlying hardware device was stable.

But with the power of modern LLMs, I’m optimistic about redesigning a developer conversational toolkit with LLMs as their primitives.

Ensure product timelines don’t dictate science research time frames. Because things are moving so fast in the AI world, it’s hard not to feel the pressure of shipping quickly. But there are still so many unsolved problems that will take time to solve.

Of course you should conduct research aggressively, but don’t have delivery cycles measured in quarters, as this will produce inferior systems to meet deadlines.

—

If you’re thinking about the future of multimodal conversational systems and interfaces, I would love to hear from you. We’ve got work to do!

WhatsApp getting MLow codec

WhatsApp is bringing three major updates to its platforms across devices. These updates are aimed at making calls “even bigger and better” and will be rolled out over the next few weeks.“Since we brought Calling to WhatsApp back in 2015, we’ve continued to improve it with the introduction of group calls, video calls, and multi-platform support.

How iOS 18 may solve one of the 'biggest problem' that users have with social media apps,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-ios-18-may-solve-one-of-the-biggest-problem-that-users-have-with-social-media-apps/articleshow/110974583.cms,"What is changing

How its will work

Apple 's upcoming iOS 18 update will introduce stricter controls on how apps access user contact information . The move essentially targets social networking apps that often request contact access to connect users with friends or suggest who to follow.Currently, social media apps receive the permission to access all or no contacts via a single prompt. If tapped 'allow', the apps get a broad access to the entire contact list. iOS 18 changes this with a two-step permission process revealed during the recently-held Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference.""Control how you share contacts with apps,"" the pop-up will read.""Decide which contacts to share with an app, rather than giving it access to all your contacts. Or give the app access only to those you message and call most,"" it adds.In the first prompt, users will encounter a familiar prompt to allow or deny access to their entire contact list. If the permission is granted, a second prompt emerges, allowing users to choose to share specific contacts with the app, rather than the entire list. If the access is denied, the second pop-up won't emerge.According to Apple, this change is to curb the access provided to future contacts. Once granted permission, the social media apps can access not only existing contacts but also any new ones added over time. The two-stage process aims to give users more granular control over which contacts are shared with specific apps.It's worth noting that some app developers have misused the existing single-permission system. They may have blocked users who declined contact access from using the app entirely. While iOS 18 doesn't directly address this practice, the increased user control over contact sharing may indirectly impact such app behaviour.","Apple's upcoming iOS 18 update will introduce stricter controls on how apps access user contact information.

Increased data usage: Unexpected spikes in data usage may indicate that your phone is sending information to a third party without your knowledge.

Strange activity: If you notice unusual activities such as apps opening on their own, text messages you didn't send, or calls you didn't make, your phone might be compromised.

Pop-ups and ads: An influx of pop-up ads, especially when not using a browser, can be a sign of adware infection.

Unrecognised apps: If you find apps installed that you don't remember downloading, it could be a sign of unauthorised access.

Slow performance: A sudden drop in your phone's performance speed can be a result of malware hogging resources.

Unusual charges on your bill: Unexpected charges for premium services or international calls might indicate that a hacker is exploiting your phone.

Immediate actions to take if your phone is hacked

Disconnect from the internet: The first step is to disconnect your phone from the internet to stop any data transfer. Turn off Wi-Fi and mobile data immediately.

Enable aeroplane mode: Switch your phone to aeroplane mode to cut off all communication signals, preventing further access by the hacker.

Check and remove suspicious apps: Go through your installed apps and delete any that seem suspicious or that you don’t remember installing.

Change passwords: Using another device, change the passwords for all your important accounts, including email, social media, and banking apps. Ensure that the new passwords are strong and unique.

Install and run security software: Install reputable mobile security software and run a full scan to detect and remove any malware or spyware.

Update your phone’s OS and apps: Ensure your phone’s operating system and apps are up-to-date. Updates often include security patches that fix vulnerabilities.

Factory reset: If the problem persists, consider performing a factory reset. This will erase all data and settings, returning your phone to its original state. Make sure to back up important data before doing this.

Contact your service provider: Inform your mobile service provider about the issue. They can provide assistance and may have additional security measures to help protect your account.

Monitor your accounts: Keep a close eye on your bank and other important accounts for any suspicious activity and report it immediately.

Preventative measures

Use strong, unique passwords: Ensure all your accounts are protected with strong, unique passwords. Consider using a password manager.

Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): Add an extra layer of security by enabling two-factor authentication on your accounts.

Be cautious with downloads: Only download apps from reputable sources like the official app stores and avoid clicking on suspicious links.

Regularly update your device: Keep your phone’s operating system and apps updated to protect against known vulnerabilities.

Install security software: Use mobile security software to protect against malware, spyware, and other threats.

Avoid public Wi-Fi: Public Wi-Fi networks can be insecure. Use a VPN if you need to access sensitive information over public Wi-Fi.

SpaceX and Elon Musk on the lawsuit

Lawsuit comes a day after WSJ's report claiming 'sexual misconduct'

There may be some trouble for SpaceX CEO Elon Musk . Eight former SpaceX engineers have reportedly filed a lawsuit against Musk on Wednesday (June 12), accusing the CEO of sexual harassment and retaliation. The same group of fired employees are said to have also filed complaints with the US National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) about SpaceX’s alleged retaliation. Bloomberg first reported on the lawsuit. The eight employees reportedly include four women and four men. The complaint targets both Musk and SpaceX.“Musk knowingly and purposefully created an unwelcome hostile work environment based upon his conduct of interjecting into the workplace vile sexual photographs, memes, and commentary that demeaned women and/or the LGBTQ+ community,” the eight former employees wrote in the filing. “It was also common for engineers to apply crude and demeaning names to products in an attempt at humor, often at the expense of women and LGBTQ+ individuals. For example, the name ‘Upskirt Camera’ was used for a camera on the first stage of the Falcon rocket that views the bottom of the second stage,” the filing further adds.According to a Bloomberg report, the filing further claims that the former SpaceX engineers that Musk made the decision to fire them in retaliation for the open letter that they wrote in 2022, highlighting Musk's ""problematic behavior"". The complaint claims that when a SpaceX HR official suggested that the company conduct a formal investigation before taking any decisive action, Musk replied, “I don’t care — fire them.”The open letter against Elon Musk is said to have been shared in an internal SpaceX Microsoft Teams channel with more than 2,600 employees. “Elon’s behavior in the public sphere is a frequent source of distraction and embarrassment for us, particularly in recent weeks,” the letter stated. “As our CEO and most prominent spokesperson, Elon is seen as the face of SpaceX — every Tweet that Elon sends is a de facto public statement by the company. It is critical to make clear to our teams and to our potential talent pool that his messaging does not reflect our work, our mission, or our values,” it further added.SpaceX and Elon Musk did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the lawsuit. SpaceX has previously denied wrongdoing and said that the fired employees violated policies. It also said Musk was not involved in their terminations.The lawsuit comes just a day after the Wall Street Journal reported allegations that Musk made sexual advances to women at SpaceX, including a former intern he had sex with. SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell was quoted in the story accusing the Journal of presenting “untruths, mischaracterizations, and revisionist history,” and saying “Elon is one of the best humans I know.”",Eight former SpaceX engineers have reportedly filed a lawsuit against Elon Musk.

In the ever-evolving world of social media, Instagram has emerged as a marketplace teeming with opportunities and risks alike. Amid the plethora of legitimate businesses, scams have proliferated, targeting unsuspecting consumers with fraudulent schemes. One such incident has recently come to light, involving a USA-based businesswoman who fell victim to an elaborate jewellery scam on Instagram.A man who issued a fake certificate of registration for selling hallmarked gold to a city jeweller was arrested on Thursday. The jewellers, Gorav Soni and Rajendra Soni, are currently on the run. The accused, identified as Nand Kishore, was apprehended after interrogation revealed his role in the scam. This arrest followed a complaint from Charish Nortez, a businesswoman from the USA, who purchased jewellery worth approximately Rs 6 crore, only to discover she had been duped.Additional Deputy Commissioner of Police (North), Bajrang Singh Shekhawat, who is leading the investigation, disclosed that Nortez had been conducting business with Jaipur-based jewellers Gorav Soni and his father Rajendra Soni for many years. The duo allegedly sold her 9-carat gold jewellery instead of the promised 14-carat gold, and moissanite stones in place of diamonds, which are approximately 50 times cheaper.The fraud came to light when Nortez had the jewellery tested during an exhibition in the USA and discovered the deception. She then travelled to Jaipur to confront the jewellers, who in turn filed a case against her at Manak Chowk police station in March 2023. The USA embassy intervened, prompting an investigation under the direction of the Jaipur commissioner.During the investigation, the hallmark certificates were scrutinised to verify the authenticity of the gold and diamond purity. It was revealed that the certificates were fake, leading to the arrest of Nand Kishore, who had issued them.""The hallmark certificates were found to be not authentic, and the person who issued them was arrested,"" said Singh.The jewellers, Gorav Soni and Rajendra Soni, are currently absconding. In India, a hallmarking licence is mandatory for manufacturing and selling gold. However, the investigation uncovered that many jewellers are circumventing this requirement by procuring fake certificates from laboratories, thereby misleading customers.This case highlights the ongoing issue of fraudulent practices in the jewellery industry and underscores the importance of verifying the authenticity of hallmark certificates when purchasing gold and diamond jewellery. Authorities are continuing their efforts to track down the absconding jewellers and prevent further instances of such scams.As social media platforms continue to grow as marketplaces, consumers are urged to exercise caution and due diligence to avoid falling prey to similar fraudulent schemes.","A man who issued a fake certificate of registration for selling hallmarked gold to a city jeweller was arrested on Thursday.

How Apple is trying to regain its position in China



Apple has achieved a new milestone in iPhone sales. As per data from Stocklytics.com (seen by Patently Apple), the Cupertino-based tech giant has about to reach the $2 trillion mark in iPhone's lifetime sales. This achievement comes after a recent decline in market share due to competition from Chinese brands like Xiaomi and Huawei.Since its introduction in 2007, this has been Apple’s most successful product as the company keeps updating its smartphones with new models and features.As per Statista data, Apple grossed $78.7 billion from iPhone sales within five years after releasing the first mode. Two years later, in FY 2014, this figure jumped to $101.9 billion and continued rising.The tech giant experienced several challenging years, especially in 2019 and 2020 when consumers worldwide reduced their spending budgets amid the pandemic. The report alsoclaims that iPhone sales have doubled and hit record highs in 2022 and 2023.During those two years, Apple grossed over $405 billion from selling iPhones, the highest figures in its history. Despite the revenue figures dropping slightly in the second quarter of FY 2024, iPhone sales remain strong. Statistics show Apple grossed $115.6 billion from iPhone sales in H1 FY 2024, pushing its lifetime revenue to a whopping $1.95 trillion.In Q1 FY 2009, Apple’s iPhone sales also accounted for about a quarter of Apple’s total revenue. Since then, this figure has more than doubled and hit 50.64% in Q1 2024.China is one of the biggest iPhone markets for Apple. According to a report by Counterpoint, Apple’s iPhone sales declined by more than 19% as Huawei saw 70% year-on-year growth in its smartphone sales in the country.To increase iPhone sales in China, Apple reportedly launched an aggressive discounting campaign on its official Tmall website in China in May. With these discounts, the company aims to fight off growing competition from local brands like Huawei. The latest discounts were steeper than those offered earlier this year.","Apple grossed $115.6 billion from iPhone sales in H1 FY 2024, pushing its lifetime revenue to a whopping $1.95 trillion.

Countries where WhatsApp is banned

Why these countries have banned WhatsApp?

WhatsApp bans 80 lakh accounts in India in March 2024

Apple removed Meta ’s WhatsApp from its App Store in China last month. The company then complied with China’s internet regulator’s – Cyberspace Administration order. In April this year, WhatsApp filed a plea with the Delhi high court to challenge India's 2021 IT rules for social media intermediaries, ‘threatening’ to leave the country if asked to break end-to-end-encryption.However, it is not only China where WhatsApp faces restrictions. Despite over 2 billion users worldwide, the social media app is banned in many countries. Although there are some workarounds like using VPN and other tools to overcome these restrictions, but not everyone is willing to take this extra step.Coming back to the number of countries where WhatsApp is banned or faces restrictions, there are 6 in total. These are China, North Korea, Iran, Qatar, Syria and United Arab Emirates (UAE).China has barred the use of foreign messaging apps like WhatsApp for years due to the “Great Wall”' restrictions. This has resulted in other messaging platforms like WeChat and Weibo dominating the Chinese market. Similarly, North Korea, which has one of the most restrictive national policies, does not allow its citizens to use WhatsApp or any other major messaging app used globally.Other countries that have banned WhatsApp include Iran, Syria, Qatar and United Arab Emirates (UAE). Syria and Iran have banned WhatsApp to regulate the information flow in the war-torn country. The UAE, on the other hand, has blocked WhatsApp voice and video calls to promote local telecommunication companies. Qatar too has blocked WhatsApp calls, but allows its citizens to send text messages over the app.In another news, WhatsApp said that it has banned more than 7.9 million accounts in India between March 1 to March 31, 2024. Releasing its latest monthly report, the platform said that 1,430,000of these accounts were proactively banned, before any reports from users.The report was published under the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021.","Despite over 2 billion users worldwide, the social media app is banned in many countries.
