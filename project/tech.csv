Microsoft outage impacted 8.5million devices

Microsoft has released an official recovery tool to help IT admins expedite the recovery process of Windows laptops and machines impacted by the latest Crowdstrike outage. While Crowdstike has released an update to fix its software that led to Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) errors, solving it manually can take a long time.Microsoft’s latest tool creates a bootable USB drive that IT admins can use to quickly recover impacted machines.Microsoft’s latest tool requires one to start the Windows PC/laptop in the PE environment to boot the drive via USB. It will then access the disk of the affected machine, and automatically delete the problematic CrowdStrike file to allow the machine to boot properly.Since this method does not require admin rights on the machine, it makes the process less manual as the tool is simply accessing the disk without booting into the local copy of Windows. In case a disk is protected by BitLocker encryption, the tool will prompt for the BitLocker recovery key and then continue to fix the CrowdStrike update.Microsoft Windows outage that crippled the day-to-day working of businesses and individuals affected nearly 8.5 million Microsoft devices. “We currently estimate that CrowdStrike's update affected 8.5 million Windows devices, or less than one percent of all Windows machines,” Microsoft said in the blog.A software update issued by CrowdStrike, a major cybersecurity firm, triggered a significant IT outage that impacted numerous critical systems worldwide. As per security experts, CrowdStrike's routine update the update, designed to bolster defenses against cyber threats, was released without adequate testing. Faulty code within the Falcon sensor software, compatible with Microsoft Windows, is blamed for the disruptions.","Microsoft’s latest tool creates a bootable USB drive that IT admins can use to quickly recover impacted machines.

CrowdStrike said in a blog post that it has identified a list of domains that impersonate CrowdStrike’s brand to attack customers.

CrowdStrike Intelligence

has monitored for malicious activity leveraging the event as a lure theme and received reports that threat actors are conducting the following activity:

Sending

phishing emails

posing as

CrowdStrike support

to customers

Impersonating CrowdStrike staff in phone calls

Posing as independent researchers, claiming to have evidence the technical issue is linked to a cyberattack and offering remediation insights

Selling scripts purporting to automate recovery from the content update issue

Hackers distributing malicious software

A faulty software update from cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike brought widespread chaos last week, rendering approximately 8.5 million Windows devices across critical sectors like healthcare, finance, and aviation, among others useless. While the US-based company later issued an apology and restored services, the prolonged, widespread outage created a prime opportunity for hackers to exploit the situation.CrowdStrike warned people affected by the outage to be wary of malicious activity in which hackers are luring customers by means of emails and phone calls. The company said that the problem was identified and a fix was deployed, hence, people should be wary of communication coming by the company name.“CrowdStrike Intelligence recommends that organisations ensure they are communicating with CrowdStrike representatives through official channels and they adhere to technical guidance the CrowdStrike support teams have provided,” the company added.It noted that some domains may not be “serving malicious content or could be intended to amplify negative sentiment” but they may “support future social-engineering operations.”CrowdStrike said that hackers are distributing a malicious ZIP archive named crowdstrike-hotfix.zip that contains a HijackLoader payload that, when executed, loads RemCos. This may provide the hacker access to your system and personal data.","CrowdStrike warned people affected by the outage to be wary of malicious activity in which hackers are luring customers by means of emails and phone calls.

Karnataka reservation bill: PhonePe CEO and founder Sameer Nigam issues this 'personal statement',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/karnataka-reservation-bill-phonepe-ceo-and-founder-sameer-nigam-issues-this-personal-statement/articleshow/111908948.cms,"Read PhonePe CEO Sameer Nigam’s personal note

“PhonePe was born in Bengaluru and we are incredibly proud of our roots in this city, which is well known for its world-class technology talent and vibrant diversity. From Bengaluru, over the past decade we have expanded across the length and breadth of India and been able to deliver secure and efficient digital payments for over 55 Crore Indians.

Bengaluru's reputation as the ""Silicon valley of India"" is truly well-deserved. The city thrives on an incredible culture of innovation, and attracts the most brilliant young minds from Karnataka and the rest of India. As a company, we are deeply grateful for the supportive business environment that Karnataka’s governments and its local

Kannadiga

populace have offered us. Without such an inclusive ecosystem and progressive policies, Bengaluru would not have become a global technology superpower.

As a company we also thrive on celebrating diversity, we have always tried hard to deliver fair, unbiased and meritocracy-based employment opportunities for all Indians - including to all local Kannadigas. We believe such an approach gives every Indian a good job a chance to shine, and ultimately helps create more societal and economic value for Bengaluru, Karnataka and India.

I read some recent media articles, relating to a few personal comments that I made last week regarding the draft job reservation bill. I would first and foremost like to clarify that it was NEVER my intention to insult Karnataka and it’s people. If my comments hurt anyone’s sentiments in such a way, I am truly sorry and would like to offer you an unconditional apology. I have the highest regard for Kannada, and all other Indian languages. In fact, I truly believe that linguistic diversity and rich cultural heritage is a national asset that all Indians should be proud of; and all Indians should be respectful of and celebrate local and cultural norms.

Bengaluru’s Indian startups are competing against trillion dollar giants like Google, Apple, Amazon and Microsoft. To do so, these companies must be able to employ the very best talent available in India purely based on their technology skills and proficiency in fields such as Coding, Design, Product Management, Data Sciences, Machine Learning, AI and beyond. As a nation, that is the only way we can build world-class companies that can compete in the global village that we live in today.

I also want to help create lakhs of jobs for Bengaluru and Karnataka. And, I believe with more dialogue and discussion, we can find ways to create more sustainable employment avenues. Let’s all work together to do this meaningfully and while creating long-term impact.”

PhonePe CEO Sameer Nigam issued a personal note following backlash over his comments on Karnataka 's job reservation bill. The controversy erupted after Nigam criticised the bill on social media platform X, questioning whether his children deserved jobs in their home city given his company's pan-India job creation.""If my comments hurt anyone's sentiments, I am truly sorry and would like to offer you an unconditional apology,"" Nigam said in a statement.He emphasised his 22-year connection to Bengaluru and respect for linguistic diversity.The Karnataka Cabinet had recently approved a bill mandating 50% reservation for locals in management roles and 70% in non-management positions within private companies. The bill, which also proposed 100% quota for locals in certain government jobs, was put on hold after industry backlash.Nigam stressed the need for merit-based hiring to build globally competitive companies.

How Amazon’s ‘dirty diapers mistake’ killed this multi-million dollar family business,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-amazons-dirty-diapers-mistake-killed-this-multi-million-dollar-family-business/articleshow/111812571.cms,"‘Damaging review’ stayed for years

What Amazon said

A small family business selling washable swim diapers on Amazon was ruined after the e-commerce giant resold a used, faeces-stained diaper to a customer, according to a report from Bloomberg.Paul and Rachelle Baron , owners of Beau & Belle Littles, say their once-thriving company has been devastated by a single one-star review left in 2020. The customer received a diaper ""covered in poop stains"" that Amazon had apparently failed to inspect before reselling as new.The review, which included photos of the soiled diaper, quickly gained traction as other shoppers marked it ""helpful."" This boosted its visibility in the e-commerce platform's algorithm, overshadowing hundreds of positive reviews.""The last four years have been an emotional train wreck,"" Paul Baron told Bloomberg. The couple says they are now $600,000 in debt, barely making enough to pay down loans and order inventory.Amazon's policy requires inspection of all returned items before resale. However, consultants told Bloomberg that selling used products as new is a growing problem on the platform. The sheer volume of returns makes thorough inspection difficult, according to a former Amazon employee.Despite repeated pleas from the Barons, Amazon reportedly refused to remove the damaging review for years. The company finally took it down hours after Bloomberg published its report on Monday.In a statement to Bloomberg, Amazon spokesperson Chris Oster said they have since improved their returns process and updated policies to prevent resale of certain returned products. He called such incidents ""extremely rare.""While Amazon’s marketplace provides small businesses access to millions of customers, the case highlights that sellers have little recourse when things go wrong. Some critics say Amazon's algorithms and review system can amplify isolated incidents, potentially ruining businesses over a single mistake.For the Barons, who once appeared on national television as an Amazon success story, the damage has already been done. They are now seeking additional work to make ends meet.""Amazon talks a big game about helping small businesses,"" Paul Baron said. ""But they really don't.""","Beau & Belle Littles, a small business selling washable swim diapers, was ruined by a single one-star review left in 2020.

Government suspends these two telemarketing companies over sending 5.5 million fraud SMSes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/government-suspends-these-two-telemarketing-companies-over-fraud-smses/articleshow/111823013.cms,"The duo sent over 5mn fraud SMSes since Jan, 2024, DoT claims

What the companies has to say about it?

Amid rising SMS frauds in the country, the department of telecommunications ( DoT ) has suspended operations of two telemarketing companies, namely V-con Intelligent Security and OneXtel Media, reports Economic Times. In its direction dated July 15, the telecom department said that the two misused their platform to send malicious and phishing SMSes, the report states.“In the interest of safeguarding the citizens from cybercrime/financial frauds, all the TSPs (telecom service providers) are directed to: immediately suspend these two RTMs (registered telemarketers )…(and) lodge police complaint against them for misusing DLT platform for sending malicious and phishing SMSes,” read the DoT direction.V-con - a part of the Videocon Group, and OneXtel Media were found responsible for sending 55.5 million fraudulent SMSes to smartphone users since January 2024. DoT’s action comes after receiving several complaints filed by telecom users on the Chakshu portal about malicious SMSes.Quoting officials involved in the investigations, the ET report states that the DoT ordered blacklisting of 131 principal entities (PEs), 5,000 SMS content templates, and 700 SMS headers. However, the fraud senders came up with new headers to cheat the blockchain-based SMS filtering system.The ET report says that it was also found that one among these two entities – V-con and OneXtel – had received money from bank accounts that were involved in multiple complaints of organised transnational crimes, including illegal stock investment frauds.As per the report, OneXtel has strongly opposed the government’s suspension on grounds that the company was not given any opportunity to present its case. Abrar Chunawala, chief executive of OneXtel Media said “We are in cognizance of DoT’s order but also surprised on how the government has casted the burden on a reputed telemarketer like us operating since nine years. It must be noted that we were never intimated about the department’s action, no show-cause notice was served.”“The 55.5 million ballpark figure given in the order, presumably is for 6 months and belongs to two entities. Let’s assume 17 million of these were passed through Onextel. This represents only 0.06% of our total traffic. Is it then fair to suddenly put a company out of business for such a small percentage? As per regulation, it is the responsibility of telecom companies to operate the DLT system. Are they not at fault along with their DLT tech partners?” Chunawala added.",V-con Intelligent Security and OneXtel Media were found responsible for sending 55.5 million fraudulent SMSes to smartphone users since January 2024.

Ashneer Grover , founder of BharatPe and ex-Shark Tank judge recently sat for a podcast interview with YouTuber Ishan Sharma. During the interview, Grover shared his thoughts about the hiring process stating that he does not believe in lengthy hiring process and notice periods. He said that he believes in ‘ hire fast, fire fast ’ rule.When asked about how he hires and manages people, Grover said that he has personally not experienced 100% success in hiring the right candidate.“What I have basically understood about hiring, and a lot of people don’t agree with this thought, it’s hire fast, fire fast,” he said in the podcast.Explaining further, he added “What’s happening currently is that you are investing a lot of time in hiring a person, you go through multiple rounds. The candidate is also, naturally, at his best behaviour. When a candidate comes to sell himself or pitch for himself, then the salesman in him is at its peak. At the end of the day, you will get to know whether he will work or not only after you give him his tasks,”.“Sometimes people are able to sell themselves very well. My realisation is this – we spend 3 months identifying the ideal candidate, then the candidate serves his 2 months of notice period, so we wait for those 2 months. We, at this point, have already invested around 6 months into this role. Once the candidate joins, we want to give him the same amount of time to prove himself. So from 6 months, now it is 1 year.”“After a year, you realise he is not a good fit. I think the best thing to do is to do local optimisation, you decide you need a candidate in a week-15 days, you get him in fast. Judge him on his work faster. And it is very simple to understand who works and who does not. So, hire fast and fire fast,” Grover said in the podcast.","BharatPe founder and ex-Shark Tank judge Ashneer Grover sat for a podcast interview with YouTuber Ishan Sharma.
