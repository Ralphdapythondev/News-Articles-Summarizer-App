Delta Airlines seeks compensation for disruption

In mounting problems for CrowdStrike over Microsoft outage last month, the cybersecurity company being sued by air travellers in a latest move. According to a Reuters report, air travellers whose flights were delayed or cancelled on July 19 due to Microsoft Windows outage on July 19 have filed a class action against the company.The plaintiffs include three fliers who filed the lawsuit in the federal court, Austin, Texas.They blame CrowdStrike's negligence in testing and deploying its software for the outage. Adding further, they stated that as fliers scrambled to get to their destinations, many spent hundreds of dollars on lodging, meals and alternative travel, while others missed work or suffered health problems from having to sleep on the airport floor.The filers demand CrowdStrike to pay compensatory and punitive damages to anyone whose flight was disrupted.In a statement, CrowdStrike said ""We believe this case lacks merit and we will vigorously defend the company.""

Social media outrage on Sarah Sarosh's GRWM video

Sarah Sarosh‚Äôs apology

In the age of social media, influencers wield significant power to shape public opinion. And with this power they also have responsibility not only to the brands they promote but also to their followers', many of whom may trust them blindly. It appears that Sarah Sarosh, a fashion influencer with over 200K followers, forgot this very responsibility.In what can be called a repulsive post, Sarah Sarosh posted a video on the heinous Kolkata murder-rape case where she can be seen smiling and applying make-up.In one-minute-four-second video, which has now been deleted, she is promoting makeup products that she seemingly is endorsing, while a commentary on the brutal rape and murder case runs in the background. The video, criticised for being insensitive and out-of-touch, sparked widespread outrage across various social media platforms. Despite issuing an apology, the incident has ignited a broader conversation about the appropriateness of using certain social media formats to discuss such grave issues.The video in question was part of a ""Get Ready With Me"" (GRWM) series, a popular format where influencers apply makeup while engaging in conversation. In this particular video , Sarah Sarosh appeared cheerful and upbeat as she applied serums, face creams, and makeup, all while a voiceover narrated the harrowing details of a recent crime in Kolkata. The stark contrast between the lighthearted makeup tutorial and the grave subject matter led to an immediate backlash.The video has left users across platforms like Reddit, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram shocked at her insensitivity. One Reddit user commented, ‚ÄúThis is so distasteful and insensitive. She will do anything for views,‚Äù reflecting a common sentiment that the video was made purely for attention, without regard for the gravity of the topic.Another user questioned the decision to pair such serious content with a GRWM format, saying, ‚ÄúAt this point, these people‚Äôs accounts should be banned. If she really had to talk about this topic, she could‚Äôve sat down rather than doing a GRWM. How are the audio and video related?‚ÄùOn X, one of the users labelled the video ‚ÄúAbsolutely disgusting,‚Äù while another user lamented the lengths some influencers will go for likes, stating, ‚ÄúLooks like there‚Äôs no end to how low they can go for likes. Nothing is off limits. No basic human decency is required.‚ÄùIn response to the backlash, Sarah Sarosh took to Instagram Stories to issue a public apology. She explained that her intent had been to raise awareness about the crime while also addressing her beauty content, which she had already filmed months earlier. ‚ÄúI posted a GRWM reel yesterday which was shot 2 months ago with a voiceover on the current affairs of the rape & murder incident,‚Äù she wrote. Sarosh admitted that she did not realise how ‚Äútone deaf‚Äù the video would appear, acknowledging that the mismatch between the content of the video and the subject of the voiceover was a grave error.Sarosh also shared her immediate reaction upon receiving negative comments, revealing that she deleted the video within five minutes of posting it. ‚ÄúThe comments made me realise instantly that the messaging is distasteful from my end,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI deeply apologise for my actions to all those who have come across the content through screen recordings of my deleted content being circulated on other platforms.‚Äù","Sarah Sarosh, a fashion influencer with over 200K followers, posted a video on the heinous Kolkata murder-rape case where she can be seen smiling and applying make-up.

The new offering promises lightning-fast 8-16 minute deliveries for a diverse range of products, spanning from groceries to electronics.With this move, Flipkart directly challenges established players in the booming quick commerce sector, including Swiggy's Instamart, Zomato's Blinkit , Zepto , and BigBasket's BB Now.The service, which was previously offered on a trial basis to employees at Flipkart's headquarters, is now available to users through the Flipkart app.We confirmed the service's availability by checking an address in HSR on the Flipkart app, which indeed showed Flipkart Minutes as an option for quick delivery. Additionally, several users on X (formerly Twitter) reported that Flipkart is delivering groceries and other items to their addresses in Bengaluru within minutes through the ""Minutes"" service.Sources familiar with the matter tell the Economic Times that Flipkart plans to expand the service to more areas in Bengaluru over the next few weeks.The launch of Flipkart Minutes comes at a time when other players in the quick commerce space are aggressively expanding their operations.The ET had earlier reported that Flipkart was planning to operate around 100 dark stores to bolster its quick-commerce offerings during the upcoming festive season. Dark stores, which are mini warehouses strategically located for rapid deliveries, have become a crucial component of quick commerce operations.Blinkit, for instance, recently announced ambitious plans to increase its dark store count to 2,000 by 2026. This doubles down on its earlier announced plans to have 1,000 dark stores by March 2025. Similarly, Zepto aims to double its network to 700 dark stores by March 2025. Swiggy Instamart , another major player, currently operates more than 500 such warehouses.Interestingly, Amazon, a key player in the e-commerce space, has not shown interest in the quick-commerce business in India so far. However, it does operate a grocery store service dubbed "" Amazon Fresh ,"" offering same-day delivery for groceries. This is similar to what Flipkart has also been offering through its Grocery tab.","Flipkart has launched its quick commerce service'Flipkart Minutes'in select areas of Bengaluru.

What doctor said

An Apple Watch user is crediting the smartwatch for saving his life after the wearable alerted him about a life-threatening condition. Peter Moore , a resident of Montecito, California shared his experience with a local news publisher KTLA. Narrating the incident, he said ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt be here if it wasn‚Äôt for this little device‚Äù.Moore, who is a former tech executive, said that he was on his way to the airport when he began to feel ‚Äúa little lightheaded and a little faint‚Äù.‚ÄúLike a typical male, I thought, ‚ÄòI‚Äôll go to Starbucks. That‚Äôll fix it,'‚Äù Moore explained before he received a notification from the Apple Watch he was wearing.‚ÄúMy phone started to ping and said ‚Äòlow heart rate,‚Äô which I‚Äôd never seen before. And so I looked at it‚Ä¶ my heart rate had dropped to 32. And it was insistent in its notifications that something wasn‚Äôt right,‚Äù said Moore. He then contacted his wife who took him to hospital.‚ÄúThe doctor kind of theatrically ran in and said, ‚ÄòThis is not good. This is not good. You need a pacemaker right now,'‚Äù Moore said.Omid Yousefian, the cardiac electrophysiologist at Sansum Clinic Cardiology who treated Moore said ‚ÄúYes, his watch had a big role in saving his life‚Äù.‚ÄúThese days, 25% of the population over the age of 40 ‚Ä¶ have a high chance of experiencing atrial fibrillation,‚Äù Yousefian explained.‚ÄúFor us physicians, symptoms are the most important thing.

What exactly happened

Read the complete post here

In a shocking incident, a Supreme Court lawyer, Mukul P Unny , was scammed out of Rs 38,000 while attempting to exchange his iPhone 13 for an iPhone 15 on Amazon .in. The lawyer detailed his ordeal on social media, highlighting the fraudulent tactics employed by the delivery executive.Unny took X (formerly known as Twitter) to post about the new kind of smartphone exchange scam.The incident occurred on July 21, 2024, when Unny placed an order for the iPhone 15 on Amazon. The following day, a delivery executive arrived at his residence and handed over the new phone after receiving the necessary OTP. However, the executive then requested another OTP, claiming it was required to complete the exchange.Despite Unny's hesitation, he was convinced to return the new iPhone to the delivery executive after speaking to the latter's supervisor.Unny contacted Amazon customer care the following day to report the incident. Initially, Amazon assured him of a refund if the product was not delivered. However, subsequent inquiries revealed the case was under investigation with a resolution deadline of July 31.On July 31st, Amazon concluded its investigation and informed Unny that a refund was impossible. The company's explanation lacked substance, as they had not thoroughly verified the scam details. The fact that Unny still possessed his old iPhone directly contradicted Amazon's claim that the exchange was complete.While Amazon has eventually issued a refund to Unny, his ordeal underscores the considerable risks inherent in online transactions, even when dealing with reputable platforms like Amazon.Always verify the identity of a delivery executive before sharing your Amazon OTP. This crucial step can protect you from falling victim to scams.‚ÄúThis is the story of my worst experience with @amazonIN On 21.07.2024, I ordered iPhone 15 from Amazon in exchange for my iPhone 13. On 22.07.2024, the delivery executive came at around 930 PM. I gave the OTP and took the product, and gave my phone to the executive.He said I have give another OTP. I had already given the OTP and was wondering what other OTP is to be given for exchange. I said I dont have any other OTP than the one I have given. He stayed there for few minutes & then called his supervisor.After speaking with the supervisor, the delivery exec asked for return of the product since the ""exchange is not final"".I insisted that I speak with the supervisor. The supervisor tells me that the exchange is done by a different team & requests for the product to be returned. I said I cannot give away the product especially since the OTP is given and the app was showing that the product is delivered. But this supervisor Ashok (8076650306) requested me to return, lest his team will have to make for the loss.Upon his request and assurance that the product will be ""reattempted"" the next day, I gave the product to the delivery exec (Vishal 8826421956) after taking the supervisor's and the delivery exec's number. On 23.07.2024, I spoke with the Amazon Customer Care and raised a complaint to which I assured that refund will be initiated if the product is not delivered. Call centre asked me to follow up on 25.07.2024.On 26.07.2024,when I called them, the customer case asked me to wait till 31.05.2024 as ""it has to be investigated"". Today, when I call Amazon, they said ""investigation"" is complete and that refund cannot be initiated. No fact-finding was done by Amazon in this. Now, we are staring at a loss of Rs. 38000 and a possible scam done by supervisor, delivery exec and others at Amazon. If they say that the exchange is done, then they can very well see the old phone that I still use with me.This could happen to any one of you and please be aware while dealing with @amazonIN.‚Äù","Supreme Court lawyer Mukul P Unny was scammed out of Rs 38,000 while attempting to exchange his iPhone 13 for an iPhone 15 on Amazon.in.
