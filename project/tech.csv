A Delhi woman was recently held under ‘digital house arrest’ by scammers posing as CBI officials . The accused demanded money from her claiming her husband has been arrested in a rape case, reports PTI.The incident took place in north east Delhi in early August. The PTI report quotes Deputy Commissioner of Police (Northeast) Joy Tirkey who said “A complaint was received from an NDMC employee that his wife received a call from an unknown number and the callers introduced themselves as officials from the CBI Crime Branch,”.The three scamsters — Raju Ray (29), Guddu Kumar Sharma (29), and Pappu Kumar (22) — all residents of Bihar, have been arrested, it added.As per the report, the victim received a call from the scammers informing her about the arrest of her husband in a rape case. They demanded Rs 2 lakh for releasing him and further threatened her to publicise the matter in case of non-payment.Fearing the loss, the woman allegedly transferred Rs 2 lakh to two bank accounts provided by the fraudsters. The DCP said that the scammers did not allow her to disconnect the phone call for about six hours.A case has been registered against the accused. Based on intelligence and technical surveillance, raids were conducted in different parts of Bihar and the trio were nabbed, the officer said.Digital arrest is a tactic used by cybercriminals these days where they confine victims to their homes in order to scam them. The fraudsters generally pose as law enforcement officers and use artificial intelligence (AI)-generated voices to dupe citizens.Some of the tips to stay safe are:",Three people have been arrested in connection with a phone scam. The callers claimed to be from the CBI and demanded money from the victim. The victim was forced to hand over the money to the fraudsters.

Apple iPhone SE (rumoured name iPhone SE 4 ) is reported to be the next ‘affordable’ iPhone. While the Cupertino-based tech company is set to bring the iPhone 16 series in September, iPhone SE (fourth gen) may launch early next year, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman has claimed.Gurman says that iPhone 16 may not bring ‘meaningful bumps’ for those using the latest models, but people with older models will see ‘nice upgrades’ in the series.He shares that there will be a similar story with those using the current generation iPhone SE.“..next year is certain to bring a bigger shake-up to the iPhone line. As early as the beginning of 2025, Apple will launch a new iPhone SE — the first upgrade to its low-end phone since 2022,” Gurman said in his weekly Power On newsletter.Gurman says that not only will the phone launch in early 2025, it will have a major design change and look like an iPhone 14 “with a crisper OLED display that stretches across the full device.” Previous reports claimed the phone will have FacelD, notch and its screen may measure 6.1 inches – up from 4.7 inches.Rumours also say that Apple is planning to keep the backplate manufacturing process for the rumoured iPhone SE 4 'exactly the same' as the standard model in Apple's upcoming iPhone 16 lineup.

How this 'China ban' may be behind e-SIMs not becoming 'popular' in India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-this-china-ban-may-be-behind-e-sims-not-becoming-popular-in-india/articleshow/112449382.cms,"When Airtel CEO 'batted' for e-SIMs

The adoption rate of virtual SIMs or eSIMs in India has been rather slow -- for both retail and enterprise users -- despite the advantages they offer. According to industry experts, this is primarily attributed to a Chinese government policy that has discouraged its use. The three biggest telecom operators in India -- Airtel, Reliance Jio and Vodafone-Idea -- have supported e-SIM features almost for years now.Apple launched the first e-SIM-enabled phones in 2018. The iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max and iPhone XR were the first phones to support e-SIM and since then all iPhone have supported e-SIM features. Google's Pixel phones too support the e-Sim feature from 2019.While top-tier smartphone brands like Google, Apple and Samsung offer eSIM support in almost all their premium models, the adoption of the same in smartphones from Chinese companies like Xiaomi , Vivo , Oppo , OnePlus and Realme has been almost negligible. This is same for their high-end, medium as well as low-end models. Across the portfolio, these brands have been notably slow in adoption of e-SIMs.Here according to a report in Economic Times, a big reason is that there's a reluctance to extend this feature to affordable smartphones among Chinese smartphone brands. This is because China, a crucial market and the home country of these brands, has strict regulations on e-SIMs due to security concerns. It is not clear if there is an explicit ban, but even Apple, which is the first company to support e-SIMs, does not sell iPhones with e-SIMs in China mainland.Consequently, manufacturers are hesitant to incur additional costs for eSIM compatibility in devices meant for the Indian market, where cost-effectiveness is a major factor.Telcos, on the other hand, are keen on promoting eSIM adoption in the affordable segment as it can lead to cost reductions. Also, call quality is widely regarded to be better in phones with e-SIM. Earlier this year, citing the benefits of using virtual SIMs, Gopal Vittal, CEO, Airtel, had urged the telco’s large user base to shift from physical eSIMs saying, “In these times of digital-first lifestyles, where mobiles, tablets and watches are all interconnected, the e-SIM will provide seamless connectivity for you.”“For instance, you will be able to go for a morning jog and not carry your phone along since the e-SIM will enable connectivity on your smartwatch while your phone sits by your bedside at home and you enjoy your run,” Vittal wrote to the subscribers.However, as of December 2023, only about 10-15% of smartphones sold in India supported eSIMs, with Counterpoint Research predicting a gradual increase to 20% over the next five years. This is in stark contrast to the US, where eSIM penetration has reached 70%. In fact, the iPhone 15 series models launched in the US do not support physical SIM.Industry experts believe that as costs associated with eSIM technology decrease and the supply chain matures, more smartphone manufacturers will be inclined to adopt eSIMs in their affordable models. This shift would bring several benefits to both telcos and consumers, including cost savings, enhanced security, and greater flexibility.While the potential of eSIMs is undeniable, the road to widespread adoption in India is likely to be gradual, influenced by factors such as government policies, consumer awareness, and technological advancements.","The adoption rate of virtual SIMs or eSIMs in India has been rather slow.

Just weeks after a software update caused widespread IT chaos, cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike has taken an unusual approach to damage control. Instead of shying away from the spotlight, the company's president, Michael Sentonas , boldly accepted the ""Most Epic Fail"" award at the Pwnie Awards .Just to refresh a bit of memory, on July 19 some of the biggest airlines, banks and other essential services in many parts of the world came to a standstill as a massive outage rippled across the globe.The outage, which has brought the Blue Screen of Death upon thousands of Windows machines across the globe, is linked to one software company: CrowdStrike. As of July 19, CrowdStrike’s valuation was upwards of $83 billion; it has come down to just under $60 billion post the outage.Coming back to the awards, the unexpected win came on the heels of a high-profile presence at Black Hat , where CrowdStrike had a major booth and distributed free merchandise. The company's message to attendees, according to a spokesperson, was one of gratitude and appreciation for the community.Sentonas' acceptance speech, shared widely online, was met with surprising enthusiasm. The Pwnie Awards audience, much like the Black Hat attendees, seemed willing to give CrowdStrike a second chance. The award itself was a last-minute addition, a humorous acknowledgment of the company's recent blunder.Accepting the comically large trophy, Sentonas admitted the error but emphasized the company’s commitment to learning from its mistakes. He pledged to display the award prominently at CrowdStrike headquarters as a constant reminder of the importance of protecting users.The company's public response has been seen as a bold strategy to rebuild trust and transparency. By owning up to the failure in such a public manner, CrowdStrike aims to demonstrate its commitment to accountability and improvement.","CrowdStrike president Michael Sentonas accepted the ""Most Epic Fail"" award at the Pwnie Awards.

Women comprise a significant portion of India's tech workforce, yet they remain underrepresented in executive roles, with a significant gender gap in AI leadership compared to global counterparts, a recent report claims.According to a report by Nasscom and Boston Consulting Group (BCG), increasing women's participation in the workforce is crucial for fostering ethical AI outcomes as the adoption of generative AI grows.However, while generative AI has the potential to level the playing field for women in tech , only 35% of surveyed women feel fully supported by their employers, creating challenges in adoption. Here are some of the key findings of the report:90% of women see GenAI as crucial for career growth, however, they lack the readiness to use these tools as only 35% feel prepared/equipped to use the technology.Female representation in tech in India reduces from 43% at entry levels to 4-8% at executive levels, which is well below the global average of 14%.Adoption of GenAI among Indian professionals is high at 80%, while mid and junior-level women are already using GenAI. Meanwhile, Male professionals in AI/GenAI are approximately 46% higher than female professionals in India.65% of both women and men in India believe that GenAI will act as an equaliser for women’s inclusion in tech. GenAI could help bridge the gender gap by creating new opportunities, enhancing accessibility, and reducing biases that have traditionally hindered women’s progress in tech, the report adds.Senior women are close with 79%, however, they trail senior men in GenAI adoption rates in India, unlike their global counterparts.72% of women highlighted using Gen AI for improving efficiency and time management, while 51% of women said they use Gen AI for fostering innovation and creativity.Limited knowledge, lack of trust, restricted access and fear of competence scrutiny are the perceived barriers to accelerating adoption, the report noted.The report adds that the global AI market is expected to reach $320-380 billion by 2027, growing at a CAGR of 25-35%, with GenAI poised to dominate 33% of this landscape.","Women comprise a significant portion of India's tech workforce, yet they remain underrepresented in executive roles.

"Reliance Jio, Airtel and Vodafone-Idea 'unhappy' with Trai's new QoS rules; say overlook ground realities",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/reliance-jio-airtel-and-vodafone-idea-unhappy-with-trais-new-qos-rules-say-overlook-ground-realities/articleshow/112268723.cms,"COAI statement

COAI’s member Telecom Service Providers (TSPs) have consistently invested in enhancing Quality of Service (QoS) through significant improvements in network infrastructure, resulting in greater stability and reliability. The industry has embraced advanced technologies and automation tools, including predictive maintenance and AI-driven analytics, to proactively address network issues. Moreover, major initiatives are underway to fiberize towers across India, which is a crucial step for the efficient deployment of 5G services.

While TRAI has tightened the QoS benchmarks over the years, the ground realities remain unchanged. TSPs still grapple with Right of Way (RoW) issues when acquiring permissions for infrastructure deployment in public and private land for the installation of cell towers and fiber-optic cables. The situation is further aggravated due to additional requirement of street furniture for the 5G networks. Moreover, interference from various sources, such as other wireless devices and electromagnetic interference, degrade signal quality and network performance. Further, illegal boosters and repeaters used by unauthorised agents, as well as the cases of theft of equipment are also external factors which, nevertheless, impact the QoS. Besides, frequent takedown of the overhead fiber by the authorities have a significant impact in QoS as well. TSPs have limited control over these external sources which adversely impact the Quality of Services.

Despite these challenges, TSPs have consistently met TRAI's QoS benchmarks. The industry expresses concern over the proposed regulations, which not only tighten benchmarks but also shift from quarterly to monthly reporting and site to cell level reporting in many cases. In fact, the QoS parameters prescribed in the new Regulations have not been introduced by any other regulator in other similar economies. These changes are expected to significantly increase the compliance as well as the cost burden on telecom operators, and without commensurate benefits for the customers.

While we are disappointed with the stringency of these new regulations, we remain committed to engaging constructively with TRAI on QoS-related matters. Our member organizations will continue to strive for excellence in service quality while advocating for regulations that recognize the practical challenges faced by our industry.

What are the new QoS rules

The telecom industry has raised concerns over stringent new quality of service (QoS) norms introduced by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India ( TRAI ). The Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), representing major telecom players -- Reliance Jio , Airtel and Vodafone-Idea -- argues that the regulations impose excessive burdens without addressing the challenges operators face on the ground.The new rules mandate stricter service quality benchmarks, increased penalties for non-compliance, and more frequent reporting requirements. Telecom operators must now compensate subscribers for outages exceeding 24 hours at the district level and face penalties of up to Rs 10 lakh for violations.However, COAI contends that these measures are impractical given ongoing hurdles such as right-of-way (RoW) issues for infrastructure deployment, interference from unauthorized devices, and theft of equipment. The industry body also highlights the impact of frequent fiber cuts and the additional demands of 5G network rollout. Despite these challenges, telecom operators have consistently met Trai's QoS benchmarks , according to COAI. The industry is seeking a more realistic approach that acknowledges the operational difficulties and avoids placing undue financial pressure on operators.Trai has issued new quality of service (QoS) rules, making it mandatory for telecom operators to compensate subscribers in case of service outages for more than 24 hours at a district level. Trai has also increased the penal amount to Rs 1 lakh from Rs 50,000 for failing to meet each quality benchmark under the new rules.The telecom regulator has introduced a graded penalty system of Rs 1 lakh, Rs 2 lakh, Rs 5 lakh and Rs 10 lakh for different scales of rule violations and submitting false report under revised regulations -- ""The Standards of Quality of Service of Access (Wirelines and Wireless) and Broadband (Wireline and Wireless) Service Regulations, 2024"".Trai has provided a six-month grace period for operators to align their systems with the new regulations.","The Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), representing major telecom players -- Reliance Jio, Airtel and Vodafone-Idea -- argues that the regulations impose excessive burdens.

How to identify Amazon OTP scam

Meanwhile, if you are a victim of cybercrime, register your complaint with the National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal at https://cybercrime.gov.in/ or call 1930.

Amazon Great Freedom Festival sale is here and as shoppers flock to the e-commerce platform for shopping, scammers are also gearing up to capitalise on the increased online activity. One common tactic employed by fraudsters is the OTP scam. Numerous individuals have fallen victim to this scheme in the past, prompting Amazon to issue warnings to its customers.Since people usually spend thousands of their hard-earned money, it becomes crucial to remain vigilant and protect personal information during this sale period, especially from scammers requesting sign-in OTP via phone calls.In a communication shared with customers recently, Amazon said that scammers are adopting multiple tactics to defraud unsuspecting shoppers. A growing number of individuals have reported receiving phone calls from individuals posing as Amazon customer service representatives or delivery agents. These scammers aim to steal personal information, including login credentials, by manipulating victims into revealing sensitive data.Scammers often try to create a sense of urgency, stating that there has been an unexpected order or delivery which may not have been placed by a potential victim. The scammers will then ask for a sign-in One-Time Password (OTP) to cancel the delivery.A confused ‘customer’ then shares the OTP thinking that he/ she has averted the hassle of package delivery, however in reality, the scammer has gained access to the account. Shoppers must note that Amazon will never ask its customers to share their account sign-in OTP or passcode, especially over the phone to avoid being scammed.“If you receive communication — a call, text, or email — that you think may not be from Amazon, please report it to us at, amazon.in/reportascam,” it said.Last year, Amazon India and the Uttar Pradesh Police joined hands to fight fraud and protect online shoppers from bad actors. They launched a consumer education and awareness campaign named #MissionGraHAQ.","Amazon Great Freedom Festival sale is here and as shoppers flock to the e-commerce platform for shopping, scammers are gearing up to capitalise on the increased online activity.

This marks the first time the DGGI has issued such a notice to a cryptocurrency firm, setting a significant precedent in India’s efforts to regulate the rapidly growing virtual currency market.Sources confirmed that the notice was issued to Binance for collecting fees from Indian customers trading in virtual digital assets (VDAs) on their platform, categorized under online information database access or retrieval (OIDAR) services.Earlier this year, Binance received approval from India’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) to register as a virtual asset service provider (VASP). However, the company was slapped with a Rs 18 crore penalty from the FIU last month for non-compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) regulations.Despite being a major player in the global cryptocurrency market, with at least 40% market share and operations across more than 150 countries, Binance had not registered under the Indian GST framework. This oversight has now brought the company under the scrutiny of Indian tax authorities.“Binance reportedly earned at least Rs 4,000 crore from transaction fees charged to Indian customers. The company has a user base of 90 million users globally, including a substantial number of customers from India too. Detailed investigation revealed that the earnings of these fees were credited to the account of a Binance Group Company — Nest Services Limited — based in Seychelles,” a top source privy to the development said.In fact, Binance is reportedly facing a trial in a Nigerian court for alleged tax evasion, following a crypto crackdown in the country.To make Binance compliant with the GST regulations, DGGI Ahmedabad zonal unit also sent emails to Binance group companies in Seychelles, the Cayman Islands and Switzerland, which did not elicit a response. Binance appointed a local counsel in India to liaise with the DGGI, marking the first step towards resolving this significant tax compliance issue.Sources confirmed that DGGI is also closely monitoring financial transactions and activities of online gaming platforms and marketplaces for the possibility of tax evasion.The Indian GST regime mandates that foreign service providers pay GST for services provided to Indian residents, particularly under the OIDAR category. As the investigation continues, other cryptocurrency exchanges operating both overseas and within India are also expected to face scrutiny from tax authorities, said sources.","The Ahmedabad zonal unit of the Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGGI) has issued a show cause notice to Binance.

Additionally, several users on X (formerly Twitter) reported that Flipkart is delivering groceries and other items to their addresses in Bengaluru within minutes through the ""Minutes"" service.Sources familiar with the matter tell the Economic Times that Flipkart plans to expand the service to more areas in Bengaluru over the next few weeks.The launch of Flipkart Minutes comes at a time when other players in the quick commerce space are aggressively expanding their operations.The ET had earlier reported that Flipkart was planning to operate around 100 dark stores to bolster its quick-commerce offerings during the upcoming festive season. Dark stores, which are mini warehouses strategically located for rapid deliveries, have become a crucial component of quick commerce operations.Blinkit, for instance, recently announced ambitious plans to increase its dark store count to 2,000 by 2026. This doubles down on its earlier announced plans to have 1,000 dark stores by March 2025. Similarly, Zepto aims to double its network to 700 dark stores by March 2025. Swiggy Instamart , another major player, currently operates more than 500 such warehouses.Interestingly, Amazon, a key player in the e-commerce space, has not shown interest in the quick-commerce business in India so far.

What doctor said

An Apple Watch user is crediting the smartwatch for saving his life after the wearable alerted him about a life-threatening condition. Peter Moore , a resident of Montecito, California shared his experience with a local news publisher KTLA. Narrating the incident, he said “I wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for this little device”.Moore, who is a former tech executive, said that he was on his way to the airport when he began to feel “a little lightheaded and a little faint”.“Like a typical male, I thought, ‘I’ll go to Starbucks. That’ll fix it,'” Moore explained before he received a notification from the Apple Watch he was wearing.“My phone started to ping and said ‘low heart rate,’ which I’d never seen before. And so I looked at it… my heart rate had dropped to 32. And it was insistent in its notifications that something wasn’t right,” said Moore. He then contacted his wife who took him to hospital.“The doctor kind of theatrically ran in and said, ‘This is not good. This is not good. You need a pacemaker right now,'” Moore said.Omid Yousefian, the cardiac electrophysiologist at Sansum Clinic Cardiology who treated Moore said “Yes, his watch had a big role in saving his life”.“These days, 25% of the population over the age of 40 … have a high chance of experiencing atrial fibrillation,” Yousefian explained.“For us physicians, symptoms are the most important thing. [Moore] was notified by his watch that his heart rate is slow and he correlated that with the symptoms that he had. So he didn’t wait. He didn’t sit. He came to the hospital directly. So he made a very smart move,” Yousefian told the publication.","Peter Moore, a former tech executive, was on his way to the airport when he began to feel “a little lightheaded and a little faint” He received a notification from the Apple Watch he was wearing that his heart rate had dropped to 32.

What exactly happened

Read the complete post here

In a shocking incident, a Supreme Court lawyer, Mukul P Unny , was scammed out of Rs 38,000 while attempting to exchange his iPhone 13 for an iPhone 15 on Amazon .in. The lawyer detailed his ordeal on social media, highlighting the fraudulent tactics employed by the delivery executive.Unny took X (formerly known as Twitter) to post about the new kind of smartphone exchange scam.The incident occurred on July 21, 2024, when Unny placed an order for the iPhone 15 on Amazon. The following day, a delivery executive arrived at his residence and handed over the new phone after receiving the necessary OTP. However, the executive then requested another OTP, claiming it was required to complete the exchange.Despite Unny's hesitation, he was convinced to return the new iPhone to the delivery executive after speaking to the latter's supervisor.Unny contacted Amazon customer care the following day to report the incident. Initially, Amazon assured him of a refund if the product was not delivered. However, subsequent inquiries revealed the case was under investigation with a resolution deadline of July 31.On July 31st, Amazon concluded its investigation and informed Unny that a refund was impossible. The company's explanation lacked substance, as they had not thoroughly verified the scam details. The fact that Unny still possessed his old iPhone directly contradicted Amazon's claim that the exchange was complete.While Amazon has eventually issued a refund to Unny, his ordeal underscores the considerable risks inherent in online transactions, even when dealing with reputable platforms like Amazon.Always verify the identity of a delivery executive before sharing your Amazon OTP. This crucial step can protect you from falling victim to scams.“This is the story of my worst experience with @amazonIN On 21.07.2024, I ordered iPhone 15 from Amazon in exchange for my iPhone 13. On 22.07.2024, the delivery executive came at around 930 PM. I gave the OTP and took the product, and gave my phone to the executive.He said I have give another OTP. I had already given the OTP and was wondering what other OTP is to be given for exchange. I said I dont have any other OTP than the one I have given. He stayed there for few minutes & then called his supervisor.After speaking with the supervisor, the delivery exec asked for return of the product since the ""exchange is not final"".I insisted that I speak with the supervisor. The supervisor tells me that the exchange is done by a different team & requests for the product to be returned. I said I cannot give away the product especially since the OTP is given and the app was showing that the product is delivered. But this supervisor Ashok (8076650306) requested me to return, lest his team will have to make for the loss.Upon his request and assurance that the product will be ""reattempted"" the next day, I gave the product to the delivery exec (Vishal 8826421956) after taking the supervisor's and the delivery exec's number. On 23.07.2024, I spoke with the Amazon Customer Care and raised a complaint to which I assured that refund will be initiated if the product is not delivered. Call centre asked me to follow up on 25.07.2024.On 26.07.2024,when I called them, the customer case asked me to wait till 31.05.2024 as ""it has to be investigated"". Today, when I call Amazon, they said ""investigation"" is complete and that refund cannot be initiated. No fact-finding was done by Amazon in this. Now, we are staring at a loss of Rs. 38000 and a possible scam done by supervisor, delivery exec and others at Amazon. If they say that the exchange is done, then they can very well see the old phone that I still use with me.This could happen to any one of you and please be aware while dealing with @amazonIN.”","Supreme Court lawyer Mukul P Unny was scammed out of Rs 38,000 while attempting to exchange his iPhone 13 for an iPhone 15 on Amazon.in. The lawyer detailed his ordeal on social media, highlighting the fraudulent tactics employed by the delivery executive. Amazon has eventually issued a refund to Unny.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112307192,imgsize-126698,width-400,resizemode-4/112307192.jpg"
