‘Founder mode’ and not ‘manager mode’: Why this startup guru want tech CEOs to change the way they work,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/founder-mode-and-not-manager-mode-why-this-startup-guru-want-tech-ceos-to-change-the-way-they-work/articleshow/113035801.cms,"“Founder mode” vs “manager mode”

Steve Jobs, Jensen Huang, and others who are leading their companies in “founder mode”

Y Combinator co-founder Paul Graham has ignited a debate in Silicon Valley with a provocative essay challenging long-held beliefs about startup management. The piece, published Sunday, argues that conventional wisdom on scaling companies is fundamentally flawed and introduces the concept of ""founder mode"" as an alternative to traditional ""manager mode.""Graham's essay was inspired by a recent talk from Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky , who described how following standard advice led to ""disastrous"" results at his company.""As Airbnb grew, well-meaning people advised him that he had to run the company in a certain way for it to scale,"" Graham wrote. ""Their advice could be optimistically summarised as 'hire good people and give them room to do their jobs.' He followed this advice and the results were disastrous.""The crux of Graham's argument is that founders are often given advice suited for professional managers, not company creators. ""What they were being told was how to run a company you hadn't founded—how to run a company if you're merely a professional manager,"" he explained. ""But this m.o. is so much less effective that to founders it feels broken.""Graham contends that the standard ""manager mode"" approach, which emphasises delegation and avoiding micromanagement, often leads to dire consequences. ""What this often means is to hire professional fakers and let them drive the company into the ground,"" he wrote bluntly.Instead, Graham advocates for a ""founder mode"" of leadership, though he admits its exact principles are still being defined. He predicts it will involve more direct engagement between CEOs and employees at all levels. ""Whatever founder mode consists of, it's pretty clear that it's going to break the principle that the CEO should engage with the company only via his or her direct reports,"" Graham wrote. ""'Skip-level' meetings will become the norm instead of a practice so unusual that there's a name for it.""The essay resonates strongly with Chesky's recent comments on leadership. In a TED talk, Chesky described feeling ""gaslit"" by advisors and employees urging traditional management approaches. ""I felt like I was going crazy,"" Chesky said. ""Everyone was telling me to do things that felt wrong, and when I did them, they didn't work.""Graham echoes this sentiment, writing, ""Founders feel like they're being gaslit. VCs who haven't been founders themselves don't know how founders should run companies, and C-level execs, as a class, include some of the most skillful liars in the world."" Steve Jobs , whose approach Chesky studied, is often cited as a prime example. Other notable practitioners that have been talked about are Jensen Huang of Nvidia, who reportedly maintains 60 direct reports;; Mark Zuckerberg of Meta; and Sam Altman of OpenAI.Outside the tech sector, Howard Schultz, who built Starbucks into a global powerhouse, is also mentioned as embodying this hands-on leadership style.Dan Rose, a former executive at Amazon and Meta, added to the list, noting that "" Jeff Bezos and Zuckerberg were both micro-managers, deep in the details of the product and business. They never set expectations of autonomy, and they fired anyone who resisted their oversight.""“Worth reading,” reacts Elon Musk , Shopify CEO and others approve of Graham’s idea of “founder mode,” while some still want to stick with “manager mode’The essay has sparked intense debate in startup circles. Serial entrepreneur Howard Lerman posted that founders were ""absolutely fired up"" by Graham's ideas, adding: ""Building a company is all I know how to do, and all I ever want to do.""Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk endorsed Graham's essay as ""worth reading"" on social media platform X. Shopify CEO Tobias Lütke also expressed approval of the approach.However, not everyone in the tech world is fully convinced. Jessica Lessin, founder of The Information, pointed out that even highly involved founders like Jobs relied on skilled managers such as Tim Cook to oversee crucial aspects of their businesses, suggesting a more nuanced approach might be necessary.Graham concludes his essay with a bold prediction: ""Once we figure out what [founder mode] is, we'll find that a number of individual founders were already most of the way there—except that in doing what they did they were regarded by many as eccentric or worse.""","Y Combinator co-founder Paul Graham argues that conventional wisdom on scaling companies is flawed.

It has mandated Access Providers to immediately stop promotional voice calls from unregistered senders or telemarketers using SIP, PRI, or other telecom resources,” the telecom regulator said.“Any UTM found to be misusing these resources will face severe consequences, including disconnection of all telecom resources for up to two years and blacklisting,” the TRAI statement added.The regulator recently granted a one-month extension to access service providers to comply with its direction regarding the whitelisting of URLs, APKs and OTT links.

The airlines seeks compensation of up to $500 million from both Crowdstrike and Microsoft, as disclosed in the company’s filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) According to TechCrunch, Delta has hired high-profile attorney David Boies to represent its interests in the case against CrowdStrike. The airline alleges that the faulty update amounted to gross negligence or willful misconduct, potentially voiding contractual limits on damages typically included in enterprise software agreements.Shareholders, who owned the company shares until July 29, have also taken legal action, filing a class action lawsuit against CrowdStrike. They claim the company misled them regarding its software update procedures, raising questions about CrowdStrike's transparency and risk management practices.In response to the mounting legal challenges, CrowdStrike has enlisted the services of Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, a prominent law firm, to defend against the expected barrage of litigation. This move underscores the seriousness of the situation and the potential financial implications for the cybersecurity company.The individual lawsuits currently being filed may eventually be consolidated into a class action suit to streamline the legal process.

In the early hours of the morning, a devastating fire severely damaged the Church of the Immaculate Conception in Saint-Omer, France. This historic 19th-century church, known for its exquisite neo-Gothic architecture, suffered extensive damage as the blaze engulfed the building, leading to the collapse of its iconic steeple and bell tower. The fire, which required the efforts of over 90 firefighters to control, has left the community in shock.Fortunately, no injuries were reported, but the loss to this architectural gem is immense.The Church of the Immaculate Conception, completed in the late 1800s, is celebrated for its neo-Gothic design, which includes soaring spires, intricate stone carvings, and stunning stained glass windows. The church has long been a symbol of Saint-Omer's rich cultural and religious heritage. Its towering steeple and bell tower were among its most distinctive features, drawing visitors and worshippers alike. The destruction of these elements marks a significant loss for both the local community and architectural enthusiasts worldwide.The news of the fire quickly spread, catching the attention of many, including tech billionaire Elon Musk. Musk, known for his active presence on social media, reacted by sharing a video of the burning church on his platform X (formerly Twitter). In his post, Musk raised the question of whether the fire could have been an act of arson, sparking widespread discussion and speculation online. His post has garnered significant attention, with many users engaging in the debate over the possible causes of the fire.Following the incident, France’s Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin expressed his condolences to the Catholics and residents of Saint-Omer, acknowledging the profound loss to the community. He assured the public that a thorough investigation is underway to determine the cause of the fire. While no official statement has been made regarding the possibility of arson, the investigation will explore all potential leads to uncover the truth behind this tragic event.The fire at the Church of the Immaculate Conception has left the residents of Saint-Omer grappling with the loss of a beloved landmark. The church has not only been a place of worship but also a cornerstone of the town's identity. In the aftermath of the fire, the local community has rallied together, expressing their grief and support for efforts to rebuild and restore the church.As the investigation continues, there is hope that the cause of the fire will be determined, allowing the community to begin the healing process. Whether the fire was a tragic accident or the result of foul play, the loss of such an important cultural and religious site is deeply felt. The future of the Church of the Immaculate Conception remains uncertain, but the resolve of the Saint-Omer community to preserve their heritage is clear.In the days to come, the focus will likely shift to recovery and rebuilding efforts, with the possibility of international support for the restoration of this historic site. The church’s significance extends beyond its religious role, representing a link to the past and a beacon of architectural beauty that has inspired many. The world will be watching closely as the investigation unfolds and as the people of Saint-Omer work to restore what has been lost.","A fire destroyed the Church of the Immaculate Conception in Saint-Omer, France.

Pavel Durov, CEO of Telegram , has recently become the subject of widespread speculation after older photos of him resurfaced online. These images have led many to wonder whether the billionaire entrepreneur underwent plastic surgery to enhance his appearance. Adding to the intrigue, Durov was recently arrested in France, raising further questions about the man behind the popular messaging app.Pavel Durov, a 39-year-old entrepreneur originally from Russia, is best known as the founder and CEO of Telegram, a messaging app launched in 2013.Telegram quickly gained popularity for its strong emphasis on user privacy, offering end-to-end encryption and other security features that set it apart from competitors. As of now, Forbes estimates Durov's net worth to be around $15.5 billion. Despite his success in the tech industry, Durov has managed to maintain a relatively low profile—until now.Durov's recent arrest in Paris has added a new layer of complexity to his public image. He was detained in France on charges of suspected complicity in running an online platform involved in illicit activities, including child exploitation, drug trafficking, and fraud. While these allegations are serious, it is the sudden focus on Durov's physical transformation that has captured the internet's attention.Pavel Durov has been active on social media platforms like Instagram since 2011, regularly sharing photos from his travels around the world. In his recent posts, Durov appears with a full head of hair and a toned physique, often posing shirtless in various locations. However, these recent images stand in stark contrast to older photos where Durov was seen with a noticeably receding hairline.The drastic change in his appearance has fueled rumours that Durov may have undergone plastic surgery, including a possible hair transplant. A popular post on X (formerly Twitter) by a well-known account shared a side-by-side comparison of Durov's old and new photos, sparking a flurry of online discussions. The post reads, ""Pavel Durov (Telegram CEO) before his hair transplant and plastic surgery,"" and has since gone viral.The speculation around Durov's transformation has been met with a variety of opinions online. On Reddit, users have debated whether the changes in Durov's appearance are the result of surgical procedures or simply better grooming and styling.One Reddit user commented, ""This isn't a hair transplant. His hair is too thick and full to have this kind of drastic change from a HT. Most likely he's wearing a hair system (wig).""Another user added, ""There's speculation that it's not a transplant, but rather a hair system because his hair loss was much more advanced in the first picture, so when the operation happens, the resulting hairdo never looks as full as his.""Some users believe the changes are the result of plastic surgery, with one theorising, ""This is well-done surgery.""However, not everyone is convinced that surgery is involved. One Reddit user opined, ""Honestly, I think a lot of the facial 'changes' are simply due to the much better angle and lighting in the second photo.""As the speculation continues, it's clear that Durov's transformation—whether natural or assisted—has caught the public's eye. The intense scrutiny of his appearance highlights the challenges that come with being in the spotlight, especially for someone as private as Durov. Whether or not he has undergone any procedures, the discussions around his looks reflect a broader societal fascination with image and success.","Pavel Durov, 39, is the founder and CEO of Telegram, a messaging app launched in 2013.

Elon Musk praised Ratan Tata

The legacy of the Tata Nano

In the realm of business and innovation, few figures command as much respect as Tata Group chairman emeritus Ratan Tata. His influence extends far beyond the Indian corporate world, even garnering admiration from Tesla CEO Elon Musk . In a 2009 interview with American journalist Charlie Rose , Musk praised Ratan Tata as a ""gentleman and a scholar."" This moment has recently resurfaced, shedding light on Musk's appreciation for Ratan Tata and his ambitious project, the Tata Nano .The Tata Nano was introduced by Tata Motors in 2008 as the world's cheapest car, with a price tag of just Rs 1 lakh (approximately $2,300 at the time). The car was a pet project of Ratan Tata, designed to make automobile ownership accessible to millions of Indians who had never been able to afford a car. The idea was revolutionary—a small, affordable car that would cater to the vast Indian middle class, providing them with a safe and efficient means of transportation.In the interview with Charlie Rose, which took place shortly after the launch of the Tata Nano, the Tesla CEO was asked about his views on Ratan Tata’s efforts to introduce a low-cost car in India. The interview clip, which has recently gone viral, captures Musk's candid response.""Take for a moment Ratan Tata, what he’s doing in India — developing a little sedan for $2300. Where do you put that in the whole equation of where the future of cars is?"" asked Rose.Musk responded with a mix of admiration and caution. He began by acknowledging the brilliance behind the Tata Nano project and the character of Ratan Tata himself.""I think it's a good idea to have affordable cars, but I think the problem with something like the Nano ... I wouldn't say problem because I think, by the way, it is probably a great idea and Ratan is a gentleman and scholar,"" Musk said.However, Musk also expressed his concerns about the long-term viability of such a low-cost vehicle, particularly in the context of rising fuel prices. He pointed out that while the initial purchase cost of the Nano was remarkably low, the cost of running the car—particularly fuel costs—could become a significant issue as gasoline prices continued to rise.""But where it’s going to become challenging in the future is when the price of gasoline rises, the cost of acquiring the car is much less of an issue than the cost of running the car,"" the billionnaire explained.Despite the initial excitement surrounding the Tata Nano, the car faced numerous challenges. One of the most significant issues was its branding. While the Nano was intended to be an affordable vehicle for the masses, it was often labeled as ""cheap"" rather than ""affordable."" This perception problem, combined with safety concerns and competition from other small cars, led to unimpressive sales figures.The Nano’s production was ultimately discontinued in 2018, marking the end of what was initially seen as a groundbreaking project. The car's journey from inception to discontinuation is often cited as one of the biggest marketing failures in the automobile industry.","The Tata Nano was introduced by Tata Motors in 2008 as the world's cheapest car, with a price tag of just Rs 1 lakh (approximately $2,300 at the time) The car was a pet project of Ratan Tata, designed to make automobile ownership accessible to millions of Indians who had never been able to afford a car.
