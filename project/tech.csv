Why Google employees are now less worried about being beaten by ChatGPT maker OpenAI in AI race,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-google-employees-are-now-less-worried-about-being-beaten-by-chatgpt-maker-openai-in-ai-race/articleshow/113882781.cms,"Google taking cautious approach in launching AI products

The launch of OpenAI ’s ChatGPT , a conversational AI chatbot, reportedly led CEO Sundar Pichai to declare a “code red” and redirect teams to focus on AI development . However, this seems to have changed over time with search giant’s employees feeling more confident about keeping up in the AI race , as per a report.According to a report by Bloomberg, after ChatGPT’s launch, some investors were of concern that the chatbot has the potential to disrupt Google's search engine business.Google, however, took measures to regain its lead, including merging its premier research labs to form the Google DeepMind unit and fortifying relationships between researchers and product teams.Citing a person familiar with the matter, a similar situation arose when OpenAI unveiled its o1 model, known internally as Strawberry, in mid-September. It said that some people in Google DeepMind have got worried that the company had fallen behind.However, a larger chunk of employees are no longer said to be as concerned as they were following the launch of ChatGPT because Google has debuted some of its own work, the person told the publication.Despite Google facing pressure to compete in the rapidly evolving field of AI, the company is taking a more deliberate approach to releasing AI products, the report said. This reflects Google's cautious strategy to address ethical concerns, maintaining public trust, “and the competing interests of multiple similar efforts in the vast organisation”.Despite this measured pace, Google remains a major force in AI, said Oren Etzioni, an AI researcher who founded TrueMedia.org nonprofit dedicated to combating political disinformation.“Technically it’s always been the case that Google’s capabilities were top notch. They were just more conservative in rolling things out. It’s a marathon, and it’s anybody’s race to win,” Etzioni was quoted as saying.In fact, Pichai has also emphasised that the advancement in AI development has been mistaken with a competitive Al race.“While some have tried to reduce this moment to just a competitive Al race, we see it as so much more than that,” Pichai said in an article he penned for The Financial Times.“At Google, we've been bringing Al into our products and services for over a decade and making them available to our users. We care deeply about this. Yet, what matters even more is the race to build Al responsibly and make sure that as a society we get it right,” he added.","ChatGPT launch reportedly led CEO Sundar Pichai to declare a ‘code red’ and redirect teams to focus on AI development.

ChatGPT maker OpenAI closes funding round; becomes third-largest startup in the world with investment from these companies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/chatgpt-maker-openai-closes-funding-round-becomes-third-largest-startup-in-the-world-with-investment-from-these-companies/articleshow/113883836.cms,"Microsoft and Nvidia among biggest investors

Apple stays away

Funding comes after management flux

ChatGPT maker OpenAI has successfully raised $6.6 billion from investors, bringing its post-money valuation to $157 billion. This significant funding round solidifies OpenAI’s position as one of the world’s most valuable private companies.OpenAI’s rapid rise in product popularity and valuation has captivated global attention. Since launching ChatGPT, it has attracted 250 million weekly active users.The company’s valuation soared from $14 billion in 2021 to $157 billion, with revenue growing from zero to $3.6 billion, surpassing Altman’s initial projections. According to Bloomberg, investors in the new round can reclaim their investment if OpenAI doesn’t complete its conversion to a for-profit entity within two years.The investment was spearheaded by Thrive Capital, led by Josh Kushner, with contributions from Khosla Ventures, Altimeter Capital, and Fidelity Management & Research Company. Notable backers include Microsoft Corp., which has already invested $13 billion in OpenAI, and Nvidia Corp., whose processors are crucial to the AI industry. Global investors such as SoftBank Group Corp. and the new Abu Dhabi-based tech investment firm MGX also participated.Apple Inc did not participate in this funding round, despite previous discussions. The iPhone maker has a partnership with OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT into its devices and Siri voice assistant. Plans for Apple to gain a board observer role were dropped, according to sources familiar with the matter. Reports suggest that Apple left the deal table at the last moment.This funding round aligns with OpenAI’s ongoing restructuring and executive changes. Recently, longtime Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati, Chief Research Officer Bob McGrew, and Research VP Barret Zoph resigned. Of the original 13 founders from 2015, only three remain.The funds were raised through convertible notes, contingent on OpenAI’s transition to a for-profit structure, removing the non-profit board’s control and lifting the cap on investor returns.Despite the executive changes, investor enthusiasm remains high, driven by growth projections from CEO Sam Altman and CFO Sarah Friar. OpenAI is expected to generate $3.6 billion in revenue this year, despite losses exceeding $5 billion, with a projected revenue jump to $11.6 billion next year.Investors have secured protections during OpenAI’s complex restructuring, which includes granting equity to Altman. Negotiations are ongoing, with no set timeline. Terms allow investors to reclaim their capital or renegotiate the valuation if changes aren’t implemented within two years.","ChatGPT maker OpenAI has successfully raised $6.6 billion from investors, bringing its post-money valuation to $157 billion.

"New TRAI rule on spam messages comes into effect: What it means for Jio, Airtel, and Vodafone Idea users",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/new-trai-rule-on-spam-messages-comes-into-effect-what-it-means-for-jio-airtel-and-vodafone-idea-users/articleshow/113876559.cms,"What is TRAI’s new mandate for commercial messages

What it means for Jio, Airtel, and Vodafone Idea users

The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India ’s ( TRAI ) new regulations to combat spam and fraudulent messages have come into effect. Companies sending commercial texts must now register their content with telecom providers, including website links, app links, and file attachments before they are disseminated to customers.The information is then verified through a secure system and only messages with verified content are delivered, while unverified messages are blocked.This process, called Whitelisting, aims to protect consumers from scams and unwanted messages.According to TRAI’s new mandate, starting October 1 (previously September 1), all commercial messages containing web links, app links, and file attachments must be pre-approved. This means businesses sending such messages have to register their content with telecom providers. If these messages aren't registered, telecom operators will block them.Many entities might not have pushed their messages if the URLs were not whitelisted because such messages would have been blocked by the telecom operators, an official told The Economic Times.“The entities are in the process of whitelisting and in the coming days, things will streamline,” the official added. To make this process easier, TRAI clarified that only the fixed part of web addresses needs to be registered, not the dynamic parts that might change.Meanwhile, the telecom giants have also tuned their blockchain-based distributed ledger technology (DLT) platform to recognize and allow messages with registered web addresses.Citing industry data, ET said that these measures aim to address the massive volume of commercial messages sent in India, estimated at 1.5 to 1.7 billion per day – about 55 billion per month. TRAI's regulations ensure that only authorised entities can send promotional messages to consumers.All types of commercial messages, including one-time passwords, promotional offers, and account updates, must now be sent through this secure platform.To further enhance accountability, TRAI has mandated that the entire path of a message, from sender to recipient, must be traceable starting November 1. Any message that cannot be fully traced will be rejected. This measure aims to combat spam and fraudulent messages, improving the overall messaging experience for consumers.With the new mandates, Jio Airtel , and Vodafone Idea users can expect fewer spam and fraudulent text messages. The new regulations also enhance security by requiring all commercial messages to be sent through a secure platform. This helps protect your personal information and reduces the risk of phishing attacks.The messages that users will receive are expected to be more trustworthy, as businesses must now verify their content with telecom providers. This helps ensure that the links and attachments that users receive are legitimate.","Telecom Regulatory Authority of India’s ( TRAI ) new regulations to combat spam and fraudulent messages have come into effect.

"Pokemon Scarlet and Violet players may soon face a new 7-star Tera Raid boss, here's what to expect",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/gaming/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-players-may-soon-face-a-new-7-star-tera-raid-boss-heres-what-to-expect/articleshow/113806334.cms,"Infernape Tera Raid boss: Expected start date, time and more



Take a look at the post here



Pokemon Scarlet and Violet players may face a new fiery challenge in early October as Infernape, the popular fourth-generation Fire-type starter, takes over Seven-Star Tera Raid dens. Infernape is a significantly tougher opponent than the previous Serperior. It is known for its high speed and powerful attacks and will reportedly replace Serperior the Unrivaled as the next formidable Tera Raid boss.While possessing a versatile move set and impressive offensive stats, trainers should be wary of its low HP and susceptibility to Water, Flying, and Ground-type attacks.According to a report by Serebii.net, the fighting against Infernape the Unrivaled will commence on Thursday, October 3 at 8:00 pm EST (5.30 am IST) and continue until Sunday, October 6 at 7:59 pm EST (5.29 IST). A second opportunity to face this challenging foe will be available the following week, from October 10 to 13 at the same time.In a post on social media platform X (earlier Twitter), Serebii.net shares all the details.Players can acquire Infernape in Pokemon Scarlet and Violet by catching a Chimchar in the Terarium's Polar Biome and evolving it. Prepare your teams and strategies to face this challenging opponent in the upcoming Tera Raids. The Infernape will boast the Rock-type as its Tera type and will reward successful trainers with the coveted Mightiest Mark.Just like previous Tera Raid bosses, Infernape the Unrivaled, will possess its Hidden Ability,Iron Fist , which will significantly amplify the power of its punching moves. Therefore, trainers should anticipate facing attacks like Mach Punch, Fire Punch, and Thunder Punch.Additionally, Infernape will utilise its Rock Tera type with moves such as Stone Edge or Rock Slide, potentially combining them with disruptive tactics like Taunt and Swords Dance. Despite the defensive nature of Rock-type Pokemon, Infernape's inherent fragility leaves it open to attacks from Water, Ground, and Fighting types.Trainers are advised to prepare their teams and strategies carefully to overcome this formidable opponent. Also, trainers preparing to challenge Infernape the Unrivaled should prioritise building teams with strong defences to withstand its powerful punches.","Pokemon Scarlet and Violet players may face a new fiery challenge in early October.

iPhone 15 scam: How a Bengaluru man caught fake Flipkart delivery man,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/social/iphone-15-scam-how-a-bengaluru-man-caught-fake-flipkart-delivery-man/articleshow/113840201.cms,"Take a look at the post here

Image credit: Reddit

A Bengaluru resident has exposed a delivery scam attempt. This scam involved a fake Flipkart delivery man who tried to deliver a fake package disguised as an iPhone 15. The resident, who had ordered an iPhone 15 with 256GB storage and opted for an open-box delivery , claims that a man dressed in a white t-shirt posed as a Flipkart delivery executive and attempted to hand over a sealed package.To prevent customers from receiving damaged or incorrect items, online retailers like Amazon and Flipkart often offer an ""open-box delivery"" option for high-value purchases. This allows customers to inspect the product before accepting the delivery, ensuring they receive exactly what they ordered. The imposter reportedly pressured the resident to accept the package without inspection, but fled the scene when the resident started recording the interaction.In the post, he wrote: “My sister bought an iPhone 15 with VIP on the Flipkart sale, it was an open box delivery. This loser (a guy in white) came with a big package to deliver claiming that he couldn't do an ‘open box delivery’. We have to accept it as is. I refused. He called some random people and they said there was no facility like that. He was scared shitless because I recorded all this. Telling his partners in crime in Kannada that I have recorded everything and all. I did not accept the package. Within two minutes another guy came to deliver a very small package and said that he would open the box before delivering it. We got the product because I recorded everything, otherwise I am sure he would have given me some random package.”At the end of the post also shared the pictures of the delivery executives . Here’s is the one who the customer flagged as a fake one:How users reacted to this postThe Reddit post got a lot of significant attention as it sparked a wave of users sharing similar concerns about trustworthiness and scams on online marketplaces . Many recounted their own experiences of receiving damaged, incorrect, or even empty packages despite opting for open-box deliveries.In the comments section, one user wrote: “Nice bro. Glad you knew something was off and recorded everything. It's very hard to trust Flipkart now. Their association with an insane amount of scammers in all delivery pipelines is really scary. It's really disturbing you know that Flipkart can't do or doesn't do anything about the scamming happening during the delivery.”Meanwhile, another user noted: “Just yesterday I received a laptop. Did an open box check, and even waited for the initial irritating Windows setup and upgrade to complete, to check that the processor and other details are as expected.In the past, Amazon sent me a laptop with a gen 4 i5 processor, instead of a gen 8, that I had ordered. And my stupid ass realised it after a year, when I ran some benchmarks.The Flipkart guy was obviously in a hurry, as I was clearly taking more time than I should have. (In my defence, I couldn't accept a 90k laptop, without being sure that it was the correct one)I finally have him 200 rupees, and then he was more than happy to wait for 45 minutes. He went ahead and made 2-3 more deliveries, then came back and took the OTP from me.I made a 40 minute long video, from the moment on unboxing, till verifying everything.The only reason I order costlier items from Flipkart and not Amazon, is for open box deliveries. If they do any drama in that, they can take it back.”",A Bengaluru resident has exposed a delivery scam attempt.

OnePlus issues a statement

OnePlus places high value on intellectual property rights and fair access to standard essential patents, which is essential for driving innovation in the industry. We will continue to negotiate with InterDigital and wish to solve this matter in an amicable way. Meanwhile, our commitment in Europe remains unchanged and we will continue to provide excellent products and services to our users.

OnePlus smartphones have been banned from sale in Germany, marking a significant setback for the popular mobile brand. The ban follows a legal dispute over patent issues , forcing the company to halt sales in the country. For those unaware, OnePlus returned to the German market earlier this year in January after a patent dispute with Nokia . In response, OnePlus has issued a statement addressing the situation, assuring users that existing devices will continue to receive support while they work on resolving the matter.The latest ban comes after a legal dispute over patent issues between OnePlus and InterDigital - a research and development company focused on wireless devices.The dispute concerns key patents for 5G and other mobile technologies.As a result of the dispute, OnePlus phones have been temporarily removed from its German online store. However, other devices, including the OnePlus Pad 2 and OnePlus Watch 2, remain available for purchase on the website.Speaking to Allround-PC, OnePlus explains:As mentioned above, OnePlus returned to Germany in January, 2024 after a gap of two years. Nokia then filed two lawsuits against Oppo and OnePlus accusing them of using patented Nokia technology without having valid licenses in its devices. In 2020, a Mannheim Regional Court ruled in favour of Nokia, resulting in the ban of Oppo and OnePlus phones in the country.","OnePlus smartphones have been banned from sale in Germany.

A retired Brigadier from Panchkula, Haryana, lost aRs 4.2 crore after falling victim to a cyber fraud . According to a report by The Indian Express, the victim received an app link via a WhatsApp message. The message promoted a stock market scheme that offered high return on investments. Trusting the credibility of the message, the retired officer downloaded the app.Consequently, he lost Rs 4.2 crore on the pretext of investing in the stock market.The scam started when the retired officer downloaded an app from a link he received on WhatsApp. The report said that the victim was persuaded by fraudsters to invest in stock market schemes by giving him lucrative offers.Initially, he invested around Rs 1 crore, believing in the authenticity of the scheme. He then involved his wife in the investments, eventually transferring a total of Rs 4.2 crore across multiple accounts provided by the scammers. To make it seem legitimate, the fraudsters maintained continuous communication and provided constant updates.However, when the victim attempted to withdraw his funds, the fraudsters demanded an additional commission of Rs 65 lakh to process the withdrawal. Realizing something was amiss, the victim quickly understood he had been scammed and reported the incident to the Haryana Cyber Crime Police .Consequently, authorities launched an investigation and discovered that the scam was part of a larger, international fraud network . The masterminds, based in the U.S. and U.K., had been running a highly coordinated operation. They laundered the stolen funds using bank accounts of individuals in rural border villages of India, who were paid small commissions ranging from Rs 4,000 to Rs 10,000 for each Rs 1 lakh transferred.","A retired Brigadier from Panchkula, Haryana, lost aRs 4.2 crore after falling victim to a cyber fraud.

Average daily transactions exceeded Rs 68,800 crore.



Value of UPI transactions remain above Rs 20 lakh crore for 5 months

PhonePe led the market in August

UPI payments in India achieved a new milestone, surging to Rs 20.64 lakh crore in value in the month of September. Developed by National Payments Corporation of India ( NPCI ), Unified Payments Interface (UPI) transactions increased to 15.04 billion (1,504 crore) in September, a growth of 42 per cent year-on-year, the data shows.The NPCI data shows that the average daily transaction amount stood at 501 million (up from 483 million in August) and average daily transaction amount reached Rs 68,800 crore (from Rs 66,475 crore in August).In terms of value, UPI payments increased to Rs 20.64 lakhs, a 31 per cent YoY growth.As per the NPCI data, the value of UPI transactions processed has remained above Rs 20 lakh crore for five consecutive months.In September, Aadhaar Enabled Payment System (AePS) transactions once again surpassed 100 million, with a total transaction value of Rs 24,143 crore. Immediate Payment Service (IMPS) transfers, on the other hand, amounted to Rs 5.65 lakh crore, reflecting an 11% year-on-year (YoY) growth. On average, 14 million transactions were processed daily, with a daily transaction value of Rs 18,841 crore.Meanwhile, NETC FASTag recorded 318 million transactions, a 7% increase for the month, generating Rs 5,620 crore—a 10% YoY growth. The average daily transaction volume stood at 11 million, with Rs 187 crore collected each day, according to NPCI data.In August, Walmart-owned PhonePe dominated UPI payments with more than 48% market share. It was followed by Google and Paytm . While the app-wise data for the month of September is yet to be published, the NPCI and government earlier proposed a 30% market share cap in the UP segment. This is aimed to prevent market concentration and reduce the risk of duopoly.","In September, UPI payments in India reached a record Rs 20.64 lakh crore with 15.04 billion transactions, marking a 42% YoY growth.

“We’re living through a technological paradigm shift. In a few short years, our computers have learnt to speak our languages, to see what we see and hear what we hear.

Yet technology for its own sake counts for nothing. What matters is how it feels to people and what impact it has on societies. It’s about how it changes lives, opens doors, expands minds, and relieves pressure. It is perhaps the greatest amplifier of human well-being in history, one of the most effective ways to create tangible and lasting benefits for billions of people.

And yet technology is, and must always remain, in service to humanity: an enabler, a path to deepening our common bonds and shared understanding, our energy and imagination, our creativity and capacity for everything from invention to forming relationships.

In the field of AI, we often get caught up in the technical details. We spend our time talking about parameters and compute. The focus is on training runs, data centres and the latest techniques. This is natural and inevitable when operating on the frontiers of something new, where the details do really matter. But I think it’s important that in doing all of this, getting stuck right into the technical weeds, that we don’t lose sight, not just of what we are building, but why we are building it.

At Microsoft AI, we are creating an AI companion for everyone.

I truly believe we can create a calmer, more helpful and supportive era of technology, quite unlike anything we’ve seen before. Great technology experiences are about how you feel, not what’s under the hood. It should be about what you experience, not what we are building.

Copilot will be there for you, in your corner, by your side, and always strongly aligned with your interests. It understands the context of your life while safeguarding your privacy, data, and security, remembering the details that are most helpful in any situation. It gives you access to a universe of knowledge, simplifying, and decluttering the daily barrage of information, and offering support and encouragement when you want it.

Over time it’ll adapt to your mannerisms and develop capabilities built around your preferences and needs. We are not creating a static tool so much as establishing a dynamic, emergent, and evolving interaction. It will provide you with unwavering support to help you show up the way you really want in your everyday life, a new means of facilitating human connections and accomplishments alike.

With your permission, Copilot will ultimately be able to act on your behalf, smoothing life’s complexities and giving you more time to focus on what matters to you. It will be an advocate for you in many of life’s most important moments. It’ll accompany you to that doctor’s appointment, taking notes and following up at the right time. It’ll share the load of planning and preparing for your child’s birthday party. And it’ll be there at the end of the day to help you think through a tricky life decision.

Some people worry that AI will diminish what makes us unique as humans. My life’s work has been to ensure it does precisely the opposite. We choose what we create. This is something we must do together. Our task is to ensure it always enriches people’s lives and strengthens our bonds with others, whilst supporting our uniqueness and endlessly complex humanity.

This is a new era of technology that doesn’t just “solve problems”, it’s there to support you, teach you, help you. In this sense, Copilots really are different to that last wave of the web and mobile. This is the beginning of a fundamental shift in what’s possible for all of us. It’s a long journey that will take years. With our latest updates to Copilot, you are seeing only the first careful steps in this direction.

Patience and care with our deployments are at the very foundation of our approach. My commitment is to be accountable at every stage, to work with you and listen to you. Respect and deep compassion for our users and for society is the core purpose behind everything we do. It comes first. This is a journey we promise to take together. I couldn’t be more excited to embark on it with you.

Amazon and Dell calls employees back to office full time

While tech giants like Amazon and Dell are calling employees back to the office full-time (5-days-a-week), Microsoft is taking a different approach. The company has announced that it will not require employees to return to the office unless their productivity drops, according to a report.Citing discussions in an internal meeting, Business Insider reported that Microsoft notes that this policy may change if employee productivity declines.This comes after the tech giant pitched hybrid work as a way to boost productivity and retain employees.According to two employees who were present, the announcement was made by Scott Guthrie, the executive vice president of Microsoft's cloud and AI group.Microsoft allows employees to work from home and sees it as a way to not only retain employees but also increase their productivity.“If you make the time to do it right, your employees will be more engaged, more productive, and more connected, even when they're miles away,” Keith Boyd, a Microsoft IT senior director, wrote in an August post about the hybrid-work approach.“And they'll be far less likely to leave for a competitor who has a more sophisticated and flexible model than you do,” Boyd added.Amazon and Dell are two tech companies that have recently mandated employees to work in the office five days a week.

Tesla has adopted a controversial strategy to combat rising absenteeism at its Berlin gigafactory, according to a report by The Telegraph. The electric car manufacturer has started making home visits to employees who have called in sick, an unusual and controversial move aimed at addressing a growing problem at the facility.The absenteeism rate at Tesla’s Berlin gigafactory has seen a significant increase in recent months.In August 2024, around 17% of the facility's workforce reported being sick, a stark contrast to the 5% average absenteeism in the broader German car industry. This prompted Tesla to take action. The Berlin facility, which employs approximately 12,000 workers, has become a critical component of Tesla’s European operations, and maintaining efficiency is a priority for the company.In an effort to curb absenteeism, Tesla management began conducting home visits to employees who had called in sick. The factory manager, André Thierig, explained that the goal was to ""appeal to the work ethic of the workforce."" As part of the company’s broader strategy to encourage attendance, Tesla also introduced a €1,000 (£830) bonus for employees who maintain more than 95% attendance.The carmaking union IG Metall has pushed back against Tesla’s approach, arguing that the high rate of absenteeism is a symptom of overwork and unsafe working conditions at the Berlin gigafactory. According to the union, employees are struggling with the intense workload and the physical demands of their roles.Thierig, however, disputed this claim, stating that the rise in absenteeism is not indicative of poor working conditions, as the working environment remains consistent across all shifts. Instead, he suggested that the high absenteeism could be partly due to exploitation of the German social system, hinting that some workers might be taking advantage of the system.Elon Musk , Tesla's CEO, has a history of clashing with unions, and this situation in Germany highlights ongoing tensions. Thierig, reflecting the company’s tough stance on absenteeism, stated last year that Tesla would not tolerate workers who take advantage of their colleagues by skipping work without valid reasons. “There is no room in this factory for people who don’t get out of bed in the morning,” Thierig said, signaling that Tesla would take strong measures to ensure productivity.Tesla’s home visit policy has sparked mixed reactions among the workforce. While the company views it as a necessary step to reduce absenteeism and maintain operational efficiency, not all employees are on board. Reports have surfaced of staff members reacting negatively to the visits, with some reportedly slamming doors in the faces of Tesla representatives or threatening to call the police.","Tesla has adopted a controversial strategy to combat rising absenteeism at its Berlin gigafactory.

Elon Musk lost legal battle over unpaid severance to former Twitter employee,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/elon-musk-lost-legal-battle-over-unpaid-severance-to-former-twitter-employee/articleshow/113852856.cms,"Elon Musk vs Ex-Twitter employee: Background on the case

Broader legal context

Musk's X facing legal troubles in Brazil

Also read

Elon Musk has recently lost a legal case involving unpaid severance to a former Twitter (now rebranded as X) employee who was laid off after Musk's acquisition of the company in 2022. As per reports, this legal ruling could significantly impact more than 2,000 ex-employees who have similar severance complaints following their layoffs after Musk's purchase of Twitter.The dispute arose after Elon Musk purchased Twitter for $44 billion in 2022, resulting in the mass layoff of over half of the company’s workforce.Former employees claimed they did not receive the proper severance pay they were owed after being terminated. These complaints have now culminated in various legal actions. One former employee took the case to arbitration, which led to a favourable ruling for the worker.The arbitration decision is a crucial development in the ongoing legal battles. Shannon Liss-Riordan, the attorney representing the former employees, stated that the arbitrator awarded full severance to her client. While arbitration proceedings are private, the ruling signals a significant victory for laid-off workers seeking compensation. Liss-Riordan expressed optimism about the potential for more favourable rulings, hoping that this decision would encourage Twitter/X to negotiate settlements for all affected employees.This case is not Musk's first legal challenge surrounding severance pay. In July, Musk's company won a separate lawsuit involving claims that it owed $500 million in severance to around 6,000 employees under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). While Musk’s company prevailed in that case, the recent arbitration ruling suggests that the legal battles are far from over, with 15 other cases having already gone through arbitration, and more expected to follow.In addition to severance disputes, Musk’s X platform faces separate legal challenges in Brazil. The Brazilian Supreme Court recently ordered the suspension of X’s services in the country, threatening a daily fine of over $900,000 if the company failed to comply. The court’s actions stem from X’s violation of a previous ban imposed by the court in August. X briefly restored access, which the Brazilian government deemed a violation of the court order. The court criticised X for ""unlawfully, persistently, and intentionally"" defying judicial orders and instructed the country's telecommunications agency, Anatel, to enforce the platform's suspension.Following the court's orders, X appointed a new legal representative, Rachel de Oliveira Conceicao, to comply with Brazilian laws. The company had previously lost its legal standing in the country after closing its offices in August, leading to the court’s decision to suspend X's services.","Elon Musk has lost a legal case involving unpaid severance to a former Twitter employee.

How govt has warned users against fake e-notices sent over email



iQOO India CEO, Nipun Marya , has issued a warning about a prevalent email scam targeting users across the country. In a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), Marya shared a screenshot of a fraudulent email falsely claiming to be from him. The email, riddled with grammatical errors and misspellings, attempts to deceive recipients by asking for a favour and requesting they refrain from calling as he is ""in a meeting.""The screenshot shared on X shows that mail was sent from Marya to a user named Siddhartha.However, the email ID from which it was sent -loiir56@dingtalk.com - looks shady and doesn’t seem to be associated with the CEO of iQoo India. This suggests that the mail wasn’t sent by Marya but by some scammer.In the mail body, the scammer wrote:Marya used the social media platform to warn users about such unsolicited emails and encourage vigilance, particularly when the messages contain threats or demands. This serves as a reminder to be cautious and verify the authenticity of emails before engaging or responding, especially those that seem suspicious or unusual.In July, the Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C), a unit under the Ministry of Home Affairs , warned citizens about a new wave of ""fake emails"" disguised as government e-notices. The I4C issued a public advisory urging individuals to be vigilant and verify the authenticity of any e-notice received via email. These fraudulent emails often mimic official government communications and may contain threats or demands to deceive recipients.To curb the rising threat of fake government e-notices, the I4C also outlined several countermeasures to help citizens protect themselves. The unit asked users to verify the sender's email address and ensure it ends with ""gov.in.""Secondly, the I4C also suggested users conduct online research to confirm the legitimacy of any officials mentioned in the email.Finally, the advisory also asked users to contact the relevant government department directly to verify the email's authenticity. With these simple steps, individuals can avoid falling victim to these deceptive scams.","iQOO India CEO, Nipun Marya, has issued a warning about a prevalent email scam.

His post causes “a stir”

Oh man, my last post about firing created quite a stir …

… and I want to clarify some things:

To me, it is important to be transparent and openly talk about “taboos” like firing.

In said post, I tried to catch your attention by using a more serious photo and a rather controversial opening. Among many positive reactions, there were also a few concerned messages.

Unfortunately, this eclipsed the actual message behind my words: Firing is just as important as hiring.

Let me share some numbers:

𝗜𝗻 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗹𝗮𝘀𝘁 𝟭𝟮 𝗺𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗵𝘀, 𝘄𝗲 𝗵𝗮𝗱 𝗮 𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗻𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗿 𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝗼𝗳 𝗷𝘂𝘀𝘁 𝟱%—we had to let go 2 people because of work attitude and cultural fit. Standard literature and industry stats suggest that the usual turnover rate in IT is about 10-15%, sometimes even higher.

This shows us that we do a very good job at:

→ Hiring

→ onboarding people

→ caring for team wellbeing and

→ team development (including ongoing situational feedback).

𝗪𝗲 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗮 𝗽𝗲𝗼𝗽𝗹𝗲-𝗳𝗶𝗿𝘀𝘁 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗮𝗻𝘆.

We know that without the right people, we won’t achieve our goals.

𝗣𝗿𝗼𝘁𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝘀 𝗰𝘂𝗹𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗯𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗼𝗳 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘁𝗲𝗮𝗺 𝘁𝗼 𝗮𝗰𝗵𝗶𝗲𝘃𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗴𝗼𝗮𝗹𝘀, 𝗶𝘀 𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗽𝗿𝗶𝗼𝗿𝗶𝘁𝘆 #𝟭. To do that, we sometimes (and fortunately not often!) have to let someone go. And if we do, we do it in the most respectful way.

𝗟𝗲𝘁𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘀𝗼𝗺𝗲𝗼𝗻𝗲 𝗴𝗼 𝗶𝘀 𝗻𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗿 𝗲𝗮𝘀𝘆 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗻𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗿 𝘄𝗶𝗹𝗹 𝗯𝗲.

But it is a necessity and the better we are prepared, the better it is for the affected team members, the rest of the team, the hiring team, and the company culture.

And that’s why I believe we should talk about it more.

The CEO of a tech company recently shared a post on LinkedIn, saying that he is “really good at firing people” and that laying off employees is as important as hiring them. The post created a stir online with him claiming that he received concerned messages from his team. The CEO has now written another post clarifying the meaning of his post.Journi CEO Andreas Roettl said in the LinkedIn post that his company trains its team leaders “to become good at letting people go.”“I am really good at firing people..says no one ever.But we should! Because firing is as important as hiring. Yet it is a topic most people avoid. We don’t want to be fired, we don’t want to fire others,” he added in the post.However, he also said that just like it happens in “soccer” (football), the employees must be given a chance to improve by giving them a “clear first warning: the yellow card, so to speak.”After his post, Roettl revealed that he “got some concerned msg from my team that this could potentially harm our hiring efforts or not be seen so positive by our current team members”.He apologised for the post but highlighted that “the main message is that we have to praise and protect all of you guys doing a great job at Journi.” He wrote a separate post clarifying his stance saying that it is important to be transparent and openly talk about firing.

Spotify CEO Daniel Ek revealed that he refuses to play sports with his longtime friend, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg , due to their fiercely competitive natures. In a recent interview on the Acquired podcast , Ek said, ""The rule I have with Mark is I don't try to go into a competition with him because I know it'll end badly for both of us.""Ek and Zuckerberg's friendship dates back to 2008 when they met at a barbecue hosted by early Facebook and Spotify investor Sean Parker .Since then, the two tech giants have maintained a close relationship, with Ek learning valuable leadership lessons from Zuckerberg along the way.Despite their strong bond, Ek draws the line at engaging in sports with the Meta founder. He cited an incident where Zuckerberg tore his ACL during MMA training last year rather than conceding defeat. ""The last time he sort of tore his ACL with someone rather than giving up, so I feel like it would end pretty badly,"" Ek explained.The Spotify co-founder also shared insights into Zuckerberg's evolution over their 16-year friendship, describing three distinct versions of the Facebook founder. From the unflattering portrayal in "" The Social Network "" to the fallout from the Cambridge Analytica scandal, Ek believes Zuckerberg has emerged as ""Mark 3.0"" - a leader who has recaptured his edge and learned to act responsibly with his enormous platform.The two maintain a relationship built on mutual respect, admiration, and a healthy dose of competitive spirit - just not on the sports field. Ek and Zuckerberg recently co-authored an open letter calling for consistent AI regulation in the EU, highlighting their shared concerns about the future of technology.","Spotify CEO Daniel Ek revealed that he refuses to play sports with his longtime friend, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg.
