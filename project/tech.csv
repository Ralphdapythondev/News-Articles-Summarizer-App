National security concerns behind the 'ban'

Key points of the

TikTok lawsuit

:

TikTok and its parent company China's ByteDance are fighting back against a recent US law that could force them to sell the popular video app or shut it down entirely. They filed a lawsuit in a federal court, claiming the law violates the US Constitution, specifically protections for free speech under the First Amendment. The law, signed by President Biden in April, gives ByteDance until January 2025 to sell TikTok or face a ban.In 2020 too, citing a threat to national security , then US President Donald Trump 's Commerce Department had sought to prevent the app from being downloaded in app stores and attempted to outlaw transactions between Americans and TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance.However, the attempt failed in US court.The lawsuit argues that the law is unnecessary and based on speculation. They deny any possibility of sharing user data with the Chinese government and accuse US lawmakers of being paranoid.The lawsuit highlights the impact on millions of Americans who use the platform. They argue that a forced sale or shutdown would silence these users and harm their ability to express themselves.The US government, however, is concerned about potential national security risks associated with Chinese ownership. They worry that user data could be accessed by the Chinese government.Long Standing tension between US and ChinaThis lawsuit is just the latest chapter in a years-long battle between the US and China over technology and internet control. Both countries have taken actions to restrict access to each other's platforms, citing national security concerns. In April, Apple was forced to remove WhatsApp and Threads from its China App Store due to Chinese security concerns.* 170 million Americans use TikTok. The company argues a ban would silence these users.* Divesting TikTok is impossible. They claim China wouldn't allow them to sell the key technology behind the app.* TikTok has a proposed security agreement with the US government. This agreement includes a ""shut-down option"" if TikTok violates its terms.* The lawsuit questions the urgency of the ban. They point out that the Biden administration continues to use TikTok, suggesting it may not be a true security threat.","TikTok and its parent company China's ByteDance are fighting back against a recent US law that could force them to sell the popular video app or shut it down entirely.

Microsoft launches AI chatbot for CIA and FBI: Here's what makes the Big difference is,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-launches-ai-chatbot-for-cia-and-fbi-heres-what-makes-the-big-difference-is/articleshow/109927740.cms,"Microsoft's solution breaks away from internet

Need for a foolproof solution

In a major development, Microsoft has delivered a powerful generative AI model specifically designed for US intelligence agencies , according to Bloomberg. This marks a significant breakthrough as it's the first time such a large language model operates entirely disconnected from the internet. Most AI models including OpenAI ’s ChatGPT rely on cloud services to learn and infer patterns from data, but Microsoft wanted to deliver a truly secure system to the US intelligence community.Intelligence agencies worldwide are eager to leverage generative AI for analysing classified data. However, security concerns regarding potential data leaks or hacking have limited their adoption.Microsoft addressed this challenge by creating a unique system. They adapted the GPT-4 model and supporting elements to run on a completely isolated cloud environment, with an ""air gap"" separating it from the internet. This isolation ensures the system's security and prevents classified information from being compromised.Intelligence officials recognize the potential of generative AI to revolutionise intelligence gathering. Last year, the CIA launched a similar, but unclassified, ChatGPT-based service. However, the demand for handling highly sensitive data necessitated a more secure solution.William Chappell, Microsoft's chief technology officer for strategic missions and technology, spearheaded this project. He described it as a challenging endeavour, requiring a complete overhaul of an existing AI supercomputer in Iowa. The team, initially unsure of the approach in 2022, persevered and successfully delivered the isolated system. “This is the first time we’ve ever had an isolated version – when isolated means it’s not connected to the internet – and it’s on a special network that’s only accessible by the US government,” Chappell told Bloomberg News ahead of an official announcement.The deployed GPT-4 model can access and analyse files, but it's intentionally static. This means it cannot learn from the data it processes or from the internet. This design choice prevents sensitive information from being inadvertently incorporated into the platform.The service, operational since last Thursday, awaits testing and accreditation by US intelligence agencies. While roughly 10,000 authorised personnel will have access, the system's isolation ensures classified data remains secure.",Microsoft has delivered a powerful generative AI model specifically designed for US intelligence agencies.

Apple just wrapped up its first event of the year, Let Loose . Even though it was relatively short, at 38 minutes, Apple announced a bunch of new things, including a couple of new iPads and a next-gen chip. Here’s all that Apple announced at today’s event.The new iPad Pro models come with vibrant OLED screens, a powerful M4 chip , and a sleek design. The Pro model comes in 11-inch and 13-inch sizes, with the larger model being slightly bigger than before.Under the hood, the iPad Pro models feature Apple's latest M4 chip, built on second-generation 3nm technology. The new models also come with an increased base storage of 256GB and support for the new Apple Pencil Pro and Magic Keyboard. However, these upgrades come at a premium, with the 11-inch model starting at Rs 99,900 and the 13-inch model starting at Rs 1,29,900, making them the most expensive iPads to date.iPad Air, which was earlier only available in 11-inch, now also comes in a more significant 13-inch screen option, and both of them have a Liquid Retina XDR. Powered by the M2 chip, the Air has also received an entry storage bump, now having at least 256GB. The camera on the front is being moved to the longer side, so that one can use it horizontally. There’s still no FaceID, though. The colours have also been refreshed, adding new blue, purple, and gold shades.

“Microsoft has not only taken advantage of the dominant position in the markets of Operating Systems (Windows) and traditional productivity software (Microsoft Office, Windows Server, SQL Server) to force the use of its

Azure

cloud, but they have also imposed artificial barriers that limit the ability of startups to compete fairly and competitively. These practices include barriers to data portability or contractual conditions that restrict competition in software licenses, preventing the free choice of providers of these services, reducing the capacity for choice and flexibility that startups need to be able to be resilient, innovate and grow.”

“We believe that all companies should be able to compete in an environment of equality so as not to be left behind either as customers or as companies providing this technology.”

Previous complaints about Microsoft’s cloud practices



Microsoft is facing a new complaint from a startup group in Spain regarding its cloud practices. The startup group submitted its complaint against the tech giant to the country’s antitrust regulator. Earlier, another trade group made a similar complaint against the company to the EU. This is the latest grievance concerning Microsoft’s rapidly expanding cloud computing services.The Spanish Startup Association , which brought about the complaint, represents more than 700 startups in the country.The organisation cited several allegedly anti-competitive measures practised by Microsoft in recent years.The complaint document (seen by the news agency Reuters) alleges:The association asked the Spanish competition watchdog to launch an investigation against Microsoft’s cloud practices and to take urgent measures to ensure a competitive market.In a statement to Reuters, the Spanish Startup Association’s president, Carlos Mateo said:In November 2023, Cloud Infrastructure Services Providers in Europe (CISPE) complained to EU antitrust regulators about Microsoft's new contract terms that were imposed in October of the same year. The group whose members include e-commerce major and Microsoft’s cloud computing rival Amazon also highlighted other alleged malpractices. CISPE said that these practices were harming the European cloud computing ecosystem.As part of its investigation, the European Commission asked other cloud rivals about Microsoft's request for customer data. Apart from the EU’s competition watchdog, the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is also probing the cloud sector.Microsoft ranks second in the cloud computing sector, behind market leader Amazon. However, the company is expected to close the gap rapidly as multiple generative AI-based features powered by OpenAI's technology are attracting more business users.",The Spanish Startup Association represents more than 700 startups in the country.

The company is expected to announce two new iPad Pro modes – 12.9-inch and 11-inch and is set to bring several small and big changes to Apple’s most premium iPads.First and foremost, Apple iPad Pro models are expected to come with OLED displays for the first time ditching the mini-LED in the 12.9 model and LCD panel in the 11-inch. With the OLED panels, the iPad display quality is set to go up in terms of contrast, colour production, colour accuracy, black levels and more and this will come in handy for people who use it for creating illustrations, art, editing photos and videos, etc.Apart from this, both the models are set to go slimmer by almost 20% compared to the outgoing models. Also, the iPads are expected to be about 15% smaller overall.New iPad Pro models are also expected to be powered by Apple’s new M4 chip . And, if this happens, these iPads will become the first models to debut with Apple’s latest silicon.Another major change that we may get to see is in terms of front-facing camera placement. Reports suggest that Apple will place the front-facing camera in landscape mode this time around.Apple is expected to introduce a bigger iPad Air featuring a 12.9-inch display, similar to the iPad Pro model. This will be accompanied by the existing one – the 11-inch model – as well. With today’s launch, iPad Air buyers will have two options to choose from.As per some reports, the 12.9-inch iPad Air will feature the same mini-LED panel as the outgoing iPad Pro 12.9-inch. While some reports also suggest that Apple could use the LCD display with it.In terms of performance, the iPad Air is expected to be powered by an M2 chip which should bring a notable speed upgrade. Also, some new colour options are also set to make the cut.Magic Keyboard has been long due for an upgrade and this year, it is finally happening. Now, the outgoing model isn't bad, it balances out functionality and forms pretty well. However, the upcoming model is set to bring some design changes like an aluminium base and a bigger trackpad.Also, rumours suggest that the upcoming Magic Keyboard will be exclusive to the iPad Pro models.New Apple Pencil pr Pencils are coming. Tim Cook has already dropped the hit via its official X handle. It is expected that Apple will launch Apple Pencil 3 at the event. The headline feature is expected to be magnetically swappable tips. This means users can easily switch between different tips for different needs.A Pro monkier Pencil is also expected. However, not much is known about it.One feature, however, Apple is expected to include is Find My integration and a squeeze gesture.",iPads will take centre stage at the Let loose event.

A captivating romance can uplift anyone's spirits, and anime has a unique ability to vividly portray these narratives. Over the years, Japanese animation has delivered numerous romantic tales, ranging from light-hearted comedies to deeply emotional dramas.For romance enthusiasts, going through so many anime options can be overwhelming. However, there are several exceptional romance anime series that truly shine above the rest.Here is a curated list of top romance anime series , compiled by Game Rant, along with their respective rankings.Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie stirred mixed reactions upon its debut in Spring 2022, often compared to ""My Dress-Up Darling"" but standing out as a unique slice-of-life anime centred around a charming couple, Shikimori and Yuu Izumi.One distinctive aspect of the series is its portrayal of the main couple already in a relationship, a rarity in anime. While the episodes focus on everyday moments, they paint a wholesome picture of young love with two endearing characters navigating the nuances of romance.Describing Bakemonogatari as a straightforward romance might be a stretch, but this instalment of Monogatari indeed focuses on and highlights the relationship between Koyomi Araragi and Hitagi Senjougahara. Their initial interactions are unconventional, involving a stapler to the face, but Araragi's determination to assist Senjougahara with her curse ultimately brings them closer.Despite the surreal and eccentric nature of Monogatari, the romance between Araragi and Senjougahara is remarkably grounded and healthy. While the series introduces other potential romantic interests, their relationship remains steadfast and central to the narrative.""Sing 'Yesterday' for Me"" presents romance in a refreshingly realistic manner compared to many other anime. The series takes a classic love triangle and steers it in an unexpected direction by the end, resulting in a highly satisfying conclusion that portrays how failed romances can evolve into strong friendships.Directed by Yoshiyuki Fujiwara, known for his work on popular anime like ""Attack on Titan"" and ""Sword Art Online,"" the shift to a show with such a different tone demonstrates his versatility and mastery in storytelling across diverse genres.""My Happy Marriage"" emerged as one of the standout romance anime of Summer 2023, adapted from Akumi Agitogi's novel series. Set in an alternate Meiji Restoration era with supernatural elements, the story follows Miyo, who endures mistreatment from her stepfamily despite her privileged background. Her family arranges her marriage to a notorious military figure known for rejecting wives quickly, with rejection spelling disaster for Miyo. However, Kiyoka surprises everyone by taking an interest in Miyo and becoming incensed by her family's cruelty.The anime delves into the lasting impact of Miyo's abuse, highlighting her struggle to regain self-worth, even with Kiyoka's support. Kiyoka himself is a complex character with hidden motives behind his initial attraction to Miyo, although his feelings for her are genuine.While the romance between Miyo and Kiyoka is heartwarming, ""My Happy Marriage"" falls short in other areas. The supernatural elements can seem disjointed, and the villains are one-dimensional despite being detestable.Based on Fumita Yanagida's popular and finished manga, ""Tomo-chan Is a Girl!"" stood out as one of Winter 2023's most amusing romantic comedies. Tomo and Jun share a close friendship, but Jun sees Tomo strictly as a friend, unaware of her romantic feelings.While romance is central to its characters, ""Tomo-chan Is a Girl!"" leans heavily into comedy. Tomo and Jun's dynamic is charming, and they're supported by entertaining characters like Misuzu and Carol. Despite its comedic tone, the chemistry between Tomo and Jun develops convincingly over the season. Unlike some romance anime, Tomo-chan excels in portraying why its leads are compatible without difficulty.Teen romance anime often dominate the genre, but there are exceptions worth noting. ""Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku"" is primarily a workplace comedy that revolves around two couples: the newly formed pair of Hirotaka Nifuji and Narumi Momose, and the more established couple, Tarou Kabakura and Hanako Koyanagi. The focus remains on Hirotaka and Narumi, with the series emphasising humour over romance, but Tarou and Hanako's relationship is depicted realistically.Despite being childhood friends, Narumi struggles to see Hirotaka as a potential romantic interest, a dynamic that persists throughout the series. The anime's brevity limits the depth of these relationships, but ""Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku"" provides an entertaining journey within its runtime.""Romantic Killer"" cleverly parodies romance and harem anime while paying homage to their core strengths. Anzu, a girl with no interest in boys, is suddenly thrust into a reverse harem scenario by a magical being, disrupting her life of gaming and chocolate consumption. Unamused by her newfound romantic entanglements with unfamiliar guys, Anzu navigates this unconventional situation with scepticism.Primarily a comedy, ""Romantic Killer"" aims to elicit laughter from its audience, often succeeding with its humour rooted in its origins as a shonen manga, characterised by exaggerated facial expressions.Though not always aiming for emotional depth, the anime treats its characters and their relationships seriously. Anzu shines as a compelling lead, and the male characters introduced as potential partners are well-developed. ""Romantic Killer"" offers a delightful blend of humour and romance for those seeking an entertaining and unconventional love story.""The Angel Next Door Spoils Me Rotten"" captivates viewers from the start for several reasons. Firstly, Project No.9's animation is impressive, featuring clean and detailed character designs. Secondly, and most importantly, the main characters exhibit instant chemistry, evident when Amane offers his umbrella to a soaked Mahiru, sparking a connection.Throughout the series, despite the frequent presence of both leads on screen, ""The Angel Next Door Spoils Me Rotten"" effectively delves into their individual personalities while also developing their friendship.Rumiko Takahashi is celebrated as a legendary mangaka, known for classics like Inuyasha, Ranma 1/2, and Urusei Yatsura. While most of her renowned works fall within the shonen genre, Takahashi has also ventured into seinen storytelling. Maison Ikkoku stands out as one of her most mature works, emphasising romance as its primary theme.Unlike Takahashi's prominent shonen series that explore various genres such as comedy and action alongside romance, Maison Ikkoku focuses squarely on romantic elements, enriched with drama, character development, and humour.The central relationship features Kyouko and Yuusaku, both drawn to each other but hindered by their circumstances. Kyouko, grieving the recent loss of her husband, is hesitant to move forward. Meanwhile, Yuusaku, deeply in love with Kyouko, doubts his worthiness as a student. The anime chronicles their journeys of growth, healing, and mutual misunderstanding, complemented by well-developed secondary characters.Insomniacs After School emerged as the standout romance of Spring 2023, adapted from Makoto Ojiro's esteemed seinen manga. The story revolves around two students plagued by insomnia, a burden they carried alone until they met at their school's observatory. Isaki and Ganta form an immediate bond, which deepens as they work together to revive the Astronomy Club, driven by their shared need to preserve their newfound sanctuary.The anime boasts impeccable pacing, skillfully depicting the protagonists' isolation due to insomnia and the subtle solace they find in each other. While romance is a central theme, the series prioritises developing Ganta and Isaki's friendship before advancing their relationship, emphasising the depth of their connection beyond shared circumstances.Kokoro Connect injects a supernatural twist into a classic love triangle scenario. The story centers around Taichi, Iori, Yui, Yoshifumi, and Himeko, students of the Student Cultural Research Club, whose lives take a turn when they receive supernatural abilities from a mysterious being named Heartseed.As they grapple with these newfound powers, the group experiences sensory phenomena that challenge their relationships and reveal hidden aspects of their personalities. The anime is rich in character development, providing an engaging and thought-provoking experience.Maid Sama! carries many tropes that might derail other romance anime: an overly perfect male lead, a strong female protagonist reduced to a damsel, and an unnecessary love triangle. Despite these shortcomings, Maid Sama! shines through its strong personality.The heart of Maid Sama! lies in the relationship between Takumi Usui, a charming heartthrob, and Misaki Ayuzawa, a strict student council president with a busy schedule balancing school, home, and work. When Takumi discovers Misaki's secret job at a maid cafe, it opens a new perspective on the usually composed president.In ""Rascal Does Not Dream Of Bunny Girl Senpai,"" romance plays a subtle yet compelling role that defines the series. The story centers on Sakuta Azusagawa, a high school student drawn to girls suffering from Adolescence Syndrome, a condition linked to their insecurities.While the anime unfolds through different arcs focusing on various girls, the standout is the initial saga featuring Mai Sakurajima, an actress who forms a close bond with Sakuta. Their dynamic crackles with romantic tension, warmth, and clever banter. Although not always in the foreground, their relationship develops steadily across subsequent arcs, leading to a satisfying sequel in the form of a feature film.Wakana Gojou and Marin Kitagawa inhabit completely contrasting worlds. Gojou, isolated and reserved, keeps himself apart from others due to his passion for hina dolls, fearing ridicule. In contrast, Kitagawa is popular, outgoing, and self-assured.Despite their differences, Kitagawa becomes intrigued by cosplay and sees Gojou as the ideal person to create outfits for her. ""My Dress-Up Darling"" is a charming, humorous, and beautifully animated romance anime that excels in executing classic genre tropes with finesse.""Toradora!"" is a beloved slice-of-life romantic comedy that offers a wonderful entry point into the genre. The story revolves around Ryuji Yusaku and Taiga Aisaka, two students who have crushes on each other's best friends.Both Ryuji and Taiga are viewed as outcasts—Ryuji due to his intimidating appearance and Taiga because of her fiery temper. They team up to assist each other in their romantic pursuits. The series delves into their evolving dynamic and the humorous mishaps that ensue as they navigate their intertwined love lives.""The Pet Girl of Sakurasou"" depicts the journey of an eccentric group of characters as they navigate growth and self-discovery. Sorata Kanda is forced to move into the unconventional Sakura House after being kicked out of his school's main dorms.In Sakura House, Sorata encounters talented yet troubled students. When a peculiar young artist joins the dorm, Sorata takes on the responsibility of helping her adjust to her new life. The series delves into the interactions among the dorm mates, their personal aspirations, and the interconnected nature of their relationships.""Ouran High School Host Club"" is a delightful reverse harem anime filled with lighthearted and meaningful moments. Haruhi Fujioka accidentally breaks an antique vase belonging to her school's Host Club and must repay her debt by disguising herself as a boy and working as a host.The series excels in developing Haruhi's character along with her fellow hosts, providing insight into their motivations and personalities. It's a must-watch for shojo fans, featuring a memorable cast of characters that carries the show through its run.Kyoto Animation has produced many beloved anime, and ""Love, Chunibyo & Other Delusions!"" is among them. The series centers around a phenomenon known as Chunibyo, where adolescents have grandiose and unrealistic delusions.Yuta Togashi, who has outgrown his delusional phase, aims for a normal high school life. However, things take a turn when his classmate, Rikka Takanashi, reminds him of his past and tries to pull him back into the world of Chunibyo with her own delusions. The series delves into their relationship as Yuta unravels the triggers behind Rikka's delusions.The trope of opposites attracting may be overused, but when done well, it can lead to a captivating romantic comedy. ""Kimi ni Todoke"" explores the endearing friendship between the shy Sawako Kuronuma and the popular Shouta Kazehaya. Sawako, often mistaken for Sadako from ""The Ring,"" is isolated at school due to her appearance, making it challenging for her to break out of her shell. Fortunately, Kazehaya is just the right person to help her.""Kimi ni Todoke"" is a delightful and heartwarming anime with well-developed characters who evolve as the story unfolds. While it adheres to typical romance anime pacing, the journey remains engaging and enjoyable.Unlike most romance stories that focus on the process of falling in love, ""Tonikawa: Over The Moon For You"" follows a married couple who have already reached that point. As a result, the anime adopts a slice-of-life approach, showcasing Nasa and Tsukasa's daily life and antics rather than a typical romantic journey. ""Tonikawa"" doesn't rely on dramatic highs but instead offers a pleasant and light-hearted experience.While this anime may not appeal to everyone, it serves as a refreshing departure from more melodramatic romance shows. Despite their tendency to blush at the slightest physical contact, Nasa and Tsukasa are refreshingly direct in expressing their feelings, making them both witty and likeable characters.This romantic anime shines because of its main character, Takeo Gouda. His towering, imposing presence contrasts beautifully with his heartfelt affection for the delicate Rinko, which is truly heartwarming. Takeo's efforts to play matchmaker for Rinko with his best friend, despite his own feelings, demonstrate his genuine kindness.Viewers will undoubtedly root for Takeo and Rinko's endearing relationship. ""My Love Story!!"" delivers the goods without delay, as the main characters are dating for most of the episodes, bypassing the typical slow build-up to a confession.""A Sign of Affection"" is a heartwarming romantic comedy centred on college-age love and the challenges of communication. While not the sole focus of the story, Yuki and Itsuomi stand out as the main couple, instantly captivating viewers. Yuki, who is hearing-impaired, communicates using sign language, text, and by reading lips, while Itsuomi is a world traveller passionate about learning languages. Their connection begins on a train and grows stronger with each subsequent encounter.The anime beautifully captures the intense emotions of falling in love, highlighted by a poignant moment in the opening episode. With an older cast, ""A Sign of Affection"" takes on a more mature tone compared to typical romance anime. Throughout the season, Yuki and Itsuomi become increasingly comfortable around each other, resulting in consistently endearing interactions.This romantic anime is ideal for LGBTQ+ viewers seeking representation on screen, but its well-crafted storytelling makes it enjoyable for all audiences. The heartwarming romance blossoms between Mafuyu and Ritsuka as Mafuyu learns to play guitar and sing in Ritsuka's band.Watching Mafuyu's growing confidence alongside the romantic tension creates a compelling series that's hard to resist. The accompanying movie is also outstanding and a must-watch continuation of the series.Nana is one of the most renowned and beloved shoujo anime of all time, a must-watch for fans of romance and beyond. The series follows two women named Nana, seemingly different but navigating curiously similar life situations that lead to separate outcomes.Without giving away how their stories intertwine, Nana's 47 episodes delve into the protagonists' perspectives on love through various relationships. Grounded in reality, the anime explores complex characters who, despite occasional extremes, face accountability for their actions.Your Lie in April, one of the most famous romance anime, revolves around two music prodigies: Kousei Arima and Kaori Miyazono. Kousei, grappling with depression after his mother's death, loses his passion for the piano and withdraws from the performance arts. One day, he hears Kaori playing her violin with such freedom that it reignites his love for music and sparks his admiration for her.The anime delves into themes of grief, life, love, and music. Kousei's journey toward self-healing is profound, marked by heartbreak, but also punctuated by moments of beauty, tenderness, and joy.In this anime, Miyuki and Kaguya engage in a battle of wits to avoid confessing their love first, using their intellect and skills to outmaneuver each other. Both are determined not to be seen as the one who gives in.Their antics running the student council at an elite school with their friends are uproariously funny yet also contain heartwarming moments that will make viewers cheer. Season 3 of Kaguya-sama: Love is War, which aired in Spring 2022, leaned heavily into comedy but also devoted more time to developing Miyuki and Kaguya's relationship and touching on other romances.If the anime follows the manga, the next season of Love is War promises to be predominantly romantic. If successful, this upcoming release could elevate Kaguya-sama to the pinnacle of romance anime.This anime consists of two parts: Clannad and After Story. The latter surpasses the former by a wide margin, but watching Clannad is essential to fully appreciate the impact of After Story. While it features a diverse cast of supporting characters, the heart of the show revolves around Tomoya Okazaki and Nagisa Furukawa, delivering a profound narrative.Unlike typical romance series, Clannad After Story unfolds beyond high school, depicting the growth of Tomoya and Nagisa as individuals and as a couple. The anime tackles real-life challenges without glossing over them, offering a genuine exploration of common struggles.The Dangers in My Heart is truly brilliant. At first glance, it may seem like another typical shounen romance where a popular girl falls for an ordinary loner guy. These stories often offer little beyond wish fulfilment, and The Dangers in My Heart initially appears to fit that mould. Yet, the anime stands out.Ichikawa is an average guy with few friends who daydreams about unusual things. While the anime doesn't delve deeply into these thoughts, it doesn't ignore them either, leaving Ichikawa with a poor first impression. On the other hand, Anna is a cheerful but shy girl who loves food and works as a model. After a chance encounter at the school library, the two start spending time together, developing a friendship that hints at something deeper. Anna encourages Ichikawa to break out of his shell, leading to significant changes in him over the course of two seasons.Although slow-paced initially, The Dangers in My Heart evolves into something special by the end of season 1, maintaining its momentum in the subsequent cour and establishing itself as one of the best romance anime of all time. Anna and Ichikawa are both exceptional characters, but Anna's depth is what elevates the show. She's not just an idealised plot device; she's a fully realised character with insecurities, quirks, and vulnerabilities. Her interest in Ichikawa feels genuine, and vice versa. This is a rare quality in romance anime.Fruits Basket is the definitive romance anime, masterfully blending drama and comedy. Tooru Honda, a lovable protagonist, faces life's challenges until she moves in with the Souma family. The Soumas, particularly Yuki, are school idols hiding a shocking secret that alters perceptions.Love triangles often lack depth, favouring one partner over the other. Fruits Basket defies this norm with its compelling love triangle, where each character is fully developed. Across three seasons, Fruits Basket takes viewers on an unforgettable journey.Also read | 15 best anime series of all time; here's the list","Japanese animation has delivered numerous romantic tales, ranging from light- hearted comedies to deeply emotional dramas.

We don't want you to run govt if given bail due to polls: SC to CM Arvind Kejriwal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/we-dont-want-you-to-run-govt-if-given-bail-due-to-polls-sc-to-cm-arvind-kejriwal/articleshow/109932335.cms,"Court shouldn’t treat politicians as separate class for interim relief: SG

NEW DELHI: Amid opposition from ED, which said granting interim bail to Arvind Kejriwal would send the wrong message that some accused were more equal before the law, Supreme Court on Tuesday reserved its order and observed the PMLA case linked to the alleged excise policy scam concerned ""extraordinary situations"" where the accused was an elected CM and not a ""habitual offender or somebody involved in many other cases"".However, the court told the CM, ""Suppose we grant interim bail on account of elections. Then if you say you will attend office, it may have a cascading effect. We don't want you performing official duties as... it will lead to conflict (of interest). It's not a matter of legality but of propriety.""Meanwhile, a Delhi court extended Kejriwal's judicial custody till May 20.SC said it has to consider interim relief, if at all, as it was not possible to conclude hearing and deliver judgment on Kejriwal’s plea challenging his arrest before May 17 when the court goes into summer recess and Delhi votes on May 25.Taking cue from the observation of the SC bench of Justices Sanjiv Khanna and Dipankar Datta, senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, appearing for Kejriwal, instantly assured the court that he would not sign any document after coming out of jail but the Delhi lieutenant governor should also not return files for lack of his signature.Opposing the proposal for interim relief, solicitor general Tushar Mehta said the court should not treat politicians as a separate class for interim relief as it would demoralise common people like workers, farmers and labourers who would think the law is favourable to those who hold high posts.""All are equal before law and the message should not go that some are more equal. Do not earmark politicians as a separate class,"" Mehta said. He added that a wrong perception was being created that Kejriwal was arrested just before the election but the fact was that he had defied nine summons issued by ED and derailed the probe for six months. Mehta said a farmer could ask for interim relief for harvesting.""Look, there are 2-3 issues...one is, he is an elected chief minister. The elections are round the corner. These are extraordinary situations. He is not otherwise a habitual offender, or somebody who has been involved in many other cases... and elections are held once in five years. It's not like harvesting after every six months,"" the bench said.Mehta said hundreds of politicians were in jail but no politician had so far been released on bail for election campaigning. ""Arvind Kejriwal was not picked up suddenly because of elections. He was summoned by ED since last six months. Kejriwal was not appearing before ED under pretexts like going for meditation etc. Still, ED did not directly pick him up and approached the court. Six months were wasted by Kejriwal and, therefore, he was arrested belatedly,"" he added.The court clarified that it had been granting interim relief in many cases, even in those involving heinous offences and it was considering Kejriwal's plea not because he was a politician. It referred to SC's verdict granting relief to journalist Arnab Goswami.""Let it be very clear that we are not going by whether he is a politician or not. We are only considering whether the person falls under special circumstances in view of the election,"" the bench said. It added that the CM was entitled to say that he was arrested just before the election as his name first cropped up in the case in Feb 2023.",Supreme Court reserved its order and observed the PMLA case linked to the alleged excise policy scam.

I stand by my word that Rythu Bandhu implementation will be completed before May 9.I am repeating my challenge to BRS president K Chandrasekhar Rao to come to Telangana Martyrs' memorial on May 9. If Rythu Bandhu scheme is not implemented totally by then, he should rub his nose to the ground, if it is incomplete then I will rub my nose,"" he said at a street corner meeting while campaigning in Warangal (SC) LS constituency on Tuesday.The Congress govt had made all preparations to deposit Rythu Bandhu amounts into bank accounts of four lakh farmers as it has already been disbursed to 65 lakh farmers.But the BRS and BJP, as part of their secret deal to defeat the Congress, went to ECI and got the disbursal stopped, he said.""At 4 pm today, I received notices from ECI not to disburse the Rythu Bandhu amount. But farmers are watching everything and will teach BRS and BJP a lesson in the Lok Sabha polls. Farmers know that in 2018 assembly election while people were going into polling booths to cast their vote, Rythu Bandhu amount was being deposited into bank accounts. Farmers received SMSs about it on their mobiles even on polling day. Then the BJP felt happy and did not go to ECI and did not stop disbursal. BRS and BJP have entered into a secret deal and are working together,"" the CM said.He slammed KCR for mortgaging and surrendering Warangal LS seat to the BJP to ensure that his daughter and party MLC K Kavitha gets bail in Delhi liquor case.""Aroori Ramesh, a land grabber, was sent by the BRS into BJP which gave him the Warangal ticket. Then KCR fielded a dummy candidate from Warangal to boost the electoral prospects of the BJP candidate,"" he alleged.Why should people of Warangal constituency vote for the BJP? Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led BJP govt at the Centre, during last 10 years, did not give us a steel plant, took proposed Kazipet rail coach factory to Maharashtra, cancelled ITIR project, did not give national status to PRLIS, did not give us IIM, IIT, all promised in the State Reorganisation Act.Modi govt did not give funds for Ramappa Temple, which got UNESCO recognition, or for Thousand Pillar Temple, Warangal ORR, airport, underground drainage system, Warangal smart city project, leather and textile parks, Revanth said and added that instead Modi took all important projects to his home state Gujarat.",A Revanth Reddy accused BRS and BJP of jointly conspiring to complain to the Election Commission of India to stop disbursal of Rythu Bandhu money.

BENGALURU: Braving the scorching summer sun and heatwave, voters of north and central Karnataka turned out in their numbers to vote in the second phase of Lok Sabha elections helping the state register a 70.4% turnout in 14 seats on Tuesday that catapulted the cumulative figures for the two phases of polling to 69.9% - the best ever for the state since electioneering began in 1951.Of the 14 seats that went to the polls in the 2nd phase, Chikkodi, with 76.9% polling had the best figures. This seat had also recorded the highest voter turnout of 75.5% in 2019.Gulbarga, which recorded a maximum temperature of around 43°C on Tuesday, saw the lowest turnout among the 14 parliamentary seats, with only 61.7% voters exercising their franchise.The final figures for the 14 segments in north Karnataka defied all expectations and proved many a pundit wrong as there were concerns that the turnout may be lower compared to 2019, primarily in view of the heatwave sweeping across the state.The turnout not only surpassed the stats for the last three Lok Sabha elections, but was also close to the significant 70% turnout milestone.The state has a total of 28 Lok Sabha constituencies. The first phase of polling for 14 seats in the southern and coastal districts on April 26 had recorded a 69.5% turnout. In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the state's 28 seats had recorded a 68.8% voter turnout. Overall, polling remained peaceful in the second phase, with only minor incidents of violence reported, including stone-pelting in Shorapur (Surapur) that left one person injured.No major violence was reported in the second phase of polls in the state, Manoj Kumar Meena, the Chief Electoral Officer of Karnataka, said.While voter turnout in north Karnataka outshone that of the southern and coastal constituencies, Mandya, which went to polls in the first phase, retained its lead in terms of voter participation with a 81.1% turnout.In 2019, Raichur had recorded the lowest polling with 58.3% voters turning out, but it came up with a marginally improved showing this time around with 61.8% voters turning out to vote.In comparison, Bangalore Central, the IT-BT capital of the country, recorded barely 54% turnout and was the lowest among all the 28 seats in the state this time.Meanwhile, Shorapur (Surapur), the sole assembly seat that had bypolls due to the death of sitting Congress MLA Raja Venkatappa Naik, registered 66.7% polling.","Voters of north and central Karnataka turned out in their numbers to vote in the second phase of Lok Sabha elections.

NEW DELHI: After Delhi Capitals (DC) defeated Rajasthan Royals (RR) by 20 runs, captain Rishabh Pant praised his bowlers, especially Kuldeep Yadav , for their outstanding performance in the last overs.A masterclass from Sanju Samson nearly sealed the deal for RR, but the DC bowlers persevered to secure their sixth home victory of the year and maintain their hopes of making the playoffs.After the game Pant said, ""The way our bowlers executed at the back end was the main positive and it was really good to see. We will try to learn from every game. Even when we lose or win, we will keep our head down and keep moving forward. As always Kuldeep delivered which was great to see. It was close to par and at the same time we were thinking that if we can restrict them to 200 that would be fair and that was the thought process.""In the final three overs, DC scored 53 runs while RR only scored 20. The Royals have not pursued a target for the second consecutive game. Even though the Royals lost both of their openers during the powerplay, they were still able to stay within striking distance and looked like strong favorites to complete the chase.However, the game was flipped on its head when Sanju Samson and Shubham Dubey were removed from the game quickly, as the remaining batters were unable to keep up with the requisite rate pressure.Credit goes to Kuldeep for bowling a game-changing 18th over in which he picked up two wickets for just four runs. Overall, it was a much-needed victory for DC to improve their campaign, and aside from their problems with their plodding over-overs bowling, the Royals will be concerned about their second consecutive defeat.DC climbed to the fifth spot with six wins, six losses and 12 points. RR stayed second with eight wins, three losses and 16 points.","Delhi Capitals (DC) defeated Rajasthan Royals (RR) by 20 runs.

""Even if one listed beneficiary is left out of the scheme on May 9, I will rub my nose on the ground at the Martyrs' Memorial. If it's done, BRS president K Chandrasekhar Rao should do the same and tender an apology to farmers,"" he said at the meeting.It may be recalled the EC had also stopped disbursal of Rythu Bandhu money, two days before Nov 30, 2023 assembly polls when then minister T Harish Rao made an announcement on Nov 28 about distributing the amount to farmers, citing MCC violation . The BRS govt was asked to comply with the EC’s directive and ensure that the Rythu Bandhu payments were processed only after the conclusion of assembly elections The EC had given a ‘no objection’ certificate for the disbursement of money on Nov 24, 2023, only if the state govt adhered to its 2018 instructions. During the Dec 2018 assembly elections, the EC had set conditions for the disbursal of Rythu Bandhu funds like no addition of new beneficiaries, no publicity and no involvement of political functionaries in the disbursement process. Any violation of these guidelines would amount to breach of MCC, it said then.The Congress govt issued a GO on May 4 releasing ₹15 crore to farmers affected by heavy rains in 10 districts after EC’s permission.","The EC's decision came in the backdrop of Revanth's violation of the model code of conduct (MCC) The EC had also stopped disbursal of Rythu Bandhu money, two days before Nov 30, 2023 assembly polls when then minister T Harish Rao made an announcement.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109932087,imgsize-1018030,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/109932087.jpg"
