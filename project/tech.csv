"Apple CEO Tim Cook on calling its AI system, Apple Intelligence: It was sort of calling it what ….",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-ceo-tim-cook-on-calling-its-ai-system-apple-intelligence-it-was-sort-of-calling-it-what-/articleshow/110919792.cms,"Tim Cook on ‘hallucinations’ in AI systems

Apple unveiled its new artificial intelligence (AI) system, but with a twist. Instead of the industry-standard term, Apple has opted to call it “Apple Intelligence.” Company CEO Tim Cook has downplayed any hidden meaning behind the name choice, saying that the company is calling it what it is.“It seemed sort of a logical conclusion after looking at so many names. At least for me, I can tell you it wasn’t a riff off of artificial intelligence. It was sort of calling it what it is. I’m sure a lot will be said about it, but it’s probably not as it appears,” Cook said in an interview with The Washington Post, when asked why the company chose Apple Intelligence over the conventional term.Apple unveiled its AI system, Apple Intelligence, integrating machine learning models designed for everyday tasks across iPhones, iPads and Macs. The AI system leverages Apple silicon for functions like understanding and generating language, taking action across apps and personalising user experiences – all with keeping privacy as a core focus.For this, Apple collaborated with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI and also announced that it will bring the free version of the app as opt-in. Apple senior vice president of Software Engineering, Craig Federighi , also said that the company may work with more models, like Google Gemini , in the future.When asked whether Apple can stop AI hallucinations – a term used for responses generated by AI chatbots that are incorrect or misleading but presented in a very confident manner – Cook said that Apple Intelligence may produce false information.“It’s not 100 percent. But I think we have done everything that we know to do, including thinking very deeply about the readiness of the technology in the areas that we’re using it in. So I am confident it will be very high quality. But I’d say in all honesty that’s short of 100 percent. I would never claim that it’s 100 percent,” Cook said.On the most immediate Ai benefits for Apple customers, Cook said that “they’re going to save time and that “things are going to become more efficient [for them].”","Apple unveiled its new artificial intelligence (AI) system, but with a twist.

Spotify may get more expensive later this year for this ‘good’ reason: Here's how much extra you have to pay,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/spotify-may-get-more-expensive-later-this-year-for-this-good-reason-heres-how-much-extra-you-have-to-pay/articleshow/110919798.cms,"What it means for Spotify subscribers

What Spotify has to say

Spotify has been working on a new tier of subscription plan that will offer high-fidelity (HiFi) audio to users for years now. Initially announced to launch in 2021, the pricey tier never arrived but rumours around it occasionally popped up online. According to a latest report, the Swedish company may finally launch the HiFi audio tier later this year.Citing a person familiar with the plan, Bloomberg reported that Spotify will introduce a new expensive plan – purportedly called “Supremium” – later this year as an add-on for existing users.“Users will be charged at least $5 more per month for access to better audio and new tools for creating playlists and managing their song libraries,” the report said, citing the source.Since the “Supremium” tier is said to be positioned as an add-on for existing customers, their subscription price will remain the same. However, customers who choose to upgrade will have to shell out an additional $5. This means that the subscribers of Spotify Premium plan – which is going to be $11.99 from next month – will cost $16.99.The report said that this add-on subscription will “generate additional sales for the company and its business partners.”“The new tier’s pricing will vary depending on each user’s base plan but will average out to about a 40% markup,” the Bloomberg report cited the person as saying.Spotify's premium subscribers rose by 14% to 239 million in the first quarter ended March 31 from a year earlier. It forecast monthly active users at 631 million for the second quarter.Spotify has neither confirmed nor denied the speculation about new features.“At Spotify, we are constantly exploring ideas to improve our product offering and offer value to users. But we don’t comment on speculation around possible new features and do not have anything new to share at this time,” Spotify spokesperson Grey Munford told The Verge.","Spotify has been working on a new tier of subscription plan that will offer high-fidelity (HiFi) audio to users for years now.

In a series of posts and replies on X, formerly Twitter, Musk lambasted Apple for partnering with OpenAI.Musk slammed the integration of ChatGPT in iPhones and other Apple devices, calling it ""unacceptable security violation"". Warning iPhone and other Apple device users, Musk said, “Apple has no clue what’s actually going on once they hand your data over to OpenAI.

""If Apple integrates OpenAI at the OS level, then Apple devices will be banned at my companies. That is an unacceptable security violation,"" wrote Musk. ""And visitors will have to check their Apple devices at the door, where they will be stored in a Faraday cage,"" Musk added in another post.Taking on the Apple-OpenAI collaboration, Musk, while responding to a follower on X, even went on to say that his own X phone is a possibility with Samsung as a potential partner which cannot be ruled out.Reacting to an X user who claimed that “X will partner with Samsung to manufacture an X phone” which will be optimised for the X app, offer an open-source operating system (OS) and a “direct connection to Starlink"", Musk said “it is not out of the question”.Worldwide Developers Conference or WWDC is Apple's annual developers event where the company announces the next-generation version of the software that powers iPhones, iPads, Apple Watch, Apple TV and Macs.

Jyotiraditya M Scindia assumed charge as the union communications minister Tuesday (June 11). Soon after taking charge as telecom minister , Scindia said that he has tremendous emotional ties with the Department of Telecom(DoT).“It is also a little bit like coming full circle for me. I worked as a junior minister in this department in 2007, 2008 and 2009. For me, this is also a department with which I have had tremendous emotional ties. It is my sincere effort to ensure that we live up to the expectations of the people of India under the leadership of the Prime Minister,” Scindia said while talking to the media.Scindia was the Minister of State for Communications in the UPA-I government from 2007-2009. He is said to have played a key role in driving the post office modernisation with the Project Arrow scheme.“Both the telecom division as well as the India Post division have a tremendous role to play on a global stage, as well as, on a local stage. Under the Prime Minister’s leadership, there has been a revolution in this department.

Intel is reportedly expecting good news in a battle against the antitrust watchdogs of the European Union (EU) as a telecom operator of the region recently got a legal victory in a similar case. According to a report by the news agency Reuters, Germany-based telco Deutsche Telekom won a legal fight agianst EU antitrust regulators that will force them to pay interest on the portion of a fine reimbursed after the company made an appeal.The report claims that the US-based chipmaker may also get a victory as the company has made a similar claim of 593 million euro ($638.3 million).In the recent years, several companies have sued competition enforcers in the EU for default interest on fines in antitrust cases that were waived off. The report notes that the region’s anti-trust watchdogs faces claims that totals to about 800 million euros and Intel is the highest profile case.In 2014, the European Commission imposed a 31 million euro fine on Deutsche Telekom for charging unfair wholesale prices in Slovakia. Later on, a lower tribunal court reduced the penalty to 19 million euros and ordered the Commission to pay some 1.8 million euros in interest.The EU competition enforcer repaid the difference to Deutsche Telekom, but didn’t pay the interest for the period between the payment and the reimbursement.Now, the Luxembourg-based Court of Justice of the European Union ( CJEU ) has supported the German telecoms operators appeal and has asked the regulators to pay the interest.Judges said: “The (European) Commission must pay interest on fines it has unduly imposed in competition matters and which it has provisionally collected. That interest is intended to compensate, at a standard rate, the undertaking concerned for the loss of enjoyment of the amount in question.”The CJEU also noted that the lower tribunal was right to hold that the applicable interest rate which the Commission is required to pay to Deutsche Telekom is the European Central Bank (ECB) refinancing rate has increased by 3.5 percentage points, the report adds.Intel has claimed 593 million euros in interest on a reimbursed fine of 1.06 billion euros from a case which was overturned by the EU regulators overturned in 2022.

How Apple is trying to regain its position in China



Apple has achieved a new milestone in iPhone sales. As per data from Stocklytics.com (seen by Patently Apple), the Cupertino-based tech giant has about to reach the $2 trillion mark in iPhone's lifetime sales. This achievement comes after a recent decline in market share due to competition from Chinese brands like Xiaomi and Huawei.Since its introduction in 2007, this has been Apple’s most successful product as the company keeps updating its smartphones with new models and features.As per Statista data, Apple grossed $78.7 billion from iPhone sales within five years after releasing the first mode. Two years later, in FY 2014, this figure jumped to $101.9 billion and continued rising.The tech giant experienced several challenging years, especially in 2019 and 2020 when consumers worldwide reduced their spending budgets amid the pandemic. The report alsoclaims that iPhone sales have doubled and hit record highs in 2022 and 2023.During those two years, Apple grossed over $405 billion from selling iPhones, the highest figures in its history. Despite the revenue figures dropping slightly in the second quarter of FY 2024, iPhone sales remain strong. Statistics show Apple grossed $115.6 billion from iPhone sales in H1 FY 2024, pushing its lifetime revenue to a whopping $1.95 trillion.In Q1 FY 2009, Apple’s iPhone sales also accounted for about a quarter of Apple’s total revenue. Since then, this figure has more than doubled and hit 50.64% in Q1 2024.China is one of the biggest iPhone markets for Apple. According to a report by Counterpoint, Apple’s iPhone sales declined by more than 19% as Huawei saw 70% year-on-year growth in its smartphone sales in the country.To increase iPhone sales in China, Apple reportedly launched an aggressive discounting campaign on its official Tmall website in China in May. With these discounts, the company aims to fight off growing competition from local brands like Huawei. The latest discounts were steeper than those offered earlier this year.","Apple grossed $115.6 billion from iPhone sales in H1 FY 2024, pushing its lifetime revenue to a whopping $1.95 trillion.

During summer months, many households experience a significant increase in electricity consumption due to higher cooling needs. While staying comfortable during hot weather is essential, it doesn't have to come at the cost of soaring electricity bills. By implementing strategic energy-saving practices, you can reduce your summer electricity expenses without sacrificing comfort.Here you can explore several effective ways to save on summer electricity bills, offering practical tips and strategies that can help you minimise energy consumption and lower your utility costs during the warmer months. From optimising your cooling system to adopting energy-efficient habits, these recommendations are designed to make a noticeable impact on your electricity expenses while keeping your home cool and comfortable.Let's delve into these actionable tips that can help you save money and energy throughout the summer season.The Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) issues BEE Star Labels as a voluntary method for manufacturers to indicate an appliance's energy efficiency. The label uses stars to indicate the efficiency of a product, with more stars indicating higher efficiency. Simply put, the higher the energy efficiency rating of the appliance, the lower its energy consumption. To effectively reduce your home's energy costs, opt for appliances with a 5-star BEE rating. Not only does this positively impact the environment, but it also helps lower your electricity bills. Explore Crompton's wide range of 5-star rated ceiling fans to learn more about BEE Rating Appliances.If your home still uses CFLs and incandescent bulbs, it's time to replace them with LED bulbs. LED bulbs are not just a trendy choice; they are recognized for their energy efficiency and superior illumination. If you're wondering how to reduce your electricity bill at home, switching to LED bulbs is the solution for you.Upgrading to smart appliances is a highly effective method to decrease electricity consumption at home. These devices allow you to automate tasks and manage energy usage efficiently. Consider installing energy-efficient ceiling fans to further reduce electricity consumption. Smart appliances typically come equipped with remote control capabilities, allowing you to schedule operations and conserve power. Crompton offers remote-controlled fans designed for enhanced energy savings and lower power consumption.These energy-efficient fans are gaining popularity due to their brushless direct current motors (BLDC), which operate on direct current electricity. They can help save up to 60% on electricity compared to normal induction motor-based fans. Additionally, they offer convenient features like remote control for turning the fan on and off, timer functionality, and compatibility with voice assistants. To learn more about the differences between BLDC fans and normal fans and how they can help reduce electricity bills, explore further information on BLDC fans versus conventional fans.Implementing a full solar power system for your home can be a substantial investment. However, there are more accessible and cost-effective ways to leverage solar energy. Installing outdoor solar lights in your balcony and garden, along with solar fans, can notably reduce your energy expenses at a modest cost. Additionally, using solar pumps for daily tasks can contribute to electricity savings. It's beneficial to understand the distinction between an electric geyser and a solar geyser to make an informed choice for your energy needs.Maintain your air conditioner at 24 degrees Celsius to optimise cooling and conserve energy during the summer months, effectively lowering electricity costs. Additionally, using a timer to automate AC operation and upgrading to a 5-star BEE-rated model can further enhance energy efficiency and reduce expenses associated with cooling your space.Numerous advanced smart energy metres are currently offered in the market. These metres typically use Wi-Fi connectivity to monitor overall power usage within a home and provide real-time analysis of consumption patterns. Additionally, they can detect power leaks and identify high-energy-consuming appliances. Wi-Fi LED bulbs represent an excellent choice for reducing electricity usage.Regularly servicing and maintaining your home appliances is essential for optimal functionality and efficiency. Appliances that are not properly maintained are known to consume excessive energy, so routine maintenance can prolong their lifespan and reduce energy consumption. Learn more about the importance of cleaning exhaust fans.Install a power strip if you have several electronic devices or appliances that need to be plugged into a single electrical outlet.
