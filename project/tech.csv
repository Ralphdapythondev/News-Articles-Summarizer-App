Read Chinese billionaire Alibaba founder Jack Ma's 'pep talk' memo to employees on the company's 25th anniversary,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/read-chinese-billionaire-alibaba-founder-jack-maas-pep-talk-memo-to-employees-on-companys-25th-anniversary/articleshow/113269186.cms,"Facing competition from upstarts like Pinduoduo and Douyin

Alibaba facing regulatory pressure

Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma has urged the company to embrace competition and trust in market forces. In an internal memo marking Alibaba's 25th anniversary, Ma acknowledged the challenges facing the e-commerce giant but emphasized the importance of resilience and innovation.“Many of Alibaba’s business face challenges and the possibility of being surpassed, but that’s to be expected as no single company can stay at the top forever in any industry,” Ma said in a letter sent to employees, seen by The Wall Street Journal.Once a dominant player in China's e-commerce industry, Alibaba has faced increased competition from upstarts like Pinduoduo and Douyin . The company has also been navigating a weakening Chinese economy and subdued consumer sentiment.Ma stressed that competition is essential for growth and industry health. ""Only with competition can we become stronger,"" he said.Ma reiterated Alibaba's ambition to be a long-lasting company, emphasizing the importance of idealistic beliefs and trust in the market. He encouraged employees to remain focused amidst challenges and competition. “The reason we’re Alibaba is because we have idealistic beliefs, we trust the future, believe in the market. We believe that only a company that can create real value for society can keep operating for 102 years,” he said.Ma himself has maintained a low profile since 2020 when financial affiliate Ant Group faced regulatory scrutiny. The memo comes after Alibaba completed a three-year regulatory process in China. IN August, Chinese regulators concluded their evaluation of the company's monopolistic practices and required it to submit compliance reports.In an earlier internal letter, he praised Alibaba's leadership and restructuring efforts following the company's division into six independently run companies.With the completion of its Hong Kong listing conversion and inclusion in a mainland China trading scheme, Alibaba is positioning itself for continued growth and expansion.Alibaba has also been facing regulatory pressure. Chinese regulators said in late August that they have completed their monitoring and evaluation of Alibaba after the company was penalized over monopolistic practices in 2021. Over the past three years, the company has been required to submit self-evaluation compliance reports to market regulators.","Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma has urged the company to embrace competition and trust in market forces.

German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock has heaped praise on Unified Payments Interface (UPI) for its quick payment capabilities. Speaking alongside foreign minister S.

I used your Metro and experienced your modernisation strategy kilometre by kilometre,” Baerbock recalled.She added that she was impressed by UPI after seeing people buying groceries on the streets and using the digital instant payments system to make payments.“I also saw people buying groceries and was very impressed by your Unified Payments Interface, a digital instant payment system. I thought this would be impossible in Germany,” she added“...but we also watched that closely, and we did a big jump compared to our speed here in Germany. Also, with regard to digitalisation, I saw not only that it's possible to pay on the street with digital payments but also I saw unfortunately in our Embassy, in our consulate that we are carrying application forms for Visa still in boxes,” she noted.“So I thought, ‘Okay, I cannot change the payment on the street, but I can definitely change the digitalisation in our ministry’,” Baerbock said.Last year, Volker Wissing, who is minister for transport in Germany, was seen impressed by the UPI system in the viral clip, shared by the German Embassy in India on X. Wissing was seen buying vegetables from a street vendor in Bengaluru and used the UPI system to make the payment.“One of India's success stories is its digital infrastructure.

Impact of public scrutiny

Pavel Durov, CEO of Telegram , has recently become the subject of widespread speculation after older photos of him resurfaced online. These images have led many to wonder whether the billionaire entrepreneur underwent plastic surgery to enhance his appearance. Adding to the intrigue, Durov was recently arrested in France, raising further questions about the man behind the popular messaging app.Pavel Durov, a 39-year-old entrepreneur originally from Russia, is best known as the founder and CEO of Telegram, a messaging app launched in 2013.Telegram quickly gained popularity for its strong emphasis on user privacy, offering end-to-end encryption and other security features that set it apart from competitors. As of now, Forbes estimates Durov's net worth to be around $15.5 billion. Despite his success in the tech industry, Durov has managed to maintain a relatively low profile—until now.Durov's recent arrest in Paris has added a new layer of complexity to his public image. He was detained in France on charges of suspected complicity in running an online platform involved in illicit activities, including child exploitation, drug trafficking, and fraud. While these allegations are serious, it is the sudden focus on Durov's physical transformation that has captured the internet's attention.Pavel Durov has been active on social media platforms like Instagram since 2011, regularly sharing photos from his travels around the world. In his recent posts, Durov appears with a full head of hair and a toned physique, often posing shirtless in various locations. However, these recent images stand in stark contrast to older photos where Durov was seen with a noticeably receding hairline.The drastic change in his appearance has fueled rumours that Durov may have undergone plastic surgery, including a possible hair transplant. A popular post on X (formerly Twitter) by a well-known account shared a side-by-side comparison of Durov's old and new photos, sparking a flurry of online discussions. The post reads, ""Pavel Durov (Telegram CEO) before his hair transplant and plastic surgery,"" and has since gone viral.The speculation around Durov's transformation has been met with a variety of opinions online. On Reddit, users have debated whether the changes in Durov's appearance are the result of surgical procedures or simply better grooming and styling.One Reddit user commented, ""This isn't a hair transplant. His hair is too thick and full to have this kind of drastic change from a HT. Most likely he's wearing a hair system (wig).""Another user added, ""There's speculation that it's not a transplant, but rather a hair system because his hair loss was much more advanced in the first picture, so when the operation happens, the resulting hairdo never looks as full as his.""Some users believe the changes are the result of plastic surgery, with one theorising, ""This is well-done surgery.""However, not everyone is convinced that surgery is involved. One Reddit user opined, ""Honestly, I think a lot of the facial 'changes' are simply due to the much better angle and lighting in the second photo.""As the speculation continues, it's clear that Durov's transformation—whether natural or assisted—has caught the public's eye. The intense scrutiny of his appearance highlights the challenges that come with being in the spotlight, especially for someone as private as Durov. Whether or not he has undergone any procedures, the discussions around his looks reflect a broader societal fascination with image and success.","Pavel Durov, 39, is the founder and CEO of Telegram, a messaging app launched in 2013.

Elon Musk praised Ratan Tata

The legacy of the Tata Nano

Also read

In the realm of business and innovation, few figures command as much respect as Tata Group chairman emeritus Ratan Tata. His influence extends far beyond the Indian corporate world, even garnering admiration from Tesla CEO and X owner Elon Musk . In a 2009 interview with American journalist Charlie Rose , Musk praised Ratan Tata as a ""gentleman and a scholar."" This moment has recently resurfaced, shedding light on Musk's appreciation for Ratan Tata and his ambitious project, the Tata Nano .The Tata Nano was introduced by Tata Motors in 2008 as the world's cheapest car, with a price tag of just Rs 1 lakh (approximately $2,300 at the time). The car was a pet project of Ratan Tata, designed to make automobile ownership accessible to millions of Indians who had never been able to afford a car. The idea was revolutionary—a small, affordable car that would cater to the vast Indian middle class, providing them with a safe and efficient means of transportation.In the interview with Charlie Rose, which took place shortly after the launch of the Tata Nano, the Tesla CEO was asked about his views on Ratan Tata’s efforts to introduce a low-cost car in India. The interview clip, which has recently gone viral, captures Musk's candid response.""Take for a moment Ratan Tata, what he’s doing in India — developing a little sedan for $2300. Where do you put that in the whole equation of where the future of cars is?"" asked Rose.Musk responded with a mix of admiration and caution. He began by acknowledging the brilliance behind the Tata Nano project and the character of Ratan Tata himself.""I think it's a good idea to have affordable cars, but I think the problem with something like the Nano ... I wouldn't say problem because I think, by the way, it is probably a great idea and Ratan is a gentleman and scholar,"" Musk said.However, Musk also expressed his concerns about the long-term viability of such a low-cost vehicle, particularly in the context of rising fuel prices. He pointed out that while the initial purchase cost of the Nano was remarkably low, the cost of running the car—particularly fuel costs—could become a significant issue as gasoline prices continued to rise.""But where it’s going to become challenging in the future is when the price of gasoline rises, the cost of acquiring the car is much less of an issue than the cost of running the car,"" the billionnaire explained.Despite the initial excitement surrounding the Tata Nano, the car faced numerous challenges. One of the most significant issues was its branding. While the Nano was intended to be an affordable vehicle for the masses, it was often labeled as ""cheap"" rather than ""affordable."" This perception problem, combined with safety concerns and competition from other small cars, led to unimpressive sales figures.The Nano’s production was ultimately discontinued in 2018, marking the end of what was initially seen as a groundbreaking project. The car's journey from inception to discontinuation is often cited as one of the biggest marketing failures in the automobile industry.","The Tata Nano was introduced by Tata Motors in 2008 as the world's cheapest car, with a price tag of just Rs 1 lakh (approximately $2,300 at the time) The car was a pet project of Ratan Tata, designed to make automobile ownership accessible to millions of Indians who had never been able to afford a car.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday (September 11) inaugurated the Semicon India summit at the India Expo Mart in Greater Noida. He addressed the gathering, saying that it is “the right time” for the chipmakers across the globe to invest in India.“You are at the right time, at the right place. In the 21st-century Bharat, the chips are never down! And it’s not just that, today’s Bharat assures the world — When the chips are down, you can bet on India!” he told the gathering in his keynote speech.Modi said that the country contributes 20% of the talent in the world of designing, and it is continually expanding.He noted that investments worth more than Rs 1.5 trillion have been made in this sector, and many projects are currently in the pipeline.“We are preparing a semiconductor workforce of 85,000 technicians, engineers, and R&D experts. Bharat’s focus is on making its students and professionals ready for the semiconductor industry,” he highlighted.Modi said that India’s mantra is ‘Increasing the number of chips produced in India’ and for that, the government has taken steps to advance semiconductor manufacturing. The government is providing 50% support for setting up semiconductor manufacturing facilities in the country even as state governments are providing additional support in this regard.“The Semicon India Program is also an excellent initiative.

Elon Musk criticizes Brazil ban on X



Delhi High Court warns Wikipedia

Ola CEO Bhavish Aggarwal has once again reiterated his stance on fostering the Indian technology sector. Aggarwal took to microblogging site X (formerly known as Twitter) to share his views on the latest report of Delhi High Court slamming Wikipedia over non-compliance with Indian laws.In the post, he wrote “Another proof of why we need to build our tech stack in India. These platforms don’t even comply with Indian laws and then even ignore court judgements!”.But he did not stop there.Aggarwal took aim at Elon Musk 's social media platform, Twitter, leveraging the Wikipedia incident to slam the platform. He said “Also, just look at Twitter’s arm twisting of the Brazilian Supreme Court .”“The more we ignore and justify, more we risk,” he further added.Recently, Brazil Supreme Court banned X after a protracted legal battle. The battle started in April this year when Judge de Moraes directed X to suspend several accounts alleged to be disseminating false information. X's refusal to follow this order resulted in the current suspension in addition to a penalty of 50,000 reais (approximately Rs. 7.47 lakh) for any efforts to bypass the ban, including the use of VPNs.Elon Musk reacted to the announcement with fury, dubbing Moraes as ‘evil dictator’.The Delhi High Court threatened Wikipedia to block the website if it doesn’t comply with India’s laws. Justice Navin Chawla delivered the warning during a hearing related to a defamation case filed by news agency ANI against Wikipedia.""If you don't like India, please don't work in India... We will ask government to block your site,"" Justice Chawla declared, as reported by legal news website Bar and Bench.","Ola CEO Bhavish Aggarwal took to X (formerly known as Twitter) to share his views on the latest report of Delhi High Court slamming Wikipedia over non- compliance with Indian laws.

The telecom department’s crackdown on fraud calls and messages continues. The Department of Telecom (DoT) has said that with the help of Sanchar Saathi portal – that enables citizens to report suspicious numbers – has disconnected over 3.5 lakh fraud numbers in the last 15 days and more than ‘one crore fraud numbers’ till date.“Huge 1 crore fraud numbers disconnected via Sanchar Saathi,” DoT said in a post on X.To curb the menace of spam calls , the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has also directed telecom operators to disconnect and blacklist entities using bulk connections for spam calls, including robocalls and pre-recorded calls.“In the last fortnight over 3.5 lakh such numbers have been disconnected and 50 entities have been blacklisted. In addition, around 3.5 Lakh unused/ unverified SMS headers and 12 Lakh content templates are blocked,” the ministry said.“The DoT launched a citizen centric platform, Sanchar Saathi (https://sancharsaathi.gov.in), to fight cyber fraud, enabling citizens to report suspicious calls and messages.

These calls appear to have originated within India but in reality are made by cyber-criminals from abroad by manipulating the calling line identity. DoT and the TSPs also developed a system to identify and block incoming international spoofed calls.As per the ministry, the benchmarks for key parameters like network availability, call drop rates, and packet drop rates are to be gradually tightened to ensure improvement in the network performance.In this regard, TRAI has released its revised regulations, “The Standards of Quality of Service of Access (Wirelines and Wireless) and Broadband (Wireline and Wireless) Service Regulations, 2024 (06 of 2024)’.These regulations will come into effect from October 1, and from 1st April next year, monthly monitoring of the Quality of Service performance of mobile service will be started instead of a quarterly basis.","Government tightens rules to improve network performance.

Bill Gates in upcoming Netflix documentary

Billionaire philanthropist and Microsoft founder Bill Gates has been sounding the alarm for decades, warning the public about looming threats like climate change and cyberattacks.Gates believes that rising tensions could ignite a conflict, and even if we avoid that, a new pandemic is likely within the next 25 years.In a conversation with CNBC Make It, Gates said, A lot of unrest” in today’s world could spark “a major war,” he said. And even “if we avoid a big war ... then, yes, there will be another pandemic, most likely in the next 25 years.”Scientists agree that pandemics are becoming more frequent due to factors like climate change and population growth. The question is not whether another one will happen but whether we will be better prepared than we were for COVID-19.Gates seems not very pleased with the US and other countries for their inadequate responses to the pandemic. He said that the question isn’t whether another pandemic will occur soon — it’s whether nations will be more prepared than they were for the outbreak of Covid-19. “The country that the world expected to lead and be the model fell short of those expectations,” Gates said, referring to the United States. While some progress has been made, Gates believes that the global response is still insufficient. Political divisions continue to hinder efforts to prepare for the next outbreak.In his book, ""How to Prevent the Next Pandemic,"" he outlined recommendations for stronger quarantine policies, disease monitoring, and vaccine development.The upcoming Netflix docuseries ""What's Next? The Future with Bill Gates"" explores the issue of pandemic prevention. In an interview with the former Chief Medical Advisor to the President of the United States Dr. Anthony Fauci , Gates emphasises the moral responsibility of wealthy nations to lead the way in preventing the spread of disease.Fauci shares concerns about the ""crisis of truth"" and misinformation that has eroded public trust in science. However, he remains optimistic that public trust will eventually be restored.","Gates believes that rising tensions could ignite a conflict, and even if we avoid that, a new pandemic is likely within the next 25 years.

Ireland government's 'inflation worries'

The European Union 's (EU) recent ruling demanding Apple pay 13 billion euros ($14.4 billion) in back taxes has sparked mixed reactions in Ireland . While the government seeks to downplay the impact, the country faces concerns about its reputation as a corporate tax haven.Ireland has been a popular destination for multinational corporations (MNCs) due to its low tax rates.The government has vigorously defended its tax policies, arguing that they have contributed significantly to economic growth and job creation. However, the EU's ruling has challenged this narrative.The EU's ruling has raised questions about Ireland's reputation as a tax haven. While some experts believe that the damage is likely to be temporary, the case has highlighted the challenges of balancing economic growth with concerns about tax fairness. As Ireland continues to navigate these complexities, it will be crucial to maintain its attractiveness to foreign investors while addressing the concerns raised by international regulators.While the government has acknowledged the need to pay the back taxes, it has emphasized that the issue is largely a matter of historical significance due to changes in tax laws. Finance Minister Jack Chambers stated that the funds would be carefully considered for future use but would not be added to the upcoming budget.Despite the ruling, Ireland remains a highly attractive location for foreign investment. The country's corporate tax receipts have continued to surge, and it has established a sovereign wealth fund with ambitious growth targets.
