List of Apple devices compatible with Apple Intelligence

Apple announced the next-generation of software updates at WorldWide Developers Conference (WWDC) 2024. At the event, the company finally introduced Apple Intelligence – a set of artificial intelligence ( AI ) features that uses a large language model in the background and on-device processing to understand what people say, write, and do on their devices.Apple has announced that this suite of AI tools will be available with the upcoming iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS 15. According to a code in iOS 18 spotted by Macrmours, the Apple Intelligence features will have a waiting list during the initial limited preview.As per the report, Apple Intelligence is codenamed as Graymatter in iOS 18 operating system. The code has references to a waitlist, with specific strings that say ""Join the Graymatter Waiting List"" and ""Joined Waitlist."" There are also words that refer to it as a ""limited preview.""""While Graymatter is in limited preview, you may experience unusually slow responses when not in a supported region.""This suggests that there will be a waitlist when Apple brings its Apple Intelligence features publicly with iOS 18 later this year.Apple Intelligence will not be available for all users. The features will only be available on the iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max, essentially the only two models that are powered by A17 Pro chip.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk seems to be mighty upset over Apple's partnership with ChatGPT maker OpenAI . In a series of post on social media platform X, formerly Twitter, Musk termed it as an ""unacceptable security violation "".

Starting later this year, iPhone, iPad and Mac users will be able to access ChatGPT for free within iOS 18 , iPadOS18 and macOS Sequoia, without needing a separate account.Tesla CEO continued that visitors will be required to hand over their Apple phones upon arrival at his companies, with the devices stored in a Faraday cage.""If Apple integrates OpenAI at the OS level, then Apple devices will be banned at my companies.

App Lock on iOS 18: How will it help users



Apple ’s next iOS version is set to arrive with multiple new features including a security feature that will allow iPhone users to lock or hide apps. This feature, called Lock App, will be available with iOS 18, which the company introduced at its annual developer conference, WWDC 2024 . Apart from this privacy feature, the Cupertino-based tech giant also announced several new features that are coming to iOS 18 as well as upcoming software updates for other products like Vision Pro, iPads, Macs and more.The developer beta of iOS 18 is available through the Apple Developer Program at developer.apple.com starting today, and a public beta will be available through the Apple Beta Software Program next month at beta.apple.com. iOS 18 will be available later this year in autumn as a free software update for iPhone Xs and later.With the upcoming update, users will be able to lock individual apps for situations they have to hand over their phones to others. Apple’s App Lock feature will provide an extra layer of security by ensuring that if someone tries to access a locked app, they will need to authenticate using Face ID, Touch ID, or a passcode.Additionally, when this feature is enabled on a specific app, its data won’t appear on search results and notifications to maintain user privacy. Apple will also allow users to hide apps they don’t want others to know about. With iOS 18, users will be able to place apps in a hidden, locked folder for added security.Alongside the App Lock feature, iOS 18 will finally allow iPhone users to customise app icons to free them from the grid layout and will offer more personalisation options. With this update, Apple will also offer significant enhancements to Control Center, iMessage, Mail and other key apps to improve the overall user experience.The combination of these new features will ensure that iOS 18 will not only improve security and privacy but will also provide greater flexibility and customisation for iPhone users.","iOS 18 will be available later this year in autumn as a free software update for iPhone Xs and later.

Apple Intelligence coming later this year, but not for all

After years of talking machine learning, Apple is finally embracing artificial intelligence, or should we say generative artificial intelligence. But “Think Different,” so Apple backronym AI to “Apple Intelligence,” that puts generative artificial intelligence that’s “incredibly useful, personal, and relevant” at the core of iPhone, iPad, and Mac .So what exactly is Apple Intelligence , you may ask? For starters, it is a set of artificial intelligence features that uses a large language model in the background and on-device processing to understand what people say, write, and do on their devices. Apple wants to make its devices more helpful and personalised without compromising user privacy.At the heart of Apple Intelligence lies Siri , Apple's virtual assistant. With enhanced natural language understanding, Siri can now maintain conversational context and understand user requests more accurately.Siri will also gain on-screen awareness, allowing it to take actions based on what's happening in an app without requiring additional information from the user. Over time, Siri will be able to understand and take action in more apps.By grounding the AI in users' personal information, such as photos, calendar events, and files, Apple aims to deliver a more intuitive and helpful experience without compromising privacy.The intelligence boasts deep natural language understanding, enabling powerful new writing tools accessible system-wide. With Apple Intelligence, users can automatically rewrite, proofread text, or even set the tone for the text across a range of Apple and third-party apps, including Mail, Notes, Safari, Pages, and Keynote.Not just writing, Apple Intelligence can create cartoon images resembling their contacts and share them through Messages, adding a fun and creative touch to their communications.Remember emojis? Well, they are getting generatively supercharged, and Apple calls it “Genmoji,” a new feature that creates emoji-like reactions for you using AI when you can't find the one you want.Apple is also improving the Photos app with AI. You'll be able to search for specific things in your photos, like a person doing cartwheels. Plus, there's a new feature, Clean Up, which works like Google's Magic Eraser, allowing you to remove a person (also maybe an object) from a photo.Apple Intelligence also introduces automatic notification personalisation so the important one stays on top, and summarisation.There is a new Focus mode called ""Reduce Interruptions,” which uses the artificial intelligence smarts of Apple Intelligence. How is it different than the Focus modes already there? Well, it intelligently analyses notifications and messages to determine their importance and whether are they worthy of interrupting users.In addition to Apple Intelligence, the company announced a partnership with OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT directly into its operating systems. Users will be able to access ChatGPT features within Apple's apps, with paid accounts unlocking additional functionality beyond the free quota.With powers come great responsibilitiesWith artificial intelligence, keeping the user data safe and private is the topmost responsibility, and Cook says that “privacy is the fundamental right,” and it wants to prove “that you can have a powerful AI experience without sacrificing your privacy.On-device processing plays a crucial role in maintaining user privacy. By performing as much data processing as possible on the user's device, Apple minimises the need to send personal information to the cloud. This approach ensures that sensitive data remains secure and under the user's control.For more complex tasks that require additional computational power, Apple Intelligence utilises Apple Silicon-based servers. These servers, as per Apple, are designed to provide the necessary performance while adhering to its strict privacy standards.And yes, all these privacy standards apply to ChatGPT, too unless you are not logged into it.The whole suite of intelligent features will arrive later this year with the upcoming iOS 18 , iPadOS 18, and macOS 15. But, not for all. The Apple Intelligence has some catch to it.So on iPhones, the features will only be available on the iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max, essentially the only two models that are powered by A17 Pro chip. And most probably the newer iPhones coming later this year. While iPad and Mac devices powered by the M1 chip or later will be compatible.","Apple Intelligence is a set of artificial intelligence features that uses a large language model in the background and on-device processing to understand what people say, write, and do on their devices.

How Apple is trying to regain its position in China



Apple has achieved a new milestone in iPhone sales. As per data from Stocklytics.com (seen by Patently Apple), the Cupertino-based tech giant has about to reach the $2 trillion mark in iPhone's lifetime sales. This achievement comes after a recent decline in market share due to competition from Chinese brands like Xiaomi and Huawei.Since its introduction in 2007, this has been Apple’s most successful product as the company keeps updating its smartphones with new models and features.As per Statista data, Apple grossed $78.7 billion from iPhone sales within five years after releasing the first mode. Two years later, in FY 2014, this figure jumped to $101.9 billion and continued rising.The tech giant experienced several challenging years, especially in 2019 and 2020 when consumers worldwide reduced their spending budgets amid the pandemic. The report alsoclaims that iPhone sales have doubled and hit record highs in 2022 and 2023.During those two years, Apple grossed over $405 billion from selling iPhones, the highest figures in its history. Despite the revenue figures dropping slightly in the second quarter of FY 2024, iPhone sales remain strong. Statistics show Apple grossed $115.6 billion from iPhone sales in H1 FY 2024, pushing its lifetime revenue to a whopping $1.95 trillion.In Q1 FY 2009, Apple’s iPhone sales also accounted for about a quarter of Apple’s total revenue. Since then, this figure has more than doubled and hit 50.64% in Q1 2024.China is one of the biggest iPhone markets for Apple. According to a report by Counterpoint, Apple’s iPhone sales declined by more than 19% as Huawei saw 70% year-on-year growth in its smartphone sales in the country.To increase iPhone sales in China, Apple reportedly launched an aggressive discounting campaign on its official Tmall website in China in May. With these discounts, the company aims to fight off growing competition from local brands like Huawei. The latest discounts were steeper than those offered earlier this year.","Apple grossed $115.6 billion from iPhone sales in H1 FY 2024, pushing its lifetime revenue to a whopping $1.95 trillion.

During summer months, many households experience a significant increase in electricity consumption due to higher cooling needs. While staying comfortable during hot weather is essential, it doesn't have to come at the cost of soaring electricity bills. By implementing strategic energy-saving practices, you can reduce your summer electricity expenses without sacrificing comfort.Here you can explore several effective ways to save on summer electricity bills, offering practical tips and strategies that can help you minimise energy consumption and lower your utility costs during the warmer months. From optimising your cooling system to adopting energy-efficient habits, these recommendations are designed to make a noticeable impact on your electricity expenses while keeping your home cool and comfortable.Let's delve into these actionable tips that can help you save money and energy throughout the summer season.The Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) issues BEE Star Labels as a voluntary method for manufacturers to indicate an appliance's energy efficiency. The label uses stars to indicate the efficiency of a product, with more stars indicating higher efficiency. Simply put, the higher the energy efficiency rating of the appliance, the lower its energy consumption. To effectively reduce your home's energy costs, opt for appliances with a 5-star BEE rating. Not only does this positively impact the environment, but it also helps lower your electricity bills. Explore Crompton's wide range of 5-star rated ceiling fans to learn more about BEE Rating Appliances.If your home still uses CFLs and incandescent bulbs, it's time to replace them with LED bulbs. LED bulbs are not just a trendy choice; they are recognized for their energy efficiency and superior illumination. If you're wondering how to reduce your electricity bill at home, switching to LED bulbs is the solution for you.Upgrading to smart appliances is a highly effective method to decrease electricity consumption at home. These devices allow you to automate tasks and manage energy usage efficiently. Consider installing energy-efficient ceiling fans to further reduce electricity consumption. Smart appliances typically come equipped with remote control capabilities, allowing you to schedule operations and conserve power. Crompton offers remote-controlled fans designed for enhanced energy savings and lower power consumption.These energy-efficient fans are gaining popularity due to their brushless direct current motors (BLDC), which operate on direct current electricity. They can help save up to 60% on electricity compared to normal induction motor-based fans. Additionally, they offer convenient features like remote control for turning the fan on and off, timer functionality, and compatibility with voice assistants. To learn more about the differences between BLDC fans and normal fans and how they can help reduce electricity bills, explore further information on BLDC fans versus conventional fans.Implementing a full solar power system for your home can be a substantial investment. However, there are more accessible and cost-effective ways to leverage solar energy. Installing outdoor solar lights in your balcony and garden, along with solar fans, can notably reduce your energy expenses at a modest cost. Additionally, using solar pumps for daily tasks can contribute to electricity savings. It's beneficial to understand the distinction between an electric geyser and a solar geyser to make an informed choice for your energy needs.Maintain your air conditioner at 24 degrees Celsius to optimise cooling and conserve energy during the summer months, effectively lowering electricity costs. Additionally, using a timer to automate AC operation and upgrading to a 5-star BEE-rated model can further enhance energy efficiency and reduce expenses associated with cooling your space.Numerous advanced smart energy metres are currently offered in the market. These metres typically use Wi-Fi connectivity to monitor overall power usage within a home and provide real-time analysis of consumption patterns. Additionally, they can detect power leaks and identify high-energy-consuming appliances. Wi-Fi LED bulbs represent an excellent choice for reducing electricity usage.Regularly servicing and maintaining your home appliances is essential for optimal functionality and efficiency. Appliances that are not properly maintained are known to consume excessive energy, so routine maintenance can prolong their lifespan and reduce energy consumption. Learn more about the importance of cleaning exhaust fans.Install a power strip if you have several electronic devices or appliances that need to be plugged into a single electrical outlet. This allows you to easily turn off all devices at once when they are not in use, preventing unnecessary energy consumption often referred to as ""phantom"" energy loss.One of the simplest and most effective methods to lower electricity costs is by turning off electrical devices such as lights, fans, and air conditioners when they are not in use.","During summer months, many households experience a significant increase in electricity consumption due to higher cooling needs.
