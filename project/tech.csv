Ukraine bans the use of Telegram on these devices,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ukraine-bans-the-use-of-telegram-on-these-devices/articleshow/113558034.cms,"What Telegram has to say

Ukraine has banned the use of Telegram on government-issued devices due to concerns that Russia can use the app to spy on communications and track users, a report has said. The ban was announced by the National Security and Defence Council after the head of military intelligence presented evidence of Russian surveillance capabilities on the platform.According to a report by news agency Reuters, Andriy Kovalenko, head of the security council's centre on countering disinformation, clarified that the restrictions apply only to work phones, not personal devices.The report also says that since the war between Ukraine and Russia broke out in 2022, Telegram has become a critical source of information.The Security Council statement said Kyrylo Budanov, head of Ukraine's GUR military intelligence agency, had provided evidence that Russian special services could access Telegram messages, including deleted ones, as well as users' personal data.""I have always supported and continue to support freedom of speech, but the issue of Telegram is not a matter of freedom of speech, it is a matter of national security,"" Budanov said.Telegram has issued a statement saying it has never disclosed anyone's data.‚ÄúTelegram has never provided any messaging data to any country, including Russia. Deleted messages are deleted forever and are technically impossible to recover,‚Äù Telegram said.It said every instance of what it described as ‚Äúleaked messages‚Äù had been proven to be ‚Äúthe result of a compromised device, whether through confiscation or malware‚Äù.As per Telemetrio database, about 33,000 Telegram channels are active in Ukraine, Reuters report said.President Volodymyr Zelenskiy regularly publishes updates on the war and reports important decisions on Telegram.",Ukraine has banned the use of Telegram on government-issued devices.

Morgan Stanley has more 'bad news' for Europe's biggest chip company,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/morgan-stanley-has-more-bad-news-for-europes-biggest-chip-company/articleshow/113558323.cms,"Intel and slowness in China business hurt

Global semiconductor equipment giant ASML is facing increasing pressure from Wall Street analysts, who are downgrading their earnings estimates for the company. This latest wave of pessimism comes in the wake of a slump in the memory chip market and growing concerns over demand from Chinese chipmakers and Intel . ASML is among the Europe's largest chip companies.Morgan Stanley joined UBS and Deutsche Bank in cutting their targets for ASML's share price, following a significant drop in the company's stock price during the summer months.Analysts cited potential weakness in both the DRAM market and Intel's business, as well as concerns about China's semiconductor capacity overspend.Intel's recent decision to pause its expansion plans in Germany for two years has further dampened sentiment surrounding the semiconductor industry. While ASML is expected to benefit from strong demand for its advanced EUV tools from TSMC in 2025, analysts caution against being overly pessimistic about the company's long-term prospects.Deutsche Bank analysts raised concerns about ASML's China business, which accounted for nearly half of its sales in the second quarter. They suggested that the outlook for spending in China has deteriorated due to overcapacity, and there is a risk that Chinese memory chip makers could be added to the U.S. Entity List, restricting ASML's ability to sell to them.Despite these challenges, Citi remains bullish on ASML, naming it as their top tech pick in Europe. Analysts expect a healthy influx of orders when the company reports its earnings on October 16th.","Morgan Stanley joins UBS and Deutsche Bank in cutting their targets for ASML's share price.

Warning for Google Chrome users: Hackers using this new technique for stealing passwords online,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/warning-for-google-chrome-users-hackers-using-this-new-technique-for-stealing-passwords-online/articleshow/113552827.cms,"How hackers are stealing login info using the malware

How to ‚Äòquit‚Äô Google Chrome‚Äôs Kiosk mode

Researchers have spotted a new way that hackers are using to steal passwords of users of Google Chrome . They install malware that locks the screen, essentially preventing users from accessing any other app on the system.According to a team of researchers at OALABS ‚Äì a malware analysis services company ‚Äì stealers are now using a new type of Google Chrome malware that first locks users out of their system, preventing them from accessing any other apps and then forcing them to type in login credentials like usernames and passwords and then steal them.The malware, dubbed ‚Äò StealC ‚Äô, uses a new technique called ‚ÄúAutoIt Credential Flusher‚Äù that forces victims to enter their Google account details to access the system. The researchers say that this technique has been in use since last month.The researchers claim that StealC uses Chrome‚Äôs Kiosk Mode feature, a functionality designed to restrict user access on public computers by locking them into a fullscreen Chrome window and disabling standard exit keys like F11 and Esc.Used at public places, Kiosk Mode has its elements like toolbars, navigation buttons and the address bar removed from Chrome's interface so that there is no interaction with people. The malware leverages this mode to present users with a seemingly unavoidable page that prompts them to enter their Google account credentials to regain control of their system.Once the unsuspecting individual types in their username and password, this sensitive information is immediately captured and stolen by the StealC malware, an info-stealing program first identified in February of the previous year.If you are affected by this, and are stuck in Chrome‚Äôs Kiosk mode, use keyboard shortcuts like ‚ÄúAlt+F4‚Äù, ‚ÄúCtrl + Shift + Esc‚Äù, ‚ÄúCtrl + Alt + Delete‚Äù and ‚ÄúAlt+Tab‚Äù to exit the mode, or go to Windows Task Manager to quit the app.If you are unable to do it, restart the PC, scan it for any virus or malware and remove them.","Researchers have spotted a new way that hackers are using to steal passwords of users of Google Chrome.

Explained: What is Pharming online scam and tips to stay safe,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/explained-what-is-pharming-online-scam-and-tips-to-stay-safe/articleshow/113547631.cms,"How does pharming work?

Compromised DNS Servers : Hackers often target Domain Name System (DNS) servers, which translate website addresses (URLs) into numerical IP addresses. By compromising these servers, attackers can manipulate the DNS records, directing users to malicious websites instead of the intended destination.

Malicious Code Injection: Attackers may also inject malicious code into legitimate websites, either through vulnerabilities in the website's content management system or by exploiting security flaws in the web server. This code can then redirect users to phishing or malware-infected sites.



Tips to stay safe from pharming:

Verify Website URLs: Always double-check the URL of the website you are visiting. Look for any unusual characters or spelling errors.

Use Reputable Browsers and Antivirus Software: Keep your web browser and antivirus software up-to-date with the latest security patches. Reputable browsers often have built-in security features to protect against phishing attacks.

Be Cautious of Phishing Emails: Be wary of unsolicited emails, especially those asking for personal information or containing suspicious links. Never click on links in emails from unknown senders.

Use a VPN: A Virtual Private Network (VPN) can help protect your privacy and security online by encrypting your internet traffic and hiding your IP address.

Avoid Public Wi-Fi Networks: Public Wi-Fi networks are often less secure than private networks. Avoid using public Wi-Fi for sensitive activities like online banking or shopping.



Pharming is a type of online scam where malicious code is secretly installed on a legitimate website or network server, redirecting unsuspecting users to fraudulent websites. This redirection often occurs without the user's knowledge or consent.Farming does not require you to click on an initial link. It works by putting malicious code into your computer or at an internet server Lebel which automatically redirects you to a fake alternate side when you try to access a legitimate one.This site would be designed to impersonate the genuine site and is aimed to trick you into sharing your credentials.By following these tips, you can significantly reduce your risk of falling victim to a pharming scam and protect your personal information online.","Pharming is a type of online scam where malicious code is secretly installed on a legitimate website or network server, redirecting unsuspecting users to fraudulent websites.

When I had joined, I had shared the quote, ""Wherever you go, becomes a part of you somehow‚Äù. Being a part of IndiGo and now living now in India for two years....IndiGo and this beautiful country India have indeed become a part of me. Bharat ab ghar jaisa lagta hai.

India's essence is captured in its beautiful diversity. Of our 88 domestic cities, I had the pleasure of visiting our great teams in 30. From Thiruvananthapuram in the south to Leh in the north. My most recent visit was to Leh, where walking with my son at 18,000 feet at the Khardung La Pass was very special considering my roots are from a country where the highest ""hill"" is some 300 metres only and around 25% of the land is below sea level üòä

Here are some pictures from my travels in the last two years. Can you guess the cities?

Shark Tank judge Anupam Mittal has responded to Indigo CEO Pieter Elbers ‚Äô post celebrating two years of being in India and Indigo. In a LinkedIn post , Elbers wrote ‚ÄúBeing a part of IndiGo and now living now in India for two years....IndiGo and this beautiful country India have indeed become a part of me.

He started his career at KLM in 1992 as Manager Aircraft loading.Mittal replied to the post saying ‚ÄúAap bhi ab ghar wale jaise lagte ho‚Äù.

EY employee's death: Anna Sebastian's father appeals to the company,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ey-employees-death-anna-sebastians-father-appeals-to-the-company/articleshow/113534810.cms,"Made appeal to EY

Family not planning to take EY to court

What Anna's mother wrote in the letter

Sibi Joseph, father of Anna Sebastian Perayil , the 26-year-old EY employee who died due to 'work-related stress' recently broke his silence. In an interview to news agency IANS, he said that said that his daughter was ""hardly getting any sleep and was unable to eat proper food"". Joseph said that his daughter, who was involved in an audit of Bajaj Auto, would often work past midnight and return to her paying guest accommodation around 1.30 am.Anna's death has created an uproar, triggered by the letter written by her mother, Anita Augustine, to EY chairman Rajiv Memani that went viral on social media. In the letter, Augustine voiced her concerns regarding the excessive workload placed on her daughter, a newcomer to the company, and indicated that Anna ultimately succumbed to work-related stress. Anna had joined the company in March, after completing CA, and passed away on July 20.Joseph said that recently, four officials of Ernst and Young (EY) visited their home in Kangarapady, Kochi. In the meeting, Sebastian's parents made an appeal to the company to terminate the employees who were responsible for their daughter's untimely demise. Joseph said, ""Four EY officials had come here, and we reiterated our concerns to them.""Joseph, however, said that the family has no intention of pursuing legal action against the company. He clarified that the letter's purpose was to raise awareness among the company's top executives to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.How Anna's mother's letter sent in July got leaked in SeptemberAnna's mother had sent a letter to EY chairman in July, just days after her death. The letter, meant as a private correspondence, was leaked from EY‚Äôs Pune office. The reason of the leak Anna‚Äôs father believes is that others within the company may be facing similar work-related stress and want the issue to be brought to public attention. ""The letter was leaked from EY's Pune office, which means there are many people similarly suffering in the company who want the letter to be out in public,"" Joseph said.Anna Sebastian Perayil, who passed her CA exams in 2023, worked at EY Pune office for four months before she succumbed. Anna's mother wrote an emotional letter to the EY Chairman alleging that her daughter's demanding work schedule contributed to her death. She expressed concerns over the intense workload placed on her daughter, a newcomer to the company, highlighting the toll of working long hours without breaks, including on Sundays. This case has raised questions about employee welfare and the pressures faced by young professionals.In the letter, the mother said ""‚ÄúBurdening newcomers with such backbreaking work, making them work day and night, even on Sundays, has no justification whatsoever. She had just left her hometown and loved ones. Everything was new to her‚Äîthe organization, the place, the language‚Äîand she was trying very hard to adjust. You should show some consideration to new employees. Instead, the management took full advantage of the fact that she was new and overwhelmed her with both assigned and unassigned work.‚Äù‚ÄúAnna was always a fighter, from childhood through her academic years, where she excelled in everything she did. She was a school topper, and a college topper, excelled in extracurricular activities, and passed her CA exams with distinction. She worked tirelessly at EY, giving her all to meet the demands placed on her,‚Äù the mother said in the letter further.","Anna Sebastian Perayil, 26, died due to 'work-related stress' on July 20.

What are IT Amendment Rules, 2023

In a significant ruling, the Bombay High Court on Friday (September 20) declared the amended Information Technology (IT) Rules unconstitutional and struck them down. These rules aimed to identify and control fake content on social media about the government.The case was brought before Justice Chandurkar due to differing opinions within the previous division bench.While Justice Patel had previously struck down the rules, citing concerns about censorship, Justice Gokhale upheld them, claiming no adverse impact on free speech. Justice Chandurkar ultimately sided with Justice Patel's view.Justice A S Chandurkar , who was appointed as a ‚Äòtie-breaker judge‚Äô after a division bench provided a split verdict earlier this year, concluded that the rules violated Articles 14, 19, and 19(1)(g) of the Constitution, concerning equality, freedom of speech and profession, respectively.‚ÄúI have considered the matter extensively. The impugned rules are violative of Article 14 (right to equality), 19 (freedom of speech and expression) and 19(1)(g) (freedom and right to profession) of the Constitution of India ,‚Äù the judge said.Justice Chandurkar specifically criticised the vagueness of the terms in the rules, saying that the expression ‚Äúfake, false and misleading‚Äù in the Rules was ‚Äúvague and hence wrong‚Äù in the absence of any definition.In April 2023, the government introduced in the IT Amendment Rules, 2023, changes to the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 that will allow the government to establish Fact-Check Units (FCUs) that will be tasked to identify and flag potentially false or misleading content related to its work on the social media platforms.According to these rules, if the FCU identifies any posts containing fake, false, or misleading information about the government's activities, it will report these posts to social media platforms. The platform then has two choices: remove the post or add a disclaimer. If they choose to add a disclaimer, they lose their legal protection and could face legal consequences.","The Bombay High Court on Friday (September 20) declared the amended Information Technology (IT) Rules unconstitutional.

The EU 's competition watchdog announced that Apple must comply with the Digital Markets Act (DMA) within six months or face potential penalties.EU competition chief Margrethe Vestager announced that the commission is using specification proceedings for the first time under the DMA to guide Apple towards effective compliance.The move aims to compel Apple to re-engineer its services, allowing rival companies access to the iOS and iPadOS ecosystems.The proceedings target two main areas: iOS connectivity features for devices like smartwatches, headphones, and virtual reality headsets, and Apple's process for addressing developers' requests for third-party interoperability with iOS and iPadOS.The commission aims to specify how Apple should provide effective interoperability, allowing non-Apple devices to easily pair and connect with iPhones and receive notifications. This move is designed to ensure fair and open digital markets, with a focus on smartphone operating systems playing a crucial role.Apple responded by saying it has created ways for developers to request additional interoperability while protecting user security. The company warned that undermining built-in protections could put European consumers at risk.""Undermining the protections we've built over time would put European consumers at risk, giving bad actors more ways to access their devices and data,"" Apple said in the statement to Reuters.This action follows a preliminary finding in June that Apple had breached DMA rules by not allowing App Store developers to freely inform users about alternative payment options outside its ecosystem.Apple has already made several changes to comply with the DMA, including opening up iOS and iPadOS to third-party app stores and allowing developers access to its NFC technology.If Apple fails to comply, the EU may launch a formal probe that could lead to fines of up to 10% of the company's global annual sales.

Tips to stay safe from WhatsApp video call scam

A Bengaluru man has fallen victim to a sophisticated online scam, losing Rs 59 lakh. The scammers, who spoke fluent English, staged a fake court trial to convince the victim that he was involved in a legal dispute and required a hefty payment to settle the matter.KJ Rao, a Bengaluru resident revealed that he received an automated call on September 11, threatening to block his mobile numbers.Subsequently, he was connected to a person posing as a crime branch officer from Colaba, Mumbai, who falsely accused him of money laundering .After this, Rao received a WhatsApp video call from a person, who was dressed as a police officer. The fake officer claimed that Rao's Aadhaar details had been misused, reinforcing the belief that he was indeed involved in illegal activities. Despite Rao's willingness to report to the local police, he was instructed to stay put.The fraudsters then claimed to transfer the call to a CBI office, where Rao was informed that he was under digital arrest . Following the instructions of the scammer, KJ Rao confined himself to his room and was subjected to constant surveillance via a Skype call.KJ Rao was subsequently connected to a fabricated courtroom setting, where a person impersonating a judge presided over a false trial. The victim was falsely accused of various charges and instructed to transfer a substantial sum of Rs 59 lakh to multiple accounts, allegedly in compliance with a ""court order"" and Reserve Bank of India guidelines.""The crooks didn't let me sleep the whole night as they kept a watch over Skype. My mind just went blank and I didn't have a friend or family member to share my plight with,"" Rao told TOI.The next day, he transferred Rs 50 lakh and Rs 9 lakh to two different bank accounts.The scammers abruptly ended the Skype call around 2:30 PM on September 13th, shortly after KJ Rao had completed the fraudulent money transfers. It was at this point that the victim realised he had been duped and immediately went to the Indiranagar police station to file a complaint.* If you receive a video call from an unknown or unexpected number, be cautious and do not answer immediately. Verify the caller's identity through other means before accepting the call.* Use alternative methods to confirm the caller's identity, such as calling them back on a known number or checking their social media profiles.* Never share personal information, including your financial details, passwords, or identification documents, with anyone you meet online, even if they appear to be legitimate.* Scammers often create a sense of urgency to pressure victims into making hasty decisions. If someone asks you to make a quick payment or transfer money, be cautious and verify the request.* If you believe you have been targeted by a scammer, report the incident to the platform's support team and the relevant authorities.","KJ Rao, a Bengaluru resident revealed that he received an automated call on September 11, threatening to block his mobile numbers.
