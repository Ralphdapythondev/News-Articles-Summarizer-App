Today, the Pune Tech Hub plays a crucial role in supporting Mastercard’s vital global operations across payment safety, cybersecurity, fraud detection, and digital identity.The company said that the launch of Mastercard’s new campus will support several goals within the government’s “Viksit Bharat” vision, which seeks to transform India into a fully developed, technologically advanced economy by 2047—the 100th anniversary of the country’s independence. Already, the Pune workforce has been supporting the way in delivering technological solutions for India’s domestic market.

How largest stock broking platform Groww's tax bill and loss is a result 'relocating' to India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-largest-stock-broking-platform-growws-tax-bill-and-loss-is-a-result-relocating-to-india/articleshow/114438709.cms,"Why Groww moved its headquarters to India

When Groww overtook Zerodha

Bengaluru-based fintech startup Groww has reportedly incurred a significant loss due to its recent shift from a US-based parent entity to an Indian one. According to a report in Economic Times, ""Stock broking platform Groww paid Rs 1,340 crore ($160 million) in taxes, as it flipped its parent entity from the US to India in May this year. The tax payout resulted in Groww clocking a net loss of Rs 805 crore for the financial year ending March 31, 2024.At an operational level the fintech reported a profit of Rs 535 crore up from Rs 458 crore in FY23.""Despite this, Groww's operational performance remained strong, with a profit of Rs 535 crore in FY24, up from Rs 458 crore in FY23. Groww’s biggest rival, Zerodha, recorded a net profit of Rs 4,700 crore on revenues of Rs 8,320 crore for FY24, according to chief executive Nithin Kamath.Founded in 2016 as a mutual fund investment platform, Groww expanded into stock trading in 2020. Last year, it further diversified into consumer lending, payments and asset management through subsidiaries.Groww's decision to relocate to India aligns with the country's regulatory framework. Local financial regulators prefer companies and their subsidiaries to be based within the country. Additionally, the prospect of an initial public offering plays a crucial role in this move. Other fintech firms like Razorpay and Pine Labs are also considering similar moves.The company's revenues grew by 119% to Rs 3,145 crore in FY24, driven primarily by its core broking business, which saw a 124% increase. Groww's recent focus on expanding into margin trading and other financial services highlights its efforts to diversify its revenue streams and compete effectively in the Indian market.In September 2023, Groww overtook Zerodha as the largest broking platform in India with 6.63 million active investors compared to the rival’s 6.48 million. By May 2024, Groww’s active client base surpassed 10 million, making it the first discount broker in India to reach this milestone.","Groww paid Rs 1,340 crore ($160 million) in taxes, as it flipped its parent entity from the US to India in May.

The All India Consumer Products Distributors Federation ( AICPDF ) has filed a complaint with India's antitrust authority, Competition Commission of India ( CCI ), alleging that quick commerce companies Zomato's Blinkit , Swiggy , and Zepto are engaging in predatory pricing practices.All India Consumer Products Distributors Federation represents 400,000 retail distributors, including Nestle and Hindustan Unilever.In the letter dated October 18, AICPDF complained to the antitrust body that quick commerce companies were practising predatory pricing - or offering deep discounts and selling below cost to lure customers.The complaint claims that these companies are offering deep discounts and selling products below cost to attract customers, making it difficult for traditional retailers to compete. This, in turn, is harming the livelihoods of countless small businesses.The quick commerce sector, which has seen rapid growth in India, offers delivery of various products within 10 minutes or less. While this has reshaped consumer behaviour, it has also raised concerns about its impact on traditional retail.The AICPDF's complaint highlights how quick commerce companies are bypassing traditional distributors and forming direct relationships with consumer goods companies. This practice, they argue, is unfair and threatens the survival of small retailers.The Competition Commission of India (CCI) is now investigating the matter. If the CCI finds merit in the complaint, it could take action against the accused companies.This development comes at a time when the quick commerce sector is experiencing significant growth. Zomato's shares have doubled this year, and Swiggy is preparing for a major IPO. However, the allegations of predatory pricing could cast a shadow over the industry's future.","All India Consumer Products Distributors Federation (AICPDF ) has filed a complaint with India's antitrust authority, Competition Commission of India ( CCI ), alleging that quick commerce companies Zomato's Blinkit, Swiggy, and Zepto are engaging in predatory pricing practices.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114438522,imgsize-156652,width-400,resizemode-4/114438522.jpg"

Leaked iPhone SE 4 images hint at iPhone 14-like design,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/mobiles-tabs/leaked-iphone-se-4-images-hint-at-iphone-14-like-design/articleshow/114411596.cms,"Image courtesy: Macotakara

Images of alleged iPhone SE 4 dummy units have surfaced online, sparking speculation about the upcoming budget phone 's design and potential for a larger size option.The images, shared by Japanese tech blog Macotakara, showcase dummy units resembling the recently released iPhone 14 . This suggests the iPhone SE 4 could ditch the older design language in favour of a more modern look, featuring flat edges, a smaller notch for the Face ID system, and a single rear camera.The dummy units reportedly have the same dimensions as the current iPhone SE (146.7mm x 71.5mm x 7.8mm), hinting at a familiar form factor. However, the report also mentions the existence of a larger dummy unit, potentially hinting at an "" iPhone SE 4 Plus "" variant with a size similar to the iPhone 14 Plus (6.7-inch display).While Macotakara acknowledges that the existence of a Plus size option is unconfirmed, the possibility has piqued the interest of fans who may favour a larger display on a budget-friendly iPhone.It's important to note that these are leaks based on dummy units, not official confirmation from Apple. While the iPhone 14-inspired design seems likely, the existence of a Plus size model remains unverified.Apple is typically tight-lipped about upcoming products, so fans will need to wait for an official announcement to know for sure what the iPhone SE 4 will look like and what features it will offer.","Images of alleged iPhone SE 4 dummy units have surfaced online.

Apple co-founder Steve Jobs talked about AI 40 years ago: Here’s a video,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-co-founder-steve-jobs-talked-about-ai-40-years-ago-heres-a-video/articleshow/114403621.cms,"This is what is he talks about AI

And so we’re finding the way we’ve built computers in the past isn’t working for the kinds of things we want to do in the future. And we’re examining new architectures, these fancy words like non–von Neumann machines, etcetera. And what we’re doing is we’re starting to look to the human brain. How is the human brain architected? And we’re finding that computers are very good at doing very simple things extremely accurately. And the human mind is very good at doing very complex things adequately. And there’s a ton of people now starting to look to the brain as a model of an architecture to build a computer.

The main differentiation that exists now between the two machines, and I’m going to use the word “machine” to describe the brain for a moment, is that man is self-conscious, obviously. We are conscious that we’re conscious: “I am thinking.” And to our knowledge, no computer or any even of the high primates has yet to say, “I am thinking.”

And so a tremendous amount of work is going on in the artificial intelligence community to try to understand what self-consciousness is, to try to understand if a computer can ever be self-conscious. But I think the biggest thing that motivates a lot of us is, unlike what we just heard, we don’t know. We honestly don’t know whether we are more than just a machine.

And we are building better and better computers. We’re running up against roadblocks. A lot of people are spending the best parts of their lives right now to try to understand the architecture of the brain and how we can make better and better machines to emulate it. And I actually think, by the end of our lifetimes, we’re going to know the answer to this question. And that’s what’s driving a lot of us.

While artificial intelligence as a technology may have picked up steam after the launch of ChatGPT two years ago, the concept is far from new. Apple founder Steve Jobs , a visionary in the tech world, predicted the potential of AI as far back as 40 years ago, envisioning machines that may answer questions and think like humans.On the Steve Jobs Archive , there’s footage from 1983 in which Jobs is talking to people at the International Design Conference in Aspen.The old video shows what Jobs thought about computers at that time, how books may be replaced by computers one day and the amount of work that is being done to understand the architecture of the brain to help machines emulate it.You can watch the video and a bunch of others using this link",Apple founder Steve Jobs predicted the potential of AI as far back as 40 years ago.

Positive but remains cautious

LTIMindtree, India's sixth-largest technology services company, is reportedly focusing on larger clients and leveraging artificial intelligence ( AI ) to secure significant market share. A company executive told Economic Times that LTIMindtree recently won its largest deal ever, a result of its AI-centric approach.Nachiket Deshpande, the company's chief operating officer, stated that AI is being integrated into all services.This strategic shift has led to a surge in large deals, including the record-breaking manufacturing contract . “We are now embedding AI into each of our service, reimagining with AI… Bulk of our large deals that we announced this quarter came because of that differentiated AI offering. This is one of our largest deals in the history of the company, that we signed with a manufacturing client,” said Deshpande in an interaction with ET.In the second quarter of fiscal year 2025, LTIMindtree secured several multi-year projects, including a $200 million deal from a U.S.-based manufacturer. Despite a slight decline in quarterly revenue , the company's large deal pipeline remains robust at over $5 billion.Deshpande explained that the AI-focused approach has enabled LTIMindtree to consolidate multiple vendors into a single provider. Additionally, the company is carefully evaluating smaller clients and may reduce its involvement if strategic improvements are not achieved.While cost reduction remains a significant driver of growth, Deshpande emphasized the company's focus on winning larger market share with existing clients.LTIMindtree, formed in 2022 from the merger of L&T Infotech and Mindtree, reported a 3.2% quarter-over-quarter revenue growth in the second quarter. Despite this positive trend, the company remains cautious about the outlook due to seasonal factors and potential macroeconomic challenges.The company's margin target of 17-18% may be delayed due to factors such as wage hikes and geopolitical tensions. Deshpande acknowledged these challenges but expressed confidence in the company's long-term growth prospects.","LTIMindtree is reportedly focusing on larger clients and leveraging artificial intelligence ( AI ) to secure significant market share.

Canada-based tech company removed from list

The US added over two dozen entities in Pakistan, China and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to its trade blacklist which means that these companies will now be prohibited from obtaining US goods and technology without government approval, a report has said.According to news agency AFP, the 26 entities – including nine entities from Pakistan, six from China and 3 from UAE – are said to have violated export controls by allegedly being involved in weapons and drone development programs in Pakistan and Iran, as well as supporting Russia amid its war with Ukraine.The Commerce Department has accused these entities of violating export controls, participating in "" weapons programs of concern,"" or evading US sanctions on Russia and Iran.“We remain vigilant in protecting US national security from bad actors. Today’s actions send a clear message to those who violate our controls: they will face consequences,” said Alan Estevez, Under Secretary of Commerce for Industry and Security, in a statementThe AFP report says that nine entities in Pakistan have been accused of acting as front companies and procurement agents for the previously blacklisted Advanced Engineering Research Organization . Since 2010, this group has allegedly acquired US-origin goods by concealing their true end users, including a Pakistani entity linked to the country’s cruise missile and drone programs.“This conduct undermines the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States,” the Commerce Department stated.Similarly, six entities in China have been blacklisted for allegedly obtaining US products to advance China’s military modernisation. Additionally, three entities in the UAE and one in Egypt were accused of trying to procure US components to bypass sanctions imposed.The Commerce Department also announced the removal of Canada-based Sandvine from the entity list. The company had been blacklisted in February 2024 after its technology was used for alleged mass web monitoring, censorship and targeting of human rights activists. Sandvine was removed after it took steps to prevent further misuse of its technology.","The US added over two dozen entities in Pakistan, China and the United Arab Emirates to its trade blacklist.

said Jared Spataro - CMO, AI at Work.

First, the ability to create autonomous agents with Copilot Studio will be in public preview next month.

Second, we’re introducing ten new autonomous agents in

Dynamics 365

to build capacity for every sales, service, finance and supply chain team.

Microsoft takes on Salesforce with AI agents

Microsoft has announced that it will empower its AI customers to create their own autonomous AI agents starting next month. These agents, unlike traditional chatbots, require minimal human intervention and are designed to automate various tasks, such as handling customer inquiries, the company said at the “AI Tour” event in London.The company is positioning these agents as “apps for an AI-driven world”.To simplify the creation process, Microsoft is providing Copilot Studio , an application that requires minimal coding knowledge.The agents will utilise a combination of AI models developed by Microsoft and OpenAI. Furthermore, Microsoft is offering ten pre-built agents for common tasks like supply chain management, expense tracking, and customer communication, making it even easier for businesses to get started.Last month, Salesforce launched Agentforce Partner Network - the world's first AI agent ecosystem that allows its partner companies to build third-party AI agents to undertake specific tasks depending on the requirements of businesses. These AI agents will be available for installation and deployment.The news comes a few days after Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff criticised Microsoft’s AI solutions , calling them “disappointing”.He said that Microsoft Copilot “doesn’t work, and it doesn’t deliver any level of accuracy.”“Major analyst firms say it’s spilling data everywhere, and customers are left cleaning up the mess. To add insult to injury, customers are then told to build their own custom LLMs. I have yet to find anyone who’s had a transformational experience with Microsoft Copilot or the pursuit of training and retraining custom LLMs. Copilot is more like Clippy 2.0,” he said in a post on X.","Microsoft launches Copilot Studio to let customers create their own AI agents.

The new ‘30-minute’ delivery trend



Zomato-owned quick commerce platform Blinkit is reportedly expanding beyond its 10-minute grocery delivery service. The company may be planning to offer a new category of high-value items which will be delivered in 30 minutes. This move comes as the rapid delivery market matures and companies seek new avenues for profitability.For this expansion, Blinkit is reportedly setting up larger ""express dark stores"" to accommodate bulkier items like instant water heaters, air purifiers, and jewellery.According to a report by Moneycontrol, these express dark stores will be around 7,000 to 8,000 square feet in size, compared to the 3,000-4,000 square feet of their standard dark stores. This reported shift will allow Blinkit to cater to a wider range of customer needs and even increase order values.In a statement to Moneycontrol, an anonymous source has claimed:As per the report, Blinkit boasts a higher average order value (AOV) than its competitors Swiggy Instamart and Zepto. AOV is a key metric for quick commerce profitability, and Blinkit leads the pack with Rs 614 per order, while its rivals fall in the Rs 450-480 range. This suggests Blinkit is in a stronger position to capitalise on the growing demand for rapid delivery services.Blinkit’s move follows industry trends towards longer delivery times for improved profitability, as seen with Tata's BigBasket also considering 30-minute deliveries for expensive goods. While 10-minute deliveries remain crucial, experts believe 30-minute options will increase quick commerce adoption.

Why Britain is facing warnings of an exodus from technology companies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-britain-is-facing-warnings-of-an-exodus-from-technology-companies/articleshow/114427878.cms,"What is worrying technology CEOs

British may see exodus of technology companies, warn some analysts. Reason: likely hike in capital gains tax (CGT), proposed by Finance Minister Rachel Reeves . According to a report in CNBC, technology entrepreneurs and investors are expressing deep concern over the government's speculated plans to significantly increase capital gains tax. They fear that such a move could force many entrepreneurs to leave the UK, jeopardizing the nation's vibrant startup ecosystem.Recent reports suggest that Finance Minister Rachel Reeves is considering raising the capital gains tax rate to as high as 39%, a move that would make the UK's tax regime less competitive compared to other European countries.While Prime Minister Keir Starmer has denied these claims, the looming budget announcement on October 30 has heightened anxiety within the tech community.In addition to the capital gains tax hike, the government is also exploring plans to reduce the business asset disposal relief (BADR), which currently allows entrepreneurs to pay a lower tax rate on the sale of their businesses. These combined tax changes could severely impact the incentives for entrepreneurs to start and grow businesses in the UK.Several prominent figures in the tech industry, including Giles Andrews of Zopa, Rishi Khosla of OakNorth, and Victor Riparbelli of Synthesia, have signed an open letter urging the government to reconsider these plans. They argue that higher capital gains tax and restrictions on BADR would make the UK less attractive to entrepreneurs, leading to a potential brain drain.Venture capitalists and investors also share these concerns. Adam French of Antler and Harry Stebbings of The Twenty Minute VC have both warned of the potential for a mass exodus of entrepreneurs if the government proceeds with the proposed tax changes.However, not everyone agrees that increasing capital gains tax is a bad idea. A recent report by the Institute for Public Policy Research suggests that many millionaire business owners would support such a move, believing that it would be fair and equitable.The debate over capital gains tax has significant implications for the UK's tech industry. If the government proceeds with the proposed changes, it could have a chilling effect on entrepreneurship and innovation, potentially harming the country's economic growth.","Finance Minister Rachel Reeves is reportedly considering raising capital gains tax to as high as 39%.

Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi recently appeared on tech podcast – Hard Fork where he discussed the company’s position in the autonomous vehicle industry. In the podcast, the interviewer asked Khosrowshahi whether Uber considers Tesla a competitor following its “We, Robot” event. To which Khosrowshahi responded “Well, they certainly could be, right? If they develop their own AV vehicle and they decide to go direct only through the Tesla app, they would be a competitor”.For those unaware, Uber partnered with Waymo in 2023 to bring autonomous ride-hailing services to the Phoenix customers.Earlier this month, the Uber CEO told Financial Times that the company is open to partnering with Tesla.

The feud between comedian Kunal Kamra and Ola CEO, Bhavish Aggarwal has taken another turn after Kamra highlighted a fresh allegation against the ride-hailing company.Kamra shared a post on X (formerly known as Twitter) claiming the presence of bouncers at Ola service centres . This follows his earlier criticism of the company's electric scooter service, which sparked a public spat with Ola CEO Bhavish Aggarwal.In his latest post, Kamra shared a screenshot of a user's message alleging that Ola had deployed bouncers at service centres. The user claimed to have witnessed bouncers arguing with customers, including female customers. Kamra sarcastically tagged Aggarwal in his post, questioning the need for bouncers and implying that the service was so poor it required security to manage customer frustration.“Please can a journalist fact check this. If true this is truly unique - Sales team for sales & Bouncers for after sales,” reads the post.While Ola has not yet publicly responded to Kamra's latest allegation, the incident has reignited discussions about Ola's customer service and its handling of electric scooter issues.Several users have commented on his post, sharing their own negative experiences with Ola.

During a dig in 1936, paleontologist Llewellyn Ivor Prince found a theropod (a carnivorous, bipedal dinosaur) specimen at the Santa Maria Formation in southern Brazil. Thanks to radiocarbon dating of sediments surrounding the fossil, during the late Triassic period, about 225 million years ago. Also called the “Southern Cross Lizard,” the dinosaur was named after the Southern Hemisphere constellation.

From the findings we have, the Staurikosaurus was large for an early dinosaur — it was around 2 meters long, 80 cm tall, and weighed 30 kg, which is close to the weight of a large dog. Staurikosaurus had a long tail and ran on two legs, and its fossils suggest that it was quite fast for its size. The predator also had serrated teeth that were curved towards the back of its throat, which helped with catching and holding prey.","The Staurikosaurus was a carnivorous, bipedal dinosaur.

Other AI tools that Meta is releasing

Meta , the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, recently announced that it is releasing new AI models, including a “Self-Taught Evaluator”, from its research division. Among other things, this AI model uses AI to evaluate other AI models, potentially reducing the need for human involvement in the development process.Meta's Self-Taught Evaluator is nothing but a “chain of thought” reasoning technique, which is used by OpenAI's latest model OpenAI o1 that is claimed to offer reasoning while responding.As per a report by news agency Reuters, this approach breaks down complex tasks into smaller, more manageable steps, improving accuracy in areas like mathematics, scientific analysis, and coding.What sets Meta's model apart is that it's trained entirely on AI-generated data, eliminating the reliance on human-labeled data.Notably, this approach of AI model may pave the way for more autonomous AI systems capable of self-improvement. By learning from its own mistakes, AI could become increasingly accurate and sophisticated without constant human intervention.“We hope, as AI becomes more and more super-human, that it will get better and better at checking its work, so that it will actually be better than the average human,” said Jason Weston, one of the researchers.This may also streamline the development process and potentially lead to more powerful and efficient AI applications.“The idea of being self-taught and able to self-evaluate is basically crucial to the idea of getting to this sort of super-human level of AI,” he added.In addition to the Self-Taught Evaluator, Meta also released other AI tools, including an update to its Segment Anything image identification model, a tool to accelerate response times in large language models, and datasets to aid in the discovery of new inorganic materials.","Meta's Self-Taught Evaluator is nothing but a “chain of thought” reasoning technique.
