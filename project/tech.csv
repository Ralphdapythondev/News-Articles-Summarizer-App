"Meta announces layoffs across WhatsApp, Instagram, and other teams",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/meta-announces-layoffs-across-whatsapp-instagram-and-other-teams/articleshow/114298284.cms,"Meta Platforms , the social media giant behind Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp , confirmed that it is laying off employees across several key divisions, including its core social media platforms Instagram and WhatsApp. The company fired 11,000 employees in 2022 and around 10,000 professionals were sacked in 2023. The exact number of employees affected is not yet known, but reports suggest the cuts are part of a wider effort to streamline operations and reduce costs.This news comes amidst recent reports highlighting slowing user growth and increased competition for Meta's core social media platforms.The company has also faced criticism for its handling of user data privacy and the hefty investments poured into its nascent virtual and augmented reality projects under Reality Labs.Jane Manchun Wong, a well-known reverse engineer and social media expert, announced on Threads that she has been laid off from Meta. “I’m still trying to process this but I’m informed that my role at Meta has been impacted. Thank you to everyone, especially my Threads and Instagram teammates, for my wild journey at Meta. If anyone is interested in working together esp on software/security engineering, please reach out via my email, LinkedIn, etc noted on my personal website,” reads the post.“Today, a few teams at Meta are making changes to ensure resources are aligned with their long-term strategic goals and location strategy. This includes moving some teams to different locations, and moving some employees to different roles. In situations like this when a role is eliminated, we work hard to find other opportunities for impacted employees,” company spokesperson Dave Arnold told The Verge.The specific teams impacted within WhatsApp, Instagram, and Reality Labs remain unclear. However, industry analysts suggest the layoffs might target departments like product development, engineering, and business operations to streamline workflows."," Meta Platforms is laying off employees across several key divisions, including its core social media platforms Instagram and WhatsApp. The exact number of employees affected is not yet known, but reports suggest the cuts are part of a wider effort to streamline operations and reduce costs.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114298279,imgsize-2899111,width-400,resizemode-4/114298279.jpg"
This 10-year-old fintech major may be staring at cash crisis,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/this-10-year-old-fintech-major-may-be-staring-at-cash-crisis/articleshow/114293310.cms,"More than $250 million fall in valuation

What's hurting Lendingkart

Lendingkart, a prominent MSME-focused lending platform, is reportedly negotiating a significant valuation cut with its existing investor, Fullerton Financial Holdings (FFH), due to a cash crisis and challenges in the unsecured loan market. According to a report in Economic Times, "" Lendingkart is staring at a massive valuation cut amid a cash crisis that has hit the MSME-focused lending platform over the past few months due to stress in the unsecured loan market."" The ET report quotes people familiar with the development said.The company, which was valued at $350 million during its last funding round four years ago, is now seeking a new funding deal at a much lower valuation of $100 million. Fullerton, which already holds a substantial stake in Lendingkart, is considering increasing its ownership to become the majority shareholder.Despite a successful turnaround following the pandemic, Lendingkart has faced difficulties in recent months. The company's financial performance has been impacted by factors such as increased credit costs, the Reserve Bank of India 's regulations on first loss default guarantees, and a shift towards co-lending arrangements with other lenders.The co-lending model, while helping Lendingkart expand its assets under management, has also limited its revenue potential and profitability. The company's net profit has declined in recent years, and it is now seeking additional equity capital to strengthen its financial position.Investors in the fintech lending sector are becoming more cautious, favoring companies with strong track records in traditional lending and a demonstrated ability to navigate market challenges. Lendingkart's reliance on partner lenders and its recent financial performance may be hindering its ability to attract new investors.As Lendingkart faces these challenges, other fintech lenders, such as Flexiloans, Aye Finance, and Indifi, have managed to secure funding from global investors. The overall fintech funding landscape has slowed down, but there are still opportunities for well-positioned companies to raise capital.","Lendingkart, a prominent MSME-focused lending platform, is reportedly negotiating a significant valuation cut.

What's hurting ASML

ASML Holding NV, the Europe's most valuable technology company, has lost its position. The chip major has been dethroned by software giant SAP SE following a significant drop in its market capitalization. The Dutch chip-machine maker's shares plummeted after it issued a disappointing guidance update, citing delays in chip plant construction and lower-than-expected orders.The company's market capitalization has decreased by over €60 billion since Tuesday's announcement, marking one of the largest one-day value losses in European history.This decline has allowed SAP to surpass ASML in terms of market value, a position ASML has held for several years.SAP has been experiencing strong growth, fueled by increased demand for its cloud-based solutions and AI applications . The company recently announced a restructuring plan to further integrate AI into its software offerings. SAP shares have risen 52% this year as the company benefited from a surge in cloud revenue growth, in part fueled by rising demand for artificial intelligence apps.Incidentally, this is not the first time that ASML has lost its position to SAP, the last time ASML lagged behind SAP in terms of market capitalization was in the year 2020.ASML's struggles are also attributed to the potential for stricter US export controls on its business in China and the overall weakness in the semiconductor sector. Its customers, including Intel and Samsung Electronics, have been cautious about their spending amid economic uncertainty.The company's recent financial results were further impacted by a technical error that led to the premature release of its earnings report. ASML is now scheduled to hold a conference call with investors on Wednesday.As ASML grapples with these challenges, SAP's continued success and rising market value solidify its position as a leading European technology company.","ASML Holding NV, the Europe's most valuable technology company, has lost its position.

Amazon may bring this US subscription model for Prime Video to India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/amazon-may-bring-this-us-subscription-model-for-prime-video-to-india/articleshow/114287676.cms,"What the company said



Why Amazon is planning this move



Amazon Prime Video is reportedly planning to introduce advertisements for viewers in India starting next year. According to a report by Bloomberg, this move mirrors a change which the company has already implemented in the US. The report claims that Prime Video subscribers in Indian can expect to see ads interrupting their shows and movies as Amazon seeks to offset the costs of producing and acquiring content.With this move, the company is reportedly aiming to generate more revenue to drive content investments in the rapidly expanding and competitive streaming market.In a latest statement, Amazon noted that Prime Video aims to have ""meaningfully fewer"" advertisements than other streaming providers and TV channels, while increasing ""investments over a long period of time"" on its titles.The company also pointed out that there will be an ad-free option as well. However, the pricing for the same will be shared later by Amazon.However, the company has reportedly confirmed that no changes will be made to Prime Video's current price in Indian in 2024. It currently offers subscriptions for Rs 799 per year. This means users have two more months to renew their Prime Video subscription before Amazon increases the price of the plans.This move comes as Reliance and Disney has finalised a mega-merger that will control nearly half of India's streaming users, intensifying the battle for subscribers. Despite cutting back in other markets, Amazon continues to invest heavily in India, where Prime membership sign-ups have outpaced the rest of the world.The introduction of ads, which are projected to generate $5 billion in revenue this year in the US, will provide additional funding for content acquisition and production in the price-sensitive Indian market, where competitors like JioCinema offer subscriptions for as low as a penny per day.",Amazon Prime Video is reportedly planning to introduce advertisements for viewers in India starting next year.

One of the most popular tourist cities in Europe is planning a freeze on Airbnb licences,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/one-of-the-most-popular-tourist-city-in-europe-is-planning-a-freeze-on-airbnb-licences/articleshow/114286074.cms,"Why the big freeze on Airbnb licences

Hungary 's government is reportedly considering a moratorium on new Airbnb licences and a tax increase on short-term apartment rentals in its capital city Budapest. According to a report by news agency Reuters, quoting the country's economy minister, ""Hungary's government is considering a plan to impose a moratorium on new Airbnb licences in Budapest and to raise taxes on short-term apartment rentals in the capital city.""This comes in response to growing concerns about the impact of short-term rentals on housing prices and the character of the city.The announcement, made by Economy Minister Marton Nagy , follows a recent vote by residents in Budapest's sixth district to ban short-term rentals starting in 2026. This is the first such ban in one of Europe's most popular tourist destinations.Budapest has seen a surge in short-term rentals in recent years, with Eurostat data showing it was the most popular city for such stays in 2023. The government's proposed measures aim to regulate the market and address concerns raised by local residents.While no final decision has been made, Nagy indicated that the government is leaning towards imposing a moratorium and increasing taxes on short-term rentals in Budapest. He emphasised that the goal is to ensure that the short-term rental market is sustainable and does not contribute to housing affordability issues. ""We are thinking about a possible moratorium and a tax hike in Budapest,"" Nagy reportedly said at a press briefing.""The Airbnb market will change, and it is sure that it cannot grow further,"" he is reported to have added.The proposed changes would not affect short-term rental properties outside of the capital city, and the government is currently negotiating with tourism industry trade organisations to finalise the details of the new regulations.","Hungary's government is reportedly considering a moratorium on new Airbnb licences and a tax increase on short-term apartment rentals in its capital city Budapest.

Jio and Airtel wanted spectrum auction

Telecom Minister clarifies

Starlink CEO and X (previously Twitter) owner Elon Musk posted that Starlink ‘will do our best to serve the people of India’. Musk was responding to the announcement made by union telecom minister Jyotiradtiya Scindia that satcomm spectrum will be allocated administratively and not auctioned. “BREAKING: India’s government said it will allot spectrum for satellite broadband administratively and not via auction, hours after Elon Musk criticized the auction route being sought by billionaire Mukesh Ambani Good News for Starlink,” X user DogeDesinger wrote in a post.Replying to the post, Musk wrote “Much appreciated! We will do our best to serve the people of India with Starlink.”Earlier this week, both Jio and Airtel called for a revised approach to spectrum allocation for satellite communication companies in India. In a letter to the telecom minister, Jio emphasised that satellite companies should acquire spectrum through a transparent auction process, similar to traditional telecom players. Speaking at IMC 2024, Bharti Airtel Chairman Sunil Mittal favoured bidding for such allocation.Musk then termed their demand as ‘unprecedented’.Telecom Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia said on Tuesday that such airwaves will be given out through administrative allocation and not auctioned. ""Satellite spectrum across the world is allocated administratively. So, India is not doing anything different from the rest of the world. Conversely, if you do decide to auction it then you would be doing something, which is different from the rest of the world,"" the minister said.""That does not mean that spectrum does not come without a cost. What that cost is and what the formula of that cost is going to be, will not be decided by you or me ...it will be decided by Trai...and there is a paper that has already been circulated by Trai, and we have a regulatory authority for telecom, and that regulatory authority of telecom has been empowered by the constitution to decide what that administrative pricing is going to be,"" he said.","Telecom Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia said on Tuesday that such airwaves will be given out through administrative allocation and not auctioned.

“I think it’s a good idea to have

Intel and Advanced Micro Devices ( AMD ) are coming together to form a group, aiming to find new ways to expand the x86 ecosystem by enabling compatibility across platforms. This is seen as a response to the challenge posed by Arm Holdings – a British company whose designs are being used by chip designers such as Apple and Qualcomm.Talking about the evolving landscape which is characterised by dynamic AI workloads , custom chiplets, and advancements in 3D packaging and system architectures, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said that the company “is on the cusp of one of the most significant shifts in the x86 architecture and ecosystem in decades – with new levels of customisation, compatibility and scalability needed to meet current and future customer needs.”“We proudly stand together with AMD and the founding members of this advisory group, as we ignite the future of compute, and we deeply appreciate the support of so many industry leaders,” Gelsinger added.“Establishing the x86 Ecosystem Advisory Group will ensure that the x86 architecture continues evolving as the compute platform of choice for both developers and customers,” added Lisa Su, AMD Chair and CEO.Intel invented the x86 computing architecture technology that has been used to power laptops, PCs and data centre servers all over the world. AMD licences the technology from Intel and also makes chips using x86, competing directly against Intel under a longstanding legal settlement.As per news agency Reuters, the market share of both these firms has been eroded by Arm, which allows all Arm chips to run all Arm software, regardless of who made the chip – Apple, Qualcomm, as well as Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet that use it in data centres.Intel and AMD have been using x86 technology in their chips but software sometimes must be tweaked to work across their offerings. The “advisory group” includes members like Broadcom, Dell Technologies, Lenovo Group and Oracle, among others, as founding members.The group aims to unify the x86 ecosystem, improve compatibility and boosting Innovation.“To achieve this, the group will solicit technical input from the x86 hardware and software communities on essential functions and features. Collaboration will facilitate the creation of consistent and compatible implementations of key x86 architectural features and programming models, extending across all sectors – including data centers, cloud, client, edge and embedded devices – ultimately delivering downstream benefits to customers,” it said.At a developer event hosted by Lenovo in Seattle, Intel Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger said x86 technology can readily be adapted for uses such as new laptops with AI features.","Intel and AMD have been using x86 technology in their chips.

Binance has assisted Delhi Police in successfully cracking down a scam operated by a fraudulent entity called “M/s Goldcoat Solar .” The operation led to the arrest of multiple individuals and the seizure of over 100,000 USDT in cryptocurrency assets. In a release, the world’s largest crypto platform noted that these scammers falsely claimed to have secured rights from the Ministry of Power , to contribute to India's plan to expand solar power capacity to 450 gigawatts (GW) by 2030, all under the guise of supporting the country’s renewable energy efforts.Binance claimed that the scheme deceived several users into believing they could invest in the national energy plan and earn substantial returns.The scam gained traction through social media platforms, where the scammers promoted ""M/s Goldcoat Solar"" as a legitimate investment opportunity. They impersonated high-level government officials, and even used the names of high dignitaries, to falsely endorse the scheme. Victims were shown fabricated proofs of earnings, allegedly from earlier investors, to legitimise the scheme and build trustDuring the investigation, the Delhi Police discovered that the scammers had been using multiple SIM cards, which were activated using the identities of innocent individuals. These fake SIM cards were distributed in bulk while some were being sent overseas to facilitate scams through communication channels. The scam relied heavily on the widespread use of these SIM cards obtained with fake documents for the scammers to hide their identities.The scammers funnelled money deposited by the victims through various bank accounts, with a portion of the funds being converted into cryptocurrency which added further challenges to investigators.Delhi Police asked Binance to assist them with the investigation during a sharing session. Through a series of virtual meetings, Binance provided analytical support, helping investigators follow the money trail.Jarek Jakubcek , Head of Law Enforcement Training at Binance, said:","Binance has assisted Delhi Police in successfully cracking down a scam operated by a fraudulent entity called “M/s Goldcoat Solar.” The operation led to the arrest of multiple individuals and the seizure of over 100,000 USDT in cryptocurrency assets.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114278802,imgsize-59190,width-400,resizemode-4/114278802.jpg"

Ola Electric comes under govt scrutiny

Ola Electric has bought in consulting services firm EY India to spearhead a ‘ service transformation ’ in response to growing after-sales service challenges, increasing customer complaints, and falling sales volumes, ET reports. Quoting sources familiar with the matter, the report said that about a dozen executives from EY came on-board at Ola Electric a few weeks ago on deputation for the three-month project.They are expected to provide guidance across various service-related areas, including optimizing business processes and improving spare parts inventory management for the Bhavish Aggarwal electric vehicle maker. The project’s tenure, it says, can be extended depending on the outcome.“EY is helping Ola in streamlining the business processes, inventory management of spare parts and improving an on-ground presence in places where it has sales but no service,” the report cited a source. Aggarwal is closely involved in the whole process with the team, the person said.Earlier this month, the Central Consumer Protection Authority issued a show cause notice to Ola Electric for alleged violation of consumer rights, misleading advertisement and unfair trade practices. The show-cause notice points to user complaints such as manufacturing defects, partial or no refunds on booking cancellations, recurring defects despite servicing, overcharging, inaccurate invoices, and multiple issues with batteries and vehicle components.Last week, the Ministry of Heavy Industries (MHI) directed the Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI) to provide detailed inputs regarding consumer complaints against the EV maker.Ola Electric has been grappling with increased customer complaints over after-sales service. As per National Consumer Helpline data 10,644 complaints against Ola e-scooters were received from September 1, 2023, to August 30, 2024. Of these, 3,389 relate to service delays, 1,899 pertain to delays in the delivery of new vehicles, and 1,459 involve unfulfilled promised services.","Ola Electric has bought in consulting services firm EY India to spearhead a ‘ service transformation ’ The move is in response to growing after-sales service challenges, increasing customer complaints, and falling sales volumes.

As India-Canada ties worsen, memes went viral on social media. Here are some of the viral ones:

Government on Canada's allegations

The diplomatic crisis between India and Canada deepened as Ottawa accused New Delhi of involvement in the killing of a Sikh separatist, Hardeep Singh Nijjar . Canada hinted at possible sanctions against India and claimed to have evidence linking Indian government agents to the killing. The Canadian government also alleged ties between the Bishnoi gang and Indian government agents, accusing them of carrying out covert operations and violent activities in Canada.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau blamed India for ""targeted campaign against Canadian citizens by agents linked to the government of India"" with his British counterpart, Keir Starmer . In response to the escalating tensions, Canadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly did not rule out imposing sanctions on India, stating that ""everything is on the table.""India vehemently rejected Canada's accusations, denying any involvement in the Sikh leader's killing or any other criminal activities in the country. Official sources in India stated that Canada's claim of sharing evidence in the Nijjar case was false.Prime Minister Trudeau's allegations that India was engaging in covert operations targeting Canadian nationals were also dismissed by Indian authorities. At a press conference, Trudeau accused India of threatening and killing Canadian citizens on Canadian soil, vowing that Canada would not tolerate such actions.In retaliation for Canada's accusations, India expelled six Canadian diplomats and withdrew its high commissioner from Canada.

"Telecom minister makes it clear: Spectrum for satcom will be allocated administratively, but not 'free'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/telecom-minister-makes-it-clear-spectrum-for-satcom-will-be-allocated-administratively-but-not-free/articleshow/114259102.cms,"What concerns do Jio and Airtel have

Musk calls auction “unprecedented”

Telecom Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia on October 15 clarified the government’s stand on the satcom spectrum issue. He said that spectrum will not be auctioned but allocated administratively and service providers will have to pay a cost.“The Telecom Act 2023 which was passed in December of last year has very clearly put this in Schedule 1 which means that satcom spectrum will be allocated administratively,” Scindia said at India Mobile Congress while responding to a question at a media briefing.According to a report by news agency PTI, Scindia, however, he made it clear that radiowaves will come with a cost even if assigned without auction for satellite-based communications services.“That does not mean that spectrum comes without a cost. What that cost is and what the formula of that cost is going to be will not be decided by you and me but it will be decided by Trai,” he added.“We have a regulatory authority for telecom and that regulatory authority has been empowered by the constitution to determine what that administrative pricing is going to be? I am very confident that they will come up with the best pricing that should be adopted provided that it is being given in an administrative manner,” Scindia added.The development essentially means that the demand of Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel and service providers to auction satcom spectrum has been rejected. Scindia’s comments come hours after Bharti Airtel founder and chairman Sunil Bharti Mittal joined rival Reliance Jio in seeking allocation of spectrum for satcom services in the same manner as it is allocated to telecom players.Both the telecom giants have sought a fair and transparent auction system for satellite services to ensure level competition.Reliance Jio has called for a revised approach to spectrum allocation for satellite communication companies in India. In a letter dated October 10 to Telecom Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia, Jio urged a reconsideration of the current proposal, citing concerns about fair competition with established telecom operators.Elon Musk's Starlink , Amazon's Kupier, Bharti Group-backed OneWeb Eutelsat, and SES-Jio joint venture have expressed interest to provide their services in India, which will directly compete with land based mobile networks.Jio emphasised that satellite companies like Starlink and Amazon's Kuiper should acquire spectrum through a transparent auction process, similar to traditional telecom players – pay licensing fees, mirroring the obligations of existing telecom providers.Sunil Mittal, chairman of Bharti Airtel, echoed this sentiment at the India Mobile Congress, stating that satellite companies offering services in urban areas should participate in spectrum auctions. Airtel also reiterated its stand and shared a letter it wrote to the telecom department in March.On October 14, Musk reacted to Reliance Jio’s reported move to urge the government for transparent auction for satellite spectrum.“That would be unprecedented, as this spectrum was long designated by the ITU [International Telecommunication Union] as [a] shared spectrum for satellites,” Musk said.Scindia spoke on similar lines that satellite spectrum across the world is allocated administratively.“India is not doing anything different from the rest of the world. Conversely, if you do decide to auction then you are doing something which is different from the rest of the world,” he said“Satellite spectrum is a very high level of spectrum beyond 7-8 Ghz is shared spectrum. If spectrum is shared then how can you price it individually? I think there are a number of issues that go into decision making which is why globally all countries of the world are following a certain model and India is doing pretty much the same,” the minister added.",Telecom Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia on October 15 clarified the government’s stand on the satcom spectrum issue.

The deliberations remain fluid, and no final decisions have been made.This development comes on the heels of a recent Commerce Department rule that could ease AI chip shipments to data centres in the Middle East. The new rule allows data centers to apply for Validated End User status, enabling them to receive chips under a general authorization rather than requiring individual licences.Last year, the US government extended licensing requirements for advanced chip exports to over 40 countries, including some in the Middle East, citing risks of diversion to China and arms embargo considerations.The potential new restrictions would further tighten controls on the global distribution of cutting-edge AI technology.
