Why this fintech company is ‘unhappy’ with Facebook-parent Meta,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-this-fintech-company-is-unhappy-with-facebook-parent-meta/articleshow/113950751.cms,"What Revolut said about Meta’s fraud prevention policy



“These platforms share no responsibility in reimbursing victims, and so they have no incentive to do anything about it. A commitment to data sharing, albeit needed, simply isn’t good enough,”

What Meta said about its framework for banks



“Fraud is a multi-sector spanning issue that can only be addressed by working collaboratively. We encourage banks including Revolut to join in this effort,”

UK-based fintech firm Revolut has criticised Facebook-parent Meta for its approach to prevent fraud on its social media platforms. The company has suggested that the social media giant should directly compensate users who fall victim to scams on its platforms like Facebook and Instagram. This criticism comes in response to Meta's recent announcement of a data-sharing partnership with UK banks NatWest and Metro Bank which is aimed at preventing fraud.Revolut dismissed this initiative as insufficient, stating it ""falls woefully short of what’s required to tackle fraud globally.” Revolut believes that Meta needs to take greater responsibility for the scams that take place on its platforms and provide financial restitution to those affected.Starting October 7, new regulations in the UK will require banks and payment firms to compensate victims of authorised push payment (APP) fraud up to 85,000 GBP (nearly US$111,000). This type of fraud occurs when scammers trick individuals into authorising payments to accounts controlled by criminals.This call for greater accountability from social media companies comes after the UK's Payments System Regulator lowered the maximum compensation amount from a proposed 415,000 GBP (nearly US$ 545,000) following pushback from the financial industry.In a statement to CNBC, Revolut’s head of financial crime , Woody Malouf, criticised Meta’s plans to tackle financial fraud on its platforms. Malouf said that the social media company’s fraud prevention policies amount to “baby steps when what the industry really needs is giant leaps forward.”he added.A recent report by Revolut also highlights the significant role Meta's platforms play in online fraud . The fintech firm found that 62% of user-reported fraud on its platform originated from Meta's properties, including Facebook and WhatsApp.Specifically, Facebook was identified as the source of 39% of reported scams, while WhatsApp accounted for 18%. While the percentage of Meta-originated fraud has slightly decreased from 64% last year, it remains a significant concern.In an email statement to CNBC, a Meta spokesperson said that its intelligence-sharing framework for banks “is designed to enable banks to share information so we can work together to protect people using our respective services.”the email added.",UK-based fintech firm Revolut has criticised Facebook-parent Meta for its approach to prevent fraud on its social media platforms.

"These 'fake' trading apps on your iPhones, Android smartphones are helping hackers to steal your money",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/these-fake-trading-apps-on-your-iphones-android-smartphones-are-helping-hackers-to-steal-your-money/articleshow/113946187.cms,"What is ""Pig Butchering"" scam

What are the 'fake' trading apps

How hackers targeted users

Hackers are running a sophisticated ""pig butchering"" scam operation using a bunch of fake trade apps that are available for download on both the Google Play and Apple App Store , a new report from cybersecurity firm Group-IB has claimed. These apps have helped hackers trap thousands of victims before they were detected and removed from both the platforms.If you have them on your phones, it is advised that you uninstall them right away.According to the report, these fraudulent apps -- dubbed the "" UniShadowTrade "" malware family by researchers -- were present as legitimate trading platforms, luring users into a deceptive investment scheme, commonly known as ""Pig Butchering"".These scams involve cultivating trust with victims over time, often through social media or dating apps, before introducing them to a fake investment opportunity. The scammers manipulate victims into depositing funds onto a fraudulent platform that displays fabricated high returns. When victims attempt to withdraw their ""profits,"" they discover the money is gone, and the scammers have vanished.Researchers at Group-IB discovered that the UniShadowTrade apps were built using the UniApp framework and first appeared in May. On iOS, the fraudulent app was called ""SBI-INT,"" while Android users were targeted with ""Finans Insights"" and ""Finans Trader6."" These apps were downloaded over 5,000 by Android users before their removal.To deceive users, the apps initially disguised themselves as legitimate tools. On iOS, SBI-INT posed as an app for ""algebraic mathematical formulas and 3D graphics volume area calculations.""The Android versions presented themselves as financial news aggregators. However, once installed, these apps redirected victims to fake trading platforms accessible only through invitation codes.The scammers employed social engineering tactics, often grooming victims through conversations on dating apps to gain their trust. The fraudulent apps even requested users upload personal documents like national IDs and passports, impersonating legitimacy to the scheme while simultaneously stealing sensitive information.The researchers say that while the apps have been removed from the respective app stores, hackers have shifted their distribution method to phishing websites , continuing to target unsuspecting victims.The cybersecurity firm also notes that the UniShadowTrade apps are capable of mimicking a wide range of legitimate cryptocurrency and trading platforms, advising users to exercise caution.","Hackers are running a sophisticated ""pig butchering"" scam operation using a bunch of fake trade apps that are available for download on both the Google Play and Apple App Store.

The service, which aims to deliver meals from popular restaurants within a 2-kilometre radius, is now live in select locations of Bengaluru, Chennai, Hyderabad, New Delhi, Mumbai, and Pune.Rohit Kapoor , Swiggy's head of food delivery, stated, ""Ten years ago, Swiggy revolutionised food delivery by cutting average wait times to 30 minutes.Now we're reducing that wait even further for frequently ordered items.""Swiggy has partnered with over 2,700 restaurants, including global chains such as KFC , McDonald's , and Starbucks , to offer quick-to-prepare items to customers for delivery under Bolt. The service focuses on reducing wait times for frequently ordered items like coffee, burgers, and biryani .Notably, Swiggy has emphasised that its delivery partners will not face penalties or receive incentives based on Bolt order timings. For Swiggy's delivery partners, Bolt orders are treated like any other order, as they are not informed of the distinction between Bolt and regular orders.This launch intensifies competition in India's fast-growing quick-commerce market. Swiggy's move comes as rival Zomato discontinued its own 10-minute delivery service in January 2023.Swiggy plans on expanding the 10-minute food delivery to more cities across the country. “The rest of India, watch out for this rolling out to you asap,” said Kapoor.The introduction of Bolt coincides with Swiggy's preparations for its Initial Public Offering (IPO). The company recently received shareholder approval to increase its fresh issue size from Rs 3,750 crore to Rs 5,000 crore. Swiggy is expected to target a valuation between $10 billion to $13 billion when it goes public in the coming months.","Bolt aims to deliver meals from popular restaurants within a 2-kilometre radius.

Indonesia bans the Chinese app that was most-downloaded app in US in 2023,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/indonesia-bans-the-chinese-app-that-was-most-downloaded-app-in-the-us-in-2023/articleshow/113948565.cms,"Temu's business model against Indonesian rules

Indonesia will continue its ban on the operations of the e-commerce platform Temu, citing concerns that it could harm the country's small businesses. According to a report in Channelnewsasia, Communications and Informatics Minister Budi Arie Setiadi stated that Temu's business model, which involves direct sales from factories to consumers, violates Indonesian trade regulations requiring intermediaries.He emphasized that allowing Temu to operate would negatively impact the economy and society, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises.The Indonesian government has been closely monitoring Temu's attempts to enter the Southeast Asian market. The platform, owned by PDD Holdings , has faced multiple failed registration attempts due to trademark conflicts and regulatory non-compliance. Temu was the most-downloaded iPhone app in the US in 2023. The Chinese shopping app took over spots previously held by the US tech giant Facebook parent Meta. With its tagline “Shop like a billionaire,” Temu has reportedly captured almost 20% of the US market share, posing a challenge to traditional American retailers such as Amazon.com, Dollar Tree Inc and Five Below Inc.Temu's business model of selling products directly from factories to consumers is said to be against Indonesia’s trade regulation requiring an intermediary or distributor, the Trade Ministry’s domestic trade director-general Isy Karim said previously. Minister Budi said that allowing Temu in Indonesia could hurt the economy and society.Temu’s application became a topic of discussion after the company appeared at the 2024 E-commerce Expo held on Sep 24 and 25 in Greater Jakarta.Temu, which is available in about 60 countries, entered Southeast Asia last year, beginning with the Philippines last August and Malaysia last September. It expanded into Thailand in July this year. In October 2023, Indonesia also banned TikTok Shop , citing the need to protect smaller merchants and user data.",Indonesia will continue its ban on the operations of the e-commerce platform Temu.

Hong Kong retreated after a recent surge fueled by China's economic stimulus measures.The Indian stock market bled on Thursday, October 3. The impact was felt on Dalal Street with Sensex falling over 1,700 points as investors feared the impact of the war on crude oil prices and global supply chains.

Viral response to the Mark Zuckerberg’s interview

Memes history and evolution

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently offered an interesting and humorous insight into his personal take on memes , the popular digital form of humour that has become ubiquitous across social media platforms. During an interview, Zuckerberg was asked about his favourite meme—a question that led to a candid and lighthearted response from the typically reserved tech leader.In a video shared by Pubity, the text read, “We asked Mark Zuckerberg what his favourite meme is.” Zuckerberg, chuckling at the question, admitted that the memes he had in mind were not “acceptable publicly.” He further referenced a recent viral video, indicating that he stays up-to-date with current trends in online culture.Zuckerberg also took the opportunity to highlight how he uses Meta’s own platforms, such as WhatsApp and Threads , to share memes with his close friends. His acknowledgment of using Meta-owned platforms for personal communication led to amusing commentary from viewers. One viewer remarked, ""Such a wild thought to think bro has group chats with his homies on his own app,"" showcasing the humour around Zuckerberg's everyday use of the very products his company created.The video of Zuckerberg's interview quickly gained traction online, sparking various reactions. While some viewers found his remarks relatable and down-to-earth, others saw his mention of Meta's messaging services as a clever promotion. Zuckerberg’s relaxed approach and genuine enjoyment of memes provided a rare glimpse into his personal life, a side not often shown by high-profile tech leaders.The concept of memes is far from a recent phenomenon. Although they are now synonymous with internet culture, the origins of memes predate the digital age. According to a 2022 report by the New York Times, linguists believe that humans have been using memes for communication for centuries, long before the advent of social media. The term “meme” itself derives from the French word “même,” meaning “same,” and the Greek word “mimoúmai,” which translates to “to imitate.”Memes have always been about imitation and replication, whether in language, culture, or, more recently, through viral digital content. Zuckerberg’s acknowledgement of the power and prevalence of memes further emphasises their role in shaping modern communication, especially on platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp—key services under Meta’s umbrella.","Zuckerberg was asked about his favourite meme in an interview.

Facebook parent company Meta has announced an AI model called Movie Gen that can create real-looking video and audio clips on the basis of text prompts by users. This AI tool is similar to Sora – offered by ChatGPT maker OpenAI and Veo by Google.

“I will be joining @GoogleDeepMind to work on video generation and world simulators! Can't wait to collaborate with such a talented team. I had an amazing two years at OpenAI making Sora. Thank you to all the passionate and kind people I worked with. Excited for the next chapter!”

How Google welcomed Brooks



What is a world simulator and how it works



One of the co-leads on OpenAI 's video generator, Sora, has departed the company to join Google DeepMind . Tim Brooks , who led Sora 's development alongside William Peebles , announced his move to Google's AI research division on social media platform X (earlier Twitter). Brooks said that he will continue his work on video generation technologies and ""world simulators” in Google DeepMind.In the X post, Brooks wrote:Replying to Brook’s X post, Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis shared a welcome note. He said: “Thrilled to welcome @_tim_brooks to @GoogleDeepMind. So excited to be working together to make the long-standing dream of a world simulator a reality!!”Google DeepMind describes “world simulators” as AI models that are capable of generating interactive virtual worlds. The company applied it to its recently released Genie model, which can create playable and controllable virtual environments from various sources, including synthesised images, real photographs, and even simple sketches.In a 2023 research paper, DeepMind explains: “Applications of a real-world simulator range from controllable content creation in games and movies to training embodied agents purely in simulation that can be directly deployed in the real world.”Brooks, who co-led the Sora project from its inception in January 2023, played a crucial role in shaping its research direction and large model training. His departure comes at a critical time for Sora, which is reportedly facing technical challenges that could hinder its competitiveness against rival video generation systems.These challenges include slow processing times, with early versions of Sora reportedly taking over 10 minutes to generate a one-minute video clip. While OpenAI is reportedly working on an improved version, Brooks' departure may impact the project's progress.Google also has its video generation model, Veo, which was unveiled at the I/O developer conference earlier this year. The company recently announced that Veo will soon be integrated into YouTube Shorts which will enable creators to generate backgrounds and short video clips.","Tim Brooks, who co-led the development of OpenAI's video generator, Sora, has left the company to join Google DeepMind.

How fraudsters target users and how to safeguard

Fraud calls are becoming a widespread problem, exploiting unsuspecting individuals through deception and manipulation. While the tactic is generally used to 'extort' money, one such call led to the death of a government school teacher in Agra. According to a report, a teacher died due to cardiac arrest that was reportedly triggered by a fraud phone call she received from scammers who falsely claimed that her daughter is involved in a sex scandal .According to a report by news agency PTI, cyber fraudsters posing as a police inspector, threatened to expose the fabricated scandal unless the teacher, identified as Malti Verma, paid them Rs 1 lakh.On September 30, the fraudsters allegedly threatened the teacher and demanded Rs one lakh to not disclose the matter, the family of the teacher said.“On September 30, she got a Whatsapp call at 12 pm in which they said that her daughter was caught in a sex scandal and began threatening her for the future consequences of revealing her daughter's identity,"" the teacher’s son was quoted as saying.The report added that the teacher’s son assured her it was a scam.“After that, she talked to me over [the] phone and informed me about the call. But when I checked the phone number, I told my mother that it was a fraud call from cyber criminals,” he added.“After that I also talked to my sister and found everything normal. I asked my mother not to worry because she was a victim of cyber fraud , but she could not control her tension and her health deteriorated after that call,” he said.Despite her son's reassurance and confirmation that her daughter was safe, Verma experienced severe anxiety and chest pain after the call. Her condition rapidly deteriorated, and she was pronounced dead at the hospital.“When her health began deteriorating, we took her to a hospital, where doctors declared her dead due to cardiac arrest,"" he said.Fraudsters often employ sophisticated tactics like caller ID spoofing to appear legitimate on calls. The scammers impersonate government officials, bank representatives, or even tech support personnel – that adds legitimacy to the scheme.Scammers’ goals are diverse – from stealing financial information and personal data to tricking victims into making payments or downloading malware.The only way to safeguard from such scam calls is to recognise the red flags of fraud calls. These may include unsolicited offers, high-pressure tactics and requests for personal information. Users should talk to the concerned person before believing such scams.","Malti Verma, a government school teacher in Agra, died due to cardiac arrest.

Bill Gates did see his ranking fall

Microsoft founder Bill Gates is no longer among America's 10 richest people. Once a perennial fixture at the top of wealth rankings, Bill Gates has seen his net worth slip significantly. The billionaire philanthropist's ranking on the 2023 list of America's wealthiest individuals has dropped to No. 9, marking a significant decline from his previous position of No.6. For stats -- nearly 20 years, beginning in 1990, Bill Gates consistently ranked as either the richest or second-richest individual on the list of America’s wealthiest people.A major factor contributing to this drop is his 2021 divorce from Melinda French Gates. The divorce settlement, estimated to be worth nearly triple the initial figure, has significantly impacted Gates' net worth. Melinda French Gates , who has received a substantial portion of the settlement, is now among the richest women in the United States.The estimate of the divorce settlement is nearly tripling the initial figure. Based on new information about Bill Gates’ current fortune, Melinda French Gates’ net worth is now estimated at $29 billion, up from $10.3 billion a year ago. This makes her the ninth-richest woman in the US.While Gates' net worth has decreased, he remains committed to philanthropic endeavors. His foundation, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation , continues to focus on global health and development, though questions have arisen about its future direction without Melinda's leadership.In media interactions, Gates has acknowledged that his wealth ranking would likely decline over time. Gates also reportedly said that there is possibility that he and Melinda might not continue working together but affirmed that the Gates Foundation is set to operate for another 25 years.Melinda French Gates, with her new foundation, Pivotal Ventures, is concentrating on empowering women and families.","Microsoft founder Bill Gates is no longer among America's 10 richest people.

Not an outright ban, so far

Strategic goals behind the Chinese government 'request'

Self-Sufficiency:

Prepare for Future Restrictions:

Nvidia's Big dilemma

China's AI Ambitions

China is reportedly ramping up efforts to boost its domestic artificial intelligence (AI) chip industry and lessen reliance on US companies like Nvidia. This move comes amidst ongoing tensions with the US and potential future sanctions. According to a report in Bloomberg, ""Beijing is stepping up pressure on Chinese companies to buy locally produced artificial intelligence chips instead of Nvidia Corp.products, part of the nation’s effort to expand its semiconductor industry and counter US sanctions .""The US government banned Nvidia from selling its most advanced AI processors to Chinese customers in 2022. Nvidia, based in Santa Clara, California, modified subsequent versions of the chips so that they could be sold under US Commerce Department regulations. The H20 line fits that criteria.Instead of an outright ban, Chinese regulators are using ""window guidance"" - unofficial but strong encouragement - to persuade companies to switch from Nvidia's H20 chips, crucial for AI development, to homegrown alternatives like those from Cambricon and Huawei. ""In recent months, several Chinese regulators, including the powerful Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, issued so-called window guidance — instructions without the force of law — to reduce the use of Nvidia,"" said the Bloomberg report quoting sources.This push for domestic chips aims to achieve two key goals:China wants to reduce dependence on foreign chipmakers, particularly in critical technological areas like AI.It also serves as a precaution against potential future US export controls.Balancing Act:While encouraging domestic options, China acknowledges the importance of building top-notch AI systems. If that requires continued use of some foreign semiconductors, it seems Beijing will still tolerate it.Caught between US regulations and a lucrative Chinese market, Nvidia is navigating a tricky situation. The company's CEO emphasizes compliance with US restrictions while striving to serve its Chinese customers.Despite US restrictions, China's AI industry continues to flourish. Major tech companies like ByteDance and Alibaba are making significant investments, alongside a wave of promising AI startups.While China boasts a booming AI sector, its homegrown AI chipmakers have yet to catch up to Nvidia's advanced technology. However, significant government subsidies are fueling efforts to bridge this gap.There are also reports about some Chinese companies that while some heed the government's call, others are said to be stockpiling Nvidia chips in anticipation of further US sanctions. This highlights the complex nature of the situation.","China is reportedly ramping up efforts to boost its domestic artificial intelligence (AI) chip industry.

Sun and Xue sentenced to prison

Two Chinese nationals Haotian Sun and Pengfei Xue were sentenced to jail in a scheme to defraud Apple out of 6,000 iPhones worth over $2.5 million. The US Department of Justice (DoJ) in a press release said that the duo will spend more than four years in prison. The sentences were announced U.S. Attorney Matthew M. Graves, Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Nicole M.Argentieri of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, Inspector in Charge Damon E. Wood of the United States Postal Inspection Service (USPIS) Washington Division, and Special Agent in Charge Derek W. Gordon of Homeland Security Investigations Washington Field Office.According to the government’s evidence, between May 2017 and September 2019, Sun, Xue, and other conspirators defrauded Apple by submitting counterfeit iPhones for repair to get the company to exchange them with genuine replacement iPhones. In a press release, DoJ said that Sun and Xue received shipments of inauthentic iPhones from Hong Kong at UPS mailboxes throughout the D.C. metropolitan area. They then submitted the fake iPhones , with spoofed serial numbers and/or IMEI numbers, to Apple retail stores and Apple Authorized Service Providers, including the Apple Store in Georgetown.Evidence showed that members of the conspiracy submitted more than 6,000 inauthentic phones to Apple during the conspiracy, causing an intended loss of approximately $3.8 million and an actual loss of more than $2.5 million.Haotian Sun was sentenced to 57 months in prison, three years of supervised release, and ordered to pay $1,072,200 in restitution to Apple and a forfeiture money judgment of $53,610. Pengfei Xue, on the other hand was sentenced to 54 months in prison, three years of supervised release, and ordered to pay $397,800 in restitution to Apple and a forfeiture money judgment of $19,890.Back in February this year, Sun and Xue were both found guilty of conspiracy to commit mail fraud following a five-day jury trial. Additionally, Sun was convicted of one count of mail fraud, while Xue was convicted of six counts.","Two Chinese nationals Haotian Sun and Pengfei Xue were sentenced to jail in a scheme to defraud Apple out of 6,000 iPhones worth over $2.5 million.

Several web browser developers have urged the regulators in the European Union (EU) to take action against Microsoft , alleging that the company is unfairly promoting its Edge browser on Windows at the expense of competitors.In a letter to the European Commission , Vivaldi, Waterfox, Wavebox and the Open Web Advocacy group argue that Microsoft is exploiting its dominance in the PC market to give Edge an unfair advantage, as per news agency Reuters.They point to Edge being the default browser on Windows and allege that Microsoft uses misleading pop-up messages to discourage users from switching to other browsers.These companies support a legal challenge by Opera , which argues that Edge should be subject to the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA), which aims to prevent large online platforms from abusing their market power and ensure fair competition.“It is paramount that the Commission reconsiders its position,” they said in a letter.“No platform independent browser can aspire to match Edge's unparalleled distribution advantage on Windows. Edge is, moreover, the most important gateway for consumers to download an independent browser on Windows PCs,” the group added.They claim that since Edge comes pre-installed on Windows, it gives it an advantage as it becomes the primary way for users to download other browsers. They also said that Microsoft misrepresents the features of competing browsers in its pop-up messages.In a February decision, the European Commission exempted Edge from the DMA, stating that it didn't consider it a dominant player, hence it cannot be considered as a gatekeeper.
