"Former US SEC head has an 'alarming career advice' for Morgan Stanley on Bitcoins, ETFs, and other Crypto investment",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/former-us-sec-head-has-an-alarming-career-advice-for-morgan-stanley-on-bitcoins-etfs-and-other-crypto-investment/articleshow/112390861.cms,"""This is a mammoth risk not just for Morgan Stanley’s retail investors (because the risk associated with crypto-asset investments is literally beyond measure) but this is also an extraordinary personal risk for some Morgan Stanley’s advisors themselves, who could lose their credential as Certified Financial Planners (CFPs).

""For any CFP planning to peddle crypto-assets, fail not at your peril. The CFP Board’s Enforcement Department is watching and with one phone call can find out exactly what you are up to. Do not take the get-rich-quick-bait and risk your career. Just say no,"" Stark reportedly added.

A former top US securities regulator is sounding the alarm about Morgan Stanley ’s decision to allow its financial advisors to promote cryptocurrency investments . John Reed Stark , the ex-head of the SEC ’s internet enforcement division, expressed deep concern over the potential risks this poses to both investors and the advisors themselves.Morgan Stanley is said to be allowing its 15,000 financial advisors to pitch shares of two spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to select clients, starting this week.The former SEC internet enforcement chief noted that these advisors can now recommend Blackrock’s Ishares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) to qualified investors. Cautioning on the same he said as per a report in Bitcoin.comnews:Stark highlighted that while this move could potentially open new investment avenues, Stark warned of the immense volatility and uncertainty surrounding cryptocurrencies. He emphasized that investors could face substantial losses, and advisors could jeopardize their professional credentials if they mishandle these investments.The CFP Board, the governing body for Certified Financial Planners, has recently tightened its regulations on cryptocurrency-related advice. Advisors must now exercise extreme caution and possess a deep understanding of the crypto market to recommend such investments. Stark stressed that the CFP Board is closely monitoring the industry and will not hesitate to take action against advisors who fail to meet these standards.","Morgan Stanley is said to be allowing its 15,000 financial advisors to pitch shares of two spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to select clients.

Watch: Google DeepMind’s robot playing table tennis,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/watch-google-deepminds-robot-playing-table-tennis/articleshow/112385028.cms,"Google DeepMind researchers have created a robot capable of playing table tennis at a solid amateur level, marking a significant advancement in robotics and artificial intelligence . The robot, featuring a 6 DoF ABB 1100 arm mounted on linear gantries, won 45% of its matches against human players of varying skill levels.In tests involving 29 participants, the robot won all matches against beginners and 55% against intermediate players.However, it struggled against advanced players, losing all matches at this level. Despite its limitations, 26 out of 29 participants expressed interest in playing with the robot again, finding the experience engaging and enjoyable.The robot's design uses a hierarchical and modular policy architecture, combining low-level controllers for specific skills with a high-level controller for strategic decision-making. It employs advanced techniques to bridge the simulation-to-real-world gap, enabling adaptation to unseen opponents and improving its decision-making process.The system's training involved a combination of reinforcement learning and imitation learning in simulation before real-world deployment. Its adaptability is enhanced by real-time tracking of match statistics and opponent performance.Despite its success, the robot faces challenges in handling fast balls, attributed to system latency, mandatory resets between shots, and insufficient data. Researchers propose investigating advanced control algorithms and hardware optimizations to address these issues.","Google DeepMind researchers have created a robot capable of playing table tennis at a solid amateur level.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Shaktikanta Das has advised banks and financial institutions to strengthen their IT systems and disaster recovery plans. His advice comes after a major outage affecting Microsoft Windows systems, caused by a faulty CrowdStrike update , highlighting the potential for widespread chaos due to even minor technical glitches.“Recently there was an unprecedented IT outage globally, which affected businesses in many countries. The outage demonstrated how a minor technical change, if it goes haywire, can wreak havoc on a global scale,” the governor said in a statement after the 50th meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC).Das emphasised the need for financial institutions to be prepared for such disruptions and to minimise their impact on customers. The RBI's directive comes in response to the growing reliance on technology in the banking sector and the increasing frequency of cyberattacks.“It [the outage] also showed the fast-growing dependence on big-techs and third-party technology solution providers. In this background, it is necessary that banks and financial institutions build appropriate risk management frameworks in their IT, Cyber security and third-party outsourcing arrangements to maintain operational resilience,” Das highlighted.By bolstering their IT infrastructure and implementing robust business continuity plans, banks can better protect themselves against potential threats and ensure uninterrupted services to customers, he noted.Last month, a widespread outage impacted Microsoft services worldwide. It was revealed that about 18 million devices were hit by the disruption and people saw ‘Blue Screen of Death (BSOD)’ on their PCs. It was later revealed that the outage was caused by a software glitch in CrowdStrike's Falcon sensor.The cybersecurity firm’s update introduced errors that led to system crashes, disrupting businesses, air travel, healthcare and countless other operations reliant on Microsoft services. The issue has since been resolved.","RBI governor Shaktikanta Das has advised banks and financial institutions to strengthen their IT systems and disaster recovery plans.

Strict crackdown on spam calls duping people across

In a decisive move to combat the menace of spam calls, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India ( TRAI ) has announced stringent measures against entities misusing bulk connections. Effective immediately, telecom operators -- Reliance Jio, Airtel, Vodafone-Idea and BSNL -- will be required to disconnect the services of any entity found to be making spam calls through PRI or SIP connections.These entities will also be blacklisted by all operators for a period of up to two years.TRAI has emphasized the urgent need to address the issue of spam calls, which has been a persistent annoyance for consumers. The regulator held a meeting with telecom service providers to discuss the matter and finalize these stringent measures.""This information shall be shared by the TSP with all other TSPs who will, in turn, disconnect all the telecom resources given by them to that entity and blacklist it for a period of up to two years.

Apple modifies App Store policy in EU: Here’s what is changing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-modifies-app-store-policy-in-eu-heres-what-is-changing/articleshow/112383731.cms,"Changes coming to Apple App Store policies

Other tech giants in EU crosshair

Apple has announced changes to its App Store after the European Union (EU) accused the iPhone maker of violating its Digital Markets Act ( DMA ) by unfairly restricting app developers from informing users about cheaper purchasing options outside the App Store.The European Commission , the EU's antitrust regulator, previously said that Apple allows steering only through “link-outs”.This means that app developers can include a link in their app that redirects the customer to a web page where the customer can conclude a contract.“Our preliminary position is that Apple does not fully allow steering. Steering is key to ensure that app developers are less dependent on gatekeepers' app stores and for consumers to be aware of better offers,” said Margrethe Vestager , Executive Vice-President of the European Commission.Apple said that there will be changes to comply with the DMA to address the findings of the Commission and in response to the announcements made in June, as per news agency Reuters.Starting later this year, Apple said that developers in the EU “can communicate and promote offers for purchases” wherever they want, such as via an alternative app marketplace – essentially avoiding large penalties in the region.Apple also said that the changes mean developers will have a new fee structure. There will be two new fees: an initial 5% acquisition fee for new users and a 10% store services fee for any sales made by app users on any platform within the 12 months of the app installation.In the current scenarios, Apple charges three types of fees: a core technology fee for the less than 1% of apps, a reduced commission for all digital goods and services sold through the App Store, and an optional fee for the payments and commerce services.Apple is not the only company targeted by the DMA. Google parent Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft and TikTok owner ByteDance are also under the Commission’s lens. Online travel giant Booking.com as well as Elon Musk's X are also being told to comply with the rules.","Apple announced changes to its App Store after the European Union (EU) accused the iPhone maker of violating its Digital Markets Act.

"Reliance Jio, Airtel and Vodafone-Idea 'unhappy' with Trai's new QoS rules; say overlook ground realities",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/reliance-jio-airtel-and-vodafone-idea-unhappy-with-trais-new-qos-rules-say-overlook-ground-realities/articleshow/112268723.cms,"COAI statement

COAI’s member Telecom Service Providers (TSPs) have consistently invested in enhancing Quality of Service (QoS) through significant improvements in network infrastructure, resulting in greater stability and reliability. The industry has embraced advanced technologies and automation tools, including predictive maintenance and AI-driven analytics, to proactively address network issues. Moreover, major initiatives are underway to fiberize towers across India, which is a crucial step for the efficient deployment of 5G services.

While TRAI has tightened the QoS benchmarks over the years, the ground realities remain unchanged. TSPs still grapple with Right of Way (RoW) issues when acquiring permissions for infrastructure deployment in public and private land for the installation of cell towers and fiber-optic cables. The situation is further aggravated due to additional requirement of street furniture for the 5G networks. Moreover, interference from various sources, such as other wireless devices and electromagnetic interference, degrade signal quality and network performance. Further, illegal boosters and repeaters used by unauthorised agents, as well as the cases of theft of equipment are also external factors which, nevertheless, impact the QoS. Besides, frequent takedown of the overhead fiber by the authorities have a significant impact in QoS as well. TSPs have limited control over these external sources which adversely impact the Quality of Services.

Despite these challenges, TSPs have consistently met TRAI's QoS benchmarks. The industry expresses concern over the proposed regulations, which not only tighten benchmarks but also shift from quarterly to monthly reporting and site to cell level reporting in many cases. In fact, the QoS parameters prescribed in the new Regulations have not been introduced by any other regulator in other similar economies. These changes are expected to significantly increase the compliance as well as the cost burden on telecom operators, and without commensurate benefits for the customers.

While we are disappointed with the stringency of these new regulations, we remain committed to engaging constructively with TRAI on QoS-related matters. Our member organizations will continue to strive for excellence in service quality while advocating for regulations that recognize the practical challenges faced by our industry.

What are the new QoS rules

The telecom industry has raised concerns over stringent new quality of service (QoS) norms introduced by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India ( TRAI ). The Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), representing major telecom players -- Reliance Jio , Airtel and Vodafone-Idea -- argues that the regulations impose excessive burdens without addressing the challenges operators face on the ground.The new rules mandate stricter service quality benchmarks, increased penalties for non-compliance, and more frequent reporting requirements. Telecom operators must now compensate subscribers for outages exceeding 24 hours at the district level and face penalties of up to Rs 10 lakh for violations.However, COAI contends that these measures are impractical given ongoing hurdles such as right-of-way (RoW) issues for infrastructure deployment, interference from unauthorized devices, and theft of equipment. The industry body also highlights the impact of frequent fiber cuts and the additional demands of 5G network rollout. Despite these challenges, telecom operators have consistently met Trai's QoS benchmarks , according to COAI. The industry is seeking a more realistic approach that acknowledges the operational difficulties and avoids placing undue financial pressure on operators.Trai has issued new quality of service (QoS) rules, making it mandatory for telecom operators to compensate subscribers in case of service outages for more than 24 hours at a district level. Trai has also increased the penal amount to Rs 1 lakh from Rs 50,000 for failing to meet each quality benchmark under the new rules.The telecom regulator has introduced a graded penalty system of Rs 1 lakh, Rs 2 lakh, Rs 5 lakh and Rs 10 lakh for different scales of rule violations and submitting false report under revised regulations -- ""The Standards of Quality of Service of Access (Wirelines and Wireless) and Broadband (Wireline and Wireless) Service Regulations, 2024"".Trai has provided a six-month grace period for operators to align their systems with the new regulations.","The Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), representing major telecom players -- Reliance Jio, Airtel and Vodafone-Idea -- argues that the regulations impose excessive burdens.

How to identify Amazon OTP scam

Meanwhile, if you are a victim of cybercrime, register your complaint with the National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal at https://cybercrime.gov.in/ or call 1930.

Amazon Great Freedom Festival sale is here and as shoppers flock to the e-commerce platform for shopping, scammers are also gearing up to capitalise on the increased online activity. One common tactic employed by fraudsters is the OTP scam. Numerous individuals have fallen victim to this scheme in the past, prompting Amazon to issue warnings to its customers.Since people usually spend thousands of their hard-earned money, it becomes crucial to remain vigilant and protect personal information during this sale period, especially from scammers requesting sign-in OTP via phone calls.In a communication shared with customers recently, Amazon said that scammers are adopting multiple tactics to defraud unsuspecting shoppers. A growing number of individuals have reported receiving phone calls from individuals posing as Amazon customer service representatives or delivery agents. These scammers aim to steal personal information, including login credentials, by manipulating victims into revealing sensitive data.Scammers often try to create a sense of urgency, stating that there has been an unexpected order or delivery which may not have been placed by a potential victim. The scammers will then ask for a sign-in One-Time Password (OTP) to cancel the delivery.A confused ‘customer’ then shares the OTP thinking that he/ she has averted the hassle of package delivery, however in reality, the scammer has gained access to the account. Shoppers must note that Amazon will never ask its customers to share their account sign-in OTP or passcode, especially over the phone to avoid being scammed.“If you receive communication — a call, text, or email — that you think may not be from Amazon, please report it to us at, amazon.in/reportascam,” it said.Last year, Amazon India and the Uttar Pradesh Police joined hands to fight fraud and protect online shoppers from bad actors. They launched a consumer education and awareness campaign named #MissionGraHAQ.","Amazon Great Freedom Festival sale is here and as shoppers flock to the e-commerce platform for shopping, scammers are gearing up to capitalise on the increased online activity.

Delta Airlines seeks compensation for disruption

In mounting problems for CrowdStrike over Microsoft outage last month, the cybersecurity company being sued by air travellers in a latest move. According to a Reuters report, air travellers whose flights were delayed or cancelled on July 19 due to Microsoft Windows outage on July 19 have filed a class action against the company.The plaintiffs include three fliers who filed the lawsuit in the federal court, Austin, Texas.They blame CrowdStrike's negligence in testing and deploying its software for the outage. Adding further, they stated that as fliers scrambled to get to their destinations, many spent hundreds of dollars on lodging, meals and alternative travel, while others missed work or suffered health problems from having to sleep on the airport floor.The filers demand CrowdStrike to pay compensatory and punitive damages to anyone whose flight was disrupted.In a statement, CrowdStrike said ""We believe this case lacks merit and we will vigorously defend the company."" The US cybersecurity company also provided an identical statement in response to a shareholder lawsuit filed on July 31.Delta claims that it faced over 2,200 flight cancellations on July 19 alone, with more than 6,000 flights cancelled since then. The airline is now dealing with over 176,000 refund or reimbursement requests. The estimated cost of the outages could reach as high as $500 million.The company’s CEO Ed Bastian said last week the outage had cost the airline $500 million, adding that it plans to take legal action to get compensation from the cybersecurity firm.Microsoft outage on July 19 was caused by a faulty software update that impacted 8 million Windows computers worldwide.

This marks the first time the DGGI has issued such a notice to a cryptocurrency firm, setting a significant precedent in India’s efforts to regulate the rapidly growing virtual currency market.Sources confirmed that the notice was issued to Binance for collecting fees from Indian customers trading in virtual digital assets (VDAs) on their platform, categorized under online information database access or retrieval (OIDAR) services.Earlier this year, Binance received approval from India’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) to register as a virtual asset service provider (VASP). However, the company was slapped with a Rs 18 crore penalty from the FIU last month for non-compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) regulations.Despite being a major player in the global cryptocurrency market, with at least 40% market share and operations across more than 150 countries, Binance had not registered under the Indian GST framework. This oversight has now brought the company under the scrutiny of Indian tax authorities.“Binance reportedly earned at least Rs 4,000 crore from transaction fees charged to Indian customers. The company has a user base of 90 million users globally, including a substantial number of customers from India too. Detailed investigation revealed that the earnings of these fees were credited to the account of a Binance Group Company — Nest Services Limited — based in Seychelles,” a top source privy to the development said.In fact, Binance is reportedly facing a trial in a Nigerian court for alleged tax evasion, following a crypto crackdown in the country.To make Binance compliant with the GST regulations, DGGI Ahmedabad zonal unit also sent emails to Binance group companies in Seychelles, the Cayman Islands and Switzerland, which did not elicit a response. Binance appointed a local counsel in India to liaise with the DGGI, marking the first step towards resolving this significant tax compliance issue.Sources confirmed that DGGI is also closely monitoring financial transactions and activities of online gaming platforms and marketplaces for the possibility of tax evasion.The Indian GST regime mandates that foreign service providers pay GST for services provided to Indian residents, particularly under the OIDAR category. As the investigation continues, other cryptocurrency exchanges operating both overseas and within India are also expected to face scrutiny from tax authorities, said sources.","The Ahmedabad zonal unit of the Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGGI) has issued a show cause notice to Binance.

The new offering promises lightning-fast 8-16 minute deliveries for a diverse range of products, spanning from groceries to electronics.With this move, Flipkart directly challenges established players in the booming quick commerce sector, including Swiggy's Instamart, Zomato's Blinkit , Zepto , and BigBasket's BB Now.The service, which was previously offered on a trial basis to employees at Flipkart's headquarters, is now available to users through the Flipkart app.We confirmed the service's availability by checking an address in HSR on the Flipkart app, which indeed showed Flipkart Minutes as an option for quick delivery. Additionally, several users on X (formerly Twitter) reported that Flipkart is delivering groceries and other items to their addresses in Bengaluru within minutes through the ""Minutes"" service.Sources familiar with the matter tell the Economic Times that Flipkart plans to expand the service to more areas in Bengaluru over the next few weeks.The launch of Flipkart Minutes comes at a time when other players in the quick commerce space are aggressively expanding their operations.The ET had earlier reported that Flipkart was planning to operate around 100 dark stores to bolster its quick-commerce offerings during the upcoming festive season. Dark stores, which are mini warehouses strategically located for rapid deliveries, have become a crucial component of quick commerce operations.Blinkit, for instance, recently announced ambitious plans to increase its dark store count to 2,000 by 2026. This doubles down on its earlier announced plans to have 1,000 dark stores by March 2025. Similarly, Zepto aims to double its network to 700 dark stores by March 2025. Swiggy Instamart , another major player, currently operates more than 500 such warehouses.Interestingly, Amazon, a key player in the e-commerce space, has not shown interest in the quick-commerce business in India so far. However, it does operate a grocery store service dubbed "" Amazon Fresh ,"" offering same-day delivery for groceries.

What doctor said

An Apple Watch user is crediting the smartwatch for saving his life after the wearable alerted him about a life-threatening condition. Peter Moore , a resident of Montecito, California shared his experience with a local news publisher KTLA. Narrating the incident, he said “I wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for this little device”.Moore, who is a former tech executive, said that he was on his way to the airport when he began to feel “a little lightheaded and a little faint”.“Like a typical male, I thought, ‘I’ll go to Starbucks. That’ll fix it,'” Moore explained before he received a notification from the Apple Watch he was wearing.“My phone started to ping and said ‘low heart rate,’ which I’d never seen before. And so I looked at it… my heart rate had dropped to 32. And it was insistent in its notifications that something wasn’t right,” said Moore. He then contacted his wife who took him to hospital.“The doctor kind of theatrically ran in and said, ‘This is not good. This is not good. You need a pacemaker right now,'” Moore said.Omid Yousefian, the cardiac electrophysiologist at Sansum Clinic Cardiology who treated Moore said “Yes, his watch had a big role in saving his life”.“These days, 25% of the population over the age of 40 … have a high chance of experiencing atrial fibrillation,” Yousefian explained.“For us physicians, symptoms are the most important thing. [Moore] was notified by his watch that his heart rate is slow and he correlated that with the symptoms that he had. So he didn’t wait. He didn’t sit. He came to the hospital directly. So he made a very smart move,” Yousefian told the publication.","Peter Moore, a former tech executive, was on his way to the airport when he began to feel “a little lightheaded and a little faint” He received a notification from the Apple Watch he was wearing that his heart rate had dropped to 32.

What exactly happened

Read the complete post here

In a shocking incident, a Supreme Court lawyer, Mukul P Unny , was scammed out of Rs 38,000 while attempting to exchange his iPhone 13 for an iPhone 15 on Amazon .in. The lawyer detailed his ordeal on social media, highlighting the fraudulent tactics employed by the delivery executive.Unny took X (formerly known as Twitter) to post about the new kind of smartphone exchange scam.The incident occurred on July 21, 2024, when Unny placed an order for the iPhone 15 on Amazon. The following day, a delivery executive arrived at his residence and handed over the new phone after receiving the necessary OTP. However, the executive then requested another OTP, claiming it was required to complete the exchange.Despite Unny's hesitation, he was convinced to return the new iPhone to the delivery executive after speaking to the latter's supervisor.Unny contacted Amazon customer care the following day to report the incident. Initially, Amazon assured him of a refund if the product was not delivered. However, subsequent inquiries revealed the case was under investigation with a resolution deadline of July 31.On July 31st, Amazon concluded its investigation and informed Unny that a refund was impossible. The company's explanation lacked substance, as they had not thoroughly verified the scam details. The fact that Unny still possessed his old iPhone directly contradicted Amazon's claim that the exchange was complete.While Amazon has eventually issued a refund to Unny, his ordeal underscores the considerable risks inherent in online transactions, even when dealing with reputable platforms like Amazon.Always verify the identity of a delivery executive before sharing your Amazon OTP. This crucial step can protect you from falling victim to scams.“This is the story of my worst experience with @amazonIN On 21.07.2024, I ordered iPhone 15 from Amazon in exchange for my iPhone 13. On 22.07.2024, the delivery executive came at around 930 PM. I gave the OTP and took the product, and gave my phone to the executive.He said I have give another OTP. I had already given the OTP and was wondering what other OTP is to be given for exchange. I said I dont have any other OTP than the one I have given. He stayed there for few minutes & then called his supervisor.After speaking with the supervisor, the delivery exec asked for return of the product since the ""exchange is not final"".I insisted that I speak with the supervisor. The supervisor tells me that the exchange is done by a different team & requests for the product to be returned. I said I cannot give away the product especially since the OTP is given and the app was showing that the product is delivered. But this supervisor Ashok (8076650306) requested me to return, lest his team will have to make for the loss.Upon his request and assurance that the product will be ""reattempted"" the next day, I gave the product to the delivery exec (Vishal 8826421956) after taking the supervisor's and the delivery exec's number. On 23.07.2024, I spoke with the Amazon Customer Care and raised a complaint to which I assured that refund will be initiated if the product is not delivered. Call centre asked me to follow up on 25.07.2024.On 26.07.2024,when I called them, the customer case asked me to wait till 31.05.2024 as ""it has to be investigated"". Today, when I call Amazon, they said ""investigation"" is complete and that refund cannot be initiated. No fact-finding was done by Amazon in this. Now, we are staring at a loss of Rs. 38000 and a possible scam done by supervisor, delivery exec and others at Amazon. If they say that the exchange is done, then they can very well see the old phone that I still use with me.This could happen to any one of you and please be aware while dealing with @amazonIN.”","Supreme Court lawyer Mukul P Unny was scammed out of Rs 38,000 while attempting to exchange his iPhone 13 for an iPhone 15 on Amazon.in.
