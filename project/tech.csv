Search within Recents in the Phone app or use Spotlight Search to quickly surface information.

Live caller ID lookup New APIs allow developers like Truecaller to fetch information from their servers and provide live caller ID for incoming calls, in a privacy-preserving way.”

Truecaller on iPhones has been there for a while. However, it is not as seamless as on Android. One of the app’s key features - caller ID - is not available on iPhones due to privacy issues. But this is set to end soon with the iOS 18 rollout.Truecaller CEO Alan Mamedi in a post on X (formerly Twitter) said “From the iOS 18 feature release documentation :) Soon we will hopefully hear people say ‘Truecaller finally works on iPhone ’.Even though it has worked fairly OK in the last 2 years, this time it will be just like you would expect Truecaller to work, end to end.”The post also shared screenshots of release documentations of iOS 18 which reads:Truecaller has long been criticized for privacy. In 2022, an investigation conducted by The Caravan alleged that Truecaller gathered information without the user's consent. Truecaller, on its part, denied the allegations, saying that the investigation was flawed and based on incorrect data.","Truecaller on iPhones has been there for a while.

Availability of OpenAI o1 series

Sam Altman-led OpenAI has launched a new series of reasoning models under the o1 series . The company says that these new models can reason through complex tasks and solve harder problems than previous models in science, coding, and math.OpenAI o1 and OpenAI o1-mini , the company said, are trained to spend more time thinking through problems before they respond, much like a person would.OpenAI further claims that the o1 series models perform “similarly to PhD students on challenging benchmark tasks in physics, chemistry, and biology. We also found that it excels in math and coding.”“In a qualifying exam for the International Mathematics Olympiad (IMO), GPT-4o correctly solved only 13% of problems, while the reasoning model scored 83%,” it added.OpenAI says that the o1 model can be used by healthcare researchers to annotate cell sequencing data, by physicists to generate complicated mathematical formulas needed for quantum optics, and by developers in all fields to build and execute multi-step workflows.The company has also announced OpenAI o1-mini – a faster, cheaper reasoning model, particularly for coding.“As a smaller model, o1-mini is 80% cheaper than o1-preview, making it a powerful, cost-effective model for applications that require reasoning but not broad world knowledge,” the company stated.The company says that OpenAI o1 series will be available for ChatGPT Plus and Team users. They are rolling out to end users. Both o1-preview and o1-mini can be selected manually in the model picker. The models have a weekly rate limit of 30 messages for o1-preview and 50 for o1-mini.“We are working to increase those rates and enable ChatGPT to automatically choose the right model for a given prompt,” the company added.","OpenAI has launched a new series of reasoning models under the o1 series.

Pavel Durov, CEO of Telegram , has recently become the subject of widespread speculation after older photos of him resurfaced online. These images have led many to wonder whether the billionaire entrepreneur underwent plastic surgery to enhance his appearance. Adding to the intrigue, Durov was recently arrested in France, raising further questions about the man behind the popular messaging app.Pavel Durov, a 39-year-old entrepreneur originally from Russia, is best known as the founder and CEO of Telegram, a messaging app launched in 2013.Telegram quickly gained popularity for its strong emphasis on user privacy, offering end-to-end encryption and other security features that set it apart from competitors. As of now, Forbes estimates Durov's net worth to be around $15.5 billion. Despite his success in the tech industry, Durov has managed to maintain a relatively low profile—until now.Durov's recent arrest in Paris has added a new layer of complexity to his public image. He was detained in France on charges of suspected complicity in running an online platform involved in illicit activities, including child exploitation, drug trafficking, and fraud. While these allegations are serious, it is the sudden focus on Durov's physical transformation that has captured the internet's attention.Pavel Durov has been active on social media platforms like Instagram since 2011, regularly sharing photos from his travels around the world. In his recent posts, Durov appears with a full head of hair and a toned physique, often posing shirtless in various locations. However, these recent images stand in stark contrast to older photos where Durov was seen with a noticeably receding hairline.The drastic change in his appearance has fueled rumours that Durov may have undergone plastic surgery, including a possible hair transplant. A popular post on X (formerly Twitter) by a well-known account shared a side-by-side comparison of Durov's old and new photos, sparking a flurry of online discussions. The post reads, ""Pavel Durov (Telegram CEO) before his hair transplant and plastic surgery,"" and has since gone viral.The speculation around Durov's transformation has been met with a variety of opinions online. On Reddit, users have debated whether the changes in Durov's appearance are the result of surgical procedures or simply better grooming and styling.One Reddit user commented, ""This isn't a hair transplant. His hair is too thick and full to have this kind of drastic change from a HT. Most likely he's wearing a hair system (wig).""Another user added, ""There's speculation that it's not a transplant, but rather a hair system because his hair loss was much more advanced in the first picture, so when the operation happens, the resulting hairdo never looks as full as his.""Some users believe the changes are the result of plastic surgery, with one theorising, ""This is well-done surgery.""However, not everyone is convinced that surgery is involved. One Reddit user opined, ""Honestly, I think a lot of the facial 'changes' are simply due to the much better angle and lighting in the second photo.""As the speculation continues, it's clear that Durov's transformation—whether natural or assisted—has caught the public's eye. The intense scrutiny of his appearance highlights the challenges that come with being in the spotlight, especially for someone as private as Durov. Whether or not he has undergone any procedures, the discussions around his looks reflect a broader societal fascination with image and success.","Pavel Durov, 39, is the founder and CEO of Telegram, a messaging app launched in 2013.

Elon Musk praised Ratan Tata

The legacy of the Tata Nano

Also read

In the realm of business and innovation, few figures command as much respect as Tata Group chairman emeritus Ratan Tata. His influence extends far beyond the Indian corporate world, even garnering admiration from Tesla CEO and X owner Elon Musk . In a 2009 interview with American journalist Charlie Rose , Musk praised Ratan Tata as a ""gentleman and a scholar."" This moment has recently resurfaced, shedding light on Musk's appreciation for Ratan Tata and his ambitious project, the Tata Nano .The Tata Nano was introduced by Tata Motors in 2008 as the world's cheapest car, with a price tag of just Rs 1 lakh (approximately $2,300 at the time). The car was a pet project of Ratan Tata, designed to make automobile ownership accessible to millions of Indians who had never been able to afford a car. The idea was revolutionary—a small, affordable car that would cater to the vast Indian middle class, providing them with a safe and efficient means of transportation.In the interview with Charlie Rose, which took place shortly after the launch of the Tata Nano, the Tesla CEO was asked about his views on Ratan Tata’s efforts to introduce a low-cost car in India. The interview clip, which has recently gone viral, captures Musk's candid response.""Take for a moment Ratan Tata, what he’s doing in India — developing a little sedan for $2300. Where do you put that in the whole equation of where the future of cars is?"" asked Rose.Musk responded with a mix of admiration and caution. He began by acknowledging the brilliance behind the Tata Nano project and the character of Ratan Tata himself.""I think it's a good idea to have affordable cars, but I think the problem with something like the Nano ... I wouldn't say problem because I think, by the way, it is probably a great idea and Ratan is a gentleman and scholar,"" Musk said.However, Musk also expressed his concerns about the long-term viability of such a low-cost vehicle, particularly in the context of rising fuel prices. He pointed out that while the initial purchase cost of the Nano was remarkably low, the cost of running the car—particularly fuel costs—could become a significant issue as gasoline prices continued to rise.""But where it’s going to become challenging in the future is when the price of gasoline rises, the cost of acquiring the car is much less of an issue than the cost of running the car,"" the billionnaire explained.Despite the initial excitement surrounding the Tata Nano, the car faced numerous challenges. One of the most significant issues was its branding. While the Nano was intended to be an affordable vehicle for the masses, it was often labeled as ""cheap"" rather than ""affordable."" This perception problem, combined with safety concerns and competition from other small cars, led to unimpressive sales figures.The Nano’s production was ultimately discontinued in 2018, marking the end of what was initially seen as a groundbreaking project. The car's journey from inception to discontinuation is often cited as one of the biggest marketing failures in the automobile industry.","The Tata Nano was introduced by Tata Motors in 2008 as the world's cheapest car, with a price tag of just Rs 1 lakh (approximately $2,300 at the time) The car was a pet project of Ratan Tata, designed to make automobile ownership accessible to millions of Indians who had never been able to afford a car.

New CEO Tim Harvey's email to employees after old CEO refused to step down

OneWeb's official statement

Israeli software company OpenWeb reportedly finds itself in a leadership crisis as founder-CEO Nadav Shoval publicly disputes the board's decision to appoint Tim Harvey as the new CEO. According to a report in CTech, the drama unfolded this week when Harvey, previously the chairman of the board, announced he would take over the CEO role from Shoval at a company-wide Townhall.Shoval, however, claims this move violates his contract and undermines the company.For those unaware, founded in 2012 as Spot.IM, OpenWeb provides an online platform that facilitates healthy discussions for publishers and their communities. The startup boasts of over 100 million active users, the company has secured significant funding, including a $170 million Series F round in October 2022, valuing OpenWeb at $1.5 billion.In an email to employees, Shoval accused the board of ""falsely stating"" his departure and ""acting against OpenWeb's best interests."" He further claims to have notified the board about contractual breaches, but they proceeded with the leadership change anyway. “I will continue relentlessly fighting for OpenWeb's mission and purpose. I notified the Board that they breached my contract, which was intended to directly call out their concerning conduct. Instead of addressing these issues, the Board decided to move forward with an attempted leadership transition, continuing to act against OpenWeb's best interests,” he wrote.Shoval’s letter followed an earlier email sent to employees announcing Harvey’s appointment as CEO. “I will be stepping in as our new CEO, succeeding Nadav Shoval, who has led the company with incredible passion and vision since its inception,” wrote Harvey, before going on to thank Shoval for all his contributions.Harvey, in a separate message to staff, acknowledged the confusion and apologized for the situation. He emphasized a ""planned CEO transition process"" and vowed to handle it with ""respect"" for all parties. Harvey wrote to the staff: ""Apologies to everyone who received this email. We are progressing with the CEO transition process as planned. As we move forward, we are committed to handling this situation with the utmost respect for all individuals involved and acknowledging their contributions to OpenWeb. Our priority remains the continued success, stability and providing value to our partners.""OpenWeb's official statement acknowledges Shoval's founding role and ""incredible passion"" while welcoming Harvey as the ""interim CEO."" They highlight Harvey's extensive experience and aim to maintain the company's growth trajectory. The statement concludes by emphasizing OpenWeb's commitment to ""trusted spaces for meaningful dialogue"" and its talented team.","Israeli software company OpenWeb reportedly finds itself in a leadership crisis.

Here are some tips to protect yourself from such scams

Telecom operator Reliance Jio has issued a warning for its customers. The service provider is asking the customers to beware of the calls and messages coming from +92 code.“Beware of calls/messages from +92 code or other sources impersonating as police officials. Dial 1930 or report in cybercrime.gov.in to lodge cybercrime complaint,” the company said in an SMS sent to its users.Scammers often pose as police officers to trick people into revealing personal information or sending money.Recently, CBI also issued a warning to the public about a surge in fraudulent activities where scammers are impersonating CBI officers to extort money. These criminals are using the agency’s logo and the names of senior officials to create a sense of authenticity and deceive unsuspecting victims.* If you receive a call from someone claiming to be a police officer, ask for their badge number, department name, and contact information. You can then verify this information through official channels.* Avoid sharing sensitive details like your Social Security number, bank account information, or credit card details over the phone, especially if you didn't initiate the call.* Real police officers will never pressure you to make immediate payments or decisions. If someone is demanding immediate action, it's a red flag.* If you're unsure about a call, hang up and contact the police department directly using a number you know is legitimate.",Telecom operator Reliance Jio has issued a warning for its customers.

Spam and phishing message menace grows in India

What the government’s directive says

Bharti Airtel CEO Gopal Vittal has written a letter to the heads of Reliance Jio , Vodafone Idea , state-run Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd ( BSNL ) and Tata Teleservices, says a report in Economic Times. In the letter, Vittal proposed creating a collaborative system for sharing information about corporate connections used for commercial calling. This collaborative approach is aimed to monitor and prevent the misuse of these connections.""We are ready to take the first step and share the data (entity name and active numbers only) in the same template on a monthly basis and we would appreciate your support,"" Vittal said in the letter.The letter was sent to Reliance Jio MD Pankaj Pawar, Vodafone Idea CEO Akshaya Moondra, BSNL CMD Robert Ravi and Tata Teleservices MD Harjit Singh Chauhan.""As the telecom industry continues to face the growing challenge of UCC, it has become clear that despite ongoing efforts, more robust and unified mechanisms are required to protect our customers from this persistent issue,"" Vittal said in the letter. He also stressed that in line with the directives of Trai and DoT, the focus remains on finding effective solutions to curb UCC. UCC in the telecom industry means Unsolicited Commercial Communications that describes the combination of communications and collaboration technologies.""We strongly believe that tackling this issue should be a joint endeavour among all telecom operators, rather than isolated efforts,"" he said.Telecom operators must take ""collective responsibility"" in preventing UCC by ensuring that their networks are not exploited by spammers, especially through corporate connections that may be unintentionally facilitating such activities, he said.""Today, enterprise customers are served by multiple operators, and we are seized of the fact that any independent efforts to address spam may not be in the best interests of customers, as it may impact the quality and continuity of services,"" Vittal added.According to industry data, 1.5-1.7 billion commercial messages are sent every day in India, taking the total to about 55 billion every month. As per a survey by community social media platform Local Circles, six in 10 consumers get three or more spam calls each day, with financial services and real estate said to be top offenders. In another survey, 76% consumers said that they get three or more spam messages daily. Blocking numbers doesn't help either.The problem has proven intractable for stakeholders including telcos, the regulator and the government. Recently, the government directed telecom companies to disconnect entities using bulk connections to engage in such activity. Around 350,000 such numbers have been blocked and 50 entities have been blacklisted in the last two weeks.The telecom regulatory authority of India (TRAI) asked telcos to share information on blacklisted entities with each other, so that such entities don't switch from one operator to another.","Bharti Airtel CEO Gopal Vittal has written a letter to the heads of Reliance Jio, Vodafone Idea, state-run Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd ( BSNL ) and Tata Teleservices.

Alibaba facing regulatory pressure

Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma has urged the company to embrace competition and trust in market forces. In an internal memo marking Alibaba's 25th anniversary, Ma acknowledged the challenges facing the e-commerce giant but emphasized the importance of resilience and innovation.“Many of Alibaba’s business face challenges and the possibility of being surpassed, but that’s to be expected as no single company can stay at the top forever in any industry,” Ma said in a letter sent to employees, seen by The Wall Street Journal.Once a dominant player in China's e-commerce industry, Alibaba has faced increased competition from upstarts like Pinduoduo and Douyin . The company has also been navigating a weakening Chinese economy and subdued consumer sentiment.Ma stressed that competition is essential for growth and industry health. ""Only with competition can we become stronger,"" he said.Ma reiterated Alibaba's ambition to be a long-lasting company, emphasizing the importance of idealistic beliefs and trust in the market. He encouraged employees to remain focused amidst challenges and competition. “The reason we’re Alibaba is because we have idealistic beliefs, we trust the future, believe in the market.
