badge

Google has begun rolling out a new feature in the Play Store that makes it easier than ever to identify apps that allow you to delete your account.The new feature highlights apps with a “account deletion available"" badge on their store listing. This badge indicates that the app adheres to Google's data deletion policy, which mandates that apps allowing user account creation must also offer a clear and functional way to delete that account.Prior to this update, users often had to navigate an app's settings or search online resources to determine if account deletion was even possible. The new badge offers a straightforward solution, letting users know upfront if an app respects their right to data privacy .“Google Play’s data deletion badge give users a new set of transparency and controls over their user data while providing developers a way to showcase how they treat user data responsibly. If your app allows users to create an account from within your app, our User data policy requires that it must also allow users to request for their account to be deleted,” said the company.This feature rollout comes on the heels of Google's policy announcement from April 2023. Back then, Google mandated that all apps with user accounts have a functional account deletion option by May 31, 2024.","Google has begun rolling out a new feature in the Play Store that makes it easier than ever to identify apps that allow you to delete your account.

SEBI is banning apps that offer these virtual trading services,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/sebi-is-banning-apps-that-offer-these-virtual-trading-services/articleshow/110476097.cms,"Why the Crackdown on virtual trading gaming apps

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) is clamping down on the growing trend of virtual stock gaming apps . These apps, which have become increasingly popular due to the surge in retail investor interest, allow users to create virtual portfolios and compete based on real-time stock prices . India's stock market regulator SEBI is not too pleases with such apps. SEBI is concerned about potential risks associated with these games, particularly when they involve real-money rewards.SEBI's primary concern centers around activities that resemble "" dabba trading ,"" a banned practice where orders are placed through unauthorized channels. By restricting access to real-time data for these gaming apps, SEBI aims to prevent users from potentially developing unrealistic expectations about the stock market or engaging in risky behavior based on virtual wins.SEBI has directed stock exchanges and depositories to stop sharing real-time price data with third-party apps. This move effectively cuts off the data feed that fuels these virtual stock games. It's important to note that this action is specifically targeted at apps offering financial rewards or gamifying real-time stock movements. Educational or entertainment-focused apps utilizing historical data or delayed feeds are likely not to be impacted.What it means for gamers and developersThe future of virtual stock games in India is uncertain. Developers will likely need to adapt their apps to comply with SEBI's regulations. This could involve switching to non-real-time data or focusing on educational elements instead of competition. Users who enjoyed these games for entertainment purposes may need to find alternatives, while those seeking financial rewards will be out of luck.SEBI's crack down highlights the evolving regulatory landscape surrounding financial apps and gamification. While virtual stock games can be a way to learn about the market, SEBI is prioritizing investor protection. This crackdown might encourage developers to create more educational and responsible financial gaming experiences in the future.","The Securities and Exchange Board of India is clamping down on the growing trend of virtual stock gaming apps.

The existing iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max are offered in Black Titanium, White Titanium, Blue Titanium and Natural Titanium colours.Kuo reveals that the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus are expected to come in black, green, pink, blue and white colour variants. Apple may also rename previous colours as well, Kuo adds. For example, the existing white could be renamed to starlight. “Also, even if the colour name is the same as the existing model, it may look different”, he says.Earlier, Kuo said that the iPhone 16 Pro Max is expected to feature a new battery with better energy density, potentially enhancing battery life if Apple maintains the same battery size. According to Kuo, iPhone 16 Pro Max will reportedly see a substantial redesign of its battery, switching from an aluminium to a stainless steel casing. This shift not only increases the battery's energy density but also improves its structural integrity. While stainless steel is less effective at dissipating heat compared to aluminium, it offers stronger protection, which could be beneficial for the overall durability of the device.In a related news, display analyst Ross Young said that the display production for Apple iPhone 16 will begin next month. This is on schedule with the timing of last year’s iPhone 15 production and the 2024 iPhone series launch may follow the same timeline as last year.","Apple may add two new colours to the iPhone 16, replacing the existing ones.

Concerns and innovations in AI technology

AI's expanding role in media

In a bold move at the Cannes Film Festival, Polish director Patryk Vega unveiled his latest project, a biopic titled ""Putin,"" featuring an AI-generated deepfake of Russian President Vladimir Putin . The film, which has already been sold in 50 countries ahead of its September premiere, uses advanced artificial intelligence to replicate Putin's face on a real actor’s body.Vega, known for his popular Polish films, decided to use AI technology to create a more authentic portrayal of Putin.""To come extremely close to the dictator, we needed Putin, not an actor with make-up,"" Vega explained. The film’s trailer opens with a striking scene of the Russian leader cowering on the floor in diapers, setting the tone for its controversial narrative.As per an ET report, Vega humorously recounted his approach: ""I called Putin and asked him if he wanted to play in my movie... No, that was a joke."" Despite the jest, the director utilised AI to generate Putin's face due to the lack of sufficient high-resolution images for a full-body deepfake. The results, according to early viewers, are uncannily realistic.""Putin"" chronicles the life of the Russian president over six decades, starting from his childhood at age 10, where he is depicted being beaten by his stepfather. The film culminates in a fictional portrayal of his death, which Vega describes as ""a happy end.""The concept for the biopic emerged during the early days of Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Initially, Vega aimed to make a film about the Russian mafia but shifted focus to what he considered ""the biggest gangster.""Despite potential risks, Vega dismisses fears of reprisals, boldly stating, ""Putin should be afraid of me."" The director's venture into AI has broader implications for the film industry, particularly in Hollywood, where the technology is both a boon and a source of concern. AI advancements threaten traditional roles, especially among special effects technicians and extras, raising fears of job losses.These concerns were central to last year's strike by actors and writers, culminating in an agreement that included compensation for the use of AI-generated likenesses. Despite apprehensions, AI is already extensively used in the industry. For example, it was employed to de-age Harrison Ford in the latest ""Indiana Jones"" film, though studios often refrain from publicising these uses.Beyond film production, AI's applications are expanding in various sectors of the media. The Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media, for instance, uses algorithms to analyse screenplays for gender and diversity biases. YouTube, a significant player in film promotion and distribution, has leveraged AI for over a decade, employing it for automated subtitles and copyright protections.Since April, YouTube has begun labelling AI-generated content and enhancing its detection programs.

Watch: Sam Altman shares how he spent the 4-and-a-half days he was sacked as ChatGPT maker OpenAI CEO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/watch-sam-altman-shares-how-he-spent-the-four-and-a-half-days-he-was-sacked-as-chatgpt-maker-openai-ceo/articleshow/110203159.cms,"Sam Altman talks GPT-4o and Predicts the Future of AI

The big lesson learnt

Sam Altman , CEO of OpenAI , has been on a rollercoaster the last few years. Since the company's release of ChatGPT, he's widely regarded as the poster boy of Generative-AI world. He's met with world leaders, clashed with Elon Musk , and even joined the billionaire club. Amidst all this, he also got fired (briefly) from the company he co-founded.On a recent tech podcast ""The Logan Bartlett Show"", Altman said with a laugh that if he had more time to reflect, ""every day would have something crazy."" However, one truly surreal moment stands out: His four-day ousting from OpenAI.As reported by Business Insider, it wasn't the firing itself that was unreal. It was how he handled this bizarre situation. Altman described it as an ""insane, superjammed"" 4 ½ days where his body was in an ""adrenaline-charged state.""Within a day of being fired, world leaders started texting. He received messages from 10-20 presidents and prime ministers. He said it felt normal at the time, and he even thanked them without batting an eye.""It was just weird,"" Altman admitted. He barely slept or ate, but his focus and energy were off the charts.Once he got his job back, reality hit him. Stopping at a diner, he realized he hadn't eaten in days. Naturally, he celebrated with a feast: four ""heavy"" meals and two milkshakes (just for him!).The celebratory meal was great, but the real shocker came later. A president texted him, relieved things were settled.Suddenly, Altman realized how bizarre it all was. World leaders texting him during his firing shouldn't have felt normal, but it did. It showed him just how adaptable humans are.""We can get used to anything as the new normal, good or bad, pretty fast,"" Altman said. He sees this as a strength – humans can adapt to almost anything.""My takeaway is human adaptability to almost anything is just, like, much more remarkably strong than we realize,"" Altman said on the podcast. ""And you can get used to anything as the new normal, good or bad, pretty fast.""","Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, has been on a rollercoaster the last few years.
