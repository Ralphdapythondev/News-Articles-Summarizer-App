Apple’s ‘Ferret-UI’ AI model could change the way we use our iPhones,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/apples-ferret-ui-ai-model-could-change-the-way-we-use-our-iphones/articleshow/109200080.cms,"A closer look at Ferret-UI's capabilities



The future of smartphones

Apple researchers have recently published a paper introducing Ferret-UI , a multimodal large language model (MLLM) designed to understand and navigate mobile user interfaces. This development could potentially lead to significant improvements in how we interact with our smartphones, including a more capable and intuitive Siri.Ferret-UI has been trained to comprehend the unique aspects of smartphone displays, such as varying aspect ratios and small icons and buttons.By understanding the content and layout of mobile screens, this AI model could open up new possibilities for smartphone interaction .The research paper outlines how Ferret-UI has been trained on a wide range of UI tasks, including icon recognition, text spotting, and widget classification. This extensive training allows the AI model to not only understand what's being displayed on a smartphone screen but also to navigate through it based on user prompts.The potential applications of this technology are diverse. App developers could utilise Ferret-UI to test the usability of their creations before releasing them to the public. Accessibility features could also benefit, with the AI serving as an advanced screen reader that interprets the contents of a screen and performs actions based on user needs.Perhaps one of the most exciting prospects is the potential for a more advanced Siri that can navigate through apps and execute complex tasks based on voice commands. Imagine being able to ask Siri to book a flight, order food, or schedule an appointment without having to manually navigate through multiple apps.However, it's important to note that these potential applications are still theoretical at this stage. It remains to be seen how Apple will choose to implement Ferret-UI in its products and services.While Apple has been relatively quiet about its artificial intelligence research compared to its rivals, the company is making steady progress behind the scenes. CEO Tim Cook recently hinted at sharing more details about Apple's ongoing AI work later this year, fueling rumours that the upcoming Worldwide Developers Conference in June could serve as the stage for significant AI announcements. Rumours are that Apple may unveil a host of AI-powered features across its entire ecosystem, including iOS and macOS.","Ferret-UI is a multimodal large language model (MLLM) designed to understand and

The move positions Google to compete more aggressively with rivals Amazon and Microsoft in the rapidly growing cloud computing and AI markets .The Axion chip, built using Arm's Neoverse V2 CPU, promises to deliver up to 30% better performance than the fastest general-purpose Arm-based instances currently available in the cloud and up to 50% better performance and 60% better energy efficiency than comparable current-generation x86-based instances.Google has already begun deploying Axion-based servers to power several of its own services, including YouTube Ads, BigTable, Spanner, BigQuery, and Google Earth Engine.""Axion is but the latest in a long line of custom Google silicon,"" said Amin Vahdat, VP/GM of Machine Learning, Systems, and Cloud AI at Google. ""Customers and users who wish to maximise performance, reduce infrastructure costs, and meet sustainability goals have found that the rate of CPU improvements has slowed recently. Axion processors combine Google's silicon expertise with Arm's highest performing CPU cores to deliver instances with industry-leading performance and energy efficiency.""Google's announcement follows similar moves by competitors Amazon Web Services, which introduced its Graviton Arm chip in 2018, and Microsoft, which announced its own Arm-based processors in November 2023. The adoption of Arm-based chips in the cloud has been driven by the need for more energy-efficient and cost-effective solutions as organisations seek to reduce spending on cloud computing due to economic concerns.The Axion chip is underpinned by Titanium, a system of purpose-built custom silicon microcontrollers and tiered scale-out offloads that handle platform operations like networking and security, allowing the processors to dedicate more capacity to customer workloads.Google has also emphasised the chip's compatibility with the Arm ecosystem, contributing to the SystemReady Virtual Environment (VE) standard to ensure seamless deployment of Arm workloads on Google Cloud with minimal code rewrites.Customers will be able to use Axion in many Google Cloud services, including Google Compute Engine, Google Kubernetes Engine, Dataproc, Dataflow, Cloud Batch, and more. Several partners, such as Datadog, Elastic, OpenX, and Snap, have already expressed interest in evaluating the new processor for potential performance and sustainability gains.The battle for dominance in the cloud computing and AI markets is set to heat up, with custom Arm-based processors emerging as a key battleground. Google's entry into the custom Arm-based processor market will be intensify competition among the major cloud providers as they seek to differentiate their offerings and capture a larger share of the growing demand for AI and cloud computing services. The move also highlights the increasing importance of custom silicon in the data centre, as providers look to optimise performance, energy efficiency, and cost for their customers.","Google unveils its new Axion chip, built using Arm's Neoverse V2 CPU.

Why some offline mobile retailers in India are unhappy with Apple,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/mobiles-tabs/why-some-offline-mobile-retailers-in-india-are-unhappy-with-apple/articleshow/109170559.cms,"Why mobile retailers are upset with Apple



What AIMRA’s letter to Apple says



“It has come to our attention that LFRs and company's own stores are offering a substantial cashback of Rs 10,000 on 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max models, while the retail channels are restricted to Rs 3,000 on the same models.

This is a purely anti-competitive move favouring a few. This discrepancy not only poses a significant risk of loss in sales for the retail channels but also raises concerns about unfair competition.

It may potentially divert our loyal customers to LFRs derogatorily. Such actions undermine the trust and confidence we have diligently built with our customers over time. We eagerly anticipate a prompt correction in the cash-back offer for the SKUs.

AIMRA firmly believes in fostering transparent and equitable business practices that uphold the interests of all stakeholders. We are committed to collaborating with Apple India to find constructive solutions that address these challenges while strengthening our partnership.”

India’s offline mobile retailers association — All India Mobile Retailers Association ( AIMRA ) – seems to be upset with Apple. The trade body has called out Apple India for what it calls “discriminatory pricing”.In a letter to Apple, AIMRA has slammed the exclusive cashback offers on top-end iPhone 15 series models, iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max , at Apple’s authorised stores.The offline mobile retailers association has accused the iPhone maker of hurting their sales with its cashback offers on iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max models.Apple announced a cashback offer for its iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max models on April 6. According to AIMRA, which represents over 150,000 mobile phone retailers, the company has allowed Apple stores as well as large format retailers to offer a cashback of Rs 10,000 on iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max models. Meanwhile, Apple allegedly restricted other retail channels to offer only Rs 3,000 cashback on the same models.In the letter sent to Apple India’s managing director, Ashish Chowdhary (seen by Financial Express), AIMRA’s national joint general secretary, Navneet Pathak, said:","All India Mobile Retailers Association ( AIMRA) is upset with Apple.

Apple is expected to launch its next-generation iPhone 16 series later this year. The smartphones in the lineup are expected to arrive with multiple new updates and may pack bigger batteries compared to their predecessors. However, Apple is reportedly planning to launch the iPhone 16 Plus model with a smaller battery than its predecessor.A tipster named OvO Baby Sauce OvO took to the Chinese social media platform Weibo to reveal that the iPhone 16 Plus may have a smaller battery capacity compared to last year’s iPhone 15 Plus model.The figures shared by the leaker match the ones which were revealed by another leaker Majin Bu on the micro-blogging site X (previously Twitter) in February.However, this post missed out on the battery capacity that is expected to arrive for the iPhone 16 Pro model. So, the latest leak reveals the alleged iPhone 16 battery capacity changes across the board.Apart from the size difference, both the iPhone 16 and the iPhone 16 Plus models are expected to have an identical set of features. According to a report by MacRumors, the reduction in the battery will turn out to be negligible in real terms as the model may get efficiency improvements in other areas.As per the report, by reducing capacity, Apple might be trying to maximise differentiation between the iPhone 16 Plus and the iPhone 16 Pro Max. With this change, the company might be attempting to nudge its customers toward the premium features (and prices) of its top-tier model. Here’s the list comparing battery capacities between iPhone 15 and 16 models that was shared on Weibo:Apple replaced the iPhone 13 mini with the iPhone 14 Plus model in 2022. The Plus model allowed customers to own a device with the same 6.7-inch display as the iPhone 14 Pro Max without paying a premium.Apart from this, the iPhone 14 Plus model’s battery had a larger capacity than the iPhone 14 Pro Max, which allowed Apple to promote the device for featuring ""longest battery life.""However, with the launch of the iPhone 15 series, Apple increased the battery capacity of the iPhone 15 Pro Max to make it the largest battery ever used in an iPhone.Another rumour suggests that this year's ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ Max will boast an even bigger 30-hour-plus battery life (compared to 29 hours for the iPhone 15 Pro Max).Moreover, both the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max are expected to have slightly larger displays.","A tipster named OvO Baby Sauce OvO took to the Chinese social media platform

Ultrasonic fingerprint sensors on OnePlus, Oppo and Realme phones



Smartphone brands under the BBK Electronics umbrella, including OnePlus , Oppo and Realme , are planning to introduce ultrasonic fingerprint sensors for their flagship models. In a post on the Chinese social media platform Weibo, a tipster named Digital Chat Station claimed that these smartphone makers are expected to use the newer technology of biometric authentication for their flagship offerings.Smartphone makers started offering in-display fingerprint authentication on multiple models for a few years now. For this system, phone brands use two types of fingerprint sensors -- ultrasonic and optical sensors. The ultrasonic sensors are usually found on premium flagship smartphones .When a finger is pressed against an ultrasonic fingerprint scanner, it creates a 3D map of the fingerprint by using ultrasonic sound waves beneath the screen.This technology offers more security and is less susceptible to spoofing. Ultrasonic fingerprint sensors are also water resistant and smudges with high detection accuracy.However, these scanners are expensive to manufacture and the process is also complex compared to optical fingerprint scanners .Meanwhile, optical fingerprint scanners are less expensive and secure and use light to capture 2D images of the fingerprint.As per the Weibo post, OnePlus, Oppo and Realme are working on an ultrasonic in-screen fingerprint scanner for their devices. If things go well, the technology is expected to replace the optical fingerprint scanner on their flagship devices in the coming days. Apart from this, the tipster didn’t reveal any additional details.Currently, the Samsung Galaxy S23 series, iQ00 12 Pro, Meizu 21/21 Pro, and other phones use an ultrasonic fingerprint sensor uses this technology.Earlier reports suggested that the upcoming Xiaomi 15 series which may come powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 chipset is also expected to come equipped with Goodix’s single-point ultrasonic fingerprint scanner technology.","Ultrasonic fingerprint sensors on OnePlus, Oppo and Realme phones are in the

The investigation comes after numerous complaints from PC gamers experiencing frequent crashes and instability, particularly in games using the Unreal Engine .""Intel is aware of problems that occur when executing certain tasks on 13th and 14th generation core processors for desktop PCs, and is analysing them with major affiliates,"" an Intel spokesperson told ZDNet Korea.The affected CPUs include the Core i9-13900K and Core i9-14900K, with users reporting crashes in popular titles such as Fortnite , Tekken 8, and Hogwarts Legacy. Some gamers have experienced an ""out of video memory"" error, while others have faced sudden game exits or complete system lockups.The issue has become so prevalent that Epic Games , the Fortnite and the Unreal Engine developer developer, has published a support notice advising affected users to adjust their BIOS settings to mitigate the crashes. The suggested workarounds involve manually downclocking or undervolting the Intel processors , leading to concerns about these high-end CPUs' stability and performance.In South Korea , the problem has escalated to the point where PC retailers are reporting a significant increase in CPU returns and exchanges. ""The number of consumers visiting the customer center asking to change their 13th and 14th generation core processors has recently increased to more than ten per day,"" stated one company official.The exact cause of the crashes remains unclear, but the widespread nature of the reports has prompted Intel to launch an investigation in collaboration with major affiliates. The company has not yet provided a timeline for the investigation or any potential fixes.The game crashes have raised questions about whether Intel has pushed the clock speeds of its latest CPUs too far, sacrificing stability for performance. Some users have even accused the company of selling unstable processors. The issue has also highlighted the importance of thorough testing and validation before releasing new hardware to the market.Intel is currently investigating the root cause of system crashes that are affecting some of its users. Unfortunately, there are limited options available for affected users to maintain system stability. While downclocking or undervolting the CPUs may provide temporary solution, many gamers are frustrated by the need to compromise on performance to ensure a crash-free experience.","Intel is looking into reports of stability issues and game crashes affecting its

Microsoft ending Windows 10 support on October 2025: How much users will have to pay to continue using it,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/laptops-pc/this-is-how-much-you-have-to-pay-to-continue-using-windows-10/articleshow/109014624.cms,"Windows 10 Extended Security Updates (ESU): Price, availability and more



What the company has to say



Microsoft is set to end the support for Windows 10 on October 14, 2025. However, the tech giant will allow its customers to continue using the older operating system securely. To continue using Windows 10 after the mentioned date, users have to pay a yearly fee. Microsoft has announced that it will offer Extended Security Updates ( ESU ) for Windows 10 usersUsers who want to use Windows 10 after October 2025 have to pay a subscription of $61 (nearly Rs 5,000) for the first year.This is the first time Microsoft will be offering its Windows 10 customers additional security updates for a price.Both businesses and individual customers will need to purchase ESU licenses for each Windows 10 device they plan to keep using after the end of the support cutoff date.Users have to pay $61 for the first year and for the next year, the price will be doubled to $122 for the second year. The price will then double again in year three to $244. Users who enter the ESU program in year two will have to pay for the first year as the ESUs are cumulative.Typically, Microsoft offers subscriptions for Extended Security Updates only to organisations that need to keep running older versions of Windows. However, this time it’ll be different, as there are still a large number of users who still use Windows 10 nearly nine years since its release in 2015.Apart from this, Microsoft is also offering a 25% discount to businesses for using a Microsoft cloud-based update solution like Intune or Windows Autopatch. This will reduce the pricing to $45 per user (up to five devices) for the first year.For users, who use Windows 10 laptops and PCs to connect to Windows 11 Cloud PCs through Windows 365, Microsoft will waive the fees for security updates since licenses will be included in the Windows 365 subscription cost.Schools will get an even bigger discount as Microsoft will offer a $1 license for year one, which will then double to $2 for year two and $4 for the third year. However, the company doesn’t seem to offer any special discount pricing for consumers, but we’re still months away from these licenses going on sale and the company may offer something for individual customers in the coming months.In a blog post, Microsoft explains: “Extended Security Updates are not intended to be a long-term solution but rather a temporary bridge. You can purchase ESU licenses for Windows 10 devices that you don’t plan to upgrade to Windows 11 starting in October 2024, one year before the end of support date.”Microsoft wants consumers to update to Windows 1, however, millions of PC users can’t upgrade officially to the latest operating system due to more strict hardware requirements and the company’s security push with its latest OS. For the unaware, Windows 11 is only supported on CPUs released after 2018 and works only with devices that support TPM security chips.As a result, Windows 11 has lagged behind the Windows 10 rollout, which was offered to Windows 7 and Windows 8 users as a free upgrade. It is important to note that Windows 11 was also offered as a free upgrade, but it worked only for Windows 10 machines that met the strict minimum hardware requirements.According to data from StatCounter, Windows 10 is still used by 69% of all Windows users , compared to just 27% for Windows 11. Microsoft may fail to close this gap in the next 18 months and may leave many Windows 10 users with no option other than paying for the security updates.","Microsoft is set to end the support for Windows 10 on October 14, 2025.

GTA 6 trailer sets new records; here's what making the waves,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/gaming/gta-6-trailer-sets-new-records-heres-what-making-the-waves/articleshow/109182770.cms,"Watch GTA 6 Trailer:

Grand Theft Auto VI Trailer 1

Discord Accidentally Overshadowed the GTA 6 Trailer with Spoofed YouTube Views

Discord Loot Boxes are here.

The Grand Theft Auto 6 trailer has reclaimed its title for the most-watched YouTube video in the first 24 hours after release. This record was briefly lost due to an April Fools' joke that took an unexpected turn.The prank was originally intended to enhance Discord's playful social media presence. Discord unveiled a trailer announcing native loot boxes for its users as part of the joke.The stunt included actual loot boxes within the app, which are still accessible as of April 6. While many gaming companies participated in April Fools' activities, this particular joke gained significant traction, accumulating over 1.3 billion views by April 2.As reported by Game Rant on April 6, the vast majority of the views on the GTA 6 trailer have been removed. The current view count of the video has significantly decreased to around 3 million. Consequently, the GTA 6 trailer has regained its YouTube debut record, now standing at approximately 93 million views in 24 hours. The temporary switch in record holders appears to have resulted from the chat app inadvertently spoofing its own YouTube views.According to Marvin Wizz from DiscordPreviews, the loot box trailer released on April 1 was distributed to users through Discord's non-intrusive toast notification system. This method made it more likely for users to overlook the notification, compounded by the fact that the video played in a loop. The developer's surprise was evident in an April 2 message posted by a verified Discord developer on the ""discord-api"" server, expressing disbelief at the video's unexpected popularity and views. This suggests that the unintentional visibility was not part of Discord's planned marketing strategy.Although spoofing views is typically a violation of YouTube's policies that could result in penalties, it seems that Discord's actions were unintentional and not aimed at gaming the system. Therefore, the company's channel is unlikely to face sanctions. Discord's PR team embraced the situation with humour, referring to it as a ""whoopsie doopsie"" in an April 2 tweet.With the correction of the view-botting incident, the GTA 6 trailer's record for launch day viewership appears secure once again. The previous record holder was MrBeast's ""Every Country On Earth Fights For $250,000"" video, which garnered over 59 million views within the first 24 hours after its debut in August 2023. While there's a possibility that a future GTA 6 trailer could surpass the 93 million views, it's not guaranteed. Historical data from previous 3D entries in the franchise suggests that debut trailers often had stronger momentum compared to subsequent ones.Also read | GTA 6 Release date, trailers, characters, and all that we know so far","GTA 6 trailer reclaims YouTube record for most-watched video in first 24 hours

""We are building on our strong history of delivering backwards compatibility to our players, and we remain committed to bringing forward the amazing library of Xbox games for future generations of players to enjoy,"" Bond stated.Game preservation has become an increasingly pressing issue in recent years due to the prevalence of online requirements and digital formats. Many modern games, particularly live service titles, are unplayable without an internet connection and risk disappearing permanently when servers are shut down. Even single-player games with microtransactions often require online connectivity, putting them at risk of eventual inaccessibility.Microsoft's commitment to game preservation aligns with its strong track record of backward compatibility. The Xbox 360 backward compatibility program, which allows players to enjoy hundreds of popular Xbox 360 games on Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S consoles, remains one of the platform's most beloved features.Bond's email also touched on Microsoft's recent successes, including the integration of Activision Blizzard King titles into Xbox services. The launch of Diablo IV on Xbox Game Pass has quickly made Xbox the game's most popular platform.

Anime's popularity has surged in the West in recent years, thanks to streaming platforms like Crunchyroll and Netflix, which have introduced viewers to numerous hidden gems within the medium. This includes classic anime series that, despite their immense popularity in Japan, were not originally broadcast in the West.However, the vast selection of anime available today can feel overwhelming, with new series being introduced every anime season.Nevertheless, the best anime series of all time remain timeless and continue to inspire countless others even years after their initial debut.According to Game Rant, here is a list of the top anime series that have endured the test of time and represent some of the finest offerings within the medium.Few intellectual properties can rival the longevity of Akira Toriyama's Dragon Ball, which has maintained its popularity for nearly four decades. Despite some lulls, such as the 18-year gap between Dragon Ball Z and Dragon Ball Super, and not every arc or episode being of the highest quality, the franchise remains hugely popular in both Japan and the West.At its peak, Dragon Ball stands out as one of the most entertaining anime series, with a significant impact on popularising anime in the West. Many consider Dragon Ball one of the most important anime series ever made, attributed to its compelling storylines, memorable villains, and thrilling action scenes. Combining these factors, Dragon Ball is often argued to be among thebest anime series of all time, if not the very best.One Piece took a bit longer to gain traction in the West compared to some other notable Shonen anime series. However, once it did, it consistently captivated Western audiences. Similarly, One Piece has enjoyed enduring popularity in Japan, with multiple generations growing up with this beloved manga and anime series.The manga holds a Guinness World Record for the highest number of copies published by a single author and was the best-selling manga for eleven consecutive years from 2008 to 2018. The anime adaptation has also been incredibly successful and has remained faithful to the source material, with only occasional minor deviations, much to the delight of fans of the series.Mecha anime gained popularity in the sixties and seventies, but it wasn't until the nineties that the genre truly exploded. Throughout the decade, numerous impressive mecha anime series were introduced, but none have matched the enduring popularity of Hideaki Anno's Neon Genesis Evangelion and its various spin-offs and big-screen adaptations.Featuring intricately crafted storylines and breathtaking set-piece battles, the series packed a lot into its initial 26-episode run and remains highly acclaimed today. Subsequent adaptations have also been excellent, though determining the optimal viewing order can be challenging and has sparked spirited debates among Evangelion fans over the years.When it comes to anime adaptations, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood stands out for its exceptional faithfulness to the manga. Across its 64 episodes, it remains remarkably true to the original source material in terms of storyline and visual style. While there is some filler content, it never disrupts the narrative flow.The relationship between Edward and Alphonse is a highlight of the series, closely followed by its intricate plot and unexpected twists. Following the mixed reception of the original series, most Fullmetal Alchemist fans were thrilled with Brotherhood's fidelity to the source material and appreciated the studio's responsiveness to earlier criticism regarding changes.Also read | Roblox: Blox Fruits Codes April 2024, how to play, steps to redeem codes for Blox Fruits, and other information Cowboy Bebop is often revered, and while it may not be flawless, its impact on the anime medium cannot be ignored. It has influenced numerous anime, manga, Western films, and television shows over the years.At its core, Cowboy Bebop is a neo-noir sci-fi series following the adventures of a group of bounty hunters in outer space. Its impressive blend of multiple genres contributes significantly to its esteemed reputation among fans. While it may not claim the title of the best anime series of all time, it certainly ranks among the top.Pokemon made a monumental impact when it burst onto the scene in the mid-to-late nineties, captivating audiences worldwide with its trading card game, video games, and anime. Initially viewed as a marketing tool for the wider Pokemon franchise, the anime evolved over time into one of the greatest series of all time.While it may appear superficial on the surface, the Pokemon anime has delved into a diverse range of themes and ideas over its more than quarter-century run, offering viewers intriguing perspectives and positive life messages. Its enduring popularity spans multiple generations, with millions of viewers growing up watching the beloved creature-collecting series.It's challenging to pinpoint a single volume of Jojo's Bizarre Adventure because they are all exceptional. When fans of the popular seinen manga learned about the decision to create an anime adaptation to commemorate the series' 25th anniversary, there was some apprehension. However, the resulting series has proven to be just as impressive as the source material and has introduced the world of JoJo to a new generation of viewers.The first five seasons of the show encompass the first six parts of the manga, suggesting that there are likely at least two more seasons to come. Following the conclusion of Stone Ocean, fans can anticipate adaptations of Steel Ball Run and Jojolion. By that time, JOJOLANDS may also be released and approaching its climax, potentially allowing both the show and the long-running manga to conclude around the same time.Similar to Dragon Ball, Naruto originated in the pages of the Japanese publication Weekly Shōnen Jump. After its successful debut in 1999, it was adapted into an anime in late 2002. The resulting series comprised 220 episodes, with the first 135 following the initial part of the manga and the remainder featuring an original storyline based on unused plot elements from creator Masashi Kishimoto's concepts.The series explores various themes and incorporates elements from Asian mythology. However, at its core, it chronicles the journey of a young boy aspiring to become the leader of his village and ultimately one of the greatest ninjas of all time. For those seeking more, Boruto continues the narrative with Naruto's son in the same world, though many fans argue that the original series is more compelling.Like Sword Art Online and the Fate series, Death Note is often considered a gateway anime, drawing new viewers into the medium. Despite this, seasoned anime fans sometimes criticise its plot and point to other supposedly superior shows. Nevertheless, there's a compelling reason why Death Note is recommended to newcomers exploring anime for the first time.For better or worse, Death Note is highly accessible, featuring an easy-to-follow plot and a captivating cast of characters. The intellectual battle between Light and L in the initial part of the anime is enthralling and unpredictable. While it does incorporate some anime tropes, Death Note is less exaggerated compared to many other series of its time, making it appealing to a broader audience demographic.Despite being relatively new, Demon Slayer deserves recognition among the best anime series of all time. In just six years since its creation, it has generated around $10 billion in revenue, rivalling established media franchises like Thomas the Tank Engine and Sesame Street, which have been around for over half a century.Demon Slayer's phenomenal success can be attributed to its compelling plot, intriguing characters, and outstanding animation that vividly brings the source material to life. With more content on the horizon, the series continues to ascend in commercial success and critical acclaim, promising even greater achievements in the future.While the anime adaptation of Slam Dunk didn't achieve the same level of success as the best-selling manga, it remains a well-crafted series and essential viewing for serious sports anime enthusiasts. The story follows Hanamichi Sakuragi, a delinquent high schooler who takes up basketball to impress a girl.As Sakuragi discovers his natural athletic ability and basketball talent, he joins forces with other misfits and oddballs to elevate the Shohoku basketball team into one of Japan's top teams. With Sakuragi as their unstoppable power forward, they set their sights on winning the national championship.Despite its increasingly complex plot, Attack on Titan remains a compelling anime with an excellent cast of characters and intriguing storylines. The visuals are outstanding; however, viewers sensitive to violence should be cautious as the series is gritty and gory from the start.The narrative revolves around Eren Jaeger, living in a world where humanity faces extinction from giant human-eating creatures called Titans. After witnessing his hometown's destruction and his mother's death, Eren joins the Survey Corps with a vow to eradicate Titans. As the story progresses, new layers of complexity emerge, adding depth to the plot.Steins;Gate, one of the most popular visual novel games, was a natural choice for adaptation into a manga and later an anime by 5pb. The anime debuted about two years after the game's release, introducing Rintaro and Kurisu to a new audience of psychological thriller enthusiasts.While faithfully following the game's storyline, many consider the Steins;Gate anime the definitive way to experience this science fiction narrative, evident from its nearly flawless user ratings online. For those craving more, the Steins;Gate 0 anime, released in 2018, continues the original series' story.Vinland Saga is adapted from the acclaimed historical manga series of the same name, following Icelandic explorer Thorfinn Karlsefni on his journey to discover Vinland, a legendary coastal region. As Thorfinn's expedition unfolds, the narrative delves into weighty themes like slavery, war, and betrayal.While many successful anime series thrive on expansive casts of characters, Vinland Saga is primarily Thorfinn's story. Although other notable characters are introduced, it is Thorfinn's personal growth that truly captivates viewers and drives the anime's compelling narrative.Like many exceptional anime series, Fruits Basket originated as a manga in 1998 before receiving its initial anime adaptation in 2001. However, the series' second adaptation, which premiered almost two decades later in 2019, is widely regarded as the definitive rendition of this captivating genre-blending story.The narrative revolves around Tohru, a young orphan taken in by the enigmatic Sohma family. Despite their outward appearances, the Sohmas harbour a startling secret that only manifests under specific circumstances. This captivating blend of romance and drama solidifies Fruits Basket as one of the finest shojo anime series and a must-watch for fans of the genre.Also read | Apple Watch Series 9 available for Rs 13,680 on Amazon; here's how you can grab the deal","Anime's popularity has surged in the West in recent years, thanks to streaming
