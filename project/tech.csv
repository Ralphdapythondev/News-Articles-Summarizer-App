How Google’s AI team taught robots to play football,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-googles-ai-team-taught-robots-to-play-football/articleshow/109288571.cms,"How Google trained model to train robots like football players

The use cases of artificial intelligence (AI) are not limited to chatbots. Companies are also imparting training to models that in turn bring robots to life and help humans in various tasks. Google, in a slightly different approach, has taught robots to play football.Google DeepMind , the company’s AI arm, trained its AI agents for a bipedal robot to demonstrate a range of agile behaviours using reinforcement learning.“Soccer players have to master a range of dynamic skills, from turning and kicking to chasing a ball. How could robots do the same?” Google DeepMind said in a post on X.In a paper published in journal Science, the company explains that generating robust motor skills in bipedal robots in the real world is challenging because of the inability of current control methods to generalise to specific tasks.Hence, a team of researchers created a deep reinforcement learning framework for controlling the entire body of humanoid robots. This framework allowed the robots to play one-on-one soccer.The robots developed new behaviours on their own, including dynamic movements like recovering from falls and strategic tactics like defending the ball. The robots, using this framework, moved faster than those with a traditional scripted controller. This suggests the framework may be useful for even more complex interactions between multiple robots.“Robotics has long used games like soccer to test complex motion, coordination and environment awareness. Our agents were trained in simulation using the MuJoCo physics engine, and then transferred to small humanoid robots with 20 actuated joints,” it said.The team said that this helped robots achieve faster walking, turning, kicking, and standing compared to robots with pre-programmed skills. Additionally, they demonstrated the ability to combine these movements to score goals, anticipate the ball's trajectory, and block opponent shots.","Google DeepMind trained its AI agents for a bipedal robot to demonstrate a range of agile behaviours using reinforcement learning.

Elon Musk's X may stop users from hiding blue checkmarks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/social/elon-musks-x-may-stop-users-from-hiding-blue-checkmarks/articleshow/109288114.cms,"X Blue checkmarks: What are they and why it’s important



Elon Musk-owned social media platform X (previously Twitter ) has reportedly stopped allowing users to hide their blue checks. This default setting will apply to both non-paid and paid Premium users . The X app has reportedly started notifying users about the same.In a post shared by app developer Nima Owji included a screenshot which showed a message from X.The app notified users that “the hide your checkmark feature of X Premium is going away soon.”Earlier this month, X started adding blue checks to the accounts of “influential” users who have at least 2,500 followers who pay for a premium subscription. Meanwhile, accounts with over 5,000 have received a free Premium Plus membership.Earlier, when X was Twitter and wasn’t owned by Musk, the verified symbol on the platform was usually applied to celebrities, politicians, journalists and others in the public eye. Soon after the billionaire’s acquisition, the platform rolled out its first-ever paid verification service. This meant anyone could obtain along with purchasing a Premium membership.Later on, the company started removing the checkmarks from celebrities on X users who refused to pay for them. Elon Musk also personally intervened to push it on people like Stephen King and LeBron James , however, it was eventually added to many accounts with more than a million followers (which also included verified accounts for several users who’d died or otherwise hadn’t requested for it).Now, the veriied checkmarks have started appearing on many influential X accounts with already large followings in the tens or hundreds of thousands (which may be due to the number of verified followings that cross the benchmark) are once again check-marked, or will be, whether they like it or not.Musk suggested that this change was meant to be a perks. However, some of his critics (including previously verified users) were less than pleased with the blue badge appearing on their accounts lest others suspect them of actually paying for a subscription.","Elon Musk-owned social media platform X has reportedly stopped allowing users to hide their blue checks.

Grand Theft Auto 6 Trailer

Grand Theft Auto VI Trailer 1

The Grand Theft Auto (GTA) 6 trailer became one of the most popular video game trailers ever released. Such is the level of excitement and anticipation for the game that enthusiasts are now creating shot-for-shot real-life remakes of the GTA 6 trailer .According to Game Rant, YouTuber Andrew Levitt has meticulously recreated the Grand Theft Auto 6 trailer in Miami.The debut of Grand Theft Auto 6's official reveal trailer in December 2023 had a profound impact on the gaming community, garnering millions of views within hours and boosting Rockstar Games' YouTube channel subscribers to 10 million. This 90-second trailer also became the most liked gaming tweet of all time on Twitter.Grand Theft Auto 5 marked its tenth anniversary in September, and Rockstar's previous major release, Red Dead Redemption 2, reached five years old in October. It's been a considerable amount of time since Rockstar launched a major new game, fueling mounting anticipation for its next Grand Theft Auto instalment. The trailer introduced fans to the game's dual protagonists, Lucia and Jason. The thrilling 90-second reveal concluded by indicating a broad 2025 release window for Grand Theft Auto 6, prompting speculation about its potential release timing next year, with the possibility of being pushed to 2026.Grand Theft Auto 6 is an open-world crime game that transports players back to the vibrant, neon-lit streets of Vice City.While awaiting the next official update from Rockstar, renowned YouTuber Andrew Levitt has taken the initiative to recreate the entire Grand Theft Auto 6 trailer in real life. Travelling to Miami, the American city that inspired Grand Theft Auto's Vice City setting, Levitt meticulously captures real-world locations featured in the trailer. Leveraging original footage of specific real-world events depicted in the trailer, Levitt's recreation closely mirrors the original shots. He also incorporates the original trailer's audio, including the iconic track ""Love Is A Long Road"" by Tom Petty, which garnered increased attention on music streaming platforms following the trailer's debut in December.Andrew Levitt also shared a 12-minute behind-the-scenes video detailing his journey through Miami to capture the 38 unique shots of real-world locations that inspired the Grand Theft Auto 6 trailer. It was fascinating to witness the meticulous attention to detail, with Rockstar Games faithfully recreating areas of Miami for Vice City, including exact building facades and crosswalk art. Some scenes, like the penthouse pool party, were challenging for Levitt to access, leading him to use a drone camera to replicate several shots from the trailer.The Grand Theft Auto 6 trailer has accumulated a remarkable 185 million views on YouTube. Fans are eagerly anticipating the release of a second trailer from Rockstar. Despite the upcoming Summer Game Fest, Rockstar typically forgoes participation in industry-wide events, preferring to unveil updates independently. If the game remains on track for a 2025 release, there's a possibility that a second GTA 6 trailer, focusing more on characters and narrative elements, could be revealed later this year.Also read | Top-rated romance anime series for every fan; here's the list","YouTuber Andrew Levitt has recreated the Grand Theft Auto 6 trailer in Miami.

What this means for iPhone users

Apple’s ‘fix’ for stolen phones

Apple wants users to know their iPhone 'better'

Apple has said that it will change how it fixes iPhones starting this fall. People and repair shops will be able to use genuine Apple parts from old iPhones to fix newer iPhones.These changes will make it easier and cheaper for people to fix their iPhones, but at first, it will only work for iPhone 15 and newer phones. This will also give people more choices when they need to repair their iPhones, help iPhones last longer, and be better for the environment.At first, this new way of fixing iPhones will only work for some iPhone models.People will be able to use old screens, batteries, and cameras that will work just as well as new parts from Apple. In the future, Apple will also allow people to use old Face ID and Touch ID sensors in new iPhones.In a bid to streamline the repair process, Apple is making it easier for customers and service providers to order parts from its Self-Service Repair Store. No longer will you need to provide your device's serial number for most repairs, with the exception of logic board replacements. After putting in a new part, the iPhone will set it up to work properly.Apple wants to ensure that if an iPhone is lost or stolen, its parts cannot be removed and used to repair other iPhones.To do this, Apple is extending its ""Activation Lock"" feature, which prevents stolen iPhones from being used, to individual iPhone parts. If a part is taken from an iPhone that has been reported lost or stolen and has Activation Lock enabled, that part won't function properly when installed in another iPhone during a repair.Here's how it will work: if you are repairing an iPhone and you put in a part from another iPhone, your iPhone will check to see if it comes from a reported lost or stolen iPhone. If it does, your iPhone won't let that part work as it should.Not only that, but Apple wants people to know what parts are in their iPhones and if they are new or used. Starting in the fall of this year, when someone goes to the Settings app on their iPhone, they will be able to find a section that tells them about the parts in their phone.In this section, people will be able to see a list of the important parts in their iPhone, like the screen, battery, camera, and more. Next to each part, there will be information telling the user if that part is brand new or if it is a used genuine Apple part.John Ternus , Apple's senior vice president of Hardware Engineering , stated, ""With this latest expansion to our repair program, we're excited to be adding even more choice and convenience for our customers while helping to extend the life of our products and their parts.""","Apple has said that it will change how it fixes iPhones starting this fall.

The company is experimenting with displaying promoted apps in the ""Recommended"" section, which echoes its previous attempts to integrate ads into its operating system .Currently limited to Windows Insiders in the Beta Channel within the United States , the ads should help users discover apps from the Microsoft Store , says Microsoft.By placing promoted apps alongside recently installed and frequently used programs, Microsoft hopes to increase exposure for its store offerings.While the promoted apps can be disabled through the Settings app, some users argue that this adds to the growing list of toggles and settings that need to be adjusted to achieve a clean, ad-free Windows 11 experience. The lack of a clear ""Promoted"" label next to the app name has also raised concerns about transparency, as users may not immediately realise that they are being presented with an advertisement rather than a personally relevant recommendation.Microsoft is seeking feedback on the changes, suggesting that the company may be open to modifying or removing the feature based on user response. The Windows Insider team has stated that the experiment will not apply to commercial devices managed by organisations, perhaps acknowledging the potential for disruption in professional settings.Critics of the move argue that Microsoft should focus on refining the Start menu's functionality and customization options rather than using it as a vehicle for advertising. Some have pointed out that the company already has ample opportunities to showcase its store offerings through the Microsoft Store app itself, as well as through other channels such as email newsletters and targeted online ads.Microsoft has a history of incorporating ads into its Windows operating system, with previous versions featuring promotional spots on the lock screen and Start menu. The company even briefly tested ads within the File Explorer of Windows 11 last year before turning off the experiment due to negative feedback from users. This latest move to introduce ads in the Windows 11 Start menu has reignited concerns about the creeping commercialization of the user interface.","Microsoft has begun testing ads within the Windows 11 Start menu.

The Computer Emergency Response Team ( CERT-in ) has issued a warning for users of various Microsoft products including Windows 10, Windows 11 and Microsoft Office . The cybersecurity watchdog has reported security bypass vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows products that could be exploited by the attacker to compromise the targeted system.The agency, which comes under the Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology, classified the vulnerability as ‘critical’ on the severity scale.“Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in Microsoft Windows which could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code, bypass security features, and compromise the targeted system,” Cert-In said.As per the agency, the vulnerabilities exist due to improper access restrictions within the proxy driver and insufficient implementation of the Mark of the Web (MoW) feature in Microsoft Windows.“The SmartScreen security feature protection mechanism bypasses the Mark of the Web (MotW) feature and allows malware to execute on a target system. The threat actors may exploit these vulnerabilities by sending specially crafted request,” it added.The products include -- Microsoft Windows, Microsoft Office, Developer Tools, Azure, Brower, System Center, Microsoft Dynamics, and Exchange Server.The agency advised users to apply appropriate security updates as mentioned in the company's update guide.Earlier this year, CERT-in issued a warning for users of Windows 10 and Windows 11 users, saying a vulnerability in Microsoft Windows Kernel that could be exploited by the attacker to gain elevated privileges on the targeted system.It classified the vulnerability – spotted in both 32-bit and x64-based systems – as ‘high’ on the severity scale.

Microsoft to Windows 10 users: It may be time to upgrade,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/laptops-pc/microsoft-to-windows-10-users-it-may-be-time-to-upgrade/articleshow/109226897.cms,"Microsoft has begun displaying full-screen prompts to Windows 10 users , urging them to upgrade to Windows 11 or purchase a new PC as the end of support date for Windows 10 approaches. The prompts, reading ""A new journey with Windows...,"" appeared after the recent Patch Tuesday updates, shown to users with PCs that are ineligible for the Windows 11 upgrade due to hardware requirements.The full-screen prompt thanks users for their loyalty to Windows 10 and warns them about the approaching end of life (EOL) date. It also encourages users to learn more about transitioning to a new Windows 11 PC. Notably, the prompt does not allow permanently dismissing the message.Users with Windows 10 PCs that do not meet the hardware requirements for Windows 11 have two options to remain secure beyond the EOL date: purchase a new PC with Windows 11 or pay Microsoft for extended security updates (ESU) on Windows 10. While pricing for ESU has not been revealed for individual users, business customers will have to pay $61 per device for the first year, with the cost doubling each subsequent year.Microsoft's decision to use full-screen prompts to encourage upgrades is not unprecedented. The company employed similar tactics during the transition from Windows 7 to Windows 10 nearly five years ago. While some users may find the prompts intrusive, Microsoft believes it is essential to inform users about the upcoming end-of-support date and the available options to maintain the security of their devices.The slower uptake of Windows 11 compared to its predecessor can be attributed to the more stringent hardware requirements, which include CPUs released from 2018 onward and devices that support TPM security chips integrated into the latest CPUs.

It plans to introduce a new family of in-house M4 chips designed to showcase artificial intelligence capabilities. According to people familiar with the matter, the company is already nearing production of the next-generation chips, just five months after releasing the first M3-powered Macs.The M4 chip will come in at least three main varieties, and Apple aims to update every Mac model with the new chipset.The iMacs, MacBook Pros, and Mac minis are all slated to receive the M4 upgrade. However, the company's plans are subject to change.This move comes at a critical juncture for Apple, as Mac sales have experienced a significant decline in the past year. The company hopes that the AI-focused M4 chips will breathe new life into its computer business and help it catch up with competitors like Microsoft and Google in artificial intelligence.The M4 chip line will include an entry-level version called Donan, more powerful models named Brava, and a top-end chip codenamed Hidra. Apple plans to highlight the AI processing capabilities of these components and demonstrate how they will seamlessly integrate with the upcoming version of macOS, which will be announced at the company's annual developer conference in June.In addition to the M4 upgrades, Apple is considering allowing its highest-end Mac desktops to support up to half a terabyte of memory, a significant increase from the current maximum of 192 gigabytes. The move would address customers' complaints about the memory limitations of Apple's in-house chips compared to previous Intel-powered machines.As Apple gears up for the AI-centric M4 Macs, the company plans to preview a host of new AI features across its product lineup at the upcoming developer conference. Many of these features are designed to run on Macs rather than relying on remote servers, making the M4 chips a crucial component in driving these enhancements.As for when to expect these? The new M4-powered Mac models are expected to hit the market beginning late 2024 and until into early 2025,","Apple plans to introduce a new family of in-house M4 chips designed to showcase artificial intelligence capabilities.

Microsoft is gearing up to unveil its vision for “AI PCs” at a Seattle event next month. A report has said that these PCs are expected to be powered by Arm-based processors from Qualcomm , and the Windows maker is confident that they will be able to outperform Apple 's M3-powered MacBook Air in both CPU performance and AI-accelerated tasks.Citing sources familiar with their plans, The Verge reported that Microsoft is confident that a new generation of Arm-powered Windows laptops with the upcoming Snapdragon X Elite processors will deliver the performance necessary for a more aggressive push into Windows on Arm.They are placing a significant bet on these processors, which are expected to be included in various Windows laptops launching this year, including their latest consumer Surface devices. The report also claims that Microsoft is planning to ship consumer models of its upcoming Surface Pro 10 and Surface Laptop 6 with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X Elite processors inside instead of Intel’s Core Ultra chips.The company has already launched the business versions of its Surface lineup with the newest Intel Core Ultra chips.Reportedly, Microsoft is so confident in these new Qualcomm chips that it is said to be planning demos that will show how these processors will be faster than an M3 MacBook Air for CPU tasks, AI acceleration, and even app emulation.Microsoft is already moving quickly towards an AI-first future with incorporating Copilot in its services and products. Microsoft is likely to reap benefits of a boost in CPU tasks and AI with these new processors. Moreover, these PCs will get access to new AI-powered Windows features first, the report said.Furthermore, Microsoft describes devices running Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite processors as “next-gen AI Copilot PCs” internally, which are meant to differentiate them from existing PCs that run on AMD’s latest chips or even Intel’s Core Ultra processors.",Microsoft is gearing up to unveil its vision for ‘AI PCs’ at a Seattle event next month.

The investigation comes after numerous complaints from PC gamers experiencing frequent crashes and instability, particularly in games using the Unreal Engine .""Intel is aware of problems that occur when executing certain tasks on 13th and 14th generation core processors for desktop PCs, and is analysing them with major affiliates,"" an Intel spokesperson told ZDNet Korea.The affected CPUs include the Core i9-13900K and Core i9-14900K, with users reporting crashes in popular titles such as Fortnite , Tekken 8, and Hogwarts Legacy. Some gamers have experienced an ""out of video memory"" error, while others have faced sudden game exits or complete system lockups.The issue has become so prevalent that Epic Games , the Fortnite and the Unreal Engine developer developer, has published a support notice advising affected users to adjust their BIOS settings to mitigate the crashes. The suggested workarounds involve manually downclocking or undervolting the Intel processors , leading to concerns about these high-end CPUs' stability and performance.In South Korea , the problem has escalated to the point where PC retailers are reporting a significant increase in CPU returns and exchanges. ""The number of consumers visiting the customer center asking to change their 13th and 14th generation core processors has recently increased to more than ten per day,"" stated one company official.The exact cause of the crashes remains unclear, but the widespread nature of the reports has prompted Intel to launch an investigation in collaboration with major affiliates. The company has not yet provided a timeline for the investigation or any potential fixes.The game crashes have raised questions about whether Intel has pushed the clock speeds of its latest CPUs too far, sacrificing stability for performance. Some users have even accused the company of selling unstable processors. The issue has also highlighted the importance of thorough testing and validation before releasing new hardware to the market.Intel is currently investigating the root cause of system crashes that are affecting some of its users. Unfortunately, there are limited options available for affected users to maintain system stability. While downclocking or undervolting the CPUs may provide temporary solution, many gamers are frustrated by the need to compromise on performance to ensure a crash-free experience.","Intel is looking into reports of stability issues and game crashes affecting its high-end 13th and 14th generation Core i9 processors.

A captivating romance can uplift anyone's spirits, and anime has a unique ability to vividly portray these narratives. Over the years, Japanese animation has delivered numerous romantic tales, ranging from light-hearted comedies to deeply emotional dramas.For romance enthusiasts, navigating through the vast array of anime options can be overwhelming.However, there are several exceptional romance anime series that truly shine above the rest. Here is a curated list of top romance anime series , compiled by Game Rant, along with their respective rankings.Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie stirred mixed reactions upon its debut in Spring 2022, often compared to ""My Dress-Up Darling"" but standing out as a unique slice-of-life anime centred around a charming couple, Shikimori and Yuu Izumi.One distinctive aspect of the series is its portrayal of the main couple already in a relationship, a rarity in anime. While the episodes focus on everyday moments, they paint a wholesome picture of young love with two endearing characters navigating the nuances of romance.Describing Bakemonogatari as a straightforward romance might be a stretch, but this instalment of Monogatari indeed focuses on and highlights the relationship between Koyomi Araragi and Hitagi Senjougahara. Their initial interactions are unconventional, involving a stapler to the face, but Araragi's determination to assist Senjougahara with her curse ultimately brings them closer.Despite the surreal and eccentric nature of Monogatari, the romance between Araragi and Senjougahara is remarkably grounded and healthy. While the series introduces other potential romantic interests, their relationship remains steadfast and central to the narrative.""Sing 'Yesterday' for Me"" presents romance in a refreshingly realistic manner compared to many other anime. The series takes a classic love triangle and steers it in an unexpected direction by the end, resulting in a highly satisfying conclusion that portrays how failed romances can evolve into strong friendships.Directed by Yoshiyuki Fujiwara, known for his work on popular anime like ""Attack on Titan"" and ""Sword Art Online,"" the shift to a show with such a different tone demonstrates his versatility and mastery in storytelling across diverse genres.""My Happy Marriage"" emerged as one of the standout romance anime of Summer 2023, adapted from Akumi Agitogi's novel series. Set in an alternate Meiji Restoration era with supernatural elements, the story follows Miyo, who endures mistreatment from her stepfamily despite her privileged background. Her family arranges her marriage to a notorious military figure known for rejecting wives quickly, with rejection spelling disaster for Miyo. However, Kiyoka surprises everyone by taking an interest in Miyo and becoming incensed by her family's cruelty.The anime delves into the lasting impact of Miyo's abuse, highlighting her struggle to regain self-worth, even with Kiyoka's support. Kiyoka himself is a complex character with hidden motives behind his initial attraction to Miyo, although his feelings for her are genuine.While the romance between Miyo and Kiyoka is heartwarming, ""My Happy Marriage"" falls short in other areas. The supernatural elements can seem disjointed, and the villains are one-dimensional despite being detestable.Based on Fumita Yanagida's popular and finished manga, ""Tomo-chan Is a Girl!"" stood out as one of Winter 2023's most amusing romantic comedies. Tomo and Jun share a close friendship, but Jun sees Tomo strictly as a friend, unaware of her romantic feelings.While romance is central to its characters, ""Tomo-chan Is a Girl!"" leans heavily into comedy. Tomo and Jun's dynamic is charming, and they're supported by entertaining characters like Misuzu and Carol. Despite its comedic tone, the chemistry between Tomo and Jun develops convincingly over the season. Unlike some romance anime, Tomo-chan excels in portraying why its leads are compatible without difficulty.Teen romance anime often dominate the genre, but there are exceptions worth noting. ""Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku"" is primarily a workplace comedy that revolves around two couples: the newly formed pair of Hirotaka Nifuji and Narumi Momose, and the more established couple, Tarou Kabakura and Hanako Koyanagi. The focus remains on Hirotaka and Narumi, with the series emphasising humour over romance, but Tarou and Hanako's relationship is depicted realistically.Despite being childhood friends, Narumi struggles to see Hirotaka as a potential romantic interest, a dynamic that persists throughout the series. The anime's brevity limits the depth of these relationships, but ""Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku"" provides an entertaining journey within its runtime.""Romantic Killer"" cleverly parodies romance and harem anime while paying homage to their core strengths. Anzu, a girl with no interest in boys, is suddenly thrust into a reverse harem scenario by a magical being, disrupting her life of gaming and chocolate consumption. Unamused by her newfound romantic entanglements with unfamiliar guys, Anzu navigates this unconventional situation with scepticism.Primarily a comedy, ""Romantic Killer"" aims to elicit laughter from its audience, often succeeding with its humour rooted in its origins as a shonen manga, characterised by exaggerated facial expressions.Though not always aiming for emotional depth, the anime treats its characters and their relationships seriously. Anzu shines as a compelling lead, and the male characters introduced as potential partners are well-developed. ""Romantic Killer"" offers a delightful blend of humour and romance for those seeking an entertaining and unconventional love story.""The Angel Next Door Spoils Me Rotten"" captivates viewers from the start for several reasons. Firstly, Project No.9's animation is impressive, featuring clean and detailed character designs. Secondly, and most importantly, the main characters exhibit instant chemistry, evident when Amane offers his umbrella to a soaked Mahiru, sparking a connection.Throughout the series, despite the frequent presence of both leads on screen, ""The Angel Next Door Spoils Me Rotten"" effectively delves into their individual personalities while also developing their friendship.Rumiko Takahashi is celebrated as a legendary mangaka, known for classics like Inuyasha, Ranma 1/2, and Urusei Yatsura. While most of her renowned works fall within the shonen genre, Takahashi has also ventured into seinen storytelling. Maison Ikkoku stands out as one of her most mature works, emphasising romance as its primary theme.Unlike Takahashi's prominent shonen series that explore various genres such as comedy and action alongside romance, Maison Ikkoku focuses squarely on romantic elements, enriched with drama, character development, and humour.The central relationship features Kyouko and Yuusaku, both drawn to each other but hindered by their circumstances. Kyouko, grieving the recent loss of her husband, is hesitant to move forward. Meanwhile, Yuusaku, deeply in love with Kyouko, doubts his worthiness as a student. The anime chronicles their journeys of growth, healing, and mutual misunderstanding, complemented by well-developed secondary characters.Insomniacs After School emerged as the standout romance of Spring 2023, adapted from Makoto Ojiro's esteemed seinen manga. The story revolves around two students plagued by insomnia, a burden they carried alone until they met at their school's observatory. Isaki and Ganta form an immediate bond, which deepens as they work together to revive the Astronomy Club, driven by their shared need to preserve their newfound sanctuary.The anime boasts impeccable pacing, skillfully depicting the protagonists' isolation due to insomnia and the subtle solace they find in each other. While romance is a central theme, the series prioritises developing Ganta and Isaki's friendship before advancing their relationship, emphasising the depth of their connection beyond shared circumstances.Kokoro Connect injects a supernatural twist into a classic love triangle scenario. The story centers around Taichi, Iori, Yui, Yoshifumi, and Himeko, students of the Student Cultural Research Club, whose lives take a turn when they receive supernatural abilities from a mysterious being named Heartseed.As they grapple with these newfound powers, the group experiences sensory phenomena that challenge their relationships and reveal hidden aspects of their personalities. The anime is rich in character development, providing an engaging and thought-provoking experience.Maid Sama! carries many tropes that might derail other romance anime: an overly perfect male lead, a strong female protagonist reduced to a damsel, and an unnecessary love triangle. Despite these shortcomings, Maid Sama! shines through its strong personality.The heart of Maid Sama! lies in the relationship between Takumi Usui, a charming heartthrob, and Misaki Ayuzawa, a strict student council president with a busy schedule balancing school, home, and work. When Takumi discovers Misaki's secret job at a maid cafe, it opens a new perspective on the usually composed president.In ""Rascal Does Not Dream Of Bunny Girl Senpai,"" romance plays a subtle yet compelling role that defines the series. The story centers on Sakuta Azusagawa, a high school student drawn to girls suffering from Adolescence Syndrome, a condition linked to their insecurities.While the anime unfolds through different arcs focusing on various girls, the standout is the initial saga featuring Mai Sakurajima, an actress who forms a close bond with Sakuta. Their dynamic crackles with romantic tension, warmth, and clever banter. Although not always in the foreground, their relationship develops steadily across subsequent arcs, leading to a satisfying sequel in the form of a feature film.Wakana Gojou and Marin Kitagawa inhabit completely contrasting worlds. Gojou, isolated and reserved, keeps himself apart from others due to his passion for hina dolls, fearing ridicule. In contrast, Kitagawa is popular, outgoing, and self-assured.Despite their differences, Kitagawa becomes intrigued by cosplay and sees Gojou as the ideal person to create outfits for her. ""My Dress-Up Darling"" is a charming, humorous, and beautifully animated romance anime that excels in executing classic genre tropes with finesse.""Toradora!"" is a beloved slice-of-life romantic comedy that offers a wonderful entry point into the genre. The story revolves around Ryuji Yusaku and Taiga Aisaka, two students who have crushes on each other's best friends.Both Ryuji and Taiga are viewed as outcasts—Ryuji due to his intimidating appearance and Taiga because of her fiery temper. They team up to assist each other in their romantic pursuits. The series delves into their evolving dynamic and the humorous mishaps that ensue as they navigate their intertwined love lives.""The Pet Girl of Sakurasou"" depicts the journey of an eccentric group of characters as they navigate growth and self-discovery. Sorata Kanda is forced to move into the unconventional Sakura House after being kicked out of his school's main dorms.In Sakura House, Sorata encounters talented yet troubled students. When a peculiar young artist joins the dorm, Sorata takes on the responsibility of helping her adjust to her new life. The series delves into the interactions among the dorm mates, their personal aspirations, and the interconnected nature of their relationships.""Ouran High School Host Club"" is a delightful reverse harem anime filled with lighthearted and meaningful moments. Haruhi Fujioka accidentally breaks an antique vase belonging to her school's Host Club and must repay her debt by disguising herself as a boy and working as a host.The series excels in developing Haruhi's character along with her fellow hosts, providing insight into their motivations and personalities. It's a must-watch for shojo fans, featuring a memorable cast of characters that carries the show through its run.Kyoto Animation has produced many beloved anime, and ""Love, Chunibyo & Other Delusions!"" is among them. The series centers around a phenomenon known as Chunibyo, where adolescents have grandiose and unrealistic delusions.Yuta Togashi, who has outgrown his delusional phase, aims for a normal high school life. However, things take a turn when his classmate, Rikka Takanashi, reminds him of his past and tries to pull him back into the world of Chunibyo with her own delusions. The series delves into their relationship as Yuta unravels the triggers behind Rikka's delusions.The trope of opposites attracting may be overused, but when done well, it can lead to a captivating romantic comedy. ""Kimi ni Todoke"" explores the endearing friendship between the shy Sawako Kuronuma and the popular Shouta Kazehaya. Sawako, often mistaken for Sadako from ""The Ring,"" is isolated at school due to her appearance, making it challenging for her to break out of her shell. Fortunately, Kazehaya is just the right person to help her.""Kimi ni Todoke"" is a delightful and heartwarming anime with well-developed characters who evolve as the story unfolds. While it adheres to typical romance anime pacing, the journey remains engaging and enjoyable.Unlike most romance stories that focus on the process of falling in love, ""Tonikawa: Over The Moon For You"" follows a married couple who have already reached that point. As a result, the anime adopts a slice-of-life approach, showcasing Nasa and Tsukasa's daily life and antics rather than a typical romantic journey. ""Tonikawa"" doesn't rely on dramatic highs but instead offers a pleasant and light-hearted experience.While this anime may not appeal to everyone, it serves as a refreshing departure from more melodramatic romance shows. Despite their tendency to blush at the slightest physical contact, Nasa and Tsukasa are refreshingly direct in expressing their feelings, making them both witty and likeable characters.This romantic anime shines because of its main character, Takeo Gouda. His towering, imposing presence contrasts beautifully with his heartfelt affection for the delicate Rinko, which is truly heartwarming. Takeo's efforts to play matchmaker for Rinko with his best friend, despite his own feelings, demonstrate his genuine kindness.Viewers will undoubtedly root for Takeo and Rinko's endearing relationship. ""My Love Story!!"" delivers the goods without delay, as the main characters are dating for most of the episodes, bypassing the typical slow build-up to a confession.""A Sign of Affection"" is a heartwarming romantic comedy centred on college-age love and the challenges of communication. While not the sole focus of the story, Yuki and Itsuomi stand out as the main couple, instantly captivating viewers. Yuki, who is hearing-impaired, communicates using sign language, text, and by reading lips, while Itsuomi is a world traveller passionate about learning languages. Their connection begins on a train and grows stronger with each subsequent encounter.The anime beautifully captures the intense emotions of falling in love, highlighted by a poignant moment in the opening episode. With an older cast, ""A Sign of Affection"" takes on a more mature tone compared to typical romance anime. Throughout the season, Yuki and Itsuomi become increasingly comfortable around each other, resulting in consistently endearing interactions.This romantic anime is ideal for LGBTQ+ viewers seeking representation on screen, but its well-crafted storytelling makes it enjoyable for all audiences. The heartwarming romance blossoms between Mafuyu and Ritsuka as Mafuyu learns to play guitar and sing in Ritsuka's band.Watching Mafuyu's growing confidence alongside the romantic tension creates a compelling series that's hard to resist. The accompanying movie is also outstanding and a must-watch continuation of the series.Nana is one of the most renowned and beloved shoujo anime of all time, a must-watch for fans of romance and beyond. The series follows two women named Nana, seemingly different but navigating curiously similar life situations that lead to separate outcomes.Without giving away how their stories intertwine, Nana's 47 episodes delve into the protagonists' perspectives on love through various relationships. Grounded in reality, the anime explores complex characters who, despite occasional extremes, face accountability for their actions.Your Lie in April, one of the most famous romance anime, revolves around two music prodigies: Kousei Arima and Kaori Miyazono. Kousei, grappling with depression after his mother's death, loses his passion for the piano and withdraws from the performance arts. One day, he hears Kaori playing her violin with such freedom that it reignites his love for music and sparks his admiration for her.The anime delves into themes of grief, life, love, and music. Kousei's journey toward self-healing is profound, marked by heartbreak, but also punctuated by moments of beauty, tenderness, and joy.In this anime, Miyuki and Kaguya engage in a battle of wits to avoid confessing their love first, using their intellect and skills to outmaneuver each other. Both are determined not to be seen as the one who gives in.Their antics running the student council at an elite school with their friends are uproariously funny yet also contain heartwarming moments that will make viewers cheer. Season 3 of Kaguya-sama: Love is War, which aired in Spring 2022, leaned heavily into comedy but also devoted more time to developing Miyuki and Kaguya's relationship and touching on other romances.If the anime follows the manga, the next season of Love is War promises to be predominantly romantic. If successful, this upcoming release could elevate Kaguya-sama to the pinnacle of romance anime.This anime consists of two parts: Clannad and After Story. The latter surpasses the former by a wide margin, but watching Clannad is essential to fully appreciate the impact of After Story. While it features a diverse cast of supporting characters, the heart of the show revolves around Tomoya Okazaki and Nagisa Furukawa, delivering a profound narrative.Unlike typical romance series, Clannad After Story unfolds beyond high school, depicting the growth of Tomoya and Nagisa as individuals and as a couple. The anime tackles real-life challenges without glossing over them, offering a genuine exploration of common struggles.The Dangers in My Heart is truly brilliant. At first glance, it may seem like another typical shounen romance where a popular girl falls for an ordinary loner guy. These stories often offer little beyond wish fulfilment, and The Dangers in My Heart initially appears to fit that mould. Yet, the anime stands out.Ichikawa is an average guy with few friends who daydreams about unusual things. While the anime doesn't delve deeply into these thoughts, it doesn't ignore them either, leaving Ichikawa with a poor first impression. On the other hand, Anna is a cheerful but shy girl who loves food and works as a model. After a chance encounter at the school library, the two start spending time together, developing a friendship that hints at something deeper. Anna encourages Ichikawa to break out of his shell, leading to significant changes in him over the course of two seasons.Although slow-paced initially, The Dangers in My Heart evolves into something special by the end of season 1, maintaining its momentum in the subsequent cour and establishing itself as one of the best romance anime of all time. Anna and Ichikawa are both exceptional characters, but Anna's depth is what elevates the show. She's not just an idealised plot device; she's a fully realised character with insecurities, quirks, and vulnerabilities. Her interest in Ichikawa feels genuine, and vice versa. This is a rare quality in romance anime.Fruits Basket is the definitive romance anime, masterfully blending drama and comedy. Tooru Honda, a lovable protagonist, faces life's challenges until she moves in with the Souma family. The Soumas, particularly Yuki, are school idols hiding a shocking secret that alters perceptions.Love triangles often lack depth, favouring one partner over the other. Fruits Basket defies this norm with its compelling love triangle, where each character is fully developed. Across three seasons, Fruits Basket takes viewers on an unforgettable journey.Also read | GTA 5 cheat codes: List of Grand Theft Auto 5 cheat codes for PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox consoles","Japanese animation has delivered numerous romantic tales, ranging from light- hearted comedies to deeply emotional dramas.

Clock Tower Vantage Point

Los Santos Airport Bunker

Hidden Mine

Large Hotel Swimming Pool

Secret Cave Bunker

The enduring popularity of Grand Theft Auto 5 has drawn millions of players into its immersive world, yet many have not fully explored all of its secret locations. This isn't surprising given the vast scope of the game, which offers a sprawling open-world map for players to freely explore. With hundreds of diverse areas and locales to discover, it's easy to become absorbed in the thrilling adventures of San Andreas.The most elusive and lesser-known locations scattered throughout the map can be challenging to uncover without keen observation.These hidden spots range from small yet useful areas providing shelter from adversaries to eerie, mysterious locations shrouded in unanswered questions. Whether searching for secrets with friends in GTA Online or embarking on a solo quest in the single-player campaign, players seeking the best GTA 5 secret locations have much to anticipate. It's also a great way to pass the time until the release of GTA 6, which promises to introduce new secret locations in Vice City and Leonida.Located on the western side of Los Santos, the Clock Tower presents players with a distinctive vantage point that overlooks the entire city. Accessible by air transport, players can ascend ladders to reach the highest level, offering a 360-degree view ideal for strategic shooting and cover against airborne vehicles. The operational clock adds a realistic element to the gameplay, enriching the immersive world of GTA 5.This concealed bunker at Los Santos airport offers players a secluded hideout to evade authorities or lay low. Accessed through a roof hatch or rear doors, the bunker features interactive elements such as vending machines and a water cooler. Despite being labelled ""Authorised Personnel Only,"" it provides an intriguing space that suggests potential narrative integration, adding to the allure of exploration.Situated in the mountainous area of the map, the hidden mine tunnel offers a vast and enigmatic environment. Players can access it by detonating wooden doors, revealing a network of tunnels that lead in various directions. Encountering a deceased body initiates the ""Murder Mystery"" side mission, enriching the exploration by unlocking game enhancements such as camera filters.Hidden within a prominent Los Santos hotel, the expansive swimming pool serves as an unexpected oasis for players to appreciate. Accessible through the hotel's interior, the area boasts elegant design features and palm trees, offering a scenic setting for shooting scenarios in GTA Online. Its visibility from above enhances its appeal as a concealed treasure within the city.Situated on a remote island in the Pacific Ocean, this concealed bunker provides a secluded underground facility protected by mercenaries and FBI agents.
