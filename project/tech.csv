EY employee's death: Anna Sebastian's father appeals to the company,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ey-employees-death-anna-sebastians-father-appeals-to-the-company/articleshow/113534810.cms,"Made appeal to EY

Family not planning to take EY to court

What Anna's mother wrote in the letter

Sibi Joseph, father of Anna Sebastian Perayil , the 26-year-old EY employee who died due to 'work-related stress' recently broke his silence. In an interview to news agency IANS, he said that said that his daughter was ""hardly getting any sleep and was unable to eat proper food"". Joseph said that his daughter, who was involved in an audit of Bajaj Auto, would often work past midnight and return to her paying guest accommodation around 1.30 am.Anna's death has created an uproar, triggered by the letter written by her mother, Anita Augustine, to EY chairman Rajiv Memani that went viral on social media. In the letter, Augustine voiced her concerns regarding the excessive workload placed on her daughter, a newcomer to the company, and indicated that Anna ultimately succumbed to work-related stress. Anna had joined the company in March, after completing CA, and passed away on July 20.Joseph said that recently, four officials of Ernst and Young (EY) visited their home in Kangarapady, Kochi. In the meeting, Sebastian's parents made an appeal to the company to terminate the employees who were responsible for their daughter's untimely demise. Joseph said, ""Four EY officials had come here, and we reiterated our concerns to them.""Joseph, however, said that the family has no intention of pursuing legal action against the company. He clarified that the letter's purpose was to raise awareness among the company's top executives to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.How Anna's mother's letter sent in July got leaked in SeptemberAnna's mother had sent a letter to EY chairman in July, just days after her death. The letter, meant as a private correspondence, was leaked from EY’s Pune office. The reason of the leak Anna’s father believes is that others within the company may be facing similar work-related stress and want the issue to be brought to public attention. ""The letter was leaked from EY's Pune office, which means there are many people similarly suffering in the company who want the letter to be out in public,"" Joseph said.Anna Sebastian Perayil, who passed her CA exams in 2023, worked at EY Pune office for four months before she succumbed. Anna's mother wrote an emotional letter to the EY Chairman alleging that her daughter's demanding work schedule contributed to her death. She expressed concerns over the intense workload placed on her daughter, a newcomer to the company, highlighting the toll of working long hours without breaks, including on Sundays. This case has raised questions about employee welfare and the pressures faced by young professionals.In the letter, the mother said ""“Burdening newcomers with such backbreaking work, making them work day and night, even on Sundays, has no justification whatsoever. She had just left her hometown and loved ones. Everything was new to her—the organization, the place, the language—and she was trying very hard to adjust. You should show some consideration to new employees. Instead, the management took full advantage of the fact that she was new and overwhelmed her with both assigned and unassigned work.”“Anna was always a fighter, from childhood through her academic years, where she excelled in everything she did. She was a school topper, and a college topper, excelled in extracurricular activities, and passed her CA exams with distinction. She worked tirelessly at EY, giving her all to meet the demands placed on her,” the mother said in the letter further.","Anna Sebastian Perayil, 26, died due to 'work-related stress' on July 20.

What are IT Amendment Rules, 2023

In a significant ruling, the Bombay High Court on Friday (September 20) declared the amended Information Technology (IT) Rules unconstitutional and struck them down. These rules aimed to identify and control fake content on social media about the government.The case was brought before Justice Chandurkar due to differing opinions within the previous division bench.While Justice Patel had previously struck down the rules, citing concerns about censorship, Justice Gokhale upheld them, claiming no adverse impact on free speech. Justice Chandurkar ultimately sided with Justice Patel's view.Justice A S Chandurkar , who was appointed as a ‘tie-breaker judge’ after a division bench provided a split verdict earlier this year, concluded that the rules violated Articles 14, 19, and 19(1)(g) of the Constitution, concerning equality, freedom of speech and profession, respectively.“I have considered the matter extensively. The impugned rules are violative of Article 14 (right to equality), 19 (freedom of speech and expression) and 19(1)(g) (freedom and right to profession) of the Constitution of India ,” the judge said.Justice Chandurkar specifically criticised the vagueness of the terms in the rules, saying that the expression “fake, false and misleading” in the Rules was “vague and hence wrong” in the absence of any definition.In April 2023, the government introduced in the IT Amendment Rules, 2023, changes to the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 that will allow the government to establish Fact-Check Units (FCUs) that will be tasked to identify and flag potentially false or misleading content related to its work on the social media platforms.According to these rules, if the FCU identifies any posts containing fake, false, or misleading information about the government's activities, it will report these posts to social media platforms. The platform then has two choices: remove the post or add a disclaimer. If they choose to add a disclaimer, they lose their legal protection and could face legal consequences.","The Bombay High Court on Friday (September 20) declared the amended Information Technology (IT) Rules unconstitutional.

EU warns Apple to open up iOS to rivals or face fines,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/eu-warns-apple-to-open-up-ios-to-rivals-or-face-fines/articleshow/113528056.cms,"The European Union has issued a warning to Apple, demanding the tech giant open its iPhone and iPad operating systems to rival technologies or risk significant fines under new antitrust rules . The EU 's competition watchdog announced that Apple must comply with the Digital Markets Act (DMA) within six months or face potential penalties.EU competition chief Margrethe Vestager announced that the commission is using specification proceedings for the first time under the DMA to guide Apple towards effective compliance.The move aims to compel Apple to re-engineer its services, allowing rival companies access to the iOS and iPadOS ecosystems.The proceedings target two main areas: iOS connectivity features for devices like smartwatches, headphones, and virtual reality headsets, and Apple's process for addressing developers' requests for third-party interoperability with iOS and iPadOS.The commission aims to specify how Apple should provide effective interoperability, allowing non-Apple devices to easily pair and connect with iPhones and receive notifications. This move is designed to ensure fair and open digital markets, with a focus on smartphone operating systems playing a crucial role.Apple responded by saying it has created ways for developers to request additional interoperability while protecting user security. The company warned that undermining built-in protections could put European consumers at risk.""Undermining the protections we've built over time would put European consumers at risk, giving bad actors more ways to access their devices and data,"" Apple said in the statement to Reuters.This action follows a preliminary finding in June that Apple had breached DMA rules by not allowing App Store developers to freely inform users about alternative payment options outside its ecosystem.Apple has already made several changes to comply with the DMA, including opening up iOS and iPadOS to third-party app stores and allowing developers access to its NFC technology.If Apple fails to comply, the EU may launch a formal probe that could lead to fines of up to 10% of the company's global annual sales.

Picture abhi baaki hai (The story isn't over yet)

Today, I celebrate 2 years of being in IndiGo (

InterGlobe Aviation

Ltd) and India. On our 18th IndiGo birthday last month, we celebrated many wonderful milestones and unveiled our ambitious plans for coming years. Our story has just started. I am grateful and proud to be a part of this incredible IndiGo journey with my colleagues - giving wings to the nation with over 2,000 daily flights, 430+ domestic and 100+ international routes, and growing every day.

When I had joined, I had shared the quote, ""Wherever you go, becomes a part of you somehow”. Being a part of IndiGo and now living now in India for two years....IndiGo and this beautiful country India have indeed become a part of me. Bharat ab ghar jaisa lagta hai.

India's essence is captured in its beautiful diversity. Of our 88 domestic cities, I had the pleasure of visiting our great teams in 30. From Thiruvananthapuram in the south to Leh in the north. My most recent visit was to Leh, where walking with my son at 18,000 feet at the Khardung La Pass was very special considering my roots are from a country where the highest ""hill"" is some 300 metres only and around 25% of the land is below sea level 😊

Here are some pictures from my travels in the last two years. Can you guess the cities?

Shark Tank judge Anupam Mittal has responded to Indigo CEO Pieter Elbers ’ post celebrating two years of being in India and Indigo. In a LinkedIn post , Elbers wrote “Being a part of IndiGo and now living now in India for two years....IndiGo and this beautiful country India have indeed become a part of me. Bharat ab ghar jaisa lagta hai.” In the post, he also shared photos from his travels to different cities of the country.For those unaware, Pieter Elbers joined Indigo in September 2022.Prior to joining IndiGo, he was the President & Chief Executive Officer of KLM for 8 years. He started his career at KLM in 1992 as Manager Aircraft loading.Mittal replied to the post saying “Aap bhi ab ghar wale jaise lagte ho”. He further added “Good to see u have taken to India”.Take a look at the post here"," Indigo CEO Pieter Elbers celebrated two years of being in India and Indigo.

What Star Health has to say

A massive hacking at one of India's largest health insurers, Star Health , has exposed the private details of over 31 million customers. The stolen data, including sensitive medical reports , has been made publicly accessible through chatbots on the messaging app Telegram .According to a report by news agency Reuters, the data of the insurer’s customers is available for free via chatbots on Telegram – the founder of which was recently arrested for allegedly allowing the platform to be used for criminal activities.According to the report, a user named “xenZen” has created chatbots that allow users to request and download various documents, including policy details, claims information, and even medical diagnoses. Reuters says that it was able to download more than 1,500 files that have names, phone numbers, addresses, tax details, copies of ID cards, test results and medical diagnoses of customers.It also claims that some documents are dated as recently as July 2024. UK-based security researcher Jason Parker told the news agency that he posed as a potential buyer on an online hacker forum where a user under the alias xenZen said they made the chatbots and possessed 7.24 terabytes of data.“If this bot gets taken down watch out and another one will be made available in few hours,” a message read.While Telegram has taken down the initial chatbots after being alerted by Reuters, new ones have reportedly appeared offering Star Health data. The chatbots were marked ""SCAM"" with a stock warning that users had reported them as suspect.“The sharing of private information on Telegram is expressly forbidden and is removed whenever it is found. Moderators use a combination of proactive monitoring, AI tools and user reports to remove millions of pieces of harmful content each day,” said Telegram spokesperson Remi Vaughn said.The company has acknowledged the breach and is working with law enforcement to address the issue. It said an initial assessment showed “no widespread compromise” and that “sensitive customer data remains secure”.“The unauthorised acquisition and dissemination of customer data is illegal, and we are actively working with law enforcement to address this criminal activity. Star Health assures its customers and partners that their privacy is of paramount importance to us,” it said in its statement.","Star Health, one of India's largest health insurers, has exposed the private details of over 31 million customers.

All the previous videos of the Supreme Court hearings were made private post this.This is not the first time that a YouTube channel has been hacked and showing cryptocurrency videos by the same company – Ripple Labs. Several reports claim that scammers have created official-sounding accounts for Ripple and its CEO Brad Garlinghouse. Some of the accounts were reportedly stolen from successful YouTubers who had their accounts hacked, which means that the scammers got hundreds of thousands of subscribers.In 2020, the cryptocurrency company sued YouTube for its “inexplicable failure” at stopping scammers from impersonating its CEO Brad Garlinghouse. The company accused the video platform of selling ads and verifying accounts that promote fake cryptocurrency giveaways. It also alleged that it has been ignoring complaints about the impersonation complaints.Ripple said that it filed the suit to “prompt an industry wide-behaviour change and set the expectation of accountability.”Last month, Ripple Labs was ordered by a Manhattan court judge to pay the US Securities and Exchange Commission about $125 million in penalties over charges of improperly selling the cryptocurrency XRP.",The YouTube channel of the Supreme Court of India was hacked today (September 20) The channel of India’s apex court showed videos related to cryptocurrency developed by a US-based company called Ripple Labs.

Tips to stay safe from WhatsApp video call scam

A Bengaluru man has fallen victim to a sophisticated online scam, losing Rs 59 lakh. The scammers, who spoke fluent English, staged a fake court trial to convince the victim that he was involved in a legal dispute and required a hefty payment to settle the matter.KJ Rao, a Bengaluru resident revealed that he received an automated call on September 11, threatening to block his mobile numbers.Subsequently, he was connected to a person posing as a crime branch officer from Colaba, Mumbai, who falsely accused him of money laundering .After this, Rao received a WhatsApp video call from a person, who was dressed as a police officer. The fake officer claimed that Rao's Aadhaar details had been misused, reinforcing the belief that he was indeed involved in illegal activities. Despite Rao's willingness to report to the local police, he was instructed to stay put.The fraudsters then claimed to transfer the call to a CBI office, where Rao was informed that he was under digital arrest . Following the instructions of the scammer, KJ Rao confined himself to his room and was subjected to constant surveillance via a Skype call.KJ Rao was subsequently connected to a fabricated courtroom setting, where a person impersonating a judge presided over a false trial. The victim was falsely accused of various charges and instructed to transfer a substantial sum of Rs 59 lakh to multiple accounts, allegedly in compliance with a ""court order"" and Reserve Bank of India guidelines.""The crooks didn't let me sleep the whole night as they kept a watch over Skype. My mind just went blank and I didn't have a friend or family member to share my plight with,"" Rao told TOI.The next day, he transferred Rs 50 lakh and Rs 9 lakh to two different bank accounts.The scammers abruptly ended the Skype call around 2:30 PM on September 13th, shortly after KJ Rao had completed the fraudulent money transfers. It was at this point that the victim realised he had been duped and immediately went to the Indiranagar police station to file a complaint.* If you receive a video call from an unknown or unexpected number, be cautious and do not answer immediately. Verify the caller's identity through other means before accepting the call.* Use alternative methods to confirm the caller's identity, such as calling them back on a known number or checking their social media profiles.* Never share personal information, including your financial details, passwords, or identification documents, with anyone you meet online, even if they appear to be legitimate.* Scammers often create a sense of urgency to pressure victims into making hasty decisions. If someone asks you to make a quick payment or transfer money, be cautious and verify the request.* If you believe you have been targeted by a scammer, report the incident to the platform's support team and the relevant authorities.","KJ Rao, a Bengaluru resident revealed that he received an automated call on September 11, threatening to block his mobile numbers.

Meta, Apple not launching AI features in EU

Facebook's parent company Meta , along with other prominent tech players like Spotify and Ericsson , have issued a cautionary message to the European Union (EU). They have said that the EU's current technology regulations may hinder the region from fully reaping the potential advantages of artificial intelligence (AI).The Wall Street Journal reports that in an open letter, executives from more than two dozen companies said AI can boost productivity and expand the economy but Europe might reap fewer rewards than other countries.“Europe has become less competitive and less innovative compared to other regions and it now risks falling further behind in the AI era due to inconsistent regulatory decision making,” the letter said, which included signatories from representatives from German software company SAP and German industrial group Thyssenkrupp, along with researchers and civil-society and trade groups.As per the report, the European Commission – EU’s executive body – said that it is working to support AI innovation, adding that the EU’s incoming justice commissioner is expected to make sure that the bloc’s data protection law responds to both law enforcement and commercial needs.The letter comes soon after Meta and Apple announced that the AI features on their platforms and devices will not be available in Europe because of the bloc’s regulations.Recently, Apple said that its new AI system, called Apple Intelligence, will not be available for European iPhone users this year because of what it said were uncertainties caused by a new digital-competition law.Meanwhile, Meta said in July that it will not release a future multimodal AI model in the EU in the near term because of “the unpredictable nature of the European regulatory environment.”","Facebook's parent company Meta, along with other prominent tech players like Spotify and Ericsson, have issued a cautionary message to the European Union (EU) They have said that the EU's current technology regulations may hinder the region from fully reaping the potential advantages of artificial intelligence.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113501463,imgsize-40192,width-400,resizemode-4/113501463.jpg"

Harris, Trump campaign spokespersons speak

Iranian hackers who stole former US President Donald Trump campaign ’s documents sent excerpts to individuals linked to President Joe Biden's reelection team earlier this summer with an aim to try to influence the 2024 election , law enforcement officials have said.The New York Times reported that the recipients of those documents, however, did not engage.The emails, which were sent in late June and early July, were part of an Iranian effort to steal and distribute sensitive communications from aides working for Trump, the report added.According to the publication, the hackers accessed the email of Roger Stone, a longtime political adviser to Trump.In a joint statement, officials from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the FBI, and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said that “Iranian malicious cyberactors” sent unsolicited emails that included “an excerpt taken from stolen, nonpublic material from former President Trump's campaign.”Federal officials also believe the hackers also targeted the Biden and Harris campaigns but the emails with the stolen Trump material appeared to be intended for his political opponents.Karoline Leavitt, a spokesperson for the Trump campaign, said, “This is further proof the Iranians are actively interfering in the election to help Kamala Harris and Joe Biden because they know President Trump will restore his tough sanctions and stand against their reign of terror.Meanwhile, a spokesperson for the Harris campaign, Morgan Finkelstein, noted that a few people were “targeted on their personal emails with what looked like a spam or phishing attempt”, adding that she was not aware that any material had been sent to campaign accounts.“We have cooperated with the appropriate law enforcement authorities since we were made aware that individuals associated with the then-Biden campaign were among the intended victims of this foreign influence operation,” the spokesperson noted.The Justice Department's national security division is investigating the hack and could bring charges against those responsible as early as this week, the publication cited officials familiar with the matter.","Iranian hackers stole documents from former US President Donald Trump's campaign.

Despite its rapid rise, generative AI is not without its limitations. A recent report by Deutsche Bank Research underscored that while the technology excels in certain areas, it still struggles with tasks like mathematical calculations .While generative AI has proven valuable for tasks such as summarization, translation, and creative content generation, it remains challenged by reasoning, abstract concept learning, and understanding the world.The report emphasized, ""Generative AI is certainly flawed... while it's surprisingly good at some activities, it's surprisingly bad at others, such as making mathematical calculations.""One significant issue is the tendency of generative AI systems to produce hallucinations, or inaccurate information. These systems can also introduce bias or irrelevance into their outputs. Despite ongoing efforts, these problems persist.The report further highlighted that while AI's potential for productivity gains is promising, real-world applications may not always deliver.

Multiple explosions in Lebanon on September 17 and 18, 2024, resulted in the deaths of 12 people and injuries to over 2,700. The attacks, believed to target members of the militant group Hezbollah , involved detonated pagers and walkie-talkies.Israel has neither confirmed nor denied any role in the explosions, however, according to a report in New York Times , 12 current and former defense and intelligence officials who were briefed on the attack say that the Israelis were behind it, describing the operation as complex and long in the making.This incident highlights the vulnerability of supply chains to sabotage. In the past, the U.S. National Security Agency has been known to intercept computer hardware and insert malware or surveillance tools before delivering it to foreign buyers.Hezbollah's increased use of pagers after the Hamas attack on Israel in October 2023 was likely an attempt to evade Israeli surveillance . By shifting to less technologically advanced communication devices, the group hoped to avoid being tracked through their phones.The widespread use of smartphones has made it easier than ever for governments, companies, and individuals to track people's movements. This can be done through network location data, app tracking, and even built-in features like GPS and Bluetooth. While this can be beneficial for purposes like finding missing persons or combating terrorism, it also raises privacy concerns.Hezbollah's leader had reportedly previously warned members to avoid using cell phones, citing the risk of Israeli surveillance. In February this year, Hezbollah chief, Hassan Nasrallah , reportedly told his followers that Israel was using cellphone networks to pinpoint the locations of his operatives. “You ask me where the agent is,” In a publicly televised address, Nasrallah said, “I tell you that the phone in your hands, in your wife’s hands, and in your children’s hands is the agent.” Then he issued a plea. “Bury it,” Mr. Nasrallah said. “Put it in an iron box and lock it.”The New York Times report added that Nasrallah had been pushing for years for Hezbollah to invest instead in pagers, which for all their limited capabilities could receive data without giving away a user’s location or other compromising information.","Multiple explosions in Lebanon on September 17 and 18, 2024, resulted in the deaths of 12 people and injuries to over 2,700.

As COVID-19 restrictions ease, several major companies are reversing remote work policies , urging employees back to the office. As per reports, companies like X, Amazon , Meta , Apple Google , and others have shifted their hybrid work models to emphasise in-person collaboration. These return-to-office (RTO) mandates are driven by the belief that face-to-face interaction fosters stronger teamwork, innovation, and productivity, while also reinforcing company culture.Many leaders argue that physical presence is essential for mentoring, professional development, and spontaneous problem-solving. This overview highlights the companies enforcing RTO policies and their rationale for prioritising in-office work after the pandemic.Amazon has been at the forefront of reversing remote work policies. CEO Andy Jassy announced in a memo that starting January 2, 2024, corporate employees must return to the office full-time. He emphasised the benefits of in-person collaboration and how it strengthens company culture. This announcement follows a previous mandate that required employees to spend at least three days a week in the office. Some employees, however, expressed frustration, labelling the move as “significantly more strict” compared to pre-pandemic times.Apple reintroduced in-person work with a hybrid schedule starting in August 2022. Employees are required to be in the office at least three days a week. CEO Tim Cook emphasised the importance of “in-person collaboration,” despite pushback from some employees who petitioned against the change. The hybrid model remains in effect, even though some staffers argue that exceptional work can be accomplished remotely.BlackRock, the global investment firm, mandated a four-day office workweek. In a memo, executives emphasised the importance of in-person moments for career development, especially during market-moving events. The company also allows employees some flexibility, offering remote work for two weeks annually. The firm operates from its newly leased office space in New York, which spans 1 million square feet across 15 floors.Chipotle introduced a four-day office workweek for corporate employees in the summer of 2022. Previously, employees had been required to work three days in the office. The shift to four days emphasises the company's belief in in-person collaboration for corporate productivity.Citigroup adopted a hybrid work model for many employees, allowing two remote days per week. However, in May 2023, the company mandated that 600 employees return to the office full-time, aligning with the broader trend among financial institutions like HSBC and Barclays. This is a shift from their earlier policy, which allowed more flexibility for remote work.In January 2023, Disney's CEO Bob Iger mandated a return to office for hybrid workers, requiring them to spend four days a week on-site. This policy faced opposition, with over 2,300 employees signing a petition, arguing that the mandate would slow the company’s post-COVID recovery. Despite the pushback, the policy was implemented, as Iger emphasised the need for in-person collaboration.Goldman Sachs was one of the early adopters of a strict RTO policy. As of March 2022, employees were required to return to the office five days a week. Despite some non-compliance a year into the policy, CEO David Solomon reiterated the need for in-office attendance, citing the benefits of in-person collaboration for the financial industry.Google began calling employees back to the office in April 2022, requiring them to work in-person at least three days a week. In 2023, the company tightened its RTO policy by linking office attendance to employee performance reviews. Google now only allows full-time remote work in exceptional cases, signalling a stronger focus on office collaboration.IBM has taken a stringent approach to RTO, particularly for managers. The company mandated that all U.S.-based managers must work from an office or client location three days a week. Additionally, employees must live within 50 miles of an IBM office or client site. Those unable to comply by the deadline were asked to relocate or separate from the company. CEO Arvind Krishna indicated that career advancement could be more challenging for those working remotely.JPMorgan announced in April 2023 that all managing directors must work from the office five days a week. Despite resistance from some employees, CEO Jamie Dimon has been firm on the policy. He noted that while he understands the inconvenience of long commutes, employees must comply with the office return or find employment elsewhere.Meta updated its remote work policies in September 2023, requiring employees to be in the office three days a week. The company further emphasised compliance by tracking daily attendance, with failure to adhere to the mandate possibly resulting in termination. The return-to-office effort has been met with some frustration from employees due to a lack of adequate office space.Redfin, a real estate company, rolled out its return-to-office policy in 2023. Employees living within 20 miles of Redfin’s offices in Seattle, San Francisco, and Frisco are required to work in the office full-time on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Those living further away must visit the office once a quarter.Salesforce has gradually increased office attendance requirements. By October 2023, select employees in sales, engineering, and customer-facing roles are required to be in the office four to five days a week. The company continues to refine its RTO strategy based on employee feedback.Snap, formerly a “remote-first” company, required employees to return to the office four days a week starting in 2023. The company has implemented WiFi tracking to monitor employee compliance with the mandate.Tesla implemented a strict RTO policy in June 2022, requiring employees to work in the office for at least 40 hours a week. CEO Elon Musk made it clear that failure to comply would be interpreted as a resignation. He argued that Tesla's success was due to his presence in the factories, and he expects the same commitment from employees.After acquiring X in 2022, Elon Musk ended the company's remote work policy. Employees were required to work at least 40 hours a week in the office unless given explicit permission to work elsewhere. Those not showing up were deemed to have resigned.Uber required its employees in 35 locations to return to the office at least half the time starting in April 2022. CEO Dara Khosrowshahi linked the decline in remote work with a drop in frequent customers for the ride-hailing company.In addition to layoffs, Walmart required previously remote employees to relocate to central hubs, including its headquarters in Arkansas. Hybrid work schedules are still allowed, but most workers are expected to be in the office regularly.Zoom, a key player during the remote work era, updated its policies in 2022, asking employees living within 50 miles of an office to return part-time. The shift marks the company’s pivot from fully remote work as it adapts to changing business needs.","Major companies like X, Amazon, Meta, Apple Google, and others have shifted their hybrid work models to emphasise in-person collaboration.

Speaking on the ""Acquired"" podcast, Zuckerberg emphasised the stark differences in company cultures and approaches to product development.""I think in a lot of ways we're like the opposite of Apple,"" Zuckerberg stated, contrasting Meta's rapid product release strategy with Apple's more deliberate approach.He argued that Meta's willingness to ship products quickly, even at the risk of initial imperfection, fosters faster learning and improvement.Zuckerberg criticised Apple's meticulous product development cycle, saying, ""If you want to wait until you get praised all the time, you're missing a bunch of the time when you could've learned a bunch of useful stuff and then incorporated that into the next version you're going to ship.""The rivalry extends beyond product competition, encompassing fundamental ideological differences about the future of technology.

Walkie-talkies belonging to the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah detonated on Wednesday, killing at least 14 people and injuring more than 450.
