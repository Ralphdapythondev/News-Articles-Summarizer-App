"Spotify reaffirms work from anywhere policy; HR says ‘work is not a place you come to, it’s something ...’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/spotify-reaffirms-work-from-anywhere-policy-hr-says-work-is-not-a-place-you-come-to-its-something-/articleshow/114102154.cms,"

We find things that make people want to come to office: Berg



New hirings may remain low at Spotify

Spotify 's chief human resources officer, Katarina Berg recently said that work is not a place you come to, it’s something you do, reiterating the company’s work-from-anywhere (WFA) policy. In an interview with Raconteur, Berg said that while she understands why some companies have returned to the office, she is yet to find a reason to enforce a mandate for Spotify’s employees.“We are a business that’s been digital from birth, so why shouldn’t we give our people flexibility and freedom?” she said. “You can’t spend a lot of time hiring grown-ups and then treat them like children,” Berg added.“It is harder and we all struggle to collaborate in a virtual environment,” she said. “But does that mean that we will start forcing people to come into the office as soon as there is a trend for it? No.”“People who work here tend to love music,” Berg said, further adding” “We try to find things that make people want to come into the office rather than forcing them to.”Spotify encourages its employees to meet in person during what it calls ‘core week’. During this time, each team is expected to come together to collaborate and discuss strategy. “By having one week where small teams travel to meet up, we can energise people and still have a low impact on the climate,” Berg said. “It has worked really well.”Spotify has retained its office space, but is reportedly looking to downsize its real estate footprint. Part of this is due to mental-health and wellbeing concerns. “We know what happens when people sit down and you can actually look each other in the eye. It’s different to being on screen,” Berg explained. “Some people like to come into the office and meet people.”Berg emphasised that Spotify’s work from anywhere policy has a positive effect on retention rates too. Attrition rates dropped by 15% following its decision to allow employees to work from anywhere. IThe Stockholm-based company announced 1,500 job cuts last year, reducing its total headcount by 17%. “It wasn’t pleasant to do but it was a business decision,” Berg said. “We wanted to mature and we need to become a great business as well as a great product. We had to say goodbye to people that had done really well for us.”She further stated that although Spotify has not implemented a hiring freeze, recruitment will likely remain in the “lower numbers” in the near future. “Being a people-first organisation doesn’t shield you from macroeconomics,” she added.","Spotify's chief human resources officer, Katarina Berg, said that work is not a place you come to, it's something you do.

Read Anand Mahindra’s tribute here

I am unable to accept the absence of Ratan Tata.

India’s economy

stands on the cusp of a historic leap forward.

And Ratan’s life and work have had much to do with our being in this position.

Hence, his mentorship and guidance at this point in time would have been invaluable.

With him gone, all we can do is to commit to emulating his example. Because he was a businessman for whom financial wealth and success was most useful when it was put to the service of the global community.

Goodbye and Godspeed, Mr. T

You will not be forgotten.

Because Legends never die…

Om Shanti

Ratan Tata passed away at 86","Ratan Tata, Chairman Emeritus of Tata Sons, passed away on Wednesday at the age of 86 in a Mumbai hospital.

What is Comcast doing for impacted users

US telecom giant, Comcast has confirmed that a data breach involving some of its customers' information occurred in February 2024. The company revealed the incident following a recent court filing in Maine.According to the filing, the data breach originated from a ransomware attack targeting Financial Business and Consumer Solutions (FBCS), a debt collection agency previously used by Comcast.Hackers gained unauthorised access to FBCS 's computer network between February 14th and 26th, 2024. During this time, they reportedly downloaded sensitive data and encrypted some of the agency's systems.The compromised data reportedly includes personal information belonging to over 237,000 Comcast customers. This information potentially includes names, addresses, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, Comcast account numbers, and ID numbers used internally by FBCS.While Comcast claims they stopped using FBCS for debt collection in 2020, it appears the breach affects customers who were subscribers around 2021. Initial reports from FBCS allegedly indicated no customer data was compromised, leading to a delay in Comcast notifying affected individuals. It wasn't until July 2024 that the debt collection agency disclosed the data breach to Comcast.Comcast is currently notifying impacted customers and advising them to take steps to protect themselves from potential identity theft. To help mitigate the potential risks associated with the data breach, Comcast is providing affected customers with complimentary identity theft protection services for a period of at least 12 months. This includes membership in CyEx Identity Defense Complete, which offers comprehensive credit monitoring services. Along with this, the company has also asked the users to remain vigilant of frauds and check their account statements.","US telecom giant, Comcast has confirmed that a data breach involving some of its customers' information occurred in February 2024.

In an interview to news agency PTI, Vembu emphasised the need for greater interoperability and urged the government to push for open standards.He drew parallels between email, which operates on open standards, and proprietary messaging services, highlighting the need for similar openness in digital communication.""Messaging platforms should not operate in silos. We need standards that prevent monopolies and ensure a level playing field for all,"" Vembu stated.The Zoho founder praised India's Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) initiatives as a ""shining success story"" and a model for other nations to follow.

REUTERS/Toby Melville

Demis Hassabis , CEO and co-founder of Google DeepMind , has been awarded the 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his pioneering work on AlphaFold , an artificial intelligence system that revolutionised protein structure prediction . Hassabis shares half of the prize with his colleague John Jumper , while David Baker of the University of Washington received the other half for his work on computational protein design.The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences recognized Hassabis and Jumper ""for protein structure prediction,"" highlighting AlphaFold's transformative impact on the field of structural biology. The AI tool has made highly accurate protein structure predictions available to researchers within hours, a process that previously could take years of laboratory work.AlphaFold's ability to predict the 3D structure of proteins from their amino acid sequences has been hailed as a major breakthrough, with potential applications in drug discovery , disease diagnosis, and bioengineering. Since its public release in 2021, AlphaFold has predicted the structures of nearly all known proteins, creating a vast database of over 200 million protein structures.Born in London in 1976, Hassabis has had a remarkable career trajectory. A chess prodigy who became a master at 13, he later graduated from Cambridge University with first-class honours in Computer Science. Hassabis co-founded DeepMind in 2010, which was acquired by Google in 2014 for over $500 million.The Nobel Prize marks another significant achievement for Hassabis, who was knighted in the UK earlier this year for his services to artificial intelligence. This recognition underscores the growing importance of AI in scientific research and its potential to drive breakthroughs across various fields.The prize, which includes a share of 11 million Swedish kronor (approximately $1 million), will be split between Hassabis, Jumper, and Baker.This award follows the Nobel Prize in Physics given to “Godfather of AI,” Geoff Hinton, who built “neural networks,” and also had worked part-time at Google for a decade until 2023, when he left for ethical reasons and so he could speak up.","Demis Hassabis, CEO and co-founder of Google DeepMind, has been awarded the 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.

Screams Before Silence

Sandberg told media that the event marked the start of a new campaign for her: To change the minds of college students.

Shocked by anti-Israel protests

Sheryl Sandberg , the former COO of Meta, has launched a new campaign to raise awareness about the brutality of Hamas 's attack on Israel in October 2023. Her film,, documents the sexual violence that occurred during the attack and aims to counter the growing antisemitism on college campuses in the US.The movie was screened at Columbia University auditorium.According to a report in Bloomberg, Sandberg said that she is bringing her film to more than 100 universities, hoping awareness of the brutality of Hamas, which killed 1,200 people and took another 250 hostage last year, will counter what she sees as extremist protesters who view October 7 as a justified act of resistance against Israel.“Politics are blinding us to something that should be completely obvious, which is that rape is never resistance and Hamas is a terrorist group,” Sandberg said in an interview ahead of the screening. “The antisemitism that’s happened in the last year has really shocked me. I was not prepared for this.”“The conflict has been fraught for women for all these reasons,” Sandberg said.Sandberg's initiative comes amid a surge in anti-Jewish incidents in the United States, with many Jewish Americans experiencing harassment, threats, and violence.

Popular streamer and YouTuber iShowSpeed made waves in the online community as he attempted to break the world record for the most backflips completed in under 24 hours on October 8. The current world record of 1,001 backflips was set by an Austrian man named Nico Scheicher in 2019, who achieved this remarkable mark in just nine-hours.In contrast, iShowSpeed aimed to complete 1,002 backflips in nearly a full day, showcasing his determination.Prior to this, he assured his fans about his preparation, having trained rigorously with sit-ups and push-ups. On his channel, iShowSpeed could do 400 backflips before he had to take a break. This announcement grasped the attention of Guinness World Records , who responded to his announcement with a mix of surprise and encouragement.YouTube streamer Darren “iShowSpeed” Watkins, Jr. made headlines on October 8 as he embarked on a quest to break the world record for the most backflips completed in under 24 hours. The current record of 1,001 backflips was set by Austrian parkour enthusiast Nico Scheicher in 2019. Scheicher achieved this impressive feat in just under nine hours, but iShowSpeed aimed to surpass it by completing 1,002 backflips in nearly 24 hours.The challenge kicked off after iShowSpeed announced his ambitious goal during a livestream on October 7. “I’m about to do something that nobody has done before. We will be beating the world record for most backflips in 24 hours, live on stream,” he declared. He explained that he planned to perform at least 42 backflips each hour to achieve his goal.As the event unfolded, iShowSpeed initially demonstrated remarkable endurance by successfully completing over 400 backflips in succession. However, despite his athleticism and commitment to training—having prepared with sit-ups and push-ups—he faced physical challenges. After his 461st backflip, iShowSpeed couldn’t bring himself to do another, which ultimately hindered his ability to break the record. Watch the full video streamed yesterday here.In addition to the physical demands of the challenge, iShowSpeed encountered potential bureaucratic hurdles in officially setting a new record. According to reports from Dexerto, participants must register with Guinness World Records and sign an agreement before attempting to break a record.It remains unclear if Guinness was aware of iShowSpeed’s undertaking, as the organisation responded to his announcement on X (formerly Twitter) with, “We had no idea this was happening, but you do you, bro.”Overall, iShowSpeed's record attempt has generated significant interest, leaving fans eager to see the outcome and wondering if he will try again in the future.

Man quits on Day 1 after manager calls work-life balance 'Western Behaviour': Shares this resignation letter online,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/man-quits-on-day-1-after-manager-calls-work-life-balance-western-behaviour-shares-this-resignation-letter-online/articleshow/114079245.cms,"Hello Mr.

I hope this message finds you well.

After reflecting on recent events that unfolded on my first day of work, I must convey that our professional alignment does not seem to match. Specifically, I find your approach toward work expectations and personal boundaries seriously concerning.

You have repeatedly made remarks about my activities outside of work hours, which I believe is highly inappropriate and unprofessional. What I choose to do in my personal time-whether it is exercising, spending time with family, sleeping, or READING BOOKS-is my prerogative and should not be subject to criticism.

Ridiculing the concept of work-life balance and calling it a ""fancy term"" and ""western-developed behavior"" for someone of 24 years is dismissive, TOXIC, and uncalled for.

Moreover, your insistence on submitting work within 48 hours, outside of normal working hours, without compensation for overtime, coupled with demands to ""burn the midnight oil"" in a threatening manner is unreasonable, inhumane, and inconsiderate. I must remind you that the company LACKS any policy on overtime pay, even after I asked your HR about it, who reassured me that there would be no need for it, and everyone is expected to work within normal work hours (45 hours a week). Expecting work without fair compensation undermines both legal standards and the respect that every employee deserves.

These remarks and expectations are especially concerning given the increasing national attention on toxic work culture, which has sparked important discussions about employee well-being and workplace ethics. It's disappointing to encounter such behavior in light of these developments.

Lastly, your behavior during our last interaction, particularly scolding me, was unacceptable. I will not tolerate being subjected to such treatment.

Given these points, I believe it would be best for you to find another person who is willing to meet your expectations in the manner you desire. I hope you understand my decision, as I prioritize both professionalism and respect in my work relationships.

If you believe that your conduct in these situations is defensible and humane, I welcome and challenge you to make any slack recordings of our conversations public. Let others judge the professionalism and appropriateness of both your expectations and behavior.

Given these circumstances, I have decided it is best to part ways. I suggest finding someone whose approach aligns with your demands.

Sincerely.

Here’s the full text of his Reddit post

Hey everyone, I wanted to share my today's experience of quitting my job on the very first day and standing up to a toxic boss.

Background

My friends and I co-founded a startup right out of college in September 2022. Our goal was to level the playing field for retail investors by addressing three core problems:

Lack of time

Limited expertise

The grunt work

We aimed to solve these issues with AI and algorithms that could automate data gathering, analysis, and simplify complex financial information. Think of it as an ""Auto/Co-Pilot"" for portfolio management, not just another trading tool. This was before AI became the buzzword it is today.

As a part of our B.Tech CSE program, we were also introduced to finance, investments, and markets through structured courses. In the midst of lockdown having extra time on our hands , our finance professors Encouraged us to invest to learn in the markets and so we did. It was tough for us, as learning about the basics of market fundamentals and tracking them was not easy. We realized that many existing tools speak a financial language that's not familiar to most people, and we felt the need for something simpler.

By the time we graduated, we often wondered how we could manage a full-time job while keeping up with the markets. We couldn’t find a tool that really saved time and simplified things. That’s when we saw an opportunity to create one ourselves.

I worked full-time on product design and operations for our startup while my co-founder balanced a day job to support us financially.

We reached the finals of the Elevate Karnataka Startup Funding Competition, competing against over 800 startups. Although we didn’t secure funding, we understood the government's priority to support ventures in green and clean technologies, even if they aren't always financially viable and they believed we could raise funds externally, because of a good decent college IIITK. Our team included interns, and we shared equity among everyone involved. Unfortunately, due to financial constraints and the departure of key team members for higher studies, the project is currently paused. However, we haven’t given up; we just need more time and financial stability to get things moving again.

With that in mind, I began looking for a job. The interview for this position happened back in August. After completing two lengthy assignments (80+ hours of work, one of which I later found out was directly related to their product), they finally got back to me at the end of September. The offered salary was well below average, but I accepted it because it was a remote position that would allow me to focus on my startup after hours and on weekends.

However, things quickly took a turn for the worse on my first day.

The Incident

At the end of my first day (October 7th), my reporting manager made it clear that he expected unreasonable commitments—work beyond normal hours without any compensation. When I tried to establish boundaries, he mocked me for talking about ""work-life balance,"" calling it a ""fancy term"" and ""western developed nation behavior."" He also ridiculed my desire for time to read and exercise, dismissing it as an excuse.

I understand that startups sometimes require extra hours—I’ve done that myself as a co-founder. But there’s a difference between going the extra mile for your own project out of passion and being coerced into it in a professional setting with an established, profitable company.

Why I Shared This

I’ve seen too many people endure such toxic environments without speaking up, and I want to remind everyone that it’s okay to leave a bad situation, even on day one. Toxic work culture isn’t worth compromising your health and self-respect.

If anyone here can refer me to a UI/UX role (Ill share profiles in the DMs :) ) or provide feedback on my work, I’d greatly appreciate it.

I promise to deliver high-quality work to anyone who gives me the opportunity. Thank you all for taking the time to read this. Stay strong, and remember—your well-being matters.

A product designer’s post on Reddit has sparked debate on work-life balance once again. In the post, the individual narrated how he resigned from his job on the first day as the manager pressured him to “work beyond normal hours without any compensation”. He also stated that the manager dismissed and mocked him for talking about “work-life balance”, calling it a ""fancy term"" and ""western developed nation behavior.""The individual says that he joined the company as an Associate Product Designer with a package of Rs 7 LPA which is “below fair median pay”.Being one of the co-founders of an AI startup, he accepted the offer to support it financially as the job offered “remote setup flexibility”.“At the end of my first day (October 7th), my reporting manager made it clear that he expected unreasonable commitments—work beyond normal hours without any compensation,” he said in the post.“I understand that startups sometimes require extra hours—I’ve done that myself as a co-founder.

Campus hiring numbers rise 2024, but still lag

India's IT sector is reportedly gearing up for a significant increase in campus hiring this fiscal year. According to a report in Economic Times, quoted industry experts, IT campus hiring is expected to surge 20-25% this fiscal, backed by growing demand for talent in AI, cybersecurity, cloud computing, and data analytics.After a slowdown in campus hiring last year due to global economic uncertainties, companies are now prioritizing the recruitment of fresh talent to drive digital transformation initiatives and fill skill gaps.Experts told ET that the hiring of fresh talent is a positive sign for the IT sector, which reduced or paused fresh intakes from campuses last year amid global economic uncertainties and to stabilise their workforces after aggressive hiring during the pandemic.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Infosys, Wipro, HCLTech , and Tech Mahindra are among the top software services firms leading the hiring charge. Wipro has already onboarded 3,000 Next Gen Associates (NGAs) in the first quarter of this fiscal and plans to hire an additional 10,000-12,000 NGAs throughout the year. The company is also exploring off-campus hiring strategies and partnerships with academic institutions.Tech Mahindra is looking to hire around 5,000 people from engineering campuses this year and is also participating in the Prime Minister Internship scheme. TCS has announced plans to hire up to 40,000 freshers, while Infosys is targeting around 20,000 campus recruits.Experts anticipate a 20-25% increase in fresher hiring compared to the previous fiscal year. Companies are placing greater emphasis on fresh talent to reduce their reliance on experienced lateral hires and stay ahead in the competitive market. “We're expecting fresher hiring to grow by 20-25% this year compared to FY24. Last year, hiring slowed due to global economic uncertainties, but 2024-25 is showing signs of recovery,” said Krishna Vij, vice president at TeamLease Digital.However, the overall hiring tally in 2024 is expected to be lower than the peak hirings during the pandemic years due to factors like automation and optimization of workforce. Despite the increase in campus hiring, experts caution that the IT services industry will continue to focus on recruiting individuals with new-age skills to meet the evolving demands of the market.","IT campus hiring is expected to surge 20-25% this fiscal, backed by growing demand for talent in AI, cybersecurity, cloud computing, and data analytics.

Scammers involve fake bank employees, government officials



Calls from fake RBI, home ministry, IMF and NPCI officials

A 65-year-old woman from south Mumbai has been defrauded of Rs 1.3 crore in a sophisticated scam orchestrated through a dating app, a report has said. To dupe the woman, the fraudsters employed a combination of emotional manipulation, fake identities and impersonation of officials from various financial institutions over a period of more than a year.According to a report in TOI, the victim is a homemaker and she encountered the scam in April 2023 while using the dating app.According to the report, the woman met the scammer, who identified himself as Paul Rutherford, an American civil engineer working in the Philippines, on dating app “International Cupid.” After gaining her trust, Rutherford fabricated a story about an accident on his construction site, claiming he needed money to avoid legal trouble and deportation.According to the report, the victim sent him money in the form of bitcoins for a period between April and June 2023. The scam escalated when Rutherford promised to repay the victim. He said that he has sent the woman a parcel containing $2 million.In June 2023, she received a call from a woman claiming to be Priya Sharma, a Delhi airport official, who informed her that the parcel had been confiscated by customs. The woman was then told to make several payments over the following months, supposedly to cover government charges for the parcel's release.The scam didn’t stop here. The fraudsters then expanded the deception by involving impersonators from various financial institutions. In January 2024, a man claiming to be an employee of Bank of America in New Delhi contacted the victim, informing her that the $2 million had been transferred to the bank. He even sent her a fake ATM card with her name on it.According to the report, the victim also received calls from women posing as officials from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), who sent her a letter with forged RBI and Ministry of Home Affairs letterheads. The letter promised that dollars would be converted to Indian rupees and she would receive Rs 17 crore in her bank account.To further dupe her of money, in May 2024, the scammers continued with calls from individuals claiming to be employees of the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), assuring the victim that all the money she had paid would be refunded, but she needed to pay fees to NPCI.A fake banker from a leading private bank also contacted her, demanding “intercity charges” for the supposed refund. By June 2024, the victim had reportedly paid a total of Rs 1.3 crore to the fraudsters.She has filed a police complaint stating that she continues to receive calls demanding more money and that she needs to review her bank records to determine the full extent of her financial losses.","A 65-year-old woman from south Mumbai has been defrauded of Rs 1.3 crore in a sophisticated scam orchestrated through a dating app. The fraudsters employed a combination of emotional manipulation, fake identities and impersonation of officials from various financial institutions.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114070952,imgsize-1296916,width-400,resizemode-4/114070952.jpg"

Google get December 20 as ‘course correction’ deadline

The US Department of Justice (DOJ) indicated late Tuesday (October 8) that it is weighing a potential breakup of Google as a remedy in its ongoing antitrust case against the tech giant. This development comes after federal Judge Amit Mehta ruled in August that Google holds an illegal monopoly in the search market.In a court filing, the DOJ said it is ""considering behavioural and structural remedies that would prevent Google from using products such as Chrome, Play, and Android to advantage Google search and Google search-related products and features — including emerging search access points and features, such as artificial intelligence — over rivals or new entrants.""The proposed remedies could include forcing Google to sell off parts of its business, limiting or prohibiting default agreements with device manufacturers, and requiring the company to provide competitors access to its search index data and AI models .""The remedies necessary to prevent and restrain monopoly maintenance could include contract requirements and prohibitions; non-discrimination product requirements; data and interoperability requirements; and structural requirements,"" the DOJ stated in its filing.The Department of Justice is anticipated to submit a more comprehensive proposal to the court by November 20.Google, which plans to appeal the ruling, criticised the DOJ's recommendations as ""radical."" Lee-Anne Mulholland, Google's Vice President of Regulatory Affairs, said in a blog post, ""Splitting off Chrome or Android would break them — and many other things.""Google will be provided with an opportunity to present its own remedies by December 20.The case, initially filed in 2020, alleged that Google maintained its dominance in the search market by creating strong barriers to entry and a feedback loop that sustained its monopoly. Google currently holds a 90% share of the search market.Judge Mehta aims to rule on the remedies by August 2025, though an appeal by Google could potentially extend the process for years.","The US Department of Justice (DOJ) indicated late Tuesday that it is weighing a potential breakup of Google as a remedy in its ongoing antitrust case against the tech giant.

'Godfather of AI' gets Nobel Prize in Physics; shares his big AI worry,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/godfather-of-ai-gets-nobel-prize-in-physics-shares-his-big-ai-worry/articleshow/114068530.cms,"Godfather of AI warns humanity of AI

Geoffrey Hinton , a British-Canadian scientist dubbed the "" Godfather of AI ,"" has been awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics alongside American professor John J. Hopfield for their work on artificial neural networks. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced the joint award on Tuesday, recognizing the researchers' crucial early contributions to the field of artificial intelligence.Hinton, 76, expressed surprise at receiving the honor. ""I'm flabbergasted,"" he told the Nobel committee. ""I was in a cheap hotel in California that does not have an internet connection and does not have a very good phone connection. I was going to get an MRI scan today, but I think I'll have to cancel that.""The scientists' work in the 1970s and '80s laid the foundation for modern AI systems, including large language models like ChatGPT. Hinton's research on ""back propagation"" algorithms and applying principles from physics to pattern recognition in data proved instrumental in advancing machine learning.However, Hinton used the occasion to warn about potential dangers posed by rapidly advancing AI technology. ""We also have to worry about a number of possible bad consequences, particularly the threat of these things getting out of control,"" he cautioned. ""I think it's very important right now for people to be working on the issue of how will we keep control. We need to put a lot of research effort into it.""The researcher, who recently left his position at Google to speak more freely about AI risks, expressed concern that AI systems could eventually surpass human intelligence. ""We have no experience of what it is like to have things smarter than us,"" Hinton said.Despite his reservations, Hinton acknowledged AI's potential benefits. ""It's going to be wonderful in many respects,"" he said. ""In areas like healthcare it's going to give us much better healthcare. In almost all industries it's going to make them more efficient. People are going to be able to do the same amount of work with an AI assistant in much less time.""Hinton emphasised the need for increased safety research, suggesting that ""one thing governments can do is force the big companies to spend a lot more of their resources on safety research, so that for example, companies like OpenAI can't just put safety research on the back burner.""When asked if he had any regrets about his work, Hinton replied, ""In the same circumstance I would do the same again, but I do worry that the overall consequence of this might be systems more intelligent than us that eventually take control.""","Geoffrey Hinton and John J.

Crypto.com CEO responds



Crypto.com issues a statement

Not the only crypto platform to accuse CES of overreach

Cryptocurrency trading platform Crypto.com has reportedly filed a case against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). According to a Reuters report, the Singapore-based company alleges that the federal agency is overstepping its jurisdiction by regulating the cryptocurrency industry. Crypto.com recently received a 'Wells notice' from the SEC stating that tokens traded on its platform qualified as securities.For those unaware, a Wells notice is a formal declaration that the regulator's staff intend to recommend an enforcement action.Taking to X (formerly Twitter), Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek said: “This unprecedented action by our company against a federal agency is a warranted response to the SEC’s regulation by enforcement regime which has hurt more than 50 million American crypto holders.”“The SEC’s unauthorized overreach and unlawful rulemaking regarding crypto must stop,” he said in another post.In a statement, the company said ""Our lawsuit contends that the SEC has unilaterally expanded its jurisdiction beyond statutory limits and separately that the SEC has established an unlawful rule that trades in nearly all crypto assets are securities transactions"".Crypto.com has filed the case in a federal court in Tyler, Texas. The lawsuit names SEC Chair Gary Gensler and four other commissioners as defendants.THe company has separately filed a petition with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the SEC, seeking a joint interpretation to confirm that certain cryptocurrency derivative products are exclusively regulated by the CFTC.Crypto.com is not the only crypto trading platform that has accused US SEC of overreach and of violating its jurisdiction. Retail trading platform Robinhood 's crypto business, major U.S. crypto exchange Coinbase and NFT marketplace OpenSea are among the companies in the digital assets industry that have received similar notices from the SEC.","Crypto.com recently received a 'Wells notice' from the SEC stating that tokens traded on its platform qualified as securities.
