Apple discontinues these accessories with the new iPhones,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-discontinues-these-accessories-with-the-new-iphones/articleshow/113211108.cms,"Before the launch of iPhone 16 series it was reported that this year Apple will discontinue some of its accessories. Now, after the launch of iPhone 16 series, Apple has discontinued the FineWoven cases.The tech giant has removed the existing FineWoven iPhone cases for older devices from its website. However, FineWoven versions of the MagSafe Wallet and AirTag Key Ring remain available.The FineWoven cases were introduced last year as a more environmentally friendly alternative to leather, but many users found them to be susceptible to dirt and fraying. The discontinuation of the FineWoven cases leaves a void in Apple's accessory lineup, as there is no direct replacement available.For the iPhone 16, customers can now choose between the Silicone Case and the Clear Case. “Apple cases for the iPhone 16 lineup work seamlessly with Camera Control , featuring a sapphire crystal coupled to a conductive layer that communicates finger movements to the Camera Control,” said the company.The silicone case with MagSafe is priced at Rs 4,900 and it is available in multiple colour options — fuchsia, ultramarine, star fruit, and lake green.As mentioned above, the iPhone FineWoven wallet with MagSafe is still available on the Apple website and is priced at Rs 5,900.","The FineWoven cases were introduced last year as a more environmentally friendly alternative to leather.

Gurman recently commented that the Gold colour looks impressive and not as bad as some early renders suggested.The iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus are expected to come in White (replacing yellow) and new shades of Green, Pink, and Blue.

Italian app developer will lay off 75% of WeTransfer staff after purchase: What company CEO said,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/italian-app-developer-will-lay-off-75-of-wetransfer-staff-after-purchase-what-company-ceo-said/articleshow/113187549.cms,"What the CEO said

Italian app developer Bending Spoons said it will lay off 75% of WeTransfer employees. According to a report by TechCrunch, the company said that the staff that is being let go will be informed after Bending Spoons goes through local regulations in different countries regarding the layoffs.To recall, the app company acquired the Dutch-based file transfer service in July for an undisclosed amount.In February, Bending Spoons raised $155 million taking the company's valuation to $2.55 billion.Bending Spoons CEO Luca Ferrari told the publication “Once the vision is clear, we try to close the gap between the status quo and the vision as quickly and as fully as we can. Typically, doing so involves making major changes to many areas, including the organisation. While we don’t enjoy making painful or unpopular decisions, we’re prepared to do so when we believe it’s the right thing to do to help the business thrive.”Adding that in WeTransfer’s case, Bending Spoons wanted to have a small and focused team, he stated “In this particular case, the vision we developed is of a smaller, more sharply focused WeTransfer organisation, which we believe will be better-positioned to serve WeTransfer’s success with a long-term view.”The TechCrunch report says that the planned layoffs at WeTransfer are not surprising as Bending Spoons regularly cuts the headcount of companies. These job cuts are aimed to operate them profitably. For example, in February 2023, the company cut 129 employees from Evernote’s staff. It did the same in December 2023 when it let go the entire workforce of Filmic, the popular photo and video editing app that it acquired in 2022.","Italian app developer Bending Spoons said it will lay off 75% of WeTransfer employees.

Musk’s vision: Transforming X into a multimedia powerhouse

Future integrations and expectations

Elon Musk , the CEO of Tesla Motors and visionary entrepreneur, has once again made headlines by launching the beta version of X TV , a new feature within the X app (formerly known as Twitter). This innovative addition is set to transform the way users consume films, live content, and recorded shows, all within the X ecosystem. By reducing reliance on external media platforms, Musk aims to consolidate entertainment and social interaction into a single space, enhancing user experience and keeping them engaged for longer periods.The beta release of X TV, unveiled on September 3, 2024, is currently available to a select group of users, whose feedback will be critical in shaping the platform’s future updates.On September 3, 2024, Musk took to his X account to announce the beta release of X TV:Although not yet available to the general public, the beta version is being tested by early adopters who are actively exploring its functionalities. The app is currently optimised for Android TVs but will soon be integrated with LG, Amazon Fire TV, and Google TV. Musk’s team has hinted at more platform expansions in the future, allowing a wider range of users to experience X TV.The beta phase is essential for collecting user feedback and making improvements before a full-scale launch. Musk has a history of leveraging user insights to fine-tune new features, and X TV is expected to follow this same iterative development model.X TV boasts several innovative features that set it apart from traditional streaming platforms. These features are designed to provide flexibility, control, and an enhanced user experience.One of the standout features is Replay TV, which allows users to store up to 72 hours of shows in the cloud. This feature ensures that users never miss a favourite program, even if they are unable to watch it live. Replay TV provides the freedom to catch up on missed content at any time within the 72-hour window, making it perfect for today’s on-the-go lifestyle.For those who tune in late to a live broadcast, Startover TV offers a game-changing solution. This feature enables viewers to restart any live show from the very beginning, ensuring they don’t miss crucial moments. Whether it's a live sporting event, a news broadcast, or a favourite TV show, Startover TV ensures that viewers can enjoy the full experience, regardless of when they begin watching.One of the most user-friendly features is Free Cloud DVR, which allows users to record up to 100 hours of content at no extra cost. This feature is particularly appealing to those who wish to store a wide range of content, from movies to series, without worrying about additional fees. By offering this feature for free, X TV positions itself as a cost-effective alternative to other streaming services that charge for cloud storage.The launch of X TV represents a significant step in Musk’s vision to turn X from a simple microblogging platform into a comprehensive multimedia hub. While the X app has long been known for its ability to disseminate real-time information and updates, the addition of X TV seeks to broaden its appeal by incorporating a variety of media experiences within the same platform.This integration is not just about expanding content options; it’s about increasing user engagement. By offering movies, live broadcasts, and recorded content, X TV gives users more reasons to stay on the platform, thus reducing the need to switch between multiple apps or services.X TV is also expected to encourage content creators, influencers, and media companies to engage with the X app more fully. The potential for live-streamed events, interactive programming, and user-generated content creates new avenues for growth and user interaction.As the X TV beta continues to roll out, additional features and platform integrations are expected in the near future. These updates may include broader compatibility with Apple TV, Roku, and other streaming devices, further increasing the app’s reach. Musk has also hinted at potential partnerships with media companies, which could lead to exclusive content being available on X TV.Furthermore, there is speculation about possible AI-driven content recommendations that would help personalise the user experience. Given Musk’s interest in AI and its integration across his companies, such a feature could be a logical next step for X TV.Another area to watch is social viewing, where users could watch content together with friends, share reactions in real-time, and discuss events as they unfold. Such features would help X TV maintain its social roots while expanding its media capabilities.","X TV is a new feature within the X app (formerly known as Twitter) It is set to transform the way users consume films, live content, and recorded shows.

Impact of public scrutiny

Pavel Durov, CEO of Telegram , has recently become the subject of widespread speculation after older photos of him resurfaced online. These images have led many to wonder whether the billionaire entrepreneur underwent plastic surgery to enhance his appearance. Adding to the intrigue, Durov was recently arrested in France, raising further questions about the man behind the popular messaging app.Pavel Durov, a 39-year-old entrepreneur originally from Russia, is best known as the founder and CEO of Telegram, a messaging app launched in 2013.Telegram quickly gained popularity for its strong emphasis on user privacy, offering end-to-end encryption and other security features that set it apart from competitors. As of now, Forbes estimates Durov's net worth to be around $15.5 billion. Despite his success in the tech industry, Durov has managed to maintain a relatively low profile—until now.Durov's recent arrest in Paris has added a new layer of complexity to his public image. He was detained in France on charges of suspected complicity in running an online platform involved in illicit activities, including child exploitation, drug trafficking, and fraud. While these allegations are serious, it is the sudden focus on Durov's physical transformation that has captured the internet's attention.Pavel Durov has been active on social media platforms like Instagram since 2011, regularly sharing photos from his travels around the world. In his recent posts, Durov appears with a full head of hair and a toned physique, often posing shirtless in various locations. However, these recent images stand in stark contrast to older photos where Durov was seen with a noticeably receding hairline.The drastic change in his appearance has fueled rumours that Durov may have undergone plastic surgery, including a possible hair transplant. A popular post on X (formerly Twitter) by a well-known account shared a side-by-side comparison of Durov's old and new photos, sparking a flurry of online discussions. The post reads, ""Pavel Durov (Telegram CEO) before his hair transplant and plastic surgery,"" and has since gone viral.The speculation around Durov's transformation has been met with a variety of opinions online. On Reddit, users have debated whether the changes in Durov's appearance are the result of surgical procedures or simply better grooming and styling.One Reddit user commented, ""This isn't a hair transplant. His hair is too thick and full to have this kind of drastic change from a HT. Most likely he's wearing a hair system (wig).""Another user added, ""There's speculation that it's not a transplant, but rather a hair system because his hair loss was much more advanced in the first picture, so when the operation happens, the resulting hairdo never looks as full as his.""Some users believe the changes are the result of plastic surgery, with one theorising, ""This is well-done surgery.""However, not everyone is convinced that surgery is involved. One Reddit user opined, ""Honestly, I think a lot of the facial 'changes' are simply due to the much better angle and lighting in the second photo.""As the speculation continues, it's clear that Durov's transformation—whether natural or assisted—has caught the public's eye. The intense scrutiny of his appearance highlights the challenges that come with being in the spotlight, especially for someone as private as Durov. Whether or not he has undergone any procedures, the discussions around his looks reflect a broader societal fascination with image and success.","Pavel Durov, 39, is the founder and CEO of Telegram, a messaging app launched in 2013.

Elon Musk praised Ratan Tata

The legacy of the Tata Nano

Also read

In the realm of business and innovation, few figures command as much respect as Tata Group chairman emeritus Ratan Tata. His influence extends far beyond the Indian corporate world, even garnering admiration from Tesla CEO and X owner Elon Musk . In a 2009 interview with American journalist Charlie Rose , Musk praised Ratan Tata as a ""gentleman and a scholar."" This moment has recently resurfaced, shedding light on Musk's appreciation for Ratan Tata and his ambitious project, the Tata Nano .The Tata Nano was introduced by Tata Motors in 2008 as the world's cheapest car, with a price tag of just Rs 1 lakh (approximately $2,300 at the time). The car was a pet project of Ratan Tata, designed to make automobile ownership accessible to millions of Indians who had never been able to afford a car. The idea was revolutionary—a small, affordable car that would cater to the vast Indian middle class, providing them with a safe and efficient means of transportation.In the interview with Charlie Rose, which took place shortly after the launch of the Tata Nano, the Tesla CEO was asked about his views on Ratan Tata’s efforts to introduce a low-cost car in India. The interview clip, which has recently gone viral, captures Musk's candid response.""Take for a moment Ratan Tata, what he’s doing in India — developing a little sedan for $2300. Where do you put that in the whole equation of where the future of cars is?"" asked Rose.Musk responded with a mix of admiration and caution. He began by acknowledging the brilliance behind the Tata Nano project and the character of Ratan Tata himself.""I think it's a good idea to have affordable cars, but I think the problem with something like the Nano ... I wouldn't say problem because I think, by the way, it is probably a great idea and Ratan is a gentleman and scholar,"" Musk said.However, Musk also expressed his concerns about the long-term viability of such a low-cost vehicle, particularly in the context of rising fuel prices. He pointed out that while the initial purchase cost of the Nano was remarkably low, the cost of running the car—particularly fuel costs—could become a significant issue as gasoline prices continued to rise.""But where it’s going to become challenging in the future is when the price of gasoline rises, the cost of acquiring the car is much less of an issue than the cost of running the car,"" the billionnaire explained.Despite the initial excitement surrounding the Tata Nano, the car faced numerous challenges. One of the most significant issues was its branding. While the Nano was intended to be an affordable vehicle for the masses, it was often labeled as ""cheap"" rather than ""affordable."" This perception problem, combined with safety concerns and competition from other small cars, led to unimpressive sales figures.The Nano’s production was ultimately discontinued in 2018, marking the end of what was initially seen as a groundbreaking project. The car's journey from inception to discontinuation is often cited as one of the biggest marketing failures in the automobile industry.","The Tata Nano was introduced by Tata Motors in 2008 as the world's cheapest car, with a price tag of just Rs 1 lakh (approximately $2,300 at the time) The car was a pet project of Ratan Tata, designed to make automobile ownership accessible to millions of Indians who had never been able to afford a car.

Ola CEO Bhavish Aggarwal has once again reiterated his stance on fostering the Indian technology sector. Aggarwal took to microblogging site X (formerly known as Twitter) to share his views on the latest report of Delhi High Court slamming Wikipedia over non-compliance with Indian laws.In the post, he wrote “Another proof of why we need to build our tech stack in India. These platforms don’t even comply with Indian laws and then even ignore court judgements!”.But he did not stop there.Aggarwal took aim at Elon Musk 's social media platform, Twitter, leveraging the Wikipedia incident to slam the platform. He said “Also, just look at Twitter’s arm twisting of the Brazilian Supreme Court .”“The more we ignore and justify, more we risk,” he further added.Recently, Brazil Supreme Court banned X after a protracted legal battle. The battle started in April this year when Judge de Moraes directed X to suspend several accounts alleged to be disseminating false information. X's refusal to follow this order resulted in the current suspension in addition to a penalty of 50,000 reais (approximately Rs. 7.47 lakh) for any efforts to bypass the ban, including the use of VPNs.Elon Musk reacted to the announcement with fury, dubbing Moraes as ‘evil dictator’.The Delhi High Court threatened Wikipedia to block the website if it doesn’t comply with India’s laws. Justice Navin Chawla delivered the warning during a hearing related to a defamation case filed by news agency ANI against Wikipedia.""If you don't like India, please don't work in India... We will ask government to block your site,"" Justice Chawla declared, as reported by legal news website Bar and Bench.","Ola CEO Bhavish Aggarwal took to X (formerly known as Twitter) to share his views on the latest report of Delhi High Court slamming Wikipedia over non- compliance with Indian laws.
