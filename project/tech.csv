During a recent conversation with LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman , Nadella emphasised the critical qualities needed to navigate the evolving business landscape.""I think the world needs today, more than anything else from leaders, are optimism and energy ,"" Nadella stated.""It's easy to be down on everything [but] my true measure of any leader is who can come into a situation, bring clarity, generate energy, and solve over-constrained problems. As long as you do those three things, I think the world will be a better place.""Nadella's definition comes at a time when companies are facing significant challenges, particularly in managing remote work and employee expectations. The Microsoft CEO highlighted a ""productivity paradox"" that many organisations are experiencing:""Eighty-five percent of managers think their employees aren't working hard enough, while 85 percent of employees report feeling exhausted and overworked. And these are real statistics!"" he revealed.To address this disconnect, Nadella advocates for a data-driven approach to leadership. ""Dogma won't fix this issue,"" he explained. ""Leaders need to focus on clear, aligned goals and use data to measure output and performance.""The Microsoft CEP also stressed the importance of developing new soft skills to effectively manage employees in the changing work environment. ""People come for people, not policy,"" Nadella observed, suggesting that leaders must learn to create engaging occasions and events to bring teams together.""As leaders, we have to learn how to bring clarity to what is the output that you'd like to see. What are the measures of it and then using that to see whether it is working or not and then create the norms,"" he added.Nadella's insights offer a roadmap for leadership in the face of evolving workplace challenges. By focusing on optimism, energy, clarity, and data-driven problem-solving, leaders can work to bridge the gap between management expectations and employee experiences, ultimately fostering a more productive and harmonious workplace.","Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has outlined his vision of a "" true leader"" He emphasised the critical qualities needed to navigate the evolving business landscape.

How this partnership will help Trinidad and Tobago



NIPL is actively promoting India's UPI system globally



NIPL , a subsidiary of the National Payments Corporation of India ( NPCI ), has partnered with the Ministry of Digital Transformation of Trinidad and Tobago . This partnership will help the Caribbean nation establish a real-time payment platform that will mirror the functionality and success of India's widely adopted Unified Payments Interface ( UPI ) system.The report added that this partnership builds on the strong, longstanding bilateral ties between the two countries.“This collaboration marks a significant milestone, making Trinidad and Tobago the first Caribbean nation to adopt the globally renowned UPI,” NPCI said in a statement to the news agency PTI.As per the report, the primary goal of this collaboration is to equip Trinidad and Tobago with a real-time payment system that will enable easy and secure digital transactions between individuals and businesses in the country. The system is expected to drive the growth of digital payments across the nation, further promoting financial inclusivity .This system is expected to improve Trinidad and Tobago's financial infrastructure which will use the technology and expertise behind India's successful UPI system. This modernisation effort will focus on increasing accessibility, affordability, and connectivity to both domestic and international payment networks. It will also ensure interoperability, enabling easy transactions across different platforms and financial institutions.The NPCI subsidiary is in discussions with over 20 countries in Africa and South America to help them develop UPI-like platforms. Deals are already signed with Peru and Namibia, with launches expected by early 2027. Rwanda is also reportedly in serious discussions.Beyond building new systems, NIPL is focused on connecting UPI with existing real-time payment systems in other countries. Several links are already live, and more are planned. To support this expansion, NIPL plans to double its workforce by March 2025 and increase its overseas presence.Currently, UPI is accepted in several countries, including France, Bhutan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Singapore, the UAE, and others.UPI has also transformed India’s digital payment sector as it processed a staggering 15 billion transactions in August 2024.","NIPL, a subsidiary of the National Payments Corporation of India, has partnered with the Ministry of Digital Transformation of Trinidad and Tobago.

What the company said about the $100 million penalty



""We took immediate action to fix this error, and there is no evidence that these passwords were abused or accessed improperly. We proactively flagged this issue to our lead regulator, the Irish Data Protection Commission, and have engaged constructively with them throughout this inquiry,""

What Ireland’s DPC alleged against Meta

""It is widely accepted that user passwords should not be stored in plaintext, considering the risks of abuse that arise from persons accessing such data,""

Facebook parent Meta is facing a $100 million fine in the European Union (EU). The penalty was imposed by EU’s leading privacy regulator, the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) for an alleged security lapse . According to a report by the news agency AP, the social media platform stored users' passwords in 'plaintext' which had no encryption or protection.This made EU users potentially vulnerable to unauthorized access. This significant fine comes after a five-year investigation triggered by Meta's own disclosure of the issue to DPC in 2019.While Meta publicly acknowledged the incident at the time and the DPC has confirmed that the passwords were not accessed by any external parties, the breach represents a violation of user privacy and data protection regulations .Meta said in a statement to AP.Earlier, Meta noted that a security review discovered that a ""subset"" of Facebook users' passwords were ""temporarily logged in a readable format,"" the report added.Irish DPC Deputy Commissioner Graham Doyle said in a separate statement to the news agency Reuters.As most major US internet companies base their European operations in Ireland, the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) has become the primary EU regulator overseeing their compliance with the bloc's strict data privacy laws.This fine is the latest in a string of significant penalties imposed on Meta and its platforms by European regulators for data privacy violations. Other recent fines include a $451 million penalty for Instagram's mishandling of teen data, a $6.1 million fine related to WhatsApp and a massive $1.3 billion fine levied against Meta for issues with data transfers to the US.","Facebook parent Meta is facing a $100 million fine in the European Union (EU) The penalty was imposed by EU’s leading privacy regulator, the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) According to a report, the social media platform stored users' passwords in 'plaintext' which had no encryption or protection.

Dell’s return to office push faces backlash from employees: “God help them…”,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/dells-return-to-office-push-faces-backlash-from-employees-god-help-them/articleshow/113735856.cms,"Dell employees get email mandating return to office

Take a look at the email

Dell employees express discontent

Dell’s recent announcement mandating a return to the office has sparked a wave of discontent among its employees. Starting September 30, the global sales team at Dell will be required to work from office five days a week. “The Sales floor is a unique environment that combines high energy with a culture of collaboration and continuous improvement. To harness this energy and grow skills, we believe our sales teams need to be together in the office,” the company said in an email to its employees.The email reads “This sales force has a culture of winning and a reputation of outpacing the competition. We are the best in the business! That doesn't come without dedicated focus, perseverance and grit. To uphold this legacy, we must continuously work at it. To grow faster than the market and take share, we must always be sharpening our edge.”“The Sales floor is a unique environment that combines high energy with a culture of collaboration and continuous improvement. To harness this energy and grow skills, we believe our sales teams need to be together in the office. Additionally, our data shows that sales teams are more productive when onsite.”“With that in mind, starting Monday, Sept. 30, the expectation is that ALL Global Sales team members who can work from a Dell office be onsite five days a week, regardless of role. Field sellers are expected to spend five days a week with customers and partners or in a Dell Technologies office. Field sellers who can't go into a Dell office should prioritize time spent in person with customers and partners. Remote sales team members who can't go into a Dell office should continue to work remotely. More communications pertaining to remote workers will be sent in the coming weeks.”Dell employees are not pleased with the return-to-office push, as evidenced by a viral Reddit post. The post, which appears to have been shared by a Dell employee, gained significant traction. The caption reads, “Just received this email from leadership, and starting this Monday, we’re all expected to return to the office five days a week for at least six hours each day at Dell.” Additionally, the post includes a screenshot of the email received by Dell employees regarding the latest return-to-office mandate.Commenting on the post, a user said “Expect a drop in productivity as soon as everyone is back in the office. Guaranteed”. Another replied “Hmm. Dell is sinking rapidly. I wonder if that is why they are doing this. Is this some way for Mr. Dell to recoup all his money in commercial real estate and line his golden parachute at the workers' expense?”.A third user said “Dell needs to not do this. They're already shit with the staff they have. God help them if the remote employees quit because of this.” Another user said “This is a layoff round. They are trying to get people to quit.","Starting September 30, the global sales team at Dell will be required to work from office five days a week. “The Sales floor is a unique environment that combines high energy with a culture of collaboration and continuous improvement,” the company said in an email to its employees.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113737003,imgsize-13138,width-400,resizemode-4/113737003.jpg"

Hi all,

I have something to share with you. After much reflection, I have made the difficult decision to leave OpenAl. My six-and-a-half years with the OpenAl team have been an extraordinary privilege. While I'll express my gratitude to many individuals in the coming days, I want to start by thanking Sam and Greg for their trust in me to lead the technical organization and for their support throughout the years. There's never an ideal time to step away from a place one cherishes, yet this moment feels right. Our recent releases of speech-to-speech and OpenAl 01 mark the beginning of a new era in interaction and intelligence - achievements made possible by your ingenuity and craftsmanship. We didn't merely build smarter models, we fundamentally changed how Al systems learn and reason through complex problems. We brought safety research from the theoretical realm into practical applications, creating models that are more robust, aligned, and steerable than ever before. Our work has made cutting-edge Al research intuitive and accessible, developing technology that adapts and evolves based on everyone's input. This success is a testament to our outstanding teamwork, and it is because of your brilliance, your dedication, and your commitment that OpenAl stands at the pinnacle of AI innovation. I'm stepping away because I want to create the time and space to do my own exploration. For now, my primary focus is doing everything in my power to ensure a smooth transition, maintaining the momentum we've built.

I will forever be grateful for the opportunity to build and work alongside this remarkable team. Together, we've pushed the boundaries of scientific understanding in our quest to improve human well-being. While I may no longer be in the trenches with you, I will still be rooting for you all. With deep gratitude for the friendships forged, the triumphs achieved, and most importantly, the challenges overcome together.

Mira



What OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said

Hi All

Mira has been instrumental to OpenAI’s progress and growth the last 6.5 years; she has been a hugely significant factor in our development from an unknown research lab to an important company.

When Mira informed me this morning that she was leaving, I was saddened but of course support her decision. For the past year, she has been building out a strong bench of leaders that will continue our progress.

I also want to share that Bob and Barret have decided to depart OpenAI. Mira, Bob, and Barret made these decisions independently of each other and amicably, but the timing of Mira’s decision was such that it made sense to now do this all at once, so that we can work together for a smooth handover to the next generation of leadership.

I am extremely grateful to all of them for their contributions.

Being a leader at OpenAI is all-consuming. On one hand it’s a privilege to build AGI and be the fastest-growing company that gets to put our advanced research in the hands of hundreds of millions of people. On the other hand it’s relentless to lead a team through it—and they have gone above and beyond the call of duty for the company.

Mark is going to be our new SVP of Research and will now lead the research org in partnership with Jakub as Chief Scientist. This has been our long-term succession plan for Bob someday; although it’s happening sooner than we thought, I couldn’t be more excited that Mark is stepping into the role. Mark obviously has deep technical expertise, but he has also learned how to be a leader and manager in a very impressive way over the past few years.

Josh Achiam is going to take on a new role as Head of Mission Alignment, working across the company to ensure that we get all pieces (and culture) right to be in a place to succeed at the mission.

Kevin and Srinivas will continue to lead the Applied team.

Matt Knight will be our Chief Information Security Officer having already served in this capacity for a long time. This has been our plan for quite some time.

Mark, Jakub, Kevin, Srinivas, Matt, and Josh will report to me. I have over the past year or so spent most of my time on the non-technical parts of our organization; I am now looking forward to spending most of my time on the technical and product parts of the company.

...

Leadership changes are a natural part of companies, especially companies that grow so quickly and are so demanding. I obviously won’t pretend it’s natural for this one to be so abrupt, but we are not a normal company, and I think the reasons Mira explained to me (there is never a good time, anything not abrupt would have leaked, and she wanted to do this while OpenAI was in an upswing) make sense. We can both talk about this more tomorrow during all-hands.

Thank you for all of your hard work and dedication.

Sam

I am grateful and proud to be a part of this incredible IndiGo journey with my colleagues - giving wings to the nation with over 2,000 daily flights, 430+ domestic and 100+ international routes, and growing every day.

When I had joined, I had shared the quote, ""Wherever you go, becomes a part of you somehow”. Being a part of IndiGo and now living now in India for two years....IndiGo and this beautiful country India have indeed become a part of me. Bharat ab ghar jaisa lagta hai.

India's essence is captured in its beautiful diversity. Of our 88 domestic cities, I had the pleasure of visiting our great teams in 30. From Thiruvananthapuram in the south to Leh in the north. My most recent visit was to Leh, where walking with my son at 18,000 feet at the Khardung La Pass was very special considering my roots are from a country where the highest ""hill"" is some 300 metres only and around 25% of the land is below sea level 😊

Here are some pictures from my travels in the last two years. Can you guess the cities?

The US Department of Justice has reportedly launched an investigation into Super Micro Computer , a major player in the artificial intelligence server market, following allegations of accounting irregularities by short-seller Hindenburg Research . The probe, still in its early stages, sent Super Micro's shares tumbling 12% on Thursday.According to The Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the matter, a prosecutor from the US attorney's office in San Francisco has begun reaching out to individuals who may possess relevant information.The inquiry appears to be connected to accusations made by a former employee regarding accounting violations at the company.This development comes on the heels of Hindenburg Research's August report, which claimed to have uncovered ""fresh evidence of accounting manipulation"" at Super Micro. The short-seller's allegations, based on a three-month investigation including interviews with former senior employees and examination of litigation records, encompassed issues such as undisclosed related-party transactions and potential export control violations.In response to Hindenburg's report, Super Micro delayed filing its annual report with the Securities and Exchange Commission , citing a need to evaluate its internal financial controls. The company had previously denied Hindenburg's claims.Super Micro, which manufactures high-performance servers used in AI applications, has been riding the wave of enthusiasm surrounding artificial intelligence. Its client roster includes tech giants like Nvidia , AMD , and Intel . The company's market value had skyrocketed from $4.4 billion to $67 billion earlier this year, reflecting the broader AI boom.The Wall Street Journal reports that when asked for comment, Super Micro declined to address the probe, while the Justice Department stated it could neither confirm nor deny the existence of an investigation.",US Department of Justice reportedly launches investigation into Super Micro Computer.

The lawsuit, filed this week in Manhattan federal court, alleges that Amazon deliberately misled shoppers by using Aerie branding in sponsored ads and search results to direct customers to counterfeit products .The clothing retailer claims Amazon used ""flagrant, unauthorised use"" of its trademark to deceive consumers into believing genuine Aerie products were available on the platform. According to the complaint, clicking on these misleading links leads shoppers to pages displaying only "" knock-offs and 'dupes'"" of Aerie merchandise.American Eagle states it had previously declined Amazon's request to sell Aerie products on its site, preferring to maintain control over the brand's identity and customer experience. The company asserts it notified Amazon of the alleged infringement over a month ago but claims the e-commerce platform responded by relabeling products with misspellings like ""Aeries"" and ""Aries.""The lawsuit seeks an injunction to halt further trademark infringement , as well as financial damages. American Eagle argues that Amazon's actions have caused confusion among consumers and potentially damaged the Aerie brand's reputation by associating it with inferior quality merchandise.This lawsuit is not the first of its kind against Amazon. The e-commerce giant has faced similar complaints for years regarding counterfeit products on its platform. In 2016, German shoemaker Birkenstock announced it would pull its products from Amazon due to a surge in counterfeits. That same year, German automaker Daimler AG sued Amazon after discovering knock-off versions of Mercedes-Benz wheels sold by a third-party seller.These incidents led to the company adding a warning about the threat of third-party sellers peddling counterfeits to the ""risk factors"" section of its annual financial filing in 2019. Since then, Amazon has increased its efforts to combat counterfeits, including launching teams to pursue criminal action against counterfeiters and developing tools to help brands protect their trademarks.","American Eagle Outfitters accuses Amazon of infringing on its Aerie and Offline by Aerie trademarks.

ChatGPT-maker OpenAI‘s board is reportedly planning to restructure its core business into a for-profit benefit corporation, giving CEO Sam Altman an equity stake. According to a report by Bloomberg, Altman, who is already a billionaire, may emerge from it a much richer man, depending on how the situation unfolds. Quoting sources familiar with the matter, the report says that if the fundraising “values OpenAI at $150 billion” and if “Altman ends up with a 7% stake, his fortune may soar by more than $10 billion”, adding that this “would land him among the world’s very richest people.”Altman has often stated that he doesn’t own equity in the company because he already has enough money.Last year, Altman testified in a Senate hearing saying that “I am paid enough for health insurance; I have no equity in OpenAI”. “I’m doing this because I love it,” he then said. Having said that, it is important to note here that he has occasionally mentioned that he wishes he had taken a stake, if only to stop people from asking him about it.For those unaware, OpenAI was founded as a non-profit organisation to build safe and beneficial artificial general intelligence or AGI for the benefit of humanity. It is currently governed by the board of the OpenAI Nonprofit, comprising of Independent Directors Bret Taylor (Chair), Sam Altman, Adam D’Angelo, Dr. Sue Desmond-Hellmann, Retired U.S. Army General Paul M. Nakasone, Nicole Seligman, Fidji Simo, Larry Summers and Zico Kolter.Altman, who co-founded the company in 2015, has not taken a stake in OpenAI up to this point. Receiving shares of OpenAI would let Altman benefit from one of his most valuable engagements. A previous report by Bloomberg News said that OpenAI was in talks to raise $6.5 billion from investors at a valuation of $150 billion, which would make it one of the world’s most valuable startups.Bret Taylor, chairman of the OpenAI board, in a statement said that the conversations were still in flux. “The board has had discussions about whether it would be beneficial to the company and our mission to have Sam be compensated with equity, but no specific figures have been discussed nor have any decisions been made.”","ChatGPT-maker OpenAI’s board is reportedly planning to restructure its core business into a for-profit benefit corporation, giving CEO Sam Altman an equity stake. According to a report by Bloomberg, Altman, who is already a billionaire, may emerge from it a much richer man, depending on how the situation unfolds.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113725133,imgsize-18368,width-400,resizemode-4/113725133.jpg"
Bengaluru-based MNC exec loses Rs 51 lakh in ‘digital arrest’ scam that lasted 10 hours,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/bengaluru-based-mnc-exec-loses-rs-51-lakh-in-digital-arrest-scam-that-lasted-10-hours/articleshow/113720656.cms,"What exactly happened

A high-ranking executive at a multinational company (MNC) in Bengaluru was subjected to a 10-hour ""digital arrest"" scam, resulting in a financial loss of Rs 51 lakh. The victim, a product marketing head, was tricked into believing that they were under investigation by law enforcement agencies.The victim revealed that she received a call from the scammers around 9.50 am on September 17 claiming to be from FedEx.Following the caller's instructions to press 9, she spoke to a person who identified themselves as Ashwin Kumar from FedEx customer care. Kumar informed her that someone had used her Aadhaar details to send a parcel containing MDMA to Iran, which had been seized by the Mumbai police.The caller transferred the call, claiming it was to the Mumbai cybercrime department . A person named Pradeep, who identified themselves as a senior inspector, spoke to her about the drug consignment. The victim overheard someone else informing Pradeep that her Aadhaar card had been used for illegal activities in Jammu & Kashmir, West Bengal, and Karnataka.""I was then asked to come on a Skype call. A person introducing himself as DCP Milind Bharambe, Maharashtra, said illegal accounts have been opened across the country using my Aadhaar and Rs 9.7 crore have been moved through these accounts. He said the account was used for drug trafficking, money laundering, and funding sleeper cells to purchase AK-47 rifles,” the victim told TOI.The victim was instructed to maintain confidentiality and told that they were under digital house arrest. The call was then transferred to a person who identified themselves as George Mathew from the Reserve Bank of India. Mathew informed the victim that the RBI would investigate their account and that even a single rupee of black money could lead to seven years in prison.Mathew instructed the victim to open her bank mobile app and add eight beneficiaries. He then asked her to go to the pre-approved loan section and send him a screenshot. The scammers discovered that she was eligible for a ₹50 lakh pre-approved loan and instructed her to click on it, claiming the money would be used for the investigation. The victim followed their instructions, and her account was credited with the Rs 49,92,921 loan. The fraudsters quickly transferred this amount, along with other money in her account, totalling Rs 51.2 lakh, to the newly added beneficiaries.The ordeal lasted ten hours, during which the victim was denied food and water. When she later contacted the fraudsters to inquire about the promised refund, they did not respond. Realising she had been scammed, she immediately called the cyber helpline 1930.","The victim, a product marketing head, was tricked into believing that they were under investigation by law enforcement agencies.

Tesla’s stunning comeback

Key factors driving the surge in Elon Musk’s wealth

Tesla’s market performance: Tesla’s stock recovery has played the most crucial role in Musk’s resurgence. Investor optimism surrounding Tesla’s growth potential, advances in electric vehicles (EVs), and new product developments have driven the company's share price higher.

Improved economic conditions: The broader US economy has shown signs of improvement, and the Federal Reserve's decision to cut interest rates has helped alleviate fears of inflation and a potential recession. These moves have supported the stock market's recovery, benefitting Tesla and other tech-related companies.

Global EV demand: The global push toward clean energy and the growing demand for electric vehicles continue to bolster Tesla’s long-term prospects. While Chinese competitors have posed challenges, Tesla's reputation and continued innovation in the EV space keep it as a leader in the industry.

Musk's expanding portfolio beyond Tesla

SpaceX : Musk owns 42% of SpaceX, which was valued at $210 billion as of June 2023. SpaceX has continued to break new ground with ambitious projects like Starship and satellite internet service Starlink, reinforcing Musk's position in the space industry.

X (formerly Twitter): Musk acquired Twitter, now rebranded as X, for $44 billion in 2022. His vision for transforming the platform into an “everything app” encompassing social media, payments, and other services remains in development.

Neuralink: Musk's neurotechnology company, Neuralink, aims to develop brain-computer interfaces to help people with neurological conditions. Though still in its early stages, Neuralink is seen as a pioneer in the field of brain-machine technology.

The Boring Company: Musk’s infrastructure and tunnelling company focuses on transportation innovations, including building underground tunnels for high-speed transit systems in major cities.

xAI: Launched in July 2023, Musk’s artificial intelligence startup, xAI, aims to develop AI systems that benefit humanity. This new venture underscores Musk's commitment to staying at the forefront of cutting-edge technology.

Musk reclaiming the top spot

Elon Musk , the world's wealthiest person, has seen his fortune rise dramatically in 2023, with his net worth reaching $270 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Musk's wealth has surged by over $100 billion since April, marking an extraordinary rebound following a significant dip earlier in the year.At the beginning of the year, Musk’s net worth was $229 billion.However, by April, his fortune had plummeted to $164 billion due to a sharp 40% drop in Tesla’s stock price. Investors expressed concerns over Tesla’s performance, including disappointing delivery numbers in the first quarter of the year, and challenges from rising interest rates and increasing competition from Chinese automakers like BYD. These factors, combined with price cuts that impacted Tesla 's profit margins, caused a dip in Musk's wealth.The tide began to turn for Musk as Tesla shares rebounded by over 80% from their April low, restoring confidence in the company and its long-term outlook. Since early August alone, Musk's net worth has increased by $50 billion, a testament to the positive momentum surrounding Tesla and the broader stock market.In particular, Musk's fortune surged from $223 billion in early August to $270 billion in September, making him the fourth-largest wealth gainer of the year. Only Mark Zuckerberg (Meta), Jensen Huang (Nvidia), and Larry Ellison (Oracle) have seen more significant gains this year, with Musk leapfrogging other billionaires who had outpaced him earlier in the year.Several factors have contributed to this turnaround:While Tesla remains the primary driver of Musk’s wealth, his portfolio extends far beyond the electric vehicle giant. Musk holds significant stakes in several high-profile companies, including:Despite the fluctuations in his wealth throughout the year, Musk has retained his title as the richest person on the planet. He remains ahead of other billionaires like Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. However, it is worth noting that Musk's current wealth of $270 billion is still below his all-time high of $340 billion, which he reached in November 2021.Musk's rapid ascent in wealth since April signals a strong comeback after his status as the biggest wealth loser earlier in the year. His journey from a $100 billion decline to a $41 billion gain underscores the volatility of financial markets and Musk’s ability to adapt and thrive despite economic headwinds.As Musk continues to lead several groundbreaking companies, his influence extends across industries such as automotive, space exploration, social media, and artificial intelligence. While Tesla’s stock performance remains crucial to his net worth, his diverse portfolio ensures that his wealth is spread across various cutting-edge sectors.Looking forward, Musk’s wealth is expected to fluctuate with market conditions, Tesla’s continued innovations, and the progress of his other ventures. However, his ability to maintain his position at the top of the global wealth rankings reflects his resilience and strategic foresight.","Elon Musk is the world's wealthiest person, with a net worth of $270 billion.

What makes Appario Retail lawsuit important

Appario, the former biggest seller on Amazon India , has filed a legal challenge against the Competition Commission of India ( CCI ) over an antitrust investigation that found the e-commerce giant and several of its sellers in violation of local competition laws.According to a report in Reuters, the lawsuit, filed by Appario in the Karnataka High Court , seeks to quash the CCI's investigation report and a related order that required the company to submit its financial statements.Appario argues that the investigation was flawed and that the CCI exceeded its authority.Appario, which has since ceased to be a seller on Amazon, challenged the CCI in the High Court in Karnataka, saying the investigation report that names it must be ""set aside"", showed court records.The CCI's investigation, which began in 2020, followed a Reuters report that revealed Amazon's preferential treatment of certain sellers on its platform. The report alleged that Amazon had given Appario and a small group of other sellers special privileges, including discounted fees and access to proprietary tools. In 2022, the CCI raided Appario and some other sellers as part of its investigations.Amazon has consistently denied any wrongdoing, claiming that it treats all sellers fairly and complies with Indian laws. However, the CCI's findings and the subsequent legal challenge pose a significant challenge to the company's operations in India.The lawsuit marks the first legal challenge to the CCI's investigation and could have broader implications for the e-commerce industry in India. If Appario is successful, it could set a precedent that could embolden other companies to challenge the CCI's authority.","Appario, the former biggest seller on Amazon India, has filed a legal challenge against the Competition Commission of India.

What is the “Peaklight” malware

""This memory-only dropper decrypts and executes a PowerShell-based downloader. This PowerShell-based downloader is being tracked as PEAKLIGHT,”

How hackers can use Peaklight to infect Windows PCs

Connection to a hidden source: It connects to a content delivery network (CDN) that conceals harmful JavaScript code. This code executes directly in a computer's memory, leaving no trace on the system’s hard drive.

It connects to a content delivery network (CDN) that conceals harmful JavaScript code. This code executes directly in a computer's memory, leaving no trace on the system’s hard drive. Unleashing the malware downloader : The JavaScript then activates a PowerShell script named Peaklight.

The JavaScript then activates a PowerShell script named Peaklight. Downloading more threats: Peaklight acts as a downloader, retrieving additional malware from a remote server. This could include dangerous programs like Lumma Stealer, Hijack Loader, and CryptBot, which can steal user data or give attackers control of the user's computer.

""PEAKLIGHT is an obfuscated PowerShell-based downloader that is part of a multi-stage execution chain that checks for the presence of ZIP archives in hard-coded file paths. If the archives do not exist, the downloader will reach out to a CDN site download the remotely hosted archive file and save it to disk.”

A novel type of malware known as Peaklight has emerged and is specifically targeting individuals who engage in the downloading of movies from illicit websites. This “advanced” malware is designed to infect Windows computers, ultimately deploying information stealers and loaders. Security researchers affiliated with Google’s cybersecurity firm Mandiant have issued a stark warning regarding the potential risks associated with visiting such websites, which encompass not only legal repercussions but also the exposure to malware such as Peaklight.In a blog post, Mandiant claims that Peaklight is a new and stealthy malware that operates entirely within a computer's memory, leaving no trace on the hard drive which makes it difficult to detect. Security researchers claimed that this malware is designed to discreetly download additional harmful software onto infected Windows systems.Mandiant noted.Mandiant explained that Peaklight uses a covert PowerShell script to deploy additional malware onto infected systems. This method facilitates the distribution of harmful programs such as Lumma Stealer , Hijack Loader, and CryptBot. These programs are offered as services for rent, enabling cyber attackers to steal information or take control of compromised computers.As per the report, cybercriminals are spreading the malware through fake movie downloads. For this, hackers are hiding dangerous Windows shortcut files (LNKs) within ZIP folders disguised as popular films.Once opened, the LNK file triggers the following chain reaction:The report noted that the malware was particularly stealthy because it operates entirely within the computer's memory (RAM). This makes it very difficult for traditional antivirus software to detect, as most antivirus programs primarily scan the user’s hard drive for threats.Mandiant researchers Aaron Lee and Praveeth D'Souza said:","Malware known as Peaklight has emerged and is specifically targeting individuals who engage in the downloading of movies from illicit websites.

What Binance said about the scam



“This case showcases the critical importance of collaboration between public institutions like the ED and private entities like Binance in addressing the new types of digital threats.”

The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has identified and arrested four individuals in connection with an online gaming app, Fiewin . The app, initially presented as a legitimate platform for users to earn money through games, is now under investigation for its role in defrauding users of over Rs 400 crore. The money was then laundered using digital wallets linked to a global crypto exchange.World’s largest crypto platform Binance claimed that its Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) provided critical intelligence that helped ED in tracing the funds and uncovering the fraud network. According to a report by The Economic Times, the ED probe also discovered that the platform Chinese nationals allegedly operated the illegal betting/gaming app with the help of their Indian accomplices.In a report, Binance explained that the Fiewin app gained traction by promising users the opportunity to earn money easily by playing mini-games. The app allowed new users to quickly create an account and begin participating in the app’s activities, with the option to ""top up"" their in-app balance via various payment methods.However, reports have surfaced suggesting that once users' accounts accumulated substantial funds, the app stopped allowing them to withdraw the funds, leaving them unable to recover their money.An investigation by the ED revealed that Rs 400 crore was stolen through this scheme. This money was transferred into various cryptocurrency addresses, which were later traced back to the operation.Local police across the country began receiving reports from victims who lost funds to the Fiewin app. Due to the growing number of victims reporting the scams, the case was escalated to ED.Through its investigation, ED discovered that the app had been part of a cross-border criminal network it used various methods to obfuscate the origin and movement of illicit funds by utilizing bank accounts of “mules” and cryptocurrency wallets, creating a complex web of transactions to hinder detection and tracing.The investigation has led to the arrest of several individuals who played key roles in facilitating the fraud, working in tandem with handlers linked to Fiewin’s gaming apps. The criminals communicated via privacy-focused messaging apps and operated from various locations, ED added.an ED representative said.Binance Investigation Specialist, Ferdinando D. added.","The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has identified and arrested four individuals in connection with an online gaming app, Fiewin.

IT firms profit from cost-of-living adjustments clause,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/it-firms-profit-from-cost-of-living-adjustments-clause/articleshow/113701361.cms,"For a long time, IT companies hadn’t enforced cost of living adjustments (COLA) because inflation rates remained relatively low. This situation changed when inflation rates surged, putting companies under considerable pressure. They found themselves grappling with higher salaries, especially in India, but were unable to pass on these extra costs to their clients.Sometimes clients believe that they are paying a fair price and would resist price increases.For some time now, the inclusion of COLA clauses in contracts has become a common practice in the industry. These clauses allow companies to adjust their fees based on changes in the cost of living, ensuring that they can maintain their profitability and continue to provide quality services to their clients without bearing the full burden of inflation-driven expenses.At Cognizant, for instance, a cost-of-living adjustment was applied to the compensation of each of their employees residing in a jurisdiction other than its CEO Ravi Kumar ’s principal work location (the United States) to adjust the compensation of such employees to the jurisdiction of Mr Kumar's principal work location. Each such cost-of-living index, including that for India, the location of the worldwide median employee, was used to adjust the applicable compensation of employees to the cost-of-living index for the United States. All cost-of-living indexes used were as published by cost-of-living databases provider Numbeo.com for 2023, Cognizant said in its proxy filing.Peter Bendor-Samuel , CEO of IT research advisory Everest Group, said, “COLA is historically a significant source of profit for the IT firms . It is not shared with employees and is used to support earnings. As market conditions have tightened, it is harder for firms to get COLA into contracts, but where they can, they work hard to ensure that they are in place as they help profitability.”Stanton Jones, distinguished analyst at ISG, said the cost-of-living adjustments were not added to IT services contracts for many years because inflation was low. “However, when inflation spiked, it put a lot of pressure on firms as salaries rose (especially in India) but they were unable to pass these costs on to clients. It’s now regular practice to include these clauses in contracts.”Bendor-Samuel said wage increases for employees are driven by local market conditions and are not connected to COLA adjustments. “COLA is only indirectly linked to wage increases because wage inflation will allow for COLA adjustments. However, if a firm can make COLA adjustments but not increase wages, they will do that. But if there is significant wage inflation, then the COLA provisions will activate. Again, it is becoming harder to get COLA into new contracts as firms are looking for price decreases in the current market.”Jones said in terms of COLA, it’s an index used in multi-year outsourcing relationships to make sure prices for managed services (or rate cards) are aligned with the impact of inflation on operating costs. “Wages are an important part of the operating cost for a provider, but not the only one. Also important to keep in mind that enterprises generally do not have visibility into the specific or even aggregate level of compensation of their provider teams,” he added.","For a long time, IT companies hadn’t enforced cost of living adjustments (COLA) because inflation rates remained relatively low.
