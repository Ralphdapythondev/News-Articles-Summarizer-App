Mitigating misinformation

Apple launched several AI-powered features under the Apple Intelligence system at last week’s Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC). These features will be coming in late 2024 and the first half of 2025 – marking a shift in rollout strategy for the company.According to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, Apple not following a strict timeline when it comes to rolling out AI features to users has several benefits for the Cupertino-based tech giant. Gurman, however, noted that Apple Intelligence's initial rollout with iOS 18 will include several functionalities such as leveraging AI to prioritise notifications, provide summaries of alerts and text messages as well as new writing tools, image generation and custom AI-generated emoji (Genmoji)..These capabilities are said to come at a later stage, and won't be available in the first beta version of iOS 18. Apple typically releases the new iOS version publicly in September, coinciding with iPhone sales launches. Since iPhones require manufacturing and operating system installation weeks in advance, features need to be finalised by mid-August.This time around a portion of the AI services will be delayed until next year due to these time constraints. Gurman has also listed out a bunch of reasons why this slow-roll of AI feature is the right choice for the company.A phased rollout of AI features will help Apple prevent staffing bottlenecks, allowing engineers to focus on specific features, release them and then move on to others. This strategy will help the company avoid overwhelming developers and past issues with rushed launches.Launching AI features with American English first allows more time to train AI models for other languages – which is a complex task. Global availability will take time but this will also help the company to better test its, which in turn provide better functionality from the beginning.Recently, a report said that Apple is training its model on Google’s TPUs as it does not have a large and sophisticated infrastructure like Google or Microsoft. Apple is building its cloud infrastructure to handle Apple Intelligence features. A gradual rollout reduces the risk of network crashes from a sudden surge in users. This approach also benefits OpenAI, which partners with Apple and utilises Microsoft servers for its chatbot.One of the main problems with AI-generated responses is misinformation. Starting with a smaller user base will allow Apple for better monitoring and quicker fixes for potential AI-generated misinformation (like OpenAI's ChatGPT). This limits the spread of inaccurate information.","Apple launched several AI-powered features under the Apple Intelligence system at last week’s Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) These features will be coming in late 2024 and the first half of 2025 – marking a shift in rollout strategy for the company.

Infosys' Arguments and Counter-Arguments by Tangedco

Infosys faces a partial setback in its dispute with Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (Tangedco) over electricity bill payment. The Madras High Court declined to stay a single judge's order directing Infosys to pay R 6.72 crore to Tangedco, and has asked the software giant to make an interim payment of Rs 2.5 crore within two weeks.The Madras High Court bench, comprising Acting Chief Justice R Mahadevan and Justice Mohammed Shaffiq, sided with Tangedco's arguments on the applicability of tariffs. While the full case is yet to be decided, the court direction to Infosys to make an interim payment of Rs 2.5 crore within two weeks puts pressure on Infosys and indicates that the court may lean towards upholding TNERC's tariff classifications.The final verdict will likely determine the total amount Infosys owes Tangedco and may set a precedent for similar disputes regarding electricity tariffs for IT companies with mixed use campuses.The crux of the dispute lies in the applicable electricity tariff for Infosys' unit at Mahindra World City near Chengalpet, in Chennai. Infosys argues that their unit should be classified under industrial tariff, which offers lower rates. However, Tangedco maintains that a portion of the electricity consumption falls under different categories due to the presence of BPO activities and commercial establishments on the campus.Infosys reportedly admitted to having BPO operations on its campus. Tangedco claims that for these activities, a higher ""Tariff III"" fixed by the Tamil Nadu Electricity Regulatory Commission (TNERC) should apply for the period 2009-2010.Tangedco argues that the presence of commercial establishments like food courts, banks, and clubs operating under separate trade names within the Infosys campus disqualifies them from industrial tariff benefits. TNERC's 2017 tariff regulations supposedly prohibit this.Infosys, represented by senior advocate Vijay Narayan, challenged the claims. They argued that:Tangedco's dues are barred by Section 56(2) of the Electricity Act, meaning the charges for BPO usage cannot be recovered.The amenities mentioned (food courts etc.) are meant for employee welfare and hence should qualify for concessional industrial tariff.Tangedco's senior counsel, P Wilson, countered these arguments stating:* TNERC has the statutory authority to fix electricity tariffs, and these rates are legally binding.* The limitation period for recovering dues is two years from the time they are recorded, which applies in this case.","Infosys faces a partial setback in its dispute with Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (Tangedco) over electricity bill payment.

Unusual battery drain: A sudden and significant decrease in battery life can indicate that malicious software is running in the background, consuming power.

Overheating: While some heating is normal during heavy usage, consistent overheating can be a sign of malware or spyware running on your device.

Increased data usage: Unexpected spikes in data usage may indicate that your phone is sending information to a third party without your knowledge.

Strange activity: If you notice unusual activities such as apps opening on their own, text messages you didn't send, or calls you didn't make, your phone might be compromised.

Pop-ups and ads: An influx of pop-up ads, especially when not using a browser, can be a sign of adware infection.

Unrecognised apps: If you find apps installed that you don't remember downloading, it could be a sign of unauthorised access.

Slow performance: A sudden drop in your phone's performance speed can be a result of malware hogging resources.

Unusual charges on your bill: Unexpected charges for premium services or international calls might indicate that a hacker is exploiting your phone.

Immediate actions to take if your phone is hacked

Disconnect from the internet: The first step is to disconnect your phone from the internet to stop any data transfer. Turn off Wi-Fi and mobile data immediately.

Enable aeroplane mode: Switch your phone to aeroplane mode to cut off all communication signals, preventing further access by the hacker.

Check and remove suspicious apps: Go through your installed apps and delete any that seem suspicious or that you don’t remember installing.

Change passwords: Using another device, change the passwords for all your important accounts, including email, social media, and banking apps. Ensure that the new passwords are strong and unique.

Install and run security software: Install reputable mobile security software and run a full scan to detect and remove any malware or spyware.

Update your phone’s OS and apps: Ensure your phone’s operating system and apps are up-to-date. Updates often include security patches that fix vulnerabilities.

Factory reset: If the problem persists, consider performing a factory reset. This will erase all data and settings, returning your phone to its original state. Make sure to back up important data before doing this.

Contact your service provider: Inform your mobile service provider about the issue. They can provide assistance and may have additional security measures to help protect your account.

Monitor your accounts: Keep a close eye on your bank and other important accounts for any suspicious activity and report it immediately.

Avoid public Wi-Fi: Public Wi-Fi networks can be insecure. Use a VPN if you need to access sensitive information over public Wi-Fi.

How Apple is trying to regain its position in China



Apple has achieved a new milestone in iPhone sales. As per data from Stocklytics.com (seen by Patently Apple), the Cupertino-based tech giant has about to reach the $2 trillion mark in iPhone's lifetime sales. This achievement comes after a recent decline in market share due to competition from Chinese brands like Xiaomi and Huawei.Since its introduction in 2007, this has been Apple’s most successful product as the company keeps updating its smartphones with new models and features.As per Statista data, Apple grossed $78.7 billion from iPhone sales within five years after releasing the first mode. Two years later, in FY 2014, this figure jumped to $101.9 billion and continued rising.The tech giant experienced several challenging years, especially in 2019 and 2020 when consumers worldwide reduced their spending budgets amid the pandemic. The report alsoclaims that iPhone sales have doubled and hit record highs in 2022 and 2023.During those two years, Apple grossed over $405 billion from selling iPhones, the highest figures in its history. Despite the revenue figures dropping slightly in the second quarter of FY 2024, iPhone sales remain strong. Statistics show Apple grossed $115.6 billion from iPhone sales in H1 FY 2024, pushing its lifetime revenue to a whopping $1.95 trillion.In Q1 FY 2009, Apple’s iPhone sales also accounted for about a quarter of Apple’s total revenue. Since then, this figure has more than doubled and hit 50.64% in Q1 2024.China is one of the biggest iPhone markets for Apple. According to a report by Counterpoint, Apple’s iPhone sales declined by more than 19% as Huawei saw 70% year-on-year growth in its smartphone sales in the country.To increase iPhone sales in China, Apple reportedly launched an aggressive discounting campaign on its official Tmall website in China in May. With these discounts, the company aims to fight off growing competition from local brands like Huawei. The latest discounts were steeper than those offered earlier this year.","Apple grossed $115.6 billion from iPhone sales in H1 FY 2024, pushing its lifetime revenue to a whopping $1.95 trillion.

Countries where WhatsApp is banned

Why these countries have banned WhatsApp?

WhatsApp bans 80 lakh accounts in India in March 2024

Apple removed Meta ’s WhatsApp from its App Store in China last month. The company then complied with China’s internet regulator’s – Cyberspace Administration order. In April this year, WhatsApp filed a plea with the Delhi high court to challenge India's 2021 IT rules for social media intermediaries, ‘threatening’ to leave the country if asked to break end-to-end-encryption.However, it is not only China where WhatsApp faces restrictions. Despite over 2 billion users worldwide, the social media app is banned in many countries. Although there are some workarounds like using VPN and other tools to overcome these restrictions, but not everyone is willing to take this extra step.Coming back to the number of countries where WhatsApp is banned or faces restrictions, there are 6 in total. These are China, North Korea, Iran, Qatar, Syria and United Arab Emirates (UAE).China has barred the use of foreign messaging apps like WhatsApp for years due to the “Great Wall”' restrictions. This has resulted in other messaging platforms like WeChat and Weibo dominating the Chinese market. Similarly, North Korea, which has one of the most restrictive national policies, does not allow its citizens to use WhatsApp or any other major messaging app used globally.Other countries that have banned WhatsApp include Iran, Syria, Qatar and United Arab Emirates (UAE). Syria and Iran have banned WhatsApp to regulate the information flow in the war-torn country. The UAE, on the other hand, has blocked WhatsApp voice and video calls to promote local telecommunication companies. Qatar too has blocked WhatsApp calls, but allows its citizens to send text messages over the app.In another news, WhatsApp said that it has banned more than 7.9 million accounts in India between March 1 to March 31, 2024. Releasing its latest monthly report, the platform said that 1,430,000of these accounts were proactively banned, before any reports from users.The report was published under the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021.","Despite over 2 billion users worldwide, the social media app is banned in many countries.

While staying comfortable during hot weather is essential, it doesn't have to come at the cost of soaring electricity bills. By implementing strategic energy-saving practices, you can reduce your summer electricity expenses without sacrificing comfort.Here you can explore several effective ways to save on summer electricity bills, offering practical tips and strategies that can help you minimise energy consumption and lower your utility costs during the warmer months. From optimising your cooling system to adopting energy-efficient habits, these recommendations are designed to make a noticeable impact on your electricity expenses while keeping your home cool and comfortable.Let's delve into these actionable tips that can help you save money and energy throughout the summer season.The Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) issues BEE Star Labels as a voluntary method for manufacturers to indicate an appliance's energy efficiency. The label uses stars to indicate the efficiency of a product, with more stars indicating higher efficiency. Simply put, the higher the energy efficiency rating of the appliance, the lower its energy consumption. To effectively reduce your home's energy costs, opt for appliances with a 5-star BEE rating. Not only does this positively impact the environment, but it also helps lower your electricity bills. Explore Crompton's wide range of 5-star rated ceiling fans to learn more about BEE Rating Appliances.If your home still uses CFLs and incandescent bulbs, it's time to replace them with LED bulbs. LED bulbs are not just a trendy choice; they are recognized for their energy efficiency and superior illumination. If you're wondering how to reduce your electricity bill at home, switching to LED bulbs is the solution for you.Upgrading to smart appliances is a highly effective method to decrease electricity consumption at home. These devices allow you to automate tasks and manage energy usage efficiently. Consider installing energy-efficient ceiling fans to further reduce electricity consumption. Smart appliances typically come equipped with remote control capabilities, allowing you to schedule operations and conserve power. Crompton offers remote-controlled fans designed for enhanced energy savings and lower power consumption.These energy-efficient fans are gaining popularity due to their brushless direct current motors (BLDC), which operate on direct current electricity. They can help save up to 60% on electricity compared to normal induction motor-based fans. Additionally, they offer convenient features like remote control for turning the fan on and off, timer functionality, and compatibility with voice assistants. To learn more about the differences between BLDC fans and normal fans and how they can help reduce electricity bills, explore further information on BLDC fans versus conventional fans.Implementing a full solar power system for your home can be a substantial investment. However, there are more accessible and cost-effective ways to leverage solar energy. Installing outdoor solar lights in your balcony and garden, along with solar fans, can notably reduce your energy expenses at a modest cost. Additionally, using solar pumps for daily tasks can contribute to electricity savings. It's beneficial to understand the distinction between an electric geyser and a solar geyser to make an informed choice for your energy needs.Maintain your air conditioner at 24 degrees Celsius to optimise cooling and conserve energy during the summer months, effectively lowering electricity costs. Additionally, using a timer to automate AC operation and upgrading to a 5-star BEE-rated model can further enhance energy efficiency and reduce expenses associated with cooling your space.Numerous advanced smart energy metres are currently offered in the market. These metres typically use Wi-Fi connectivity to monitor overall power usage within a home and provide real-time analysis of consumption patterns. Additionally, they can detect power leaks and identify high-energy-consuming appliances. Wi-Fi LED bulbs represent an excellent choice for reducing electricity usage.Regularly servicing and maintaining your home appliances is essential for optimal functionality and efficiency. Appliances that are not properly maintained are known to consume excessive energy, so routine maintenance can prolong their lifespan and reduce energy consumption. Learn more about the importance of cleaning exhaust fans.Install a power strip if you have several electronic devices or appliances that need to be plugged into a single electrical outlet. This allows you to easily turn off all devices at once when they are not in use, preventing unnecessary energy consumption often referred to as ""phantom"" energy loss.One of the simplest and most effective methods to lower electricity costs is by turning off electrical devices such as lights, fans, and air conditioners when they are not in use.","During summer months, many households experience a significant increase in electricity consumption due to higher cooling needs.
