"What two of the world’s largest chip companies, ASML and TSMC, may do if China attacks Taiwan",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/what-two-of-the-worlds-largest-chip-companies-asml-and-tsmc-may-do-if-china-attacks-taiwan/articleshow/110402247.cms,"ASML and TSMC , the world's leading chipmakers , can remotely disable their most advanced chipmaking machines should China invade Taiwan. Sources familiar with the matter told Bloomberg that this "" kill switch "" feature is designed to address the growing concerns over the potential ramifications of a Chinese takeover of Taiwan , which plays a crucial role in the global semiconductor industry.Bloomberg's sources said the Netherlands-based company ASML, which supplies extreme ultraviolet (EUV) machines to chipmaking giants like Taiwan's TSMC, has assured Dutch officials of its capability to shut down these machines remotely during meetings discussing the threat of a Chinese invasion. The Dutch government has even run simulations to assess the risks associated with such a scenario.EUV machines cost over $200 million each and are essential for producing the world's most advanced processor chips. TSMC alone is estimated to manufacture 90% of these cutting-edge chips, making Taiwan the epicentre of the semiconductor industry. A Chinese invasion of the island nation would severely affect the global economy.The revelation of the ""kill switch"" feature comes amidst heightened tensions between the United States and China. Washington imposed restrictions on Beijing's access to advanced AI chips from American manufacturers. The US has also pressured the Netherlands to block some ASML exports to China to limit the country's ability to produce advanced chips.While TSMC is diversifying its production with new facilities in Arizona, Japan, and Germany, these plants will take time to become operational. The US is also taking steps to boost domestic chip manufacturing through the CHIPS Act, which provides billions of dollars in subsidies. However, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has stated that the world's tech sector is likely to remain dependent on Taiwanese manufacturing for the foreseeable future.","ASML and TSMC can remotely disable their most advanced chipmaking machines should China invade Taiwan.

How hackers are stealing user details by faking China's biggest online shopping platform Shein,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-hackers-are-stealing-user-details-by-faking-chinas-biggest-online-shopping-platform-shein/articleshow/110406225.cms,"What method hackers use to scam people

How to spot fake emails

What users can do

Do not click on links from websites whose address isn't the official one and check the email's source.

Check the address of the website and the sender's name for spelling and punctuation errors on websites that look real.

Ensure the email is free of spelling errors. Pay attention to the language in the email. Question yourself whether you are expecting a package from Shein.

Shein is one of the most popular shopping apps in the world with reportedly the second most downloaded shopping app globally, with over 251 million downloads. This popularity has given hackers an opportunity to steal user data by offering fake discounts from China's biggest online shopping website, a report has indicated.According to Check Point, researchers from Harmony Email have said that hackers are impersonating Shein in an effort to steal user credentials, and over the last month, they have identified more than 1,000 of these fraudulent emails.Hackers send an email with a tempting subject line: ""Order Verification SHEIN"" – claiming to be from Shein customer service. However, the sender’s email address doesn't match Shein's official one.The email announces that the user has received a mystery box from Shein and asks users to click the provided link to claim a surprise gift. However, the link leads to a fake website designed to steal personal information.Just like other phishing attempts, scammers are trying to capitalise on popular brands and current trends to trick users – this time, they're using Shein.There are several red flags that users can notice when they receive such emails. Any email that shows a strong sense of urgency surrounding the ""mystery box"" offer and provides a link to claim the prize is likely a scam.A closer look at the email address may suggest users of a fake ID which has been created to fool people into clicking a link that takes them to a credential harvesting website.","Shein is one of the most popular shopping apps in the world with 251 million downloads.

How Nvidia is planning to compete with Huawei in China’s AI chip race,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-nvidia-is-planning-to-compete-with-huawei-in-chinas-ai-chip-race/articleshow/110405385.cms,"The chip war: Nvidia H20 vs Huawei Ascend 910B

Nvidia is reportedly reducing the price of its most recent AI chip designed for China. According to a report by news agency Reuters, this is due to the slow start of these AI chips and increased competition in the country.Citing people familiar with the situation, the report said that there are many chips available in China, forcing Nvidia to lower the price below a competing chip made by Huawei .Last year, the company introduced three new chips designed specifically for China after US sanctions stopped them from selling their most advanced chips there.The H20 is the most important of these chips because it is the most powerful Nvidia product sold in China. However, three sources in the supply chain told Reuters that there are many H20 chips available, which suggests weak demand.This has led to H20 chips being sold at a discount of more than 10% in some cases compared to Huawei's Ascend 910B , the most powerful AI chip made by a Chinese company, according to two of the three sources.Notably, Huawei began to challenge Nvidia last year and the sources have said the company will increase its shipments of its Ascend 910B chip this year, which are claimed to outperform the H20 in some key metrics.As per analysts the H20's performance will be a major factor for Nvidia’s business in China, while longer-term prospects will depend on how it competes with home-grown tech giant Huawei.Additionally, the US sanctions on AI chip exports, along with more competition has purportedly created uncertainty about Nvidia's future in China, a market that provided 17% of the company's revenue in fiscal year 2023, the report noted.The US implemented sanctions to restrict China's technological advancement. These sanctions prevent Nvidia from selling their H800, A800, H100, and B100 chips to China.","N Nvidia is reportedly reducing the price of its most recent AI chip designed for China.

Tower Semiconductor

The government has asked Israel's Tower Semiconductor to rework its proposal for setting up a chip fabrication unit in India. The Indian government reportedly it wants the Israeli company to onboard a technology partner that has “better technology and can offer advanced nodes” for manufacturing.“We are not entirely happy with the proposal they have submitted. The expert committee (India Semiconductor Mission or ISM) has informed them of that and wants them to bring partners in the 28, 40, 55 and 65 nm (nanometre) nodes instead of just the 180 nm proposal plan they have currently,” a government official told Economic Times.The electronics and information technology ministry wants companies to keep the 28 nm node for chip fabrication as the “baseline” and then move up the value chain to advanced nodes, according to officials.“We have also asked them (Tower Semiconductor) to provide details of the proposed uptake for their finished product as the demand for 180 nm and above analogue nodes is on the decline globally,” said another official.The Israeli chip fabrication firm has submitted a $8-10 billion proposal to set up a unit in India. If successful, it could be among the largest units for the company, which has seven manufacturing facilities spread across its home country Israel, the US, Japan, Italy and New Mexico. All of these units manufacture integrated chips in the 150 nm and above nodes. Tower Semiconductor did not respond to ET’s queries on the development.ET had earlier reported that the company was facing legal challenges in India following the fallout of its joint venture with Abu Dhabi-based Next Orbit Ventures. The Tower-ISMC joint venture was among the first proposals vying for incentives under the $10 billion India Semiconductor Mission, which provides a flat 50% incentive to semiconductor fabrication units, assembly, testing, marking, and packaging (ATMP) as well as for outsourced assembly and testing units.",The government has asked Israel's Tower Semiconductor to rework its proposal for setting up a chip fabrication unit in India.

The AI PC era is here with Microsoft Copilot+ PCs with Windows 11. Alongside the new ARM-based PCs, Microsoft has announced a host of new AI-powered features that require at least 40 TOPs of AI performance to run.Here we’ve explained all the new AI-powered features that Microsoft has announced as a part of the entire Copilot+ PC with Windows 11.Windows 10 debuted with a feature called Timeline.The feature was aimed at keeping a record of everything that users have done on their PC in last couple of days. From accessing a file to websites, apps, software and whatnot. However, Microsoft nuked the feature only to bring it back as “Recall” with the power of AI that does everything Timeline used to do, but better and more efficiently.Recall is a powerful feature designed to help you find and revisit anything users have seen or done on their PC. It acts like a photographic memory, capturing and organising your digital activities so you can easily locate information without remembering exact file locations or details.Recall continuously records your screen, capturing snapshots of your activities across all applications, websites, documents, and more. It builds a personal semantic index based on your interactions, which is stored locally on your device to ensure privacy. You can interact with Recall using natural language, and it will search through your recorded data to find what you need.Cocreator allows users to combine ink strokes with text prompts to generate images in real-time. Leveraging Neural Processing Units (NPUs) and local language models, it iterates on the artwork, providing high-quality outputs with powerful diffusion-based algorithms. Users can adjust the creativity slider to range from literal to expressive styles and continue refining their artwork effortlessly.This new AI feature makes photo editing easier and simpler for users by allowing them to apply preset styles such as Cyberpunk or Claymation to their photos. Users can transform backgrounds, foregrounds, or entire images and get visual inspiration for their creative projects. On Copilot+ PCs, users can generate, fine-tune, and save endless images quickly.Microsoft has announced DaVinci Resolve Studio now features NPU-accelerated Magic Mask for applying visual effects, while CapCut uses Auto Cutout for instant video background removal. These enhancements streamline video editing and content creation processes.Cephable introduces faster adaptive input controls using head movements or facial expressions, thanks to NPU-powered camera pipelines. LiquidText provides smarter on-device AI annotations, ensuring data privacy by keeping processing local.This feature translates any audio passing through a PC into English subtitles in real-time, supporting over 40 languages and working offline. It's available across all Copilot+ PCs, ensuring accessibility and understanding in global communications.Microsoft has announced new and improved features including Portrait Light for better illumination, creative filters like illustrated and watercolour, Eye Contact Teleprompter, and enhancements to voice focus and portrait blur, all aimed at improving video call quality.Every Copilot+ PC includes Copilot, an advanced AI agent that offers natural voice conversations using the latest AI models, including GPT-4o. This personal AI assistant is designed for ease of use, with a dedicated Copilot key on keyboards for quick access.","Recall is a powerful feature designed to help you find and revisit anything users have seen or done on their PC.

Apple may bring iPhone 16 series in two new colours: Details,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/mobiles-tabs/apple-may-bring-iphone-16-series-in-two-new-colours-details/articleshow/110260524.cms,"

Pro models may get a new Rose colour

Apple

may rename existing colours

Apple iPhone 16 series launch is months away. But the rumour mill is buzzing with expected features, design and now colour of the 2024 iPhone lineup. Popular Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo says that the Cupertino-based company may add two new colours to the iPhone 16, replacing the existing ones.The information was shared by Kuo in a post on X, formerly Twitter .In the post, Kuo says that the Pro models - iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max could be offered in black, white or silver, gray or ""Natural Titanium,"" and an all-new rose. The existing iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max are offered in Black Titanium, White Titanium, Blue Titanium and Natural Titanium colours.Kuo reveals that the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus are expected to come in black, green, pink, blue and white colour variants. Apple may also rename previous colours as well, Kuo adds. For example, the existing white could be renamed to starlight. “Also, even if the colour name is the same as the existing model, it may look different”, he says.Earlier, Kuo said that the iPhone 16 Pro Max is expected to feature a new battery with better energy density, potentially enhancing battery life if Apple maintains the same battery size. According to Kuo, iPhone 16 Pro Max will reportedly see a substantial redesign of its battery, switching from an aluminium to a stainless steel casing. This shift not only increases the battery's energy density but also improves its structural integrity. While stainless steel is less effective at dissipating heat compared to aluminium, it offers stronger protection, which could be beneficial for the overall durability of the device.In a related news, display analyst Ross Young said that the display production for Apple iPhone 16 will begin next month. This is on schedule with the timing of last year’s iPhone 15 production and the 2024 iPhone series launch may follow the same timeline as last year.","Apple may add two new colours to the iPhone 16, replacing the existing ones.

‘Godfather of AI’ Geoffrey Hinton: “Very worried about AI taking lots of…”,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/godfather-of-ai-geoffrey-hinton-very-worried-about-ai-taking-lots-of/articleshow/110254770.cms,"Hinton concerned of ‘extinction-level threats emerging’

Hinton is against the use of AI technology in the military



Geoffrey Hinton , the software engineer who is often regarded as the “godfather of artificial intelligence” has said that he is “very worried” about the artificial intelligence technology “taking lots of mundane jobs”. He said that it will be on to the governments to deal with the impact of artificial intelligence ( AI ) on income inequality.Hinton, who worked at Google until last year, said that while AI will increase productivity and wealth, the money would go to the rich “and not the people whose jobs get lost and that’s going to be very bad for society”.He noted that the government will have to establish a universal basic income , which means that the government will have to pay all individuals a set basic salary regardless of their means.“I was consulted by people in Downing Street and I advised them that universal basic income was a good idea,” Hinton, who left Google to talk more freely about the dangers of unregulated AI, told BBC.Hinton previously said that some of the dangers of AI chatbots were “quite scary”. He is of the view that AI chatbots can become more intelligent than humans and may be exploited by “bad actors”.AI could “evolve to get the motivation to make more of itself” and can autonomously “develop a sub-goal of getting control”, pointing out evidence of large language models choosing to be deceptive.""My guess is in between five and 20 years from now there’s a probability of half that we’ll have to confront the problem of AI trying to take over,” he said.As per Hinton, this will lead to an “extinction-level threat” for humans because they may have “created a form of intelligence that is just better than biological intelligence… That's very worrying for us”.“What I’m most concerned about is when these can autonomously make the decision to kill people,"" he added.","Geoffrey Hinton, the ‘godfather of artificial intelligence’ has said that he is ‘very worried’ about the artificial intelligence technology “taking lots of mundane jobs’ Hinton said that while AI will increase productivity and wealth, the money would go to the rich “and not the people whose jobs get lost”","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110254760,imgsize-126994,width-400,resizemode-4/110254760.jpg"

Phone condition: Assess the physical condition of the phone. Look for scratches, dents, or other signs of wear. Check the screen for cracks and ensure all buttons and ports function correctly.

Software updates: Ensure the phone is compatible with the latest software updates from the manufacturer. Older devices may not receive updates, which can impact security and functionality.

Network compatibility: Confirm that the mobile phone is unlocked or compatible with your network carrier. Some phones are locked to specific carriers, limiting your options.

IMEI check: Verify the phone's IMEI number to ensure it's not stolen or blacklisted. This step helps prevent buying a phone with legal issues or unpaid bills.

Performance testing: Test the phone's performance by running apps, browsing the internet, and checking the camera quality. Look for lagging or freezing issues.

Storage capacity: Determine the phone's storage capacity and assess whether it meets your needs for storing photos, videos, and apps.

Price comparison: Research the market value of the phone model you're interested in. Compare prices from different sellers to ensure you're getting a fair deal.

The film’s trailer opens with a striking scene of the Russian leader cowering on the floor in diapers, setting the tone for its controversial narrative.As per an ET report, Vega humorously recounted his approach: ""I called Putin and asked him if he wanted to play in my movie... No, that was a joke."" Despite the jest, the director utilised AI to generate Putin's face due to the lack of sufficient high-resolution images for a full-body deepfake. The results, according to early viewers, are uncannily realistic.""Putin"" chronicles the life of the Russian president over six decades, starting from his childhood at age 10, where he is depicted being beaten by his stepfather. The film culminates in a fictional portrayal of his death, which Vega describes as ""a happy end.""The concept for the biopic emerged during the early days of Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Initially, Vega aimed to make a film about the Russian mafia but shifted focus to what he considered ""the biggest gangster.""Despite potential risks, Vega dismisses fears of reprisals, boldly stating, ""Putin should be afraid of me."" The director's venture into AI has broader implications for the film industry, particularly in Hollywood, where the technology is both a boon and a source of concern. AI advancements threaten traditional roles, especially among special effects technicians and extras, raising fears of job losses.These concerns were central to last year's strike by actors and writers, culminating in an agreement that included compensation for the use of AI-generated likenesses. Despite apprehensions, AI is already extensively used in the industry. For example, it was employed to de-age Harrison Ford in the latest ""Indiana Jones"" film, though studios often refrain from publicising these uses.Beyond film production, AI's applications are expanding in various sectors of the media. The Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media, for instance, uses algorithms to analyse screenplays for gender and diversity biases. YouTube, a significant player in film promotion and distribution, has leveraged AI for over a decade, employing it for automated subtitles and copyright protections.Since April, YouTube has begun labelling AI-generated content and enhancing its detection programs. Justine Ryst, head of YouTube France, emphasised that ""AI isn't going to take over creation. It's going to simplify the complex, and make possible the impossible."" She advocated for a balance between innovation and responsibility in utilising AI.","Polish director Patryk Vega unveiled his latest project, a biopic titled ""Putin,"" featuring an AI-generated deepfake of Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Watch: Sam Altman shares how he spent the 4-and-a-half days he was sacked as ChatGPT maker OpenAI CEO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/watch-sam-altman-shares-how-he-spent-the-four-and-a-half-days-he-was-sacked-as-chatgpt-maker-openai-ceo/articleshow/110203159.cms,"Sam Altman talks GPT-4o and Predicts the Future of AI

The big lesson learnt

Sam Altman , CEO of OpenAI , has been on a rollercoaster the last few years. Since the company's release of ChatGPT, he's widely regarded as the poster boy of Generative-AI world. He's met with world leaders, clashed with Elon Musk , and even joined the billionaire club. Amidst all this, he also got fired (briefly) from the company he co-founded.On a recent tech podcast ""The Logan Bartlett Show"", Altman said with a laugh that if he had more time to reflect, ""every day would have something crazy."" However, one truly surreal moment stands out: His four-day ousting from OpenAI.As reported by Business Insider, it wasn't the firing itself that was unreal. It was how he handled this bizarre situation. Altman described it as an ""insane, superjammed"" 4 ½ days where his body was in an ""adrenaline-charged state.""Within a day of being fired, world leaders started texting. He received messages from 10-20 presidents and prime ministers. He said it felt normal at the time, and he even thanked them without batting an eye.""It was just weird,"" Altman admitted. He barely slept or ate, but his focus and energy were off the charts.Once he got his job back, reality hit him. Stopping at a diner, he realized he hadn't eaten in days. Naturally, he celebrated with a feast: four ""heavy"" meals and two milkshakes (just for him!).The celebratory meal was great, but the real shocker came later. A president texted him, relieved things were settled.Suddenly, Altman realized how bizarre it all was. World leaders texting him during his firing shouldn't have felt normal, but it did. It showed him just how adaptable humans are.""We can get used to anything as the new normal, good or bad, pretty fast,"" Altman said. He sees this as a strength – humans can adapt to almost anything.""My takeaway is human adaptability to almost anything is just, like, much more remarkably strong than we realize,"" Altman said on the podcast. ""And you can get used to anything as the new normal, good or bad, pretty fast.""","Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, has been on a rollercoaster the last few years.
