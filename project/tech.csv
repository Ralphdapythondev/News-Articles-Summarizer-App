Uber adds Concurrent Rides' feature: What it is and how it may solve this key problem many users face,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/uber-adds-concurrent-rides-feature-what-it-is-and-how-it-may-solve-this-key-problem-many-users-face/articleshow/112123585.cms,"What it means for users

Uber is expanding its services in India and is rolling out a new feature that allows users to book up to three rides simultaneously, a report has said. The feature, already available in several global markets, will reportedly be rolled out gradually across India.According to a report by TechCrunch, Uber has not specified which Indian cities will initially offer the concurrent rides feature.“As we understand that one may need to book a ride for their loved one at the same time as they are in an Uber — we launched concurrent rides late last year globally. It allows riders to book and track up to three concurrent rides,” an Uber spokesperson told TechCrunch.At the time of writing, the concurrent rides feature was not rolled out for Time of India Tech team members.The new feature is purportedly aimed at capturing a wider customer base, especially those without smartphones. This means that the guest rider will not need to have the Uber app to book a ride.Those with Uber accounts can now book rides for friends or family members and share trip details via WhatsApp or text message. The message contains the driver’s full name, cab model and registration number, Uber’s contact number to reach the driver, a link to track the ride, and a four-digit PIN to start the ride.Uber has allowed booking rides for someone else for some time now but this has been restricted to one user. For payments, the one who has booked can pay via the app or the rider can pay the driver via cash. Similarly, in the concurrent rides feature, all multiple riders can pay the driver in cash or via the app.Notably, the move positions Uber ahead of its competitor, Ola, which currently allows two rides at a time with limited payment options.It does not allow users to make two bookings at same time using a single online payment method, which means the one who is booking must either choose two different online payment methods or pay via cash.","Uber is rolling out a new feature that allows users to book up to three rides simultaneously.

What is available in developer beta 1

While the initial release of iOS 18.1 brought some highly anticipated Apple Intelligence features , many of the most promising capabilities are still absent from the beta version.

Ola quits Google Maps in favour of Ola Maps

MapMyIndia parent company CE Info Systems has sued Ola Electric, alleging that the ride-hailing giant Ola has copied its data and reverse engineered the licensed product. It said that Ola cached and saved MapMyIndia's data.CE Info Systems in a legal document, which has been accessed by Forbes India, claims that Ola's actions violate the terms of the 2021 agreement and have caused significant harm to its business.It also says that co-mingling and reverse engineering is prohibited in the agreement and under the Intellectual Property laws.Ola founder and CEO Bhavish Aggarwal, when asked about the legal notice at IPO press conference, said. “This isn't the right place to talk about it (legal notice). It is not part of the IPO discussion.”The development comes a few weeks after Ola founder and CEO Bhavish Aggarwal announced that the ride-hailing platform is moving away from Google Maps and the company’s fleet will now use Ola Maps.“After Azure exit last month, we’ve now fully exited Google Maps. We used to spend Rs 100 crore a year, but we’ve made that 0 this month by moving completely to our in-house Ola Maps,” Aggarwal said in a post on X.After Google announced price cuts in Maps APIs, Aggarwal slammed Google saying, “Reducing prices for @googlemaps, “offering to price in ₹” after #ExitGoogleMaps. Don’t need your fake generosity!” He then posted a “response to @googlemaps ‘belated’ price cuts” announcing a further reduced pricing structure for Ola Maps.","MapMyIndia parent company CE Info Systems has sued Ola Electric, alleging that the ride-hailing giant Ola has copied its data.

Apple fixes iCloud Private Relay affecting Safari browser on iPhones after outage,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-fixes-icloud-private-relay-affecting-safari-browser-on-iphones-after-outage/articleshow/112111267.cms,"Apple iCloud Private Relay service outage: How was it affecting users



What is Apple’s iCloud Private Relay service







Apple has fixed the iCloud Private Relay service outage and has reportedly restored complete functionality for users globally after days of disruption. According to a report by MacRumors, the Cupertino-based tech giant has now resolved the issue with the iCloud Private Relay service. Those who disabled ‌iCloud‌ Private Relay to avoid browsing issues can now re-enable the feature to continue benefiting from its privacy features.The recent iCloud Private Relay outage started last week and has now been resolved.This issue affected web browsing for some users for over 48 hours. Earlier, Apple confirmed the problem on its System Status webpage, noting that the service may have been slow or unavailable during that time.Some iPhone users were reportedly facing problems with the Safari browser not working properly due to this outage. Multiple reports on social media indicated that people were having problems with iPhone Safari becoming stuck when they type in a search request or website.A user named Madhu Singh took to micro-blogging site X (earlier Twitter) to share a video to show how the issue was affecting the Safari browser on iPhone:While the extent of the problem was unknown, some affected users also reported being successful in resolving the issue by toggling iCloud Private Relay off and on or restarting their iPhones.This wasn’t the first outage for Apple’s iCloud Private Relay. In 2022, users faced an incident that affected the entire iCloud suite.iCloud Private Relay is a feature for iCloud+ subscribers that enhances privacy by encrypting browsing data and routing it through two separate relay servers. One server is operated by Apple, and the other by a third party.This dual-server setup ensures that neither Apple, internet service providers, nor visited websites can access users' true browsing information. By separating the user's IP address from their DNS queries, the dual-relay mechanism further obscures online activity, maintaining an improved level of privacy.","The recent iCloud Private Relay outage started last week and has now been resolved.

The tech giant is rolling out a new tool that simplifies the process of hiding individuals from appearing in Memories.As reported by Android Authority, Google is now making it easier to hide faces in Google Photos.Previously, users had to navigate through multiple menus to exclude specific people from their photo retrospectives. The new update promises a more streamlined approach, allowing users to directly hide a face from a photo's details page. This change is expected to make the process quicker and more intuitive.While Google hasn’t officially announced a release date for the new feature, it’s anticipated to be available to users in the coming months. This update comes as a welcome relief for many users who have expressed frustration over seeing unwanted faces in their Memories.To hide individuals from Memories in Google Photos, navigate to the app's settings menu, then go to Preferences > Memories, and select ""Hide people and pets."" This action will enable you to conceal individuals from appearing in your memories, creations, or on the search page without deleting any of the photos they are in.The report mentions that Google has simplified this process by reducing the number of steps. As per the APK teardown users will have to now open a photo and swipe to Metadata. After this, they just have to tap on three dots in the People section and tap on the hide face option. Users can choose to either reduce the frequency of a person's appearance or completely block them from showing up in any photo memories.","Google Photos is making a significant upgrade to its Memories feature, giving users more control over which faces appear in their nostalgic photo collages.

Anand Mahindra said that artificial intelligence (AI) can be of more value to mankind than ‘imagined’. Citing a research that showed how AI can detect breast cancer five years before it develops, he wrote ""If this is accurate, then AI is going to be of significantly more value to us than we imagined and much earlier than we had imagined,"".The Mahindra Group chairman took to microblogging platform X (formerly known as Twitter) to share his views.Recently, a team of researchers from Duke University in the US developed a new AI model to predict 5-year breast cancer risk from mammograms.Traditional cancer diagnosis relies on biopsies, microscopic histological examinations, and imaging techniques like MRI, CT, and PET scans. Human interpretation of these tests can be subjective. AI, on the other hand, can analyse medical images with staggering accuracy.An IANS report quotes Vineet Nakra, a radiation oncologist at Max Super Speciality Hospital on how AI is helping in cancer diagnosis and treatment. She told the news agency that AI is helping pathologists diagnose cancer much faster and paving the way for doctors to make personalised and patient-centric cancer care.Commenting on Mahindra’s X post, a user wrote “That's the best use of technology anyway. Assisting human kind to become better and reduce risks”. “AI in the medical field will have a huge impact and will certainly make significant contributions. Google DeepMind's AI system, AlphaFold3, can accurately predict the 3D structure of proteins and has potential applications in drug discovery and understanding diseases,” commented another.“AI, Machine Learning, Big data analysis based systems will drastically improve the living standards of life of every strata of society,” replied a third.","The Mahindra Group chairman took to microblogging platform X to share his views. He cited a research that showed how AI can detect breast cancer five years before it develops. Traditional cancer diagnosis relies on biopsies, microscopic histological examinations, and imaging techniques like MRI, CT, and PET scans.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112095975,imgsize-68790,width-400,resizemode-4/112095975.jpg"

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has reduced the basic customs duty on mobile phones, chargers, and some components as part of the Union Budget 2024, addressing a major demand from the electronics manufacturing industry. Currently, imported smartphones sold in India are subject to 18% GST and 22% customs duty (20% basic and 2% surcharge). The 10% surcharge on the basic customs duty will remain unchanged.Following the reduction, the total customs duty is now 16.5% (15% basic and 1.5% surcharge). For phones manufactured in India, only the 18% GST is applied. Apple imports its iPhone Pro and Pro Max models, while its other smartphones are produced locally.Post this announcement, Apple has reduced prices of iPhones in India. While the price cut on base models non-Pro is almost negligible at Rs 300, the cut on high end Pro models is up to Rs 6,000. Here are the new prices of iPhones as they appear on Apple's official store in India.Apple has already updated its website with the new prices of the iPhone.

CrowdStrike outage: Microsoft now wants to keep away the access of Windows Kernel from these companies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/crowdstrike-outage-microsoft-now-wants-to-keep-away-the-access-of-windows-kernel-from-these-companies/articleshow/112057428.cms,"Microsoft is advocating for significant changes to Windows security architecture in the wake of a major outage caused by a faulty CrowdStrike update last week. The incident, which affected 8.5 million PCs, has prompted Microsoft to reassess the resilience of its operating system and consider limiting kernel-level access for third-party security vendors .John Cable, Microsoft's vice president of program management for Windows servicing and delivery, outlined the company's stance in a blog post titled ""Windows resiliency: Best practices and the path forward."" Cable emphasised the need for ""end-to-end resilience"" and hinted at potential changes that could restrict kernel access for security software.The CrowdStrike update bug, which resulted in widespread system crashes, has highlighted the risks associated with allowing third-party applications to operate at the kernel level. This privileged access, while beneficial for threat detection, can lead to catastrophic failures if errors occur.Microsoft is now exploring alternatives that don't rely on kernel access, such as VBS enclaves and the Azure Attestation service. These technologies, which utilize Zero Trust approaches, could provide enhanced security without the risks associated with kernel-level operations.The tech giant's push for change may face resistance from cybersecurity vendors and regulators. A similar attempt to restrict kernel access in Windows Vista in 2006 was met with opposition. In contrast, Apple successfully locked down kernel access in macOS in 2020.Microsoft's approach involves collaboration with partners and the broader security community. The company aims to balance improved system resilience with the needs of security vendors who have historically relied on kernel-level access for their products.Microsoft's response to the CrowdStrike incident also included deploying over 5,000 support engineers to assist affected organizations and providing ongoing updates through the Windows release health dashboard. The company has emphasized the importance of business continuity planning, secure data backups, and utilizing cloud-native approaches for managing Windows devices to enhance resilience against future incidents.",CrowdStrike update last week resulted in widespread system crashes.

SearchGPT in testing phase right now

What OpenAI said about SearchGPT

OpenAI to take on Microsoft Bing and Perplexity, along with Google

SearchGPT may look like Google Overview

(With agency inputs)

OpenAI is testing an artificial intelligence-powered search engine that can access information from across the internet in real time. The prominent AI startup revealed the new prototype, SearchGPT , in a blog post earlier this week. OpenAI plans to integrate its new search engine technology with its existing online chatbot, ChatGPT. In a blog post, Microsoft-backed OpenAI said that the company plans to integrate the best features from the search tool into ChatGPT in the future.Here are the key things to know about SearchGPT.The company said it was testing the technology with a small group of users as well as online publishers who partnered with OpenAI to help build the search engine.“Getting answers on the web can take a lot of effort, often requiring multiple attempts to get relevant results,” the company said in its blog post. “We believe that by enhancing the conversational capabilities of our models with real-time information from the web, finding what you’re looking for can be faster and easier,” it added. Users will be able to interact with SearchGPT through conversational queries, and can ask follow-up questions as they might if speaking to a person, OpenAI said.Other than the search giant Google , SearchGPT launch, announced earlier this week, places the AI giant in competition with its largest backer Microsoft's Bing search and emerging services such as Perplexity — a search-focused AI chatbot firm backed by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and semiconductor giant Nvidia . According to web analytics firm Statcounter, Google dominates the search engine market with a 91.1% share as of June 2024.Google recently added AI-generated query result summaries -- referred to as ""Overviews"" -- to its search engine. This new feature offers written text at the top of results for Google searches, ahead of the traditional links to websites, which summarizes information that the engine believes answers the user's search query. The description shared by OPenAI of SearchGPT appears similar to Google's Overviews.","OpenAI is testing an artificial intelligence-powered search engine that can access information from across the internet in real time.

How X’s auto-consent flouts tech rules in the UK, EU

Elon Musk-owned X recently enabled by default a setting that allows the social media platform to utilise user data to train its AI model, Grok. This means X can use user posts, interactions, and outputs from Grok for training and refining its AI, requiring users to manually opt-out. Now the regulators in the UK and the European Union ( EU ) have reportedly connected with the company over its alleged attempt to gain user consent for data harvesting without their approval.While X claims this data is essential for improving user experience, privacy concerns have been raised. The setting states that users “allow your posts as well as your interactions, inputs and results with Grok to be used for training and fine-tuning”.Users have expressed difficulty in disabling this feature as the option is currently hidden within the web app's settings and unavailable on the mobile app.The move contradicts the tech laws in both the regions as the regulations prohibit pre-ticked consent boxes. Tech companies are not allowed to use “pre-ticked boxes” or “any other method of default consent”.Data protection authorities in the UK and Ireland have expressed their concerns over X's actions, as per a report by the Guardian. The UK's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) is investigating the matter, emphasising the importance of transparency and user choice in data usage.“Platforms seeking to use their users’ data to train their AI foundation models must be transparent about their activities,” said a spokesperson for the ICO.“They should take steps to proactively notify users well in advance of using data for these purposes, and provide people with ample time and simple processes to object to having their data used in this way,” the spokesperson added.Similarly, Ireland's Data Protection Commission (DPC), the lead regulator for X in the EU, has expressed surprise at the development and is seeking further information from the company.“The DPC has been engaging with X on this matter for a number of months, with our latest interaction occurring as recently as yesterday, therefore we are surprised by today’s developments. We have followed up with X today (July 26) and are awaiting a response. We expect further engagement early next week,” said Graham Doyle, a DPC deputy commissioner.","X recently enabled by default a setting that allows the social media platform to utilise user data to train its AI model, Grok.

Karnataka reservation bill: PhonePe CEO and founder Sameer Nigam issues this 'personal statement',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/karnataka-reservation-bill-phonepe-ceo-and-founder-sameer-nigam-issues-this-personal-statement/articleshow/111908948.cms,"Read PhonePe CEO Sameer Nigam’s personal note

“PhonePe was born in Bengaluru and we are incredibly proud of our roots in this city, which is well known for its world-class technology talent and vibrant diversity. From Bengaluru, over the past decade we have expanded across the length and breadth of India and been able to deliver secure and efficient digital payments for over 55 Crore Indians.

Bengaluru's reputation as the ""Silicon valley of India"" is truly well-deserved. The city thrives on an incredible culture of innovation, and attracts the most brilliant young minds from Karnataka and the rest of India. As a company, we are deeply grateful for the supportive business environment that Karnataka’s governments and its local

Kannadiga

populace have offered us. Without such an inclusive ecosystem and progressive policies, Bengaluru would not have become a global technology superpower.

As a company we also thrive on celebrating diversity, we have always tried hard to deliver fair, unbiased and meritocracy-based employment opportunities for all Indians - including to all local Kannadigas. We believe such an approach gives every Indian a good job a chance to shine, and ultimately helps create more societal and economic value for Bengaluru, Karnataka and India.

I read some recent media articles, relating to a few personal comments that I made last week regarding the draft job reservation bill. I would first and foremost like to clarify that it was NEVER my intention to insult Karnataka and it’s people. If my comments hurt anyone’s sentiments in such a way, I am truly sorry and would like to offer you an unconditional apology. I have the highest regard for Kannada, and all other Indian languages. In fact, I truly believe that linguistic diversity and rich cultural heritage is a national asset that all Indians should be proud of; and all Indians should be respectful of and celebrate local and cultural norms.

Bengaluru’s Indian startups are competing against trillion dollar giants like Google, Apple, Amazon and Microsoft. To do so, these companies must be able to employ the very best talent available in India purely based on their technology skills and proficiency in fields such as Coding, Design, Product Management, Data Sciences, Machine Learning, AI and beyond. As a nation, that is the only way we can build world-class companies that can compete in the global village that we live in today.

I also want to help create lakhs of jobs for Bengaluru and Karnataka. And, I believe with more dialogue and discussion, we can find ways to create more sustainable employment avenues. Let’s all work together to do this meaningfully and while creating long-term impact.”

PhonePe CEO Sameer Nigam issued a personal note following backlash over his comments on Karnataka 's job reservation bill. The controversy erupted after Nigam criticised the bill on social media platform X, questioning whether his children deserved jobs in their home city given his company's pan-India job creation.""If my comments hurt anyone's sentiments, I am truly sorry and would like to offer you an unconditional apology,"" Nigam said in a statement.He emphasised his 22-year connection to Bengaluru and respect for linguistic diversity.The Karnataka Cabinet had recently approved a bill mandating 50% reservation for locals in management roles and 70% in non-management positions within private companies. The bill, which also proposed 100% quota for locals in certain government jobs, was put on hold after industry backlash.Nigam stressed the need for merit-based hiring to build globally competitive companies. He reaffirmed PhonePe's commitment to Karnataka, stating the company plans to create thousands of new jobs in the state.",PhonePe CEO Sameer Nigam issued a personal note following backlash over his comments on Karnataka's job reservation bill.
