"After Microsoft, Google issues warning on fake emails by Iranian hackers targeting US elections, Israel",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/after-microsoft-google-issues-warning-on-fake-emails-by-iranian-hackers-targeting-us-elections-israel/articleshow/112551952.cms,"Tactics used by Iranian hackers to target officials

Sending emails that appear to be from legitimate organisations, such as government agencies, banks, or social media companies.

Creating fake websites that look like the real websites of legitimate organisations.

Using social engineering techniques to trick users into clicking on malicious links or opening attachments.

Google 's Threat Analysis Group (TAG) has issued a warning about a rise in phishing campaigns by an Iranian government-backed group. This group, known as APT42 , is said to be targeting users in Israel as well as accounts associated with the US presidential election with credential phishing attacks.“Associated with Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), APT42 consistently targets high-profile users in Israel and the US, including current and former government officials, political campaigns, diplomats, individuals who work at think tanks, as well as NGOs and academic institutions that contribute to foreign policy conversations,” Google said in blog.It said that the US and Israel accounted for roughly 60% of APT42’s known geographic targeting in the last six months.Google says that APT42 uses a variety of different tactics as part of their email phishing attacks — a type of cybercrime where attackers attempt to trick users into revealing sensitive information, such as usernames and passwords.According to TAG, APT42 is using a variety of methods to carry out its phishing attacks. These methods include:“They generally try to abuse services like Google (i.e. Sites, Drive, Gmail, and others), Dropbox, OneDrive and others for these purposes,” Google noted.In the current US presidential election cycle, TAG detected and disrupted a phishing activity. In May and June, APT42 targets included the personal email accounts of roughly a dozen individuals affiliated with President Biden and with former President Trump.“Today, TAG continues to observe unsuccessful attempts from APT42 to compromise the personal accounts of individuals affiliated with President Biden, Vice President Harris and former President Trump, including current and former government officials and individuals associated with the campaigns,” Google noted.TAG is urging users to be vigilant and to be aware of the signs of phishing attacks.","Google has issued a warning about a rise in phishing campaigns by an Iranian government-backed group.

Former Google CEO 'regrets' these 'work from home' comments made on the company,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/former-google-ceo-regrets-these-work-from-home-comments-made-on-the-company/articleshow/112551829.cms,"What Schmidt told students at Stanford

Schmidt’s throws weight behind work-from-office policy

Eric Schmidt , former CEO and executive chairman at Google, made headlines after he told students at Stanford University that Google is losing the artificial intelligence (AI) race and that is because of its remote-work policies. He has now expressed regret over his remarks.“I misspoke about Google and their work hours. I regret my error,” Schmidt said in an email to The Wall Street Journal.In response to a question about Google competing with OpenAI , Schmitt blamed ' work from home ' as the reason for the tech giant “falling behind” in Al race.The video in which Schmidt criticised Google is not available for people and Schmidt reportedly said that he asked for the video to be taken down.While talking to students, Schmidt criticised Google's approach saying that the company’s decision of maintaining work-life balance has allowed startups like OpenAI and Anthropic to gain a significant edge in AI development.“Google decided that work-life balance and going home early and working from home was more important than winning. And the reason the startups work is because the people work like hell,” Schmidt said.Schmidt, who was the CEO of Google from 2001 to 2011, emphasised that a high-pressure environment is necessary for rapid innovation in the tech industry and suggested that remote work has diluted this intensity.“I'm sorry to be so blunt, but the fact of the matter is, if you all leave the university and go found a company, you're not going to let people work from home and only come in one day a week if you want to compete against the other startups,” Schmidt added.When Covid-19 was at its peak, the tech majors started work-from-home policy to keep the businesses running. As the world started to open up, companies started asking workers, who went back to their homes, to relocate and start coming to the office.Soon the option of work-from-office became a mandate and tech companies, including Google, took strict measures to bring its employees back to physical offices. The search giant now requires employees to work from the office at least three days a week. It is tracking employees' attendance and has made this as part of performance reviews.","Eric Schmidt, former CEO and executive chairman at Google, made headlines after he told students at Stanford University that Google is losing the artificial intelligence (AI) race.

The Securities and Exchange Board of India ( SEBI ) has proposed new regulations to govern the use of artificial intelligence (AI) by investment advisors and research analysts. The market regulator is keen on ensuring transparency and protecting investor interests as AI becomes increasingly prevalent in the financial sector .""The possibility of unintended data exposure highlights the need for strong security measures and clear disclosure to clients about the extent of AI tool usage"", Trivesh D, COO at Tradejini, a stock trading platform, told PTI.Under the proposed rules, investment advisors and research analysts will be required to disclose the extent of AI usage in their services to clients. This move aims to empower investors with information about how AI contributes to investment decisions.SEBI has expressed concerns over potential data security risks associated with AI tools. The regulator emphasizes the need for robust security measures to prevent unintended data exposure. While acknowledging the potential benefits of AI in enhancing efficiency and productivity, SEBI also points out that AI tools might not always provide comprehensive or accurate information.""These AI tools, however, may not adequately safeguard sensitive data shared during conversations, potentially leading to unintended data exposure and concerns related to data security,"" Sebi said in its consultation paper issued last recently.""An IA/RA who uses AI tools for servicing its clients must provide complete disclosure of the extent of use of such tools to its prospective clients, to enable them to take informed decisions of continuance or otherwise with the IA/RA,"" Sebi's consultation paper added.To further safeguard investor interests, SEBI is considering establishing a closed ecosystem for fee collection by registered investment advisors and research analysts.

Cognizant trolled for offering decade-low salary package

IT giant Cognizant is under fire for implementing minimal salary hikes and offering historically low starting salaries to freshers. Despite posting a quarterly profit increase, the company has drawn widespread criticism for its compensation policies.According to a report in Economic Times, Cognizant Technology Solutions is said to have handed out annual salary hikes as low as 1% to some of its employees.This comes as the US-based global technology services giant rolled out increments after deferring them by four months. The hikes are as low as 1% and the highest is said to be 5%, at least two people aware of the development told ET on the condition of anonymity.Employees who received performance ratings of 3 were granted salary hikes ranging from 1% to 3%, while those with ratings of 4 and 5 received hikes of 4% and 4.5-5% respectively. These figures represent a significant decline compared to the previous year's hikes of 7-11%.The US-based company has around 254,000 employees, or about 70% of its total employee headcount, in India. Cognizant reported a reduction in its total headcount by 8,100 to 336,300 during the quarter ended June. The employee count was lower by 9,300 from a year ago. In its second quarter ended June, Cognizant posted a 22.2% year-on-year (YoY) and 3.6% sequential growth in net profit at $566 million. Its revenue came in at $4.85 billion, marginally lower by 0.7% on year.The company has guided for Q3 revenue to be in the range of $4.89-4.96 billion, a minus 0.2% to +1.3% YoY or 0.0% and 1.5% YoY in constant currency terms.The controversy deepened as Cognizant announced starting salaries of Rs 2.52 lakh per annum for freshers, a level that some said is two-decades law and goes back to starting salary of 2002. This decision has sparked outrage on social media and raised concerns about the company's future talent acquisition strategy. Cognizant, in its job posting, said that the Rs 2.5-lakh package is for candidates graduating in the 2024 batch with any 3-year full-time degree programme who are eligible to apply.",Cognizant Technology Solutions is said to have handed out annual salary hikes as low as 1% to some of its employees.

Tensor G4, Gemini and more AI inside

Upgraded cameras with the new 'Add me' AI feature for photos

Google has launched its second-generation Pixel foldable phone, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold , which is its first-ever foldable phone in India. The second-gen Pixel Fold upgrades on some salient aspects over the first one. Per Google, the foldable is slim, super durable, and has a brighter screen, both on the outside and inside. And, the phone also packs in Pixel’s “fastest, most powerful” Tensor G4 chip , bringing on-device multimodal capabilities to the phone.On the inside, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold comes equipped with an 8 inches ‘Super Actua Flex display,’ an LTPO panel with a 2922x1344 resolution at 486 PPI. The inner screen has a dynamic refresh rate of 1-120Hz and can go as bright as 3,000 nits, which Google says is 80% brighter than the screen on the first-gen Pixel Fold. To make use of phone’s large inner canvas, there’s a split-screen mode that’ll let you use two apps side-by-side.When unfolded, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold can be used a regular phone with a 6.3 inches outer screen, which has the same specs as the inner screen.Google says that the Pixel 9 Pro Fold has an “all-new” hinge that is made from stainless steel and has an aerospace grade aluminium alloy cover. The hinge has a polished finish, while the back has the silky matt finish. The phone is rated IPX8 for water resistivity. And there’s Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the outside.Powering the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is Google’s Tensor G4 chip, also found on the other three Pixel 9 phones. The chip comes paired with 16GB of RAM and up to 1TB storage. Then, there’s theTitan M2 security coprocessor , which enables multi-layer hardware security.There’s a 5,060mAh battery, which Google promises will last for over 24 hours and up to 100 hours with Extreme Battery Saver. The phone supports fast charging at 45W, which should fill up the battery up to 55% in about 30 minutes. FYI, the charger isn’t included in the box. The phone also supports Qi wireless charging and Battery Share, i.e., reverse wireless charging.Out-of-the-box the Pixel 9 Pro Fold will come with Android 14 . There’s the usual Google promise of 7 years of OS and security updates.Would it even be a Pixel phone, if there’s no AI in it. Well, there’s a whole lot of AI. For starters Gemini is there, and it works in split-screen mode, as well. One could ask Gemini to write stuff or even get info about whats’s on the screen or photos. Circle To Search is also there, ohh and this feature can help you check if an image has been created using AI.The new “Pixel-exclusive” AI feature to arrive is Pixel Screenshots. The feature could organise or recall things, like events and location, all you need to is ask the phone.Google is giving one year of the Google One AI Premium plan for free to those who’ll buy the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. So, that’ll give you access to Gemini Advanced, Gemini in Gmail and Docs, on top of 2TB of cloud storage.The Pixel 9 Pro Fold ditches the camera visor for a squircle module that houses a triple lens setup – a 50MP wide camera, a 48MP ultraide and a 48MP 5x telephoto camera. For selfies, there's a 42 MP front-facing camera on the inner screen and 10MP camera on the outside.The camera hardware has been only a part of Pixel’s camera, but it’s AI that completes it. There’s a long list of AI features that complements the camera hardware on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. The usual Super Res Zoom, Zoom Enhance, Video Boost, Face Unblur, Photo Unblur, Best Take, Magic Eraser, Audio Eraser, and Magic Editor makes their return. Well, Magic Eraser now has an a “reimagine” feature that Google says can give photos a “whole new look.”One new AI tool to come to Google’s Pixel 9 pro Fold is the “Add Me,” which as you’d image can add you to a picture. So, how does it work? Well, you take photo with the group, swap in yourself, and AI will merge the photos.Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold is priced in India at Rs 1,72,999 and will be available for purchase later this year. While it comes in two colours – Obsidian and Porcelain – it’ll be available only in Obsidian colour in India.","Google has launched its second-generation Pixel foldable phone, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold.

Delta Airlines seeks compensation for disruption

In mounting problems for CrowdStrike over Microsoft outage last month, the cybersecurity company being sued by air travellers in a latest move. According to a Reuters report, air travellers whose flights were delayed or cancelled on July 19 due to Microsoft Windows outage on July 19 have filed a class action against the company.The plaintiffs include three fliers who filed the lawsuit in the federal court, Austin, Texas.They blame CrowdStrike's negligence in testing and deploying its software for the outage. Adding further, they stated that as fliers scrambled to get to their destinations, many spent hundreds of dollars on lodging, meals and alternative travel, while others missed work or suffered health problems from having to sleep on the airport floor.The filers demand CrowdStrike to pay compensatory and punitive damages to anyone whose flight was disrupted.In a statement, CrowdStrike said ""We believe this case lacks merit and we will vigorously defend the company."" The US cybersecurity company also provided an identical statement in response to a shareholder lawsuit filed on July 31.Delta claims that it faced over 2,200 flight cancellations on July 19 alone, with more than 6,000 flights cancelled since then. The airline is now dealing with over 176,000 refund or reimbursement requests. The estimated cost of the outages could reach as high as $500 million.The company’s CEO Ed Bastian said last week the outage had cost the airline $500 million, adding that it plans to take legal action to get compensation from the cybersecurity firm.Microsoft outage on July 19 was caused by a faulty software update that impacted 8 million Windows computers worldwide. CrowdStrike has rejected Delta Airlines' claim stating that it is ""highly disappointed by Delta's suggestion that CrowdStrike acted inappropriately and strongly rejects any allegation that it was grossly negligent or committed misconduct.""","Air travellers whose flights were delayed or cancelled on July 19 have filed a class action against CrowdStrike.

"Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange, gets Rs 722 crore GST from DGGI",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/dgci-sends-rs-722-crore-gst-notice-to-the-worlds-largest-crypto-exchange-binance/articleshow/112304561.cms,"In a groundbreaking move, the Ahmedabad zonal unit of the Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGGI) has issued a show cause notice to Binance , the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange , demanding Goods and Services Tax (GST) payment of Rs 722 crore. This marks the first time the DGGI has issued such a notice to a cryptocurrency firm, setting a significant precedent in India’s efforts to regulate the rapidly growing virtual currency market.Sources confirmed that the notice was issued to Binance for collecting fees from Indian customers trading in virtual digital assets (VDAs) on their platform, categorized under online information database access or retrieval (OIDAR) services.Earlier this year, Binance received approval from India’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) to register as a virtual asset service provider (VASP). However, the company was slapped with a Rs 18 crore penalty from the FIU last month for non-compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) regulations.Despite being a major player in the global cryptocurrency market, with at least 40% market share and operations across more than 150 countries, Binance had not registered under the Indian GST framework. This oversight has now brought the company under the scrutiny of Indian tax authorities.“Binance reportedly earned at least Rs 4,000 crore from transaction fees charged to Indian customers. The company has a user base of 90 million users globally, including a substantial number of customers from India too. Detailed investigation revealed that the earnings of these fees were credited to the account of a Binance Group Company — Nest Services Limited — based in Seychelles,” a top source privy to the development said.In fact, Binance is reportedly facing a trial in a Nigerian court for alleged tax evasion, following a crypto crackdown in the country.To make Binance compliant with the GST regulations, DGGI Ahmedabad zonal unit also sent emails to Binance group companies in Seychelles, the Cayman Islands and Switzerland, which did not elicit a response. Binance appointed a local counsel in India to liaise with the DGGI, marking the first step towards resolving this significant tax compliance issue.Sources confirmed that DGGI is also closely monitoring financial transactions and activities of online gaming platforms and marketplaces for the possibility of tax evasion.The Indian GST regime mandates that foreign service providers pay GST for services provided to Indian residents, particularly under the OIDAR category. As the investigation continues, other cryptocurrency exchanges operating both overseas and within India are also expected to face scrutiny from tax authorities, said sources.","The Ahmedabad zonal unit of the Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGGI) has issued a show cause notice to Binance.

The new offering promises lightning-fast 8-16 minute deliveries for a diverse range of products, spanning from groceries to electronics.With this move, Flipkart directly challenges established players in the booming quick commerce sector, including Swiggy's Instamart, Zomato's Blinkit , Zepto , and BigBasket's BB Now.The service, which was previously offered on a trial basis to employees at Flipkart's headquarters, is now available to users through the Flipkart app.We confirmed the service's availability by checking an address in HSR on the Flipkart app, which indeed showed Flipkart Minutes as an option for quick delivery. Additionally, several users on X (formerly Twitter) reported that Flipkart is delivering groceries and other items to their addresses in Bengaluru within minutes through the ""Minutes"" service.Sources familiar with the matter tell the Economic Times that Flipkart plans to expand the service to more areas in Bengaluru over the next few weeks.The launch of Flipkart Minutes comes at a time when other players in the quick commerce space are aggressively expanding their operations.The ET had earlier reported that Flipkart was planning to operate around 100 dark stores to bolster its quick-commerce offerings during the upcoming festive season. Dark stores, which are mini warehouses strategically located for rapid deliveries, have become a crucial component of quick commerce operations.Blinkit, for instance, recently announced ambitious plans to increase its dark store count to 2,000 by 2026. This doubles down on its earlier announced plans to have 1,000 dark stores by March 2025. Similarly, Zepto aims to double its network to 700 dark stores by March 2025. Swiggy Instamart , another major player, currently operates more than 500 such warehouses.Interestingly, Amazon, a key player in the e-commerce space, has not shown interest in the quick-commerce business in India so far. However, it does operate a grocery store service dubbed "" Amazon Fresh ,"" offering same-day delivery for groceries. This is similar to what Flipkart has also been offering through its Grocery tab.","Flipkart has launched its quick commerce service'Flipkart Minutes'in select areas of Bengaluru.

California man credits Apple Watch for saving his life: ‘I wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for this little device’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/california-man-credits-apple-watch-for-saving-his-life-i-wouldnt-be-here-if-it-wasnt-for-this-little-device/articleshow/112306053.cms,"Apple Watch detects user’s low heart rate



What doctor said

An Apple Watch user is crediting the smartwatch for saving his life after the wearable alerted him about a life-threatening condition. Peter Moore , a resident of Montecito, California shared his experience with a local news publisher KTLA. Narrating the incident, he said “I wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for this little device”.Moore, who is a former tech executive, said that he was on his way to the airport when he began to feel “a little lightheaded and a little faint”.“Like a typical male, I thought, ‘I’ll go to Starbucks. That’ll fix it,'” Moore explained before he received a notification from the Apple Watch he was wearing.“My phone started to ping and said ‘low heart rate,’ which I’d never seen before. And so I looked at it… my heart rate had dropped to 32. And it was insistent in its notifications that something wasn’t right,” said Moore. He then contacted his wife who took him to hospital.“The doctor kind of theatrically ran in and said, ‘This is not good. This is not good. You need a pacemaker right now,'” Moore said.Omid Yousefian, the cardiac electrophysiologist at Sansum Clinic Cardiology who treated Moore said “Yes, his watch had a big role in saving his life”.“These days, 25% of the population over the age of 40 … have a high chance of experiencing atrial fibrillation,” Yousefian explained.“For us physicians, symptoms are the most important thing. [Moore] was notified by his watch that his heart rate is slow and he correlated that with the symptoms that he had. So he didn’t wait. He didn’t sit. He came to the hospital directly. So he made a very smart move,” Yousefian told the publication.","Peter Moore, a former tech executive, was on his way to the airport when he began to feel “a little lightheaded and a little faint” He received a notification from the Apple Watch he was wearing that his heart rate had dropped to 32.

The lawyer detailed his ordeal on social media, highlighting the fraudulent tactics employed by the delivery executive.Unny took X (formerly known as Twitter) to post about the new kind of smartphone exchange scam.The incident occurred on July 21, 2024, when Unny placed an order for the iPhone 15 on Amazon. The following day, a delivery executive arrived at his residence and handed over the new phone after receiving the necessary OTP. However, the executive then requested another OTP, claiming it was required to complete the exchange.Despite Unny's hesitation, he was convinced to return the new iPhone to the delivery executive after speaking to the latter's supervisor.Unny contacted Amazon customer care the following day to report the incident. Initially, Amazon assured him of a refund if the product was not delivered. However, subsequent inquiries revealed the case was under investigation with a resolution deadline of July 31.On July 31st, Amazon concluded its investigation and informed Unny that a refund was impossible. The company's explanation lacked substance, as they had not thoroughly verified the scam details. The fact that Unny still possessed his old iPhone directly contradicted Amazon's claim that the exchange was complete.While Amazon has eventually issued a refund to Unny, his ordeal underscores the considerable risks inherent in online transactions, even when dealing with reputable platforms like Amazon.Always verify the identity of a delivery executive before sharing your Amazon OTP. This crucial step can protect you from falling victim to scams.“This is the story of my worst experience with @amazonIN On 21.07.2024, I ordered iPhone 15 from Amazon in exchange for my iPhone 13. On 22.07.2024, the delivery executive came at around 930 PM. I gave the OTP and took the product, and gave my phone to the executive.He said I have give another OTP. I had already given the OTP and was wondering what other OTP is to be given for exchange. I said I dont have any other OTP than the one I have given. He stayed there for few minutes & then called his supervisor.After speaking with the supervisor, the delivery exec asked for return of the product since the ""exchange is not final"".I insisted that I speak with the supervisor. The supervisor tells me that the exchange is done by a different team & requests for the product to be returned. I said I cannot give away the product especially since the OTP is given and the app was showing that the product is delivered. But this supervisor Ashok (8076650306) requested me to return, lest his team will have to make for the loss.Upon his request and assurance that the product will be ""reattempted"" the next day, I gave the product to the delivery exec (Vishal 8826421956) after taking the supervisor's and the delivery exec's number. On 23.07.2024, I spoke with the Amazon Customer Care and raised a complaint to which I assured that refund will be initiated if the product is not delivered. Call centre asked me to follow up on 25.07.2024.On 26.07.2024,when I called them, the customer case asked me to wait till 31.05.2024 as ""it has to be investigated"". Today, when I call Amazon, they said ""investigation"" is complete and that refund cannot be initiated. No fact-finding was done by Amazon in this. Now, we are staring at a loss of Rs. 38000 and a possible scam done by supervisor, delivery exec and others at Amazon. If they say that the exchange is done, then they can very well see the old phone that I still use with me.This could happen to any one of you and please be aware while dealing with @amazonIN.”","Supreme Court lawyer Mukul P Unny was scammed out of Rs 38,000 while attempting to exchange his iPhone 13 for an iPhone 15 on Amazon.in.
