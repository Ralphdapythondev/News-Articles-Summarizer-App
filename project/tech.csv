How this iPhone update may be affecting Spotify users,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-this-iphone-update-may-be-affecting-some-spotify-users/articleshow/110600529.cms,"How iOS 17 versions are affecting Spotify experience for iPhone users



What Spotify has to say about the issue



Apple is expected to introduce its next iPhone operating system, iOS 18 , at its upcoming annual developer conference, WWDC 2024 which is set to begin on June 10. However, some versions of the existing iOS 17 are reportedly affecting some Spotify users . The report didn’t specify when exactly this change rolled out. However, based on numerous user reports, this change was likely included with iOS 17.4, the report adds.Some iPhone users have complained that iPhones running on different versions of iOS 17 are stopping users who are casting media to other devices to control the volume using their phone’s physical buttons . According to a report by Android Authority, several users have taken to social media platforms like Reddit and the Spotify Community forums to report about the issue.The report noted that iPhone users can still control the volume of connected devices using the device menu’s software volume slider. However, that’s inconvenient for many users, as now they have to bring up the dedicated menu more frequently. Before this change, users were able to change the volume more easily and quickly by clicking the iPhone’s side buttons.The report also reveals that this issue isn’t affecting the Apple Music or TV Remote apps and they still support controlling the volume of media playing on tvOS using the iPhone’s physical buttons.Meanwhile, this functionality didn’t seem to work while using the Spotify, YouTube, and YouTube Music apps on iPhone and Apple TV. This indicates that all third-party apps have likely been affected.As per a Spotify Community moderator, a recent iOS change has stopped the music streaming app from using the iPhone’s volume buttons to controlSpotify Connect devices .Addressing a compliant in the Spotify Community, the moderator stated: “Due to updates on iOS, Spotify users no longer can use their iPhone’s volume controls to change the volume on connected speakers. Instead, please use the volume slider in the device menu.”Moreover, Spotify has also removed the feature from its app. So, even if users are running an older iOS version, they will lose the feature once they update the Spotify app.","Apple is expected to introduce its next iPhone operating system, iOS 18, at its upcoming annual developer conference, WWDC 2024 which is set to begin on June 10.

AMD has teamed up with Intigriti, a crowdsourced security service provider, to launch a new bug bounty program. This initiative invites security researchers, ethical hackers, and other experts from the general public to submit bugs found in AMD’s hardware, firmware, or software through the Intigriti platform and receive monetary rewards for their efforts.In a blogpost, Intigriti noted that the rewards offered by AMD on its platform will vary based on the severity of the bug and its product category.Here’s what you can earn if your bug bounty submission is accepted by AMD:You can also report bugs directly to AMD's Product Security Team. However, this route does not guarantee a monetary reward, although researchers will receive credit in the published security bulletin.Earlier, AMD had a private bug bounty program that only a select few could join. By expanding this program to the public, AMD aims to attract researchers from diverse backgrounds, encouraging them to identify issues in AMD’s products. This broadens the range of testers and includes experts from fields previously not considered in AMD’s private testing.Other major tech companies also offer bug bounty programs that help them ensure that their systems and products are kept safe from undiscovered vulnerabilities. Intel has its Project Circuit Breaker bug bounty program, and invites community members to work with Intel staff to discover flaws in its products.According to a report by Tom’s Hardware, hackers could earn well over $90,000 annually from finding bugs. In 2023, Google paid out at least $10 million in bug bounties, while Polygon Technology paid $2 million to an individual researcher after they discovered a critical flaw.","AMD has teamed up with Intigriti, a crowdsourced security service provider, to launch a new bug bounty program.

US arrests Chinese man for running the world's largest zombie network with these 6 malicious VPN apps,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/us-arrests-chinese-man-for-running-the-worlds-largest-zombie-network-with-these-6-malicious-vpn-apps/articleshow/110599335.cms,"How hackers installed ransomware in devices

Tips to protect yourself

Avoid free software, especially VPNs bundled with pirated content. These can contain hidden malware.

Steer clear of suspicious websites and ads. Clicking on them can unknowingly download malware.

Don't open attachments or click links in emails from unknown senders, especially if they seem urgent or request personal information.

Regularly update antivirus and operating systems to ensure they can identify the latest threats.

The US Justice Department, in collaboration with international agencies, has arrested a Chinese national who has been pushing malware onto victims' devices using multiple malicious VPN applications . This is said to be the “the largest ever operation against botnets, which play a major role in the deployment of ransomware "".YunHe Wang , along with his conspirators, had been running the 911 S5 – one of the largest residential proxy services and botnet with over 19 million compromised IP addresses in over 190 countries and confirmed victim losses in the billions of dollars.“Working with our international partners, the FBI conducted a joint, sequenced cyber operation to dismantle the 911 S5 Botnet—likely the world's largest botnet ever. We arrested its administrator, Yunhe Wang, seized infrastructure and assets, and levied sanctions against Wang and his co-conspirators,” said FBI Director Christopher Wray.The ‘free’ VPN applications that hackers used to attack users globally include MaskVPN, DewVPN, PaladinVPN, ProxyGate, ShieldVPN, and ShineVPN.The 911 S5 botnet infected devices through hidden malware disguised as ""proxy backdoors"" embedded within free, fake VPN applications. These VPNs were often bundled with pirated software and video games, tricking victims into downloading them.Once the VPN app is downloaded, it would install silently, turning the victim's device into part of the botnet without their knowledge.“The proxy backdoor enabled 911 S5 users to re-route their devices through victims' devices, allowing criminals to carry out crimes such as bomb threats, financial fraud, identity theft, child exploitation, and initial access brokering,” the FBI said.The FBI and partner agencies recommend that people should take precautions to protect themselves against botnets:","The 911 S5 botnet infected devices through hidden malware disguised as ""proxy backdoors"" embedded within free, fake VPN applications.

The country sees China's efforts as a threat to its chip expertise .“The facilitators of relevant mainland China companies in Taiwan should not be under any illusions and challenge the determination to enforce the law resolutely crack down on illegal business operations and the poaching of talent,” the bureau said in a statement.In 2022, Taiwanese prosecutors accused Luxshare of stealing commercial secrets from a Taiwanese competitor, Catcher Technology .

Google has unveiled a significant battery life improvement in the upcoming Android 15 update . By optimizing the Doze mode feature, standby times are set to see a jump of up to three hours on compatible devices.Doze mode automatically puts unused apps and processes to sleep when the phone remains idle. This update focuses on speeding up the activation of Doze mode.According to Google's internal testing, this translates to Android 15 devices entering Doze mode 50% faster compared to Android 14.The faster Doze mode activation has a direct impact on battery life. Google claims users can expect up to three additional hours of standby time on certain devices. This translates to a significant boost, especially for users who don't use their phones constantly but still experience battery drain throughout the day.The improved Doze mode is expected to be a general feature across all devices receiving the Android 15 update. While the exact improvement in standby time might vary depending on individual phone models and usage patterns, it signifies a positive step towards better battery management for the entire Android ecosystem.The focus on battery optimization extends beyond smartphones.

Apple may bring iPhone 16 series in two new colours: Details,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/mobiles-tabs/apple-may-bring-iphone-16-series-in-two-new-colours-details/articleshow/110260524.cms,"

Pro models may get a new Rose colour

Apple

may rename existing colours

Apple iPhone 16 series launch is months away. But the rumour mill is buzzing with expected features, design and now colour of the 2024 iPhone lineup. Popular Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo says that the Cupertino-based company may add two new colours to the iPhone 16, replacing the existing ones.The information was shared by Kuo in a post on X, formerly Twitter .In the post, Kuo says that the Pro models - iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max could be offered in black, white or silver, gray or ""Natural Titanium,"" and an all-new rose. The existing iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max are offered in Black Titanium, White Titanium, Blue Titanium and Natural Titanium colours.Kuo reveals that the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus are expected to come in black, green, pink, blue and white colour variants. Apple may also rename previous colours as well, Kuo adds. For example, the existing white could be renamed to starlight. “Also, even if the colour name is the same as the existing model, it may look different”, he says.Earlier, Kuo said that the iPhone 16 Pro Max is expected to feature a new battery with better energy density, potentially enhancing battery life if Apple maintains the same battery size. According to Kuo, iPhone 16 Pro Max will reportedly see a substantial redesign of its battery, switching from an aluminium to a stainless steel casing. This shift not only increases the battery's energy density but also improves its structural integrity. While stainless steel is less effective at dissipating heat compared to aluminium, it offers stronger protection, which could be beneficial for the overall durability of the device.In a related news, display analyst Ross Young said that the display production for Apple iPhone 16 will begin next month. This is on schedule with the timing of last year’s iPhone 15 production and the 2024 iPhone series launch may follow the same timeline as last year.","Apple may add two new colours to the iPhone 16, replacing the existing ones.

As India undergoes its largest democratic exercise, the Lok Sabha Elections 2024 , WhatsApp’s Tipline has emerged as a crucial tool for combating the spread of deepfakes and misinformation. Created by the Misinformation Combat Alliance’s (MCA) Deepfakes Analysis Unit (DAU), the Tipline aims to raise public awareness and provide assistance in identifying AI-manipulated content.: Launched in March 2024, WhatsApp’s Tipline has quickly become a trusted resource for users seeking to verify the authenticity of images and videos. Since its inception, the Tipline has received hundreds of messages from users asking for help in distinguishing real from fake content.: The Tipline is accessible in multiple languages, including Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, and English, making it widely usable across India’s diverse linguistic landscape.Users can flag suspected deepfake content by sending audio notes or videos to the Tipline. The process is listed below:Most of the manipulated content received involves doctored videos where the original audio is altered using AI to make a person appear to say something they did not. These videos often feature prominent figures such as actors, businessmen, politicians, and TV anchors. Additionally, AI-created memes of politicians using face-blending techniques or other less sophisticated methods have been commonly reported.WhatsApp’s Tipline uses advanced generative AI to analyze and detect deepfakes. This involves reconstructing the mouth movements of subjects to sync with altered audio, making the deepfakes appear more convincing.Pamposh Raina, Head of the DAU, emphasized the collaborative nature of the DAU’s approach. By partnering with detection and forensic experts, the DAU supports its fact-checking partners who play a critical role in this project. Raina stated, “The strength of the DAU lies in the collaborative model which it is building by partnering with detection and forensic experts. Our goal is to drive public awareness on the issue of algorithm-based fabrication, and I am confident that this symbiotic model can be replicated globally to combat misinformation spread through audio and video content produced using generative AI.”The successful implementation of WhatsApp’s Tipline during the Lok Sabha elections 2024 highlights the potential of such tools in combating misinformation. As deepfake technology continues to evolve, the need for robust detection and public awareness mechanisms becomes increasingly critical. WhatsApp’s initiative sets a precedent for similar efforts worldwide, showcasing how technology and collaboration can effectively address the challenges posed by AI-generated misinformation.",WhatsApp’s Tipline uses advanced generative AI to analyze and detect deepfakes.

All equipment and manpower are stretched, it's a tough time for the Delhi Fire Department. 12 people including children have so far died in May in Delhi... We are mainly receiving calls from industrial areas related to industry and godowns, and in these areas, it takes more time... If the temperature rises by just 1 degree more, I think the calls will cross 250 per day. We have adopted new technologies. Many of the equipment like drones... are there that the fire department has bought for the first time,"" Delhi Fire Department Director Atul Garg told ANI.",A fire broke out inside a flat in a posh high-rise society in Noida earlier this week.
