Why Microsoft Teams users globally must be careful when contacted by their company’s ‘IT staff’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-microsoft-teams-users-globally-must-be-careful-when-contacted-by-their-companys-it-staff/articleshow/114659676.cms,"How Black Basta hacking group works

Hackers are exploiting Microsoft Teams to launch sophisticated ransomware attacks against corporations globally. In a new wave of cyberattacks , criminals are impersonating corporate help desk staff to trick employees into installing malicious software , ultimately deploying the BlackBasta ransomware.According to a report by US-based cybersecurity company ReliaQuest (via Bleeping Computer), Black Basta is a ransomware operation that has been active since April 2022. The group is said to be one of the branches of the disbanded Conti cybercrime syndicate that was shut down in June 2022.Black Basta members breach corporate networks through various methods, including vulnerabilities, partnering wish malware botnets and social engineering .Previously, BlackBasta group used to flood employees' inboxes with non-malicious emails and then pose as IT help desk staff over the phone to offer assistance over ‘ongoing’ cyber attack’. The employee contacted would then be tricked into installing remote access tools like AnyDesk or enabling Windows Quick Assist, giving the attackers access to the network.Now, instead of phone calls, the attackers are utilising Microsoft Teams to contact employees. They impersonate IT help desk personnel through external user accounts with deceptive display names like “Help Desk.”""These external users set their profiles to a 'DisplayName' designed to make the targeted user think they were communicating with a help-desk account,"" the report says.""In almost all instances we've observed, the display name included the string 'Help Desk,' often surrounded by whitespace characters, which is likely to center the name within the chat. We also observed that, typically, targeted users were added to a 'OneOnOne' chat,"" it added.They also create a convincing illusion of legitimacy, leading employees to believe they are interacting with internal support staff. Once the contact is established, the attackers then trick employees into installing remote access tools or enabling Quick Assist, eventually having access to the company system.","Hackers are exploiting Microsoft Teams to launch sophisticated ransomware attacks against corporations globally.

Every aspect of AI, the natural resources are here. The digital economy is here... so there are lots and lots of data.

As a Bloomberg report said, ""The reception Huang received in India's commercial capital Mumbai was reminiscent of the ""Jensanity"" seen in other parts of the world, especially Taiwan, as his popularity climbs with Nvidia's soaring earnings and multi-trillion dollar market valuation.""Huang praised India's rapid digitalisation and its potential in the AI sector. ""Very few countries have this amazing natural resource called IT and computer science expertise,"" he said.The event, where the U.S. company unveiled plans to supply Reliance Industries and other Indian firms with its AI chips, had to be reportedly delayed for more than half an hour due to the crowd that one Nvidia employee said was ""easily a few thousand"".Nvidia CEO Huang and Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani announced a strategic partnership to build state-of-the-art AI infrastructure in India at the summit. The collaboration aims to accelerate India's transformation into a global AI powerhouse by leveraging the nation's vast talent pool and burgeoning digital infrastructure. ""We are among the only countries where the average age of 1.4 billion people is below 35,"" he noted. Ambani emphasised that India's aspirations, combined with the visionary leadership of the Indian Prime Minister, have set the stage for a digital revolution. ""We are at the doorstep of the new intelligence age,"" he said.","Jensen Huang, CEO of AI giant Nvidia, met Bollywood superstar Akshay Kumar at the 2024 Nvidia AI Summit in Mumbai.

German giant Siemens may make its biggest-ever acquisition with this US engineering software giant,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/german-giant-siemens-may-make-its-biggest-ever-acquisition-with-this-us-engineering-software-giant/articleshow/114558965.cms,"What's behind the 'big acquisition'

Industrial conglomerate Siemens AG is reportedly exploring a potential acquisition of Altair Engineering Inc, a leading provider of engineering software . According to a report in Bloomberg, quoting sources familiar with the matter, this move, if finalized, would mark one of Siemens' largest acquisitions to date.The report said that Siemens has been actively working with advisors to assess the feasibility of acquiring Altair, which is headquartered in Troy, Michigan. Altair's stock has seen a significant surge of 27% this year, valuing the company at approximately $9.1 billion. The company has been considering a sale, and Reuters recently reported that Altair was exploring such a move.While discussions are ongoing, there's no guarantee that Siemens will ultimately decide to proceed with the acquisition. Other potential bidders could also emerge for Altair. Representatives from both companies have declined to comment on the matter.Founded by James Scapa, Altair offers a wide range of engineering software solutions to companies across various industries, including aerospace, automotive, energy, and financial services. The growing demand for such tools, driven by the increasing adoption of artificial intelligence, makes Altair a particularly attractive target for Siemens.Under the leadership of CEO Roland Busch , Siemens has been strategically shifting its focus away from heavy equipment businesses and towards higher-margin, software-driven product lines. This strategic shift aligns with the company's aim to catch up to its competitors in the automation industry, such as Rockwell Automation and Schneider Electric.The potential acquisition of Altair would further strengthen Siemens' position in the software market and enhance its capabilities in providing comprehensive engineering solutions to its customers.","Siemens AG is reportedly exploring a potential acquisition of Altair Engineering Inc.

The latest update brings a modern scrollbar design to the main Contacts tab, replacing the previous, blocky version.The new scrollbar boasts a sleek pill-shaped design with dynamic theming, similar to that found in the Pixel Launcher's app drawer. This update brings the Contacts app more in line with Google's current Material You design language, creating a cleaner and more cohesive visual experience.Along with the scrollbar redesign, the update also removes the dedicated overflow menu from the search bar. Now, users can access the ""Select all"" option by long-pressing a single or multiple contacts.These subtle changes aim to improve the overall usability of the Contacts app. The thinner, modern scrollbar allows for better viewing of contact names without obstructing the list. Additionally, the removal of the overflow menu simplifies the search functionality, requiring fewer taps to access the ""Select all"" option.The new scrollbar and search bar tweaks are rolling out as a server-side update to Google Contacts for Android, meaning the update may not be immediately available to all users. It's recommended to check the Play Store for updates or force close the app from the App info section to potentially trigger the update.","Google is giving its Contacts app for Android a refresh, with a focus on streamlining the user experience.

In the case of Chrome, they'll display a message like ""Link copied"" or ""Image copied"" when you successfully copy a link or image from a website.

It eliminates the need to switch tabs or visually confirm successful copying, especially on large screens with complex webpages.Currently, toast notifications appear only when copying links and images. There's no confirmation for copying plain text.

Researchers call ChatGPT maker OpenAI’s transcription tool used in hospitals ‘problematic’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/researchers-call-chatgpt-maker-openais-transcription-tool-used-in-hospitals-problematic/articleshow/114652870.cms,"(AP Photo/Michael Dwyer, File)

What researchers have to say

Whisper can invent things that haven’t been said

ChatGPT maker OpenAI 's Whisper , an AI-powered transcription tool touted for its accuracy, has come under scrutiny for its tendency to fabricate information, a report has said, adding that experts have called it problematic because the tool is being used in a slew of industries worldwide to translate and transcribe interviews.According to a report by news agency AP, experts warn that these fabrications – a phenomenon known as “hallucinations” – which can include false medical information, violent rhetoric and racial commentary, pose serious risks, especially in sensitive domains like healthcare.Despite OpenAI's warnings against using Whisper in high-risk settings, the tool has been widely adopted across various industries, including healthcare, where it is being used to transcribe patient consultations.According to Alondra Nelson, who led the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy for the Biden administration until last year, such mistakes could have “really grave consequences,” particularly in hospital settings.“Nobody wants a misdiagnosis. There should be a higher bar,"" said Nelson, a professor at the Institute for Advanced Study in PrincetonResearchers have also found that Whisper can invent entire sentences or chunks of text, with studies showing a significant prevalence ofhallucinations in both short and long audio samples.A University of Michigan researcher conducting a study of public meetings found hallucinations in eight out of every 10 audio transcriptions he inspected. These inaccuracies raise concerns about the reliability of Whisper's transcriptions and the potential for misinterpretation or misrepresentation of information.Experts and former OpenAI employees are calling for greater transparency and accountability from the company.“This seems solvable if the company is willing to prioritise it. It's problematic if you put this out there and people are overconfident about what it can do and integrate it into all these other systems,” added said William Saunders, a San Francisco-based research engineer who quit OpenAI in February over concerns with the company's direction.OpenAI acknowledges the issue and states that it is continually working to reduce hallucinations.","ChatGPT maker OpenAI's Whisper has come under scrutiny for its tendency to fabricate information.

Apple Vision Pro users may have a new way to watch spatial photos and videos shot on iPhones,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-vision-pro-users-may-have-a-new-way-to-watch-spatial-photos-and-videos-shot-on-iphones/articleshow/114651983.cms,"Apple Vision Pro gets more iPhone-friendly



Apple Vision Pro users may soon be able to view spatial photos and videos directly in the Safari web browser . In a conversation with PetaPixel, Apple’s Product Manager Della Huff and Design Tema member Billy Sorrentino has revealed that the company will support spatial photos and videos within the Safari web browser. This addition will allow app and web developers to show spatial media to Vision Pro users and 2D media to others.This addition will offer another way for users of Apple’s first-ever mixed reality headset to experience the immersive content captured on iPhones. This feature will also allow for easier sharing and viewing of spatial media beyond the limitations of the Photos app and third-party apps. Currently, spatial photos and videos, which are shot on iPhone 15 Pro and all iPhone 16 models, are primarily viewable within the Photos app on the Vision Pro headset. While some third-party apps attempt to facilitate sharing, they often add complexity to the process.These reported steps will help Apple make spatial content more accessible by adding native support for it in the Safari web browser later this year. Currently, viewing spatial photos and videos on a Vision Pro requires accessing the files directly, limiting its usability to the ones which are sent directly to the device via iMessage, Airdrop. This upcoming update aims to improve the process and encourage wider adoption of this format.In the report, Sorrentino said: “And at the same time, you can create all sorts of photos into spatial photos [in Vision Pro] including old historical photos. You could do this to all your old product reviews, you could do it to World War II photos, video game screenshots I mean, what's so cool about this technology is it gives us the ability to take things into that next dimension.”This update will allow websites and social media platforms to integrate spatial photos and videos directly into their content, making this immersive format more accessible to everyone. Users without an Apple Vision Pro won't miss out, as they can still view standard photos and videos. This change lays the groundwork for the coming days where spatial media becomes more prevalent as Apple Vision products gain wider adoption.",Apple Vision Pro users may soon be able to view spatial photos and videos directly in the Safari web browser.

In re Alibaba Group Holding Ltd Securities Litigation

China's e-commerce giant Alibaba has agreed to pay $433.5 million to settle a US class-action lawsuit, reports Reuters. Filed by investors in 2020, the lawsuit alleges that the company engaged in monopolistic practices. It alleges that Alibaba had restricted merchants to a single distribution platform, a practice claimed to breach anti-monopoly and unfair competition laws.The company said that it has reached the settlement to avoid the expense and disruption of prolonged litigation. The settlement proposal, the e-commerce giant said, has been submitted in Manhattan federal court. It is pending approval from the US District Judge George Daniels.As per the report, the settlement covers investors in Alibaba's American depositary shares from November 13, 2019, to December 23, 2020. The settlement addresses claims that investors incurred losses when the market recognized Alibaba’s alleged misleading statements, leading to a decline in its stock price.In court filings, the plaintiffs’ lawyers described the proposed settlement as “an exceptional result,” noting that it significantly surpasses the median recovery in securities class actions where investor losses exceeded $10 billion. If the investors has proceeded with the case, Alibaba investors could have potentially pursued up to $11.63 billion in damages, according to the lawyers. The case is titled, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 20-09568.","Alibaba will pay $433.5 million to settle a US class-action lawsuit alleging monopolistic practices.

Amazon Web Services CEO Matt Garman said he does not know how many employees might leave the company when its mandatory five-day return-to-office policy takes effect in January, though he believes most staff support the change.Speaking at The Wall Street Journal's Tech Live event on Monday evening, Garman addressed concerns about potential employee departures , telling staff, ""If it's not for you, then that's okay — you can go and find another company if you want to.""The AWS chief has consistently maintained that approximately nine out of ten Amazon employees he's spoken with are ""actually quite excited by this change,"" according to both his recent public comments and an internal all-hands meeting transcript from last week.Garman defended the stricter in-office policy by emphasising its benefits for innovation and execution speed. ""Particularly as we really think about how do we want to disrupt and we want to invent on behalf of our customers, we find that there is no substitution for doing that in person,"" he said at the WSJ event.He highlighted the advantages of spontaneous workplace interactions, such as ""writing on a whiteboard or you're talking to people in the cubicle next to you or you're running into people that are in a different department, but you see them at the coffee line.""

Elon Musk's empire

Tesla CEO Elon Musk 's wealth skyrocketed by a staggering $26 billion on Thursday (October 25), propelled by a significant surge in Tesla's stock price. Tesla shares soared 22% as the company had its second-best day ever on the stock market, since 2013, following an earnings beat and an uplifting projection for 2025 growth.This latest windfall solidifies Musk's position as the world's richest person, with a net worth now estimated at around $269 billion. According to Forbes, this puts him more than $50 billion ahead of good friend and former Tesla board member Larry Ellison , who remains the largest shareholder in Oracle . Musk controls close to 13% of Tesla’s outstanding shares, accounting for the bulk of his net worth.The dramatic increase in Musk's wealth was triggered by Tesla's impressive quarterly earnings report, which surpassed analyst expectations. The company's strong performance, coupled with Musk's optimistic outlook for future growth, ignited a buying frenzy among investors. Tesla's stock soared 22% on the news, marking its second-largest one-day gain since its IPO.Prior to the earnings announcement, Tesla shares had been slumping and were headed for their worst month since January. But the stock erased its loss for the year and is now up 5% in 2024, compared to the Nasdaq’s 23% gain.Beyond Tesla, Musk's wealth is further bolstered by his substantial stakes in SpaceX , X (formerly Twitter), and xAI. His ambitious ventures into space exploration, social media, and artificial intelligence have significantly contributed to his overall net worth.While Musk's business endeavors have garnered significant attention, his recent political activism has also made headlines. His public support for Donald Trump and his involvement in political campaigns have raised concerns among some investors and analysts.The US Department of Justice has even issued a warning regarding Musk's voter sweepstakes, suggesting potential violations of federal election law. This legal scrutiny could have implications for Musk and his companies.","Tesla shares soared 22% as the company had its second-best day ever on the stock market, since 2013.

Welcome to Our Journey of Seva

Hello! We are Jainam and Jivika – siblings from Dubai, UAE, on a mission to make a difference. Even though we’re just kids, we believe that age is only a number when it comes to spreading kindness and positivity. Our recent journey began during our summer holidays when we left our home in Dubai for 50 unforgettable days in India. We had a purpose: to connect with children from various backgrounds, share our love for learning, teach skills for studying and setting goals, and inspire them to dream big.

Throughout our journey, we were met with inspiring moments and new friendships. We taught kids not only about studying but also about having the courage to set ambitious goals. Together, we laughed, learned, and grew, creating memories that we’ll treasure forever. This website is our way of sharing those memories with you – through photos, videos, and stories from our Seva journey. We hope it brings you closer to the incredible kids we met and encourages you to spread kindness in your own special way.

Along the way, people showed their appreciation through gifts, blessings, and even small donations, which we collected over our travels. When we returned to Dubai, we used a portion of this collection to support a young software developer from Delhi by purchasing this domain for his benefit. Through sharing our journey here, we aim to inspire others and keep the domain open for future sale to anyone who wants to continue this positive mission.

And one more thing – we love taking on new challenges! Make sure to watch our videos where we’ve shared some of these fun challenges, and we hope they inspire you to try something new too.

Thank you for being a part of our journey!

Best Regards,

Jainam & Jivika

Here's the previous letter that appeared on the domain webpage



Dear Executive of Reliance Industries,

I am an app developer based in Delhi, currently working on my startup. In early 2023, while scrolling through social media, I came across a news piece stating that Disney+ Hotstar was losing daily active users after losing the IPL streaming license, and Disney is considering selling or merging Hotstar with an Indian competitor.

This led me to hypothesize that, since Sony and Zee were pursuing their own merger, Viacom 18 (owned by Reliance) is the only major player with sufficient resources to acquire Disney+ Hotstar. This reminded me of when Jio acquired the music streaming service Saavn, they rebranded it to JioSaavn, and changed the domain from Saavn.com to JioSaavn.com.

I thought, ""If they acquire Hotstar, they might rename it to JioHotstar.com."" I checked for the domain, and it was available. I was excited, as I felt that if this happened, I could fund my goal of studying at Cambridge.

In 2021, I was working on a project that was selected for the Cambridge University Accelerate program. It was a transformational experience for me. I couldn't crack IIT and always wanted to learn from the best, coming from a Tier-ll college, being selected for this program was an incredibly valuable and practical experience. The startup program taught me many valuable lessons and provided insights into the ins and outs of startups for free, which was amazing. However, it was limited in scope - after all it was just a startup program.

Cambridge also offers a full degree program in entrepreneurship, which l've always dreamed of pursuing but could never afford, It's Cambridge, quite expensive. When I saw this domain become available, I felt things might just fall into place.

My intention of buying this domain was simple: if this merger happens, I might be able to fulfill my dream of studying at Cambridge

Now that the merger has actually happened, and news sources are confirming there will be only one site post-merger (either JioCinema or Hotstar.com), I believe JioHotstar.com would be a very fitting brand name for the merged entity. It maintains the brand equity of both brands and provides a rational transition for the current users of both sites.

To acquire this domain, kindly reach out to mail@jiohotstar.com from your company email address with an official letter attached, stating your authorization to purchase on behalf of Reliance Industries/Viacom18. For a multi-billion dollar company like Reliance, this will be a minor expense, but for me, the sale of this domain would be truly life-changing.

Best Regards,

A dreamer.

In an unexpected turn of events, visitors to the JioHotstar domain (https://jiohotstar.com/) are now being redirected to a webpage featuring the story of two siblings from the United Arab Emirates who run an educational initiative for disadvantaged children. The website now reads “Hello! We are Jainam and Jivika – siblings from Dubai, UAE, on a mission to make a difference. Even though we’re just kids, we believe that age is only a number when it comes to spreading kindness and positivity.

What the jury found

Apple has a ‘small’ win in its legal battle with medical device maker Masimo. A federal jury has ruled in favour of the iPhone maker in a patent infringement lawsuit against Masimo, awarding the tech giant a symbolic $250 in damages.According to a report by Bloomberg, the jury found that Masimo's original smartwatch designs and charger infringed on Apple Watch design patents, marking the latest development in a long-running legal battle between the two companies over smartwatch technology.The Apple attorney said that the company is not here for money but wants Masimo to stop copying its design.“We’re not here for the money. We want them to stop copying our design” and features,” Apple attorney said, lambasting Masimo for focusing on its innovations in pulse oximetry, the blood-oxygen measurement feature.An Apple spokesperson said that “teams at Apple worked for years to develop Apple Watch,” while “Masimo took shortcuts, launching a device that copies Apple Watch and infringes our intellectual property.”Masimo, on the other hand, celebrated the verdict as a victory, stating that the jury's focus on discontinued products undermines Apple's claims of irreparable harm.“Apple primarily sought an injunction against Masimo’s current products, and the jury’s verdict is a victory for Masimo on that issue,” Masimo’s statement said.The jury found that Masimo’s W1 smartwatch, Freedom smartwatch, and health module infringed on one patent, while Masimo’s charger infringed on another, as per the verdict form. The jury also found that Masimo’s infringement was willful.","A federal jury has ruled in favour of the iPhone maker in a patent infringement lawsuit against Masimo, awarding the tech giant a symbolic $250 in damages.
