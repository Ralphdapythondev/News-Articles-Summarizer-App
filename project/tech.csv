The complaints, filed between June 1 and June 12, seek reinstatement.Moneycontrol said that it accessed a copy of the filed complaint on the ministry's Samandhan portal and the same has been also verified by an official.The complaints claim that the Paytm management conducted unfair and unethical termination practices.

Melinda stepped from Gates foundation after the divorce

Bill Gates divorced Melinda French Gates in 2021. Years later, Melinda French Gates has opened up about her divorce with the Microsoft co-founder. In an interview with Time Magazine recently, she described the end of 27-years marriage as ‚Äòa painful and horrible experience‚Äô.‚ÄúGetting a divorce is a horrible thing. It‚Äôs just painful. It‚Äôs awful when you realize you need one,‚Äù she said.Although later she corrected 'horrible' to 'hard', but added that things are wonderful now that it‚Äôs over.In the interview, Melinda French Gates also talked about how getting divorced in a pandemic helped the couple get privacy. ‚ÄúIt gave us the privacy to do what needed to be done in private,"" she told the publication.She also reflected on being able to navigate the process while taking care of children. ‚ÄúYou know, I separated first before I made the full decision about a divorce.

During the interview, she told Time that she thought about the effect of divorce on the foundation.""I thought a lot about my three children. But I certainly thought about the effect on the foundation. Those are the three biggest buckets: me, the kids, and the foundation. And I wanted to make sure that when we came through it to the other side - all of those pieces were intact.‚ÄùMelinda also explained that she does not see her decision to exit the foundation as ‚Äòdownsizing‚Äô. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see it honestly as a downsizing ...I was just ready to be able to have full decision-making control about where all the funds go,‚Äù she said.","Melinda French Gates has opened up about her divorce with the Microsoft co- founder.

Save money on your OTT subscriptions with these best tips,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-tips/save-money-on-your-ott-subscriptions-with-these-best-tips/articleshow/111267043.cms,"Tips to slash your OTT subscription costs

Evaluate your subscriptions

How often do you use each service?

Are there overlapping content offerings?

Which services offer the most value for your viewing preferences?

Take advantage of free trials

Bundle subscriptions

Share subscriptions with family and friends

Look for discounts and promotions

Opt for ad-supported plans

Downgrade to a lower tier

Cancel unused subscriptions

Take advantage of yearly plans

Keep an eye on price increases

Rotate OTT subscriptions based on content releases

Use cashback and reward programs

Use public libraries

Monitor your viewing habits

In the age of streaming, Over-the-Top (OTT) platforms have completely transformed the way we consume entertainment. These platforms offer a vast array of content, from movies and TV shows to documentaries and live sports, making it possible to access virtually any type of entertainment on demand. The convenience and variety offered by OTT services have led to their widespread adoption, and many households now subscribe to multiple streaming platforms to cater to diverse viewing preferences.However, with the increasing number of available options, managing multiple subscriptions can become overwhelming and costly. Each platform typically requires a separate subscription fee, and these costs can quickly add up, putting a strain on your budget. Moreover, the abundance of content across various services means that it's easy to subscribe to more than you actually need or use, leading to unnecessary expenses.Fortunately, there are several strategies you can employ to save money on OTT subscriptions without sacrificing your viewing experience. By being strategic about your subscription choices and making the most of available offers and features, you can enjoy your favourite shows and movies while keeping costs under control.The first step towards saving on OTT subscriptions is to evaluate your current subscriptions. List all the streaming services you subscribe to and consider the following:By assessing your usage and preferences, you can identify subscriptions to cancel or downgrade. If you rarely watch content on a particular platform, consider cancelling it and redirecting those funds to a service you use more frequently.Many OTT platforms offer free trials for new users, ranging from a week to a month. Use these free trials to explore different services and their content libraries without committing financially. Set reminders to cancel the trial before it ends to avoid charges. You can also take turns using free trials from different platforms to enjoy their content without paying for multiple subscriptions simultaneously.Many streaming services provide bundled packages that combine multiple subscriptions at a reduced price. For instance, Disney+ offers a bundle that includes Hulu and ESPN+ for less than the cost of subscribing to each service separately. Search for bundles that match your viewing habits and preferences to save money.Many OTT platforms permit multiple profiles or simultaneous streaming on various devices. Utilise this feature by sharing subscriptions with family members or friends. Split the cost of a subscription among multiple users to reduce individual expenses. Check each platform's terms of service to ensure you are not violating any rules.Watch for discounts and promotions from OTT platforms, as many services provide special deals during holidays, anniversaries, or other significant events. Additionally, some platforms provide discounts for students, military personnel, and senior citizens. Sign up for newsletters or follow the platforms on social media to stay informed about upcoming promotions.Many streaming services provide ad-supported plans at a reduced cost compared to their ad-free versions. Although watching ads might be a slight inconvenience, it can lead to substantial savings. Evaluate whether ad-supported plans are a viable option for you, especially if the cost difference is substantial.If you don't need all the features offered by your current subscription tier, consider downgrading to a lower tier. If you're currently subscribed to a premium plan that includes 4K streaming but primarily watch content on a standard HD screen, transitioning to a standard plan could be a cost-saving option. Evaluate your viewing habits and requirements to decide if downgrading to a lower-tier plan would meet your needs effectively.Over time, it's common to collect multiple subscriptions, some of which may remain unused. Regularly assess your subscriptions and cancel those that are no longer in use. This straightforward action can redirect funds to more worthwhile purposes. Be vigilant about monitoring cancellation deadlines to prevent unnecessary charges for services you no longer require.Choosing a yearly plan instead of monthly subscriptions can lead to significant savings. Numerous OTT platforms offer discounts on annual subscriptions, equating to several months of service for free compared to monthly rates. Opting for a yearly plan is a prudent decision if you anticipate long-term use of a service, ensuring cost-effectiveness in the long run.Streaming services occasionally increase their subscription prices. Stay informed about upcoming price hikes and evaluate whether the service still offers good value at the new rate. If a price increase makes a subscription less affordable, consider switching to a different service or taking advantage of available promotions.The content offerings on OTT platforms are dynamic, regularly updating with new movies and shows while removing others. To optimise your savings, consider rotating your subscriptions according to the release schedules of your preferred content. Subscribe to a service for a period, enjoy the content you want, then cancel and switch to another platform. This method ensures you only pay for subscriptions when actively watching content that aligns with your current interests.Certain credit cards and cashback apps provide rewards for streaming service transactions, allowing you to earn cashback or points that can be used towards future subscriptions. Additionally, several OTT platforms have referral programs that offer incentives such as free months of service for referring new subscribers. These programs can help you maximise savings and get more value out of your streaming subscriptions.Several public libraries collaborate with streaming platforms like Kanopy and Hoopla to provide complimentary access to their services. Contact your local library to inquire about available OTT services, enabling you to enjoy a wide selection of movies and shows at no extra expense.Finally, paying attention to your viewing habits can assist you in making well-informed choices regarding your subscriptions. Monitor the time you spend on each platform and the types of content you enjoy the most. This data can help you select subscriptions that are not only cost-effective but also cater to your entertainment preferences effectively.","In the age of streaming, Over-the-Top (OTT) platforms have completely transformed the way we consume entertainment.

The AI features will be available later this year to users globally, including China ‚Äì one the most critical markets for the company. However, the company‚Äôs big AI push may face some challenges in China as regulators have in place strict rules around the technology amid tough competition.The three challenges that the company may face in China are (via CNBC):China‚Äôs AI market is tightly regulated and all companies launching AI models must have approval from the regulators for the commercial use of LLMs.The country has also made it mandatory for Generative AI providers to take down ‚Äúillegal‚Äù content.Since some of the features of Apple Intelligence are developed by the company itself, Apple will likely need to get its AI model approved by authorities under Chinese rules.China has also banned OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT. Some of Apple‚Äôs voice assistant Siri‚Äôs capabilities are dependent on ChatGPT. This could mean that Apple may have to find a local AI company that provides the same level of capabilities as ChatGPT.

Their new system, Private Cloud Compute, processes user data on Apple-owned servers, with the company claiming the data itself is not stored.However, in China, Apple's iCloud data is stored on servers located locally and operated by a third party. This may raise concerns about whether Apple can maintain complete control over its AI computing servers in the country.This means that Apple must have a similar partnership for its AI servers in the region to keep user data private.","Apple has announced Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI features that will run on iPhones, iPads and Mac PCs.

TCS sees headcount fall first time in 19 years

India's largest IT services company Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is facing a significant challenge filling a massive number of open positions. During a town hall earlier this month, the global operations head of TCS ' resource management group (RMG) Amar Shetye revealed that the company currently has thousands of open positions that it is not able to fill due to the skills gap.Shetye put the number at 80,000. For those unaware, the RMG team at TCS is responsible for allocation of available resources to various projects across the company and in case of any shortfall, fill such requirements through contractors. These contractors are on the roles of the hiring agencies and may or may not be hired as permanent staff by the company.Skills gap, here means, a mismatch between the skills possessed by employees and those their roles demand.An employee who attended the townhall anonymously told TOI, ""We were told that either skillsets or employee aspirations are not matching project requirements. However, at TCS, no associate is forced to take on a project if they are not comfortable with it.""""He told us that we should consider ourselves fortunate that the firm is not laying off employees for not being mapped to any project unlike other firms,"" another employee on the bench added.The company‚Äôs recent annual report revealed that 33% of job requirements are currently being met by grooming existing talent.Post the announcement of fourth quarter results, TCS CEO K Krithivasan said that the company has built one of the largest artificial-intelligence-ready workforces in the world. ""TCS is currently working over 200 engagements in GenAI with our clients and foresees a promising pipeline of future work across all industries,"" he wrote.TCS posted strong performance in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 2024-25. ""This is a quarter of strong deals and execution for us. Continuous focus on operational excellence helped us achieve a 26% operating margin."" The management also said that deal wins were ""across markets, industries and geographies.""The Mumbai-headquartered company said that it had signed new deals totalling $13.2 billion in the fourth quarter, which is one of the highest ever for the company even as it signalled a cautious turnaround for the industry. The company added that the pain may be bottoming out and FY25 will be better than FY24.TCS's Gen-AI deal pipeline is said to have touched $900 million. ‚ÄúOur Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) pipeline has surged to $900 million, marking a doubling in value. The Total Contract Value (TCV) of the deal comprises primarily standard-sized deals, with the exception of a significant win secured in Q3,"" the company said in its earnings report.TCS' full year headcount fell for the first time in 19 years.

This means that HDFC Bank customers will receive SMS alerts for UPI transactions exceeding Rs 100 when sending money and similar notification for when received is above Rs 500. However, the bank will continue to send email alerts for all transactions with no absolutely change.In a mail as well as SMS alert sent to its customers, HDFC Bank said: ‚ÄúStarting from 25th June, 2024: Email Alerts: Continue to receive email alerts for all UPI transactions.SMS Notifications: Now only for transactions above Rs 100 (money sent/paid) and Rs 500 (money received).‚ÄùThis change aligns with banking norms, which require text messages for transactions over Rs 5,000. Despite this, many banks send alerts for lower-value debits as well. HDFC Bank stated that feedback indicated alerts for low-value transactions were deemed 'not useful,' as there is often duplication of notifications from UPI payment apps.Bankers noted that bulk text messages cost between Rs 0.01-0.03 each. With UPI transactions averaging around 40 crores per day, banks collectively spend several crores daily on text message alerts.Banks are also promoting the use of UPI Lite for transactions up to Rs 500. UPI Lite allows a small amount of money to be set aside by the app, facilitating quick payments without the need for second-factor authentication.By reducing the frequency of low-value transaction alerts, HDFC Bank and others aim to streamline notifications for customers while also cutting costs.

Apple is expected to launch its next-gen iPhone 16 series models in September. However, rumours and speculations related to the upcoming iPhones are already making the rounds on the internet. Now, a new leak suggests that the iPhone 16 may get a major design overhaul.In a post shared on the social media platform X (earlier Twitter), a tipster named Ice Universe shared a video showing the alleged case of the upcoming iPhone 16.The leaked case reveals that the upcoming iPhone 16 may have a vertical rear camera setup, similar to the one that was last seen on iPhone 12.The new case design also reveals a new cutout at the right side of the phone which may house a dedicated camera shutter button for the iPhone 16 Pro models.The dedicated shutter button which is expected to come powered by the company‚Äôs haptic engine is rumoured to join the existing physical buttons. This button may use a soft tap for focus and a double tap/hard press for capture, offering an improved camera experience.This alignment will reportedly enable spatial video recording capabilities similar to iPhone 15 Pro which has two cameras stacked vertically while the third camera is arranged diagonally.However, the latest rumours contradict earlier reports that suggested that the iPhone 16 may arrive with a buttonless design.The leaked case also suggests that Apple may be adding more buttons alongside the volume and power controls.
