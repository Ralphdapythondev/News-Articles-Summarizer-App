"Bengaluru-based edtech startup, claimed to be third-largest student community, shuts down; founders to return 70% capital to investors",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/bengaluru-based-edtech-startup-claimed-to-be-third-largest-student-community-shuts-down-founders-to-return-70-capital-to-investors/articleshow/111936874.cms,"Time to ""build in India, for India and for the world""

Elevation Capital-backed upskilling and job finding platform Bluelearn has shut down operations and will return 70% of the capital it raised to its investors. Talking about the initial journey, founder Harish Uthayakumar said that he, along with co-founder Shreyans Sancheti, started BlueLearn in their third year of college as a Telegram group, which later became what he claims to be India's largest student community, with over 250,000 members.Elevation Capital was founded in 2021 by BITS Pilani alumni Uthayakumar and Shreyans Sancheti. The Bengaluru-based company started as a community on Telegram where students shared doubts with experts. The app is said to have provided a one-stop platform for students to learn new skills, network with peers, and apply for internships.""Our mission was to create an online university that leveled the playing field and allowed students studying in tier-2 and tier-3 colleges to access opportunities to learn, network, earn, and get exposure similar to students at BITS or IIT,"" Uthayakumar wrote in a post on LinkedIn.""However, we realized that building a venture-scale business with BlueLearn was tough. We had been very conservative with capital, allowing us to return 70% of the capital we raised back to investors,"" he added.""I'd encourage more people to start up and build in India, for India and for the world. We need more people to take risks and try out ideas that seem absurd. It's okay if you fail. I'm excited to share that a few of my teammates at BlueLearn have gone on to found their own startups,"" Uthayakumar concluded.The edtech company had raised $4 million in funding from venture capital firms like 100x VC, Titan Capital, Elevation Capital, and Lightspeed along with angel investors like Meesho founders Vidit Aatrey and Sanjeev Barnwal, Pixxel founder Awais Ahmed, among others.According to Uthayakumar, the community on its own app had expanded to 250,000 members from over 20 countries including the United States, the United Kingdom and Singapore.“Bluelearn was an impactful chapter, but it is time to move on to our next one,” Uthayakumar added.With this, Bluelearn joins the growing list of startups that have shut down operations.","Elevation Capital-backed upskilling and job finding platform Bluelearn has shut down operations.

Not sure how CrowdStrike bug affected millions of Windows machines: Microsoft VP has this 'car example' for you,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/not-sure-how-crowdstrike-bug-affected-millions-of-windows-machines-microsoft-vp-has-this-car-example-for-you/articleshow/111936814.cms,"It's 'fuel problem'

A faulty software update from US0based cybersecurity company CrowdStrike sent shockwaves through the global IT infrastructure, crippling systems reliant on Microsoft Windows. The outage, affecting 8.5 million devices worldwide, though less than 1% of the total Windows user base, had far-reaching consequences for businesses, governments, and individuals alike.Flights were grounded, hospitals delayed critical procedures, and financial markets experienced unprecedented slowdowns as the world grappled with the fallout.The incident is being labeled as one of the most severe IT failures in history.To illustrate how a third-party software update could cause such widespread disruption, Ann Johnson, a deputy chief information security officer at Microsoft, drew a comparison to a car's engine. “If you have an automobile, and you take that automobile to the fuel station and you get fuel that is not quality fuel or corrupted fuel, your automobile is not going to work properly,” Johnson said in an interview to Bloomberg. “The fuel is traversing throughout the entire system of your engine, and it will impact performance. It may impact the vehicle on a whole,” she added.In a similar way, Johnson said, ""CrowdStrike operates at a deep level within Windows, akin to the fuel system in a car,"" she explained. ""A problem with their software can have a cascading impact, just like bad fuel can ruin an engine.""","Faulty software update from CrowdStrike sent shockwaves through the global IT infrastructure.

Karnataka reservation bill: PhonePe CEO and founder Sameer Nigam issues this 'personal statement',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/karnataka-reservation-bill-phonepe-ceo-and-founder-sameer-nigam-issues-this-personal-statement/articleshow/111908948.cms,"Read PhonePe CEO Sameer Nigam’s personal note

“PhonePe was born in Bengaluru and we are incredibly proud of our roots in this city, which is well known for its world-class technology talent and vibrant diversity. From Bengaluru, over the past decade we have expanded across the length and breadth of India and been able to deliver secure and efficient digital payments for over 55 Crore Indians.

Bengaluru's reputation as the ""Silicon valley of India"" is truly well-deserved. The city thrives on an incredible culture of innovation, and attracts the most brilliant young minds from Karnataka and the rest of India. As a company, we are deeply grateful for the supportive business environment that Karnataka’s governments and its local

Kannadiga

populace have offered us. Without such an inclusive ecosystem and progressive policies, Bengaluru would not have become a global technology superpower.

As a company we also thrive on celebrating diversity, we have always tried hard to deliver fair, unbiased and meritocracy-based employment opportunities for all Indians - including to all local Kannadigas. We believe such an approach gives every Indian a good job a chance to shine, and ultimately helps create more societal and economic value for Bengaluru, Karnataka and India.

I read some recent media articles, relating to a few personal comments that I made last week regarding the draft job reservation bill. I would first and foremost like to clarify that it was NEVER my intention to insult Karnataka and it’s people. If my comments hurt anyone’s sentiments in such a way, I am truly sorry and would like to offer you an unconditional apology. I have the highest regard for Kannada, and all other Indian languages. In fact, I truly believe that linguistic diversity and rich cultural heritage is a national asset that all Indians should be proud of; and all Indians should be respectful of and celebrate local and cultural norms.

Bengaluru’s Indian startups are competing against trillion dollar giants like Google, Apple, Amazon and Microsoft. To do so, these companies must be able to employ the very best talent available in India purely based on their technology skills and proficiency in fields such as Coding, Design, Product Management, Data Sciences, Machine Learning, AI and beyond. As a nation, that is the only way we can build world-class companies that can compete in the global village that we live in today.

I also want to help create lakhs of jobs for Bengaluru and Karnataka. And, I believe with more dialogue and discussion, we can find ways to create more sustainable employment avenues. Let’s all work together to do this meaningfully and while creating long-term impact.”

PhonePe CEO Sameer Nigam issued a personal note following backlash over his comments on Karnataka 's job reservation bill. The controversy erupted after Nigam criticised the bill on social media platform X, questioning whether his children deserved jobs in their home city given his company's pan-India job creation.""If my comments hurt anyone's sentiments, I am truly sorry and would like to offer you an unconditional apology,"" Nigam said in a statement.He emphasised his 22-year connection to Bengaluru and respect for linguistic diversity.The Karnataka Cabinet had recently approved a bill mandating 50% reservation for locals in management roles and 70% in non-management positions within private companies. The bill, which also proposed 100% quota for locals in certain government jobs, was put on hold after industry backlash.Nigam stressed the need for merit-based hiring to build globally competitive companies.
