Understanding legal obligations

Addressing regulatory requirements

Mitigating risks of data breaches

Cultivating a culture of privacy

Enhancing customer trust

As data breaches and privacy violations are on the rise, safeguarding sensitive information has become imperative for all businesses in the Indian market. Whether it's the personal data of customers or proprietary information crucial for daily operations, the stakes are undoubtedly high. Amidst these challenges, compliance training is a critical tool for reinforcing organizational defenses and fostering a culture of data protection. By educating employees on Indian regulations such as the Information Technology (Reasonable Security Practices and Procedures and Sensitive Personal Data or Information) Rules 2011 and the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, organizations can mitigate the risks of inadvertent breaches and privacy violations. Moreover, compliance training serves as a proactive measure to demonstrate a commitment to ethical business practices, instilling trust among Indian customers and stakeholders. In an era where data protection is both a valuable asset and a probable liability, investing in comprehensive compliance training is necessary for safeguarding sensitive information and preserving the organization’s values and principles.Ensuring all employees know how to handle data safely plays a pivotal role within an organization. It empowers them with the knowledge and skills necessary to handle sensitive information responsibly, and helps avoid the risk of exposing sensitive information. Moreover, it demonstrates a company's commitment to doing business the right way, and instills trust among customers and stakeholders.In India, where data protection laws such as the Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act 2023 are evolving, compliance training becomes even more imperative. Educating employees on the nuances of these regulations, alongside global standards like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), equips them to handle data responsibly and mitigate risks effectively.Compliance training is like a guidebook that helps employees navigate through all the rules about keeping data safe. From the far-reaching GDPR in Europe to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) in the United States, a multitude of laws govern the handling, storage, and protection of data. Without a thorough understanding of these regulations, employees may inadvertently violate them, exposing the organization to significant legal repercussions and financial sanctions.Maintaining compliance with data security and privacy regulations resembles navigating a dynamic landscape. These regulations are constantly evolving, making it challenging for businesses to remain perpetually informed about the latest requirements. However, through comprehensive compliance training, employees can become proactive in understanding their obligations under these ever-shifting legal frameworks. The training equips them with the knowledge to handle data appropriately and respond effectively to security incidents. This proactive approach helps to mitigate the risk of incurring penalties for non-compliance.When it comes to data breaches, it can be disastrous for organizations—both financially and in terms of reputation. And does anyone know what's often behind these messes? Human error. So, through targeted training initiatives, employees can be taught how to keep data safe, identify potential security threats and respond effectively in the event of a breach, thereby reducing the likelihood of data incidents.Privacy starts with knowing how important personal data is and promising to protect it. Compliance training isn't just about knowing the rules—it's about taking responsibility and respecting people's privacy. Recognizing the importance of data privacy helps employees become champions of data protection, safeguarding the organization and its customers.As consumers become more cautious about their data, businesses need to demonstrate a serious commitment to privacy to earn and maintain trust.The importance of ensuring data security and privacy cannot be overstated. Compliance training serves as a powerful tool in this pursuit.This training fosters a culture of data protection, reassuring customers that their information is safe. This translates to stronger loyalty, a bolstered reputation, and a competitive advantage in today's privacy-conscious market. As regulations and cybersecurity threats continue to evolve, investing in comprehensive compliance training remains a necessity for keeping sensitive information safe and upholding the highest standards of security and privacy.","Compliance training is like a guidebook that helps employees navigate through all the rules about keeping data safe.

* Am I an optimist rather than a complainer?

* Do I keep my promises?

* Can I collaborate effectively?

Forget being the smartest or the fastest learner. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy believes a positive attitude is the key to thriving in your early career. Jassy, who took over as Amazon CEO in the year 2021, shared this advice during a recent interview with Microsoft-owned LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky .""A surprisingly large part of your success, especially in your 20s, comes down to attitude,"" said the 56-year-old CEO. But it's not just about being cheerful. A positive attitude translates to being a team player, meeting deadlines, and demonstrating a ""can-do"" spirit.Amazon CEO Jassy suggests asking yourself these questions to understand your mindset:These may seem simple, Jassy admits, but they're often underestimated. ""It's surprising how rare a great attitude can be,"" he remarked. ""And it makes a big difference.""A positive outlook can fuel your confidence to embrace challenges and opportunities like new assignments or training programs. After all, you'll be more likely to step outside your comfort zone with a ""can-do"" attitude.Jassy himself joined Amazon in 1997 as a marketing manager at just 29. After five years, he was offered a unique opportunity: becoming Jeff Bezos 's first ""shadow"" advisor. This role involved attending all the CEO's meetings.While some colleagues advised him against it, Jassy said that he focused on the positives. He saw it as a chance to develop his leadership skills. ""Even if it didn't work out for either of us, I could always move on,"" he said. ""But if it did, it would be an unparalleled experience."" And unparalleled it was.It's important to acknowledge criticisms of Amazon's leadership, particularly regarding warehouse worker treatment during the pandemic and an allegedly harsh work environment. Jassy himself has admitted room for improvement.""We're like a small country with so many employees,"" he said at the 2021 GeekWire Summit. ""There's always room to do better.""Regardless of your career stage, a positive attitude fosters stronger workplace relationships. ""People gravitate towards those with a positive outlook,"" Jassy concluded. ""They want to see those people succeed.""","Amazon CEO Andy Jassy believes a positive attitude is the key to thriving in your early career.

What Prime Minister Narendra Modi said

Prime Minister Narendra Modi commended Zomato CEO Deepinder Goyal for his entrepreneurial achievements in a recent post on X, formerly Twitter, emphasizing the value of diligence over lineage in modern India. The Prime Minister’s remarks were in reaction to a anecdotal story Goyal shared at the Vishesh Sampark event , hosted by Union Minister Hardeep Singh Puri.At the event, Goyal reflected on his journey from a modest background to founding Zomato, recalling his father’s initial doubts about his startup ambitions. Union Minister Puri shared a video of Goyal’s talk, underscoring the role of the government’s policies in aiding his success. “When I started Zomato in 2008, my father used to say ‘tu jaanta hai tera baap kaun hai’ as my dad thought I could never do a startup given our humble background. This government and their initiatives enabled a small town boy like me to build something like Zomato, which employs lakhs of people today!"" Goyal said at the event, as posted by Puri on X. “But it was this government and their initiatives that enabled a small town boy like me to build something like Zomato, which employs lakhs of people today!"" he said in his speech, as shared by Puri.Goyal’s narrative struck a chord on social media, particularly his recollection of his father’s skepticism when he launched Zomato in 2008. Despite coming from a small town in Punjab and facing familial doubts, Goyal credited the government’s support for enabling him to establish Zomato, now a major employer.Echoing Goyal’s sentiments, Prime Minister Modi tweeted, “In today’s India, one’s surname doesn’t matter. What matters is hard work. Your journey is truly inspiring, @deepigoyal! It motivates countless youngsters to pursue their entrepreneurial dreams. We are committed to providing the right environment for startups to flourish.”The Vishesh Sampark gathering served as a melting pot for startup community leaders, promoting cooperation and the exchange of ideas.Zomato, initially a restaurant review site, has grown into India’s leading food delivery service, operating in over 1,000 cities. Goyal, an alumnus of the esteemed IIT-Delhi, has been instrumental in its expansion.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi commended Zomato CEO Deepinder Goyal for his entrepreneurial achievements in a recent post on X, formerly Twitter.

Google announces Umoja: First Subsea Cable Connecting Africa and Australia; why it is important in its battle against Microsoft and Amazon,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-announces-umoja-first-subsea-cable-connecting-africa-and-australia-why-it-is-important-in-its-battle-against-microsoft-and-amazon/articleshow/110373300.cms,"Where all Umoja travels

What makes subsea cables important

Google is ramping up its global network infrastructure with a groundbreaking project: Umoja , the first-ever subsea fiber-optic cable directly linking Africa and Australia. This move comes amidst intense competition within the cloud computing industry, where Google is vying for market share with established players like Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure.The announcement follows recent widespread internet outages in Africa, which were linked to malfunctioning undersea cables. By building Umoja, Google aims to address this vulnerability and position itself as a provider of reliable connectivity solutions.Umoja's journey begins in Kenya, snaking its way through several African nations – Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe – before reaching its final land destination: South Africa. Notably, South Africa is home to Google's first African data center region, operational since early 2024.Interestingly, the land portion of Umoja is already complete, built in collaboration with Liquid Intelligent Technologies. Currently, Google is focused on laying the cable across the Indian Ocean to Perth, Australia, with an official completion date yet to be announced.""Umoja will significantly improve internet connectivity between African countries and the rest of the world,"" said Brian Quigley, Google Cloud's VP for global network infrastructure, in a recent blog post. He emphasized the importance of a geographically diverse network, especially for a region prone to internet disruptions.Subsea cables are the backbone of global internet connectivity, with hundreds crisscrossing oceans and seas. Tech giants like Google, Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft are increasingly investing in this critical infrastructure to enhance service quality for their customers. This translates to faster data transfers for cloud-based businesses and smoother streaming experiences.Umoja will not be Google's first foray into African subsea cable projects. They are already involved in the Equiano cable, connecting Portugal to Nigeria and South Africa. Earlier this year, Google also announced plans to build a cable linking South America (Chile) with Asia-Pacific (Australia) via French Polynesia.While Google hasn't pinpointed a specific completion date for Umoja, industry estimates suggest a timeframe of roughly three years, potentially bringing Umoja online by 2026.","Umoja will be the first subsea fiber-optic cable directly linking Africa and Australia.

The court ordered X to furnish data within two months, including content view counts, clicks, and reader engagement metrics like shares and likes.Significantly, the ruling mandates X to disclose revenue generated in France from this media content. Additionally, X must explain how its algorithms select content for publication.This information, while confidential, is deemed essential for ""a transparent evaluation"" of potential payments owed under neighboring rights law, according to the court. While this decision establishes X's obligation to comply with the law, a separate hearing will determine the actual compensation amount.AFP CEO Fabrice Fries lauded the ruling as a ""decisive step"" in enforcing neighboring rights. He emphasized that X must now provide the information required to calculate fair compensation for media outlets.This lawsuit follows failed negotiation attempts between the media organizations and X in 2023. AFP's lawyer called the ruling ""unprecedented"" and a necessary step to end X's ""obstruction."" X's lawyers, on the other hand, previously argued that user-posted content exempts the platform from neighboring rights.France has been at the forefront of implementing EU neighboring rights regulations.

The AI PC era is here with Microsoft Copilot+ PCs with Windows 11. Alongside the new ARM-based PCs, Microsoft has announced a host of new AI-powered features that require at least 40 TOPs of AI performance to run.Here we’ve explained all the new AI-powered features that Microsoft has announced as a part of the entire Copilot+ PC with Windows 11.Windows 10 debuted with a feature called Timeline.The feature was aimed at keeping a record of everything that users have done on their PC in last couple of days. From accessing a file to websites, apps, software and whatnot. However, Microsoft nuked the feature only to bring it back as “Recall” with the power of AI that does everything Timeline used to do, but better and more efficiently.Recall is a powerful feature designed to help you find and revisit anything users have seen or done on their PC. It acts like a photographic memory, capturing and organising your digital activities so you can easily locate information without remembering exact file locations or details.Recall continuously records your screen, capturing snapshots of your activities across all applications, websites, documents, and more. It builds a personal semantic index based on your interactions, which is stored locally on your device to ensure privacy. You can interact with Recall using natural language, and it will search through your recorded data to find what you need.Cocreator allows users to combine ink strokes with text prompts to generate images in real-time. Leveraging Neural Processing Units (NPUs) and local language models, it iterates on the artwork, providing high-quality outputs with powerful diffusion-based algorithms. Users can adjust the creativity slider to range from literal to expressive styles and continue refining their artwork effortlessly.This new AI feature makes photo editing easier and simpler for users by allowing them to apply preset styles such as Cyberpunk or Claymation to their photos. Users can transform backgrounds, foregrounds, or entire images and get visual inspiration for their creative projects. On Copilot+ PCs, users can generate, fine-tune, and save endless images quickly.Microsoft has announced DaVinci Resolve Studio now features NPU-accelerated Magic Mask for applying visual effects, while CapCut uses Auto Cutout for instant video background removal. These enhancements streamline video editing and content creation processes.Cephable introduces faster adaptive input controls using head movements or facial expressions, thanks to NPU-powered camera pipelines.

Apple may bring iPhone 16 series in two new colours: Details,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/mobiles-tabs/apple-may-bring-iphone-16-series-in-two-new-colours-details/articleshow/110260524.cms,"

Pro models may get a new Rose colour

Apple

may rename existing colours

Apple iPhone 16 series launch is months away. But the rumour mill is buzzing with expected features, design and now colour of the 2024 iPhone lineup. Popular Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo says that the Cupertino-based company may add two new colours to the iPhone 16, replacing the existing ones.The information was shared by Kuo in a post on X, formerly Twitter .In the post, Kuo says that the Pro models - iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max could be offered in black, white or silver, gray or ""Natural Titanium,"" and an all-new rose. The existing iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max are offered in Black Titanium, White Titanium, Blue Titanium and Natural Titanium colours.Kuo reveals that the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus are expected to come in black, green, pink, blue and white colour variants. Apple may also rename previous colours as well, Kuo adds. For example, the existing white could be renamed to starlight. “Also, even if the colour name is the same as the existing model, it may look different”, he says.Earlier, Kuo said that the iPhone 16 Pro Max is expected to feature a new battery with better energy density, potentially enhancing battery life if Apple maintains the same battery size. According to Kuo, iPhone 16 Pro Max will reportedly see a substantial redesign of its battery, switching from an aluminium to a stainless steel casing. This shift not only increases the battery's energy density but also improves its structural integrity. While stainless steel is less effective at dissipating heat compared to aluminium, it offers stronger protection, which could be beneficial for the overall durability of the device.In a related news, display analyst Ross Young said that the display production for Apple iPhone 16 will begin next month. This is on schedule with the timing of last year’s iPhone 15 production and the 2024 iPhone series launch may follow the same timeline as last year.","Apple may add two new colours to the iPhone 16, replacing the existing ones.

‘Godfather of AI’ Geoffrey Hinton: “Very worried about AI taking lots of…”,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/godfather-of-ai-geoffrey-hinton-very-worried-about-ai-taking-lots-of/articleshow/110254770.cms,"Hinton concerned of ‘extinction-level threats emerging’

Hinton is against the use of AI technology in the military



Geoffrey Hinton , the software engineer who is often regarded as the “godfather of artificial intelligence” has said that he is “very worried” about the artificial intelligence technology “taking lots of mundane jobs”. He said that it will be on to the governments to deal with the impact of artificial intelligence ( AI ) on income inequality.Hinton, who worked at Google until last year, said that while AI will increase productivity and wealth, the money would go to the rich “and not the people whose jobs get lost and that’s going to be very bad for society”.He noted that the government will have to establish a universal basic income , which means that the government will have to pay all individuals a set basic salary regardless of their means.“I was consulted by people in Downing Street and I advised them that universal basic income was a good idea,” Hinton, who left Google to talk more freely about the dangers of unregulated AI, told BBC.Hinton previously said that some of the dangers of AI chatbots were “quite scary”. He is of the view that AI chatbots can become more intelligent than humans and may be exploited by “bad actors”.AI could “evolve to get the motivation to make more of itself” and can autonomously “develop a sub-goal of getting control”, pointing out evidence of large language models choosing to be deceptive.""My guess is in between five and 20 years from now there’s a probability of half that we’ll have to confront the problem of AI trying to take over,” he said.As per Hinton, this will lead to an “extinction-level threat” for humans because they may have “created a form of intelligence that is just better than biological intelligence… That's very worrying for us”.“What I’m most concerned about is when these can autonomously make the decision to kill people,"" he added.","Geoffrey Hinton, the ‘godfather of artificial intelligence’ has said that he is ‘very worried’ about the artificial intelligence technology “taking lots of mundane jobs’ Hinton said that while AI will increase productivity and wealth, the money would go to the rich “and not the people whose jobs get lost”","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110254760,imgsize-126994,width-400,resizemode-4/110254760.jpg"

Phone condition: Assess the physical condition of the phone. Look for scratches, dents, or other signs of wear. Check the screen for cracks and ensure all buttons and ports function correctly.

Software updates: Ensure the phone is compatible with the latest software updates from the manufacturer. Older devices may not receive updates, which can impact security and functionality.

Network compatibility: Confirm that the mobile phone is unlocked or compatible with your network carrier. Some phones are locked to specific carriers, limiting your options.

IMEI check: Verify the phone's IMEI number to ensure it's not stolen or blacklisted. This step helps prevent buying a phone with legal issues or unpaid bills.

Performance testing: Test the phone's performance by running apps, browsing the internet, and checking the camera quality. Look for lagging or freezing issues.

Storage capacity: Determine the phone's storage capacity and assess whether it meets your needs for storing photos, videos, and apps.

Price comparison: Research the market value of the phone model you're interested in. Compare prices from different sellers to ensure you're getting a fair deal.

Seller reputation: Buy from reputable sellers with positive reviews or ratings. Avoid transactions with unknown individuals or suspicious online platforms.

The film, which has already been sold in 50 countries ahead of its September premiere, uses advanced artificial intelligence to replicate Putin's face on a real actor’s body.Vega, known for his popular Polish films, decided to use AI technology to create a more authentic portrayal of Putin.""To come extremely close to the dictator, we needed Putin, not an actor with make-up,"" Vega explained. The film’s trailer opens with a striking scene of the Russian leader cowering on the floor in diapers, setting the tone for its controversial narrative.As per an ET report, Vega humorously recounted his approach: ""I called Putin and asked him if he wanted to play in my movie... No, that was a joke."" Despite the jest, the director utilised AI to generate Putin's face due to the lack of sufficient high-resolution images for a full-body deepfake. The results, according to early viewers, are uncannily realistic.""Putin"" chronicles the life of the Russian president over six decades, starting from his childhood at age 10, where he is depicted being beaten by his stepfather. The film culminates in a fictional portrayal of his death, which Vega describes as ""a happy end.""The concept for the biopic emerged during the early days of Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Initially, Vega aimed to make a film about the Russian mafia but shifted focus to what he considered ""the biggest gangster.""Despite potential risks, Vega dismisses fears of reprisals, boldly stating, ""Putin should be afraid of me."" The director's venture into AI has broader implications for the film industry, particularly in Hollywood, where the technology is both a boon and a source of concern. AI advancements threaten traditional roles, especially among special effects technicians and extras, raising fears of job losses.These concerns were central to last year's strike by actors and writers, culminating in an agreement that included compensation for the use of AI-generated likenesses. Despite apprehensions, AI is already extensively used in the industry. For example, it was employed to de-age Harrison Ford in the latest ""Indiana Jones"" film, though studios often refrain from publicising these uses.Beyond film production, AI's applications are expanding in various sectors of the media. The Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media, for instance, uses algorithms to analyse screenplays for gender and diversity biases. YouTube, a significant player in film promotion and distribution, has leveraged AI for over a decade, employing it for automated subtitles and copyright protections.Since April, YouTube has begun labelling AI-generated content and enhancing its detection programs. Justine Ryst, head of YouTube France, emphasised that ""AI isn't going to take over creation. It's going to simplify the complex, and make possible the impossible."" She advocated for a balance between innovation and responsibility in utilising AI.","Polish director Patryk Vega unveiled his latest project, a biopic titled ""Putin,"" featuring an AI-generated deepfake of Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Watch: Sam Altman shares how he spent the 4-and-a-half days he was sacked as ChatGPT maker OpenAI CEO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/watch-sam-altman-shares-how-he-spent-the-four-and-a-half-days-he-was-sacked-as-chatgpt-maker-openai-ceo/articleshow/110203159.cms,"Sam Altman talks GPT-4o and Predicts the Future of AI

The big lesson learnt

Sam Altman , CEO of OpenAI , has been on a rollercoaster the last few years. Since the company's release of ChatGPT, he's widely regarded as the poster boy of Generative-AI world. He's met with world leaders, clashed with Elon Musk , and even joined the billionaire club. Amidst all this, he also got fired (briefly) from the company he co-founded.On a recent tech podcast ""The Logan Bartlett Show"", Altman said with a laugh that if he had more time to reflect, ""every day would have something crazy."" However, one truly surreal moment stands out: His four-day ousting from OpenAI.As reported by Business Insider, it wasn't the firing itself that was unreal. It was how he handled this bizarre situation. Altman described it as an ""insane, superjammed"" 4 ½ days where his body was in an ""adrenaline-charged state.""Within a day of being fired, world leaders started texting. He received messages from 10-20 presidents and prime ministers. He said it felt normal at the time, and he even thanked them without batting an eye.""It was just weird,"" Altman admitted. He barely slept or ate, but his focus and energy were off the charts.Once he got his job back, reality hit him. Stopping at a diner, he realized he hadn't eaten in days. Naturally, he celebrated with a feast: four ""heavy"" meals and two milkshakes (just for him!).The celebratory meal was great, but the real shocker came later. A president texted him, relieved things were settled.Suddenly, Altman realized how bizarre it all was. World leaders texting him during his firing shouldn't have felt normal, but it did. It showed him just how adaptable humans are.""We can get used to anything as the new normal, good or bad, pretty fast,"" Altman said. He sees this as a strength – humans can adapt to almost anything.""My takeaway is human adaptability to almost anything is just, like, much more remarkably strong than we realize,"" Altman said on the podcast. ""And you can get used to anything as the new normal, good or bad, pretty fast.""","Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, has been on a rollercoaster the last few years.
