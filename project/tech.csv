Bengaluru-based MNC exec loses Rs 51 lakh in ‘digital arrest’ scam that lasted 10 hours,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/bengaluru-based-mnc-exec-loses-rs-51-lakh-in-digital-arrest-scam-that-lasted-10-hours/articleshow/113720656.cms,"What exactly happened

A high-ranking executive at a multinational company (MNC) in Bengaluru was subjected to a 10-hour ""digital arrest"" scam, resulting in a financial loss of Rs 51 lakh. The victim, a product marketing head, was tricked into believing that they were under investigation by law enforcement agencies.The victim revealed that she received a call from the scammers around 9.50 am on September 17 claiming to be from FedEx.Following the caller's instructions to press 9, she spoke to a person who identified themselves as Ashwin Kumar from FedEx customer care. Kumar informed her that someone had used her Aadhaar details to send a parcel containing MDMA to Iran, which had been seized by the Mumbai police.The caller transferred the call, claiming it was to the Mumbai cybercrime department . A person named Pradeep, who identified themselves as a senior inspector, spoke to her about the drug consignment. The victim overheard someone else informing Pradeep that her Aadhaar card had been used for illegal activities in Jammu & Kashmir, West Bengal, and Karnataka.""I was then asked to come on a Skype call. A person introducing himself as DCP Milind Bharambe, Maharashtra, said illegal accounts have been opened across the country using my Aadhaar and Rs 9.7 crore have been moved through these accounts. He said the account was used for drug trafficking, money laundering, and funding sleeper cells to purchase AK-47 rifles,” the victim told TOI.The victim was instructed to maintain confidentiality and told that they were under digital house arrest. The call was then transferred to a person who identified themselves as George Mathew from the Reserve Bank of India. Mathew informed the victim that the RBI would investigate their account and that even a single rupee of black money could lead to seven years in prison.Mathew instructed the victim to open her bank mobile app and add eight beneficiaries. He then asked her to go to the pre-approved loan section and send him a screenshot. The scammers discovered that she was eligible for a ₹50 lakh pre-approved loan and instructed her to click on it, claiming the money would be used for the investigation. The victim followed their instructions, and her account was credited with the Rs 49,92,921 loan. The fraudsters quickly transferred this amount, along with other money in her account, totalling Rs 51.2 lakh, to the newly added beneficiaries.The ordeal lasted ten hours, during which the victim was denied food and water. When she later contacted the fraudsters to inquire about the promised refund, they did not respond. Realising she had been scammed, she immediately called the cyber helpline 1930.","The victim, a product marketing head, was tricked into believing that they were under investigation by law enforcement agencies.

Tesla’s stunning comeback

Key factors driving the surge in Elon Musk’s wealth

Tesla’s market performance: Tesla’s stock recovery has played the most crucial role in Musk’s resurgence. Investor optimism surrounding Tesla’s growth potential, advances in electric vehicles (EVs), and new product developments have driven the company's share price higher.

Improved economic conditions: The broader US economy has shown signs of improvement, and the Federal Reserve's decision to cut interest rates has helped alleviate fears of inflation and a potential recession. These moves have supported the stock market's recovery, benefitting Tesla and other tech-related companies.

Global EV demand: The global push toward clean energy and the growing demand for electric vehicles continue to bolster Tesla’s long-term prospects. While Chinese competitors have posed challenges, Tesla's reputation and continued innovation in the EV space keep it as a leader in the industry.

Musk's expanding portfolio beyond Tesla

SpaceX : Musk owns 42% of SpaceX, which was valued at $210 billion as of June 2023. SpaceX has continued to break new ground with ambitious projects like Starship and satellite internet service Starlink, reinforcing Musk's position in the space industry.

X (formerly Twitter): Musk acquired Twitter, now rebranded as X, for $44 billion in 2022. His vision for transforming the platform into an “everything app” encompassing social media, payments, and other services remains in development.

Neuralink: Musk's neurotechnology company, Neuralink, aims to develop brain-computer interfaces to help people with neurological conditions. Though still in its early stages, Neuralink is seen as a pioneer in the field of brain-machine technology.

The Boring Company: Musk’s infrastructure and tunnelling company focuses on transportation innovations, including building underground tunnels for high-speed transit systems in major cities.

xAI: Launched in July 2023, Musk’s artificial intelligence startup, xAI, aims to develop AI systems that benefit humanity. This new venture underscores Musk's commitment to staying at the forefront of cutting-edge technology.

Musk reclaiming the top spot

Elon Musk , the world's wealthiest person, has seen his fortune rise dramatically in 2023, with his net worth reaching $270 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Musk's wealth has surged by over $100 billion since April, marking an extraordinary rebound following a significant dip earlier in the year.At the beginning of the year, Musk’s net worth was $229 billion.However, by April, his fortune had plummeted to $164 billion due to a sharp 40% drop in Tesla’s stock price. Investors expressed concerns over Tesla’s performance, including disappointing delivery numbers in the first quarter of the year, and challenges from rising interest rates and increasing competition from Chinese automakers like BYD. These factors, combined with price cuts that impacted Tesla 's profit margins, caused a dip in Musk's wealth.The tide began to turn for Musk as Tesla shares rebounded by over 80% from their April low, restoring confidence in the company and its long-term outlook. Since early August alone, Musk's net worth has increased by $50 billion, a testament to the positive momentum surrounding Tesla and the broader stock market.In particular, Musk's fortune surged from $223 billion in early August to $270 billion in September, making him the fourth-largest wealth gainer of the year. Only Mark Zuckerberg (Meta), Jensen Huang (Nvidia), and Larry Ellison (Oracle) have seen more significant gains this year, with Musk leapfrogging other billionaires who had outpaced him earlier in the year.Several factors have contributed to this turnaround:While Tesla remains the primary driver of Musk’s wealth, his portfolio extends far beyond the electric vehicle giant. Musk holds significant stakes in several high-profile companies, including:Despite the fluctuations in his wealth throughout the year, Musk has retained his title as the richest person on the planet. He remains ahead of other billionaires like Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. However, it is worth noting that Musk's current wealth of $270 billion is still below his all-time high of $340 billion, which he reached in November 2021.Musk's rapid ascent in wealth since April signals a strong comeback after his status as the biggest wealth loser earlier in the year. His journey from a $100 billion decline to a $41 billion gain underscores the volatility of financial markets and Musk’s ability to adapt and thrive despite economic headwinds.As Musk continues to lead several groundbreaking companies, his influence extends across industries such as automotive, space exploration, social media, and artificial intelligence. While Tesla’s stock performance remains crucial to his net worth, his diverse portfolio ensures that his wealth is spread across various cutting-edge sectors.Looking forward, Musk’s wealth is expected to fluctuate with market conditions, Tesla’s continued innovations, and the progress of his other ventures. However, his ability to maintain his position at the top of the global wealth rankings reflects his resilience and strategic foresight.","Elon Musk is the world's wealthiest person, with a net worth of $270 billion.

What makes Appario Retail lawsuit important

Appario, the former biggest seller on Amazon India , has filed a legal challenge against the Competition Commission of India ( CCI ) over an antitrust investigation that found the e-commerce giant and several of its sellers in violation of local competition laws.According to a report in Reuters, the lawsuit, filed by Appario in the Karnataka High Court , seeks to quash the CCI's investigation report and a related order that required the company to submit its financial statements.Appario argues that the investigation was flawed and that the CCI exceeded its authority.Appario, which has since ceased to be a seller on Amazon, challenged the CCI in the High Court in Karnataka, saying the investigation report that names it must be ""set aside"", showed court records.The CCI's investigation, which began in 2020, followed a Reuters report that revealed Amazon's preferential treatment of certain sellers on its platform. The report alleged that Amazon had given Appario and a small group of other sellers special privileges, including discounted fees and access to proprietary tools. In 2022, the CCI raided Appario and some other sellers as part of its investigations.Amazon has consistently denied any wrongdoing, claiming that it treats all sellers fairly and complies with Indian laws. However, the CCI's findings and the subsequent legal challenge pose a significant challenge to the company's operations in India.The lawsuit marks the first legal challenge to the CCI's investigation and could have broader implications for the e-commerce industry in India. If Appario is successful, it could set a precedent that could embolden other companies to challenge the CCI's authority.","Appario, the former biggest seller on Amazon India, has filed a legal challenge against the Competition Commission of India.

What is the “Peaklight” malware



""This memory-only dropper decrypts and executes a PowerShell-based downloader. This PowerShell-based downloader is being tracked as PEAKLIGHT,”

How hackers can use Peaklight to infect Windows PCs

It connects to a content delivery network (CDN) that conceals harmful JavaScript code. This code executes directly in a computer's memory, leaving no trace on the system’s hard drive. Unleashing the malware downloader : The JavaScript then activates a PowerShell script named Peaklight.

The JavaScript then activates a PowerShell script named Peaklight. Downloading more threats: Peaklight acts as a downloader, retrieving additional malware from a remote server. This could include dangerous programs like Lumma Stealer, Hijack Loader, and CryptBot, which can steal user data or give attackers control of the user's computer.

""PEAKLIGHT is an obfuscated PowerShell-based downloader that is part of a multi-stage execution chain that checks for the presence of ZIP archives in hard-coded file paths. If the archives do not exist, the downloader will reach out to a CDN site download the remotely hosted archive file and save it to disk.”

A new type of malware called Peaklight is targeting people who download movies from illegal sites. This ""next-stage"" malware aims to infect Windows computers, ultimately deploying information stealers and loaders. Security researchers at Google's cybersecurity company Mandiant have warned that visiting illegal movie sites carries significant risks, including legal consequences and exposure to malware like Peaklight.In a blog post, Mandiant claims that Peaklight is a new and stealthy malware that operates entirely within a computer's memory, leaving no trace on the hard drive which makes it difficult to detect. Security researchers claimed that this malware is designed to discreetly download additional harmful software onto infected Windows systems.Mandiant noted.Mandiant explained that Peaklight uses a covert PowerShell script to deploy additional malware onto infected systems. This method facilitates the distribution of harmful programs such as Lumma Stealer , Hijack Loader, and CryptBot. These programs are offered as services for rent, enabling cyber attackers to steal information or take control of compromised computers.As per the report, cybercriminals are spreading the malware through fake movie downloads. For this, hackers are hiding dangerous Windows shortcut files (LNKs) within ZIP folders disguised as popular films.Once opened, the LNK file triggers the following chain reaction:The report noted that the malware was particularly stealthy because it operates entirely within the computer's memory (RAM). This makes it very difficult for traditional antivirus software to detect, as most antivirus programs primarily scan the user’s hard drive for threats.Mandiant researchers Aaron Lee and Praveeth D'Souza said:","A new type of malware called Peaklight is targeting people who download movies from illegal sites.

How this hotel is different from the conventional ones



""Most hotels are contained within four walls and a lot of times you are building the same unit over and over and over again. I've never been able to build with such little constraint and such fluidity ... just the curves, and the domes, and the parabolas. It's a crazy way to build.""

A crane-sized 3D printer is constructing the world's first 3D-printed hotel in Texas, US. According to a report by the news agency Reuters, El Cosmico , a hotel and campground near Marfa, Texas, is undergoing a unique expansion. Instead of traditional construction, a massive 3D printer is building 43 new hotel units and 18 residential homes across 40 acres.A video shared by Reuters on YouTube shows how the world’s first 3D-printed hotel is being constructed.In the video, El Cosmico owner Liz Lambert says that this is the world's first 3D-printed hotel. The partners behind the project - US-based 3D printing company ICON and architects Bjarke Ingels Group - can also be seen explaining the project.""This technology allows for unprecedented creativity,"" Lambert said highlighting the ability to easily incorporate unique features that would be expensive with conventional building methods.She said:The video shows the first two structures underway are a three-bedroom home and a single-room hotel unit, both featuring 12-foot high, curvy walls made from a ‘special’ cement-based material called Lavacrete .These walls are being ""printed"" by ICON's Vulcan, a massive 3D printer that stands 15.5 feet tall, weighs 4.75 tons and spans 46.5 feet wide. A print technician oversees the process as Vulcan's robotic arm and nozzle layers the Lavacrete.ICON CEO and founder Jason Ballard also explained that factors like humidity, temperature, and sunlight can affect the material's performance.

Hi all,

I have something to share with you. After much reflection, I have made the difficult decision to leave OpenAl. My six-and-a-half years with the OpenAl team have been an extraordinary privilege. While I'll express my gratitude to many individuals in the coming days, I want to start by thanking Sam and Greg for their trust in me to lead the technical organization and for their support throughout the years. There's never an ideal time to step away from a place one cherishes, yet this moment feels right. Our recent releases of speech-to-speech and OpenAl 01 mark the beginning of a new era in interaction and intelligence - achievements made possible by your ingenuity and craftsmanship. We didn't merely build smarter models, we fundamentally changed how Al systems learn and reason through complex problems. We brought safety research from the theoretical realm into practical applications, creating models that are more robust, aligned, and steerable than ever before. Our work has made cutting-edge Al research intuitive and accessible, developing technology that adapts and evolves based on everyone's input. This success is a testament to our outstanding teamwork, and it is because of your brilliance, your dedication, and your commitment that OpenAl stands at the pinnacle of AI innovation. I'm stepping away because I want to create the time and space to do my own exploration. For now, my primary focus is doing everything in my power to ensure a smooth transition, maintaining the momentum we've built.

I will forever be grateful for the opportunity to build and work alongside this remarkable team. Together, we've pushed the boundaries of scientific understanding in our quest to improve human well-being. While I may no longer be in the trenches with you, I will still be rooting for you all. With deep gratitude for the friendships forged, the triumphs achieved, and most importantly, the challenges overcome together.

Mira



What OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said

Hi All

Mira has been instrumental to OpenAI’s progress and growth the last 6.5 years; she has been a hugely significant factor in our development from an unknown research lab to an important company.

When Mira informed me this morning that she was leaving, I was saddened but of course support her decision. For the past year, she has been building out a strong bench of leaders that will continue our progress.

I also want to share that Bob and Barret have decided to depart OpenAI. Mira, Bob, and Barret made these decisions independently of each other and amicably, but the timing of Mira’s decision was such that it made sense to now do this all at once, so that we can work together for a smooth handover to the next generation of leadership.

I am extremely grateful to all of them for their contributions.

Being a leader at OpenAI is all-consuming. On one hand it’s a privilege to build AGI and be the fastest-growing company that gets to put our advanced research in the hands of hundreds of millions of people. On the other hand it’s relentless to lead a team through it—and they have gone above and beyond the call of duty for the company.

Mark is going to be our new SVP of Research and will now lead the research org in partnership with Jakub as Chief Scientist. This has been our long-term succession plan for Bob someday; although it’s happening sooner than we thought, I couldn’t be more excited that Mark is stepping into the role. Mark obviously has deep technical expertise, but he has also learned how to be a leader and manager in a very impressive way over the past few years.

Josh Achiam is going to take on a new role as Head of Mission Alignment, working across the company to ensure that we get all pieces (and culture) right to be in a place to succeed at the mission.

Kevin and Srinivas will continue to lead the Applied team.

Matt Knight will be our Chief Information Security Officer having already served in this capacity for a long time. This has been our plan for quite some time.

Mark, Jakub, Kevin, Srinivas, Matt, and Josh will report to me. I have over the past year or so spent most of my time on the non-technical parts of our organization; I am now looking forward to spending most of my time on the technical and product parts of the company.

...

Leadership changes are a natural part of companies, especially companies that grow so quickly and are so demanding. I obviously won’t pretend it’s natural for this one to be so abrupt, but we are not a normal company, and I think the reasons Mira explained to me (there is never a good time, anything not abrupt would have leaked, and she wanted to do this while OpenAI was in an upswing) make sense. We can both talk about this more tomorrow during all-hands.

Thank you for all of your hard work and dedication.

Picture abhi baaki hai (The story isn't over yet)

Today, I celebrate 2 years of being in IndiGo (

InterGlobe Aviation

Ltd) and India. On our 18th IndiGo birthday last month, we celebrated many wonderful milestones and unveiled our ambitious plans for coming years. Our story has just started. I am grateful and proud to be a part of this incredible IndiGo journey with my colleagues - giving wings to the nation with over 2,000 daily flights, 430+ domestic and 100+ international routes, and growing every day.

When I had joined, I had shared the quote, ""Wherever you go, becomes a part of you somehow”. Being a part of IndiGo and now living now in India for two years....IndiGo and this beautiful country India have indeed become a part of me. Bharat ab ghar jaisa lagta hai.

India's essence is captured in its beautiful diversity. Of our 88 domestic cities, I had the pleasure of visiting our great teams in 30. From Thiruvananthapuram in the south to Leh in the north. My most recent visit was to Leh, where walking with my son at 18,000 feet at the Khardung La Pass was very special considering my roots are from a country where the highest ""hill"" is some 300 metres only and around 25% of the land is below sea level 😊

Here are some pictures from my travels in the last two years. Can you guess the cities?

Shark Tank judge Anupam Mittal has responded to Indigo CEO Pieter Elbers ’ post celebrating two years of being in India and Indigo. In a LinkedIn post , Elbers wrote “Being a part of IndiGo and now living now in India for two years....IndiGo and this beautiful country India have indeed become a part of me. Bharat ab ghar jaisa lagta hai.” In the post, he also shared photos from his travels to different cities of the country.For those unaware, Pieter Elbers joined Indigo in September 2022.Prior to joining IndiGo, he was the President & Chief Executive Officer of KLM for 8 years. He started his career at KLM in 1992 as Manager Aircraft loading.Mittal replied to the post saying “Aap bhi ab ghar wale jaise lagte ho”. He further added “Good to see u have taken to India”.Take a look at the post here"," Indigo CEO Pieter Elbers celebrated two years of being in India and Indigo.

“The PRC engages in aggressive state-sponsored subsidization of the two primary display technologies: liquid crystal display (LCD) and organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display. By doing so, it drives non-PRC companies from the market and bolsters PRC dominance of the industry. In LCD, the industry’s legacy technology, the PRC’s share of global production capacity has grown from 0% in 2004 to 72% today, and non-PRC manufacturers are rapidly exiting the market due to their inability to compete… A similar evolution is now underway in OLED, the current generation of display technology; the PRC’s share of global production capacity has grown from 1% in 2014 to 51% today.

Most alarmingly, both companies are tied to the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) and support its efforts. Tianma is identified by the U.S. Department of State as a subsidiary of the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC)… BOE was initially founded in 1993 as a military and defence supplier, and it is integrated as at least a subprime contractor for the PLA; many of its customers are known PLA suppliers, such as HiSense.”","The PRC engages in aggressive state-sponsored subsidization of the two primary display technologies: liquid crystal display (LCD) and organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display.

Following reports of scams and black marketing of tickets for Coldplay 's upcoming Music Of The Spheres Tour in India, a formal criminal complaint has been filed against BookMyShow and its key managerial personnel.

Fiewin gaming app scam: What is it and how it worked



What ED said about the scam



""Public-private collaborations are crucial in tackling complex financial crimes. Binance’s specialised investigation team is a great example of how private-sector firms can work closely with law enforcement. In this case, they provided us with analytical support that contributed to the investigation,""

What Binance said about the scam



“This case showcases the critical importance of collaboration between public institutions like the ED and private entities like Binance in addressing the new types of digital threats.”

The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has identified and arrested four individuals in connection with an online gaming app, Fiewin . The app, initially presented as a legitimate platform for users to earn money through games, is now under investigation for its role in defrauding users of over Rs 400 crore. The money was then laundered using digital wallets linked to a global crypto exchange.World’s largest crypto platform Binance claimed that its Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) provided critical intelligence that helped ED in tracing the funds and uncovering the fraud network. According to a report by The Economic Times, the ED probe also discovered that the platform Chinese nationals allegedly operated the illegal betting/gaming app with the help of their Indian accomplices.In a report, Binance explained that the Fiewin app gained traction by promising users the opportunity to earn money easily by playing mini-games. The app allowed new users to quickly create an account and begin participating in the app’s activities, with the option to ""top up"" their in-app balance via various payment methods.However, reports have surfaced suggesting that once users' accounts accumulated substantial funds, the app stopped allowing them to withdraw the funds, leaving them unable to recover their money.An investigation by the ED revealed that Rs 400 crore was stolen through this scheme. This money was transferred into various cryptocurrency addresses, which were later traced back to the operation.Local police across the country began receiving reports from victims who lost funds to the Fiewin app. Due to the growing number of victims reporting the scams, the case was escalated to ED.Through its investigation, ED discovered that the app had been part of a cross-border criminal network it used various methods to obfuscate the origin and movement of illicit funds by utilizing bank accounts of “mules” and cryptocurrency wallets, creating a complex web of transactions to hinder detection and tracing.The investigation has led to the arrest of several individuals who played key roles in facilitating the fraud, working in tandem with handlers linked to Fiewin’s gaming apps. The criminals communicated via privacy-focused messaging apps and operated from various locations, ED added.an ED representative said.Binance Investigation Specialist, Ferdinando D. added.","The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has identified and arrested four individuals in connection with an online gaming app, Fiewin.

IT firms profit from cost-of-living adjustments clause,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/it-firms-profit-from-cost-of-living-adjustments-clause/articleshow/113701361.cms,"For a long time, IT companies hadn’t enforced cost of living adjustments (COLA) because inflation rates remained relatively low. This situation changed when inflation rates surged, putting companies under considerable pressure. They found themselves grappling with higher salaries, especially in India, but were unable to pass on these extra costs to their clients.Sometimes clients believe that they are paying a fair price and would resist price increases.For some time now, the inclusion of COLA clauses in contracts has become a common practice in the industry. These clauses allow companies to adjust their fees based on changes in the cost of living, ensuring that they can maintain their profitability and continue to provide quality services to their clients without bearing the full burden of inflation-driven expenses.At Cognizant, for instance, a cost-of-living adjustment was applied to the compensation of each of their employees residing in a jurisdiction other than its CEO Ravi Kumar ’s principal work location (the United States) to adjust the compensation of such employees to the jurisdiction of Mr Kumar's principal work location. Each such cost-of-living index, including that for India, the location of the worldwide median employee, was used to adjust the applicable compensation of employees to the cost-of-living index for the United States. All cost-of-living indexes used were as published by cost-of-living databases provider Numbeo.com for 2023, Cognizant said in its proxy filing.Peter Bendor-Samuel , CEO of IT research advisory Everest Group, said, “COLA is historically a significant source of profit for the IT firms . It is not shared with employees and is used to support earnings. As market conditions have tightened, it is harder for firms to get COLA into contracts, but where they can, they work hard to ensure that they are in place as they help profitability.”Stanton Jones, distinguished analyst at ISG, said the cost-of-living adjustments were not added to IT services contracts for many years because inflation was low. “However, when inflation spiked, it put a lot of pressure on firms as salaries rose (especially in India) but they were unable to pass these costs on to clients. It’s now regular practice to include these clauses in contracts.”Bendor-Samuel said wage increases for employees are driven by local market conditions and are not connected to COLA adjustments. “COLA is only indirectly linked to wage increases because wage inflation will allow for COLA adjustments. However, if a firm can make COLA adjustments but not increase wages, they will do that. But if there is significant wage inflation, then the COLA provisions will activate. Again, it is becoming harder to get COLA into new contracts as firms are looking for price decreases in the current market.”Jones said in terms of COLA, it’s an index used in multi-year outsourcing relationships to make sure prices for managed services (or rate cards) are aligned with the impact of inflation on operating costs. “Wages are an important part of the operating cost for a provider, but not the only one. Also important to keep in mind that enterprises generally do not have visibility into the specific or even aggregate level of compensation of their provider teams,” he added.","For a long time, IT companies hadn’t enforced cost of living adjustments (COLA) because inflation rates remained relatively low.

Meta AI gets voice

Meta , the parent company of Facebook and Instagram , has announced a suite of generative AI tools for its social media platforms. These tools will empower users to generate and modify images with AI, and even translate videos, opening up new creative possibilities for content creation and engagement.At its annual Meta Connect conference, company CEO Mark Zuckerberg introduced multimodal features to the Llama 3.2 large language models “that make Meta AI and our other AI products more fun, useful and capable.”The company announced that users can also now share photos in chats with Meta AI, and Meta AI can understand the picture, and even answer questions about it.For example, users can share a photo of a flower they saw on a hike and ask Meta AI what kind of flower it is. Or share a photo of a dish and ask Meta AI for instructions on how to cook it.Apart from responding to photos, Meta AI can now help users to edit them. Users can send an image in a chat with Meta AI and tell the chatbot what they want added, removed or changed in the photo – “from changing your outfit to replacing the background with a rainbow”.“And if you want to reshare a photo from feed to your Instagram Story, Meta AI’s new backgrounds feature can take a look at your photo, understand what’s in the image and generate a fun background for the story,” it added.Meta is also testing an AI-powered translation tool that will automatically translate the audio of Reels in different languages.“With automatic dubbing and lip syncing, Meta AI will simulate the speaker’s voice in another language and sync their lips to match,” the company said.Meta is starting with small tests on Instagram and Facebook on videos from Latin America and the US in English and Spanish. The company plans to expand this to more creators and languages.Users can now use their voice to talk to Meta AI on Messenger, Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram DM, and it’ll respond out loud. Users will also be able to choose from different voice options for your assistant, including AI voices of Awkwafina, Dame Judi Dench, John Cena, Keegan Michael Key and Kristen Bell.The company also claimed Meta AI is on track to become the most-used AI assistant in the world by the end of this year, and that more than 400 million people are using Meta AI monthly, with 185 million people using it across our products each week.","Meta AI can now answer questions about photos and help users edit them.

Zerodha chief technical officer (CTO) Kailash Nadh said that he has stopped using Google and other search engines for technical queries. Instead, he “depends on Claude or GPT-4 for technical debugging.” In an interview with Money Control, Nadh said “the idea, especially for technical people, of web search as a medium for finding answers is dying.”“However, new engineers should not depend on GPT to generate code without understanding it.In the short term, it'll work because these things do produce great code but I don't think it’ll automatically make them good engineers without learning the fundamentals,” he further added.He said that generating code is just one aspect of designing a piece of technology. The other aspect, he noted, is understanding the essence of why something is being built. “You have to understand consumer expectations. You have to take bets. You have to factor in business considerations. You have to factor in human psychology.”The CTO further stated “In the very long run — decades or centuries — perhaps these things won't matter anymore as software and technology mature as disciplines but in the medium term, they will absolutely matter.”When asked about his statement that the team's mental health has improved after coming back to the office, Nadh said “the gist of it is that Zerodha's history, culture, and way of working is built on well-balanced interpersonal relationships within teams that fuel collaboration.”“We have always hired people for these traits, and not traits that are essential for remote work to be successful such as effective async remote communication and articulation skills,” he noted, adding “During our remote work years, this fundamental incompatibility took a big toll on the team's mental health and productivity, including mine.”He added “Last year, about over 80 percent of the team reported their mental health to be in a poor state.

User reactions

Harish Sivaramakrishnan , the head of design at CRED , a fintech company , has faced online criticism for his advice to product designers . He suggested that they approach their work with the same intensity as if they were to die the next day.In a video from an event shared on LinkedIn, Sivaramakrishnan was seen urging designers to approach their work with the same intensity as if it were their last day.Expressing frustration with the ""slack attitude"" among designers, he emphasised the importance of investing time and effort in their work. Sivaramakrishnan encouraged designers to take pride in their work and avoid rushing through projects. However, his remarks were met with mixed reactions, with most criticising his opinion.In the video, Sivaramakrishnan said, “If you were to die the next day, you should be insanely proud of the detail that you drove into that release. Now the detail you can drive in the release which gives you only like two and a half weeks of sprint time, will not look like a release that you can do in two and a half years. I am aware, you’re aware, so that’s not the point. But there is a general slack attitude which says, ‘Quickly get something done,’ quickly you can’t get anything done. So my point is just to put in that right effort. Write the best copy you can, get the best visual design you can, get the best transition design you can, get the best API optimisation you can. To become that product that you really want, but attitudinally are you a person saying, ‘Quickly kuch bana ke phataphat se test kar dete hain,’ is the worst way to build. I haven’t seen a single product that has worked like that.""Many users found the advice insensitive and inappropriate , especially given the potential for it to trigger negative emotions in those who may be struggling with personal challenges. Here are some user reactions:“On my deathbed, I'd be so worried about how I could have maximised shareholder value more than t hinking about my loved ones . On a lighter note, I sure hope I am not thinking about the details of the products I shipped on my death bed✌️Although I think many of my PRDs may potentially be lethal. For me.”“Love this perspective! Although, if I were to die the very next day, I'd probably be more concerned about finishing my bucket list than the details in my product. But hey, that's just me. Keep up the great work, Harish!”","Harish Sivaramakrishnan is the head of design at CRED, a fintech company.

Making the best use of AI

By: - Peter Jayaseelan, Vice President & Managing Director- South Asia and Channels (APAC), Jabra

Across India, companies are embracing the return to the office, with a staggering 96% implementing full or partial in-person work models. But what would you say if I told you that only 1 in 10 workspaces are equipped effectively? Technical errors, glitches, sluggish video, and muffled voices hamper employee's workflow and productivity. Therefore, we must reimagine our collaboration strategies to ensure meetings become well-oiled engines of productivity, driving success in the era of the hybrid workplace.Introducing innovative solutions to our work set-ups will help us stay competitive in the dynamic business landscape while facilitating effortless communication amongst teams.Collectively as a workforce, we spend millions of minutes due to technical meeting issues – and the increase in online meetings since the pandemic hasn’t made it any bit easier. The return to the office has disrupted online meeting habits, necessitating a shift from meeting room usage to accommodate hybrid work interactions. Video solutions are essential, but mastering hybrid meetings requires technology that fosters, not hinders productivity. As per a report on hybrid work reveals that 1/3 of employees struggle with meeting room tech and 50% would choose the laptop at their desks over a video-equipped meeting room. Only 1 in 10 meeting rooms are equipped with video. And even when they are, people aren’t comfortable with using them. Here training on video tech and hybrid meeting etiquette is crucial to bridge the gap and unlock the potential of hybrid meetings. I suggest a two-pronged approach to do this:New tech requires new training. Employees often struggle to manage busy workdays, making it challenging to navigate video solutions before the meeting. So, training sessions are a good way to onboard your employees on to your new meeting room solution. Today, brands are integrating AI to their devices to enhance user experience. So, understanding the tech behind the product may help employees to work smarter and more efficiently. If unfamiliar with in-room technology, remote participants may feel excluded.A simple reminder can go along way as the ultimate motive is to help and support workers in their daily collaboration. I recommend posting a physical instruction guide in the meeting room or a QR code linking to instructions, so it’s easy and quick for the employees to work the room – and the video equipment.While one battle is to get your employees to use your video-equipped meeting rooms , our research reveals that only 15% of office meeting rooms are equipped with video. Therefore, we must redesign and optimize meetings rooms with video to enable better hybrid meeting experiences. Here are the top 5 considerations to be made:Meetings should be equitable for all participants – whether in the room or remote. Ensure the meeting room technology brings remote participants into the room and in-room participants to them.You can’t optimize your meeting rooms if you think of room layout and technology separately. Be sure to consider how the video camera’s field of view is like and how it best captures everyone in the room, when doing the room layout.As already mentioned, ensure that your employees are dressed to impress when it comes to mastering the technology. Equip them with training and guides, so your redesigned meeting rooms aren’t ghosted by your employees.Top-quality technology leads to trust which is typically more difficult to establish remotely than it is in person. As per our LSE study, meeting participants reported much greater levels of overall trust and clarity when utilizing and experiencing professional technology. There was a 27% increase in technology clarity, leading to 16% more trust, 35% greater expressiveness, and a 47% perceived improvement in the quality of input. Organizations must therefore recognize how vital professional technology is for enhancing employee engagement and productivity in hybrid meetings.AI is on the rise. The tech product we rely on for our day-to-day tasks now integrates AI, offering enhanced productivity and unique experiences for the users - from your laptops to your headphones to even your personal tech gadgets. For example – a feature like IntelliFrame offers users multiple video streams, face and voice recognition – revolutionizing meeting experiences. Therefore, it is important that we stay ahead of the curve and adapt to the ever-evolving landscape to prepare ourselves for the future of work.New technology is rarely an easy transition and adoption, but a little effort to smoothen the process can take you far. Leveraging the potential of AI along with choosing the right tech upgrades for your work setup or organization can not only optimize meeting rooms but also improve meetings and meeting efficiency significantly.

"Mark Zuckerberg reveals $10,000 Orion AR Glasses prototype at Meta Connect",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/mark-zuckerberg-reveals-10000-orion-ar-glasses-prototype-at-meta-connect/articleshow/113688259.cms,"Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg unveiled Orion, a prototype of advanced augmented reality (AR) glasses, at the company's annual Connect event. Described as ""the most advanced glasses the world has ever seen,"" Orion represents a significant leap in AR technology , combining a wide field of view with a compact form factor.The Orion glasses feature Micro LED projectors built into the frames, creating a 70-degree field of view holographic display.This allows users to see digital content seamlessly blended with the physical world. Control is achieved through a combination of eye tracking, hand gestures, and a neural interface wristband. The glasses are powered by custom silicon designed by Meta, with components packed down to a fraction of a millimetre.While not yet ready for consumer release, Orion demonstrates Meta's progress in miniaturising AR technology. The glasses are noticeably smaller than competitors like Snap's recently announced Spectacles 5 . However, with current production costs estimated at $10,000 per unit, significant work remains to make Orion commercially viable.Meta is positioning Orion as a successor to its Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, which have seen surprising success. The company envisions Orion enabling a range of applications, from multitasking with virtual windows to big-screen entertainment and life-size holograms of people.Development of Orion has been ongoing for a decade, with Meta facing numerous technical challenges. The company had initially planned for a 2024 consumer release but shelved those plans in 2022 due to high costs.For now, Meta will use Orion for internal development and external demonstrations while working towards more affordable versions. Zuckerberg expressed optimism about bringing Orion-like glasses to market ""within a few years"" at prices comparable to “current smartphones and laptops,” as noted by The Verge.In addition to Orion, Meta announced several other products at Connect 2024, including a $300 Quest 3S mixed reality headset and updates to its Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses. The company also showcased advancements in its AI assistant and expanded AR features across its social media platforms.","Orion is a prototype of advanced augmented reality (AR) glasses.
