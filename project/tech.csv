How cybercriminals fool buyers

How to stay safe

Ecommerce major Amazon is all set to host its annual Prime Day sale. Amazon Prime Day Sale will start at midnight on July 20, 2024. However, cybercriminals leverage this occasion to carry out phishing attacks , preying on unsuspecting shoppers. These attackers employ deceptive tactics, such as sending fake emails or creating fraudulent websites, aiming to steal personal information or financial credentials.While Prime Day offers incredible savings, it is crucial for shoppers to remain vigilant, exercise caution while clicking on links or providing sensitive information, and ensure they are navigating legitimate platforms.Ahead of Amazon Prime Day in July 2024, Checkpoint observed a significant increase in cyberattacks related to Amazon Brand. The security solutions provider also listed 25 malicious websites. The list includes:- amazon-onboarding[.]com* amazonmxc[.]shop* amazonindo[.]com* shopamazon2[.]com* microsoft-amazon[.]shop* amazonapp[.]nl* shopamazon3[.]com* amazon-billing[.]top* amazonshop1[.]com* fedexamazonus[.]top* amazonupdator[.]com* amazon-in[.]net* espaces-amazon-fr[.]com* usiamazon[.]com* amazonhafs[.]buzz* usps-amazon-us[.]top* amazon-entrega[.]info* amazon-vip[.]xyz* paqueta-amazon[.]com* connect-amazon[.]com* user-amazon-id[.]com* amazon762[.]cc* amazoneuroslr[.]com* amazonw-dwfawpapf[.]top* amazonprimevidéo[.]comFraudsters use phishing technique to fool the customers. Phishing attacks often begin with a message sent via email, social media, or other electronic communication means. Cybercriminals use public resources like social networks to gather background information about their victims, which helps them craft convincing fake messages. These messages typically contain malicious attachments or links to fake websites that appear to be owned by trusted entities like Amazon.To help online shoppers stay safe this year, Check Point researchers have outlined practical security and safety tips:1. Check URLs carefully: Be wary of misspellings or sites using a different top-level domain (e.g., .co instead of .com). These copycat sites may look attractive but are designed to steal your data.2. Create strong passwords: Ensure your Amazon.com password is strong and uncrackable before Prime Day to protect your account.3. Look for HTTPS: Verify that the website URL starts with https:// and has a padlock icon, indicating a secure connection.4. Limit personal information: Avoid sharing unnecessary personal details like your birthday or social security number with online retailers.5. Be cautious with emails: Phishing attacks often use urgent language to trick you into clicking links or downloading attachments. Always verify the source.6. Skeptical of unrealistic deals: If a deal seems too good to be true, it likely is. Trust your instincts and avoid suspicious offers.7. Use credit cards: Prefer credit cards over debit cards for online shopping as they offer better protection and less liability if stolen.","Amazon Prime Day Sale will start at midnight on July 20, 2024.

Microsoft is testing this AI model that they think is “too risky” to launch,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-is-testing-this-ai-model-that-they-think-is-too-risky-to-launch/articleshow/111760603.cms,"Two enhancements in VALL-E 2 models

Why Microsoft is not planning to launch it for the public

Microsoft has published a research project showing off the second generation of VALL-E speech Al model that can simulate any voice from an audio sample. Called VALL-E 2 , the model brings two significant enhancements over its predecessor to enhance its performance.“VALL-E 2 is the latest advancement in neural codec language models that marks a milestone in zero-shot text-to-speech synthesis (TTS), achieving human parity for the first time,” the company said.Microsoft says that VALL-E 2 builds on the foundation laid by VALL-E, and brings Repetition Aware Sampling and Grouped Code Modeling .The Repetition Aware Sampling refines the original nucleus sampling process by accounting for token repetition in the decoding history and stabilises the decoding. The Grouped Code Modeling organises codec codes into groups to effectively shorten the sequence length. This boosts inference speed and addresses the challenges of long sequence modelling.“Our experiments, conducted on the LibriSpeech and VCTK datasets, have shown that VALL-E 2 surpasses previous zero-shot TTS systems in speech robustness, naturalness, and speaker similarity. It is the first of its kind to reach human parity on these benchmarks,” Microsoft said.Microsoft researchers say that VALL-E 2 is purely a research project. They note that while the model may be used for educational learning, entertainment, journalistic, self-authored content, accessibility features, interactive voice response systems, translation chatbot and so on, it has a fair share of risks.“While VALL-E 2 can speak in a voice like the voice talent, the similarity, and naturalness depend on the length and quality of the speech prompt, the background noise, as well as other factors. It may carry potential risks in the misuse of the model, such as spoofing voice identification or impersonating a specific speaker,” the company noted.The company stated that all experiments involving this model are conducted with the assumption that the user agrees to be the target speaker and the speaker's consent has been obtained.",Microsoft has published a research project showing off the second generation of VALL-E speech Al model that can simulate any voice from an audio sample.

Reported issues with Intel’s 13th and 14th Gen Raptor Lake CPUs

A game developer has criticised Intel’s 13th and 14th Gen CPUs, calling them “defective”. Matthew Cassell , the founder of Alderon Games , has said that the US-based chipmaker “is selling defective 13th-14th Gen CPUs”.“My team at Alderon Games, working on the multiplayer dinosaur survival game Path of Titans, has been encountering significant problems with Intel CPU stability.These issues, including crashes, instability, and memory corruption, are confined to the 13th and 14th generation processors. Despite all released microcode, BIOS, and firmware updates, the problem remains unresolved,” he said in a post.According to the founder, the developer has identified failures in five main areas:He claims that CPUs initially working well deteriorate over time eventually failing, an observation recorded for over the last 3–4 months. He also noted that the failure rate observed from the company’s own testing is nearly 100%.“This issue is gaining attention from news outlets and has been noted by Fortnite and RAD Game Tools, which powers decompression behind Unreal Engine,” Cassell noted, adding, “Users are also receiving misleading error messages about running out of video driver memory, despite having sufficient memory.”Cassell said that the company is swapping all its servers to AMD, “which experience 100 times fewer crashes compared to Intel CPUs that were found to be defective” to “prevent further harm to our game”.Earlier this year, reports suggested that people are having problems with 13th Generation Raptor Lake and 14th Generation Raptor Lake Refresh chips. The US-based chipmaker then addressed issues blaming the actions by motherboard manufacturers, saying that these manufacturers are operating the CPUs outside of Intel's recommended settings. Intel issued a statement saying that these modifications can lead to instability.",A game developer has criticised Intel’s 13th and 14th Gen CPUs.

Why Home ministry and IT ministry want control of India’s cybersecurity agency,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-home-ministry-and-it-ministry-want-control-of-indias-cybersecurity-agency/articleshow/111759042.cms,"What is MHA's Argument for Control

What is IT Ministry's Counter Argument

Two key ministries in India are reportedly strongly pitching for control over the country's nodal cybersecurity watchdog, the Computer Emergency Response Team (Cert-In). According to a report in The Indian Express, quoting sources, the Information Technology ministry and Ministry of Home Affairs are making a strong pitch for the ownership of Cert-In .Currently, Cert-In falls under the administrative control of the Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology ( IT Ministry ). However, the Ministry of Home Affairs ( MHA ) is making a strong case for taking over its ownership.This disagreement highlights the growing complexity of cybersecurity, particularly when dealing with online harms. It underscores the need for various stakeholders with differing approaches and mandates to collaborate effectively.The Information Technology (Amendment) Act 2008 designated Cert-In as the national agency for cybersecurity. Its responsibilities include information collection, analysis, and dissemination regarding cyber incidents, issuing forecasts and alerts, recommending emergency measures, and coordinating cyber incident response activities.The MHA already has a dedicated cybersecurity agency , the Indian Cyber-crime Coordination Centre (I4C). However, I4C's focus is primarily on cybercrimes and improving coordination between law enforcement agencies. Bringing Cert-In under the MHA could potentially address the technical expertise gap within their existing agency.The MHA reportedly argues that bringing Cert-In under its wing would enhance law enforcement's ability to investigate cybercrimes. They believe Cert-In's technical expertise would streamline investigations, especially considering the agency's enforcement powers.The MHA believes that controlling Cert-In would allow them to directly leverage its technical expertise, potentially streamlining investigations for various law enforcement agencies. Some officials, however, are also reported to view this push as a bureaucratic power struggle.The IT ministry counters that Cert-In's primary function – incident reporting, malware alerts, and security infrastructure improvement – is highly technical in nature. They argue that Cert-In's responsibilities extend far beyond the scope of law enforcement.A government official cited in the report pointed out that Cert-In has limited investigative powers compared to law enforcement agencies. They lack the authority to conduct searches and seizures, hindering their ability to carry out full-fledged investigations.Another official, speaking anonymously, attributed the issue to the ambiguity in the Allocation of Business Rules (AoBR). Cybersecurity is not solely assigned to any one ministry, with agencies under the Prime Minister's Office, Home Ministry, and IT Ministry handling various aspects.","Two key ministries in India are reportedly pitching for control over the country's nodal cybersecurity watchdog.

Verdict

Motorola expanded its Edge series in India recently with the launch of Motorola Edge 50 Fusion . Over the years, Motorola’s Edge series smartphones have become popular for their design and performance in terms of camera and display. The Edge 50 Fusion is no exception. It features a vegan leather texture on the rear and premium-looking colours.The smartphone runs Qualcomm Snapdragon 7s Gen 2 processor and comes with a starting price of Rs 22,999 (base variant).Motorola Edge 50 Fusion packs a host of features like Dolby Atmos surround sound, AI-powered shot optimization and audio zoom. We used the device for sometime and here’s our reviewWith the vegan leather back, Motorola Edge 50 Fusion gives a premium tactile experience. The smartphone is offered in three colour options – Forest Blue, Marshmallow Blue and Hot Pink. We got the Marshmallow Blue variant for review which looks good and further adds to the premiumness of the device.The leather back gives a sturdy hand grip of the Edge 50 Fusion without worrying for any scratches and dust. Motorola ships a pantone inspired cover with the phone. While Motorola provides a complimentary back cover, it's worth noting that it might slightly affect the phone's grip and feel.Motorola Edge 50 Fusion comes with curved edges on the front. There is a punch-hole display camera at the front. While the rear has a dual camera setup with large sensors aligned vertically. The LED flash light is placed beside the sensors.Weighing 175 grams, Motorola Edge 50 Fusion is a comparatively lightweight device. Left edge of the phone features three buttons – volume increase and decrease button placed above the power button. The bottom edge houses the Type-C port along with speakers, microphone and SIM tray slot.Overall, the smartphone looks premium for its price with a subtle design and colour. Having said that, we recommend using a back cover with the phone as it tends to get dirty easily.Motorola Edge 50 Fusion has a 6.67-inch full HD screen with 144Hz refresh rate and 2400x1080p resolution. The display is good with satisfactory colour production. However, the display lacks support for HDR. Nevertheless, the viewing experience is decent with deep contrast and punchy colours.The smartphone features adaptive brightness and adjusts itself as per the surrounding light. We did not face any issue while using the phone outdoors. Another feature worthy of mentioning is the edge lighting on Motorola Edge 50 Fusion that lights up the edges while receiving a notification or a call.The handset is also equipped with another feature called flicker prevention. Enabling it prevents the screen from flickering in dark environments. The phone is said to offer up to 600 nits of peak brightness which can be adjusted as well.Motorola Edge 50 Fusion comes powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 7s Gen 2 chipset with 4nm process. The smartphone has an octa-core CPU with four high-performance Arm Cortex-A78 cores clocked at 2.4Ghz speed. It is paired with four power-efficient Cortex-A55 cores at a clock speed of 1.95GHz. For graphics, Motorola Edge 50 Fusion has Adreno 710 GPU. The device was able to efficiently handle day-to-day tasks. We did not face any noticeable lag in the daily performance of the device. The handset can handle moderate gaming, though it tends to heat up during prolonged gaming sessions.Motorola Edge 50 Fusion packs up to 12GB RAM and up to 256GB internal storage capacity. The smartphone runs on Android 14 based Motorola’s Hello UI skin on the top. The phone has a comparatively clean UI with no third-party apps. Although you will find some Motorola’s own system apps. The company is giving three major Android OS updates with the phone in addition to four years of security patch, which is good if you are looking to buy a smartphone for prolonged years.One thing that got us worried was that the display, at times, does not immediately wake up when tapped on the locked screen.Coming to the audio of the Motorola Edge 50 Fusion, we really liked the sound quality. Equipped with Dolby Atmos surround sound, it manages to deliver an immersive audio experience. The handset also boasts of Spatial Audio which works with compatible media contents only. Users can also customize the audio settings for music, gaming, movies or podcasts. There is also a smart audio feature that identifies the content and performs automatic adjustments. You can also connect your smartphone to your TV and select advanced settings for the connected device.Motorola Edge 50 Fusion also has a Live Caption feature. Once enabled, it can detect speech on the device and automatically generate captions. The feature is available with a software update.Motorola Edge 50 Fusion has a dual camera setup on the back. There is a 50MP Sony Lytia700 C main sensor paired with a 13MP ultra-wide secondary sensor. During our review, we found the images to be slightly oversaturated with enhanced colours and contrast. Images captured using the phone are generally warm with a yellowish tint.The main sensor supports optical image stabilization (OIS) which reduces motion blur in the images. Photos captured in low-light are decent. There is enough detail in the image without any unnecessary noise.The 13MP ultra-wide camera gives a satisfactory performance in capturing wide-angle shots. For selfies and video calls, the phone has a 32MP camera at the front with f/2.4 aperture. Selfies captured by Motorola Edge 50 Fusion are good. The images do not look artificial. There is a slight skin tone correction, but not to the extent that it deviates from reality. The phone struggles to capture photos in the indoor artificial lighting using the front camera. Though no such issue was faced for outdoor images.The UI of the camera app is easy to navigate through. Camera features like portrait, slow motion, Pro mode and others are available right on the screen. So you don’t have to struggle to find them. We noticed that there is a lack of depth in the portrait shots with not satisfactory image detection.Motorola Edge 50 Fusion is backed by a 5,000mAh battery. The company ships a 68watt charger inside the box with a USB Type-C to Type-C charging cable. The phone can easily last a full day easily on a single charge. It takes almost an hour to fully charge the device.Some of the battery features on the phone include adaptive battery that limit battery for apps that are not in use. There is also a charge boost that can optimize charging by increasing the charging speed. However, the phone tends to heat up with this feature. Battery safety features are optimized charging and overcharge protection.Motorola Edge 50 Fusion delivers a striking balance between performance, camera and design. Packed with mid-range Snapdragon processor, Sony camera sensor and vegan leather back, the smartphone ticks most boxes. At Rs 22,999, the company has carved out a niche for Motorola Edge 50 Fusion, offering compelling features at an affordable price tag.",Motorola Edge 50 Fusion has a 6.67-inch full HD screen with 144Hz refresh rate and 2400x1080p resolution. There is a punch-hole display camera at the front. While the rear has a dual camera setup with large sensors aligned vertically.

UK government’s guidance on smartphone use by kids

In a major move, a posh boarding school in the UK has decided to swap its students’ smartphones for the classic Nokia phones, reports CBS News.

Prince William and Harry, Ian Fleming, Tom Hiddleston and novelist George Orwell are some of its notable alumni.As per the report, parents of first-year students at Eton College were informed about the changes in a letter. It reportedly said that the incoming 13-year-old boarders must transfer their SIM cards to offline Nokia phones given by schools. The phone will only be able to make phone calls and send text messages.The report quotes a school spokesperson who said “Eton routinely reviews our mobile phone and devices policy to balance the benefits and challenges that technology brings to schools.” He further added that those joining in Year 9, essentially the equivalent of freshman year in high school for American students, “will receive a 'brick' phone for use outside the school day, as well as a school-issued iPad to support academic study.”According to Ofcom, the UK government's communications regulator, 97% of children have their own smartphone phone by the age of 12. In the new guidelines issued in February this year, the government advised all schools to “have a behaviour policy which is aligned with the school’s legal duties and standards relating to the welfare of children.

Google Fi wireless has introduced a security feature called ‘ Number Lock ’. This new feature empowers users to take control and prevent a growing cybersecurity threat – SIM swapping .SIM swapping occurs when a malicious actor convinces your carrier to transfer your phone number to a new SIM card in their possession. This can grant them access to your calls, texts, two-factor authentication codes, and potentially even financial accounts linked to your number.Google Fi's Number Lock acts as a digital safeguard against SIM swapping attempts.Once activated, this feature essentially locks your phone number to your existing SIM card. Any attempts to transfer your number to a new SIM, even through contacting customer service, will be denied unless you disable Number Lock. Enabling this feature provides an extra layer of security, making it significantly harder for fraudsters to hijack your phone number.Activating Number Lock is a simple process. Google Fi users can manage the feature through their online account or the Fi app. Once enabled, you'll receive a confirmation notification, giving you peace of mind that your number is locked and protected.","Google Fi's Number Lock acts as a digital safeguard against SIM swapping attempts.
