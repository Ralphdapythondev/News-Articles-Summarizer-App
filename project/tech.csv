Microsoft job cuts at mixed reality division

Microsoft is reportedly laying off more than 1,000 employees across different businesses, a report has said. The cuts come after significant rounds of layoffs at Microsoft, when the company announced it will cut 10,000 roles throughout 2023.Citing people familiar with the situation, The Information reported that “most of the job cuts are within the company’s Strategic Missions and Technologies org, which aims to sell Microsoft’s cloud software and server rentals for businesses with highly specified needs such as telecom firms and space companies.”Microsoft is also cutting jobs in its mixed reality unit but will continue to support the HoloLens 2 augmented reality device.The company said that the cuts “are a necessary and regular part of managing our business” as Microsoft focuses on hiring “in strategic growth areas.”“Earlier today we announced a restructuring of the Microsoft’s Mixed Reality organisation. We remain fully committed to the Department of Defense’s IVAS program and will continue to deliver cutting edge technology to support our soldiers. In addition, we will continue to invest in W365 to reach the broader Mixed Reality hardware ecosystem. We will continue to sell HoloLens 2 while supporting existing HoloLens 2 customers and partners,” a spokesperson said in an email sent to CNBC.Microsoft also reaffirmed its commitment to Mesh, a feature allowing headset wearers to join 3D video calls in Teams alongside colleagues on any device. During last year’s Microsoft Ignite conference in November, company CEO Satya Nadella said that the company's focus is on ""reimagining how employees connect and collaborate,"" regardless of their device (PC, HoloLens, Meta headset, etc.).","Microsoft reportedly laying off more than 1,000 employees across different businesses.

Netflix will stop working on these Apple TV models,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/netflix-will-stop-working-on-these-apple-tv-models/articleshow/110712113.cms,"Why Netflix is pulling support from these devices

“Obsolete” Apple products

Netflix has announced that it will no longer work on the second and third-generation Apple TVs. These models came out more than a decade ago and do not have Apple’s App Store.According to a report by MacRumor, Netflix said in an email to customers that the move is meant to “maintain the best possible Netflix experience” and the change will happen after July 31. The company also updated its support page.“Netflix will no longer be available on Apple TV (2nd generation) and Apple TV (3rd generation) after July 31, 2024,” the page said.The first three generations of Apple TVs are already considered “obsolete” by Apple. This happens when Apple discontinues service for hardware, which is seven years after it has stopped selling a product.Previously, Netflix stopped support for other old devices, including Samsung and Vizio smart TVs as well as first-generation Roku boxes in 2019.Netflix previously announced that it has no intention of developing a native app for the Apple Vision Pro headset and won't allow users to run the iPad version of its app on the Apple Vision Pro either.Apple Vision Pro boasts running millions of iPhone and iPad apps but Netflix as well as developers are opting out. Users will have to access Netflix through the Safari web browser, similar to how it works on Macs.“Our members will be able to enjoy Netflix on the web browser on the Vision Pro, similar to how our members can enjoy Netflix on Macs,” Netflix told Bloomberg in a statement.","Netflix will no longer work on the second and third-generation Apple TVs.

Read: Letter by current and former ChatGPT-maker OpenAI employees ‘warning’ about advanced AI,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/read-letter-by-current-and-former-chatgpt-maker-openai-employees-warning-about-advanced-ai/articleshow/110711942.cms,"Here’s the letter:

We are current and former employees at frontier AI companies, and we believe in the potential of AI technology to deliver unprecedented benefits to humanity.

We also understand the serious risks posed by these technologies. These risks range from the further entrenchment of existing inequalities, to manipulation and misinformation, to the loss of control of autonomous AI systems potentially resulting in human extinction. AI companies themselves have acknowledged these risks [1, 2, 3], as have governments across the world [4, 5, 6] and other AI experts [7, 8, 9].

We are hopeful that these risks can be adequately mitigated with sufficient guidance from the scientific community, policymakers, and the public. However, AI companies have strong financial incentives to avoid effective oversight, and we do not believe bespoke structures of corporate governance are sufficient to change this.

AI companies possess substantial non-public information about the capabilities and limitations of their systems, the adequacy of their protective measures, and the risk levels of different kinds of harm. However, they currently have only weak obligations to share some of this information with governments, and none with civil society. We do not think they can all be relied upon to share it voluntarily.

So long as there is no effective government oversight of these corporations, current and former employees are among the few people who can hold them accountable to the public. Yet broad confidentiality agreements block us from voicing our concerns, except to the very companies that may be failing to address these issues. Ordinary whistleblower protections are insufficient because they focus on illegal activity, whereas many of the risks we are concerned about are not yet regulated. Some of us reasonably fear various forms of retaliation, given the history of such cases across the industry. We are not the first to encounter or speak about these issues.

We therefore call upon

advanced AI

companies to commit to these principles:

That the company will not enter into or enforce any agreement that prohibits “disparagement” or criticism of the company for risk-related concerns, nor retaliate for risk-related criticism by hindering any vested economic benefit;

That the company will facilitate a verifiably anonymous process for current and former employees to raise risk-related concerns to the company’s board, to regulators, and to an appropriate independent organization with relevant expertise;

That the company will support a culture of open criticism and allow its current and former employees to raise risk-related concerns about its technologies to the public, to the company’s board, to regulators, or to an appropriate independent organization with relevant expertise, so long as trade secrets and other intellectual property interests are appropriately protected;

That the company will not retaliate against current and former employees who publicly share risk-related confidential information after other processes have failed. We accept that any effort to report risk-related concerns should avoid releasing confidential information unnecessarily. Therefore, once an adequate process for anonymously raising concerns to the company’s board, to regulators, and to an appropriate independent organization with relevant expertise exists, we accept that concerns should be raised through such a process initially. However, as long as such a process does not exist, current and former employees should retain their freedom to report their concerns to the public.

A group of current and former employees at ChatGPT-maker OpenAI have written a letter citing concerns about the potential risks posed by these technologies. They acknowledge the potential benefits of AI but warn of dangers like increased inequality, manipulation, and loss of control over AI systems.This group of employees believe AI companies have a financial incentive to avoid oversight and don't share enough information about the risks with the public. Furthermore, they argue that current protections to whistleblowers are inadequate and confidentiality agreements prevent them from speaking out.They also propose principles for AI companies to adopt, including allowing employees to raise concerns anonymously and publicly without fear of retaliation.","A group of current and former employees at ChatGPT-maker OpenAI have written a letter citing concerns about the potential risks posed by these technologies.

How Amazon is using AI to minimise package returns of these items,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-amazon-is-using-ai-to-minimise-package-returns-of-these-items/articleshow/110711419.cms,"How Amazon Project P.I. works

Amazon Project P.I. availability

Amazon is using an AI tool that scans items for defects to ensure that products that are being shipped do not have any issues, thereby reducing the number returns that may arise from defected deliveries. The company has an AI model named “Project P.I.,” which stands for “private investigator,” that uses detective-like tools to scan items for defects.“By leveraging AI and product imaging within our operations facilities, we are able to efficiently detect potentially damaged products and address more of those issues before they ever reach a customer, which is a win for the customer, our selling partners, and the environment,” said Dharmesh Mehta, vice president of Worldwide Selling Partner Services at Amazon.Project P.I. combines generative AI and computer vision to uncover hidden flaws – such as damaged products, wrong colours, or incorrect sizes – all flagged before reaching your doorstep. Not only just identify problems, Amazon’s Project P.I. digs deeper and helps pinpoint the root cause of issues, allowing Amazon to implement preventative measures and stop defects from recurring.Once Amazon associates review the product with Project P.I., they then decide whether the item is eligible to be resold at a discounted price as part of Amazon’s Second Chance site, donate it or find another use for it.The model, which essentially serves as an extra pair of eyes for Amazon associates, is being used at several fulfilment centres in North America, and is expected to expand to additional sites throughout 2024.“AI is helping Amazon ensure that we’re not just delighting customers with high-quality items, but we’re extending that customer obsession to our sustainability work by preventing less-than-perfect items from leaving our facilities, and helping us avoid unnecessary carbon emissions due to transportation, packaging, and other steps in the returns process,” added Kara Hurst, vice president of Worldwide Sustainability at Amazon.Amazon also says that it is also leveraging a generative AI system in parallele that uses a Multi-Modal LLM (MLLM) to investigate the root cause of negative customer experiences.","Amazon is using an AI tool that scans items for defects to ensure that products that are being shipped do not have any issues.

An APK teardown reported by Android Authority of the Google app v15.22.29.29.arm64 (beta) reveals that users may soon be able to add context to their searches more easily by long-pressing the shutter button and simultaneously providing additional information through voice input .Currently, when conducting an image search using Google Lens, users need to press the shutter button to start the search and then tap on the voice search icon to add context, which can be in the form of voice or text input. With the upcoming changes, users will be able to streamline this process by simply holding down the shutter button to record their voice and provide additional context at the same time.The teardown also suggests that Google Lens may introduce a new ""Search with video"" feature, allowing users to record a video instead of just capturing a picture and then adding additional search context through voice. Although this feature is not yet functional, it could provide a more dynamic and informative way for users to search for information based on their surroundings.These new features are not currently live within Google Lens but may be rolled out in the future. The easier context search could be a stepping stone towards future Google Glass-like products, similar to the smart AI Glasses showcased during a recent Google I/O demo.While the APK teardown helps predict upcoming features based on work-in-progress code, it is important to note that these predicted features may not always make it to a public release.

Google Search is taking a step towards providing users with a more comprehensive weather experience. The familiar Weather card displayed on mobile search results now incorporates air quality information, allowing users to see both the temperature and how breathable the air is at a glance.Earlier, the Weather card focused on core weather data like temperature, precipitation chances, and wind. The inclusion of air quality adds another layer of vital information, especially for users living in areas prone to smog or pollution.The air quality information appears at the bottom of the Weather card. While it doesn't include the specific Air Quality Index ( AQI ) number, it uses a colour-coded system to indicate good, moderate, or unhealthy air quality. This quick visual cue allows users to make informed decisions about their outdoor activities.Tapping on the Weather card still directs users to a full weather page with a dedicated air quality section, displaying the AQI and other relevant metrics.Air quality data is already available in Google Maps , the At a Glance widget, and on Assistant-powered devices.The rollout of air quality information within the Weather card might not be immediate for all users.

Microsoft Threat Intelligence report warns that gift cards are an attractive target due to the lack of personal information attached to them, making them ideal for fraud and social engineering schemes.The report highlights a specific threat actor group, Storm-0539 (also known as Atlas Lion), which has been particularly active around major US holidays. In the lead-up to Memorial Day 2024, Microsoft observed a 30% increase in activity from this group, suggesting a potential surge in attacks during peak shopping seasons.This cybercrime group has been active since late 2021 and demonstrates a concerning evolution. Previously focused on compromising point-of-sale systems to steal credit card data, they've shifted to targeting cloud and identity services. The aim is to infiltrate the payment systems of large retailers, luxury brands, and fast food restaurants to steal or manipulate gift cards.What makes Storm-0539 particularly dangerous is their sophisticated approach. They exploit their deep understanding of cloud environments to scout out organizations' gift card systems and employee access points. Their methods mirror those of nation-state attackers, granting them persistent access to create and steal gift cards for illicit purposes.To avoid detection, Storm-0539 utilizes deceptive tactics. They pose as legitimate organizations, acquiring cloud resources under the guise of non-profits. They even create fake websites with misleading domain names to lure unsuspecting victims.For organizations issuing gift cards, vigilance is key. Treat gift card portals as high-value targets and implement continuous monitoring for suspicious activity. Multi-factor authentication and strong access controls are crucial to hinder these attackers. Additionally, investing in cloud security best practices and educating staff on social engineering tactics are essential lines of defense.","Gift cards are an attractive target due to the lack of personal information attached to them, making them ideal for fraud and social engineering schemes.

How setting your AC to the default temperature is important



Humidity can force you to decrease temperature



Proper airflow will cool your room faster



Smart ACs can add to convenience



Finding the perfect balance between staying cool and maintaining energy efficiency becomes a priority as the scorching summer heat takes hold. There is one question that often arises among users: What is the ideal temperature for the air conditioning (AC) while sleeping?Well, the answer isn’t straightforward. Let us explain…A government advisory has shared in consultation with the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) fixed the default temperature according to new energy performance standards for Room Air Conditioner (RACs)., the advisory says.Setting the right temperature while sleeping can also help you save your electricity bills . Air conditioners consume more energy to maintain lower temperatures. The closer the indoor temperature is to the outdoor temperature, the less the AC has to work, resulting in lower energy consumption.By setting your AC to an optimal temperature while you sleep, you can significantly reduce energy usage and save on electricity bills . Also, setting the temperature to 18 won’t make your AC cool faster but will consume more electricity. So it’s better to keep the AC in its default temperature.High humidity can make a room feel warmer than it is. Using a dehumidifier alongside your AC can help maintain a comfortable environment.Proper air circulation can enhance the cooling effect of your AC. Consider using a ceiling fan or a portable fan to help distribute cool air more evenly.Smart ACs can be controlled through your smartphone and will allow you to set different temperatures for different times of the day. You can program it to cool your bedroom just before bedtime and raise the temperature slightly as you wake up.","A government advisory has shared in consultation with the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) fixed the default temperature according to new energy performance standards.

As India undergoes its largest democratic exercise, the Lok Sabha Elections 2024 , WhatsApp’s Tipline has emerged as a crucial tool for combating the spread of deepfakes and misinformation. Created by the Misinformation Combat Alliance’s (MCA) Deepfakes Analysis Unit (DAU), the Tipline aims to raise public awareness and provide assistance in identifying AI-manipulated content.: Launched in March 2024, WhatsApp’s Tipline has quickly become a trusted resource for users seeking to verify the authenticity of images and videos. Since its inception, the Tipline has received hundreds of messages from users asking for help in distinguishing real from fake content.: The Tipline is accessible in multiple languages, including Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, and English, making it widely usable across India’s diverse linguistic landscape.Users can flag suspected deepfake content by sending audio notes or videos to the Tipline. The process is listed below:Most of the manipulated content received involves doctored videos where the original audio is altered using AI to make a person appear to say something they did not. These videos often feature prominent figures such as actors, businessmen, politicians, and TV anchors. Additionally, AI-created memes of politicians using face-blending techniques or other less sophisticated methods have been commonly reported.WhatsApp’s Tipline uses advanced generative AI to analyze and detect deepfakes. This involves reconstructing the mouth movements of subjects to sync with altered audio, making the deepfakes appear more convincing.Pamposh Raina, Head of the DAU, emphasized the collaborative nature of the DAU’s approach. By partnering with detection and forensic experts, the DAU supports its fact-checking partners who play a critical role in this project. Raina stated, “The strength of the DAU lies in the collaborative model which it is building by partnering with detection and forensic experts. Our goal is to drive public awareness on the issue of algorithm-based fabrication, and I am confident that this symbiotic model can be replicated globally to combat misinformation spread through audio and video content produced using generative AI.”The successful implementation of WhatsApp’s Tipline during the Lok Sabha elections 2024 highlights the potential of such tools in combating misinformation. As deepfake technology continues to evolve, the need for robust detection and public awareness mechanisms becomes increasingly critical. WhatsApp’s initiative sets a precedent for similar efforts worldwide, showcasing how technology and collaboration can effectively address the challenges posed by AI-generated misinformation.",WhatsApp’s Tipline uses advanced generative AI to analyze and detect deepfakes.

Airtel’s $100-billion market cap is testimony to today’s India

A meeting with PM Narendra Modi in September of the year 2018 proved to be a turning point for Airtel, according to Bharti Airtel chairman Sunil Bharti Mittal. In an exclusive interview to Economic Times, Mittal spoke about a range of things including his meeting with PM Modi, Airtel's journey to $100 billion market capitalisation and more.Mittal recalled Reliance Jio's entry in the year 2016 and how it turned the industry upside down. ""September 2016 was the Jio launch and 2018 was the time when I think the industry was in the most distress… Ebitda had crashed due to the free services. We had to keep going down (in terms of tariffs). Then the first losses started at that time after many years and debt was pretty high. So the company was shaky. And in March 2018, I still recall that you could sense a concern among the rank and file of the company. You could see it on the faces of professionals working at Airtel. Company after company was folding up — Tatas selling to us, three companies going into NCLT. And that was the time that the regulatory hits started to bother me. Regulations, which were coming one after the other, were disturbing,"" said.""And then in 2018, I sought a meeting with the PM,"" he went on to add. ""I was still the chairman of GSMA… just coming out from the chairmanship of the International Chamber of Commerce, when I used to brief him (PM) occasionally on WTO, G20 and other issues. So, I took his permission to talk about the Indian telecom industry. I told him that things were very bad and the situation was getting very alarming. I said I will fight in the marketplace, but I can’t fight the government… we spoke in Hindi. He told me that this government will not tilt towards either side. Whatever is good for the country will be done. You fight in the marketplace... I don’t have a view on that. But you can be sure that the government will not take sides,"" Mittal said.He went on to add how the PM's words kind of assured him. That was enough for me. I got up and I thanked him, and said, “I will fight in the market”. This was the turning point.""Talking about Airtel's $100 billion market cap milestone, Mittal said, ""This $100-billion market cap is a testimony to what India is today, not just my company. Money is pouring into this country, a lot of capital is coming in, investments are coming in, the stock market is rising. These massive valuations are a function of a stable, solid, functional economy under a very solid leader.""","Bharti Airtel chairman Sunil Bharti Mittal spoke about his meeting with PM Narendra Modi.
