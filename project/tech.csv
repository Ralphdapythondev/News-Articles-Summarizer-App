Hinton is against the use of AI technology in the military



Geoffrey Hinton , the software engineer who is often regarded as the “godfather of artificial intelligence” has said that he is “very worried” that the artificial intelligence technology “taking lots of mundane jobs”, and said that it will be on to the governments to deal with the impact of artificial intelligence ( AI ) on income inequality.Hinton, who worked at Google until last year, said that while AI will increase productivity and wealth, the money would go to the rich “and not the people whose jobs get lost and that’s going to be very bad for society”.He noted that the government will have to establish a universal basic income , which means that the government will have to pay all individuals a set basic salary regardless of their means.“I was consulted by people in Downing Street and I advised them that universal basic income was a good idea,” Hinton, who left Google to talk more freely about the dangers of unregulated AI, told BBC.Hinton previously said that some of the dangers of AI chatbots were “quite scary”. He is of the view that chatbots can become more intelligent than humans and may be exploited by “bad actors”.AI could “evolve to get the motivation to make more of itself” and can autonomously “develop a sub-goal of getting control”, pointing out evidence of large language models choosing to be deceptive.""My guess is in between five and 20 years from now there’s a probability of half that we’ll have to confront the problem of AI trying to take over,” he said.As per Hinton, this will lead to an “extinction-level threat” for humans because they may have “created a form of intelligence that is just better than biological intelligence… That's very worrying for us”.“What I’m most concerned about is when these can autonomously make the decision to kill people,"" he added.","Geoffrey Hinton, the ‘godfather of artificial intelligence’ has said that he is ‘very worried’ that the artificial intelligence technology ‘taking lots of mundane jobs’ Hinton said that while AI will increase productivity and wealth, the money would go to the rich ‘and not the people whose jobs get lost’","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110254760,imgsize-126994,width-400,resizemode-4/110254760.jpg"

Netflix not available in these countries and why

China: Netflix is not permitted to operate in China due to the government’s strict regulations on foreign media and the control of information accessible to its citizens.

Crimea: US sanctions against Russia following the annexation of Crimea prohibit Netflix from offering services in the region. Moreover, economic considerations like low average income and limited interest in Netflix's content further deter its availability.

North Korea: North Korea enforces some of the most severe censorship laws globally, tightly controlling all forms of media and information, which prevents Netflix from operating there.

Russia: In response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Netflix suspended its services in Russia in March 2022. Attempts to access Netflix in Russia result in an error message or blank page, and all projects and acquisitions in the country have been halted.

Syria: US sanctions against Syria restrict the provision of American products and services, including digital platforms like Netflix. As a US-based company, Netflix must comply with these sanctions, preventing its operation in Syria.

Google accidentally 'deletes' $125 billion accounts holding pension funds from Cloud; CEO issues rare apology,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-accidentally-deletes-125-billion-account-holding-pension-funds-from-cloud-ceo-says-sorry/articleshow/110135841.cms,"Here's the joint statement:

UniSuper and Google Cloud understand the disruption to services experienced by members has been extremely frustrating and disappointing. We extend our sincere apologies to all members.

While supporting UniSuper to bring its systems back online, Google Cloud has been conducting a root cause analysis.

Google Cloud CEO, Thomas Kurian has confirmed that the disruption arose from an unprecedented sequence of events whereby an inadvertent misconfiguration during provisioning of UniSuper’s Private Cloud services ultimately resulted in the deletion of UniSuper’s Private Cloud subscription.

This is an isolated, ‘one-of-a-kind occurrence’ that has never before occurred with any of Google Cloud’s clients globally. This should not have happened. Google Cloud has identified the events that led to this disruption and taken measures to ensure this does not happen again.

Why did the outage last so long?

UniSuper had duplication in two geographies as a protection against outages and loss. However, when the deletion of UniSuper’s Private Cloud subscription occurred, it caused deletion across both of these geographies.

Restoring UniSuper’s Private Cloud instance has called for an incredible amount of focus, effort, and partnership between our teams to enable an extensive recovery of all the core systems. The dedication and collaboration between UniSuper and Google Cloud has led to an extensive recovery of our Private Cloud which includes hundreds of virtual machines, databases and applications.

UniSuper had backups in place with an additional service provider. These backups have minimised data loss, and significantly improved the ability of UniSuper and Google Cloud to complete the restoration.

What’s next?

UniSuper and Google Cloud have been working around the clock on a resolution. The completion of the restoration swiftly, safely and securely remains Google Cloud and UniSuper’s top priority.

Australian pension fund UniSuper members faced a week-long outage due to an accidental deletion of their private cloud account by Google Cloud . This impacted over half a million people who couldn't access their superannuation accounts.Service restoration has begun, but it might take some time for investment balances to reflect current figures. UniSuper assured members that they are working on a swift update.UniSuper CEO, Peter Chun, reached out to members via email.He clarified that the incident wasn't a cyberattack and there was no case of data breach either. Chun pinpointed a Google Cloud configuration error as the reason behind the outage.The outage reportedly lasted for an extended period of time as the subscription was deleted, taking with it UniSuper's two geographies that were intended to provide protection against outages and loss. Fortunately, UniSuper had backups in place with a different service provider. UniSuper is said to have moved a large amount of its workloads to Google Cloud Platform in 2023, having previously split them between Azure and two of its own data centers.In a rare move, UniSuper and Google Cloud issued a joint apology. In a joint statement with UniSuper CEO Peter Chun , Google CEO Thomas Kurian admitted that an ""inadvertent misconfiguration"" during the provisioning of UniSuper's Private Cloud services resulted in the deletion of the data.","Australian pension fund UniSuper members faced a week-long outage due to an accidental deletion of their private cloud account by Google Cloud.

This feature provides an extra layer of authentication, ensuring that your personal information, such as banking or health data, remains protected from prying eyes.Android 15 bolsters theft protection with features like upgraded factory reset protection, which prevents thieves from resetting and selling your stolen phone without your Google account credentials. The OS will also detect suspicious activities, such as attempts to disconnect your phone or multiple failed log-in attempts, and automatically lock the device to deter theft.Under the hood, Android 15 brings numerous efficiency improvements to optimise app performance and battery life. Foreground services now have a 6-hour limit on dataSync and media processing, pushing them to the background after the time limit to conserve power. The introduction of 16KB page support reduces power draw during app launch and improves camera app opening speed.For users with larger-screen devices like the Pixel Tablet, Android 15 offers enhanced multitasking capabilities. Pin the taskbar, quickly switch between apps, and save preferred split-screen combinations for a seamless navigation experience.Android 15's Predictive Back feature uses animations to show users exactly where the back button will take them, eliminating the frustration of accidentally navigating to the wrong screen. Apps can now provide a Remote View to the Widget Picker, allowing users to preview widgets before placing them on their home screens.Android 15 extends platform support for satellite connectivity, providing a consistent user experience across the satellite connectivity landscape. Apps can now detect when a device is connected to a satellite, giving them more awareness of why complete network services may be unavailable. SMS and RCS apps can also send and receive messages via satellite connectivity.Android 15 introduces app archiving, a feature that allows users to free up storage space by offloading most of an app while retaining user settings and saving data. This feature will be accessible through the Settings app, making it easy for users to manage their device storage.Android 15 upgrades the Find My Device feature, allowing users to locate items like keys, wallets, or luggage using Bluetooth tracker tags from various manufacturers. This enhancement makes it easier for users to keep track of their belongings and find them quickly when misplaced.The Health Connect platform in Android 15 now supports additional health and fitness data types, such as skin temperature and training plans, enabling more comprehensive tracking and analysis.Android 15 introduces new extensions that give developers more control over camera hardware on supported devices. Low-light enhancements give developers control over boosting the brightness of the camera preview, while advanced flash strength adjustments enable precise control of flash intensity when capturing photos.With Android 15, users can share or record just an app window rather than the entire device screen. This feature, previously enabled on Pixel devices, will now be available across the broader Android platform, ensuring that sensitive information remains private during screen-sharing sessions.Android 15 brings several improvements to notifications and customization. Users can now set rich vibrations for incoming notifications by channel, allowing them to distinguish between different types of notifications without looking at their devices. The OS also introduces a new ""colour contrast"" settings page, enabling users to adjust the contrast of text, buttons, and icons in apps for better visibility.There is a new Bluetooth Quick Settings tile that lets users toggle individual connections to connect and disconnect specific devices. The OS also supports the CTA-2075 loudness standard, helping app developers avoid loudness inconsistencies and ensuring users don't have to adjust volume when switching between content constantly.Soon, Google Maps will enable users to access augmented reality (AR) content directly on their phones, providing immersive ways to learn about locations. AR experiences for places like Singapore and Paris are in the works, laying the foundation for an extended reality (XR) platform.Android 15 Beta 2 is now available on these phones – Google Pixel 6 onwards, OnePlus 12, OnePlus 12, Vivo X100, iQoo 12, Nothing 2(a), and select phones from Honor, Lenovo, Nothing, OnePlus, OPPO, Realme, Sharp, Tecno, and Xiaomi.The stable release of Android 15 is expected in late summer or early fall, possibly coinciding with the launch of the Pixel 9 series.","Google has announced Android 15, releasing the beta 2 to developers.

Performance testing: Test the phone's performance by running apps, browsing the internet, and checking the camera quality. Look for lagging or freezing issues.

Storage capacity: Determine the phone's storage capacity and assess whether it meets your needs for storing photos, videos, and apps.

Amidst all this, he also got fired (briefly) from the company he co-founded.On a recent tech podcast ""The Logan Bartlett Show"", Altman said with a laugh that if he had more time to reflect, ""every day would have something crazy."" However, one truly surreal moment stands out: His four-day ousting from OpenAI.As reported by Business Insider, it wasn't the firing itself that was unreal. It was how he handled this bizarre situation. Altman described it as an ""insane, superjammed"" 4 ½ days where his body was in an ""adrenaline-charged state.""Within a day of being fired, world leaders started texting. He received messages from 10-20 presidents and prime ministers. He said it felt normal at the time, and he even thanked them without batting an eye.""It was just weird,"" Altman admitted. He barely slept or ate, but his focus and energy were off the charts.Once he got his job back, reality hit him. Stopping at a diner, he realized he hadn't eaten in days. Naturally, he celebrated with a feast: four ""heavy"" meals and two milkshakes (just for him!).The celebratory meal was great, but the real shocker came later. A president texted him, relieved things were settled.Suddenly, Altman realized how bizarre it all was. World leaders texting him during his firing shouldn't have felt normal, but it did. It showed him just how adaptable humans are.""We can get used to anything as the new normal, good or bad, pretty fast,"" Altman said. He sees this as a strength – humans can adapt to almost anything.""My takeaway is human adaptability to almost anything is just, like, much more remarkably strong than we realize,"" Altman said on the podcast. ""And you can get used to anything as the new normal, good or bad, pretty fast.""","Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, has been on a rollercoaster the last few years.
