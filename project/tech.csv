Former Amazon VP: CEO of startup I worked with got me divorced,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/former-amazon-vp-ceo-of-startup-i-worked-with-got-me-divorced/articleshow/112792027.cms,"Read the complete post here

A CEO that I worked for seduced my wife in direct retaliation for my pushback on him at work. He won. I got divorced and left the company. When I say I truly understand how some executive teams can be political snake pits, I trust you will believe me. Learn from my pain - do the following:

1) When you have a good manager, lean in and take advantage of it.

2) Spot the snakes.

3) Do excellent work, even for nasty leaders.

4) Don’t confront the snakes directly

5) Don’t become a snake

1) When you have a good manager, lean in and take advantage of it.

While I “survived” bad bosses, most of my career progress came while working for good, honest, and helpful managers.

Hold on to these managers as much as you can. Help them grow and succeed so that you can stay together, and you can grow and succeed with them. See success as a partnership with the people you can trust.

Ultimately, the key to my career success was excelling when I had good managers and just surviving in the periods when I did not.

Also, notice I say take advantage of “it”, not “them”. Take advantage of and benefit from having a good manager.

Don’t become dishonest and take advantage of someone else for your benefit.

I recognized early on that my CEO in the divorce story was unethical and dishonest. My mistake was letting fear of a tough economy convince me to try to stay in the job and ""win"" by pushing back. It cost me far more than I ever thought it could.

Action: Do whatever you need to get to a good manager! Leave before the snake bites.

2) Spot the snakes.

Generally, it doesn’t take long to figure out who is a good person and who is only looking out for themselves.

There are so many ways to see through the dishonest people:

– See if their actions match their words

–Talk to others who have been there longer - they know!

– Investigate their pasts - talk to someone who used to work for them but is now safely away

A smooth talker may fool you in person, particularly if you give people the benefit of the doubt. Observing carefully and doing your research can help you not fall for the charm of someone you shouldn’t trust.

Being cautious is important, but there is a big difference between being watchful and skeptical and being cynical and untrusting. Extend some trust in case your leader is a good person, but do not make yourself fully vulnerable until you know.

With the CEO I talk about, I had ""spotted the snake"" - my mistake was staying too long and getting bitten.

3), 4), and 5)

I'm out of room here. To read about why you need to do excellent work for nasty execs, why you shouldn't confront them, and about not becoming a snake yourself, subscribe to our newsletter.

Readers- What is the most stunning display of unethical leadership you have seen from the “snake pit?”

A former Amazon vice president has claimed that a CEO he worked for seduced his wife, leading to the eventual breakdown of his marriage. In a lengthy post, Ethan Evans , a former Amazon vice president, shared his encounters with ""unethical leaders."" He described a particularly shocking incident where a CEO of a startup he worked with seduced his wife.""A CEO that I worked for seduced my wife in direct retaliation for my pushback on him at work. He won. I got divorced and left the company. When I say I truly understand how some executive teams can be political snake pits, I trust you will believe me,"" he said in the LinkedIn post.Evans emphasised the importance of honesty and integrity in the workplace, warning against dishonest behaviour for personal gain. ""Don’t become dishonest and take advantage of someone else for your benefit,"" he said.He also mentioned that that he recognised early on that his CEO in the divorce story was unethical and dishonest. However, his fear of economic hardship led him to stay in the job and try to ""win"" by pushing back. This ultimately cost him far more than he anticipated. He advised others to prioritise finding a good manager and to leave a toxic work environment before it causes irreparable harm.","A former Amazon vice president has claimed that a CEO he worked for seduced his wife, leading to the eventual breakdown of his marriage.

Chinese companies using Amazon and other cloud for Nvidia’s high-end AI chips: How it may not be US rules' violation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/chinese-companies-using-amazon-and-other-cloud-for-nvidias-high-end-ai-chips-how-it-may-not-be-us-rules-violation/articleshow/112786268.cms,"AWS denies wrongdoing

How this is not a US rule violation

Chinese companies linked to the government are reportedly employing cloud services offered by Amazon and other providers to access advanced US AI chips and capabilities, despite US export restrictions , which aim to curb the Chinese military's technological advancements.As per an investigation by news agency Reuters, at least 11 Chinese companies have been found seeking restricted US technologies via cloud platforms, with some explicitly naming Amazon Web Services (AWS).Shenzhen University spent 200,000 yuan ($27,996) on an AWS account to gain access to cloud servers powered by Nvidia A100 and H100 chips for an unspecified project, according to a March tender document. It got this service via an intermediary, Yunda Technology Ltd Co, the document showed, as per Reuters.Meanwhile AWS has denied flouting US rules.“AWS complies with all applicable US laws, including trade laws, regarding the provision of AWS services inside and outside of China,” a spokesperson for Amazon's cloud business was quoted as saying.Amazon has been found to be providing Chinese organisations access to not only advanced AI chips but also sophisticated AI models like Anthropic's Claude, which they wouldn't be able to access otherwise.Chu Ruisong, the President of AWS Greater China, publicly stated at a conference in Shanghai that their cloud platform, Bedrock, offers access to leading LLMs, including closed-source models like Claude 3.""Bedrock provides a selection of leading LLMs including prominent closed-source models such as Anthropic's Claude 3,"" Ruisong said at a generative AI-themed conference in Shanghai in May, referring to its cloud platform.Providing access to such chips or advanced AI models through the cloud, however, is not a violation of US regulations since only exports or transfers of a commodity, software or technology are regulated.The US government is actively working to close this loophole, with proposed legislation and regulations aiming to regulate remote access to US technology and require cloud service providers to verify and report users of large AI models.“This loophole has been a concern of mine for years, and we are long overdue to address it,” said Michael McCaul, chair of the US House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee.Previously, it has been reported that Chinese companies have been using Microsoft cloud to access LLM models developed by ChatGPT creator OpenAI.","At least 11 Chinese companies have been found seeking restricted US technologies via cloud platforms, with some explicitly naming Amazon Web Services (AWS) Shenzhen University spent 200,000 yuan ($27,996) on an AWS account to gain access to cloud servers powered by Nvidia A100 and H100 chips.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112786249,imgsize-90920,width-400,resizemode-4/112786249.jpg"
"Why TRAI's ‘September 1 deadline’ for Airtel, Reliance Jio and Vodafone-Idea is ‘bad news’ for your OTPs",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-trais-september-1-deadline-for-airtel-reliance-jio-and-vodafone-idea-is-bad-news-for-your-otps/articleshow/112787423.cms,"What is the big change

What is Whitelisting or URLs

Similar disruption in 2021

Starting September 1, consumers might experience disruptions in receiving service and transactional messages from banks, financial institutions, and e-commerce firms on their mobile phones. This follows a directive from the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) aimed at reducing spam, particularly phishing attempts.Trai has instructed telecom companies to stop transmitting messages containing URLs, OTT links, APKs (Android application packages), or call-back numbers that are not whitelisted—registered with telcos—by senders from September 1.This directive means that banks, financial institutions, and online platforms must register their message templates and content with operators by August 31. If they fail to do so, messages containing these elements will be blocked.Currently, entities register their headers and templates with telcos but not the content of messages. This means operators do not check the content of transmitted messages. However, starting next month, telcos must create a mechanism to read the content of commercial messages and block those that do not match their records, according to experts.In India, 1.5-1.7 billion commercial messages are sent daily, totaling about 55 billion every month, according to industry data.Airtel, Reliance Jio and Vodafone-Idea want extension in deadlineAccording to a report in Economic Times, industry executives say the telecom sector is seeking more time from Trai to implement the mandate as the blockchain-based distributed ledger technology (DLT) platform needs updating. However, the regulator believes it has given sufficient time to the telcos and is unwilling to extend the deadline, according to officials familiar with the matter.Bharti Airtel, Reliance Jio, and Vodafone Idea did not respond to ET’s queries.Whitelisting requires entities sending messages to provide all information related to URLs, call-back numbers, etc., to telcos, who will then feed the information into their DLT platform. If the information matches, the message is passed; otherwise, it is blocked.For example, most transactional messages from banks, such as funds debit or credit, contain a call-back number. Transmission of such messages will be stopped if a bank does not whitelist the number.“Only those entities, including banks, which whitelist their URLs or content of the messages with telcos, will pass through; the rest will be blocked,” said a telecom industry executive.Mobile consumers faced a similar outage in March 2021 when the DLT platform was implemented, and telcos started scrubbing messages. At that time, there was widespread disruption as telcos blocked all commercial messages that did not contain whitelisted headers and templates. Following the disruption, all entities have since registered their headers and templates with telcos.Experts say that in the current scenario, an increasing number of messages may shift to over-the-top (OTT) platforms like WhatsApp and Google’s rich communication services (RCS) messaging, as there is no such mandate from Trai to govern them. However, banking messages, where rules do not permit transmission over OTT, will be blocked if the entities have not been whitelisted, the experts added.","Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) has instructed telecom companies to stop transmitting messages containing URLs, OTT links, APKs, or call-back numbers that are not whitelisted by senders.

Why Durov left Russia in 2014

Telegram's 'controversial role' in the Ukraine war

Elon Musk comes in support of Pavel

Telegram chief executive Pavel Durov was arrested at a Paris airport for offences related to his popular messaging app. Durov was detained at Le Bourget airport in Paris after arriving on a private jet. Telegram is an encrypted messaging app, ranked as one of the major social media platforms after Facebook, YouTube, WhatsApp, Instagram , TikTok and WeChat.Durov is accused of failing to take action to curb the criminal use of his platform. He faces investigation for allegedly allowing a wide range of crimes due to a lack of moderators on Telegram and lack of cooperation with police. A cybersecurity gendarmerie unit and France 's national anti-fraud police unit are leading the investigation.Encrypted messaging app Telegram allows groups of up to 200,000 members, which has led to accusations that it makes it easier for false information to spread virally. There are also accusations that the app is used to disseminate neo-Nazi, paedophilic, conspiratorial and terrorist content. Telegram has committed to never disclosing information about its users.The 39-year-old technology billionaire Pavel Durov holds dual French and UAE citizenship and has been vocal about keeping Telegram a neutral platform. According to Russian and French media, Durov became a French citizen in 2021. Durov is estimated by Forbes to have a fortune of $15.5 billion. Telegram was created by Durov and his brother Nikolai, a programmer and mathematician. The app is said to have around 900 million active users. Durov has also accused the FBI of seeking a backdoor into Telegram.Durov reportedly left Russia in 2014 after refusing to comply with demands to shut down opposition communities on his VK social media platform. Durov, however, has not said whether he renounced his Russian citizenship.Telegram app is particularly influential in Russia, Ukraine and the republics of the former Soviet Union. Telegram has become a major source of unfiltered content from both sides of the Ukraine war. Ukrainian and Russian governments both use Telegram heavily. The platform has become what some analysts call 'a virtual battlefield' for the war, used heavily by Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and his officials, as well as the Russian government.Tesla CEO Elon Musk posted the hashtag #FreePavel on the X social media platform, formerly Twitter. He wrote in French, ""Liberte Liberte! Liberte?"" (Freedom Freedom! Freedom?). Spacex CEO also said that Facebook-owned Instagram has a massive child exploitation problem, but no arrest for its founder Mark Zuckerberg . He claimed the reason for the same is that he censors free speech and gives governments backdoor access to user data.",Telegram CEO Pavel Durov was arrested at Le Bourget airport in Paris.

Zomato recently purchased the events and movie ticketing arm of Paytm . In a letter to the shareholders, Zomato CEO Deepinder Goyal said that the company will soon bring a dedicated app for going-out. He stated that the acquisition gives an opportunity to “spin-off thebusiness into a new app (we are going to call it District) which could be a game changer for each of these use cases given the need for a single brand as a destination in this segment”.“Customers have to go to different apps for booking movie tickets, IPL tickets, dining-out table reservations, discovering live entertainment, booking weekend getaways, etc. Having all these use-cases addressed through ‘District’ - our dedicated going-out app - has the potential to drive strong customer engagement and incremental demand across each of these use cases,” he added.Stating that the food delivery platform wants to position District as the brand that consumers turn to when they are thinking of going out, Goyal also listed details of the upcoming app. He said “Post this acquisition, the going-out business would be spread across multiple different platforms -1) Zomato’s existing going-out business (dining-out + event ticketing) would continue to run on the Zomato app and2) the acquired business (movie + sports + event ticketing) would continue to run on the Paytm’s main app (for a transition period of up to 12 months) along with Insider and TicketNew apps (which would both get transferred to Zomato as part of the transaction).”He said that eventually Zomato will add a button to launch the District app on the Zomato app. Goyal said that the app will launch “anytime in the next few weeks.”","Zomato recently purchased the events and movie ticketing arm of Paytm.

Billionaire Elon Musk expressed his openness to a potential cabinet or advisory role following Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump ’s recent comments. Musk made this announcement via his 'X' platform in response to Trump’s remarks about considering him for a key position if Trump wins the upcoming US presidential election .In a Reuters interview, Donald Trump revealed that he is contemplating offering Elon Musk a position within his administration should he secure a victory in the 2024 election.Trump indicated that Musk, who serves as the CEO of both Tesla and SpaceX, could be considered for an advisory role or even a cabinet position, contingent on Musk’s willingness to accept such a role.During the same interview, Trump expressed his views on economic incentives, mentioning that he might consider eliminating the $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicle purchases. Trump argued that tax credits and incentives are not typically effective tools for economic improvement, reflecting his broader scepticism of such financial policies.Musk’s engagement with Trump’s campaign has been notably proactive. Following an assassination attempt on Trump in Pennsylvania, Musk publicly endorsed Trump’s candidacy and has been actively involved in his campaign. Musk’s support included a high-profile interview with Trump on the 'X' platform, which reportedly experienced a significant DDoS attack but garnered over a billion views.Musk’s endorsement has extended beyond public support; he has reportedly pledged $45 million per month to the America PAC, a political action committee supporting Trump’s campaign. The PAC’s primary focus is on enhancing voter outreach and registration efforts to strengthen Trump's position against the Democratic Party's campaigns.Under Musk’s ownership, Twitter (now 'X') reinstated Trump’s account, which had been permanently suspended following the January 6, 2021, Capitol Hill attack. This move aligns with Musk’s broader strategy to support Trump’s re-election bid, demonstrating his influence on social media platforms.As the 2024 presidential election approaches, the political landscape is taking shape. Vice President Kamala Harris has emerged as the Democratic candidate following Joe Biden’s withdrawal from the race on June 21 after a debate with Trump. The election, scheduled for November 5, will see Trump’s campaign bolstered by Musk’s financial and public support.This development highlights the evolving nature of political alliances and the significant role that influential figures like Elon Musk play in shaping electoral outcomes.

Tensor G4, Gemini and more AI inside

Upgraded cameras with the new 'Add me' AI feature for photos

Google has launched its second-generation Pixel foldable phone, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold , which is its first-ever foldable phone in India. The second-gen Pixel Fold upgrades on some salient aspects over the first one. Per Google, the foldable is slim, super durable, and has a brighter screen, both on the outside and inside. And, the phone also packs in Pixel’s “fastest, most powerful” Tensor G4 chip , bringing on-device multimodal capabilities to the phone.On the inside, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold comes equipped with an 8 inches ‘Super Actua Flex display,’ an LTPO panel with a 2922x1344 resolution at 486 PPI. The inner screen has a dynamic refresh rate of 1-120Hz and can go as bright as 3,000 nits, which Google says is 80% brighter than the screen on the first-gen Pixel Fold. To make use of phone’s large inner canvas, there’s a split-screen mode that’ll let you use two apps side-by-side.When unfolded, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold can be used a regular phone with a 6.3 inches outer screen, which has the same specs as the inner screen.Google says that the Pixel 9 Pro Fold has an “all-new” hinge that is made from stainless steel and has an aerospace grade aluminium alloy cover. The hinge has a polished finish, while the back has the silky matt finish. The phone is rated IPX8 for water resistivity. And there’s Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the outside.Powering the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is Google’s Tensor G4 chip, also found on the other three Pixel 9 phones. The chip comes paired with 16GB of RAM and up to 1TB storage. Then, there’s theTitan M2 security coprocessor , which enables multi-layer hardware security.There’s a 5,060mAh battery, which Google promises will last for over 24 hours and up to 100 hours with Extreme Battery Saver. The phone supports fast charging at 45W, which should fill up the battery up to 55% in about 30 minutes. FYI, the charger isn’t included in the box. The phone also supports Qi wireless charging and Battery Share, i.e., reverse wireless charging.Out-of-the-box the Pixel 9 Pro Fold will come with Android 14 . There’s the usual Google promise of 7 years of OS and security updates.Would it even be a Pixel phone, if there’s no AI in it. Well, there’s a whole lot of AI. For starters Gemini is there, and it works in split-screen mode, as well. One could ask Gemini to write stuff or even get info about whats’s on the screen or photos.

GM recently faced a few software incidents

General Motors is laying off more than 1,000 salaried employees globally in its software and services division, the company confirmed earlier this week. The job cuts , which include about 600 positions at GM's tech campus near Detroit, come as part of a review to streamline operations in the unit.""As we build GM's future, we must simplify for speed and excellence, make bold choices, and prioritise the investments that will have the greatest impact,"" GM said in a statement to CNBC.The layoffs represent approximately 1.3% of GM's global salaried workforce of 76,000 as of the end of 2023. The cuts primarily affect the automaker's US operations. Impacted employees were notified Monday morning.""We are grateful to those who helped establish a strong foundation that positions GM to lead moving forward,"" the automaker added in its statement.""As a result, we're reducing certain teams within the Software and Services organisation,"" GM stated. The division, currently led by executives Baris Cetinok and Dave Richardson, covers areas such as vehicle infotainment, OnStar services, and GM's Super Cruise advanced driver-assist system.The change comes less than six months after leadership shifts in the unit, including the departure of former Apple executive Mike Abbott in March due to health reasons.The job cuts follow GM's efforts to reduce costs amid industry concerns of a potential downturn and significant investments in electric vehicles and software-defined vehicles. GM has recently faced challenges with software issues in its new Chevy Blazer EV, including blank infotainment screens and charging error messages. The company issued a stop sale notice last December due to these problems, which was lifted in March.The layoffs also come after GM cancelled its ""Ultra Cruise"" programme, a competitor to Tesla's Full Self-Driving system, in January. The company merged the FSD team with its regular Super Cruise team.Despite the layoffs and recent setbacks, the company says it continues to work on expanding its hands-free driving system, with plans to broaden its capabilities by the end of 2025.","GM is laying off more than 1,000 salaried employees globally in its software and services division.

“Hell, I might just launch at India just for the sake of it!”

How the YouTuber reacted to the troll’s comments



“Saar your mum after I do my shift at Uber screams that at night btw saar, please saar, harder saar, I spit on the b***h and all she says is thaank sou saar. I don't shower saar and women don't talk to me saar. I work at Tim Hortons saar.”

“Believe it or not, I just don't like India. Also I can sense an Indian, he is Indian. If a man online suddenly talks about ducking your mother in the first response, he's Indian. Many such cases.”

A UK-based YouTuber named Miles Routledge has faced backlash after he made several racist remarks targeting Indians on the social media platform X (earlier known as Twitter). It all started with a meme video that he uploaded on X as a joke. The video showed alleged nuclear missiles coming out of hidden silos in the US and a worldwide nuclear war.While sharing the video he wrote: “When I become prime minister of England, I'll open the nuclear silos as an explicit warning to any foreign power that interferes with British interests and affairs.I'm not talking huge incidents, I'm itching to launch and atomise entire nations over the smallest infraction.”A few minutes later Routledge added a comment to the post as he said:After sharing the post, he also responded to the comments made from a troll account which is now unavailable.“Saar I will see you soon saar,” Routledge said replying to the troll's commentsIn another reply, Routledge wrote:He also started receiving threatening DMs from the troll. Assuming that the trolling account may belong to an Indian, he started replying to the X profile with racist remarks against Indians. He shared a screenshot of DMs shared between him and the troll.“Indian threatens to find me, it backfires lmao,” he wrote captioning the screenshot. The image also included the YouTuber’s location and description of his clothes as he challenged the troll to come find him. Since then, the post has received more than 5 million views.In separate posts, he also shared his entire conversation as well as the profile details of the trolling account (which later became unavailable) on the platform.Here’s the full conversation between Routledge and the troll:Routledge’s remarks against Indians have drawn criticism.

In a surprising verdict, a Pune district court has dismissed a 13-year-old lawsuit filed by the American fast-food chain Burger King Corporation against a locally-owned eatery with the same name. The US company had accused the Pune-based Burger King of trademark infringement and sought a permanent injunction, damages, and a halt to the use of the name. The court dismissed the lawsuit filed by the Burger King Corporation in 2011, seeking a permanent injunction restraining infringement of trademark.However, the court ruled in favor of the local eatery, stating that it had been operating under the name ""Burger King"" since 1991-92, well before the US chain entered the Indian market.The plaintiff's first Indian BURGER KING restaurant was opened in New Delhi on November 9, 2014, the court said.The court found no evidence to support Burger King Corporation's claim that customers were confused or misled by the local eatery's use of the name. Additionally, the company failed to prove any actual financial loss due to the alleged infringement. The court said the Burger King Corporation has ""miserably failed"" to prove that the eatery here had infringed its trademark Burger King while running the restaurant in Pune.Burger King filed the lawsuit against Anahita Irani and Shapoor Irani. The Iranis opposed the suit, saying it was filed with malafide intentions and to discourage business people who are bonafide users and retailers. They said that apart from the name Burger King, there was absolutely no similarity in the plaintiff's trademark and their own shop name.This decision may have implications for trademark disputes involving established local businesses and multinational corporations.The Pune-based restaurant owners had counterclaimed for damages due to the harassment they endured during the lengthy legal battle. They sought Rs 20 lakh as damages. The court, however, refused any monetary relief to them too, noting that apart from oral evidence, no other proof was submitted to substantiate their claims.","Pune court dismisses 13-year-old lawsuit filed by Burger King Corporation.
