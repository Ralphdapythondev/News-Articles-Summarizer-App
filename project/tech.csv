"US opposes proposed Canadian tech law that may make Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Meta and others lose millions",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/us-opposes-proposed-canadian-tech-law-that-may-make-apple-microsoft-google-amazon-meta-and-others-lose-millions/articleshow/112975326.cms,"Why Canada is trying to impose these tech rules



What US government said against Canada’s tech law



“The US opposes unilateral digital service taxes that discriminate against US companies. As we pursue these consultations, we will continue to support the Department of the Treasury in the OECD/G20 global tax negotiations to bring a comprehensive solution to the challenge of DSTs.""

The Digital Services Tax (DST) proposed by the Justin Trudeau-led Canada may have major financial implications on US-based tech giants like Apple , Google, Microsoft and others. The US government has objected to the proposed tax and has asked Canada to delay passing the law. The country argued the Canadian DST unfairly targets US-based tech companies as most of the major players in the industry are based in the US.According to a report by AppleInsider, nearly all of the biggest global tech players including Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta among others will be impacted by the proposed Canadian law.In 2021, Canada first proposed its latest tech rules after G20 countries agreed on allowing for international digital service tax (DST) reform. The G20 countries has since been working together to create a multilateral tax on profits made by global tech companies through services.Canada, along with other countries, has since been planning to implement taxes on profits that tech companies generate from online marketplace services, advertising, social media services, and revenue from selling user data.Under the proposed Canadian law, tech companies that would qualify for these taxes if they earn $750 million or more in annual qualifying revenue, with at least $20 million coming directly from Canadian users.As per the report, the Biden administration has indicated that the proposed interim tax structure may violate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) rules and has requested trade dispute settlement consultations with Canada.If US Trade Representative Katherine Tai fails to reach an agreement addressing the country’s concerns within 75 days of the consultations, she may request the formation of a settlement panel under the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), the report added. This dispute could potentially result in retaliatory US tariffs on Canadian imports.Earlier, the US prepared tariffs against seven countries that have implemented digital service tax legislation including Austria, Britain, France, India, Italy, Spain and Turkey. However, these tariffs have been put on hold while global negotiations for a comprehensive digital service tax (DST) agreement continue.In a statement to AppleInsider, Tai said:If Canada's DST passes, this new legislation could take effect later this year, and amounts owed by tech companies would be backdated to January 1, 2022. The Canadian legislation may also be negotiating tactic to nudge the global G20 tax reform proposals concerning digital services, the report notes.",Digital Services Tax (DST) proposed by the Justin Trudeau-led Canada may have major financial implications on US-based tech giants.

“$ is not just a currency symbol. It is embedded in many programming language syntaxes such as:

- We write variables under this ${} in javascript.

- Variables are also written like this $1, $2 in bash syntax.”

“The '$' is also an important character in programming languages, such as Perl,”

“Only a person who works on MS Excel knows the answer. $ is used to freeze a Row or column in Excel formulas and ₹ can't do that. That's why $ is used universally for that purpose . However, you can anytime use ₹ on your computer.”

“Bhavish, I recommend you ask the software engineers in your company rather than Twitter! :),”

"Why TRAI's ‘September 1 deadline’ for Airtel, Reliance Jio and Vodafone-Idea is ‘bad news’ for your OTPs",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-trais-september-1-deadline-for-airtel-reliance-jio-and-vodafone-idea-is-bad-news-for-your-otps/articleshow/112787423.cms,"What is the big change

What is Whitelisting or URLs

Similar disruption in 2021

Starting September 1, consumers might experience disruptions in receiving service and transactional messages from banks, financial institutions, and e-commerce firms on their mobile phones. This follows a directive from the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) aimed at reducing spam, particularly phishing attempts.Trai has instructed telecom companies to stop transmitting messages containing URLs, OTT links, APKs (Android application packages), or call-back numbers that are not whitelisted—registered with telcos—by senders from September 1.This directive means that banks, financial institutions, and online platforms must register their message templates and content with operators by August 31. If they fail to do so, messages containing these elements will be blocked.Currently, entities register their headers and templates with telcos but not the content of messages. This means operators do not check the content of transmitted messages. However, starting next month, telcos must create a mechanism to read the content of commercial messages and block those that do not match their records, according to experts.In India, 1.5-1.7 billion commercial messages are sent daily, totaling about 55 billion every month, according to industry data.Airtel, Reliance Jio and Vodafone-Idea want extension in deadlineAccording to a report in Economic Times, industry executives say the telecom sector is seeking more time from Trai to implement the mandate as the blockchain-based distributed ledger technology (DLT) platform needs updating. However, the regulator believes it has given sufficient time to the telcos and is unwilling to extend the deadline, according to officials familiar with the matter.Bharti Airtel, Reliance Jio, and Vodafone Idea did not respond to ET’s queries.Whitelisting requires entities sending messages to provide all information related to URLs, call-back numbers, etc., to telcos, who will then feed the information into their DLT platform. If the information matches, the message is passed; otherwise, it is blocked.For example, most transactional messages from banks, such as funds debit or credit, contain a call-back number. Transmission of such messages will be stopped if a bank does not whitelist the number.“Only those entities, including banks, which whitelist their URLs or content of the messages with telcos, will pass through; the rest will be blocked,” said a telecom industry executive.Mobile consumers faced a similar outage in March 2021 when the DLT platform was implemented, and telcos started scrubbing messages. At that time, there was widespread disruption as telcos blocked all commercial messages that did not contain whitelisted headers and templates. Following the disruption, all entities have since registered their headers and templates with telcos.Experts say that in the current scenario, an increasing number of messages may shift to over-the-top (OTT) platforms like WhatsApp and Google’s rich communication services (RCS) messaging, as there is no such mandate from Trai to govern them. However, banking messages, where rules do not permit transmission over OTT, will be blocked if the entities have not been whitelisted, the experts added.","Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) has instructed telecom companies to stop transmitting messages containing URLs, OTT links, APKs, or call-back numbers that are not whitelisted by senders. This directive means that banks, financial institutions, and online platforms must register their message templates and content with operators by August 31.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112787424,imgsize-22212,width-400,resizemode-4/112787424.jpg"
