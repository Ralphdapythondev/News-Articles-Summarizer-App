Key features of Nagastra-1 include

In a significant boost to India's self-reliance in defense technology, the Indian Army has inducted the Nagastra-1 Loiter Munition, the country's first indigenous suicide drone. Developed by Nagpur-based Solar Industries, the Nagastra-1 is a man-portable weaponized drone system designed to neutralize enemy threats with high precision.The induction of Nagastra-1 marks a critical step towards India's self-sufficiency in drone technology for military applications. It is said to mark first step in a journey towards enhancing India's indigenous capabilities in utilizing drones and UAVs as crucial components of warfare machinery.For those unaware, Loiter Munition or suicide drones , are single-use weapons that fly into their targets and detonate on impact, they are capable of circling above a target and waiting for the perfect moment to strike. They are typically designed to loiter around a target area until a target is located, then attack the target by crashing into it.The advent of drone technology has proven to be a force multiplier in military operations globally, as evidenced by its successful application in recent conflicts worldwide, including the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict, strikes on oil fields in Saudi Arabia and the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict.High Accuracy: The drone boasts a ""kamikaze mode"" with GPS-enabled targeting for precise strikes, delivering an accuracy of within 2 meters.Endurance and Range: This lightweight (9 kg) electric drone offers an impressive 30-minute flight time. It can be operated manually for up to 15 kilometers or flown autonomously for up to 30 kilometers.Covert Operation: The electric propulsion system ensures quiet operation, making it difficult for enemies to detect the drone at altitudes exceeding 200 meters.Multi-functionality: Equipped with day and night surveillance cameras and a 1-kilogram warhead, the Nagastra-1 is effective against soft targets. It can also be aborted mid-mission and recovered using a parachute, enabling reuse – a key advantage over similar systems.Indigenous Development: Over 75% of the Nagastra-1's components are indigenously developed by a collaborative effort between Economics Explosives Ltd (EEL) and Z-Motion Autonomous Systems Pvt Ltd. The man-portable system (total weight 30 kg) comes in two rucksacks and includes a Ground Control Station, Communication Control unit, Payload compartment, and a Pneumatic Launcher.","The Indian Army has inducted the Nagastra-1 Loiter Munition, the country's first indigenous suicide drone.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai takes the witness stand in $600 million financial fraud case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-ceo-sundar-pichai-takes-the-witness-stand-in-600-million-financial-fraud-case/articleshow/111006118.cms,"What Sundar Pichai told the court

What led to Ozy Media's collapse

Google parent Alphabet Inc Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai reportedly took the witness stand at the fraud trial of Ozy Media Inc co-founder Carlos Watson . According to a report in Bloomberg, Pichai testified that the search giant never intended to buy the startup for any amount of money.At the fraud trial, Pichai denied any plans by Google to acquire the startup. Carlos Watson, Ozy Media’s co-founder, faces allegations of misleading investors about the company’s financial health and falsely claiming Google’s interest in buying Ozy.The scandal surfaced when it was revealed that Ozy’s COO Samir Rao impersonated a YouTube executive during a call with Goldman Sachs , leading to the company’s downfall. Rao has admitted guilt and implicated the scheme as an attempt to deceive investors about Ozy’s profitability.Pichai told the jury in Brooklyn, New York, federal court that an acquisition of Ozy was never discussed but that Google did consider hiring Watson as head of its news programming. A $25 million investment in Ozy would have been part of that deal.""Mr Watson was a critical part of Ozy Media, and we were considering making an investment in the company to make the transition easier,"" Pichai explained. But “did you ever offer to purchase Ozy Media for $600 million?” prosecutor Dylan Stern asked.“No,” replied Pichai. He said he had been introduced to Watson at a conference and then in a video interview for a possible Google job interacting with news outlets. Neither the hire nor the $25 million investment ultimately happened.This counters Watson’s assertions used to entice a $20 million investment from another party after a deal with Goldman Sachs collapsed. Pichai mentioned only meeting Watson twice, once briefly at a conference and again during a job interview, which did not result in employment.The once high-flying media startup, Ozy Media collapsed after the New York Times reported in 2021 that Chief Operating Officer Samir Rao impersonated YouTube executive Alex Piper on a call with Goldman Sachs Group Inc bankers.",Google CEO Sundar Pichai took the witness stand at the fraud trial of Ozy Media co-founder Carlos Watson.

What Amazon said about the AWS credits



Amazon has announced that it will be investing $230 million to help artificial intelligence (AI) startups. The e-commerce major confirmed that the investment will be done in the form of Amazon Web Service (AWS) credits. With this investment, the company wants to set an example for cloud providers who are trying to capture AI clients from nascent stages.According to a report by the news agency Reuters, these credits will offer early-stage generative AI startups free access to computing power, a variety of AI models, and infrastructure. However, to access Amazon’s services the startups need to build their companies on AWS.Additionally, these credits will also support 80 early-stage companies worldwide through the AWS Generative AI Accelerator program. Each startup admitted to the accelerator may receive up to $1 million in AWS credits .Apart from AWS, offering credits to startups is a common practice among cloud providers including Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud, These companies offer credits to attract enterprises to their services, as cloud costs can escalate significantly with increased usage.Amazon said that it already offers $1 billion in cloud credits every year to startups. With this new commitment, the company is focusing on supporting generativeAI startups as wellIn a statement to Reuters, Matt Wood, vice president of AI Products at AWS said: ""They'll be able to iterate very quickly and pivot very quickly as necessary. Then ultimately, when they hit on that home run, they'll be able to double down and get to the scale with security, responsibility and consistency.”Earlier this year, Amazon expanded its cloud credits to cover the use of models from providers such as Anthropic, Meta, Mistral AI, and Cohere.

"Government plans to work with TCS, HCL and other IT giants for quantum technology",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/government-plans-to-work-with-tcs-hcl-and-other-it-giants-for-quantum-technology/articleshow/111003041.cms,"What is National Quantum Mission

What is Quantum computing

The government is reportedly looking to work with IT giants like Tata Consultancy Services ( TCS ), HCL and Tech Mahindra to develop software for quantum technologies, under the National Quantum Mission (NQM) that was cleared to boost research in quantum technology in the country.“We are going to involve our software companies like TCS, HCL, Tech Mahindra etc., into this effort. We want them to do research on quantum technologies because there's a huge amount of algorithms required for quantum,” Moneycontrol quoted Ajai Chowdhry, co-founder of HCL and chairman of the mission governing board of the National Quantum Mission, as saying.In April last year, the cabinet gave an approval to the scheme with a total outlay of a bit more than Rs 6,000 crore for the period 2023-24 to 2030-31 to scale up research and development. It will also support Indian startups and scientists working in the emerging area to create an innovative ecosystem in quantum technology in India.Under the mission, the plan is to establish four research hubs focused on quantum hardware, encryption, sensors and materials. These hubs, expected to be operational by August 2024, will be located at premier research institutions like TIFR and IISc.“Our classical computer was based on a transistor system but quantum computing will be based on atoms. So, it is fast, authentic and has much more speed. This cabinet decision is going to give India a quantum jump in the field of quantum technology,” Union science and technology, space and atomic energy minister Jitendra Singh said at that time.“Normally, India has joined the elite clubs in different sectors after other countries had already excelled in those fields. But for the first time, we are entering this field when the first six countries — US, China, Canada, France, Austria and Finland — are also at the R&D stage,” Singh said.Quantum computing is used to solve problems – too complex for traditional computing – by tapping quantum physics.Quantum Computers are in early stages but are promising in fields like medicine, materials science and artificial intelligence as they can help us design new drugs, create lighter and stronger materials, or develop smarter AI.“Quantum technology will greatly benefit us in different sectors like communication, IT, pharmaceuticals, health, financial and energy sectors as well as drug design, space applications, and also give a boost to the government’s Aatmanirbhar Bharat,” Singh added.","The government is reportedly looking to work with IT giants like TCS, HCL and Tech Mahindra to develop software for quantum technologies.

Lawsuit comes a day after WSJ's report claiming 'sexual misconduct'

There may be some trouble for SpaceX CEO Elon Musk . Eight former SpaceX engineers have reportedly filed a lawsuit against Musk on Wednesday (June 12), accusing the CEO of sexual harassment and retaliation. The same group of fired employees are said to have also filed complaints with the US National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) about SpaceX’s alleged retaliation. Bloomberg first reported on the lawsuit. The eight employees reportedly include four women and four men. The complaint targets both Musk and SpaceX.“Musk knowingly and purposefully created an unwelcome hostile work environment based upon his conduct of interjecting into the workplace vile sexual photographs, memes, and commentary that demeaned women and/or the LGBTQ+ community,” the eight former employees wrote in the filing. “It was also common for engineers to apply crude and demeaning names to products in an attempt at humor, often at the expense of women and LGBTQ+ individuals. For example, the name ‘Upskirt Camera’ was used for a camera on the first stage of the Falcon rocket that views the bottom of the second stage,” the filing further adds.According to a Bloomberg report, the filing further claims that the former SpaceX engineers that Musk made the decision to fire them in retaliation for the open letter that they wrote in 2022, highlighting Musk's ""problematic behavior"". The complaint claims that when a SpaceX HR official suggested that the company conduct a formal investigation before taking any decisive action, Musk replied, “I don’t care — fire them.”The open letter against Elon Musk is said to have been shared in an internal SpaceX Microsoft Teams channel with more than 2,600 employees. “Elon’s behavior in the public sphere is a frequent source of distraction and embarrassment for us, particularly in recent weeks,” the letter stated. “As our CEO and most prominent spokesperson, Elon is seen as the face of SpaceX — every Tweet that Elon sends is a de facto public statement by the company. It is critical to make clear to our teams and to our potential talent pool that his messaging does not reflect our work, our mission, or our values,” it further added.SpaceX and Elon Musk did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the lawsuit. SpaceX has previously denied wrongdoing and said that the fired employees violated policies. It also said Musk was not involved in their terminations.The lawsuit comes just a day after the Wall Street Journal reported allegations that Musk made sexual advances to women at SpaceX, including a former intern he had sex with. SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell was quoted in the story accusing the Journal of presenting “untruths, mischaracterizations, and revisionist history,” and saying “Elon is one of the best humans I know.”",Eight former SpaceX engineers have reportedly filed a lawsuit against Elon Musk.

In the ever-evolving world of social media, Instagram has emerged as a marketplace teeming with opportunities and risks alike. Amid the plethora of legitimate businesses, scams have proliferated, targeting unsuspecting consumers with fraudulent schemes. One such incident has recently come to light, involving a USA-based businesswoman who fell victim to an elaborate jewellery scam on Instagram.A man who issued a fake certificate of registration for selling hallmarked gold to a city jeweller was arrested on Thursday. The jewellers, Gorav Soni and Rajendra Soni, are currently on the run. The accused, identified as Nand Kishore, was apprehended after interrogation revealed his role in the scam. This arrest followed a complaint from Charish Nortez, a businesswoman from the USA, who purchased jewellery worth approximately Rs 6 crore, only to discover she had been duped.Additional Deputy Commissioner of Police (North), Bajrang Singh Shekhawat, who is leading the investigation, disclosed that Nortez had been conducting business with Jaipur-based jewellers Gorav Soni and his father Rajendra Soni for many years. The duo allegedly sold her 9-carat gold jewellery instead of the promised 14-carat gold, and moissanite stones in place of diamonds, which are approximately 50 times cheaper.The fraud came to light when Nortez had the jewellery tested during an exhibition in the USA and discovered the deception. She then travelled to Jaipur to confront the jewellers, who in turn filed a case against her at Manak Chowk police station in March 2023. The USA embassy intervened, prompting an investigation under the direction of the Jaipur commissioner.During the investigation, the hallmark certificates were scrutinised to verify the authenticity of the gold and diamond purity. It was revealed that the certificates were fake, leading to the arrest of Nand Kishore, who had issued them.""The hallmark certificates were found to be not authentic, and the person who issued them was arrested,"" said Singh.The jewellers, Gorav Soni and Rajendra Soni, are currently absconding. In India, a hallmarking licence is mandatory for manufacturing and selling gold. However, the investigation uncovered that many jewellers are circumventing this requirement by procuring fake certificates from laboratories, thereby misleading customers.This case highlights the ongoing issue of fraudulent practices in the jewellery industry and underscores the importance of verifying the authenticity of hallmark certificates when purchasing gold and diamond jewellery. Authorities are continuing their efforts to track down the absconding jewellers and prevent further instances of such scams.As social media platforms continue to grow as marketplaces, consumers are urged to exercise caution and due diligence to avoid falling prey to similar fraudulent schemes.","A man who issued a fake certificate of registration for selling hallmarked gold to a city jeweller was arrested on Thursday.

How Apple is trying to regain its position in China



Apple has achieved a new milestone in iPhone sales. As per data from Stocklytics.com (seen by Patently Apple), the Cupertino-based tech giant has about to reach the $2 trillion mark in iPhone's lifetime sales. This achievement comes after a recent decline in market share due to competition from Chinese brands like Xiaomi and Huawei.Since its introduction in 2007, this has been Apple’s most successful product as the company keeps updating its smartphones with new models and features.As per Statista data, Apple grossed $78.7 billion from iPhone sales within five years after releasing the first mode. Two years later, in FY 2014, this figure jumped to $101.9 billion and continued rising.The tech giant experienced several challenging years, especially in 2019 and 2020 when consumers worldwide reduced their spending budgets amid the pandemic. The report alsoclaims that iPhone sales have doubled and hit record highs in 2022 and 2023.During those two years, Apple grossed over $405 billion from selling iPhones, the highest figures in its history. Despite the revenue figures dropping slightly in the second quarter of FY 2024, iPhone sales remain strong. Statistics show Apple grossed $115.6 billion from iPhone sales in H1 FY 2024, pushing its lifetime revenue to a whopping $1.95 trillion.In Q1 FY 2009, Apple’s iPhone sales also accounted for about a quarter of Apple’s total revenue. Since then, this figure has more than doubled and hit 50.64% in Q1 2024.China is one of the biggest iPhone markets for Apple. According to a report by Counterpoint, Apple’s iPhone sales declined by more than 19% as Huawei saw 70% year-on-year growth in its smartphone sales in the country.To increase iPhone sales in China, Apple reportedly launched an aggressive discounting campaign on its official Tmall website in China in May. With these discounts, the company aims to fight off growing competition from local brands like Huawei. The latest discounts were steeper than those offered earlier this year.","Apple grossed $115.6 billion from iPhone sales in H1 FY 2024, pushing its lifetime revenue to a whopping $1.95 trillion.

Countries where WhatsApp is banned

Why these countries have banned WhatsApp?

WhatsApp bans 80 lakh accounts in India in March 2024

Apple removed Meta ’s WhatsApp from its App Store in China last month. The company then complied with China’s internet regulator’s – Cyberspace Administration order. In April this year, WhatsApp filed a plea with the Delhi high court to challenge India's 2021 IT rules for social media intermediaries, ‘threatening’ to leave the country if asked to break end-to-end-encryption.However, it is not only China where WhatsApp faces restrictions. Despite over 2 billion users worldwide, the social media app is banned in many countries. Although there are some workarounds like using VPN and other tools to overcome these restrictions, but not everyone is willing to take this extra step.Coming back to the number of countries where WhatsApp is banned or faces restrictions, there are 6 in total. These are China, North Korea, Iran, Qatar, Syria and United Arab Emirates (UAE).China has barred the use of foreign messaging apps like WhatsApp for years due to the “Great Wall”' restrictions. This has resulted in other messaging platforms like WeChat and Weibo dominating the Chinese market. Similarly, North Korea, which has one of the most restrictive national policies, does not allow its citizens to use WhatsApp or any other major messaging app used globally.Other countries that have banned WhatsApp include Iran, Syria, Qatar and United Arab Emirates (UAE). Syria and Iran have banned WhatsApp to regulate the information flow in the war-torn country. The UAE, on the other hand, has blocked WhatsApp voice and video calls to promote local telecommunication companies. Qatar too has blocked WhatsApp calls, but allows its citizens to send text messages over the app.In another news, WhatsApp said that it has banned more than 7.9 million accounts in India between March 1 to March 31, 2024. Releasing its latest monthly report, the platform said that 1,430,000of these accounts were proactively banned, before any reports from users.The report was published under the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021.","Despite over 2 billion users worldwide, the social media app is banned in many countries.

During summer months, many households experience a significant increase in electricity consumption due to higher cooling needs. While staying comfortable during hot weather is essential, it doesn't have to come at the cost of soaring electricity bills. By implementing strategic energy-saving practices, you can reduce your summer electricity expenses without sacrificing comfort.Here you can explore several effective ways to save on summer electricity bills, offering practical tips and strategies that can help you minimise energy consumption and lower your utility costs during the warmer months. From optimising your cooling system to adopting energy-efficient habits, these recommendations are designed to make a noticeable impact on your electricity expenses while keeping your home cool and comfortable.Let's delve into these actionable tips that can help you save money and energy throughout the summer season.The Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) issues BEE Star Labels as a voluntary method for manufacturers to indicate an appliance's energy efficiency. The label uses stars to indicate the efficiency of a product, with more stars indicating higher efficiency. Simply put, the higher the energy efficiency rating of the appliance, the lower its energy consumption. To effectively reduce your home's energy costs, opt for appliances with a 5-star BEE rating. Not only does this positively impact the environment, but it also helps lower your electricity bills. Explore Crompton's wide range of 5-star rated ceiling fans to learn more about BEE Rating Appliances.If your home still uses CFLs and incandescent bulbs, it's time to replace them with LED bulbs. LED bulbs are not just a trendy choice; they are recognized for their energy efficiency and superior illumination. If you're wondering how to reduce your electricity bill at home, switching to LED bulbs is the solution for you.Upgrading to smart appliances is a highly effective method to decrease electricity consumption at home. These devices allow you to automate tasks and manage energy usage efficiently. Consider installing energy-efficient ceiling fans to further reduce electricity consumption. Smart appliances typically come equipped with remote control capabilities, allowing you to schedule operations and conserve power. Crompton offers remote-controlled fans designed for enhanced energy savings and lower power consumption.These energy-efficient fans are gaining popularity due to their brushless direct current motors (BLDC), which operate on direct current electricity. They can help save up to 60% on electricity compared to normal induction motor-based fans. Additionally, they offer convenient features like remote control for turning the fan on and off, timer functionality, and compatibility with voice assistants. To learn more about the differences between BLDC fans and normal fans and how they can help reduce electricity bills, explore further information on BLDC fans versus conventional fans.Implementing a full solar power system for your home can be a substantial investment. However, there are more accessible and cost-effective ways to leverage solar energy. Installing outdoor solar lights in your balcony and garden, along with solar fans, can notably reduce your energy expenses at a modest cost. Additionally, using solar pumps for daily tasks can contribute to electricity savings. It's beneficial to understand the distinction between an electric geyser and a solar geyser to make an informed choice for your energy needs.Maintain your air conditioner at 24 degrees Celsius to optimise cooling and conserve energy during the summer months, effectively lowering electricity costs. Additionally, using a timer to automate AC operation and upgrading to a 5-star BEE-rated model can further enhance energy efficiency and reduce expenses associated with cooling your space.Numerous advanced smart energy metres are currently offered in the market. These metres typically use Wi-Fi connectivity to monitor overall power usage within a home and provide real-time analysis of consumption patterns. Additionally, they can detect power leaks and identify high-energy-consuming appliances. Wi-Fi LED bulbs represent an excellent choice for reducing electricity usage.Regularly servicing and maintaining your home appliances is essential for optimal functionality and efficiency. Appliances that are not properly maintained are known to consume excessive energy, so routine maintenance can prolong their lifespan and reduce energy consumption. Learn more about the importance of cleaning exhaust fans.Install a power strip if you have several electronic devices or appliances that need to be plugged into a single electrical outlet. This allows you to easily turn off all devices at once when they are not in use, preventing unnecessary energy consumption often referred to as ""phantom"" energy loss.One of the simplest and most effective methods to lower electricity costs is by turning off electrical devices such as lights, fans, and air conditioners when they are not in use.","During summer months, many households experience a significant increase in electricity consumption due to higher cooling needs.
