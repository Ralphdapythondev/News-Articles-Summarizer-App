Summarisation tools will condense articles, web pages, meetings notes, text messages, emails, and even missed notifications.

Reply suggestions will automatically generate complete email and text message responses.

Siri will get an AI revamp, allowing precise control within apps for actions like deleting emails, editing photos, or summarising articles, the report said, adding that Siri integration with third-party apps and multi-command capabilities are planned for next year.

Xcode, Apple's development software, is said to receive AI integration similar to Microsoft's GitHub Copilot, which helps developers write code automatically.

The Mail app is likely to get automatic email categorisation similar to Gmail's feature.

A new AI-powered emoji feature will create custom emoji based on typed phrases or words.

Voice Memos will offer automatic recording transcription, similar to existing features on Google Pixel devices and other apps, the report said.

The Photos app is likely to receive AI-powered photo editing tools for enhancements and object or person removal.

Apple ’s Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) is just around the corner and rumours are rife that the tech giant is expected to announce AI features . Several reports have suggested that the company has partnered with Microsoft-backed OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, for this.According to a report by Bloomberg, the company is also expected to announce updates for iOS (iPhone operating system), iPadOS (iPad operating system), macOS (Mac computer operating system), watchOS (Apple Watch operating system), tvOS (Apple TV operating system) and visionOS (potentially the operating system for future AR/VR devices).The report also noted that several AI features will be “deeply integrated” into some apps. Apple is aiming to announce features that prioritise integrating the technology into existing apps for everyday use while keeping the privacy and security intact, the report said.This means users can opt-in to these features, making them non-mandatory, and AI features will initially be available on iPhone 15 Pro or newer models, or an iPad or Mac with an M1 chip or better.Apple is also expected to offer a mix of both on-device processing and cloud computing for AI tasks, which will depend on complexity. The new operating system will determine the optimal approach for each task.","Siri will get an AI revamp, allowing precise control within apps for actions like deleting emails, editing photos, or summarising articles.

Find My Device app may soon support UWB trackers



Google has reportedly rolled out an update for its Find My Device app. The updated app is expected to help Android users locate devices used by their kids and other family members. This is reportedly the first update for the Find My Device app since the tech giant started rolling out the network.In a post shared on the social media platform X (earlier Twitter), the founder of APKMirror, Artem Russakovski revealed the latest update.The X post also includes screenshots that show how this new feature will work in Google’s Find My Device appAs per the screenshots, the updated Find My Device app has a dedicated tab to show “Family devices.” It is important to note that the tab won't include devices like trackers that have been shared between the user and their kids.However, it may only list Android devices that fall under supervised accounts for children. The X post claims that this new section, which is live by default in Find My Device v3.1.078-1, shows the name of the family member and then lists their devices.According to a report by Android Authority, this tab will only show devices attached to supervised accounts that the user manages despite it being called “Family devices.” The screenshot also showed if users have multiple supervised accounts, they’ll be sorted alphabetically with devices grouped by account.Currently, the Find My Device app helps users to find a nearby tracker by using Bluetooth and other nearby devices to let them know when they’re close to the device. However, Google’s network doesn’t enable users to find the device directionally but can narrow things down The UI of the Find My Device app also allows users to start playing a sound when the tracker is nearby.Another report by Android Authority claims that latest update of the app includes evidence of Google working on expanded support for directional tracking . The report claims code references to Ultra Wide Band (UWB) were spotted in this app update which suggest that Find My Device may soon support UWB and other libraries for similar functionality.",Google has reportedly rolled out an update for its Find My Device app. The updated app is expected to help Android users locate devices used by their kids and other family members.

How Apple is trying to regain its position in China



Apple has achieved a new milestone in iPhone sales. As per data from Stocklytics.com (seen by Patently Apple), the Cupertino-based tech giant has about to reach the $2 trillion mark in iPhone's lifetime sales. This achievement comes after a recent decline in market share due to competition from Chinese brands like Xiaomi and Huawei.Since its introduction in 2007, this has been Apple’s most successful product as the company keeps updating its smartphones with new models and features.As per Statista data, Apple grossed $78.7 billion from iPhone sales within five years after releasing the first mode. Two years later, in FY 2014, this figure jumped to $101.9 billion and continued rising.The tech giant experienced several challenging years, especially in 2019 and 2020 when consumers worldwide reduced their spending budgets amid the pandemic. The report alsoclaims that iPhone sales have doubled and hit record highs in 2022 and 2023.During those two years, Apple grossed over $405 billion from selling iPhones, the highest figures in its history. Despite the revenue figures dropping slightly in the second quarter of FY 2024, iPhone sales remain strong. Statistics show Apple grossed $115.6 billion from iPhone sales in H1 FY 2024, pushing its lifetime revenue to a whopping $1.95 trillion.In Q1 FY 2009, Apple’s iPhone sales also accounted for about a quarter of Apple’s total revenue. Since then, this figure has more than doubled and hit 50.64% in Q1 2024.China is one of the biggest iPhone markets for Apple. According to a report by Counterpoint, Apple’s iPhone sales declined by more than 19% as Huawei saw 70% year-on-year growth in its smartphone sales in the country.To increase iPhone sales in China, Apple reportedly launched an aggressive discounting campaign on its official Tmall website in China in May. With these discounts, the company aims to fight off growing competition from local brands like Huawei. The latest discounts were steeper than those offered earlier this year.","Apple grossed $115.6 billion from iPhone sales in H1 FY 2024, pushing its lifetime revenue to a whopping $1.95 trillion.

During summer months, many households experience a significant increase in electricity consumption due to higher cooling needs. While staying comfortable during hot weather is essential, it doesn't have to come at the cost of soaring electricity bills. By implementing strategic energy-saving practices, you can reduce your summer electricity expenses without sacrificing comfort.Here you can explore several effective ways to save on summer electricity bills, offering practical tips and strategies that can help you minimise energy consumption and lower your utility costs during the warmer months. From optimising your cooling system to adopting energy-efficient habits, these recommendations are designed to make a noticeable impact on your electricity expenses while keeping your home cool and comfortable.Let's delve into these actionable tips that can help you save money and energy throughout the summer season.The Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) issues BEE Star Labels as a voluntary method for manufacturers to indicate an appliance's energy efficiency. The label uses stars to indicate the efficiency of a product, with more stars indicating higher efficiency. Simply put, the higher the energy efficiency rating of the appliance, the lower its energy consumption. To effectively reduce your home's energy costs, opt for appliances with a 5-star BEE rating. Not only does this positively impact the environment, but it also helps lower your electricity bills. Explore Crompton's wide range of 5-star rated ceiling fans to learn more about BEE Rating Appliances.If your home still uses CFLs and incandescent bulbs, it's time to replace them with LED bulbs. LED bulbs are not just a trendy choice; they are recognized for their energy efficiency and superior illumination. If you're wondering how to reduce your electricity bill at home, switching to LED bulbs is the solution for you.Upgrading to smart appliances is a highly effective method to decrease electricity consumption at home. These devices allow you to automate tasks and manage energy usage efficiently. Consider installing energy-efficient ceiling fans to further reduce electricity consumption. Smart appliances typically come equipped with remote control capabilities, allowing you to schedule operations and conserve power. Crompton offers remote-controlled fans designed for enhanced energy savings and lower power consumption.These energy-efficient fans are gaining popularity due to their brushless direct current motors (BLDC), which operate on direct current electricity. They can help save up to 60% on electricity compared to normal induction motor-based fans. Additionally, they offer convenient features like remote control for turning the fan on and off, timer functionality, and compatibility with voice assistants. To learn more about the differences between BLDC fans and normal fans and how they can help reduce electricity bills, explore further information on BLDC fans versus conventional fans.Implementing a full solar power system for your home can be a substantial investment. However, there are more accessible and cost-effective ways to leverage solar energy. Installing outdoor solar lights in your balcony and garden, along with solar fans, can notably reduce your energy expenses at a modest cost. Additionally, using solar pumps for daily tasks can contribute to electricity savings. It's beneficial to understand the distinction between an electric geyser and a solar geyser to make an informed choice for your energy needs.Maintain your air conditioner at 24 degrees Celsius to optimise cooling and conserve energy during the summer months, effectively lowering electricity costs. Additionally, using a timer to automate AC operation and upgrading to a 5-star BEE-rated model can further enhance energy efficiency and reduce expenses associated with cooling your space.Numerous advanced smart energy metres are currently offered in the market. These metres typically use Wi-Fi connectivity to monitor overall power usage within a home and provide real-time analysis of consumption patterns. Additionally, they can detect power leaks and identify high-energy-consuming appliances. Wi-Fi LED bulbs represent an excellent choice for reducing electricity usage.Regularly servicing and maintaining your home appliances is essential for optimal functionality and efficiency. Appliances that are not properly maintained are known to consume excessive energy, so routine maintenance can prolong their lifespan and reduce energy consumption. Learn more about the importance of cleaning exhaust fans.Install a power strip if you have several electronic devices or appliances that need to be plugged into a single electrical outlet. This allows you to easily turn off all devices at once when they are not in use, preventing unnecessary energy consumption often referred to as ""phantom"" energy loss.One of the simplest and most effective methods to lower electricity costs is by turning off electrical devices such as lights, fans, and air conditioners when they are not in use.","During summer months, many households experience a significant increase in electricity consumption due to higher cooling needs.
