OpenAI , the artificial intelligence company behind the chatbot ChatGPT, is testing an experimental search product called SearchGPT.

This search, dubbed SearchGPT , will initially be available to a select group of users who've waitlisted themselves.“We’re testing SearchGPT, a temporary prototype of new AI search features that give you fast and timely answers with clear and relevant sources. We’re launching with a small group of users for feedback and plan to integrate the experience into ChatGPT,"" said the company, in a blog post.OpenAI has collaborated with sevem major publishers, including News Corp, Axel Springer, and the Financial Times itself, to develop and refine SearchGPT.The launch of SearchGPT comes at a time when Google is also incorporating AI into its search results, albeit cautiously. The search giant has begun displaying AI-generated summaries for common queries, but this approach has faced challenges, including instances of inaccurate or misleading information.OpenAI claims that its search tool will ""provide up-to-date information from the web while giving you clear links to relevant sources,"" addressing one of the main criticisms of AI-powered search tools, their tendency to ""hallucinate"" or generate inaccurate information.SearchGPT distinguishes itself from OpenAI's popular ChatGPT by offering a more traditional search engine interface, complete with clickable links to external websites.Altman and co.

Google has announced a “big upgrade” to its Gemini AI chatbot . It said that it is bringing the Gemini 1.5 Flash large language model (LLM) to the free version of its chatbot, thereby offering faster response times and improved accuracy.“Today we’re upgrading our free-tier experience to Gemini 1.5 Flash. With Gemini 1.5 Flash, you’ll notice across-the-board improvements in quality and latency, with especially noticeable improvements in reasoning and image understanding,” the company said.The company also said that it is quadrupling the context window of Gemini to 32K tokens – the basic units of input and output in a language model.This means users can have longer back-and-forth conversations and ask Gemini more complex questions for free.The company also said that it will soon add the ability to upload files via Google Drive or directly from smartphone or PC – a feature available in Gemini Advanced.Gemini 1.5 Flash is now available to all Gemini users on both web and mobile, in more than 40 languages and over 230 countries and territories.To enhance accuracy, Gemini will also provide links to related content within its responses, allowing users to verify information, hence, reducing hallucinations – a concept where an AI chatbot presents inaccurate responses in a way that they seem correct.The capability is available for English language prompts in certain countries. To access the additional information on topics directly within Gemini’s responses, users can click on the chip at the end of a paragraph to see websites where you can dive deeper on a certain topic.Google is also expanding Gemini's availability to more countries and platforms, including Google Messages and the Gemini mobile app. The company is also introducing a version of Gemini tailored for teenagers, with additional safety measures in place.","Gemini 1.5 Flash is now available to all Gemini users on both web and mobile, in more than 40 languages and over 230 countries and territories.

Nvidia is developing a customised Al chip for China to navigate US export controls . A report has now claimed that the US-based chipmaker is also working on a special server, as it seeks to maintain its presence in China while complying with stringent US export controls.The Information reports that “Nvidia has a new workaround to US export rules that block the sale of the advanced AI chips to China – pairing the chips with a special server.” Notably, this will be the first time that Nvidia will introduce a new server for the market.Citing two people involved in developing the server, the publication notes that next year, Nvidia will sell a new Al chip specially tailored for the Chinese market that will be sold alongside a new server designed to maximise the performance of the chip.The report comes days after news agency Reuters claimed that Nvidia is building an AI chip specifically designed for sale in China as it aims to keep the revenue stream flowing from one of its important markets.The report said Nvidia will work with Inspur – one of the American chipmaker’s major distributor partners in China – for the launch and distribution of the chip.In March, Nvidia unveiled its “Blackwell” chip series and theB200 model and the chip for the Chinese market is tentatively named the “B20”. The “Blackwell” chip series will go into mass production later this year.The “Blackwell” chip series’ B200 model is said to be 30 times speedier than its predecessor at some tasks like providing answers from chatbots.These chips are also claimed to enable organisations to build and run real-time generative AI on trillion-parameter large language models at up to 25x less cost and energy consumption than its predecessor.","N Nvidia is developing a customised Al chip for China to navigate US export controls.

Google’s AI Overviews

Microsoft has announced that it is testing a new AI-powered search experience on Bing . The company shared an early view of the new generative search experience, which is being shipped to a small percentage of user queries.The update combines traditional search results with AI-generated summaries to provide users with a more comprehensive and informative search experience.Microsoft says that the new feature aims to offer users a clear and concise answer to their query, accompanied by relevant search results.“For example, if a user searches ‘What is a spaghetti western?’ Bing shows an AI-generated experience that dives into the film subgenre, including its history and origins, top examples and more,” Microsoft explained while adding that the information that will be reflected “is easy to read and understand, with links and sources that show where it came from or let the user dive deeper.”The regular search results, however, will continue to be prominently displayed on the page like it always has been.Microsoft said that Bing is using large language models (LLMs) to process information from millions of sources and present it in a user-friendly format.“We've refined our methods to optimise accuracy in Bing, applying those insights as we continue to evolve our use of LLMs in search,” it added.The company emphasised that it is ensuring that the new feature does not negatively impact website traffic.“We are continuing to look closely at how generative search impacts traffic to publishers. Early data indicates that this experience maintains the number of clicks to websites and supports a healthy web ecosystem. The generative search experience is designed with this in mind, including retaining traditional search results and increasing the number of clickable links, like the references in the results,” it added.Microsoft’s latest feature is similar to Google Search’s AI Overviews feature that provides answers to some queries, similar to “What is a spaghetti western?” question that Microsoft used as an example. Recently, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said that the company is seeing great progress with AI Overviews.“We are pleased to see the positive trends from our testing continue as we roll out AI Overviews, including increases in Search usage and increased user satisfaction with the results. People who are looking for help with complex topics are engaging more and keep coming back for AI Overviews,” he said in the investors call after Google-parent Alphabet announced the Q2 2024 results.",Microsoft is testing a new AI-powered search experience on Bing.

Karnataka reservation bill: PhonePe CEO and founder Sameer Nigam issues this 'personal statement',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/karnataka-reservation-bill-phonepe-ceo-and-founder-sameer-nigam-issues-this-personal-statement/articleshow/111908948.cms,"Read PhonePe CEO Sameer Nigam’s personal note

“PhonePe was born in Bengaluru and we are incredibly proud of our roots in this city, which is well known for its world-class technology talent and vibrant diversity. From Bengaluru, over the past decade we have expanded across the length and breadth of India and been able to deliver secure and efficient digital payments for over 55 Crore Indians.

Bengaluru's reputation as the ""Silicon valley of India"" is truly well-deserved. The city thrives on an incredible culture of innovation, and attracts the most brilliant young minds from Karnataka and the rest of India. As a company, we are deeply grateful for the supportive business environment that Karnataka’s governments and its local

Kannadiga

populace have offered us. Without such an inclusive ecosystem and progressive policies, Bengaluru would not have become a global technology superpower.

As a company we also thrive on celebrating diversity, we have always tried hard to deliver fair, unbiased and meritocracy-based employment opportunities for all Indians - including to all local Kannadigas. We believe such an approach gives every Indian a good job a chance to shine, and ultimately helps create more societal and economic value for Bengaluru, Karnataka and India.

I read some recent media articles, relating to a few personal comments that I made last week regarding the draft job reservation bill. I would first and foremost like to clarify that it was NEVER my intention to insult Karnataka and it’s people. If my comments hurt anyone’s sentiments in such a way, I am truly sorry and would like to offer you an unconditional apology. I have the highest regard for Kannada, and all other Indian languages. In fact, I truly believe that linguistic diversity and rich cultural heritage is a national asset that all Indians should be proud of; and all Indians should be respectful of and celebrate local and cultural norms.

Bengaluru’s Indian startups are competing against trillion dollar giants like Google, Apple, Amazon and Microsoft. To do so, these companies must be able to employ the very best talent available in India purely based on their technology skills and proficiency in fields such as Coding, Design, Product Management, Data Sciences, Machine Learning, AI and beyond. As a nation, that is the only way we can build world-class companies that can compete in the global village that we live in today.

I also want to help create lakhs of jobs for Bengaluru and Karnataka. And, I believe with more dialogue and discussion, we can find ways to create more sustainable employment avenues. Let’s all work together to do this meaningfully and while creating long-term impact.”

PhonePe CEO Sameer Nigam issued a personal note following backlash over his comments on Karnataka 's job reservation bill. The controversy erupted after Nigam criticised the bill on social media platform X, questioning whether his children deserved jobs in their home city given his company's pan-India job creation.""If my comments hurt anyone's sentiments, I am truly sorry and would like to offer you an unconditional apology,"" Nigam said in a statement.He emphasised his 22-year connection to Bengaluru and respect for linguistic diversity.The Karnataka Cabinet had recently approved a bill mandating 50% reservation for locals in management roles and 70% in non-management positions within private companies. The bill, which also proposed 100% quota for locals in certain government jobs, was put on hold after industry backlash.Nigam stressed the need for merit-based hiring to build globally competitive companies.
