How Android smartphone users can protect themselves

* Keep apps updated:

* Install from trusted sources:

* Be cautious of permissions:

Microsoft researchers recently discovered vulnerabilities in several popular Android applications, totaling over 4 billion downloads according to a blog post by Microsoft's Threat Intelligence Team. These security flaws could have allowed attackers to steal sensitive user data.The specific issue identified is called a ""dirty stream"" attack, where a malicious app could potentially overwrite settings on a vulnerable device and gain access to a user's authentication tokens or other confidential information.This information could then be used to impersonate the user and potentially access their accounts or data on other services.This app has over 1 billion installs.This popular office suite has over 500 million installs.Both Xiaomi and WPS Office have since addressed the vulnerabilities with updates. However, Microsoft recommends that all Android users update these apps immediately if they are installed on their devices.While both Xiaomi and WPS have patched the security loophole, but millions of users may still be at risk if they haven't updated their apps. It is important for users to have updated these apps to protect themselves from these security flaws.Regularly update your apps through the Google Play Store or other trusted sources to ensure you have the latest security patches.Only download apps from reputable developers and stores to minimize the risk of malware.Pay attention to the permissions requested by apps before installing them. Granting unnecessary permissions can increase your risk.Microsoft has also collaborated with Google to inform app developers and help them avoid similar vulnerabilities in the future. This collaboration between security researchers and tech companies is crucial in keeping users safe in an evolving threat landscape.",Microsoft researchers recently discovered vulnerabilities in several popular Android applications.

How Apple aims to tell an AI story in a way different than Google and Microsoft,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-apple-aims-to-tell-an-ai-story-in-a-way-different-than-google-and-microsoft/articleshow/109824897.cms,"There may be no big AI bills for Apple

For over a year, analysts have pressed Apple CEO Tim Cook for details on the company's artificial intelligence (AI) plans. According to Reuters, Cook recently hinted that those details are coming soon. ""[We] continue to feel very bullish about our opportunity in generative AI and we're making significant investments,"" Cook told Reuters.While Apple's Big Tech competitors like Google and Microsoft have been pouring money into building data centers to support their AI services, Apple is taking a different approach, according to Reuters.Apple spent a significantly smaller $10 billion on capital expenditures in 2023 compared to its rivals' $12-$40 billion range. This focus on on-device processing reflects a longstanding Apple strategy of partnering with suppliers to manage manufacturing costs, says Reuters.Apple is expected to unveil new AI features at its upcoming software conference and integrate AI-ready chips into its products, but investors shouldn't expect a major shift in capital expenditure practices, says a Reuters report. Apple CFO Luca Maestri said that the company will likely continue its split-cost model with data centers, similar to its approach with manufacturing tools. ""We do something similar on the data center side,"" Maestri said. ""We have our own data center capacity, and then we use capacity from third parties. It's a model that has worked well for us historically, and we plan to continue along the same lines going forward.""The success of this on-device AI strategy remains to be seen, according to Reuters. While some analysts believe better on-device processing will entice professional users, it may not be a game-changer for overall sales.","Apple spent a significantly smaller $10 billion on capital expenditures in 2023 compared to its rivals' $12-$40 billion range.

Huang & Nvidia’s journey from bankruptcy to $2 trillion dollars

Jensen Huang , the founder and CEO of Nvidia , has led the company to a staggering $2 trillion valuation, making it the third most valuable company in the world. Huang's success can be attributed to his relentless work ethic, engaged leadership style, and dedication to his role as the ""custodian of the culture"" at Nvidia.Huang's workday begins at 6 a.m.after he wakes up and exercises. He then embarks on a gruelling 14-hour workday, often working through holidays and weekends. Despite the long hours, Huang finds his work relaxing and loves what he does. He believes that struggle and pain are character-building and necessary for achieving greatness.Unlike many Big Tech CEOs, Huang prioritises communication with his employees. He frequently eats in the company cafeteria to connect with staff and has 60 direct reports. Huang encourages open communication across the company, asking employees to send him the top five things on their minds. He believes this approach helps with problem-solving and empowers people by giving them equal access to information.Huang's leadership style has been instrumental in Nvidia's success. The company nearly went bankrupt in the late 1990s, a memory that Huang says is hard to shake off. However, under his guidance, Nvidia has become a significant player in the tech industry , with a surge in stock driven by the demand for its chips for AI applications .Despite his success, Huang remains humble and driven. He wakes up ""worried and concerned"" each day and is known for his high standards and demanding nature. Huang believes CEOs should have the most direct reports in an organisation, as they can help lead others to greatness and inspire and empower people.To manage his time effectively, Huang sometimes clears his calendar to focus on areas he believes will have a long-lasting influence on the company, such as product and strategy planning. He also acknowledges that, as a CEO, not sleeping is often a good choice to free up time.Huang's dedication and leadership have made Nvidia a tech giant and earned him a spot as the 20th richest person in the world, with an estimated net worth of $73 billion.",Jensen Huang is the founder and CEO of Nvidia.

"Samsung tops Apple in global smartphone shipments: How Oppo, Vivo and other brands performed",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/samsung-tops-apple-in-global-smartphone-shipments-how-oppo-vivo-and-other-brands-performed/articleshow/109822977.cms,"What led Samsung’s growth and how other brands fared

Overall global smartphone market grows

Samsung has replaced Apple as the top smartphone player globally in the first quarter this year (Q1 2024), accounting for 20% shipment share, a report said on Friday. Apple’s shipments declined 13% (YoY) owing to high inventory build-up during the last quarter, however, the brand’s average selling price (ASP) grew 2% YoY, said Counterpoint Research in its latest research.It took the second spot.Samsung re-captured the top spot, driven by the early refresh of the Galaxy-A-series and strong performance of the Galaxy S24 series. Samsung reached its highest-ever ASP during the quarter as well. Apple’s performance was a mixed bag.“Tough competition in China, record low upgrades in the US and a difficult compare from last year due to iPhone 14 Pro’s supply shifting to Q1 2023 all weighed on iPhone performance,” said research director Jeff Fieldhack.“However, there were upsides as well. An improved product mix with 15 Pro’s performing better than its predecessors, and an increasing footprint in emerging markets, helped Apple in arresting some of the declines. Emerging markets especially provide long term growth opportunities,” Fieldhack added.Meanwhile, smartphone brands from China – Xiaomi and Vivo – registered growth. While Xiaomi registered growth in almost all its key markets, Vivo posted strong performance in emerging markets of Asia Pacific including India.Huawei, Honor and Transsion also gained during the quarter. Huawei made gains in China, Honor gained in Caribbean And Latin America and Middle East and North Africa, in addition to having a strong share in China.The Transsion brands – Tecno, itel and Infinix, performed strongly in APAC, Eastern Europe, India and the MEA. Oppo – which includes OnePlus – experienced a shipment decline due to stiff competition in key markets like China.Riding the success of these brands, the global smartphone market grew by 6% year-on-year (YoY) to reach 296.9 million unit shipments. The growth is mostly attributed to the strong performance in key regions such as Europe, Middle East and Africa (MEA) and Caribbean and Latin America (CALA).“The India market also saw growth thanks to exiting 2023 with healthy inventory levels. The mature markets of North America and Japan declined relative to the same period in 2023,” said senior analyst Prachir Singh.Global smartphone revenues grew by 7% in Q1 2024 and reached the highest-ever in the first quarter of the year.","Samsung re-captured the top spot, driven by the early refresh of the Galaxy-A- series.

"ChatGPT maker OpenAI’s CEO Sam Altman: This is the ""dumbest model any of you will ever, ever have to use again....""",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/chatgpt-maker-openais-ceo-sam-altman-this-is-the-dumbest-model-any-of-you-will-ever-ever-have-to-use-again-/articleshow/109822309.cms,"What to expect from GPT-5 and GPT-6



ChatGPT maker OpenAI ’s CEO Sam Altman has said that the AI chatbot developed by the company is not phenomenal and that the large language model (LLM) – GPT 4 – that powers it is the “dumbest model”. He also hinted that the successive models that the company may launch in future will comparatively be much more powerful than the ones individuals and businesses use today.Altman was replying to a question on the economic model of the company in a session at an event hosted by Ravi Belani, a Stanford lecturer.Belani asked about the monetisation source for the company that spent $520 million of cash last year in making ChatGPT “phenomenal”.“Well, first of all, that's nice of you to say, but ChatGPT is not phenomenal. ChatGPT is mildly embarrassing at best. GPT 4 is the dumbest model any of you will ever, ever have to use again by a lot,” he said in the session.“But, you know, it's important to ship early and often and we believe in iterative deployment. Like if we go build AGI in a basement and then, you know, the world is like kind of blissfully walking blindfolded along. I don't think that makes us very good neighbours,” he added.He emphasised that expressing opinions about the future of a technology isn't enough and that the best way to understand its impact is to release it and let society experiment with it. He noted that in this way, the society is allowed to provide feedback on how the technology is used and its potential benefits and drawbacks.“Whether we burn 500 million a year or 5 billion or 50 billion a year, I don't care. I genuinely don't. As long as we can, I think, stay on a trajectory where eventually we create way more value for society than that and as long as we can figure out a way to pay the bills like we're making AGI, it's gonna be expensive. It's totally worth it,” he added.Altman also talked about the next-generation of models. While OpenAI is yet to announce or even name the next model, the CEO said that the next models will be more powerful and smarter than what it is today.“I think the most important thing about GPT-5, or whatever we call (it), is that it’s going to be smarter. And this sounds like a dodge. But, I think that among the most remarkable facts in human history is that we can just do something and we can say right now with a high degree of scientific certainty, GPT-5 is going to be a lot smarter than GPT-4. GPT-6 is going to be a lot smarter than GPT-5 and we are not near the top of this curve,” said Altman.",ChatGPT maker OpenAI’s CEO Sam Altman has said that the AI chatbot developed by the company is not phenomenal.

You're my favourite hello and hardest goodbye.

With you, every moment is a fairytale.

I'm much more 'me' when I'm with you.

Love is the greatest adventure.

In your arms is where I belong.

You're the reason for my smile.

Together is my favourite place to be.

Love made me believe in fairytales.

You stole my heart, but I'll let you keep it.

I fall in love with you every single day.

You are my sunshine on a cloudy day.

Forever is not enough with you.

Love is composed of a single soul inhabiting two bodies.

You're my happy place.

Love at first sight is easy to understand; it's when two people have been looking at each other for a lifetime that it becomes a miracle.

In your eyes, I see my whole world.

I never want to stop making memories with you.

You are the best thing that's ever been mine.

Every love story is beautiful, but ours is my favourite.

My heart is and always will be yours.

You are the love I've been waiting for.

I choose you. And I'll choose you over and over and over.

Love is not about how much you say 'I love you,' but how much you can prove that it's true.

You are my happily ever after.

Your love is all I need to feel complete.

To the world, you may be one person, but to me, you are the world.

Apple posted double-digit growth in India during the March quarter of 2024 despite an overall 4 percent revenue decline year-over-year. CEO Tim Cook couldn't be more ""pleased"" about the company's robust performance in the country. In a post-earnings conference call, Cook stated, ""We did grow strong double-digit. And so we were very, very pleased about it.It was a new March quarter revenue record for us.""Cook stressed the importance of manufacturing iPhones in India to remain competitive. ""In terms of the operational side or supply chain side, we are producing there, from a pragmatic point of view, you need to produce there to be competitive,"" he said.Apple has been ramping up its iPhone assembly in India over the past few years, partnering with contract manufacturers to produce a range of models, from the iPhone 12 to the latest iPhone 15. The company aims to make 25% of its iPhone production in India by 2025 as it seeks to diversify its supply chain and reduce reliance on China.In addition to being bullish on local manufacturing, Apple has also been increasing its retail footprint in India. The company opened two new stores in Mumbai and Delhi last year, and both stores are reported to be making an average of Rs 16-17 crores a month.""We just opened a couple of stores last year, as you know, and we see enormous opportunity there. We're continuing to expand our channels, and also working on the developer ecosystem as well,"" Cook said, emphasising the potential for growth in India.Last month, The Economic Times reported that Apple is scouting new locations to open three new stores, which could be in the cities of Pune, Bangalore, and Noida.Apple has also been focusing on nurturing thedeveloper community in India, recognizing the country's vast tech talent pool. The company last told in 2023 that it has over a million developer jobs in India, and from Cook’s comment, Apple seems to be actively working to expand its ecosystem.""We've been very pleased that there is a rapidly-growing base of developers there. And so, we're working all of the entire ecosystem from developer to the market to operations, the whole thing,"" Cook said, highlighting Apple's holistic approach to engaging with the developer community.Luca Maestri, Apple's Chief Financial Officer, highlighted the company's strong performance in emerging markets, including India.

A captivating romance can uplift anyone's spirits, and anime has a unique ability to vividly portray these narratives. Over the years, Japanese animation has delivered numerous romantic tales, ranging from light-hearted comedies to deeply emotional dramas.For romance enthusiasts, going through so many anime options can be overwhelming. However, there are several exceptional romance anime series that truly shine above the rest.Here is a curated list of top romance anime series , compiled by Game Rant, along with their respective rankings.Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie stirred mixed reactions upon its debut in Spring 2022, often compared to ""My Dress-Up Darling"" but standing out as a unique slice-of-life anime centred around a charming couple, Shikimori and Yuu Izumi.One distinctive aspect of the series is its portrayal of the main couple already in a relationship, a rarity in anime. While the episodes focus on everyday moments, they paint a wholesome picture of young love with two endearing characters navigating the nuances of romance.Describing Bakemonogatari as a straightforward romance might be a stretch, but this instalment of Monogatari indeed focuses on and highlights the relationship between Koyomi Araragi and Hitagi Senjougahara. Their initial interactions are unconventional, involving a stapler to the face, but Araragi's determination to assist Senjougahara with her curse ultimately brings them closer.Despite the surreal and eccentric nature of Monogatari, the romance between Araragi and Senjougahara is remarkably grounded and healthy. While the series introduces other potential romantic interests, their relationship remains steadfast and central to the narrative.""Sing 'Yesterday' for Me"" presents romance in a refreshingly realistic manner compared to many other anime. The series takes a classic love triangle and steers it in an unexpected direction by the end, resulting in a highly satisfying conclusion that portrays how failed romances can evolve into strong friendships.Directed by Yoshiyuki Fujiwara, known for his work on popular anime like ""Attack on Titan"" and ""Sword Art Online,"" the shift to a show with such a different tone demonstrates his versatility and mastery in storytelling across diverse genres.""My Happy Marriage"" emerged as one of the standout romance anime of Summer 2023, adapted from Akumi Agitogi's novel series. Set in an alternate Meiji Restoration era with supernatural elements, the story follows Miyo, who endures mistreatment from her stepfamily despite her privileged background. Her family arranges her marriage to a notorious military figure known for rejecting wives quickly, with rejection spelling disaster for Miyo. However, Kiyoka surprises everyone by taking an interest in Miyo and becoming incensed by her family's cruelty.The anime delves into the lasting impact of Miyo's abuse, highlighting her struggle to regain self-worth, even with Kiyoka's support. Kiyoka himself is a complex character with hidden motives behind his initial attraction to Miyo, although his feelings for her are genuine.While the romance between Miyo and Kiyoka is heartwarming, ""My Happy Marriage"" falls short in other areas. The supernatural elements can seem disjointed, and the villains are one-dimensional despite being detestable.Based on Fumita Yanagida's popular and finished manga, ""Tomo-chan Is a Girl!"" stood out as one of Winter 2023's most amusing romantic comedies. Tomo and Jun share a close friendship, but Jun sees Tomo strictly as a friend, unaware of her romantic feelings.While romance is central to its characters, ""Tomo-chan Is a Girl!"" leans heavily into comedy. Tomo and Jun's dynamic is charming, and they're supported by entertaining characters like Misuzu and Carol. Despite its comedic tone, the chemistry between Tomo and Jun develops convincingly over the season. Unlike some romance anime, Tomo-chan excels in portraying why its leads are compatible without difficulty.Teen romance anime often dominate the genre, but there are exceptions worth noting. ""Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku"" is primarily a workplace comedy that revolves around two couples: the newly formed pair of Hirotaka Nifuji and Narumi Momose, and the more established couple, Tarou Kabakura and Hanako Koyanagi. The focus remains on Hirotaka and Narumi, with the series emphasising humour over romance, but Tarou and Hanako's relationship is depicted realistically.Despite being childhood friends, Narumi struggles to see Hirotaka as a potential romantic interest, a dynamic that persists throughout the series. The anime's brevity limits the depth of these relationships, but ""Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku"" provides an entertaining journey within its runtime.""Romantic Killer"" cleverly parodies romance and harem anime while paying homage to their core strengths. Anzu, a girl with no interest in boys, is suddenly thrust into a reverse harem scenario by a magical being, disrupting her life of gaming and chocolate consumption. Unamused by her newfound romantic entanglements with unfamiliar guys, Anzu navigates this unconventional situation with scepticism.Primarily a comedy, ""Romantic Killer"" aims to elicit laughter from its audience, often succeeding with its humour rooted in its origins as a shonen manga, characterised by exaggerated facial expressions.Though not always aiming for emotional depth, the anime treats its characters and their relationships seriously. Anzu shines as a compelling lead, and the male characters introduced as potential partners are well-developed. ""Romantic Killer"" offers a delightful blend of humour and romance for those seeking an entertaining and unconventional love story.""The Angel Next Door Spoils Me Rotten"" captivates viewers from the start for several reasons. Firstly, Project No.9's animation is impressive, featuring clean and detailed character designs. Secondly, and most importantly, the main characters exhibit instant chemistry, evident when Amane offers his umbrella to a soaked Mahiru, sparking a connection.Throughout the series, despite the frequent presence of both leads on screen, ""The Angel Next Door Spoils Me Rotten"" effectively delves into their individual personalities while also developing their friendship.Rumiko Takahashi is celebrated as a legendary mangaka, known for classics like Inuyasha, Ranma 1/2, and Urusei Yatsura. While most of her renowned works fall within the shonen genre, Takahashi has also ventured into seinen storytelling. Maison Ikkoku stands out as one of her most mature works, emphasising romance as its primary theme.Unlike Takahashi's prominent shonen series that explore various genres such as comedy and action alongside romance, Maison Ikkoku focuses squarely on romantic elements, enriched with drama, character development, and humour.The central relationship features Kyouko and Yuusaku, both drawn to each other but hindered by their circumstances. Kyouko, grieving the recent loss of her husband, is hesitant to move forward. Meanwhile, Yuusaku, deeply in love with Kyouko, doubts his worthiness as a student. The anime chronicles their journeys of growth, healing, and mutual misunderstanding, complemented by well-developed secondary characters.Insomniacs After School emerged as the standout romance of Spring 2023, adapted from Makoto Ojiro's esteemed seinen manga. The story revolves around two students plagued by insomnia, a burden they carried alone until they met at their school's observatory. Isaki and Ganta form an immediate bond, which deepens as they work together to revive the Astronomy Club, driven by their shared need to preserve their newfound sanctuary.The anime boasts impeccable pacing, skillfully depicting the protagonists' isolation due to insomnia and the subtle solace they find in each other. While romance is a central theme, the series prioritises developing Ganta and Isaki's friendship before advancing their relationship, emphasising the depth of their connection beyond shared circumstances.Kokoro Connect injects a supernatural twist into a classic love triangle scenario. The story centers around Taichi, Iori, Yui, Yoshifumi, and Himeko, students of the Student Cultural Research Club, whose lives take a turn when they receive supernatural abilities from a mysterious being named Heartseed.As they grapple with these newfound powers, the group experiences sensory phenomena that challenge their relationships and reveal hidden aspects of their personalities. The anime is rich in character development, providing an engaging and thought-provoking experience.Maid Sama! carries many tropes that might derail other romance anime: an overly perfect male lead, a strong female protagonist reduced to a damsel, and an unnecessary love triangle. Despite these shortcomings, Maid Sama! shines through its strong personality.The heart of Maid Sama! lies in the relationship between Takumi Usui, a charming heartthrob, and Misaki Ayuzawa, a strict student council president with a busy schedule balancing school, home, and work. When Takumi discovers Misaki's secret job at a maid cafe, it opens a new perspective on the usually composed president.In ""Rascal Does Not Dream Of Bunny Girl Senpai,"" romance plays a subtle yet compelling role that defines the series. The story centers on Sakuta Azusagawa, a high school student drawn to girls suffering from Adolescence Syndrome, a condition linked to their insecurities.While the anime unfolds through different arcs focusing on various girls, the standout is the initial saga featuring Mai Sakurajima, an actress who forms a close bond with Sakuta. Their dynamic crackles with romantic tension, warmth, and clever banter. Although not always in the foreground, their relationship develops steadily across subsequent arcs, leading to a satisfying sequel in the form of a feature film.Wakana Gojou and Marin Kitagawa inhabit completely contrasting worlds. Gojou, isolated and reserved, keeps himself apart from others due to his passion for hina dolls, fearing ridicule. In contrast, Kitagawa is popular, outgoing, and self-assured.Despite their differences, Kitagawa becomes intrigued by cosplay and sees Gojou as the ideal person to create outfits for her. ""My Dress-Up Darling"" is a charming, humorous, and beautifully animated romance anime that excels in executing classic genre tropes with finesse.""Toradora!"" is a beloved slice-of-life romantic comedy that offers a wonderful entry point into the genre. The story revolves around Ryuji Yusaku and Taiga Aisaka, two students who have crushes on each other's best friends.Both Ryuji and Taiga are viewed as outcasts—Ryuji due to his intimidating appearance and Taiga because of her fiery temper. They team up to assist each other in their romantic pursuits. The series delves into their evolving dynamic and the humorous mishaps that ensue as they navigate their intertwined love lives.""The Pet Girl of Sakurasou"" depicts the journey of an eccentric group of characters as they navigate growth and self-discovery. Sorata Kanda is forced to move into the unconventional Sakura House after being kicked out of his school's main dorms.In Sakura House, Sorata encounters talented yet troubled students. When a peculiar young artist joins the dorm, Sorata takes on the responsibility of helping her adjust to her new life. The series delves into the interactions among the dorm mates, their personal aspirations, and the interconnected nature of their relationships.""Ouran High School Host Club"" is a delightful reverse harem anime filled with lighthearted and meaningful moments. Haruhi Fujioka accidentally breaks an antique vase belonging to her school's Host Club and must repay her debt by disguising herself as a boy and working as a host.The series excels in developing Haruhi's character along with her fellow hosts, providing insight into their motivations and personalities. It's a must-watch for shojo fans, featuring a memorable cast of characters that carries the show through its run.Kyoto Animation has produced many beloved anime, and ""Love, Chunibyo & Other Delusions!"" is among them. The series centers around a phenomenon known as Chunibyo, where adolescents have grandiose and unrealistic delusions.Yuta Togashi, who has outgrown his delusional phase, aims for a normal high school life. However, things take a turn when his classmate, Rikka Takanashi, reminds him of his past and tries to pull him back into the world of Chunibyo with her own delusions. The series delves into their relationship as Yuta unravels the triggers behind Rikka's delusions.The trope of opposites attracting may be overused, but when done well, it can lead to a captivating romantic comedy. ""Kimi ni Todoke"" explores the endearing friendship between the shy Sawako Kuronuma and the popular Shouta Kazehaya. Sawako, often mistaken for Sadako from ""The Ring,"" is isolated at school due to her appearance, making it challenging for her to break out of her shell. Fortunately, Kazehaya is just the right person to help her.""Kimi ni Todoke"" is a delightful and heartwarming anime with well-developed characters who evolve as the story unfolds. While it adheres to typical romance anime pacing, the journey remains engaging and enjoyable.Unlike most romance stories that focus on the process of falling in love, ""Tonikawa: Over The Moon For You"" follows a married couple who have already reached that point. As a result, the anime adopts a slice-of-life approach, showcasing Nasa and Tsukasa's daily life and antics rather than a typical romantic journey. ""Tonikawa"" doesn't rely on dramatic highs but instead offers a pleasant and light-hearted experience.While this anime may not appeal to everyone, it serves as a refreshing departure from more melodramatic romance shows. Despite their tendency to blush at the slightest physical contact, Nasa and Tsukasa are refreshingly direct in expressing their feelings, making them both witty and likeable characters.This romantic anime shines because of its main character, Takeo Gouda. His towering, imposing presence contrasts beautifully with his heartfelt affection for the delicate Rinko, which is truly heartwarming. Takeo's efforts to play matchmaker for Rinko with his best friend, despite his own feelings, demonstrate his genuine kindness.Viewers will undoubtedly root for Takeo and Rinko's endearing relationship. ""My Love Story!!"" delivers the goods without delay, as the main characters are dating for most of the episodes, bypassing the typical slow build-up to a confession.""A Sign of Affection"" is a heartwarming romantic comedy centred on college-age love and the challenges of communication. While not the sole focus of the story, Yuki and Itsuomi stand out as the main couple, instantly captivating viewers. Yuki, who is hearing-impaired, communicates using sign language, text, and by reading lips, while Itsuomi is a world traveller passionate about learning languages. Their connection begins on a train and grows stronger with each subsequent encounter.The anime beautifully captures the intense emotions of falling in love, highlighted by a poignant moment in the opening episode. With an older cast, ""A Sign of Affection"" takes on a more mature tone compared to typical romance anime. Throughout the season, Yuki and Itsuomi become increasingly comfortable around each other, resulting in consistently endearing interactions.This romantic anime is ideal for LGBTQ+ viewers seeking representation on screen, but its well-crafted storytelling makes it enjoyable for all audiences. The heartwarming romance blossoms between Mafuyu and Ritsuka as Mafuyu learns to play guitar and sing in Ritsuka's band.Watching Mafuyu's growing confidence alongside the romantic tension creates a compelling series that's hard to resist. The accompanying movie is also outstanding and a must-watch continuation of the series.Nana is one of the most renowned and beloved shoujo anime of all time, a must-watch for fans of romance and beyond. The series follows two women named Nana, seemingly different but navigating curiously similar life situations that lead to separate outcomes.Without giving away how their stories intertwine, Nana's 47 episodes delve into the protagonists' perspectives on love through various relationships. Grounded in reality, the anime explores complex characters who, despite occasional extremes, face accountability for their actions.Your Lie in April, one of the most famous romance anime, revolves around two music prodigies: Kousei Arima and Kaori Miyazono. Kousei, grappling with depression after his mother's death, loses his passion for the piano and withdraws from the performance arts. One day, he hears Kaori playing her violin with such freedom that it reignites his love for music and sparks his admiration for her.The anime delves into themes of grief, life, love, and music. Kousei's journey toward self-healing is profound, marked by heartbreak, but also punctuated by moments of beauty, tenderness, and joy.In this anime, Miyuki and Kaguya engage in a battle of wits to avoid confessing their love first, using their intellect and skills to outmaneuver each other. Both are determined not to be seen as the one who gives in.Their antics running the student council at an elite school with their friends are uproariously funny yet also contain heartwarming moments that will make viewers cheer. Season 3 of Kaguya-sama: Love is War, which aired in Spring 2022, leaned heavily into comedy but also devoted more time to developing Miyuki and Kaguya's relationship and touching on other romances.If the anime follows the manga, the next season of Love is War promises to be predominantly romantic. If successful, this upcoming release could elevate Kaguya-sama to the pinnacle of romance anime.This anime consists of two parts: Clannad and After Story. The latter surpasses the former by a wide margin, but watching Clannad is essential to fully appreciate the impact of After Story. While it features a diverse cast of supporting characters, the heart of the show revolves around Tomoya Okazaki and Nagisa Furukawa, delivering a profound narrative.Unlike typical romance series, Clannad After Story unfolds beyond high school, depicting the growth of Tomoya and Nagisa as individuals and as a couple. The anime tackles real-life challenges without glossing over them, offering a genuine exploration of common struggles.The Dangers in My Heart is truly brilliant. At first glance, it may seem like another typical shounen romance where a popular girl falls for an ordinary loner guy. These stories often offer little beyond wish fulfilment, and The Dangers in My Heart initially appears to fit that mould. Yet, the anime stands out.Ichikawa is an average guy with few friends who daydreams about unusual things. While the anime doesn't delve deeply into these thoughts, it doesn't ignore them either, leaving Ichikawa with a poor first impression. On the other hand, Anna is a cheerful but shy girl who loves food and works as a model. After a chance encounter at the school library, the two start spending time together, developing a friendship that hints at something deeper. Anna encourages Ichikawa to break out of his shell, leading to significant changes in him over the course of two seasons.Although slow-paced initially, The Dangers in My Heart evolves into something special by the end of season 1, maintaining its momentum in the subsequent cour and establishing itself as one of the best romance anime of all time. Anna and Ichikawa are both exceptional characters, but Anna's depth is what elevates the show. She's not just an idealised plot device; she's a fully realised character with insecurities, quirks, and vulnerabilities. Her interest in Ichikawa feels genuine, and vice versa. This is a rare quality in romance anime.Fruits Basket is the definitive romance anime, masterfully blending drama and comedy. Tooru Honda, a lovable protagonist, faces life's challenges until she moves in with the Souma family. The Soumas, particularly Yuki, are school idols hiding a shocking secret that alters perceptions.Love triangles often lack depth, favouring one partner over the other. Fruits Basket defies this norm with its compelling love triangle, where each character is fully developed. Across three seasons, Fruits Basket takes viewers on an unforgettable journey.Also read | 15 best anime series of all time; here's the list","Japanese animation has delivered numerous romantic tales, ranging from light- hearted comedies to deeply emotional dramas.

The application, posing as a gaming platform, purportedly enticed users with the prospect of significant investment gains. The ED claims that the app abruptly halted its operations, leaving users unable to withdraw their funds.The Enforcement Directorate started its investigation in 2022 following the discovery of evidence indicating that some of the acquired funds were invested in digital assets.Approximately 2,500 bank accounts associated with the operation were identified, and searches led to the seizure of around Rs 19 crore.Claims suggest that the E-Nugget app, disguised as a gaming platform, assured users of significant returns on their investments. The Enforcement Directorate (ED) launched its investigation following a police report filed by the Kolkata police concerning suspected illegal activities involving Aamir Khan and his associates. They stand accused of deceiving users of the E-Nuggets app with enticing returns before abruptly terminating the scheme. In the course of the operation, the ED seized ₹2.43 crore from 66 bank accounts under the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).Aamir Khan, identified as a central figure in the alleged scam, has been arrested and is currently in custody.

"This techie is the world’s richest prisoner, with a net worth of $43 billion",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/this-techie-is-the-worlds-richest-prisoner-with-a-net-worth-of-43-billion/articleshow/109753350.cms,"How Zhao’s sentence is different from Sam Bankman-Fried

The founder and former CEO of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange , Binance , Changpeng Zhao has been sentenced to four months in prison. According to a report by Bloomberg, he has been sentenced for failing to prevent cybercriminals and terrorist groups from trading freely on Binance. Last year, Zhao even pleaded guilty to violations of US anti-money laundering and sanctions laws.With this sentence, Zhao becomes the richest person to be imprisoned (in the US and perhaps even the world), and the second major crypto boss to be sentenced to prison after FTX ’s Sam Bankman-Fried .The report suggests that, unlike Bankman-Fried, Zhao’s assets worth $43 billion will remain untouched even with the sentence. Moreover, the ongoing crypto bull run is expected to increase his net worth even more while he is jailed.In 2023, Zhao stepped down as the CEO of Binance but still retains an estimated 90% stake in the world’s largest crypto exchange. Considering that the board of directors mostly comprises his close friends, Zhao’s influence on the company is still intact, the report noted.The sentence imposed by US District Judge Richard Jones in Seattle is relatively shorter than the three years requested by the prosecutors. His sentence was also much below the maximum 1-1/2 years recommended under federal guidelines.To compare, Zhao’s sentence was also much lighter than the 25 years of captivity that was imposed on Sam Bankman-Fried in March. Bankman-Fried was accused of stealing $8 billion from customers of the FTX crypto exchange which is now bankrupt. However, Bankman-Fried has appealed his conviction and sentence.Moreover, prosecutors also seemed happy with the sentence which was the outcome of a long investigation spanning years into Binance and Zhao. The billionaire also lived in the United Arab Emirates which is beyond US reach.“This was an epic day. Incarceration was critical in this case and we’re pleased with the result,” said US Attorney Tessa Gorman , as per news agency Reuters.","Changpeng Zhao has been sentenced to four months in prison for failing to prevent cybercriminals and terrorist groups from trading freely on Binance.

Display and design: The iPhone 15 features a 6.1-inch display and was launched in pink, yellow, green, blue, and black colour options.

Camera upgrades: This model boasts a 48-megapixel primary camera sensor, offering significant improvements in daylight, low-light, and portrait photography compared to its predecessor.

Battery life: Apple claims the iPhone 15 has ""all-day battery life,"" though real-world usage suggests it can last over 9 hours with average usage.

Processor: Powered by Apple's A16 Bionic chip, an upgrade from the A15 chip used in the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus, with Pro models receiving the faster A16 chip.

Charging port: Notably, the iPhone 15 features a USB Type-C charging port, replacing the Lightning port used in previous models and aligning with the more commonly used USB Type-C standard.
