Sam Altman-led OpenAI has started rolling out its advanced voice mode to a small group of ChatGPT Plus users. Voice mode on ChatGPT was announced earlier this year in May. It enables authentic interactions with the artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot, offering real-time responses without delay and emotional engagements. The advanced voice mode was initially scheduled to release in -late June, but the company delayed it to July to “reach our bar to launch.”ChatGPT Plus is a paid subscription plan for ChatGPT.It offers priority access to new features along with faster response speed and availability even when demand is high.In a post on X (formerly known as Twitter), the company said “ We’re starting to roll out advanced Voice Mode to a small group of ChatGPT Plus users. Advanced Voice Mode offers more natural, real-time conversations, allows you to interrupt anytime, and senses and responds to your emotions.”“Users in this alpha will receive an email with instructions and a message in their mobile app. We'll continue to add more people on a rolling basis and plan for everyone on Plus to have access in the fall,” the company added.Video and screen sharing capabilities will launch at a later date, it added.The company says that it has tested GPT-4o's voice capabilities with 100+ external red teamers across 45 languages. The AI model will only speak in four preset voices – Juniper, Breeze, Cove and Ember – made in collaboration with paid voice actors.OpenAI says that it has built systems to block outputs that differ from those voices. Additionally, it has implemented guardrails to block requests for violent or copyrighted content.OpenAI spokesperson Lindsay McCallum says “ChatGPT cannot impersonate other people’s voices, both individuals and public figures, and will block outputs that differ from one of these preset voices.”","ChatGPT Plus is a paid subscription plan for ChatGPT.

Why hacker is God in the world of Cryptocurrency and Bitcoins,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-hacker-is-god-in-the-world-of-cryptocurrency-and-bitcoins/articleshow/112147329.cms,"force majeure' events or 'Act of God' -- beyond their control

Cyberattacks: The Unstoppable Force Majeure in Crypto

The recent cyberattack on WazirX has brought into sharp focus the precarious position of cryptocurrency investors. While the immediate impact is the loss of funds, a deeper analysis reveals a systemic issue: the loophole of ' force majeure '.Cryptocurrency exchanges, unlike traditional financial institutions, often classify cyberattacks as '– in their terms of service.This clause, typically buried in lengthy legal jargon, absolves exchanges from liability in case of such incidents.The WazirX fiasco has ignited a debate about the fairness of this practice. Critics argue that while cyberattacks are indeed challenging to prevent, exchanges profit from handling vast sums of digital assets and should therefore bear some responsibility for their loss.A spokesperson for WazirX defended the industry’s stance, stating that the unpredictable nature of cyber threats makes it difficult to guarantee absolute security. However, legal experts like Supreme Court advocate N S Nappinai point out that while including a wide range of events under force majeure is common practice, it should be limited to circumstances truly beyond the control of the service provider.The incident underscores the need for greater transparency and investor protection in the cryptocurrency market. As the industry matures, it is imperative to establish clear guidelines and regulations to safeguard the interests of users.“In the opaque world of crypto, contract is king. The terms are invariably captured in standard form contracts and not negotiated. Including a wide array of circumstances in a force majeure is standard practice, but the same is ring fenced by those circumstances that are beyond the control of the offeror,” Supreme Court senior advocate N S Nappinai told ET.","Cryptocurrency exchanges often classify cyberattacks as '– in their terms of service.

A series of coordinated attacks on France's critical infrastructure has continued with the cutting of multiple fiber optic cables across the country overnight. While the incident did not disrupt broadband services in Paris or impact the ongoing Olympic Games, it marks the second such attack in as many days. The vandalism came after arson attacks hit train networks around France on Friday, hours before the Olympics opening ceremony.Telecommunications providers, including SFR , Iliad's Free, and Netalis, reported widespread damage to their networks in nine regions. Although service has been restored through backup systems, internet speeds have slowed in some areas. Cloud provider OVHcloud has also been affected, with slower connections between Europe and Asia Pacific.The French Telecom Federation has called for stricter penalties for vandalism of telecom infrastructure, citing the increasing frequency and scale of these attacks. Authorities are investigating the incident and have not ruled out a connection to the recent sabotage of French rail lines. News agency AFP confirmed with major carriers including Free and SFR that they had been affected.""It's vandalism,"" said Nicolas Chatin, spokesman for SFR, one of France's four biggest operators. ""Large sections of cables were cut. You would have to use an axe or a grinder,"" he told AFP.A source close to the case told AFP nobody had yet said they were responsible for the telecoms sabotage. ""What frankly makes us furious is that we feel the state has not realised the importance of these potential attacks on France's strategic infrastructures,"" said Nicolas Guillaume of Netalis, a specialised operator.As France remains on high alert due to the Olympic Games, security forces have been deployed in large numbers to protect key infrastructure and public spaces. The country is grappling with a growing threat to its critical networks, raising concerns about national security and resilience.","Telecommunications providers report widespread damage to their networks in nine regions.

Google-parent company Alphabet is being subjected to scrutiny by the UK’s antitrust watchdog over its partnership with artificial intelligence startup Anthropic and its impact on competition. Britain's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has invited comments on the transaction from any interested party, in advance of the CMA ’s formal investigation starting.“The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is considering whether it is or may be the case that Alphabet’s partnership with Anthropic has resulted in the creation of a relevant merger situation under the merger provisions of the Enterprise Act 2002 and, if so, whether the creation of that situation may be expected to result in a substantial lessening of competition within any market or markets in the United Kingdom for goods or services,” the regulator said in a statement on Tuesday (July 30).The CMA has set a deadline of August 13 for its invitation to comment. After that, it will decide whether to launch an official investigation at the end of this process.Anthropic, which was co-founded by former OpenAI executives, last year said it had secured $500 million in investment from Alphabet, promising another $1.5 billion over time.

Anand Mahindra said that artificial intelligence (AI) can be of more value to mankind than ‘imagined’. Citing a research that showed how AI can detect breast cancer five years before it develops, he wrote ""If this is accurate, then AI is going to be of significantly more value to us than we imagined and much earlier than we had imagined,"".The Mahindra Group chairman took to microblogging platform X (formerly known as Twitter) to share his views.Recently, a team of researchers from Duke University in the US developed a new AI model to predict 5-year breast cancer risk from mammograms.Traditional cancer diagnosis relies on biopsies, microscopic histological examinations, and imaging techniques like MRI, CT, and PET scans. Human interpretation of these tests can be subjective. AI, on the other hand, can analyse medical images with staggering accuracy.An IANS report quotes Vineet Nakra, a radiation oncologist at Max Super Speciality Hospital on how AI is helping in cancer diagnosis and treatment. She told the news agency that AI is helping pathologists diagnose cancer much faster and paving the way for doctors to make personalised and patient-centric cancer care.Commenting on Mahindra’s X post, a user wrote “That's the best use of technology anyway. Assisting human kind to become better and reduce risks”. “AI in the medical field will have a huge impact and will certainly make significant contributions.

He made this statement in response to a question raised in the Rajya Sabha recently.“[The] Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) has shared that WhatsApp or Meta has not informed the government about any such plans,” Vaishnaw said in a written reply to a question by Congress member Vivek Tankha, as per PTI report on Friday (July 26).Tankha had asked whether WhatsApp was planning to shut its services in India due to the government's directives to share user details in accordance with the government directions under Section 69A of the Information Technology Act, 2000.Responding to Tankha's question on curbs on social media platforms, the I&B minister said the central government issued directions in the interest of the sovereignty or integrity of India, defence of India, security of the state, friendly relations with foreign states or public order or for preventing incitement to the commission of any cognisable offence relating to above in respect of the information on a computer resource.Earlier this year, WhatsApp told the Delhi High Court that it will stop functioning in India if it is compelled by the government to break encryption of messages.Previously, WhatsApp challenged the newly amended IT Rules saying that they violate the right to privacy and were unconstitutional. WhatsApp told the Delhi High Court that its end-to-end encryption protects user privacy by ensuring only the sender and recipient can access message content.“As a platform, we are saying, if we are told to break encryption, then WhatsApp goes,” Tejas Karia, appearing for Whatsapp, told a Division Bench.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has reduced the basic customs duty on mobile phones, chargers, and some components as part of the Union Budget 2024, addressing a major demand from the electronics manufacturing industry. Currently, imported smartphones sold in India are subject to 18% GST and 22% customs duty (20% basic and 2% surcharge). The 10% surcharge on the basic customs duty will remain unchanged.Following the reduction, the total customs duty is now 16.5% (15% basic and 1.5% surcharge). For phones manufactured in India, only the 18% GST is applied. Apple imports its iPhone Pro and Pro Max models, while its other smartphones are produced locally.Post this announcement, Apple has reduced prices of iPhones in India. While the price cut on base models non-Pro is almost negligible at Rs 300, the cut on high end Pro models is up to Rs 6,000. Here are the new prices of iPhones as they appear on Apple's official store in India.Apple has already updated its website with the new prices of the iPhone. The iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max models have received a discount of up to Rs 6,000.

CrowdStrike outage: Microsoft now wants to keep away the access of Windows Kernel from these companies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/crowdstrike-outage-microsoft-now-wants-to-keep-away-the-access-of-windows-kernel-from-these-companies/articleshow/112057428.cms,"Following a major outage caused by a faulty CrowdStrike update last week, Microsoft is pushing for significant changes to Windows security architecture. The incident, which impacted 8.5 million PCs, has led Microsoft to reassess the resilience of its operating system and consider restricting kernel-level access for third-party security vendors .John Cable, Microsoft's vice president of program management for Windows servicing and delivery, outlined the company's stance in a blog post titled ""Windows resiliency: Best practices and the path forward."" Cable emphasised the need for ""end-to-end resilience"" and hinted at potential changes that could restrict kernel access for security software.The CrowdStrike update bug, which resulted in widespread system crashes, has highlighted the risks associated with allowing third-party applications to operate at the kernel level. This privileged access, while beneficial for threat detection, can lead to catastrophic failures if errors occur.Microsoft is now exploring alternatives that don't rely on kernel access, such as VBS enclaves and the Azure Attestation service. These technologies, which utilize Zero Trust approaches, could provide enhanced security without the risks associated with kernel-level operations.The tech giant's push for change may face resistance from cybersecurity vendors and regulators. A similar attempt to restrict kernel access in Windows Vista in 2006 was met with opposition. In contrast, Apple successfully locked down kernel access in macOS in 2020.Microsoft's approach involves collaboration with partners and the broader security community. The company aims to balance improved system resilience with the needs of security vendors who have historically relied on kernel-level access for their products.Microsoft's response to the CrowdStrike incident also included deploying over 5,000 support engineers to assist affected organizations and providing ongoing updates through the Windows release health dashboard. The company has emphasized the importance of business continuity planning, secure data backups, and utilizing cloud-native approaches for managing Windows devices to enhance resilience against future incidents.","Microsoft is pushing for changes to its Windows security architecture.

SearchGPT in testing phase right now

What OpenAI said about SearchGPT

OpenAI to take on Microsoft Bing and Perplexity, along with Google

SearchGPT may look like Google Overview

(With agency inputs)

OpenAI is testing an artificial intelligence-powered search engine that can access information from across the internet in real time. The prominent AI startup revealed the new prototype, SearchGPT , in a blog post earlier this week. OpenAI plans to integrate its new search engine technology with its existing online chatbot, ChatGPT. In a blog post, Microsoft-backed OpenAI said that the company plans to integrate the best features from the search tool into ChatGPT in the future.Here are the key things to know about SearchGPT.The company said it was testing the technology with a small group of users as well as online publishers who partnered with OpenAI to help build the search engine.“Getting answers on the web can take a lot of effort, often requiring multiple attempts to get relevant results,” the company said in its blog post. “We believe that by enhancing the conversational capabilities of our models with real-time information from the web, finding what you’re looking for can be faster and easier,” it added. Users will be able to interact with SearchGPT through conversational queries, and can ask follow-up questions as they might if speaking to a person, OpenAI said.Other than the search giant Google , SearchGPT launch, announced earlier this week, places the AI giant in competition with its largest backer Microsoft's Bing search and emerging services such as Perplexity — a search-focused AI chatbot firm backed by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and semiconductor giant Nvidia . According to web analytics firm Statcounter, Google dominates the search engine market with a 91.1% share as of June 2024.Google recently added AI-generated query result summaries -- referred to as ""Overviews"" -- to its search engine. This new feature offers written text at the top of results for Google searches, ahead of the traditional links to websites, which summarizes information that the engine believes answers the user's search query. The description shared by OPenAI of SearchGPT appears similar to Google's Overviews.","OpenAI is testing an artificial intelligence-powered search engine that can access information from across the internet in real time.

How X’s auto-consent flouts tech rules in the UK, EU

Elon Musk-owned X recently enabled by default a setting that allows the social media platform to utilise user data to train its AI model, Grok. This means X can use user posts, interactions, and outputs from Grok for training and refining its AI, requiring users to manually opt-out. Now the regulators in the UK and the European Union ( EU ) have reportedly connected with the company over its alleged attempt to gain user consent for data harvesting without their approval.While X claims this data is essential for improving user experience, privacy concerns have been raised. The setting states that users “allow your posts as well as your interactions, inputs and results with Grok to be used for training and fine-tuning”.Users have expressed difficulty in disabling this feature as the option is currently hidden within the web app's settings and unavailable on the mobile app.The move contradicts the tech laws in both the regions as the regulations prohibit pre-ticked consent boxes. Tech companies are not allowed to use “pre-ticked boxes” or “any other method of default consent”.Data protection authorities in the UK and Ireland have expressed their concerns over X's actions, as per a report by the Guardian. The UK's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) is investigating the matter, emphasising the importance of transparency and user choice in data usage.“Platforms seeking to use their users’ data to train their AI foundation models must be transparent about their activities,” said a spokesperson for the ICO.“They should take steps to proactively notify users well in advance of using data for these purposes, and provide people with ample time and simple processes to object to having their data used in this way,” the spokesperson added.Similarly, Ireland's Data Protection Commission (DPC), the lead regulator for X in the EU, has expressed surprise at the development and is seeking further information from the company.“The DPC has been engaging with X on this matter for a number of months, with our latest interaction occurring as recently as yesterday, therefore we are surprised by today’s developments. We have followed up with X today (July 26) and are awaiting a response. We expect further engagement early next week,” said Graham Doyle, a DPC deputy commissioner.","X recently enabled by default a setting that allows the social media platform to utilise user data to train its AI model, Grok.

Karnataka reservation bill: PhonePe CEO and founder Sameer Nigam issues this 'personal statement',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/karnataka-reservation-bill-phonepe-ceo-and-founder-sameer-nigam-issues-this-personal-statement/articleshow/111908948.cms,"Read PhonePe CEO Sameer Nigam’s personal note

“PhonePe was born in Bengaluru and we are incredibly proud of our roots in this city, which is well known for its world-class technology talent and vibrant diversity. From Bengaluru, over the past decade we have expanded across the length and breadth of India and been able to deliver secure and efficient digital payments for over 55 Crore Indians.

Bengaluru's reputation as the ""Silicon valley of India"" is truly well-deserved. The city thrives on an incredible culture of innovation, and attracts the most brilliant young minds from Karnataka and the rest of India. As a company, we are deeply grateful for the supportive business environment that Karnataka’s governments and its local

Kannadiga

populace have offered us. Without such an inclusive ecosystem and progressive policies, Bengaluru would not have become a global technology superpower.

As a company we also thrive on celebrating diversity, we have always tried hard to deliver fair, unbiased and meritocracy-based employment opportunities for all Indians - including to all local Kannadigas. We believe such an approach gives every Indian a good job a chance to shine, and ultimately helps create more societal and economic value for Bengaluru, Karnataka and India.

I read some recent media articles, relating to a few personal comments that I made last week regarding the draft job reservation bill. I would first and foremost like to clarify that it was NEVER my intention to insult Karnataka and it’s people. If my comments hurt anyone’s sentiments in such a way, I am truly sorry and would like to offer you an unconditional apology. I have the highest regard for Kannada, and all other Indian languages. In fact, I truly believe that linguistic diversity and rich cultural heritage is a national asset that all Indians should be proud of; and all Indians should be respectful of and celebrate local and cultural norms.

Bengaluru’s Indian startups are competing against trillion dollar giants like Google, Apple, Amazon and Microsoft. To do so, these companies must be able to employ the very best talent available in India purely based on their technology skills and proficiency in fields such as Coding, Design, Product Management, Data Sciences, Machine Learning, AI and beyond. As a nation, that is the only way we can build world-class companies that can compete in the global village that we live in today.

I also want to help create lakhs of jobs for Bengaluru and Karnataka. And, I believe with more dialogue and discussion, we can find ways to create more sustainable employment avenues. Let’s all work together to do this meaningfully and while creating long-term impact.”

PhonePe CEO Sameer Nigam issued a personal note following backlash over his comments on Karnataka 's job reservation bill. The controversy erupted after Nigam criticised the bill on social media platform X, questioning whether his children deserved jobs in their home city given his company's pan-India job creation.""If my comments hurt anyone's sentiments, I am truly sorry and would like to offer you an unconditional apology,"" Nigam said in a statement.He emphasised his 22-year connection to Bengaluru and respect for linguistic diversity.The Karnataka Cabinet had recently approved a bill mandating 50% reservation for locals in management roles and 70% in non-management positions within private companies. The bill, which also proposed 100% quota for locals in certain government jobs, was put on hold after industry backlash.Nigam stressed the need for merit-based hiring to build globally competitive companies. He reaffirmed PhonePe's commitment to Karnataka, stating the company plans to create thousands of new jobs in the state.",PhonePe CEO Sameer Nigam issued a personal note following backlash over his comments on Karnataka's job reservation bill.
