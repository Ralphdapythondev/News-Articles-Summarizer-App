Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff clearly isn't impressed with Microsoft Copilot. This can be said on the basis of the executive’s latest post on X in which he compared the AI-powered chatbot and interface with the discontinued intelligent user interface for Microsoft Office Clippy .“When you look at how Copilot has been delivered to customers, it’s disappointing. It just doesn’t work, and it doesn’t deliver any level of accuracy.Gartner says it’s spilling data everywhere, and customers are left cleaning up the mess,” Benioff said in a post on X.“To add insult to injury, customers are then told to build their own custom LLMs. I have yet to find anyone who’s had a transformational experience with Microsoft Copilot or the pursuit of training and retraining custom LLMs. Copilot is more like Clippy 2.0,” he added.Benioff’s post has reference from a report by Gartner, which highlighted potential security risks associated with Microsoft Copilot . The report, based on a survey of 132 IT leaders, found that concerns about data oversharing and security are causing many organisations to delay their Copilot deployments.While Gartner acknowledges that Copilot generally adheres to security protocols and user permissions, it warns that improper configuration or overly permissive access controls could lead to unintentional data exposure.“M365 Copilot honors user permissions. It also respects data security controls, such as sensitivity labels, where these have been correctly applied. However, if controls have not been correctly applied or permissions are too open, M365 Copilot can increase the risk of oversharing by retrieving, summarising and generating content that the user should not have access to. It could also surface content that should no longer exist,” said the August report titled “Copilot for Microsoft 365: Assessing the Impact and Value So Far.”Incidentally, this is the second time in a month that he has compared Copilot with the Office Assistant, with the first instance being at the Dreamforce conference in mid-September.Benioff dismissed competition posed by Microsoft and said “that Microsoft Copilot is basically the new Microsoft Clippy, that customers have not gotten value from it.”It’s “like we’re selling science projects to companies, and they’re tired of it. They’ve not gotten the value” from the technology, he added.","Gartner says it’s spilling data everywhere, and customers are left cleaning up the mess. “To add insult to injury, customers are then told to build their own custom LLMs. Copilot is more like Clippy 2.0,” he added.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114327062,imgsize-61443,width-400,resizemode-4/114327062.jpg"

Worst rated founder

Here are some of the user comments from poll

A recent poll conducted by the 'Startup India' community on Reddit has sparked discussion around leadership qualities in the Indian startup ecosystem . The poll, which saw participation from a significant number of users, revealed the community's picks for the ""Best"" and ""Worst"" Indian startup founders.Sridhar Vembu , the CEO of Zoho , emerged as the clear winner for ""Best Founder."" Users lauded Vembu for his contributions to job creation, his commitment to building a successful product, and his impressive business acumen.Zoho, a multinational software company, is known for its diverse range of products and services, making it a major player in the global tech landscape.Byju Raveendran , the CEO of edtech giant Byju's , received the dubious honour of being voted the ""Worst Founder."" Redditors criticised Raveendran for fostering a toxic work culture, misleading marketing practices, and questionable financial decisions. The company has also defaulted on large debt obligations in both the United States and India, leading to bankruptcy proceedings. These difficulties have resulted in large-scale layoffs, unpaid salaries, and a sharp decline in the company's valuation.“Its a tough contest between Byju Raveendran, Bhavesh Agarwal, and Rahul Yadav. Life rarely gives you second chances, especially after royal screw-ups. He somehow found a way to sabotage that too.”“Byju has to take this one. Its hard to piss off investors, customers, lawmakers across geographies and employees to the degree what he has managed to do”“Byjus Ravindran He is greedy and followed stupid practices to sell his product. ( Many parents stuck in debt and cried ). He put so much pressure on his employees and treated worst. He picked a fight with investors instead of being supportive who supported him in initial stages. He brought bad name to Indian startup system. He is WORST because he brought worst experience to customers, employees, Investors, Vendors and to country. Atleast others didn't disappoint atleast one stakeholder but he disappointed every stakeholder associated witht the company.”“It may be Byju.. he screwed everyone whom he hired. Probably misguided by Investors .. The thing is he spoiled indian startup reputation abroad.Whatever u say about Bhavesh he has started multiple billion dollar firms... and he needs a good PR agency but he is not bad .. there are handful of founders who could execute at his scale in 1.4 billion population”","A recent poll conducted by the 'Startup India' community on Reddit has sparked discussion around leadership qualities in the Indian startup ecosystem.

Back to India plans

Offered to repay entire loan

Byju’s founder Byju Raveendran held a virtual media briefing where he talked about a range of issues including the biggest setback for India's erstwhile biggest startup, dispute with BCCI , fund raising, why he has left India and staying in Dubai and more.In the candid media call that lasted over two hours, Raveendran said that Byju’s worth today is Zero.Investors like Prosus have written off their investment in the once-the-most-valued Indian startup. He said that the biggest setback for the company was when three of Byju’s key investors -— Prosus, Peak XV Partners and Chan Zuckerberg Initiative -- resigned from the board at the same time in 2023, making it impossible for the company to raise funds.Responding to questions about his return to India, Raveendran, who lives in Dubai, said that he plans to come back to India and fill stadiums again. However, for now, his hands are tied on India operations till litigations are underway.Raveendran said that he has pledged to repay the company's outstanding debts to lenders if they are willing to cooperate. In the call, Raveendran expressed frustration with the aggressive tactics employed by some lenders, which have escalated the company's financial troubles.Raveendran emphasized that the ongoing insolvency proceedings against BYJU'S would result in no benefit for the lenders if they continue their current course of action. He offered to repay the entire loan amount before taking any personal funds, stating that the company was unable to do so earlier due to the lenders' demands for immediate repayment of the entire USD 1.2 billion loan.","Byju’s founder Byju Raveendran held a virtual media briefing where he talked about a range of issues including the biggest setback for India's erstwhile biggest startup, dispute with BCCI, fund raising, why he has left India and staying in Dubai and more.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai announces big change to the company's leadership; read his memo to Googlers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-ceo-sundar-pichai-announces-big-change-to-the-companys-leadership-read-his-memo-to-googlers/articleshow/114325939.cms,"long-time search head

Prabhakar Raghavan

will transition to the role of Chief Technologist

Google has appointed Nick Fox, a seasoned leader within the company's search and ads division

Here's the memo Google CEO Sundar Pichai sent to Google employees:

Hi Googlers,

It's been an exciting few days for AI across our products. We saw NotebookLM with Audio Overviews go viral, added more ways to find information in Search and Lens, and launched a revamped Google Shopping for the AI era. We also just shared a big milestone in our work to help doctors use AI to detect diabetic retinopathy: 600,000 screenings and counting, and we’re expanding access to more people across India and Thailand. There’s a lot more to come.

AI moves faster than any technology before it. To keep increasing the pace of progress, we've been making shifts to simplify our structures along the way, including the creation of Google DeepMind and the joining of the Platforms & Devices teams. As a next step, Prabhakar and I have been thinking through how to structure our Knowledge & Information team for the Gemini era, and today we shared the following changes:

The Gemini app team led by Sissie will join Google DeepMind under Demis. As the name suggests, the Gemini app is the direct consumer interface to the latest and greatest Gemini models. Bringing the teams closer together will improve feedback loops, enable fast deployment of our new models in the Gemini app, make our post-training work proceed more efficiently and build on our great product momentum.

The Assistant teams focused on devices and home experiences will move to Platforms & Devices so they can sit closer to the product surfaces they’re building for and bring our AI-powered home initiatives into one team and focus on improving user experience.

In parallel to this, Prabhakar has decided it’s time to make a big leap in his own career. After 12 years leading teams across Google, he’ll return to his computer science roots and take on the role of Chief Technologist, Google. In this role, he’ll partner closely with me and Google leads to provide technical direction and leadership and grow our culture of tech excellence. Nick Fox, a longtime Googler and member of Prabhakar’s leadership team, will be stepping up to lead K&I, which includes our Search, Ads, Geo, and Commerce products.

Prabhakar's leadership journey at Google has been remarkable, spanning Research, Workspace, Ads, and K&I. He led the

team in launching Smart Reply and Smart Compose as early examples of using AI to improve products, and took Gmail and Drive past 1 billion users. Across K&I, Prabhakar and team have achieved significant growth and innovation: from launching AI Overviews, a groundbreaking advancement in Search that benefits hundreds of millions of users worldwide to introducing new search modalities like Circle to Search, video understanding, and ""shop what you see"" in Lens — all while improving core Search functionality. Maps and Shopping have transformed with AI-driven features like immersive view and virtual try-on. And in Ads, we’ve made real progress with AI-powered ad formats and streamlined campaign management, while continuing to innovate with Performance Max to empower millions of businesses.

I’m so grateful to Prabhakar for the strong foundation and leadership bench he’s built across K&I. That includes his incredible senior leaders and Nick who is ready to hit the ground running in his new role as SVP of K&I!

Over the past few years, Nick has been instrumental in shaping Google's AI product roadmap and collaborating closely with Prabhakar and his leadership team on K&I's strategy. And throughout his career, Nick has demonstrated leadership across nearly every facet of K&I, from Product and Design in Search and Assistant, to our Shopping, Travel, and Payments products. He was also a pioneering leader in Ads, where he helped establish a rigorous quality and user-focused approach that remains key to our success. Nick has launched innovative consumer products like Google Fi and spearheaded complex initiatives such as RCS messaging. I frequently turn to Nick to tackle our most challenging product questions and he consistently delivers progress with tenacity, speed, and optimism.

Congratulations to Nick, and a heartfelt thank you to Prabhakar for his leadership through numerous technology shifts and for building a strong foundation for the future.

Jio and Airtel wanted spectrum auction

Telecom Minister clarifies

Starlink CEO and X (previously Twitter) owner Elon Musk posted that Starlink ‘will do our best to serve the people of India’. Musk was responding to the announcement made by union telecom minister Jyotiradtiya Scindia that satcomm spectrum will be allocated administratively and not auctioned. “BREAKING: India’s government said it will allot spectrum for satellite broadband administratively and not via auction, hours after Elon Musk criticized the auction route being sought by billionaire Mukesh Ambani Good News for Starlink,” X user DogeDesinger wrote in a post.Replying to the post, Musk wrote “Much appreciated! We will do our best to serve the people of India with Starlink.”Earlier this week, both Jio and Airtel called for a revised approach to spectrum allocation for satellite communication companies in India. In a letter to the telecom minister, Jio emphasised that satellite companies should acquire spectrum through a transparent auction process, similar to traditional telecom players. Speaking at IMC 2024, Bharti Airtel Chairman Sunil Mittal favoured bidding for such allocation.Musk then termed their demand as ‘unprecedented’.Telecom Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia said on Tuesday that such airwaves will be given out through administrative allocation and not auctioned. ""Satellite spectrum across the world is allocated administratively. So, India is not doing anything different from the rest of the world. Conversely, if you do decide to auction it then you would be doing something, which is different from the rest of the world,"" the minister said.""That does not mean that spectrum does not come without a cost. What that cost is and what the formula of that cost is going to be, will not be decided by you or me ...it will be decided by Trai...and there is a paper that has already been circulated by Trai, and we have a regulatory authority for telecom, and that regulatory authority of telecom has been empowered by the constitution to decide what that administrative pricing is going to be,"" he said.","Telecom Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia said on Tuesday that such airwaves will be given out through administrative allocation and not auctioned.

Here’s RBI’s full statement

The Reserve Bank of India has today, in exercise of its powers under Section 45L(1)(b) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, issued Directions to the following NBFCs to cease and desist from sanction and disbursal of loans, effective from close of business of October 21, 2024.

These Directions have been conveyed today to the concerned NBFCs through the Reserve Bank’s detailed supervisory orders. This action is based on material supervisory concerns observed in the Pricing Policy of these companies in terms of their Weighted Average Lending Rate (WALR) and the Interest Spread charged over their cost of funds, which are found to be excessive and not in adherence with the regulations as laid down in the Master Direction – Reserve Bank of India (Regulatory Framework for Microfinance Loans) Directions, 2022 dated March 14, 2022 (updated as on July 25, 2022) and Master Direction – Reserve Bank of India (Non-Banking Financial Company–Scale Based Regulation) Directions, 2023, dated October 19, 2023 (updated as on March 21,2024).

These are also found to be not in conformity with the provisions laid down under Fair Practices Code issued by the Reserve Bank.

Over the last few months, the Reserve Bank has been sensitising its Regulated Entities through various channels on the need to use their regulatory freedom responsibly and ensure fair, reasonable and transparent pricing, especially for small value loans. However, unfair and usurious practices continued to be seen during the course of onsite examinations as well as from the data collected and analysed offsite.

In addition to usurious pricing, these NBFCs were variously found to be in nonadherence with the regulatory guidelines on assessment of household income and consideration of existing / proposed monthly repayment obligations in respect of their microfinance loans. Deviations were also observed in respect of Income Recognition & Asset Classification (IR&AC) norms resulting in evergreening of loans, conduct of gold loan portfolio, mandated disclosure requirements on interest rates and fees, outsourcing of core financial services, etc.

These business restrictions have been made effective from the close of business on October 21, 2024 to facilitate closure of transactions in the pipeline, if any. These business restrictions do not preclude these companies from servicing their existing customers and carrying out collection and recovery processes in accordance with the extant regulatory guidelines.

These business restrictions will be reviewed upon receipt of confirmation from the companies regarding suitable remedial action having been taken to adhere to the regulatory guidelines at all times, more particularly their pricing policy, risk management processes, customer service and grievance redressal aspects, to the satisfaction of the Reserve Bank.

The Reserve Bank of India RBI ) has banned four non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) to cease and desist from sanction and disbursal of loans, effective October 21, 2024. The NBFCs include Asirvad Micro Finance, Arohan Financial Services, DMI Finance Private and Flipkart founder Sachin Bansal ’s Navi Finserv .In a statement, the central bank said that the “action is based on material supervisory concerns observed in the Pricing Policy of these companies in terms of their Weighted Average Lending Rate (WALR) and the Interest Spread charged over their cost of funds, which are found to be excessive and not in adherence with the regulations”.In its statement, the bank clarified that these business restrictions do not prevent the companies from servicing their existing customers or conducting collection and recovery processes in compliance with the current regulatory guidelines.""Navi Finserv Limited is committed to conducting its business operations with the highest standards of compliance, customer service, and transparency. The company is reviewing the directions received from the Hon’ble Reserve Bank of India and will work with them, and address all the concerns raised with promptness and completeness,"" said Navi Finserv in an official statement.","The Reserve Bank of India has banned four non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) to cease and desist from sanction and disbursal of loans, effective October 21, 2024.

""When it comes to the in-home experience itself, now we have a great product called Jio TV+, which was a unified experience to discover all of the OTT services that are available, especially on the Jio STB, so that from a single interface, users can discover and consume all their favourite shows and movies and so on, without having to search and jump across multiple apps and so on.

So, this particular service, which was till now on the Jio STB and a very well-loved offering, we have now also enabled that to be available on other smart TV platforms. So, what that means is that if you are a JioFiber or Jio AirFiber customer, then the same Jio TV+ application that is available on the STB is now also available for additional televisions that you may have in your home without requiring an additional STB or an additional connection. So, it just becomes an additional app that you can download on your smart TV without having to take additional efforts to enable that to happen.""","JioTV+ was a unified experience to discover all of the OTT services that are available, especially on the Jio STB.

What is significance of this Apple-Google partnership

The US Department of Justice is ""very likely"" to prohibit Google 's long-standing search deal with Apple , according to Jefferies analysts. This decision could mark an end to the 22-year-long partnership, which has been in place since 2002 and is still continuing.The $25 billion agreement, which makes Google the default search engine on iPhones , is estimated to account for 20% of Apple's pretax profit and 6.3% of its total revenue.Jefferies analysts predict the ban could result in an 8% to 11% decline in Apple's share prices.At the centre of the largest antitrust trial in decades, Google's practice of paying billions annually to secure prominent placement on devices has come under scrutiny. The DOJ argues that these deals stifle competition and innovation, while Google maintains that its dominance stems from consumer preference.Despite the potential setback, the full impact may not be immediate. Jefferies estimates a final court outcome could take three to eight years, including appeals. This timeline could allow Apple to develop alternative strategies, such as exploring its own search engine or deepening AI integrations.The case's outcome could have far-reaching implications for the tech industry. It may force Apple to reconsider its search strategy and potentially open doors for competitors like Microsoft . The decision could also fundamentally alter Google's ability to maintain its search engine market dominance through financial agreements.",Jefferies analysts predict the ban could result in an 8% to 11% decline in Apple's share prices.

“Minister @dpradhanbjp nothing in Bengaluru, the technology capital of India? Why are you and @AshwiniVaishnaw ignoring the South in IT, ignoring Bengaluru? Are we not part of Bharat too? Bengaluru voted for

but all we get is stepmotherly treatment. Citizens here are very angry and upset at you folks repeatedly ignoring us in the South! Are we children of a lesser God here? We need our PM @narendramodi @PMOIndia to intervene, give us our share too. @Tejasvi_Surya @PCMohanMP @hd_kumaraswamy @nsitharaman @what are our MP’s doing? For voting NDA our state govt too is ignoring us! Not investing enough in Bengaluru!”

“I want to respond to this because I was the Co-chair of the apex committee that decided the 3 AI Centres of Excellence.

The committee itself had plenty of us from the South (probably the majority). Most of us came from the private sector and the Government did not tell us who we should select. We in the committee (again with so many of us from the South and so many from the private sector) did the selection based on a very thorough evaluation of actual projects done.

The responsibility for this decision on the AI Centres of Excellence should be with us in the committee and personally with me as Co-chair and I beg people to not inject North-South politics in this 🙏

'Criminal abuse' of Iceland's privacy laws

Growing demands for a complete ban

he Icelandic Phallological Museum , housed in a modern building near the harbor, is renowned for its unique collection of mammal penises. However, to those familiar with the darker corners of the internet, the museum's address, Kalkofnsvegur 2, holds a different significance. According to an exclusive report in NewYork Times, ""...the building also has a reputation as a virtual offshore haven for some of the world’s worst perpetrators of identity theft, ransomware, disinformation, fraud and other wrongdoing.""As per the NY Times report, it is also the registered address for ' Withheld for Privacy ', a company that provides domain privacy services, allowing website owners to conceal their identities.While this practice can be beneficial for protecting against harassment or spam, it has also become a tool for those engaged in illicit activities such as identity theft, ransomware, and disinformation.Iceland has emerged as a global hub for such activities, largely due to its robust privacy laws . 'Withheld for Privacy', established by Namecheap , one of the world's largest domain registrars, has shielded tens of thousands of questionable websites. """"The company — created in 2021 by Namecheap, one of the world’s largest providers of websites — has effectively shielded tens of thousands of sketchy internet sites. Even local authorities said they had tried and failed to reach the company’s representatives when problems had arisen,"" said the NewYork Times report.Researchers at Syracuse University discovered the connection between the penis museum and fraudulent political advertising targeting Donald Trump supporters. The scam involved a website that spent $1.3 million on deceptive ads, eventually shut down by Facebook.The report adds that the internet is rife with similar scams, and proxy services like Withheld for Privacy make it difficult to identify and hold perpetrators accountable. Jon Stromer-Galley, a researcher at Syracuse University, likened the situation to ""the internet version of giving me the bird.""Kalkofnsvegur 2 has been linked to various online forums and activities, including those associated with white supremacist groups, phishing scams, and Russian influence campaigns.Iceland's privacy laws, initially intended to protect individuals from authoritarian governments, have been exploited by criminals. Mordur Ingolfsson, a former Icelandic parliament member, acknowledged that the country's efforts to create a ""Switzerland of bytes"" had been misused.Both Withheld for Privacy and Namecheap have not responded to requests for comment. Valborg Steingrimsdottir, head of Iceland's Data Protection Authority, emphasized the need for legal changes to address this issue.The rise of proxy services and the opacity of the domain registration industry have raised concerns about online privacy and security. Tech companies are facing increasing pressure to take responsibility for how their products and services are used.Iceland's Data Protection Authority, along with other government agencies, is advocating for legislation to ban services like 'Withheld for Privacy' from operating in the country.","Iceland has emerged as a global hub for such activities, largely due to its robust privacy laws.

Khan said in a blog post.This rule will require sellers to provide clear information to customers about free trials and paid subscriptions. The rule aims to prevent deceptive practices related to memberships and recurring payments . It prohibits sellers from misrepresenting facts, failing to disclose terms, charging customers without consent, and not providing a simple cancellation mechanism .The latest rule is part of the FTC’s ongoing review of its 1973 Negative Option Rule . The agency said that it is upgrading the rule to “combat unfair or deceptive practices related to subscriptions, memberships, and other recurring-payment programs in an increasingly digital economy where it’s easier than ever for businesses to sign up consumers for their products and services.”FTC said that it voted to adopt a final rule with certain changes following an evaluation of public comments. The rule will most notably bring a requirement that sellers provide annual reminders to consumers of the negative option feature of their subscription, and drop a prohibition on sellers telling consumers seeking to cancel their subscription about plan modifications or reasons to keep to their existing agreement without first asking if they want to hear about them.FTC also noted that consumer complaints about negative option marketing have increased, nearly doubling from 42 per day in 2021 to over 70 per day in 2024.

What's hurting Lendingkart

Lendingkart, a prominent MSME-focused lending platform, is reportedly negotiating a significant valuation cut with its existing investor, Fullerton Financial Holdings (FFH), due to a cash crisis and challenges in the unsecured loan market. According to a report in Economic Times, "" Lendingkart is staring at a massive valuation cut amid a cash crisis that has hit the MSME-focused lending platform over the past few months due to stress in the unsecured loan market."" The ET report quotes people familiar with the development said.The company, which was valued at $350 million during its last funding round four years ago, is now seeking a new funding deal at a much lower valuation of $100 million. Fullerton, which already holds a substantial stake in Lendingkart, is considering increasing its ownership to become the majority shareholder.Despite a successful turnaround following the pandemic, Lendingkart has faced difficulties in recent months. The company's financial performance has been impacted by factors such as increased credit costs, the Reserve Bank of India 's regulations on first loss default guarantees, and a shift towards co-lending arrangements with other lenders.The co-lending model, while helping Lendingkart expand its assets under management, has also limited its revenue potential and profitability. The company's net profit has declined in recent years, and it is now seeking additional equity capital to strengthen its financial position.Investors in the fintech lending sector are becoming more cautious, favoring companies with strong track records in traditional lending and a demonstrated ability to navigate market challenges. Lendingkart's reliance on partner lenders and its recent financial performance may be hindering its ability to attract new investors.As Lendingkart faces these challenges, other fintech lenders, such as Flexiloans, Aye Finance, and Indifi, have managed to secure funding from global investors.

What's hurting ASML

ASML Holding NV, the Europe's most valuable technology company, has lost its position. The chip major has been dethroned by software giant SAP SE following a significant drop in its market capitalization. The Dutch chip-machine maker's shares plummeted after it issued a disappointing guidance update, citing delays in chip plant construction and lower-than-expected orders.The company's market capitalization has decreased by over €60 billion since Tuesday's announcement, marking one of the largest one-day value losses in European history.This decline has allowed SAP to surpass ASML in terms of market value, a position ASML has held for several years.SAP has been experiencing strong growth, fueled by increased demand for its cloud-based solutions and AI applications . The company recently announced a restructuring plan to further integrate AI into its software offerings. SAP shares have risen 52% this year as the company benefited from a surge in cloud revenue growth, in part fueled by rising demand for artificial intelligence apps.Incidentally, this is not the first time that ASML has lost its position to SAP, the last time ASML lagged behind SAP in terms of market capitalization was in the year 2020.ASML's struggles are also attributed to the potential for stricter US export controls on its business in China and the overall weakness in the semiconductor sector. Its customers, including Intel and Samsung Electronics, have been cautious about their spending amid economic uncertainty.The company's recent financial results were further impacted by a technical error that led to the premature release of its earnings report. ASML is now scheduled to hold a conference call with investors on Wednesday.As ASML grapples with these challenges, SAP's continued success and rising market value solidify its position as a leading European technology company.","ASML Holding NV, the Europe's most valuable technology company, has lost its position.

Amazon may bring this US subscription model for Prime Video to India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/amazon-may-bring-this-us-subscription-model-for-prime-video-to-india/articleshow/114287676.cms,"What the company said



Why Amazon is planning this move



Amazon Prime Video is reportedly planning to introduce advertisements for viewers in India starting next year. According to a report by Bloomberg, this move mirrors a change which the company has already implemented in the US. The report claims that Prime Video subscribers in Indian can expect to see ads interrupting their shows and movies as Amazon seeks to offset the costs of producing and acquiring content.With this move, the company is reportedly aiming to generate more revenue to drive content investments in the rapidly expanding and competitive streaming market.In a latest statement, Amazon noted that Prime Video aims to have ""meaningfully fewer"" advertisements than other streaming providers and TV channels, while increasing ""investments over a long period of time"" on its titles.The company also pointed out that there will be an ad-free option as well. However, the pricing for the same will be shared later by Amazon.However, the company has reportedly confirmed that no changes will be made to Prime Video's current price in Indian in 2024. It currently offers subscriptions for Rs 799 per year. This means users have two more months to renew their Prime Video subscription before Amazon increases the price of the plans.This move comes as Reliance and Disney has finalised a mega-merger that will control nearly half of India's streaming users, intensifying the battle for subscribers. Despite cutting back in other markets, Amazon continues to invest heavily in India, where Prime membership sign-ups have outpaced the rest of the world.The introduction of ads, which are projected to generate $5 billion in revenue this year in the US, will provide additional funding for content acquisition and production in the price-sensitive Indian market, where competitors like JioCinema offer subscriptions for as low as a penny per day.",Amazon Prime Video is reportedly planning to introduce advertisements for viewers in India starting next year.
