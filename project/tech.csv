"iPhone users will have to pay more to join a new Patreon membership, here's why",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/new-patreon-users-have-to-pay-more-as-apple-forces-app-stores-in-app-purchase-policy/articleshow/112476364.cms,"How this will affect users



Apple will be applying its 30% App Store fee to all new memberships purchased in the Patreon iOS app, in addition to anything bought in a creator’s Patreon shop.

Any creator currently on first-of-the-month or per-creation billing plans will have to switch over to subscription billing to continue earning in the iOS app because that’s the only billing type Apple’s in-app purchase system supports.

“Apple’s billing mandates mean that if you’re on a first-of-the-month or per-creation billing model, your membership will no longer be available to fans in the iOS app starting this November until you switch over to subscription billing.

As a result of Apple’s mandates and in order to make sure that you can continue getting new members in the iOS app, we've started a 16-month-long migration process to bring all creators onto subscription billing by November 2025, supported by a roadmap of new features and tools to make sure the billing model works for you, your community, and your business. To be clear, this means that first-of-the-month and per-creation billing models will be discontinued in November 2025.”

Patreon users on iPhones will soon have to pay more for their account subscriptions . Apple has asked the crowdfunding platform to switch to their iOS in-app purchase system starting in November, or risk being removed from the App Store .In December 2023, Patreon first announced Apple’s requirements for using the App Store’s in-app purchasing system and removing all other billing systems from the Patreon iOS app by November 2024.In a blog post, Patreon wrote that this change will have two major consequences for creators and users:The company also highlighted that Apple’s fee will not impact existing members who are already subscribed to a creator. It will only affect new memberships purchased in the iOS app starting in November.Patreon also noted that Apple’s fees will only apply to purchases made through the iOS app. Prices on the web and the Android app will remain unaffected. The company will also allow creators to make their fans aware so “they can better understand the implications of where they choose to make their purchases.”The company also explained to creators:",Patreon users on iPhones will soon have to pay more for their account subscriptions.

According to a report in Cryptonews, Byun Young-oh , the head of Wakon , a cryptocurrency platform, is accused of running the scheme alongside an accomplice named Yeom.Wakon, with approximately 12,000 members, offered virtual currency staking products without the required financial registration with authourities.The company, which operated has across South Korea, targeted elderly citizens. The company promised senior citizens exorbitant returns of up to 45% to 50% on Ethereum deposits. Wakon has branches throughout South Korea.The scheme unraveled in mid-2023 when investors were unable to withdraw their funds. Despite assurances from Byun, the company's collapse became evident by November when its Seoul office was shuttered.Prosecutors have charged Byun and Yeom with fraud and are investigating the extent of the scheme. While Byun has denied any wrongdoing, claiming ignorance of Ponzi schemes, authorities are working to identify additional victims and potential accomplices.In a similar incident, the US Securities and Exchange Commission charged an crypto trading company with defrauding 200,000 investors worldwide. Continuing its crypto fraud crackdown, the SEC has charged NovaTech, NovaTech, its executives, and affiliated promoters over a multi-level marketing fraud scheme that generated $650 million in digital assets.","Byun Young-oh, the head of Wakon, is accused of running the scheme alongside an accomplice named Yeom.

Former US President Donald Trump is back on X, formerly Twitter . Trump was banned from X in 2021 and unbanned two years later by its new owner Tesla CEO Elon Musk . Trump was banned for life from the social network following his role in encouraging rioters at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021. Musk reinstated Trump’s account in 2022 after running a poll asking if the ban on him should be removed.Since his account's restatement in late 2022, the former president had posted just once since then — a photo of his mugshot after being booked at a jail in Atlanta in August 2023.The US' ex-President made a re-entry on the platform just hours before his interview with Musk. Tesla CEO Musk has publicly endorsed Trump and committed funds to helping his candidacy for a second presidency.Trump shared a series of on posts X, after more than three years of virtual silence on the platform. He posted five times to his account on Monday, August 12, including several campaign messages and a promo for his interview with Musk, scheduled for 8 p.m. New York time (5.30 am on IST on August 13).Earlier today, the US State Department warned Iran of consequences over election interference after Donald Trump's campaign said a foreign adversary hacked documents. ""These latest attempts to interfere in US elections are nothing new for the Iranian regime, which, from our vantage point, has undermined democracies -- or attempted to -- for many years now,"" State Department spokesman Vedant Patel told reporters.Patel said the United States has raised concerns in the past about Iranian cyber activity. ""We continue to have a number of tools in our tool belt to hold the Iranian regime accountable, and we won't hesitate to use them,"" Patel said.","Former US President Donald Trump is back on X, formerly Twitter.

Gmail creator: Google may have lost its way when it ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/gmail-creator-google-may-have-lost-its-way-when-it-/articleshow/112475201.cms,"Google AI Overviews in Search

Paul Buchheit, the man said to be Gmail creator, seems to be not too happy with the way Google went over the last few years. According to a report in Business Insider, Buchheit appears to believe that Google may have lost its way somewhere and that is the reason it is not doing that well in the AI space. In a recent episode of the Y Combinator Startup podcast, Buchheit said that Google's AI focus shifted after reorganizing under Alphabet in 2015.Buchheit, who is also said to be behind Google's original motto, ""Don't be evil"" — said that the shift (reorganization under Alphabet) prioritized search monopoly over AI innovation, impacting Google's edge.""The founders stepped back, and CEO Sundar Pichai took the helm. That's when its focus shifted to preserving its monopoly over search,"" Buchheit said as per the report.""They have, you know, this gold mine, like search is just so valuable,"" he said. Meanwhile, ""AI is an inherently disruptive technology."" When you directly answer queries from users — similar to chatbots like OpenAI 's ChatGPT might — you disincentivize them from clicking on ads.Buchheit went on to further add that a search company has an inherent tension between profitability and giving the right answers because there's always a temptation that if you make your results worse, people will actually click on more ads.Google launched AI Overviews this year – AI-powered Search experience where users search for a query in a traditional style and Search serves an answer the way Gemini chatbot or ChatGPT provides right above the search results.However, factually incorrect answers – like telling users to put glue on pizza – led to some setbacks and the company valuation dropped by $100 million. Google responded by saying that it is still refining the experience, which is a part of Search Labs, and that the questions asked were ‘uncommon’.In a seminal 1998 paper introducing Google, Page and Brin noted that the search engine technology has been “largely a black art” and “advertising-oriented.” With Google, however, they wanted to “provide high-quality search results over a rapidly growing World Wide Web.”","Paul Buchheit, the man said to be Gmail creator, seems to be not too happy with the way Google went over the last few years.

Google has announced that it is deactivating its AdSense services for Russian users. Reportedly, the tech giant has started notifying Russia-based YouTubers, bloggers and publishers that their Adsense accounts are being deactivated. This means that their platforms can no longer be used for advertising. Google AdSense is a program that allows website and blog owners to earn money by displaying ads on their pages.These ads are provided and managed by Google. When a visitor clicks on an ad or views it for a certain amount of time, the website owner earns money.Notably, the amount earned depends on several factors, including the type of ad, the ad's position on the page, and the number of clicks or views. Google says it will cease all payments to AdSense accounts based in Russia , effective August 2024.“Due to ongoing developments in Russia, we will no longer be able to make payments to Russia-based AdSense accounts that have been able to continue monetising traffic outside of Russia. As a result, we will be deactivating these accounts effective August 2024,” a Google spokesperson said, as per news agency Reuters.The company has also sent messages to Russia-based AdSense users that it will make remaining payments this month.“Your July earnings will be disbursed around 21–26 of August, assuming you have no active payment holds and meet the minimum payment thresholds,” the message said.While Google hasn’t specified the exact reason(s) which led to the decision, slower speeds have been noted on its YouTube video hosting platform in Russia in recent weeks. Russian lawmakers have blamed the slowdown on non-upgradation of its equipment in the country since the Russia-Ukraine war.Google stopped serving ads to users in Russia in March 2022 and blocked more than 1,000 YouTube channels.","Google has announced that it is deactivating its AdSense services for Russian users.

"Reliance Jio, Airtel and Vodafone-Idea 'unhappy' with Trai's new QoS rules; say overlook ground realities",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/reliance-jio-airtel-and-vodafone-idea-unhappy-with-trais-new-qos-rules-say-overlook-ground-realities/articleshow/112268723.cms,"COAI statement

COAI’s member Telecom Service Providers (TSPs) have consistently invested in enhancing Quality of Service (QoS) through significant improvements in network infrastructure, resulting in greater stability and reliability. The industry has embraced advanced technologies and automation tools, including predictive maintenance and AI-driven analytics, to proactively address network issues. Moreover, major initiatives are underway to fiberize towers across India, which is a crucial step for the efficient deployment of 5G services.

While TRAI has tightened the QoS benchmarks over the years, the ground realities remain unchanged. TSPs still grapple with Right of Way (RoW) issues when acquiring permissions for infrastructure deployment in public and private land for the installation of cell towers and fiber-optic cables. The situation is further aggravated due to additional requirement of street furniture for the 5G networks. Moreover, interference from various sources, such as other wireless devices and electromagnetic interference, degrade signal quality and network performance. Further, illegal boosters and repeaters used by unauthorised agents, as well as the cases of theft of equipment are also external factors which, nevertheless, impact the QoS. Besides, frequent takedown of the overhead fiber by the authorities have a significant impact in QoS as well. TSPs have limited control over these external sources which adversely impact the Quality of Services.

Despite these challenges, TSPs have consistently met TRAI's QoS benchmarks. The industry expresses concern over the proposed regulations, which not only tighten benchmarks but also shift from quarterly to monthly reporting and site to cell level reporting in many cases. In fact, the QoS parameters prescribed in the new Regulations have not been introduced by any other regulator in other similar economies. These changes are expected to significantly increase the compliance as well as the cost burden on telecom operators, and without commensurate benefits for the customers.

While we are disappointed with the stringency of these new regulations, we remain committed to engaging constructively with TRAI on QoS-related matters. Our member organizations will continue to strive for excellence in service quality while advocating for regulations that recognize the practical challenges faced by our industry.

What are the new QoS rules

The telecom industry has raised concerns over stringent new quality of service (QoS) norms introduced by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India ( TRAI ). The Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), representing major telecom players -- Reliance Jio , Airtel and Vodafone-Idea -- argues that the regulations impose excessive burdens without addressing the challenges operators face on the ground.The new rules mandate stricter service quality benchmarks, increased penalties for non-compliance, and more frequent reporting requirements. Telecom operators must now compensate subscribers for outages exceeding 24 hours at the district level and face penalties of up to Rs 10 lakh for violations.However, COAI contends that these measures are impractical given ongoing hurdles such as right-of-way (RoW) issues for infrastructure deployment, interference from unauthorized devices, and theft of equipment. The industry body also highlights the impact of frequent fiber cuts and the additional demands of 5G network rollout. Despite these challenges, telecom operators have consistently met Trai's QoS benchmarks , according to COAI. The industry is seeking a more realistic approach that acknowledges the operational difficulties and avoids placing undue financial pressure on operators.Trai has issued new quality of service (QoS) rules, making it mandatory for telecom operators to compensate subscribers in case of service outages for more than 24 hours at a district level. Trai has also increased the penal amount to Rs 1 lakh from Rs 50,000 for failing to meet each quality benchmark under the new rules.The telecom regulator has introduced a graded penalty system of Rs 1 lakh, Rs 2 lakh, Rs 5 lakh and Rs 10 lakh for different scales of rule violations and submitting false report under revised regulations -- ""The Standards of Quality of Service of Access (Wirelines and Wireless) and Broadband (Wireline and Wireless) Service Regulations, 2024"".Trai has provided a six-month grace period for operators to align their systems with the new regulations.","The Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), representing major telecom players -- Reliance Jio, Airtel and Vodafone-Idea -- argues that the regulations impose excessive burdens.

How to identify Amazon OTP scam

Meanwhile, if you are a victim of cybercrime, register your complaint with the National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal at https://cybercrime.gov.in/ or call 1930.

Amazon Great Freedom Festival sale is here and as shoppers flock to the e-commerce platform for shopping, scammers are also gearing up to capitalise on the increased online activity. One common tactic employed by fraudsters is the OTP scam. Numerous individuals have fallen victim to this scheme in the past, prompting Amazon to issue warnings to its customers.Since people usually spend thousands of their hard-earned money, it becomes crucial to remain vigilant and protect personal information during this sale period, especially from scammers requesting sign-in OTP via phone calls.In a communication shared with customers recently, Amazon said that scammers are adopting multiple tactics to defraud unsuspecting shoppers. A growing number of individuals have reported receiving phone calls from individuals posing as Amazon customer service representatives or delivery agents. These scammers aim to steal personal information, including login credentials, by manipulating victims into revealing sensitive data.Scammers often try to create a sense of urgency, stating that there has been an unexpected order or delivery which may not have been placed by a potential victim. The scammers will then ask for a sign-in One-Time Password (OTP) to cancel the delivery.A confused ‘customer’ then shares the OTP thinking that he/ she has averted the hassle of package delivery, however in reality, the scammer has gained access to the account. Shoppers must note that Amazon will never ask its customers to share their account sign-in OTP or passcode, especially over the phone to avoid being scammed.“If you receive communication — a call, text, or email — that you think may not be from Amazon, please report it to us at, amazon.in/reportascam,” it said.Last year, Amazon India and the Uttar Pradesh Police joined hands to fight fraud and protect online shoppers from bad actors. They launched a consumer education and awareness campaign named #MissionGraHAQ.","Amazon Great Freedom Festival sale is here and as shoppers flock to the e-commerce platform for shopping, scammers are gearing up to capitalise on the increased online activity.

Delta Airlines seeks compensation for disruption

In mounting problems for CrowdStrike over Microsoft outage last month, the cybersecurity company being sued by air travellers in a latest move. According to a Reuters report, air travellers whose flights were delayed or cancelled on July 19 due to Microsoft Windows outage on July 19 have filed a class action against the company.The plaintiffs include three fliers who filed the lawsuit in the federal court, Austin, Texas.They blame CrowdStrike's negligence in testing and deploying its software for the outage. Adding further, they stated that as fliers scrambled to get to their destinations, many spent hundreds of dollars on lodging, meals and alternative travel, while others missed work or suffered health problems from having to sleep on the airport floor.The filers demand CrowdStrike to pay compensatory and punitive damages to anyone whose flight was disrupted.In a statement, CrowdStrike said ""We believe this case lacks merit and we will vigorously defend the company."" The US cybersecurity company also provided an identical statement in response to a shareholder lawsuit filed on July 31.Delta claims that it faced over 2,200 flight cancellations on July 19 alone, with more than 6,000 flights cancelled since then. The airline is now dealing with over 176,000 refund or reimbursement requests. The estimated cost of the outages could reach as high as $500 million.The company’s CEO Ed Bastian said last week the outage had cost the airline $500 million, adding that it plans to take legal action to get compensation from the cybersecurity firm.Microsoft outage on July 19 was caused by a faulty software update that impacted 8 million Windows computers worldwide.

This marks the first time the DGGI has issued such a notice to a cryptocurrency firm, setting a significant precedent in India’s efforts to regulate the rapidly growing virtual currency market.Sources confirmed that the notice was issued to Binance for collecting fees from Indian customers trading in virtual digital assets (VDAs) on their platform, categorized under online information database access or retrieval (OIDAR) services.Earlier this year, Binance received approval from India’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) to register as a virtual asset service provider (VASP). However, the company was slapped with a Rs 18 crore penalty from the FIU last month for non-compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) regulations.Despite being a major player in the global cryptocurrency market, with at least 40% market share and operations across more than 150 countries, Binance had not registered under the Indian GST framework. This oversight has now brought the company under the scrutiny of Indian tax authorities.“Binance reportedly earned at least Rs 4,000 crore from transaction fees charged to Indian customers. The company has a user base of 90 million users globally, including a substantial number of customers from India too. Detailed investigation revealed that the earnings of these fees were credited to the account of a Binance Group Company — Nest Services Limited — based in Seychelles,” a top source privy to the development said.In fact, Binance is reportedly facing a trial in a Nigerian court for alleged tax evasion, following a crypto crackdown in the country.To make Binance compliant with the GST regulations, DGGI Ahmedabad zonal unit also sent emails to Binance group companies in Seychelles, the Cayman Islands and Switzerland, which did not elicit a response. Binance appointed a local counsel in India to liaise with the DGGI, marking the first step towards resolving this significant tax compliance issue.Sources confirmed that DGGI is also closely monitoring financial transactions and activities of online gaming platforms and marketplaces for the possibility of tax evasion.The Indian GST regime mandates that foreign service providers pay GST for services provided to Indian residents, particularly under the OIDAR category. As the investigation continues, other cryptocurrency exchanges operating both overseas and within India are also expected to face scrutiny from tax authorities, said sources.","The Ahmedabad zonal unit of the Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGGI) has issued a show cause notice to Binance.

The new offering promises lightning-fast 8-16 minute deliveries for a diverse range of products, spanning from groceries to electronics.With this move, Flipkart directly challenges established players in the booming quick commerce sector, including Swiggy's Instamart, Zomato's Blinkit , Zepto , and BigBasket's BB Now.The service, which was previously offered on a trial basis to employees at Flipkart's headquarters, is now available to users through the Flipkart app.We confirmed the service's availability by checking an address in HSR on the Flipkart app, which indeed showed Flipkart Minutes as an option for quick delivery. Additionally, several users on X (formerly Twitter) reported that Flipkart is delivering groceries and other items to their addresses in Bengaluru within minutes through the ""Minutes"" service.Sources familiar with the matter tell the Economic Times that Flipkart plans to expand the service to more areas in Bengaluru over the next few weeks.The launch of Flipkart Minutes comes at a time when other players in the quick commerce space are aggressively expanding their operations.The ET had earlier reported that Flipkart was planning to operate around 100 dark stores to bolster its quick-commerce offerings during the upcoming festive season. Dark stores, which are mini warehouses strategically located for rapid deliveries, have become a crucial component of quick commerce operations.Blinkit, for instance, recently announced ambitious plans to increase its dark store count to 2,000 by 2026. This doubles down on its earlier announced plans to have 1,000 dark stores by March 2025. Similarly, Zepto aims to double its network to 700 dark stores by March 2025. Swiggy Instamart , another major player, currently operates more than 500 such warehouses.Interestingly, Amazon, a key player in the e-commerce space, has not shown interest in the quick-commerce business in India so far. However, it does operate a grocery store service dubbed "" Amazon Fresh ,"" offering same-day delivery for groceries.

What doctor said

An Apple Watch user is crediting the smartwatch for saving his life after the wearable alerted him about a life-threatening condition. Peter Moore , a resident of Montecito, California shared his experience with a local news publisher KTLA. Narrating the incident, he said “I wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for this little device”.Moore, who is a former tech executive, said that he was on his way to the airport when he began to feel “a little lightheaded and a little faint”.“Like a typical male, I thought, ‘I’ll go to Starbucks. That’ll fix it,'” Moore explained before he received a notification from the Apple Watch he was wearing.“My phone started to ping and said ‘low heart rate,’ which I’d never seen before. And so I looked at it… my heart rate had dropped to 32. And it was insistent in its notifications that something wasn’t right,” said Moore. He then contacted his wife who took him to hospital.“The doctor kind of theatrically ran in and said, ‘This is not good. This is not good. You need a pacemaker right now,'” Moore said.Omid Yousefian, the cardiac electrophysiologist at Sansum Clinic Cardiology who treated Moore said “Yes, his watch had a big role in saving his life”.“These days, 25% of the population over the age of 40 … have a high chance of experiencing atrial fibrillation,” Yousefian explained.“For us physicians, symptoms are the most important thing. [Moore] was notified by his watch that his heart rate is slow and he correlated that with the symptoms that he had. So he didn’t wait. He didn’t sit. He came to the hospital directly. So he made a very smart move,” Yousefian told the publication.","Peter Moore, a former tech executive, was on his way to the airport when he began to feel “a little lightheaded and a little faint” He received a notification from the Apple Watch he was wearing that his heart rate had dropped to 32.

What exactly happened

Read the complete post here

In a shocking incident, a Supreme Court lawyer, Mukul P Unny , was scammed out of Rs 38,000 while attempting to exchange his iPhone 13 for an iPhone 15 on Amazon .in. The lawyer detailed his ordeal on social media, highlighting the fraudulent tactics employed by the delivery executive.Unny took X (formerly known as Twitter) to post about the new kind of smartphone exchange scam.The incident occurred on July 21, 2024, when Unny placed an order for the iPhone 15 on Amazon. The following day, a delivery executive arrived at his residence and handed over the new phone after receiving the necessary OTP. However, the executive then requested another OTP, claiming it was required to complete the exchange.Despite Unny's hesitation, he was convinced to return the new iPhone to the delivery executive after speaking to the latter's supervisor.Unny contacted Amazon customer care the following day to report the incident. Initially, Amazon assured him of a refund if the product was not delivered. However, subsequent inquiries revealed the case was under investigation with a resolution deadline of July 31.On July 31st, Amazon concluded its investigation and informed Unny that a refund was impossible. The company's explanation lacked substance, as they had not thoroughly verified the scam details. The fact that Unny still possessed his old iPhone directly contradicted Amazon's claim that the exchange was complete.While Amazon has eventually issued a refund to Unny, his ordeal underscores the considerable risks inherent in online transactions, even when dealing with reputable platforms like Amazon.Always verify the identity of a delivery executive before sharing your Amazon OTP. This crucial step can protect you from falling victim to scams.“This is the story of my worst experience with @amazonIN On 21.07.2024, I ordered iPhone 15 from Amazon in exchange for my iPhone 13. On 22.07.2024, the delivery executive came at around 930 PM. I gave the OTP and took the product, and gave my phone to the executive.He said I have give another OTP. I had already given the OTP and was wondering what other OTP is to be given for exchange. I said I dont have any other OTP than the one I have given. He stayed there for few minutes & then called his supervisor.After speaking with the supervisor, the delivery exec asked for return of the product since the ""exchange is not final"".I insisted that I speak with the supervisor. The supervisor tells me that the exchange is done by a different team & requests for the product to be returned. I said I cannot give away the product especially since the OTP is given and the app was showing that the product is delivered. But this supervisor Ashok (8076650306) requested me to return, lest his team will have to make for the loss.Upon his request and assurance that the product will be ""reattempted"" the next day, I gave the product to the delivery exec (Vishal 8826421956) after taking the supervisor's and the delivery exec's number. On 23.07.2024, I spoke with the Amazon Customer Care and raised a complaint to which I assured that refund will be initiated if the product is not delivered. Call centre asked me to follow up on 25.07.2024.On 26.07.2024,when I called them, the customer case asked me to wait till 31.05.2024 as ""it has to be investigated"". Today, when I call Amazon, they said ""investigation"" is complete and that refund cannot be initiated. No fact-finding was done by Amazon in this. Now, we are staring at a loss of Rs. 38000 and a possible scam done by supervisor, delivery exec and others at Amazon. If they say that the exchange is done, then they can very well see the old phone that I still use with me.This could happen to any one of you and please be aware while dealing with @amazonIN.”","Supreme Court lawyer Mukul P Unny was scammed out of Rs 38,000 while attempting to exchange his iPhone 13 for an iPhone 15 on Amazon.in.
