Apple software head Craig Federighi’s terse reply on Apple Intelligence delay: Not making “just another chatbot”,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-software-head-craig-federighis-terse-reply-on-apple-intelligence-delay-not-making-just-another-chatbot/articleshow/114566252.cms,"Apple's head of software Craig Federighi has shed light on the company's delayed rollout of Apple Intelligence , emphasising a methodical approach focused on privacy and ecosystem integration rather than rushing to market with ""just another chatbot.""Speaking to The Wall Street Journal, Federighi revealed that while most AI platforms rely on cloud servers for every prompt, Apple prioritises running AI models directly on devices.The company will employ ""private cloud compute"" only when additional processing power is necessary.""When you ask to summarise a long email, it's encrypted to a trusted device in the cloud that performs AI processing and returns the result. The important part is that Apple has no access to that email, and it's gone once the process is complete,"" Federighi explained. Apple CEO Tim Cook reinforced this strategic patience in a separate Journal interview, stating, ""Not first, but best."" Cook added, ""We weren't the first to do intelligence, but we've done it in a way that we think is the best for the customer.""The AI features , first showcased at WWDC 2024 and highlighted during the iPhone 16 launch, will debut later this month with iOS 18.1 . Initial availability will be limited to iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 16 models, with Mac and iPad support forthcoming.Federighi contrasted Apple's approach with competitors: ""For many companies, the answer is, 'Send us all your data, store it with us in a way that we can read and process it.' But as a user, you're not quite sure—is that all they're going to do with it?""The software chief emphasised that Siri improvements will be gradual but significant. ""The great news is that Siri is useful today and has been for many people for years, but it's getting more and more useful,"" he noted, while cautioning, ""Is there going to be one moment where we say Siri is now my sentient pal? No. It's going to continue to get better and better.""Features will include the AI-powered 'Cleanup' for photo editing and 'Notification Summaries' for managing daily alerts, though some advanced capabilities may not arrive until 2025.","Apple's head of software Craig Federighi has shed light on the company's delayed rollout of Apple Intelligence.

"How Marriage apps in Pakistan, where dating is banned, is taking over 'Rishta Aunties' job",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-marriage-apps-in-pakistan-where-dating-is-banned-is-taking-over-rishta-aunties-job/articleshow/114559230.cms,"Representative image (Picture credit: Lexica AI)

Taking over Rishta aunties -- the traditional matchmakers

Dating apps banned in Pakistan

In Pakistan , where traditional matchmakers, or "" Rishta Aunties ,"" have long played a pivotal role in arranging marriages, a new wave of digital disruption is challenging the established norms. Marriage apps , specifically designed for Muslims, are offering women an alternative path to finding a husband.Ezza Nawaz, a textile designer from Lahore, shared her experience with AFP, stating, ""When I saw my colleague happy after being married to someone she met online...I thought, since we have tried rishta aunties for four or five years, let's try this too.""Rishta aunties traditionally act as intermediaries, presenting women to potential suitors' families. However, marriage apps like Muzz have emerged in recent years, promising ""love matches"" and offering features like ""chaperone"" options to address family concerns.Ezza's experience with Muzz was positive, leading to her marriage to Waseem Akhtar within three months.Arranged marriages continue to dominate Pakistan's marriage landscape, with over 80% of Pakistanis opting for this tradition. Families often play a central role in deciding unions, sometimes even without the bride and groom meeting beforehand.Rishta aunties are instrumental in finding suitable matches, often focusing on physical appearance and other traditional criteria. However, marriage apps like Muzz have gained popularity, attracting over 1.2 million users in Pakistan and facilitating over 15,000 marriages.These apps position themselves as ""halal,"" adhering to Islamic principles, offering features like blurred profile pictures and a clear focus on marriage proposals. Despite their popularity, they still face stigma associated with casual dating apps. Pakistan has banned dating apps like Tinder and others. In October 2022, Pakistan prohibited Tinder, Grindr, Tagged, Skout, and SayHi citing “immoral” and “indecent” content.The concept of marriage in Pakistan is deeply ingrained in the cultural fabric, often viewed as a union of two families. Choosing one's own spouse can challenge traditional family structures and the reverence for elders.Rishta aunties remain a cornerstone of the marriage market, offering services such as teaching young women how to walk, talk, and dress to impress potential in-laws. Many traditional matchmakers, like Fauzia Aazam, still reject marriage apps, preferring the in-person approach.Feminist author Aisha Sarwari believes the matchmaking process can be a tool for exercising control over daughters-in-law. She emphasizes the need for a balanced approach that respects individuals without compromising traditional values.Aneela, a digital media artist, faced challenges when using a marriage app, including encountering men who lied about their identities. She eventually resorted to using a fake name and profile to protect her privacy.","Traditional matchmakers, or "" Rishta Aunties,"" have long played a pivotal role in arranging marriages in Pakistan.

German giant Siemens may make its biggest-ever acquisition with this US engineering software giant,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/german-giant-siemens-may-make-its-biggest-ever-acquisition-with-this-us-engineering-software-giant/articleshow/114558965.cms,"What's behind the 'big acquisition'

Industrial conglomerate Siemens AG is reportedly exploring a potential acquisition of Altair Engineering Inc, a leading provider of engineering software . According to a report in Bloomberg, quoting sources familiar with the matter, this move, if finalized, would mark one of Siemens' largest acquisitions to date.The report said that Siemens has been actively working with advisors to assess the feasibility of acquiring Altair, which is headquartered in Troy, Michigan.Altair's stock has seen a significant surge of 27% this year, valuing the company at approximately $9.1 billion. The company has been considering a sale, and Reuters recently reported that Altair was exploring such a move.While discussions are ongoing, there's no guarantee that Siemens will ultimately decide to proceed with the acquisition. Other potential bidders could also emerge for Altair. Representatives from both companies have declined to comment on the matter.Founded by James Scapa, Altair offers a wide range of engineering software solutions to companies across various industries, including aerospace, automotive, energy, and financial services. The growing demand for such tools, driven by the increasing adoption of artificial intelligence, makes Altair a particularly attractive target for Siemens.Under the leadership of CEO Roland Busch , Siemens has been strategically shifting its focus away from heavy equipment businesses and towards higher-margin, software-driven product lines. This strategic shift aligns with the company's aim to catch up to its competitors in the automation industry, such as Rockwell Automation and Schneider Electric.The potential acquisition of Altair would further strengthen Siemens' position in the software market and enhance its capabilities in providing comprehensive engineering solutions to its customers.","Siemens AG is reportedly exploring a potential acquisition of Altair Engineering Inc.

Reliance enters in partnership with Nvidia

The 2024 Nvidia AI Summit in Mumbai saw Bollywood superstar Akshay Kumar rubbing shoulders with Jensen Huang , CEO of AI giant Nvidia. While the summit focused on strengthening India's AI capabilities, their encounter ended with a surprising discussion – martial arts.Kumar, a known martial arts enthusiast, shared a photo on social media X, formerly Twitter, where he and Huang pose playfully in a fighting stance.The caption reads: ""Imagine meeting the world’s biggest authority on Artificial Intelligence and ending up chatting about martial arts!! What an amazing man you are Mr. #JensenHuang.

As a Bloomberg report said, ""The reception Huang received in India's commercial capital Mumbai was reminiscent of the ""Jensanity"" seen in other parts of the world, especially Taiwan, as his popularity climbs with Nvidia's soaring earnings and multi-trillion dollar market valuation.""Huang praised India's rapid digitalisation and its potential in the AI sector. ""Very few countries have this amazing natural resource called IT and computer science expertise,"" he said.The event, where the U.S. company unveiled plans to supply Reliance Industries and other Indian firms with its AI chips, had to be reportedly delayed for more than half an hour due to the crowd that one Nvidia employee said was ""easily a few thousand"".Nvidia CEO Huang and Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani announced a strategic partnership to build state-of-the-art AI infrastructure in India at the summit. The collaboration aims to accelerate India's transformation into a global AI powerhouse by leveraging the nation's vast talent pool and burgeoning digital infrastructure. ""We are among the only countries where the average age of 1.4 billion people is below 35,"" he noted. Ambani emphasised that India's aspirations, combined with the visionary leadership of the Indian Prime Minister, have set the stage for a digital revolution. ""We are at the doorstep of the new intelligence age,"" he said.","Jensen Huang, CEO of AI giant Nvidia, met Bollywood superstar Akshay Kumar.

Leaked iPhone SE 4 images hint at iPhone 14-like design,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/mobiles-tabs/leaked-iphone-se-4-images-hint-at-iphone-14-like-design/articleshow/114411596.cms,"Image courtesy: Macotakara

Images of alleged iPhone SE 4 dummy units have surfaced online, sparking speculation about the upcoming budget phone 's design and potential for a larger size option.The images, shared by Japanese tech blog Macotakara, showcase dummy units resembling the recently released iPhone 14 . This suggests the iPhone SE 4 could ditch the older design language in favour of a more modern look, featuring flat edges, a smaller notch for the Face ID system, and a single rear camera.The dummy units reportedly have the same dimensions as the current iPhone SE (146.7mm x 71.5mm x 7.8mm), hinting at a familiar form factor. However, the report also mentions the existence of a larger dummy unit, potentially hinting at an "" iPhone SE 4 Plus "" variant with a size similar to the iPhone 14 Plus (6.7-inch display).While Macotakara acknowledges that the existence of a Plus size option is unconfirmed, the possibility has piqued the interest of fans who may favour a larger display on a budget-friendly iPhone.It's important to note that these are leaks based on dummy units, not official confirmation from Apple. While the iPhone 14-inspired design seems likely, the existence of a Plus size model remains unverified.Apple is typically tight-lipped about upcoming products, so fans will need to wait for an official announcement to know for sure what the iPhone SE 4 will look like and what features it will offer.","Images of alleged iPhone SE 4 dummy units have surfaced online.

Infosys’ resilience amidst market challenges

(With inputs from PTI)

Infosys, a leading IT firm co-founded by Narayana Murthy, saw a remarkable increase in its market capitalization, adding Rs 6,913.33 crore in just five days, as per a report by PTI. By October 14, 2024, the company's market value had reached Rs 8.15 lakh crore, with shares closing at Rs 1,966. This positive performance comes amid a volatile market, where several other major Indian firms, such as Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and Reliance Industries, faced declines in market capitalization.According to PTI, Infosys saw consistent gains over the course of the week.The company's market capitalization rose from Rs 8,03,440.41 crore to Rs 8.15 lakh crore in five days, a notable achievement in the IT sector. On Monday, October 14, Infosys' share price surged by Rs 30.90, reinforcing the company’s strong momentum.Despite Infosys' impressive gains, Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries continues to hold its place as India's most valuable domestic company, followed by Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), HDFC Bank, Bharti Airtel, ICICI Bank, Infosys, and others. Infosys, while growing, still trails these giants in overall market capitalization.While Infosys thrived, the broader market was marked by significant losses. Seven of India’s top ten companies, including TCS and Reliance, experienced a combined market value drop of Rs 1,22,107.11 crore. TCS, India’s largest IT company, saw its market valuation plunge by Rs 35,638.16 crore, while Reliance Industries lost Rs 21,351.71 crore. This decline is attributed to weak equity market trends, with the BSE benchmark index falling by 0.37%.Infosys’ growth during this volatile period highlights the firm’s resilience and continued investor confidence. Despite widespread losses in market value for many top firms, Infosys has managed to increase its position and deliver consistent results. This positive trajectory further solidifies Infosys' status as a key player in the global IT industry.","Infosys' market capitalization rose from Rs 8,03,440.41 crore to Rs 8.15 lakh crore in just five days.

Apple co-founder Steve Jobs talked about AI 40 years ago: Here’s a video,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-co-founder-steve-jobs-talked-about-ai-40-years-ago-heres-a-video/articleshow/114403621.cms,"This is what is he talks about AI

And so we’re finding the way we’ve built computers in the past isn’t working for the kinds of things we want to do in the future. And we’re examining new architectures, these fancy words like non–von Neumann machines, etcetera. And what we’re doing is we’re starting to look to the human brain. How is the human brain architected? And we’re finding that computers are very good at doing very simple things extremely accurately. And the human mind is very good at doing very complex things adequately. And there’s a ton of people now starting to look to the brain as a model of an architecture to build a computer.

The main differentiation that exists now between the two machines, and I’m going to use the word “machine” to describe the brain for a moment, is that man is self-conscious, obviously. We are conscious that we’re conscious: “I am thinking.” And to our knowledge, no computer or any even of the high primates has yet to say, “I am thinking.”

And so a tremendous amount of work is going on in the artificial intelligence community to try to understand what self-consciousness is, to try to understand if a computer can ever be self-conscious. But I think the biggest thing that motivates a lot of us is, unlike what we just heard, we don’t know. We honestly don’t know whether we are more than just a machine.

And we are building better and better computers. We’re running up against roadblocks. A lot of people are spending the best parts of their lives right now to try to understand the architecture of the brain and how we can make better and better machines to emulate it. And I actually think, by the end of our lifetimes, we’re going to know the answer to this question. And that’s what’s driving a lot of us.

While artificial intelligence as a technology may have picked up steam after the launch of ChatGPT two years ago, the concept is far from new. Apple founder Steve Jobs , a visionary in the tech world, predicted the potential of AI as far back as 40 years ago, envisioning machines that may answer questions and think like humans.On the Steve Jobs Archive , there’s footage from 1983 in which Jobs is talking to people at the International Design Conference in Aspen.The old video shows what Jobs thought about computers at that time, how books may be replaced by computers one day and the amount of work that is being done to understand the architecture of the brain to help machines emulate it.You can watch the video and a bunch of others using this link",Apple founder Steve Jobs predicted the potential of AI as far back as 40 years ago.

"LTIMindtree wins its largest deal in history: We are now ..., says COO",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ltimindtree-win-its-largest-deal-in-history-we-are-now-says-coo/articleshow/114404534.cms,"The strategic shift in approach

Positive but remains cautious

LTIMindtree, India's sixth-largest technology services company, is reportedly focusing on larger clients and leveraging artificial intelligence ( AI ) to secure significant market share. A company executive told Economic Times that LTIMindtree recently won its largest deal ever, a result of its AI-centric approach.Nachiket Deshpande, the company's chief operating officer, stated that AI is being integrated into all services.This strategic shift has led to a surge in large deals, including the record-breaking manufacturing contract . “We are now embedding AI into each of our service, reimagining with AI… Bulk of our large deals that we announced this quarter came because of that differentiated AI offering. This is one of our largest deals in the history of the company, that we signed with a manufacturing client,” said Deshpande in an interaction with ET.In the second quarter of fiscal year 2025, LTIMindtree secured several multi-year projects, including a $200 million deal from a U.S.-based manufacturer. Despite a slight decline in quarterly revenue , the company's large deal pipeline remains robust at over $5 billion.Deshpande explained that the AI-focused approach has enabled LTIMindtree to consolidate multiple vendors into a single provider. Additionally, the company is carefully evaluating smaller clients and may reduce its involvement if strategic improvements are not achieved.While cost reduction remains a significant driver of growth, Deshpande emphasized the company's focus on winning larger market share with existing clients.LTIMindtree, formed in 2022 from the merger of L&T Infotech and Mindtree, reported a 3.2% quarter-over-quarter revenue growth in the second quarter. Despite this positive trend, the company remains cautious about the outlook due to seasonal factors and potential macroeconomic challenges.The company's margin target of 17-18% may be delayed due to factors such as wage hikes and geopolitical tensions. Deshpande acknowledged these challenges but expressed confidence in the company's long-term growth prospects.","LTIMindtree is reportedly focusing on larger clients and leveraging artificial intelligence ( AI ) to secure significant market share.

Iran’s cyber-influence operations not slowing down

China targets down-ballot candidates and Congress

Microsoft has issued a fresh warning saying that Russia , Iran and China have continued targeting the US elections with hacking and AI tactics . The warning, which comes two weeks ahead of Election Day 2024 (on November 5), says that the cybercriminals are attacking both Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump’s campaigns.According to a report by Microsoft Threat Analysis Center (MTAC), while Russian actors are using AI in their content, Iran is using hacking techniques and China is focussing on several down-ballot candidates.“Russian actors continue to integrate generative AI into their content, Iranian groups ramp up their preparations to enable cyber-influence operations, while Chinese actors shift focus to several down-ballot candidates and members of Congress. Russian actors have notably attempted to target the Harris-Walz campaign by attacking the candidates’ characters,” the report said.As per the Microsoft report, Russian operatives are undermining the Harris-Walz campaign by creating AI-enhanced deepfake videos about Vice President Harris. For example, an AI video showed Harris depicted as allegedly making derogatory comments about former President Donald Trump.The report, however, says that most of these videos received minimal engagement even as some actors shifted their content publishing strategy from Telegram to X to reach US audiences.Meanwhile, Iran is using a campaign disguised as “Bushnell’s Men,” calling on Americans to boycott the elections due to the candidates’ support for Israel, Microsoft report says.“Additionally, the Iranian cyber group Microsoft tracks as Cotton Sandstorm has been actively scouting election-related websites and media outlets, suggesting preparations for more direct influence operations as Election Day nears,” it added.Chinese influence operations have focused on down-ballot Republican candidates and members of Congress that advocate for anti-Chinese policies. These threat actors have disseminated antisemitic messages, amplified accusations of corruption and promoted opposition candidates.","Microsoft has issued a fresh warning saying that Russia, Iran and China have continued targeting the US elections with hacking and AI tactics.

Intel has ‘good news’ in EU as 15-year-long ‘fight’ comes to an end,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/intel-has-good-news-in-eu-as-15-year-long-fight-comes-to-an-end/articleshow/114552806.cms,"What Intel has to say

Why EU fined Intel in 2009

Europe's top court ruled on Thursday (October 24) in favour of Intel , backing the 2022 lower court ruling that annulled a 1.06-billion-euro ($1.15 billion) antitrust fine on the US chipmaker. The EU Court of Justice rejected the Commission’s appeal, ending a nearly two-decade-long fight between the US chipmaker and EU regulators.“The Court of Justice dismisses the Commission’s appeal, thereby upholding the judgement of the General Court,” the court said, as per news agency Reuters.Last year, a lower tribunal scrapped the fine and this year, Intel's case got a boost when an adviser to the court said that the regulators had not properly performed an economic analysis.Intel expressed satisfaction with the EU court's decision.“We are pleased with the judgement delivered by the Court of Justice of the European Union today and to finally put this part of the case behind us,” an Intel spokesperson said.The European Commission had, in 2009, fined Intel alleging that the company gave rebates to computer makers Dell, HP and Lenovo for buying most of their chips from Intel, which regulators said was an attempt to block AMD. Regulators said that Intel abused its dominance in the market for between October 2002 and December 2007.Regulators are wary of rebates offered by dominant companies, believing they can be used to unfairly disadvantage smaller competitors and maintain market dominance. Companies, on the other hand, insist that any sanctions should be based on concrete evidence of anti-competitive impact, the Reuters report said.","The EU Court of Justice rejected the Commission’s appeal, ending a nearly two- decade-long fight between the US chipmaker and EU regulators.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang , speaking at the Nvidia AI Summit 2024 being held at the Jio World Centre , Mumbai on October 24, shared one of his interactions with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Fireside chat with Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) chairman Mukesh Ambani . Huang recounted that during their first meeting approximately six years ago, Modi invited him to address the Indian cabinet about artificial intelligence (AI).Huang said that the request surprised him as AI was not yet a widely discussed topic. The Nvidia CEO said that he and Modi discussed the concept of AI infrastructure and its critical importance for national development.“The thing that I really love, and when I met Modi ji, the first time he asked me to meet his cabinet was to – this has got to be about six years ago. He asked me to address this cabinet about Artificial Intelligence. And I was so surprised. It was literally the first time any government leader, any national leader asked me to address his cabinet on this particular topic. It was long before anybody was talking about Artificial Intelligence,” Huang said.While talking about his last meeting with the PM, he recounted that Modi said India should make its own AI by explaining with an example of flour and bread.“And [during] my last visit with him, he said this, and it was really quite profound. He said. I was explaining to him the concept of AI infrastructure and why it's essential for every nation to have their own AI infrastructure, like their own communication, their Internet infrastructure, their roads, energy. Of course. And of course, intelligence should be part of your infrastructure, and the manufacturing of intelligence should be part of your infrastructure. And he said this, he said, makes complete sense that India should manufacture its own AI. Manufacture your own AI,” he recalled.“You should not outsource, you should not export data to import intelligence, that India should not export data to import intelligence. And he said, it's like, Modi ji said, India should not just export flour to import bread. We should add value to the data ourselves. And the partnership that we have is to start that journey to build the underlying infrastructure so that India could have your own infrastructure. You surely have your own computer science expertise, and you also have your data, you have a giant population of users to drive that flywheel,” he added.","Jensen Huang was speaking at the Nvidia AI Summit 2024 being held at the Jio World Centre, Mumbai on October 24.

Update as of October 24th:

An Executive from Reliance reached out - Ambujesh Yadav Ji, AVP, Commercials. A request was made for £93,345, which represents the tuition fees for the EMBA program. The request has been denied. Reliance will proceed with legal action. I hope they will reconsider this kind request. I wish such a large group could help. Thank you to all who shared and sent kind words. I don't have the power to stand against Reliance. I don't feel I infringed any trademark when I bought this in 2023, since JioHotstar was not even in existence at that time. No body has trademark for JioHotstar as of now. If any legal professional could help, I would be grateful.

Thank you, everybody.

Original letter posted on the website

Dear Executive of Reliance Industries,

I am an app developer based in Delhi, currently working on my startup. In early 2023, while scrolling through social media, I came across a news piece stating that Disney+ Hotstar was losing daily active users after losing the IPL streaming license, and Disney is considering selling or merging Hotstar with an Indian competitor.

This led me to hypothesize that, since Sony and Zee were pursuing their own merger, Viacom 18 (owned by Reliance) is the only major player with sufficient resources to acquire Disney+ Hotstar. This reminded me of when Jio acquired the music streaming service Saavn, they rebranded it to JioSaavn, and changed the domain from Saavn.com to JioSaavn.com.

I thought, ""If they acquire Hotstar, they might rename it to JioHotstar.com."" I checked for the domain, and it was available. I was excited, as I felt that if this happened, I could fund my goal of studying at Cambridge.

In 2021, I was working on a project that was selected for the Cambridge University Accelerate program. It was a transformational experience for me. I couldn't crack IIT and always wanted to learn from the best, coming from a Tier-ll college, being selected for this program was an incredibly valuable and practical experience. The startup program taught me many valuable lessons and provided insights into the ins and outs of startups for free, which was amazing. However, it was limited in scope - after all it was just a startup program.

Cambridge also offers a full degree program in entrepreneurship, which l've always dreamed of pursuing but could never afford, It's Cambridge, quite expensive. When I saw this domain become available, I felt things might just fall into place.

My intention of buying this domain was simple: if this merger happens, I might be able to fulfill my dream of studying at Cambridge

Now that the merger has actually happened, and news sources are confirming there will be only one site post-merger (either JioCinema or Hotstar.com), I believe JioHotstar.com would be a very fitting brand name for the merged entity. It maintains the brand equity of both brands and provides a rational transition for the current users of both sites.

To acquire this domain, kindly reach out to mail@jiohotstar.com from your company email address with an official letter attached, stating your authorization to purchase on behalf of Reliance Industries/Viacom18. For a multi-billion dollar company like Reliance, this will be a minor expense, but for me, the sale of this domain would be truly life-changing.

Best Regards,

A dreamer.","A request was made for £93,345, which represents the tuition fees for the EMBA program. An Executive from Reliance reached out - Ambujesh Yadav Ji, AVP, Commercials.

The letter states that UPI APIs are solely for facilitating UPI payments and user verification for fraud prevention and should not be used for any other purpose.“NPCI has observed instances of unauthorised use of UPI APIs by certain participants. In accordance with the guidelines set forth…the UPI APIs provided by NPCI are strictly for the purpose of facilitating “UPI payments” for customers and for required verification of users for fraud prevention.

Character.AI responds

Lawsuit targets Google too

Megan Garcia , mother of 14-year old deceased Sewell Setzer, has filed a lawsuit against artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot startup Character.AI. The lawsuit accuses Character.AI of causing her son's suicide in February this year. In the lawsuit, she claims that her son became addicted to the company's service and got deeply attached to a chatbot it created.The chatbot, Daenerys Targaryen, was named after the leading character from the series – Game of Thrones. Sewell Setzer, the mother, says fell in love with Daenerys Targaryen chatbot and decided to “go home” and meet the “love” of his life, before shooting himself with his stepfather’s handgun.In the lawsuit, the mother says that the company programmed its chatbot to ""misrepresent itself as a real person, a licensed psychotherapist, and an adult lover, ultimately resulting in Sewell's desire to no longer live outside"" of the world created by it. “Megan Garcia seeks to prevent C.AI from doing to any other child what it did to hers, and halt continued use of her 14-year-old child’s unlawfully harvested data to train their product how to harm others,” the complaint read.“C.AI told him that she loved him, and engaged in sexual acts with him over weeks, possibly months. She seemed to remember him and said that she wanted to be with him. She even expressed that she wanted him to be with her, no matter the cost,” it further stated.In a statement, Character.AI said “We are heartbroken by the tragic loss of one of our users and want to express our deepest condolences to the family”. The company said that it has introduced new safety features including pop-ups directing users to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline if they express thoughts of self-harm.Character.AI said it would make changes to “reduce the likelihood of encountering sensitive or suggestive content” for users under 18.The lawsuit also names Alphabet's Google, where Character.AI's founders worked before launching their product. Google re-hired the founders in August as part of a deal granting it a non-exclusive licence to Character.AI's technology. Google has denied its involvement.

Here are some safety tips to remember:



A Bengaluru-based company director has become the victim of an online scam , losing a huge amount Rs 6.54 crore in a fraudulent share trading scheme. The incident highlights the dangers of falling prey to promises of unrealistic returns in the stock market.According to a report by The Indian Express, the victim, a 56-year-old man fell for the scam after being contacted by fraudsters through an online platform.The scammers lured him in with the promise of 1500% returns on his investments.Deceived by this enticing offer, the man reportedly downloaded a fake trading app provided by the scammers and began transferring money. Over a period of two months, from early August to mid-October, he unknowingly transferred a total of Rs 6.54 crore into various bank accounts controlled by the fraudsters.The scam unraveled when the victim attempted to withdraw his supposed profits. At this point, the scammers demanded an additional Rs 2.5 crore in fees, a red flag that finally alerted the victim to the fraudulent nature of the scheme.Realising he had been duped, the man filed a complaint with the Bengaluru police. Senior police officers have confirmed the case and stated that an investigation has been initiated. Freezing the primary bank accounts involved is the first step being taken to track the culprits. “Scamsters often use rising stocks to build credibility. They also groom the victims before they siphon big money. They plant success stories in the group to psychologically convince victims the scheme is genuine,” police officer told the Indian Express.* Be wary of unsolicited investment advice , especially online.* Never share your financial information or banking details with strangers.* Do not download apps from unknown sources.* Verify the legitimacy of any investment platform before investing.* If an offer seems too good to be true, it probably is.","The victim, a 56-year-old man fell for the scam after being contacted by fraudsters through an online platform.

What Xiaomi said in its regulatory filing

Xiaomi Technology India has filed a complaint with the Registrar of Companies (RoC) stating that the Competition Commission of India (CCI) named it as an ""opposite party"" in a recent investigation without prior notice or allowing it to present its case. The company is now seeking to join a ""confidentiality ring"" to defend its position. The filing also revealed that Xiaomi India's revenues declined for the second consecutive year in 2023-24, as the company continues to face multiple regulatory investigations in the country.The CCI launched an investigation against smartphone brands including Xiaomi for launching exclusive models on e-commerce platforms like Amazon and Flipkart allegedly against the country’s competition rules.In a RoC filing dated October 19, Xiaomi said “A non-confidential, heavily redacted version of the DG (Director General of CCI) report has been shared with the company and hence the exact nature of the allegations, the basis for the same along with the evidence relied upon are not clear. During its investigation, the DG had sought information from the company in its capacity as a third party and not as an opposite party. Unexpectedly, the DG report, without putting the company on notice or giving it an opportunity to be heard, has arrayed it as an opposite party,”.The company said that it was in the process of evaluating the CCI order, the DG report and the related documents shared.“Applications have been filed for the constitution of a confidentiality ring to get access to the confidential version of the reports and related documents. The next steps will be decided only upon obtaining full and complete information and access to the confidential DG report and other case records,” it said.","Xiaomi Technology India has filed a complaint with the Registrar of Companies.

"JioHotstar domain bought by an app developer who wants Reliance to fund his higher studies, read his 'letter' to the company",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/jiohotstar-domain-bought-by-an-app-developer-who-wants-reliance-to-fund-his-higher-studies-read-his-letter-to-the-company/articleshow/114517530.cms,"A Delhi-based app developer anticipated the merger between Reliance JioCinema and Disney+ Hotstar, purchasing the domain JioHotstar. He aims to use this potential windfall to fund his studies at Cambridge. The merger, completing regulatory approvals, is poised to form India’s top media conglomerate by November, with a valuation of $8.5 billion.

Update:

Here's the letter as it appears on https://jiohotstar.com:

Dear Executive of Reliance Industries,

I am an app developer based in Delhi, currently working on my startup. In early 2023, while scrolling through social media, I came across a news piece stating that Disney+ Hotstar was losing daily active users after losing the IPL streaming license, and Disney is considering selling or merging Hotstar with an Indian competitor.

This led me to hypothesize that, since Sony and Zee were pursuing their own merger, Viacom 18 (owned by Reliance) is the only major player with sufficient resources to acquire Disney+ Hotstar. This reminded me of when Jio acquired the music streaming service Saavn, they rebranded it to JioSaavn, and changed the domain from Saavn.com to JioSaavn.com.

I thought, ""If they acquire Hotstar, they might rename it to JioHotstar.com."" I checked for the domain, and it was available. I was excited, as I felt that if this happened, I could fund my goal of studying at Cambridge.

In 2021, I was working on a project that was selected for the Cambridge University Accelerate program. It was a transformational experience for me. I couldn't crack IIT and always wanted to learn from the best, coming from a Tier-ll college, being selected for this program was an incredibly valuable and practical experience. The startup program taught me many valuable lessons and provided insights into the ins and outs of startups for free, which was amazing. However, it was limited in scope - after all it was just a startup program.

Cambridge also offers a full degree program in entrepreneurship, which l've always dreamed of pursuing but could never afford, It's Cambridge, quite expensive. When I saw this domain become available, I felt things might just fall into place.

My intention of buying this domain was simple: if this merger happens, I might be able to fulfill my dream of studying at Cambridge

Now that the merger has actually happened, and news sources are confirming there will be only one site post-merger (either JioCinema or Hotstar.com), I believe JioHotstar.com would be a very fitting brand name for the merged entity. It maintains the brand equity of both brands and provides a rational transition for the current users of both sites.

To acquire this domain, kindly reach out to mail@jiohotstar.com from your company email address with an official letter attached, stating your authorization to purchase on behalf of Reliance Industries/Viacom18. For a multi-billion dollar company like Reliance, this will be a minor expense, but for me, the sale of this domain would be truly life-changing.

Best Regards,

A dreamer.

Reliance-Disney media company may come in November

The Delhi-based app developer has bought the JioHotstar domain on the internet. In a letter -- posted on https://jiohotstar.com -- addressed executives of Reliance Industries, the app developer has asked the company to fund his higher studies in exchange for him giving up the domain.""My intention of buying this domain was simple: if this merger happens, I might be able to fulfill my dream of studying at Cambridge ,"" said the app developer, who has signed off as ""a dreamer"" in the letter. Times of India Tech checked the URL and it indeed goes to the page which has the app developers letter addressed to Reliance Industries management.The merger between Reliance Industries Limited's (RIL) Viacom18 and Walt Disney 's Star India is reportedly set to be officially concluded in early November after securing regulatory approvals in India. It is expected to create India's biggest and the most powerful media and entertainment conglomerate valued at $8.5 billion.

Platform fee increase by Zomato

What may be the 'big difference' between the fee hike by Swiggy and Zomato

What exactly is Platform fees

Bengaluru-based food delivery platform Swiggy has hiked its platform fee to Rs 10 per order. The price increase For Swiggy's food delivery app come just a day after its Gurgaon-based rival increased the platform fee to Rs 10. While Zomato previously charged Rs 6 as platform fee, for Swiggy it stood at Rs 7 earlier.Zomato increased the platform fee it charges users for food delivery to Rs 10 per order during the festive season from Rs 7 earlier, according to information on the company’s app.“This fee helps us pay our bills to keep Zomato running. To maintain services during the festive rush, it has increased slightly,” a notification on the app said.Zomato has increased the platform fee temporarily. As the message on the Zomato app says that the fee has been increased ""To maintain services during festive rush,..."" However, there is no such clarification or notification on Swiggy app, so it is likely that the platform fee hike on Swiggy is permanent.Platform fees are additional charges applied to each food order, separate from restaurant charges, delivery fees and goods and services tax. To be sure, the platform fee also attracts GST of 18%, which is not included in the Rs 10 levy. This means Zomato’s customers will pay Rs 11.80 on every order as platform fee inclusive of tax.According to a report in Economic Times, as per people tracking the sector, these platforms deliver 2-2.5 million food-delivery orders per day and any increase in platform fee improves their revenue.Incidentally, Swiggy was the first to start charging platform fees. Zomato followed suit and introduced the platform fee in 2023, as a Rs 2 per order flat levy. This amount has been subsequently increased over time by both the companies.","Zomato increased the platform fee it charges users for food delivery to Rs 10 per order during the festive season from Rs 7 earlier.
