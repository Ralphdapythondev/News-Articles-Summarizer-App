"Apple makes it easier to switch from Google Photos to iCloud Photos, here‚Äôs how",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-makes-it-easier-to-switch-from-google-photos-to-icloud-photos-heres-how/articleshow/111648552.cms,"Here's how the new tool streamlines the transition

Switching from Google Photos to iCloud Photos just got significantly smoother. Thanks to a new data transfer tool developed collaboratively by Apple and Google, migrating your cherished memories is now a seamless process.Previously, transferring photos and videos from Google Photos to iCloud Photos involved a cumbersome manual download and upload process.This often discouraged users from switching, despite the potential benefits of iCloud Photos' integration with Apple devices.The new data transfer tool signifies a welcome collaboration between Apple and Google. This initiative, known as the Data Transfer Initiative , aims to empower users with more control over their data by simplifying the process of transferring information between different services.- Users can initiate the transfer directly within Google Takeout , Google's service for exporting data.- By selecting ""Apple - iCloud Photos"" as the destination, users can securely transfer their entire Google Photos library, including albums and descriptions, straight to iCloud Photos.- No need for manual downloads or uploads - the transfer happens seamlessly between the two services.While the transfer process is simplified, it's important to note that the original photos and videos remain in your Google Photos account unless you manually delete them after the transfer is complete. Additionally, the transfer time may vary depending on the size of your photo library.","New data transfer tool was developed collaboratively by Apple and Google.

What Microsoft leaving board seat at ChatGPT maker OpenAI means for Apple,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/what-microsoft-leaving-board-seat-at-chatgpt-maker-openai-means-for-apple/articleshow/111641931.cms,"What's behind Microsoft giving up board seat

In a sudden move, Microsoft announced its exit from ChatGPT maker OpenAI's board. Microsoft held an observer role on OpenAI's board. The company informed OpenAI the same in a letter. Microsoft has invested $13 billion in OpenAI. The company has been integrating OpenAI's tech across its Windows portfolio.Post Microsoft announcement, OpenAI spokesperson said that the startup won‚Äôt have board observers after Microsoft‚Äôs departure.There were reports that Apple was due to take up a similar role as Microsoft in OpenAI. At its recent annual developers conference, WWDC2024, Apple announced an AI partnership with OpenAI. Apple would not take the observer role on OpenAI's board after being widely expected to do so, the Financial Times reported, citing a person with direct knowledge of the matter.Microsoft took a non-voting, observer position on OpenAI's board in November 2023 after OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was fired unceremoniously. He was taken back just hours later in a management reshuffle that also saw board shakeup. The seat meant that Microsoft could attend OpenAI's board meetings and access confidential information but had no voting rights on matters including selecting or choosing directors. Apple joining the board would have meant the same rights for the iPhone maker.""We‚Äôre grateful to Microsoft for voicing confidence in the board and the direction of the company, and we look forward to continuing our successful partnership,‚Äù OpenAI said in a statement to Bloomberg News. Apple‚Äôs partnership with OpenAI brings ChatGPT to iPhones.Microsoft has relinquished its board seat after regulatory pressure in Europe and the US. Last month, European Union (EU) antitrust regulators said that the partnership between Microsoft and OpenAI would not be subjected to the bloc's merger rules because Microsoft does not control OpenAI, but they would instead seek third-party views on the exclusivity clauses in the agreement.The British and US antitrust watchdogs too continue to have concerns as well as questions about Microsoft's influence over OpenAI and the latter's independence. In January, the US Federal Trade Commission said it was looking into Microsoft‚Äôs investment in OpenAI as part of a broader inquiry into Big Tech companies and their partnerships with AI startups.",Microsoft announced its exit from ChatGPT maker OpenAI's board.

This Google's business is valued at double of Netflix and how analysts feel it can 'AI-proof' the company's search business,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/this-googles-business-is-valued-double-of-netflix-and-how-analysts-feel-it-can-ai-proof-the-companys-search-business/articleshow/111641893.cms,"YouTube can help protect Google from AI risks to its search business

Investors reportedly value Google parent Alphabet Inc at a staggering $2.3 trillion, recognizing its dominance in internet search and its pioneering role in artificial intelligence. However, according to a report in Bloomberg, analysts at Needham & Co. argue that this massive figure still fails to capture the true worth of YouTube , a subsidiary of Alphabet.In a recent note, Laura Martin and Dan Medina from Needham estimated YouTube's standalone value to be at least $455 billion, exceeding Netflix 's market cap by more than half. Alphabet's current structure, they argue, doesn't adequately reflect the value of its diverse businesses, particularly YouTube. They recommend buying Alphabet stock and have set a price target of $210, a 10% increase over its July 5th record close.""There's hidden value in YouTube that can't be traded separately,"" Martin explained in a separate interview, as per Bloomberg report. ""It's trapped within Google, a conglomerate facing various risks,"" she added, citing concerns about AI potentially disrupting search, a threat ""unrelated to YouTube."" Needham believes that separating YouTube would benefit investors interested in either its streaming dominance or Alphabet's role in AI. Even making just 5% of YouTube tradable could raise Alphabet's stock price by $15 per share, according to their analysis.Martin argues that conglomerates often struggle to attract investors because some might be interested in specific parts but not the entire company.Alphabet's complex structure has been criticized for obscuring the value of its individual businesses. Regulatory threats to break up the company have, in fact, been welcomed by many investors. However, Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist at LPL Financial, suggests that there's little indication of Alphabet or other tech giants considering such separations anytime soon.Meanwhile, YouTube's streaming dominance continues to grow as consumers shift away from traditional cable and broadcast TV. Ad revenue for the platform is projected to reach $37 billion in 2024 and $42 billion in 2025, reflecting a near 17% and 14% increase, respectively.While AI has been a major driver of Alphabet's recent stock surge, YouTube's role within the ""subscriptions, platforms and devices"" segment is a key growth engine and a rising contributor to overall revenue, as highlighted by Goldman Sachs analysts. They've reiterated their buy rating on Alphabet and increased their price target to $211, partly due to their revised, optimistic assumptions about YouTube's ad revenue growth.There are additional reasons for Alphabet to hold onto YouTube. Divyaunsh Divatia, an analyst at Janus Henderson Investors, considers YouTube a ""key pillar"" of Alphabet's AI strategy. He emphasizes the benefit YouTube derives from being part of the Google Web services ecosystem, while calling for more transparency from Alphabet to allow investors to better assess YouTube's growth drivers and value.Beyond YouTube, Needham's Martin believes there's value in potentially separating other Alphabet segments, such as its ad tech unit, currently facing a lawsuit from the US Department of Justice. In Martin's view, ""Alphabet is worth more in pieces than it is together.""",Investors reportedly value Google parent Alphabet Inc at a staggering $2.3 trillion.

BJP Plans 'mega' protest in Mysuru

BENGALURU: Opposition BJP intensified its attack on chief minister Siddaramaiah , releasing a set of documents to ‚Äúsubstantiate‚Äù claims that Mysuru Urban Development Authority (Muda) had favoured the CM‚Äôs wife by illegally allotting land.Presenting what he called ‚Äúvital documents‚Äù, Karnataka BJP president BY Vijayendra alleged serious violations and discrepancies involving Siddaramaiah and his family and called for him to resign.‚ÄúIf any chief minister engineered a scam while being at the helm and sought compensation from his own govt, it is Siddaramaiah,‚Äù Vijayendra said.He proceeded to outline specifics of the alleged scam, pointing to irregularities in allotment of land to Siddaramaiah‚Äôs wife, Parvathi alias Parvathamma. He said as per rules, she should have been allotted only two alternative 60x40ft sites for her 3.2 acres that was acquired, but instead, she was allotted 14 sites. ‚ÄúThis is totally illegal,‚Äù Vijayendra said.Vijayendra claimed Siddaramaiah did not declare these properties in his election affidavit in 2013, calling it a ‚Äúblatant violation‚Äù of Representation of the People Act 1951 and the model code of conduct (MCC) which was in effect at that time. ‚ÄúBJP is contemplating filing a formal complaint with the Election Commission of India,‚Äù he said.Vijayendra also highlighted the timeline and legal discrepancies surrounding the acquisition and subsequent transactions involving Siddaramaiah‚Äôs relatives. ‚ÄúThe land was acquired by Muda before it was purchased by CM‚Äôs brother-in-law and later given to CM‚Äôs wife through a gift deed,‚Äù he said. He disputed Siddaramaiah‚Äôs claims of receiving sites whose market value was far lower than the price of land Muda acquired. ‚ÄúHe got a total of 14 sites each worth more than Rs 2 crore,‚Äù he said, challenging the discrepancy between guidance values and actual market prices.Disputing remarks Siddaramaiah‚Äôs associates had made at a press conference that Muda began the acquisition process in 1992, denotified the land in 1998 and that it was purchased in 2004 by the CM‚Äôs brother-in-law, he said: ‚ÄúThe RTC (primary record of land ownership), clearly shows the land was already acquired by Muda. If this is true, the first question is how CM‚Äôs brother-in-law purchased the land that was in Muda‚Äôs possession. The gift deed also wrongfully states the acquired land is farmland.
