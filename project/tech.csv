Thanks @porsche and @westcoastcustoms for helping to make this happen.”Zuckerberg had the shop customize a manual Porsche 911 GT3 Touring in the same slate gray as Priscillia’s Cayenne Turbo GT Minivan, making a his and hers driving duo.

How Chinese hackers may have used two of the ‘biggest telecom networks in US’ to access sensitive data,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-chinese-hackers-may-have-used-two-of-the-biggest-telecom-networks-in-us-to-access-sensitive-data/articleshow/113992631.cms,"Who is behind the attack and which companies are impacted

What China has to say on hacking charges

Chinese hackers have reportedly infiltrated the networks of major US broadband providers , gaining access to sensitive information, including data from systems used for court-authorised wiretapping.The hackers may have access to network infrastructure used to cooperate with lawful US requests for communications data for months, says the report from a Wall Street Journal, which cited sources familiar with the matter as saying.The attackers also had access to other tranches of more generic internet traffic, they said.Verizon Communications , AT&T and Lumen Technologies are among the telecom companies affected by this breach. The hackers, believed to be part of a Chinese intelligence-gathering operation dubbed “Salt Typhoon” by US investigators, may have accessed and intercepted communications data legally obtained by the US government through court orders.The report also said that the hackers appear to have collected vast internet traffic from internet service providers. Additionally, there are indications that the hacking campaign targeted a small number of service providers outside of the US, the people were quoted as saying.“It will take time to unravel how bad this is, but in the meantime it’s the most significant in a long string of wake-up calls that show how the PRC has stepped up their cyber game. If companies and governments weren’t taking this seriously before, they absolutely need to now,” said Brandon Wales, former executive director at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and now a vice president at SentinelOne, referring to the People’s Republic of China.China's foreign ministry responded to the allegations, denying knowledge of the specific attack but accusing the US of fabricating a narrative to blame China.“At a time when cybersecurity has become a common challenge for all countries around the world, this erroneous approach will only hinder the efforts of the international community to jointly address the challenge through dialogue and cooperation,” the ministry said in a statement to news agency Reuters.This incident follows recent US efforts to disrupt other Chinese hacking groups, including “Flax Typhoon” and “Volt Typhoon.”",Hackers may have accessed and intercepted communications data legally obtained by the US government through court orders.

Google pays $2.7 billion to bring back an old employee leading to this big debate on overspending on AI,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-pays-2-7-billion-to-bring-back-an-old-employee-leading-to-this-big-debate-on-overspending-on-ai/articleshow/113993583.cms,"Representative Image

The 'overspending on AI' debate

Why Shazeer left Google after 21 years

Back to Google -- Homecoming

The AI Talent War

What Shazeer's return to Google may signify

Noam Shazeer , a pioneer in the field of artificial intelligence, left Google in 2021 after clashing with management over the release of a powerful chatbot he co-developed. However, in a surprising turn of events, Google has brought him back with a massive deal. According to a report in WSJ, Google paid a staggering $2.7 billion to acquire Shazeer's company, Character.AI .While officially presented as a technology licensing deal, the true prize was Shazeer himself. Now a Google vice president, he will spearhead the development of the company's next-generation AI project, Gemini . This aggressive move raises questions about the escalating cost of acquiring top AI talent. While Shazeer is undoubtedly a brilliant mind, some experts wonder if the price tag reflects his true value.As the report said, ""The arrangement has thrust him into the middle of a debate in Silicon Valley about whether tech giants are overspending in the race to develop cutting-edge AI, which some believe will define the future of computing.""Shazeer joined Google in the year 2000 and was among the company's first few employees. He's credited with co-authoring a groundbreaking research paper that became a cornerstone for modern AI. He also championed the creation of Meena, a chatbot capable of engaging conversations, which Google ultimately shelved over safety concerns.In 2017, Shazeer teamed with a Google colleague, Daniel De Freitas, to build a chatbot originally named Meena that could banter confidently on a range of topics. In a widely circulated memo, “Meena Eats the World,” Shazeer predicted it could replace Google’s search engine and produce trillions of dollars in revenue, said people familiar with the document.Google reportedly did not release the chatbot to the public, citing concerns around safety and fairness. Shazeer and De Freitas quit in 2021 to launch Character. ""Feeling Google lacked the boldness he believed was necessary for AI advancement, Shazeer left to launch Character.AI. Their vision: a chatbot that could benefit those struggling with loneliness or depression. However, the company faced an uphill battle against established giants and the high costs associated with AI development,"" said the report.With Character struggling financially, Google pounced on the opportunity to reacquire Shazeer's expertise. While the deal enriched him with hundreds of millions of dollars, Google's primary goal was to secure his talent.This hefty price tag reflects the intense competition for top AI talent. Google isn't alone in using ""acqui-hire"" deals to secure talent from struggling startups rather than go through lengthy acquisition processes. This approach allows them to quickly onboard coveted researchers whose companies lack a strong revenue stream.Shazeer's return signifies a shift in Google's approach to AI. Co-founder Sergey Brin signaled a more aggressive strategy, emphasizing a willingness to rapidly deploy AI technology. Shazeer's expertise will be crucial in Google's quest to stay ahead in the race for AI dominance. At a recent conference, Brin said that Google was previously too timid in deploying AI applications. Now, he said, Google is developing and launching AI technology as fast as it can. “Noam, by the way, is back at Google, which is awesome,” he added.","Noam Shazeer, a pioneer in the field of artificial intelligence, left Google in 2021 after clashing with management over the release of a powerful chatbot he co-developed.

So, you are throwing people into a very big pressure cooker, and very tragically, some people break, other people are broken,"" Vembu stated, highlighting the convergence of factors contributing to employee stress , particularly in large cities.The Zoho co-founder emphasises the importance of pacing oneself for a long-term career. ""I have been working for 27-28 years, and I hope to work for another 28 if possible. But to do that, I cannot allow myself, or my employees, to burn out,"" he explained in an interview with news agency, PTI.Vembu's solution involves a radical rethinking of corporate structure . He advocates for decentralising operations away from major urban centres, allowing employees to work closer to their homes and communities. This approach, he argues, can alleviate the loneliness and gruelling commutes that often plague young professionals who migrate to big cities for work.""We bring young people from small towns into big cities, and their first challenge is loneliness. Then, they face commutes that can stretch up to two hours each way, particularly in cities like Bengaluru.

Viral response to the Mark Zuckerberg’s interview

Memes history and evolution

Also read

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently offered an interesting and humorous insight into his personal take on memes , the popular digital form of humour that has become ubiquitous across social media platforms. During an interview, Zuckerberg was asked about his favourite meme—a question that led to a candid and lighthearted response from the typically reserved tech leader.In a video shared by Pubity, the text read, “We asked Mark Zuckerberg what his favourite meme is.” Zuckerberg, chuckling at the question, admitted that the memes he had in mind were not “acceptable publicly.” He further referenced a recent viral video, indicating that he stays up-to-date with current trends in online culture.Zuckerberg also took the opportunity to highlight how he uses Meta’s own platforms, such as WhatsApp and Threads , to share memes with his close friends. His acknowledgment of using Meta-owned platforms for personal communication led to amusing commentary from viewers. One viewer remarked, ""Such a wild thought to think bro has group chats with his homies on his own app,"" showcasing the humour around Zuckerberg's everyday use of the very products his company created.The video of Zuckerberg's interview quickly gained traction online, sparking various reactions. While some viewers found his remarks relatable and down-to-earth, others saw his mention of Meta's messaging services as a clever promotion. Zuckerberg’s relaxed approach and genuine enjoyment of memes provided a rare glimpse into his personal life, a side not often shown by high-profile tech leaders.The concept of memes is far from a recent phenomenon. Although they are now synonymous with internet culture, the origins of memes predate the digital age. According to a 2022 report by the New York Times, linguists believe that humans have been using memes for communication for centuries, long before the advent of social media. The term “meme” itself derives from the French word “même,” meaning “same,” and the Greek word “mimoúmai,” which translates to “to imitate.”Memes have always been about imitation and replication, whether in language, culture, or, more recently, through viral digital content. Zuckerberg’s acknowledgement of the power and prevalence of memes further emphasises their role in shaping modern communication, especially on platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp—key services under Meta’s umbrella.","Zuckerberg was asked about his favourite meme in an interview.

Lego, the Denmark-based toy company, faced an unexpected digital crisis when its website fell victim to a cyber attack. Hackers managed to breach the site's security, using the platform to promote fraudulent cryptocurrency schemes. A banner on the website had an illustration of golden coins bearing the company’s logo. It claimed to be ‘ Lego coin ’ which it said was officially out.Users took to microblogging site X (formerly Twitter) to report the incident. Opening the Lego website showed the banner promoting crypto coins and redirected them to a website selling "" LEGO Tokens "" with Ethereum.User ZTBricks @ztbricks wrote in a post: Hey @LEGO_Group someone popped your site and changed the main page! It directs to a crypto site to an account that is almost definitely not you guys!The company responded to the situation. In a statement to Engadget, Lego said that no user accounts were compromised and that it has identified the cause of the issue. It also stated that it was implementing measures to prevent anything similar from happening again in the future. However, the company refused to share details about the ‘cause’ of the breach.On 5 October 2024 (October 4 evening in the US), an unauthorised banner briefly appeared on LEGO.com.

How the US military is using gaming controller-like devices to operate weapons,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-the-us-military-is-using-gaming-controller-like-devices-to-operate-weapons/articleshow/113963673.cms,"Image credit: DVIDS

How the US military has been using FMCUs for other weapons



The US military has been adopting video game controller-like devices to operate its advanced weapons systems for a long time now. Latest images released by the US Department of Defense on the Defence Visual Information Distribution Service website have revealed that variants of the Freedom of Movement Control Unit (FMCU), which resembles Xbox or PlayStation controllers, are being integrated into various weapons platforms.According to the data compiled by federal contracting software GovTribe, Measurement Systems Inc. (MSI), a subsidiary of British defence contractor Ultra is supplying the US military with these FMCUs which are designed to withstand harsh environments.MSI, a longtime developer of joysticks for naval and aircraft systems, has partnered with major defence contractors like General Atomics , Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and BAE Systems to develop these handheld control units for various military programs, the report adds.According to a blog post on DVIDS, the FMCU is being used to control the Navy-Marine Corps Expeditionary Ship Interdiction System (NMESIS) anti-ship missile launcher. The official site of the US Marine Corps claims that NMESIS, which is a Joint Light Tactical Vehicle–based anti-ship missile system is designed to fire the new Naval Strike Missile that’s important to the Marine Corps if there’s a conflict with China in the Indo-Pacific in the coming days.Another report by Task & Purpose claims that the US Army uses similar controller-like devices to operate its Maneuver-Short Range Air Defense (M-SHORAD) system. In a post shared on X (earlier Twitter), a tipster also claimed the same:This system can fire the FIM-92 Stinger and AGM-114 Hellfire missiles and has a 30-mm chain gun mounted on a Stryker infantry fighting vehicle. As per a report by DefenseNews, this system is seen as a critical anti-air capability in a potential clash with Russia in Eastern Europe.Apart from these systems, these controllers-like devices are also used by the US Air Force's Recovery of Air Bases Denied by Ordnance (RADBO) truck for clearing explosives, and the Marine Corps' High Energy Laser-Expeditionary (HELEX) laser weapon system, reports Wired.Another blog post on the DVIDS site claims that FMCU has been employed on other experimental unmanned vehicles. A Navy contract from 2023 is available on the official US govt site SAM.gov that these controllers will also be used to operate the AN/SAY-3A Electro-Optic Sensor System (or “I-Stalker”).A seperate report by the Naval Sea Systems Command claims that this system is designed to help the service’s upcoming Constellation-class guided-missile frigates (small and fast military ships) track and engage incoming threats. The concept of the US Navy’s upcoming Frigate can be found in the US Naval Institute magazine.In a blog post, MSIs’s parent company Ultra explained: “With the foresight to recognise the form factor that would be most accessible to today’s warfighters, [Ultra] has continued to make the FMCU one of the most highly configurable and powerful controllers available today,”A report from 2013 by Military Embedded Systems claims that the US military has been using such controller-like FMCUs in the Navy's MQ-8 Fire Scout drone helicopter and the Ground Based Operational Surveillance System (GBOSS) for a long time.The FMCU being integrated into a wide range of advanced weapons platforms reflects a shifting trend towards user-friendly interfaces that are not only tactile and ergonomic but also familiar to a generation raised on video game controllers.In a statement to Wired, an Air Force spokesman said: “For RADBO, the operators are generally a much younger audience. Therefore, utilising a PlayStation or Xbox type of controller such as the FMCU seems to be a natural transition for the gaming generation.”DVIDS also notes that the US Army and Marine Corps have been using Xbox controllers to operate small unmanned vehicles for more than a decade. Moreover, these controller units were reportedly employed for other systems ranging from explosive ordnance disposal to airborne drones, as well as larger assets like the M1075 Palletized Loading System logistics vehicle.",US military has been adopting video game controller-like devices to operate its advanced weapons systems for a long time now.

How government is tackling fraud calls issue and what citizens can do,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-government-is-tackling-fraud-calls-issue-and-what-citizens-can-do/articleshow/113960242.cms,"Why this advanced system is needed

How is the system helping stop fraud calls

Govt urges citizens to report spam calls using ‘Chakshu’ portal

At a time when citizens are receiving several fraudulent calls, often disguised as originating from Indian mobile numbers, the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) – in collaboration with Telecom Service Providers (TSPs) – has introduced an advanced system. This system is designed to identify and block incoming international spoofed calls before they can reach Indian telecom subscribers.These fraud calls are manipulated by cyber-criminals operating from abroad, and they exploit the Calling Line Identity (CLI) to mask the actual origin of the calls. They call potential victims and accuse them or their relatives of involvement in drug trading, narcotics, and sex rackets – intensifying public concern.The spoofing has also led to a number of incidents involving threats of mobile number disconnection, fake digital arrests and even impersonation of government officials or law enforcement agencies.According to a statement by the Ministry of Communications, the advanced system is being deployed in two phases: first, at the TSP level, to prevent calls spoofed with phone numbers of their own subscribers; and second, at a central level, to stop calls spoofed with the numbers of subscribers from other TSPs.“As of now, all four TSPs have successfully implemented the system. About one third of total spoofed calls at 4.5 million spoofed calls are being stopped from entering the Indian telecom network,” the ministry said.In the next phase, there will be a centralised system that will eliminate the remaining spoofed calls across all TSPs. It is expected to be commissioned shortly.Since fraudsters continue to adapt and devise new methods to deceive the public, the telecom department has urged citizens to report suspected fraud communications to help it in identification and prevention of misuse of telecom resources for cyber-crime, financial frauds .“It will also help in safeguarding citizens from impersonation, exploitation, and enabling proactive action against potential threats,” it added.Citizens can report such calls at Chakshu facility available on the Sanchar Saathi platform (https://sancharsaathi.gov.in/) by providing details about suspected fraud calls, SMS, and WhatsApp messages including screenshot, medium of receipt, category of intended fraud, date and time of receiving such communication.","Fraud calls are manipulated by cyber-criminals operating from abroad.
