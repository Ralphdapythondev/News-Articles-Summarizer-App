Apple Intelligence launch in China may face these three ‘challenges’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-intelligence-launch-in-china-may-face-these-three-challenges/articleshow/111147927.cms,"Tough rules for AI models

Ban on ChatGPT, which will be integrated in Apple devices

Privacy, a core focus for Apple

China has tough rules for AI models

Ban on OpenAI’s ChatGPT in China

Private Cloud Compute

Apple has announced Apple Intelligence , a suite of AI features that will run on iPhones, iPads and Mac PCs. The AI features will be available later this year to users globally, including China – one the most critical markets for the company. However, the company’s big AI push may face some challenges in China as regulators have in place strict rules around the technology amid tough competition.The three challenges that the company may face in China are (via CNBC):China’s AI market is tightly regulated and all companies launching AI models must have approval from the regulators for the commercial use of LLMs. The country has also made it mandatory for Generative AI providers to take down “illegal” content.Since some of the features of Apple Intelligence are developed by the company itself, Apple will likely need to get its AI model approved by authorities under Chinese rules.China has also banned OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Some of Apple’s voice assistant Siri’s capabilities are dependent on ChatGPT. This could mean that Apple may have to find a local AI company that provides the same level of capabilities as ChatGPT. Baidu and Alibaba are among China’s technology giants that have their own LLMs and voice assistants.Apple's AI launch highlighted a focus on user privacy. Their new system, Private Cloud Compute, processes user data on Apple-owned servers, with the company claiming the data itself is not stored.However, in China, Apple's iCloud data is stored on servers located locally and operated by a third party. This may raise concerns about whether Apple can maintain complete control over its AI computing servers in the country.This means that Apple must have a similar partnership for its AI servers in the region to keep user data private.","Apple has announced Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI features that will run on iPhones, iPads and Mac PCs.

"How Nvidia’s ‘new’ hardware plans may be ‘bad news’ for Dell, HPE and others",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-nvidias-new-hardware-plans-may-be-bad-news-for-dell-hpe-and-others/articleshow/111147964.cms,"How Nvidia’s strong position in AI space may help

Nvidia ’s highly in-demand AI chips have boosted the company’s growth, making it the most valuable company in the world. As per a report, the company is now looking to design more hardware for its upcoming chips posing competition to server designers such as Dell , HPE and Supermicro.“Nvidia plans to design server racks for its upcoming GB200 flagship artificial intelligence chips, a job that server designers such as Dell, HPE and Supermicro have long handled,” The Information reported citing two Nvidia employees involved in the plan.The report said that while these server makers have benefited from rising sales of Nvidia chips, the chipmaker’s entry into server space may pressure their profit margins.Nvidia is already holding a lion’s share when it comes to supplying AI chips and the company aims to capitalise on its strong position to “develop new lines of revenue and profits.”“It may make it harder for customers of its chips to switch to alternatives,” the report noted.Earlier this year, Microsoft and Nvidia reportedly disagreed on the design of server racks. While the specific details are not public, it's known that Nvidia eventually dropped its demands.This comes at a time when a report claimed that Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has a growing concern over slowdown of chip sales. Microsoft and Amazon Web Services are among the company’s largest buyers but Huang is worried whether they have enough space to set up data centres, and if not, they may not buy more chips.“Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang called a series of meetings with company executives to discuss a growing concern: whether Nvidia's biggest customers were going to run out of data centre space to install its artificial intelligence chips, which could hurt sales,” the report said, citing a person who attended these meetings.","N Nvidia plans to design server racks for its upcoming GB200 flagship artificial intelligence chips.

Gurugram Police reportedly raided a fraudulent call center in Sector 18, apprehending 11 individuals, including four women. The group is accused of deceiving people by selling fake herbal remedies for improved sexual health .According to a report in news agency IANS, the accused advertised these so-called medicines on Google to lure unsuspecting victims. Once contacted, they would exploit the victims' concerns, tricking them into purchasing useless herbal products. The scam involved additional bogus charges like GST, parking fees, and courier costs. Payments were collected through UPI and QR codes for added legitimacy.Acting on a tip, Gurugram police formulated a special team led by ACP Vipin Alahawat. They raided the location on Thursday, apprehending 11 individuals caught making calls to potential victims.

ReshaMandi , a Bengaluru-based business-to-business (B2B) marketplace specializing in silk yarn products, has laid off 80% of its workforce due to its failure to secure Series B funding. The company has been significantly downsizing its operations since last year.From 500 employees in January 2023 to reportedly around 100 by the end of the year, the company scaled down heavily. And in the process, 300-odd employees are still awaiting their final dues and salaries. According to a report in Inc42, quoting the company's employees, ReshaMandi’s downfall was due to rapid expansion across verticals, immediately before and after it raised funds in October 2021. ""The company fell victim to the growth-at-all-costs mindset, which drove it to inflate revenues in FY23 and FY22. It’s very likely that Temasek and other investors caught wind of the allegations now being raised by employees on social media and in their conversations with us,"" the report further addsFounded in 2020, ReshaMandi raised over $40 million in equity funding from investors such as Creation Investments, Omnivore, Venture Catalysts, and others. Additionally, it secured nearly Rs 300 crore (approximately $25 million) in debt from venture debt investors and lenders. However, the company now faces court cases from creditors and vendors, with some planning to file for insolvency.Despite its previous success, ReshaMandi encountered financial challenges, leading to employee layoffs starting in June 2023. Employees were offered the opportunity to work without salaries for three months, but unfortunately, pending salary payments remain unpaid.ReshaMandi’s full-stack digital ecosystem covers natural fiber from farm to fashion in the agritech space. Notably, it has raised a total of around $70 million in equity and debt funding, with Creation Investments and Omnivore among its backers.The company’s latest funding round, a combination of equity and debt, involved participation from investors like Omnivore, 9 Unicorns, Venture Catalysts, and others. However, despite previous valuations, ReshaMandi’s recent attempt to raise $5 million at a valuation of $25 million was unsuccessful.LegalPay, a tech-based interim financier, highlights that resolving insolvency under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) typically takes 632 days, exceeding the stipulated 270 days. Self-initiation of insolvency has both advantages and risks, including timely action, creditor settlements, but also potential loss of control and asset value.","ReshaMandi, a Bengaluru-based business-to-business (B2B) marketplace specializing in silk yarn products, has laid off 80% of its workforce.

"SIM swap scam: What is it, causes, signs, and tips for prevention",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-tips/sim-swap-scam-what-is-it-causes-signs-and-tips-for-prevention/articleshow/111082258.cms,"SIM swap scams causes

Social engineering: Scammers use various techniques to deceive victims and mobile carrier employees into believing they are the legitimate owner of the phone number. This can involve phishing emails, calls, or text messages to collect personal information.

Data breaches: Large-scale data breaches can provide scammers with the necessary information to impersonate victims. This data can include names, addresses, social security numbers, and phone numbers.

Insider threats: In some cases, scammers may bribe or coerce employees within mobile carrier companies to facilitate the SIM swap.

Weak security practices: Mobile carriers sometimes have insufficient security protocols for verifying identity before transferring a number to a new SIM, making it easier for scammers to execute their schemes.

Signs you might be a victim of a SIM swap scam

Sudden loss of service: If your phone suddenly loses service and displays ""No Service"" or ""Emergency Calls Only,"" it could be a sign that your number has been transferred to another SIM.

Inability to make calls or send texts: If you can no longer make calls or send texts, it might indicate that your SIM card has been deactivated.

Unusual account activity: You might receive notifications of unusual login attempts or password changes from your email, bank, or social media accounts.

Receiving messages about SIM card changes: If you receive notifications from your mobile carrier about SIM card changes that you did not initiate, this is a red flag.

Access denied to accounts: If you are suddenly unable to access your bank accounts, email, or social media accounts despite entering the correct passwords, it could be a result of a SIM swap.

How to protect yourself from SIM swap scams

Enhance account security: Use strong, unique passwords for all online accounts and change them regularly. Avoid using easily guessable information such as birthdays or common words.

Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): Use 2FA methods that do not rely on SMS-based codes. Consider using authenticator apps or hardware tokens instead.

Be wary of phishing attempts: Do not click on links or download attachments from unknown or suspicious emails and messages. Verify the sender's identity before responding.

Monitor your accounts: Regularly check your bank, email, and social media accounts for any suspicious activity. Set up alerts to notify you of any unauthorised transactions or changes.

Contact your mobile carrier: Ask your mobile carrier to add a PIN or password to your account for an extra layer of security. Some carriers also offer the option to disable remote SIM swapping entirely.

Use identity protection services: Consider using identity theft protection services that monitor your personal information and alert you to potential fraud.

Report suspicious activity: If you suspect you are a victim of a SIM swap scam, contact your mobile carrier immediately to restore your service and secure your accounts. Additionally, report the incident to your bank and other relevant institutions.

This allows users to manually choose between the ultra-wide, wide, and telephoto lenses on their device when taking a photo, rather than relying on the camera app to automatically select the appropriate lens.

Pixel Camera 9.4 enhances HDR+ with smarter automatic frame selection, favouring shots where subjects have their eyes open and are smiling.Additionally, the placement of the RAW/JPEG toggle has been moved from an obscure location in the settings to the more easily accessible Pro tab. However, unlike the Pixel 8 Pro, there is no option to adjust the image resolution.While the new version of Pixel Camera is currently available for download, users may not see the new features immediately after installing the update. The additional functionality is expected to be enabled via a server-side update from Google or with the release of the June Pixel Feature Drop .","Google has begun rolling out version 9.4 of its Pixel Camera app. It adds a Pro Lens selection mode and improves the HDR+ functionality on supported Pixel phones.

The order against TCS has been passed in a case filed by Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC), which has merged with DXC Technology Company (DXC), alleging misappropriation of the company's trade secrets before the United States district court.TCS informed the court order to the Stock Exchange Board of India (SEBI) in a BSE filing. It added it will appeal against the court order and file a review petition. ""Pursuant to Regulation 30 of SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, we hereby inform you that the Company has received an adverse judgement passed by United States District Court, Northern District of Texas, Dallas Division, details of which are provided in Annexure A.""Giving details about the lawsuit filed by CSC, the BSE filing says, ""In a suit filed by Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC)/DXC Technology Company (DXC) against the Company, alleging misappropriation of its trade secrets:* The Court ordered that the Company is liable to CSC for $56,151,583 in compensatory damages and $ 112,303,166 in exemplary damages.• The Court also assessed that the Company is liable for $25,773,576.60 in prejudgment interest through June 13, 2024.• The Court also passed certain injunctions and other reliefs against the Company.“The court ordered that the company is liable to CSC for $56,151,583 in compensatory damages and $112,303,166 in exemplary damages,” the Mumbai-basedsoftware services company said in a regulatory filing.Responding to the court ruling, the Tata group company said that the judgement won’t have any major adverse impact on its financials and operations.
