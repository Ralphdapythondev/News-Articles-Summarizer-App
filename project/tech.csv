Swiggy may have a 10-minute ‘answer’ for medicine delivery platforms Tata 1mg and Apollo Pharmacy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/swiggy-may-have-an-answer-for-medicine-delivery-platforms-tata-1mg-and-apollo-pharmacy/articleshow/114599792.cms,"How Swiggy Instamart’s medicine delivery may work



Swiggy is reportedly planning to expand into quick online pharmacy delivery. For this, the food and grocery delivery platform is said to have partnered with online medical delivery PharmEasy. This collaboration will enable Swiggy to offer 10-minute deliveries of medicines, including prescription drugs through its Instamart section. The food delivery platform will reportedly use PharmEasy 's existing infrastructure and regulatory approvals for this.While Swiggy's Instamart already offered basic over-the-counter medicines, this partnership may also allow the company to expand its offerings and tap into a new customer base. According to a report by Moneycontrol, the pilot program is currently underway in Bengaluru and may be planning to expand to other cities in the coming days. This will help the company to compete with other online medicine delivery platforms including Tata’s 1mg and Apollo Pharmacy ’s online platform.With this feature, Swiggy may be able to deliver prescribed medicine to doorsteps in 10 minutes through its Instamart service. Pharmeasy has also reportedly set up stores within Swiggy’s dark stores for the initiative. Swiggy will start delivering medicines like pain relievers, fever medicines as well as medicines that require a valid prescription.“The prescription can either be uploaded by the customer or generated by a doctor during a consultation on Pharmeasy,” a person familiar with the program reportedly noted.This involves a unique ""shop-in-shop"" model within Instamart's dark stores, allowing Swiggy to deliver prescription drugs, a first for quick commerce . This move comes as Swiggy seeks to increase average order values and combat widening losses, despite rising revenue.In Q1 FY24, Swiggy’s losses grew by 8% to Rs 611 crore from Rs 564 crore a year earlier, driven by rising expenses, as detailed in its updated draft red herring prospectus (DRHP). The company’s spending increased by 27% to Rs 3,908 crore, up from Rs 3,073 crore in the same period last year.Meanwhile, revenue from operations rose by 35% to Rs 3,222.2 crore in Q1 FY25, compared to Rs 2,389.8 crore in the same quarter of the previous fiscal year.","Swiggy is reportedly planning to expand into quick online pharmacy delivery.

Xiaomi SU7: The Tesla rival from China

Xiaomi is known for its smartphones. The Chinese giant has been holding a formidable position in the smartphone market in India and China for the past many years now. There now seems another segment where the company may be making a mark --EVs. Xiaomi's EV Xiaomi SU7 has impressed many. An unlikely compliment has now come from none other than the CEO of rival car maker Ford .Ford CEO Jim Farley has expressed admiration for the Xiaomi SU7, a Chinese electric vehicle . Farley, who has been driving the imported SUV for six months, praised its performance and technology integration.The Xiaomi SU7, a sleek sedan reminiscent of a Porsche Panamera, offers impressive specifications. It boasts a top speed of 62 mph in just 2.7 seconds, said to be outperforming the Tesla Model 3. Additionally, it promises a range of 435 miles on a single charge and integrates seamlessly with Xiaomi's smart home ecosystem.Farley's endorsement underscores the rapid advancements in Chinese electric vehicle technology. Companies like Xiaomi and BYD have successfully produced affordable EVs that are both efficient and technologically advanced. This achievement is attributed to factors such as supportive government policies, access to raw materials, and a massive domestic market.However, geopolitical tensions have limited the direct entry of Chinese automakers into the US market. The Biden administration's recent imposition of a 100% tariff on Chinese electric vehicles further exacerbates this challenge.Despite these hurdles, Chinese brands like BYD are expanding their global footprint, targeting developing markets and establishing manufacturing facilities in regions like Brazil. The affordable BYD Seagull EV, priced at around $9,700, demonstrates the potential for disruptive pricing in the electric vehicle market.As the electric vehicle landscape continues to evolve, the competition between US and Chinese automakers is intensifying. While geopolitical factors may hinder direct market access, the influence of Chinese technology and innovation on the global automotive industry is undeniable.","Ford CEO Jim Farley has expressed admiration for the Xiaomi SU7, a Chinese electric vehicle.

"When and why US commerce secretary Gina Raimondo told CEOs of Microsoft, Google and other US companies to buy chips from Intel",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/when-and-why-us-commerce-secretary-gina-raimondo-told-ceos-of-microsoft-google-and-other-us-companies-to-buy-chips-from-intel/articleshow/114598235.cms,"What made US government invest billions in Intel

The mounting troubles of chip giant Intel may be a nightmare for the Biden administration as well. Reason: Intel has been the poster boy for the US Chips Act announced by the US President Joe Biden government in 2022. Intel is the single biggest recipient of federal money from the CHIPS Act, a bipartisan bill aimed at making the United States less reliant on Asia for the tiny electronics that power everything from cars to iPads. Intel is also the sole recipient of a new $3 billion government contract to make advanced chips for the US military.The Biden administration is now said to be facing mounting pressure to revitalize the US semiconductor industry, with a particular focus on Intel.According to a report in New York Times, at an annual gathering of tech executives and billionaires in Sun Valley, Idaho, earlier this year, US commerce secretary Gina Raimondo met with CEOs from Microsoft , Google and other companies and encouraged them to order their semiconductors from the United States, including from Intel. It was important to make more chips in America, she told them, and Intel, the US chip giant, was critical to that effort.Raimondo is reported to have made similar requests in meetings and phone calls over the past year. She has, as per NYT report, urged executives at Apple, Amazon, Nvidia, AMD, Marvell Technology and other companies to consider ordering chips from Intel’s US manufacturing plants.Intel CEO Patrick Gelsinger committed to invest over $100 billion to expand in Arizona, Ohio, New Mexico and Oregon after promises of more than $20 billion in government support. However, Intel’s worsening business has reportedly caused concern in Capitol Hill.Intel CEO said that investments in the United States would proceed, but the company's 15,000 layoffs announced earlier this year and delay in opening of a large factory in Ohio is said to have made government officials anxious. Intel announced its quarterly results in August, its profits saw a disastrous fall and it halted a decades-old shareholder dividend. The company's stock has plummeted more than 20% since the beginning of this year.When Intel project got standing ovation at the US State of the Union addressOhio factory is the project that Biden cited in his State of the Union addresses in 2022 and 2023. In fact, Intel CEO was Biden’s guest at the State of the Union address in 2022. In his speech, US President Biden described a $20 billion project that Intel had planned for Ohio as a “field of dreams” and said that the company would invest $100 billion across the United States.“That would be the biggest investment in manufacturing in American history. And all they’re waiting for is for you to pass this bill,” Biden said to a standing ovation.In an interview to NYT, Raimondo said that her requests for companies to buy Intel chips were part of a push on behalf of all the US manufacturers. “Of course, I’d be doing everything I can to make sure Intel is successful,” she said. “But really, my message to any of these companies, whether it’s Apple or AMD or Nvidia, Amazon, all of them, is we need your demand for U.S.-made chips.“We’re going to get it done, and that is not dependent on any one company,” she added.","Intel has been the poster boy for the US Chips Act announced by the US President Joe Biden government in 2022.

Google’s this $2 billion deal is under scanner,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/googles-this-2-billion-deal-is-under-scanner/articleshow/114591767.cms,"What the companies said about the investigation



“We intend to cooperate with the CMA and provide them with the complete picture about Google’s investment and our commercial collaboration,”

UK CMA also probing AI deal



Google's partnership with artificial intelligence (AI) startup Anthropic is facing a potential hurdle in the UK. The country's competition watchdog has reportedly raised concerns and called for a deeper investigation into the deal. The Competition and Markets Authority ( CMA ) is scrutinising the deal's potential impact on the AI market and innovation. This investigation could delay or even derail the partnership, which involves Google investing in Anthropic and gaining a stake in the company. The Alphabet-owned tech giant has pledged to invest $2 billion into the AI startup last year. Before the investment, Google also signed a major cloud agreement with Anthropic.According to a report by Bloomberg, CMA has said that it’s opening a formal phase one merger probe . This investigation suggests how regulators are taking closer order of the wave of investment into startup AI firms.In a statement to Bloomberg, a Google spokesperson said that Anthropic is free to use multiple cloud providers and it does not demand exclusive tech rights.another Anthropic spokesperson added.Microsoft ’s partnership with OpenAI may also face scrutiny in the UK. Meanwhile, Amazon ’s $4 billion investment in Anthropic was approved in September.In its investigation of Amazon, the CMA found that Anthropic’s revenue in the UK fell below the threshold required to justify intervention. Additionally, the CMA opened and quickly closed probes into Microsoft’s deals with Mistral and Inflection.The CMA has set a deadline of December 19 to determine if a deeper, more detailed investigation is needed for the Microsoft deal.The CMA has been leading efforts to ensure that investments made by major tech firms in the AI sector don’t impact the market dynamics to prevent a few dominant companies from monopolising the industry.Apart from the UK’s CMA, the US Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) and the European Union ( EU ) are also reviewing various AI-related deals.","UK CMA also probing AI deal between Google and Anthropic.

How fraudsters are spreading these fake news about Amitabh Bachchan on Instagram to scam users,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-fraudsters-are-spreading-these-fake-news-about-amitabh-bachchan-on-instagram-to-scam-users/articleshow/114586104.cms,"How these scams work

HE DIDN'T KNOW THE MICROPHONE WAS ON. THIS IS THE END OF HIS CAREER

This is a very sad day for the whole of India!

Goodbye, Amitabh Bachchan

How to safeguard

What Instagram-parent company Meta has to say

If you have come across a post on Instagram that says “A hard day for India: We say goodbye to Amitabh Bachchan ”, do not let your intrigue click the “Learn More” link. It’s a scam! Scammers are using sophisticated techniques to entangle unsuspected users in a fraudulent investment scheme.This scenario is becoming increasingly common as scammers exploit social media platforms like Instagram, Facebook and X to lure unsuspecting users into fraudulent investment schemes using fake celebrity endorsements. Here’s an explainer on how these scams work and how you can be safe.These scams are a version of celebrity scam in which scammers use photos or videos along with catchy headlines to peak users’ interest. These scam often involve fabricated news articles and fictitious interviews where celebrities seemingly endorse dubious platforms or apps promising quick riches.One such scam is prevalent on Instagram in which a photo of Amitabh Bacchan is being used along with a catchy headline. The Times of India tech team came across this scam and found how scammers target users on the social media platform.First an ad in Stories shows a post with Bachchan’s photo and headline:When we clicked the link, it redirected us to another page that looked like an interview in a national daily. The scam involved a fake news article in the form of an interview, fabricated to create an illusion of credibility and legitimacy.The sophisticated scam campaign was using Amitabh Bachchan's image to promote a platform called “Immediate 7.6 Chantix”.“I don't have a second business, but I started earning on the platform Immediate 7.6 Chantix A year ago, I invested only 21 000 rupees and quickly increased my investment. Now, I live on the daily income from this platform,” the article reads, suggesting that this is said by Bachchan.These scams are not limited to celebrities and fraudsters are also using images of other public figures to deceive users.To avoid falling prey to online scams, users should be wary of sensational headlines. The second important thing is to always double-check the website address to ensure it matches the legitimate source. In this case, the link led to a suspicious domain (sisueue.com) instead of the official news site, a clear red flag.The third way is to look for grammatical and spelling errors. There are very few chances of news organisations making such mistakes.According to a report by Moneycontrol, Meta has emphasised their commitment to removing content that violates their policies.“We remove content when we are made aware of it and when it violates our policies whether it was created by AI or a person. Advertisers running ads across Meta technologies must follow our Community Standards and our Advertising Standards. We use automated and, in some instances, manual review to enforce our policies,” a Meta spokesperson said.“Earlier this week, we also announced that we’re testing the use of facial recognition technology to help protect people from celeb-bait ads and enable faster account recovery. We hope that by sharing our approach, we can help inform our industry’s defences against online scammers,” the spokesperson noted.",Scammers are using sophisticated techniques to entangle unsuspected users in a fraudulent investment scheme.

Reliance enters in partnership with Nvidia

The 2024 Nvidia AI Summit in Mumbai saw Bollywood superstar Akshay Kumar rubbing shoulders with Jensen Huang , CEO of AI giant Nvidia. While the summit focused on strengthening India's AI capabilities, their encounter ended with a surprising discussion – martial arts.Kumar, a known martial arts enthusiast, shared a photo on social media X, formerly Twitter, where he and Huang pose playfully in a fighting stance. The caption reads: ""Imagine meeting the world’s biggest authority on Artificial Intelligence and ending up chatting about martial arts!! What an amazing man you are Mr. #JensenHuang. Now I know why @nvidia is the absolute giant that it is. 😊👍🏻""Nvidia's leather-jacket-clad CEO Huang got a rock star welcome at the company's AI summit in India. As a Bloomberg report said, ""The reception Huang received in India's commercial capital Mumbai was reminiscent of the ""Jensanity"" seen in other parts of the world, especially Taiwan, as his popularity climbs with Nvidia's soaring earnings and multi-trillion dollar market valuation.""Huang praised India's rapid digitalisation and its potential in the AI sector. ""Very few countries have this amazing natural resource called IT and computer science expertise,"" he said.The event, where the U.S. company unveiled plans to supply Reliance Industries and other Indian firms with its AI chips, had to be reportedly delayed for more than half an hour due to the crowd that one Nvidia employee said was ""easily a few thousand"".Nvidia CEO Huang and Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani announced a strategic partnership to build state-of-the-art AI infrastructure in India at the summit. The collaboration aims to accelerate India's transformation into a global AI powerhouse by leveraging the nation's vast talent pool and burgeoning digital infrastructure. ""We are among the only countries where the average age of 1.4 billion people is below 35,"" he noted. Ambani emphasised that India's aspirations, combined with the visionary leadership of the Indian Prime Minister, have set the stage for a digital revolution. ""We are at the doorstep of the new intelligence age,"" he said.","Jensen Huang, CEO of AI giant Nvidia, met Bollywood superstar Akshay Kumar.

Industrial conglomerate Siemens AG is reportedly exploring a potential acquisition of Altair Engineering Inc, a leading provider of engineering software . According to a report in Bloomberg, quoting sources familiar with the matter, this move, if finalized, would mark one of Siemens' largest acquisitions to date.The report said that Siemens has been actively working with advisors to assess the feasibility of acquiring Altair, which is headquartered in Troy, Michigan. Altair's stock has seen a significant surge of 27% this year, valuing the company at approximately $9.1 billion. The company has been considering a sale, and Reuters recently reported that Altair was exploring such a move.While discussions are ongoing, there's no guarantee that Siemens will ultimately decide to proceed with the acquisition. Other potential bidders could also emerge for Altair. Representatives from both companies have declined to comment on the matter.Founded by James Scapa, Altair offers a wide range of engineering software solutions to companies across various industries, including aerospace, automotive, energy, and financial services. The growing demand for such tools, driven by the increasing adoption of artificial intelligence, makes Altair a particularly attractive target for Siemens.Under the leadership of CEO Roland Busch , Siemens has been strategically shifting its focus away from heavy equipment businesses and towards higher-margin, software-driven product lines. This strategic shift aligns with the company's aim to catch up to its competitors in the automation industry, such as Rockwell Automation and Schneider Electric.The potential acquisition of Altair would further strengthen Siemens' position in the software market and enhance its capabilities in providing comprehensive engineering solutions to its customers.","Siemens AG is reportedly exploring a potential acquisition of Altair Engineering Inc.

WazirX shares Proof of Reserves

WazirX , the cryptocurrency exchange that suffered a $230-million cyber attack in July this year has released its first Proof of Reserves (POR), revealing a 40.37% plunge in total assets since the hack.

As per it, WazirX's total assets stood at $298.17 million (Rs 2,506.79 crore) as of October 24, spread across 242,000 wallets. This includes $157.01 million in on-chain assets and $126.91 million held with third-party exchanges. An additional $14.25 million remains frozen for ongoing investigations.The latest figures mark a sharp decline from June, when WazirX reported total holdings of $503.64 million (Rs 4,203.88 crore) – which was itself a 79 percent increase from January 2023.Earlier reports from CoinSwitch had indicated that WazirX moved significant funds to other exchanges, including $72.13 million to Bybit and $1.5 million to KuCoin.Here’s what WazirX said about the proofAt WazirX, we have always valued transparency and trust.

A one-hour video recording of a ""digital arrest"" scam has gone viral, offering a glimpse into the tactics employed by these fraudsters. The video, featuring a journalist targeted by the scammers, serves as a warning for the public to remain vigilant against such online threats.An investigative journalist from Gujarat posted a series of videos on X (formerly known as Twitter) to warn the people about digital arrest scam . Gamers received a WhatsApp call from scammers informing him that his phone number is being misused. “First I received a call from an unknown number informing me that my mobile numbers would be blocked in the next four hours as they were being used for harassment and financial fraud. Scammers make this call in the name of Telecom Regularity of India (TRAI),” posted Gamers.The caller asked Gajera to either reach the Lucknow police station within 12 hours or register his statement via WhatsApp video call. Gamers selected the second option and then a scammer, disguised as a police officer, appeared in a setting resembling a police station. Gajera astutely noted that this tactic is a common ploy used by scammers, as it's during the video call that victims are most likely to believe the legitimacy of the threat.The scammer, posing as a police officer, informed Gajera that his Aadhaar details and phone number had been misused in illegal activities. The scammer then attempted to manipulate Gajera into filing a complaint while keeping him on the line.The scammer falsely accused Gajera of being involved in 17 harassment cases. To further their deception, they shared a forged document purportedly issued by the Supreme Court and TRAI, naming Gajera as a suspect. “Next, he started to inquire about whether I use UPI apps or net banking so they can use this mode to transfer the amount. In the end, the scammer police officer gives this case to DCP. He informed me that I needed to transfer all the money I had in my bank accounts, which would be returned if I was found innocent, and they would give me a certificate!” added Gajera.For an hour and a half, Gajera was held captive in a virtual ""digital arrest,"" unable to terminate the call or leave his phone. He intentionally endured the ordeal to document the scam and share it online, aiming to alert others about this dangerous tactic.The video also explains that how the scammers employ a variety of tactics to create an air of legitimacy, including:* Fake Aadhaar card: The scammers display a fake Aadhaar card, a crucial Indian identity document, supposedly linked to a criminal case against the victim.* Forged legal documents: They brandish a fabricated letter purportedly from the Supreme Court, further escalating the perceived threat.* Misuse of symbols of authority: They wear a police uniform on camera and display the Indian flag in the background, attempting to project an aura of officialdom.","An investigative journalist from Gujarat posted a series of videos on X (formerly known as Twitter) to warn the people about digital arrest scam.

Perplexity, the artificial intelligence (AI) startup is facing a lawsuit over alleged copyright infringement . Filed by Dow Jones and the New York Post , the lawsuit claims that the startup engages in a ""massive amount of illegal copying"" of their copyrighted work. It alleges that Perplexity did not respond to a letter sent by the two news publishers in July, notifying it of the legal issues raised by its unauthorized use of copyrighted works, and offering to discuss a potential licensing deal.In a blog post, the company said that it is both “disappointed and surprised” by the lawsuit. It said that the facts alleged in the complaint are misleading at best. “They are disingenuous in their description of what happened even in the specific cited instances, as well as in their broader depiction of what Perplexity is for (spoiler alert: it’s not for reprising the full text of articles that can be more directly and efficiently obtained elsewhere). And the suggestion that we never responded to outreach from News Corp . is simply false: they reached out; we responded the very same day; instead of continuing the dialogue, they filed this lawsuit.”“Second, we have learned in the short time since this lawsuit was filed, a disturbing trend in these types of cases: The companies that are suing make all kinds of salacious allegations in their complaints about all kinds of seemingly bad things they were able to coax the AI tools to do—and then, when pressed in the litigation for details of things like how they achieved such obviously unrepresentative results, they immediately disavow the very examples they put in the public record, and swear they won’t actually use them in the case. We presume that is what will happen here. And that will tell you everything you need to know about the strength of their case,” it added.Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas , speaking at WSJ Tech Live conference said that he was ""surprised"" by the lawsuit.","Dow Jones and New York Post filed a lawsuit against AI startup Perplexity.

A fateful boardroom decision in 2005 saw Intel pass up the opportunity to acquire Nvidia for $20 billion, a move that would prove costly as Nvidia later became the dominant force in artificial intelligence chips, the New York Times reported.Then-CEO Paul Otellini presented the acquisition proposal to Intel's board of directors, with some executives believing graphics chip designs could play a crucial role in data centres. The board rejected the idea, citing Intel's poor track record of integrating acquired companies and the unprecedented price tag, according to people familiar with the confidential meeting.Today, Nvidia's market value exceeds $3 trillion, while Intel's has fallen below $100 billion. The company that once dominated Silicon Valley's chip industry is now getting ""no lift from the A.I. gold rush,"" the Times noted.After rejecting the Nvidia purchase, Intel pursued an internal project called Larrabee , led by current CEO Patrick Gelsinger . The four-year effort to create a hybrid graphics chip using Intel's PC-style design consumed hundreds of millions of dollars before being cancelled in 2009 due to lagging performance.""I believed in it,"" Gelsinger told the Times in a recent interview. ""Had Intel kept at it, I think the world would be very different today.""Intel made subsequent attempts to enter the AI chip market, including purchasing Nervana Systems for $400 million in 2016 and Habana Labs for $2 billion in 2019. However, these investments failed to secure Intel a significant position in the AI chip market.The company's latest AI chip, Gaudi 3, is marketed as a lower-cost alternative to Nvidia's products. However, Gelsinger acknowledges Intel won't compete with Nvidia in high-end AI systems anytime soon, telling a recent Deutsche Bank conference, ""In that race, they are so far ahead... we're just not going to be competing anytime soon.""The missed opportunity has contributed to speculation among tech companies and investment bankers about what was once unthinkable: that Intel could become an acquisition target itself.","Intel passed up opportunity to acquire Nvidia for $20 billion in 2005.

Taking over Rishta aunties -- the traditional matchmakers

Dating apps banned in Pakistan

In Pakistan , where traditional matchmakers, or "" Rishta Aunties ,"" have long played a pivotal role in arranging marriages, a new wave of digital disruption is challenging the established norms. Marriage apps , specifically designed for Muslims, are offering women an alternative path to finding a husband.Ezza Nawaz, a textile designer from Lahore, shared her experience with AFP, stating, ""When I saw my colleague happy after being married to someone she met online... I thought, since we have tried rishta aunties for four or five years, let's try this too.""Rishta aunties traditionally act as intermediaries, presenting women to potential suitors' families. However, marriage apps like Muzz have emerged in recent years, promising ""love matches"" and offering features like ""chaperone"" options to address family concerns.Ezza's experience with Muzz was positive, leading to her marriage to Waseem Akhtar within three months.Arranged marriages continue to dominate Pakistan's marriage landscape, with over 80% of Pakistanis opting for this tradition. Families often play a central role in deciding unions, sometimes even without the bride and groom meeting beforehand.Rishta aunties are instrumental in finding suitable matches, often focusing on physical appearance and other traditional criteria. However, marriage apps like Muzz have gained popularity, attracting over 1.2 million users in Pakistan and facilitating over 15,000 marriages.These apps position themselves as ""halal,"" adhering to Islamic principles, offering features like blurred profile pictures and a clear focus on marriage proposals. Despite their popularity, they still face stigma associated with casual dating apps. Pakistan has banned dating apps like Tinder and others. In October 2022, Pakistan prohibited Tinder, Grindr, Tagged, Skout, and SayHi citing “immoral” and “indecent” content.The concept of marriage in Pakistan is deeply ingrained in the cultural fabric, often viewed as a union of two families. Choosing one's own spouse can challenge traditional family structures and the reverence for elders.Rishta aunties remain a cornerstone of the marriage market, offering services such as teaching young women how to walk, talk, and dress to impress potential in-laws. Many traditional matchmakers, like Fauzia Aazam, still reject marriage apps, preferring the in-person approach.Feminist author Aisha Sarwari believes the matchmaking process can be a tool for exercising control over daughters-in-law. She emphasizes the need for a balanced approach that respects individuals without compromising traditional values.Aneela, a digital media artist, faced challenges when using a marriage app, including encountering men who lied about their identities. She eventually resorted to using a fake name and profile to protect her privacy.","Traditional matchmakers, or "" Rishta Aunties,"" have long played a pivotal role in arranging marriages in Pakistan.
