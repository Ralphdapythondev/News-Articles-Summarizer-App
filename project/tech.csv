Other accessibility updates Google is offering



Google launched new accessibility features across its products and services earlier this week at the Global Accessibility Awareness Day . As a part of these updates, the tech giant has upgraded its Lookout tool on Android which helps people with low vision to find out more information about their surroundings. Google is using AI and adding the ability for Lookout to search for specific objects, including seating, bathrooms, and more, making up seven total categories.Google is rolling out a Find mode in beta version which offers a new way to find specific objects.Users can select from seven categories of items — like seating and tables or bathrooms — then as they move their camera around the room, Lookout will notify them of the direction and distance to the item.Earlier this year, AI-generated image captions became available on Lookout globally in English. Now if someone captures a photo directly within the app, they’ll receive an AI-generated description of the image and learn more about the images they take.Android’s Look to Speak app allows users to select pre-written, customisable phrases with their eyes, which are then read aloud by their device. Now, the app will support a text-free mode. The company said that this is intended “to help make communicating more accessible with cognitive differences, literacy challenges and language barriers.”Google’s Project Gameface enables people to control a computer’s cursor using head movements and facial gestures. This tool is now expanding from PC to Android. Developers will now be able to start tapping into it through GitHub.Apart from this, Google is also adding some other accessibility features. For example, businesses can now designate in their Google Maps profile that they support Auracast-enabled Bluetooth devices.This can receive audio from broadcast devices at theatres, auditoriums, or gyms. Google Maps’ detailed voice guidance for walking directions is also expanding “to Android and iOS globally in all supported languages.”The company has also redesigned its sound notifications, which can alert people of noises like fire alarms.","Google is rolling out a Find mode in beta version which offers a new way to find specific objects.

BYOAI is the new workplace trend



What leaders think about using AI in the workplace



2024 marks the year when artificial intelligence (AI) in the workplace becomes a reality. According to the 2024 Work Trend Index Annual Report from Microsoft and LinkedIn, the use of generative AI has nearly doubled in the past six months with 75% of global knowledge workers now utilising the technology. As per the report, 92% of knowledge workers in India are also using generative AI at work.The report claims that the employees are also independently introducing AI tools into their workflows to grapple with the increasing pace and volume of work. 72% of Indian AI users are bringing their own AI (BYOAI) to work, the report adds.However, leaders have recognised AI as a business imperative and many feel their organisations lack a clear plan and vision to transition from individual benefits to leveraging AI for significant business impact. The pressure to demonstrate immediate ROI is causing hesitation among leaders, despite the undeniable inevitability of AI.AI is being integrated into the workplace at an unprecedented scale. Currently, 3 out of 4 knowledge workers globally use AI in their daily tasks, with 46% having adopted it in the past six months. The report claimsFor instance, the most active Teams users (the top 5%) used Copilot to summarize 8 hours of meetings in March alone, equating to an entire workday.Without top-level guidance, employees are discreetly bringing their own AI tools to work, with 78% of AI users engaging in this practice, especially at small and medium-sized companies (80%). The report also claims that this trend spans all generations.Over half of AI users (52%) are hesitant to disclose using AI for important tasks, fearing it makes them appear replaceable (53%). This hidden AI use means missing out on strategic benefits and risks to company data, with cybersecurity being a top concern.The report claims that workload pressures are driving this behaviour, as 68% struggle with the pace and volume of work, leading to burnout. Communication tasks dominate the workday, with 85% of emails read in under 15 seconds.While most leaders have recognised AI as essential, the pressure for immediate return on investment (ROI) causes hesitation. 79% believe AI is crucial for competitiveness, but 59% are concerned about measuring its productivity gains.This uncertainty hinders strategic planning, with 60% fearing their leadership lacks a clear AI implementation vision. Leaders familiar with AI see its potential for transformation, expecting to redesign business processes and manage AI bots within five years.They also foresee ensuring ethical AI use as a key responsibility. As employees overwhelmed by digital workloads turn to AI for relief, leaders have the opportunity to harness this momentum into tangible ROI.For this report, Microsoft and surveyed 31,000 people across 31 countries and identified the labour and hiring trends from LinkedIn. The company also analysed trillions of Microsoft 365 productivity signals as well as did research with Fortune 500 customers for this report.",90% of users reported that AI helps them save time. 72% of Indian AI users are bringing their own AI (BYOAI) to work.

ChatGPT recently got an upgrade as OpenAI launched the GPT-4o AI model that can allow users to interact with AI via text, voice and vision. While the Microsoft-backed company is yet to roll out the full capabilities of the new model, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has found a “surprisingly cool thing” about the chatbot.Altman discussed a use case on The Logan Bartlett Show podcast episode released last week.He said that he has had the opportunity to use GPT-4o for a week but found that he can ask the chatbot on his phone without having to interrupt his workflow.“I've only had it for like a week or something,” said Altman, who has led OpenAI since 2019. He said that one way of using it is ""putting my phone on the table while I'm really in the zone of working, and then, without having to change windows or change what I'm doing, using it as like another channel."" he said.“So I'm working on something, I would normally stop what I'm doing, switch to another tab, Google something, click around or whatever, but while I'm still doing it, to just ask and get an instant response without changing from what I was looking at on my computer, that's been a surprisingly cool thing,” he explained.Altman also spoke about the downsides of being a prominent figure in the tech industry. He said his privacy in San Francisco has vanished, making it impossible to dine out publicly.“It's a strangely isolating way to live,” he said.

Google is supercharging its AI Assistant with the Gemini language model . At the annual Google I/O event, the company launched Gemini Live – a new conversational experience on Gemini that, along with various tools, will allow the AI assistant to take action on users’ behalf.It will be available in Google Messages , allowing users to chat with Gemini directly within the messaging app.In the coming months, Google is launching Live for Gemini Advanced subscribers.“We think a personal AI assistant should be able to solve complicated problems, take actions for you, and also feel natural when you converse with it. My Gemini should be really different from your Gemini,” said Sissie Hsiao, vice president and general manager, Gemini Experiences and Google Assistant .Gemini Live is essentially a new mobile conversation experience but is similar to Google Assistant. It leverages advanced speech technology to create a more natural conversational experience so that the talking session doesn’t seem robotic.Live allows users to speak with Gemini and select from various natural-sounding voices for its responses. Users can speak at their own pace and interrupt mid-response with clarifying questions, mirroring natural conversation.For example, imagine preparing for a job interview. Users can activate Live and request interview preparation assistance from Gemini. Gemini can conduct mock interviews and even suggest skills to highlight when speaking with potential employers.People can choose from 10 different natural-sounding voices as well as the tone and style of their preference.Later this year, users will be able to use their camera during Live sessions, enabling conversations about the user's surroundings.",Gemini Live is a new mobile conversation experience but is similar to Google Assistant.

Google accidentally 'deletes' $125 billion accounts holding pension funds from Cloud; CEO issues rare apology,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-accidentally-deletes-125-billion-account-holding-pension-funds-from-cloud-ceo-says-sorry/articleshow/110135841.cms,"Here's the joint statement:

UniSuper and Google Cloud understand the disruption to services experienced by members has been extremely frustrating and disappointing. We extend our sincere apologies to all members.

While supporting UniSuper to bring its systems back online, Google Cloud has been conducting a root cause analysis.

Google Cloud CEO, Thomas Kurian has confirmed that the disruption arose from an unprecedented sequence of events whereby an inadvertent misconfiguration during provisioning of UniSuper’s Private Cloud services ultimately resulted in the deletion of UniSuper’s Private Cloud subscription.

This is an isolated, ‘one-of-a-kind occurrence’ that has never before occurred with any of Google Cloud’s clients globally. This should not have happened. Google Cloud has identified the events that led to this disruption and taken measures to ensure this does not happen again.

Why did the outage last so long?

UniSuper had duplication in two geographies as a protection against outages and loss. However, when the deletion of UniSuper’s Private Cloud subscription occurred, it caused deletion across both of these geographies.

Restoring UniSuper’s Private Cloud instance has called for an incredible amount of focus, effort, and partnership between our teams to enable an extensive recovery of all the core systems. The dedication and collaboration between UniSuper and Google Cloud has led to an extensive recovery of our Private Cloud which includes hundreds of virtual machines, databases and applications.

UniSuper had backups in place with an additional service provider. These backups have minimised data loss, and significantly improved the ability of UniSuper and Google Cloud to complete the restoration.

What’s next?

UniSuper and Google Cloud have been working around the clock on a resolution. The completion of the restoration swiftly, safely and securely remains Google Cloud and UniSuper’s top priority.

Australian pension fund UniSuper members faced a week-long outage due to an accidental deletion of their private cloud account by Google Cloud . This impacted over half a million people who couldn't access their superannuation accounts.Service restoration has begun, but it might take some time for investment balances to reflect current figures. UniSuper assured members that they are working on a swift update.UniSuper CEO, Peter Chun, reached out to members via email.He clarified that the incident wasn't a cyberattack and there was no case of data breach either. Chun pinpointed a Google Cloud configuration error as the reason behind the outage.The outage reportedly lasted for an extended period of time as the subscription was deleted, taking with it UniSuper's two geographies that were intended to provide protection against outages and loss. Fortunately, UniSuper had backups in place with a different service provider. UniSuper is said to have moved a large amount of its workloads to Google Cloud Platform in 2023, having previously split them between Azure and two of its own data centers.In a rare move, UniSuper and Google Cloud issued a joint apology. In a joint statement with UniSuper CEO Peter Chun , Google CEO Thomas Kurian admitted that an ""inadvertent misconfiguration"" during the provisioning of UniSuper's Private Cloud services resulted in the deletion of the data.","Australian pension fund UniSuper members faced a week-long outage due to an accidental deletion of their private cloud account by Google Cloud.

Android 15 beta 2 is now available for Google Pixel 6 onwards, OnePlus 12, iQoo 12, and these other phones

Google has announced Android 15 , releasing the beta 2 to developers. The new iteration of Android comes with several new improvements, from enhanced privacy and security to improved performance. Here are the 15 new features that will come to Android phones later this year.Android 15 introduces a plethora of changes, including a bunch of new features like Private Space , Theft Protection , among others.Let's go the 15 of new features that Google announced for Android 15.Android 15 introduces Private Space, a secure, encrypted area within your phone where you can hide and lock away sensitive apps. This feature provides an extra layer of authentication, ensuring that your personal information, such as banking or health data, remains protected from prying eyes.Android 15 bolsters theft protection with features like upgraded factory reset protection, which prevents thieves from resetting and selling your stolen phone without your Google account credentials. The OS will also detect suspicious activities, such as attempts to disconnect your phone or multiple failed log-in attempts, and automatically lock the device to deter theft.Under the hood, Android 15 brings numerous efficiency improvements to optimise app performance and battery life. Foreground services now have a 6-hour limit on dataSync and media processing, pushing them to the background after the time limit to conserve power. The introduction of 16KB page support reduces power draw during app launch and improves camera app opening speed.For users with larger-screen devices like the Pixel Tablet, Android 15 offers enhanced multitasking capabilities. Pin the taskbar, quickly switch between apps, and save preferred split-screen combinations for a seamless navigation experience.Android 15's Predictive Back feature uses animations to show users exactly where the back button will take them, eliminating the frustration of accidentally navigating to the wrong screen. Apps can now provide a Remote View to the Widget Picker, allowing users to preview widgets before placing them on their home screens.Android 15 extends platform support for satellite connectivity, providing a consistent user experience across the satellite connectivity landscape. Apps can now detect when a device is connected to a satellite, giving them more awareness of why complete network services may be unavailable. SMS and RCS apps can also send and receive messages via satellite connectivity.Android 15 introduces app archiving, a feature that allows users to free up storage space by offloading most of an app while retaining user settings and saving data. This feature will be accessible through the Settings app, making it easy for users to manage their device storage.Android 15 upgrades the Find My Device feature, allowing users to locate items like keys, wallets, or luggage using Bluetooth tracker tags from various manufacturers. This enhancement makes it easier for users to keep track of their belongings and find them quickly when misplaced.The Health Connect platform in Android 15 now supports additional health and fitness data types, such as skin temperature and training plans, enabling more comprehensive tracking and analysis.Android 15 introduces new extensions that give developers more control over camera hardware on supported devices. Low-light enhancements give developers control over boosting the brightness of the camera preview, while advanced flash strength adjustments enable precise control of flash intensity when capturing photos.With Android 15, users can share or record just an app window rather than the entire device screen. This feature, previously enabled on Pixel devices, will now be available across the broader Android platform, ensuring that sensitive information remains private during screen-sharing sessions.Android 15 brings several improvements to notifications and customization. Users can now set rich vibrations for incoming notifications by channel, allowing them to distinguish between different types of notifications without looking at their devices. The OS also introduces a new ""colour contrast"" settings page, enabling users to adjust the contrast of text, buttons, and icons in apps for better visibility.There is a new Bluetooth Quick Settings tile that lets users toggle individual connections to connect and disconnect specific devices. The OS also supports the CTA-2075 loudness standard, helping app developers avoid loudness inconsistencies and ensuring users don't have to adjust volume when switching between content constantly.Soon, Google Maps will enable users to access augmented reality (AR) content directly on their phones, providing immersive ways to learn about locations. AR experiences for places like Singapore and Paris are in the works, laying the foundation for an extended reality (XR) platform.Android 15 Beta 2 is now available on these phones – Google Pixel 6 onwards, OnePlus 12, OnePlus 12, Vivo X100, iQoo 12, Nothing 2(a), and select phones from Honor, Lenovo, Nothing, OnePlus, OPPO, Realme, Sharp, Tecno, and Xiaomi.The stable release of Android 15 is expected in late summer or early fall, possibly coinciding with the launch of the Pixel 9 series.","Google has announced Android 15, releasing the beta 2 to developers.

Phone condition: Assess the physical condition of the phone. Look for scratches, dents, or other signs of wear. Check the screen for cracks and ensure all buttons and ports function correctly.

Age of the phone: Determine how old the phone is and consider its release date. Older models may lack software updates and compatibility with newer apps.

Battery health: Battery life is crucial for a smooth user experience. Inquire about the battery health and ask for details on its capacity and degradation over time.

Software updates: Ensure the phone is compatible with the latest software updates from the manufacturer. Older devices may not receive updates, which can impact security and functionality.

Network compatibility: Confirm that the mobile phone is unlocked or compatible with your network carrier. Some phones are locked to specific carriers, limiting your options.

IMEI check: Verify the phone's IMEI number to ensure it's not stolen or blacklisted. This step helps prevent buying a phone with legal issues or unpaid bills.

Performance testing: Test the phone's performance by running apps, browsing the internet, and checking the camera quality. Look for lagging or freezing issues.

Storage capacity: Determine the phone's storage capacity and assess whether it meets your needs for storing photos, videos, and apps.

Price comparison: Research the market value of the phone model you're interested in. Compare prices from different sellers to ensure you're getting a fair deal.

Sam Altman , CEO of OpenAI , has been on a rollercoaster the last few years. Since the company's release of ChatGPT, he's widely regarded as the poster boy of Generative-AI world. He's met with world leaders, clashed with Elon Musk , and even joined the billionaire club. Amidst all this, he also got fired (briefly) from the company he co-founded.On a recent tech podcast ""The Logan Bartlett Show"", Altman said with a laugh that if he had more time to reflect, ""every day would have something crazy."" However, one truly surreal moment stands out: His four-day ousting from OpenAI.As reported by Business Insider, it wasn't the firing itself that was unreal. It was how he handled this bizarre situation. Altman described it as an ""insane, superjammed"" 4 ½ days where his body was in an ""adrenaline-charged state.""Within a day of being fired, world leaders started texting. He received messages from 10-20 presidents and prime ministers. He said it felt normal at the time, and he even thanked them without batting an eye.""It was just weird,"" Altman admitted. He barely slept or ate, but his focus and energy were off the charts.Once he got his job back, reality hit him. Stopping at a diner, he realized he hadn't eaten in days. Naturally, he celebrated with a feast: four ""heavy"" meals and two milkshakes (just for him!).The celebratory meal was great, but the real shocker came later. A president texted him, relieved things were settled.Suddenly, Altman realized how bizarre it all was. World leaders texting him during his firing shouldn't have felt normal, but it did. It showed him just how adaptable humans are.""We can get used to anything as the new normal, good or bad, pretty fast,"" Altman said. He sees this as a strength – humans can adapt to almost anything.""My takeaway is human adaptability to almost anything is just, like, much more remarkably strong than we realize,"" Altman said on the podcast. ""And you can get used to anything as the new normal, good or bad, pretty fast.""","Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, has been on a rollercoaster the last few years.
