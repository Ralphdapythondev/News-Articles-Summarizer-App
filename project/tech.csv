Google Messages is offering you more control over your texting experience . The tech giant has started rolling out a new update for Google Messages which introduces a new setting: ""Show expressive animations ."" This feature allows you to decide whether you want to see the playful animations and effects that have been popping up in your chats.Previously, Google Messages added features like animated emoji , screen effects(think celebratory fireworks after a big announcement), and reaction effects (where your thumbs up emoji literally gives a thumbs up). The new ""Show expressive animations"" setting caters to this preference. With a simple toggle, you can choose between:* A fully animated experience: Keep all the emoji movements, screen flourishes, and reaction dances.* A more classic texting feel: Turn off the animations altogether and see just the static emoji and text.* You can tailor your messaging experience to your liking. Want a lively chat experience? Keep the animations on. Prefer a cleaner, text-focused look? Turn them off – it's your call.* For those who find the animations overwhelming, this update allows for a more focused messaging experience.* While minimal, disabling animations might have a slight positive impact on battery life .It's important to note that some features, like the animation on photomoji (those emoji portraits you create of yourself), are still available even with animations turned off. Additionally, emoji reactions you leave on messages might still display some minimal animation.","Google Messages is rolling out a new ""Show expressive animations"" setting.

Jio spent the least in 5G spectrum auction

Reliance Jio has acquired additional spectrum in the 1800MHz band in Bihar and West Bengal in the 5G spectrum auction conducted by the Department of Telecommunications (DoT). With this acquisition, Jio has expanded its 1800MHz band spectrum in two circles, increasing the spectrum footprint to 26,801 MHz (uplink + downlink).Jio is the only operator in India to have access in low-band, mid-band and high-band (700 MHz, 3300 MHz and 26GHz) spectrum.On the acquisition, Akash M Ambani , chairman, Reliance Jio Infocomm Limited, has said that this will help the company to fulfil the growing traffic demands and superior customer experience.“We have already demonstrated our commitment to the Digital India Vision by rolling out one of the world’s fastest and widest Stand Alone 5G networks within 12 months of allotment of spectrum,” Ambani said.“This new spectrum acquisition will continue to enable us to serve the aspirations of the new India, in terms of growing traffic demands and superior customer experience, which is no longer limited to only urban markets. We want every Indian to enjoy the transformational benefits of Jio’s next generation of digital solutions,” he added..It is to be noted that Jio has already deployed the largest amount of spectrum pan-India on bandwidth efficient technologies like 4G and 5G.Jio spent less than its counterparts – Airtel and Vi – to mainly buy spectrum in the 1800 MHz band to improve its 4G and 5G coverage.For Bihar circle, it spent Rs 420.25 crore and for West Bengal circle, Jio shelled Rs 553.38 crore for a total of Rs 973.63 crore.

Nikesh Arora secured second spot on The Wall Street Journal's 2023 list

Leading one of the world’s top technology companies does not guarantee that you are the highest earning CEO. A report has listed the top 10 CEOs on the basis of Compensation Actually Paid (CAP) to them. The list also has only one Indian-origin CEO – and it's neither Microsoft chief Satya Nadella nor Google’s top executive Sundar Pichai .Nikesh Arora , chairman and chief executive officer of Palo Alto Networks , stands as the sole Silicon Valley executive of Indian descent to be included on the list of the ten highest-paid CEOs in the US, according to a report from C-Suite Comp .Interestingly, Pichai and Nadella did not make it to the list despite their companies’ stellar performance with AI boost.The list shows two matrices: “Disclosed total compensation” in 2023 and “compensation actually paid.” Arora’s disclosed total compensation was over $151.4 million in 2023, and he is placed on the 10th spot in the list with a total compensation actually paid of over $266.4 million.Arora is an alumnus of Delhi's Air Force Public School and was Google's chief business officer. After leaving Google in 2014, he led SoftBank in Japan and since 2018, he's been steering Palo Alto Networks, a cybersecurity firm.The list is topped by Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who earned over $1.4 billion in 2023. Alexander Karp of Palantir Technologies earned over $1.1 billion. Here’s the full list:Arora secured the number two spot on The Wall Street Journal's 2023 list of highest-paid CEOs in the US with total compensation reaching $151.43 million, primarily from stock options.The report highlighted the strong presence of Indian-descent executives among high earners with 17 making it to the top 500. Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen – another Indian-origin executive – followed at number 11 with $44.93 million.Musk and Pichai (also India-born) opted for non-traditional compensation structures in 2023 with Musk receiving no reported compensation and Pichai earning $8.80 million. Meanwhile, Facebook co-founder and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg brought in $24.40 million.","The list is topped by Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who earned over $1.4 billion in 2023.

Reliance Jio bid for least amount of spectrum

Vodafone-Idea spends second-highest on buying 5G spectrum

The government is likely to have mopped up a modest over Rs 11,300 crore from second 5G spectrum sale, which ended after seven rounds around 11.30 am Wednesday (June26) — lasting just over a day. The total bids received is more or less the same, as what came in on Tuesday (June 25), sources said, adding only 140-150MHz are estimated to have been sold.The final revenue mop-up for the government is well below the record Rs 1,50,173 crore collected in the July 2022 sale of 5G airwaves and even below the Rs 77,814 crore in the March 2021 4G auction. The government had offered a total of 10 GHz of spectrum ranging between 800 MHz to 26 GHz, which was worth Rs 96,238 crore at the base or auction start price.However, only a small amount of the spectrum on offer got sold in seven rounds of auction. In all, available spectrum in 800 MHz, 900 MHz, 1,800 MHz, 2,100 MHz, 2,300 MHz, 2,500 MHz, 3,300 MHz, and 26 GHz bands were put to auction. Of these, 900 MHz, 1,800 MHz, 2,100 MHz and 2,500 MHz bands caught telcos' fancy.""Spectrum auction 2024 was part of a continuous allocation process that is transparent, robust and progressive. Telecom service providers (TSPs) have taken spectrum not only for continuity of service but for expanding their services but the volume is limited because already a large part of the spectrum required was auctioned only last year,"" said Communications Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia . He added, ""We will continue the process with the clear objective of ensuring reliability and growth of telecom services in India.""Bharti Airtel emerged as the top buyer of airwaves. Airtel bid and won airwaves worth Rs 6,856.76 crore. The company bought 97 MHz of radio frequency for mobile services for Rs 6,856.76 crore. Gopal Vittal, MD and CEO of Bharti Airtel, said that the company continues to judiciously acquire the right amount of spectrum to deliver the best possible experience to its customers. ""In this auction, we have bolstered our sub-giga hertz and mid-band holding which will significantly improve our coverage especially indoor,"" Vittal said.Mukesh Ambani 's Reliance Jio got Rs 973.62 crore worth of spectrum -- the least in the three-corner contest. A statement by Jio said that the company has consolidated its leadership position by acquiring the right to use spectrum in the 1,800 MHz band in the circles of Bihar and West Bengal.Akash M Ambani, Chairman, Reliance Jio Infocomm , said the company has already demonstrated its commitment to the Digital India vision by rolling out one of the world's fastest and widest stand-alone 5G networks within 12 months of allotment of spectrum. ""This new spectrum acquisition will continue to enable us to serve the aspirations of the new India, in terms of growing traffic demands and superior customer experience, which is no longer limited to only urban markets,"" Ambani said.Vodafone Idea, the struggling telecom operator that recently got a fresh lease of life through India's biggest follow on share sale, bagged spectrum valued Rs 3,510.4 crore. The company bought 30 Mhz of spectrum. ""Akshaya Moondra, CEO, Vodafone Idea, said the company has strategically acquired spectrum in the select markets to enhance and strengthen its overall spectrum portfolio.

Tensions rise in the space industry as Blue Origin, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos ' rocket company, raises environmental concerns about Tesla CEO Elon Musk 's SpaceX . Blue Origin filed a complaint with the US airspace regulator Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to potentially limit Starship launches at Cape Canaveral, Florida. In simple words, Bezos' Blue is requesting the FAA that it limits the number of launches the Musk-led company can perform in Florida.This request coincides with the FAA's preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for Starship's Super Heavy booster, planned for launch from the Kennedy Space Center.The massive Starship system, still under development, has only achieved limited success in its four test flights. A past launch caused intense heat and pressure, likened to a volcanic eruption, and showered nearby areas with debris. However, upon completion, Starship will be the most powerful launch system ever built.Blue Origin's main concern revolves around the Super Heavy booster's massive fuel capacity (5,200 metric tons of liquid methane) which, they argue, creates safety hazard zones potentially impacting surrounding areas, including Blue Origin's facilities and government operations.Bezos' company argues that Starship's environmental impact could be significant compared to existing systems at Kennedy Space Center. Blue Origin urges the FAA to consider limiting the frequency of Starship launches, landing operations, and other activities to minimize environmental disruption. Though a specific launch cap wasn't proposed.The proximity of Blue Origin's facilities to SpaceX's launch complex further fuels their concerns. They highlight their presence at Kennedy Space Center, including a sizable manufacturing site near SpaceX's Launch Complex 39A and other properties potentially affected by Starship operations.Commenting on Blue Origin's request, Musk said in a post on X, formerly Twitter: ""Sue Origin"".As a user on X pointed out, ""...The post appears to be a tongue-in-cheek comment about Blue Origin's past lawsuits against SpaceX, such as the one over NASA 's lunar lander contract. The phrase ""Sue Origin"" could be interpreted as a sarcastic way of saying that Blue Origin has a history of resorting to legal action rather than competing fairly in the marketplace.""","Bezos' Blue Origin has filed a complaint with the FAA to potentially limit Starship launches at Cape Canaveral, Florida.

Importance of this new app



Conversation Cloud platform Gupshup has announced India's first Conversational Buyer App on the government’s Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC), at its event Conversations 2024 in Delhi. It enables buyers to use a WhatsApp-based conversational UI to discover, browse, and buy products from sellers across the ONDC network , without needing to download any other mobile app. Soon, Gupshup will also offer this product capability to its enterprise customers who want to integrate conversational commerce into their chatbots. This launch demonstrates the perfect alignment of Gupshup's vision of a conversational internet with ONDC's mission of democratising digital commerce.Commenting on the announcement, Gupshup CEO, Beerud Sheth said:The Buyer App is in Beta and will initially have limited availability, allowing users to order food & beverages like biryani on WhatsApp.Customers will be able to share their location over chat, browse sellers close to them, order food, and make payments right from WhatsApp. Support for additional conversational channels such as Google RCS and Voice is also coming soon.With these capabilities, merchants, and businesses looking to participate in the ONDC eCommerce ecosystem can leverage the Gupshup ONDC Commerce Platform and speed up their time to market. Here’s how the app will work:More than 650 million Indians are now active on social media and messaging platforms. Despite this massive engagement, only 30% of users (nearly 200 million) shop online. Meanwhile, a whopping 50% of the remaining 450 million haven't even used any apps beyond social media and entertainment. Furthermore, 65% of savvy digital users find app downloads frustrating and 40% abandon a purchase if pushed to install apps.","Gupshup has announced India's first Conversational Buyer App on the government’s Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) It enables buyers to use a WhatsApp- based conversational UI to discover, browse, and buy products from sellers across the ONDC network.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111293916,imgsize-37674,width-400,resizemode-4/111293916.jpg"

Benarroch was fired in early June and Nick Pickles has now assumed his role, the report added.A report by The Financial Times, Benarroch – who was the head of business operations and communications at the company – was fired in part for allegedly failing to inform the public about the rollout of X's new adult content policy .The new policy on adult content – that has existed on the platform for a long time – makes it clear that such photographs and videos are allowed as long as it's consensual. Other rules include a ban on obscene behaviour on the platform.X also says that it will restrict exposure of such content to children as well as for those who don't want to see it. Additionally, adult content in highly visible areas like profile pictures and banners are not allowed.The development of Benarroch's departure was first reported earlier this month by The Wall Street Journal. He acted as a close advisor to Yaccarino as the pair previously worked together at NBCUniversal, where Yaccarino was the chief of advertising.The platform is struggling to attract more advertisers, hence, notifying about the changes in adult content policy may have become a big issue. Yaccarino is also said to be facing pressure to reduce costs and raise revenue for the company, the report said.Musk has reportedly brought Steve Davis, a chief executive at Musk's tunnel project, Boring Company, to review X's financial health.Pickles, meanwhile, will be temporarily leading global communications. His current role is the head of global government affairs at X. He is among those employees who weren’t laid off when Elon Musk took over the company in 2022.",Joe Benarroch was the head of business operations and communications at X.

Why laid-off Paytm employees have filed complaints with labour ministry,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-laid-off-paytm-employees-have-filed-complaints-with-labour-ministry/articleshow/111175333.cms,"What laid-off employees have to say



Paytm founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma’s job cuts warning



Several Paytm employees who have been laid off have reportedly filed complaints with the ministry of labour and employment alleging that the fintech company has made ""unlawful termination"" without proper compensation. The complaints, filed between June 1 and June 12, seek reinstatement.Moneycontrol said that it accessed a copy of the filed complaint on the ministry's Samandhan portal and the same has been also verified by an official.The complaints claim that the Paytm management conducted unfair and unethical termination practices. Employees have also included supporting documents, including emails and official records with the complaints. While the report hasn’t revealed the exact number of complaints, some claim that it could be around 50.While some ex-employees said that they are waiting for a response from the ministry, a few others said that they were forced to resign.“We are awaiting a response from the Ministry and hope the case will be taken up by them. If not satisfactory, will take the court route,” said one of the employees, who claimed to have been terminated by Paytm without compensation or justification.Some employees have alleged being forced to ""voluntarily resign"".“My HRBP reached out to me yesterday (June 20) saying if I don’t resign by 12pm today (June 21), I will be terminated. I will take up the legal route as soon as possible. A few others are planning to do the same while some are already in the process,” another one said.In a letter to its shareholders last month, Paytm founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma acknowledged the company's first-ever sales decline. As per Sharma, the company is implementing cost-cutting measures targeting employee expenses, aiming to save Rs 400-500 crore annually.""One97 Communications Limited (OCL) is providing outplacement support to employees which have resigned as a part of the restructuring efforts by the company,” the company previously said.“As we harness AI capabilities and enhance governance structures, we are fully committed towards building our business according to regulatory compliances,” the Paytm letter added.Sharma also noted that the company will move forward with a “leaner organisation structure.” Apart from suggesting job cuts, Paytm also said that it will trim its non-core assets.","Several Paytm employees who have been laid off have reportedly filed complaints with the ministry of labour and employment.

Melinda stepped from Gates foundation after the divorce

Bill Gates divorced Melinda French Gates in 2021. Years later, Melinda French Gates has opened up about her divorce with the Microsoft co-founder. In an interview with Time Magazine recently, she described the end of 27-years marriage as ‘a painful and horrible experience’.“Getting a divorce is a horrible thing. It’s just painful. It’s awful when you realize you need one,” she said. Although later she corrected 'horrible' to 'hard', but added that things are wonderful now that it’s over.During the interview, Melinda Gates also talked about how getting divorced in a pandemic helped the couple get privacy. “It gave us the privacy to do what needed to be done in private,"" she told the publication.She also reflected on being able to navigate the process while taking care of children. “You know, I separated first before I made the full decision about a divorce. And to be able to do that in private while I’m still trying to take care of the kids, while still making certain decisions about how you’re going to disentangle your life - thank God,"" she said.The divorce led her to step away from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in May this year, three years after the divorce. During the interview, she told Time that she thought about the effect of divorce on the foundation.""I thought a lot about my three children. But I certainly thought about the effect on the foundation. Those are the three biggest buckets: me, the kids, and the foundation. And I wanted to make sure that when we came through it to the other side - all of those pieces were intact.”Melinda also explained that she does not see her decision to exit the foundation as ‘downsizing’. “I don’t see it honestly as a downsizing ...I was just ready to be able to have full decision-making control about where all the funds go,” she said.","Melinda stepped from Gates foundation after the divorce in May this year.

Save money on your OTT subscriptions with these best tips,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-tips/save-money-on-your-ott-subscriptions-with-these-best-tips/articleshow/111267043.cms,"Tips to slash your OTT subscription costs

Evaluate your subscriptions

How often do you use each service?

Are there overlapping content offerings?

Which services offer the most value for your viewing preferences?

Take advantage of free trials

Bundle subscriptions

Share subscriptions with family and friends

Look for discounts and promotions

Opt for ad-supported plans

Downgrade to a lower tier

Cancel unused subscriptions

Take advantage of yearly plans

Keep an eye on price increases

Rotate OTT subscriptions based on content releases

Use cashback and reward programs

Use public libraries

Monitor your viewing habits

In the age of streaming, Over-the-Top (OTT) platforms have completely transformed the way we consume entertainment. These platforms offer a vast array of content, from movies and TV shows to documentaries and live sports, making it possible to access virtually any type of entertainment on demand. The convenience and variety offered by OTT services have led to their widespread adoption, and many households now subscribe to multiple streaming platforms to cater to diverse viewing preferences.However, with the increasing number of available options, managing multiple subscriptions can become overwhelming and costly. Each platform typically requires a separate subscription fee, and these costs can quickly add up, putting a strain on your budget. Moreover, the abundance of content across various services means that it's easy to subscribe to more than you actually need or use, leading to unnecessary expenses.Fortunately, there are several strategies you can employ to save money on OTT subscriptions without sacrificing your viewing experience. By being strategic about your subscription choices and making the most of available offers and features, you can enjoy your favourite shows and movies while keeping costs under control.The first step towards saving on OTT subscriptions is to evaluate your current subscriptions. List all the streaming services you subscribe to and consider the following:By assessing your usage and preferences, you can identify subscriptions to cancel or downgrade. If you rarely watch content on a particular platform, consider cancelling it and redirecting those funds to a service you use more frequently.Many OTT platforms offer free trials for new users, ranging from a week to a month. Use these free trials to explore different services and their content libraries without committing financially. Set reminders to cancel the trial before it ends to avoid charges. You can also take turns using free trials from different platforms to enjoy their content without paying for multiple subscriptions simultaneously.Many streaming services provide bundled packages that combine multiple subscriptions at a reduced price. For instance, Disney+ offers a bundle that includes Hulu and ESPN+ for less than the cost of subscribing to each service separately. Search for bundles that match your viewing habits and preferences to save money.Many OTT platforms permit multiple profiles or simultaneous streaming on various devices. Utilise this feature by sharing subscriptions with family members or friends. Split the cost of a subscription among multiple users to reduce individual expenses. Check each platform's terms of service to ensure you are not violating any rules.Watch for discounts and promotions from OTT platforms, as many services provide special deals during holidays, anniversaries, or other significant events. Additionally, some platforms provide discounts for students, military personnel, and senior citizens. Sign up for newsletters or follow the platforms on social media to stay informed about upcoming promotions.Many streaming services provide ad-supported plans at a reduced cost compared to their ad-free versions. Although watching ads might be a slight inconvenience, it can lead to substantial savings. Evaluate whether ad-supported plans are a viable option for you, especially if the cost difference is substantial.If you don't need all the features offered by your current subscription tier, consider downgrading to a lower tier. If you're currently subscribed to a premium plan that includes 4K streaming but primarily watch content on a standard HD screen, transitioning to a standard plan could be a cost-saving option. Evaluate your viewing habits and requirements to decide if downgrading to a lower-tier plan would meet your needs effectively.Over time, it's common to collect multiple subscriptions, some of which may remain unused. Regularly assess your subscriptions and cancel those that are no longer in use. This straightforward action can redirect funds to more worthwhile purposes. Be vigilant about monitoring cancellation deadlines to prevent unnecessary charges for services you no longer require.Choosing a yearly plan instead of monthly subscriptions can lead to significant savings. Numerous OTT platforms offer discounts on annual subscriptions, equating to several months of service for free compared to monthly rates. Opting for a yearly plan is a prudent decision if you anticipate long-term use of a service, ensuring cost-effectiveness in the long run.Streaming services occasionally increase their subscription prices. Stay informed about upcoming price hikes and evaluate whether the service still offers good value at the new rate. If a price increase makes a subscription less affordable, consider switching to a different service or taking advantage of available promotions.The content offerings on OTT platforms are dynamic, regularly updating with new movies and shows while removing others. To optimise your savings, consider rotating your subscriptions according to the release schedules of your preferred content. Subscribe to a service for a period, enjoy the content you want, then cancel and switch to another platform. This method ensures you only pay for subscriptions when actively watching content that aligns with your current interests.Certain credit cards and cashback apps provide rewards for streaming service transactions, allowing you to earn cashback or points that can be used towards future subscriptions. Additionally, several OTT platforms have referral programs that offer incentives such as free months of service for referring new subscribers. These programs can help you maximise savings and get more value out of your streaming subscriptions.Several public libraries collaborate with streaming platforms like Kanopy and Hoopla to provide complimentary access to their services. Contact your local library to inquire about available OTT services, enabling you to enjoy a wide selection of movies and shows at no extra expense.Finally, paying attention to your viewing habits can assist you in making well-informed choices regarding your subscriptions. Monitor the time you spend on each platform and the types of content you enjoy the most. This data can help you select subscriptions that are not only cost-effective but also cater to your entertainment preferences effectively.","In the age of streaming, Over-the-Top (OTT) platforms have completely transformed the way we consume entertainment.

Apple Intelligence launch in China may face these three ‘challenges’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-intelligence-launch-in-china-may-face-these-three-challenges/articleshow/111147927.cms,"Tough rules for AI models

Ban on ChatGPT, which will be integrated in Apple devices

Privacy, a core focus for Apple

China has tough rules for AI models

Ban on OpenAI’s ChatGPT in China

Private Cloud Compute

Apple has announced Apple Intelligence , a suite of AI features that will run on iPhones, iPads and Mac PCs. The AI features will be available later this year to users globally, including China – one the most critical markets for the company. However, the company’s big AI push may face some challenges in China as regulators have in place strict rules around the technology amid tough competition.The three challenges that the company may face in China are (via CNBC):China’s AI market is tightly regulated and all companies launching AI models must have approval from the regulators for the commercial use of LLMs. The country has also made it mandatory for Generative AI providers to take down “illegal” content.Since some of the features of Apple Intelligence are developed by the company itself, Apple will likely need to get its AI model approved by authorities under Chinese rules.China has also banned OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Some of Apple’s voice assistant Siri’s capabilities are dependent on ChatGPT. This could mean that Apple may have to find a local AI company that provides the same level of capabilities as ChatGPT. Baidu and Alibaba are among China’s technology giants that have their own LLMs and voice assistants.Apple's AI launch highlighted a focus on user privacy. Their new system, Private Cloud Compute, processes user data on Apple-owned servers, with the company claiming the data itself is not stored.However, in China, Apple's iCloud data is stored on servers located locally and operated by a third party. This may raise concerns about whether Apple can maintain complete control over its AI computing servers in the country.This means that Apple must have a similar partnership for its AI servers in the region to keep user data private.","Apple has announced Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI features that will run on iPhones, iPads and Mac PCs.

TCS sees headcount fall first time in 19 years

India's largest IT services company Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is facing a significant challenge filling a massive number of open positions. During a town hall earlier this month, the global operations head of TCS ' resource management group (RMG) Amar Shetye revealed that the company currently has thousands of open positions that it is not able to fill due to the skills gap.Shetye put the number at 80,000. For those unaware, the RMG team at TCS is responsible for allocation of available resources to various projects across the company and in case of any shortfall, fill such requirements through contractors. These contractors are on the roles of the hiring agencies and may or may not be hired as permanent staff by the company.Skills gap, here means, a mismatch between the skills possessed by employees and those their roles demand.An employee who attended the townhall anonymously told TOI, ""We were told that either skillsets or employee aspirations are not matching project requirements. However, at TCS, no associate is forced to take on a project if they are not comfortable with it.""""He told us that we should consider ourselves fortunate that the firm is not laying off employees for not being mapped to any project unlike other firms,"" another employee on the bench added.The company’s recent annual report revealed that 33% of job requirements are currently being met by grooming existing talent.Post the announcement of fourth quarter results, TCS CEO K Krithivasan said that the company has built one of the largest artificial-intelligence-ready workforces in the world. ""TCS is currently working over 200 engagements in GenAI with our clients and foresees a promising pipeline of future work across all industries,"" he wrote.TCS posted strong performance in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 2024-25. ""This is a quarter of strong deals and execution for us. Continuous focus on operational excellence helped us achieve a 26% operating margin."" The management also said that deal wins were ""across markets, industries and geographies.""The Mumbai-headquartered company said that it had signed new deals totalling $13.2 billion in the fourth quarter, which is one of the highest ever for the company even as it signalled a cautious turnaround for the industry. The company added that the pain may be bottoming out and FY25 will be better than FY24.TCS's Gen-AI deal pipeline is said to have touched $900 million. “Our Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) pipeline has surged to $900 million, marking a doubling in value. The Total Contract Value (TCV) of the deal comprises primarily standard-sized deals, with the exception of a significant win secured in Q3,"" the company said in its earnings report.TCS' full year headcount fell for the first time in 19 years.

Starting June 25, HDFC Bank will stop sending text alerts for low-value UPI transactions. This means that HDFC Bank customers will receive SMS alerts for UPI transactions exceeding Rs 100 when sending money and similar notification for when received is above Rs 500. However, the bank will continue to send email alerts for all transactions with no absolutely change.In a mail as well as SMS alert sent to its customers, HDFC Bank said: “Starting from 25th June, 2024: Email Alerts: Continue to receive email alerts for all UPI transactions. SMS Notifications: Now only for transactions above Rs 100 (money sent/paid) and Rs 500 (money received).”This change aligns with banking norms, which require text messages for transactions over Rs 5,000. Despite this, many banks send alerts for lower-value debits as well. HDFC Bank stated that feedback indicated alerts for low-value transactions were deemed 'not useful,' as there is often duplication of notifications from UPI payment apps.Bankers noted that bulk text messages cost between Rs 0.01-0.03 each. With UPI transactions averaging around 40 crores per day, banks collectively spend several crores daily on text message alerts.Banks are also promoting the use of UPI Lite for transactions up to Rs 500. UPI Lite allows a small amount of money to be set aside by the app, facilitating quick payments without the need for second-factor authentication.By reducing the frequency of low-value transaction alerts, HDFC Bank and others aim to streamline notifications for customers while also cutting costs.

This button may use a soft tap for focus and a double tap/hard press for capture, offering an improved camera experience.This alignment will reportedly enable spatial video recording capabilities similar to iPhone 15 Pro which has two cameras stacked vertically while the third camera is arranged diagonally.However, the latest rumours contradict earlier reports that suggested that the iPhone 16 may arrive with a buttonless design.The leaked case also suggests that Apple may be adding more buttons alongside the volume and power controls. The customisable ""Action"" button, which was introduced in iPhone 15 Pro, may also make a return in iPhone 16. This button also has the potential to replace the mute switch and offer users programmable functionalities. If these rumours are to be true, it would significantly alter the look and feel of the iPhone 16 lineup.","A new leak suggests that the iPhone 16 may get a major design overhaul.
