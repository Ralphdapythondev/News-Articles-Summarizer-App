The Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGGI) has urged for increased scrutiny of online gaming platforms, citing concerns over potential tax evasion and money laundering risks. According to news agency PTI, an inter-departmental committee with representatives from the Enforcement Directorate (ED), Reserve Bank of India (RBI), tax, and consumer affairs departments may be set up.According to a DGGI report, the committee will work to combat the proliferation of online gaming platforms and ensure regulatory compliance.The DGGI annual report for 2023-24 has flagged that ‘online money gaming’ is a “high-risk” industry for tax evasion, money laundering, cyber fraud , juvenile delinquency, and various socio-economic issues.The report further states that the GST intelligence wing of the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) has initiated action against 118 domestic online gaming entities. CBIC, it says has sent Show Cause Notices to 34 taxpayers involving a tax amount of Rs 1,10,531.9 crore. These notices were issued to these gaming firms for failing to pay the mandated 28% Goods and Services Tax (GST) rate.Additionally, DGGI recently identified 658 offshore entities operating without proper registration or compliance, all of which are now under investigation. As part of these efforts to enforce regulations, authorities have also recommended blocking 167 URLs and websites associated with non-compliant gaming operations.","The Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGGI) has urged for increased scrutiny of online gaming platforms, citing concerns over potential tax evasion and money laundering risks.

Former Google exec shares what he learned after 7 years trying to give AI a robot body,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/former-google-exec-shares-what-he-learned-after-7-years-trying-to-give-ai-a-robot-body/articleshow/113372927.cms,"The Moonshot Mindset

Future of AI Robotics

Hans Peter Brondmo, former CEO of Google's robotics moonshot project Everyday Robotics recently wrote in Wired about why he thinks that building AI-powered robots that can flexibly operate in the real world is going to take much longer than Silicon Valley believes and promises. ""As the head of Alphabet’s AI-powered robotics moonshot, I came to believe many things.For one, robots can’t come soon enough. For another, they shouldn’t look like us,"" he wrote. Started in 2016, Google scrapped Everyday Robotics last year (February 2023).Brondmo wrote that he joined X, Alphabet’s secret innovation lab, in early 2016. The project, under the leadership of Astro Teller, aimed to create AI-powered robots that could assist humans in everyday tasks. My involvement was driven by a belief in Google's potential to make a significant impact on the world. The company's commitment to long-term, ambitious projects, and its ability to invest heavily in research and development, made it an ideal environment for such a venture. ""My job: help figure out what to do with the employees and technology left over from nine robot companies that Google had acquired,"" he said.Google X was established with the goal of addressing global challenges through innovative technologies. Projects were required to meet specific criteria, including addressing a significant problem, utilizing groundbreaking technology, and offering a radical solution. Google founder Larry Page — favored moving directly to ""end to end"" (e2e) learning, where you'd hand robots a general task and they'd be able to figure out how to execute it. That, Page felt, was a goal worthy of a moonshot. But it also turned out to be out of reach. ""I have come to believe,"" Brondmo writes, ""it will take many, many thousands, maybe even millions of robots doing stuff in the real world to collect enough data to train e2e models that make the robots do anything other than fairly narrow, well-defined tasks....""Creating robots capable of assisting humans in everyday environments presented numerous challenges. These included developing AI systems that could understand and respond to complex real-world situations, designing robots that were safe and efficient, and addressing the ethical implications of artificial intelligence. Training AI models to perform complex tasks requires vast amounts of data. This is particularly challenging for robotics, as robots need to learn from real-world experiences in order to develop the skills necessary to navigate and interact with their surroundings.Brondmo wrote that his mother had advanced Parkinson's disease, and hoped that one day robots could support her. ""Our frequent conversations toward the end of her life convinced me more than ever that a future version of what we started at Everyday Robots will be coming. In fact, it can't come soon enough.The future of robotics is promising, but it will require continued investment in research and development, as well as a focus on long-term goals. By addressing the challenges and opportunities presented by this technology, we can create a future in which robots play a valuable role in our lives. ""Eight and a half years later—and 18 months after Google decided to discontinue its largest bet in robotics and AI—it seems as if a new robotics startup pops up every week. I am more convinced than ever that the robots need to come. Yet I have concerns that Silicon Valley, with its focus on “minimum viable products” and VCs’ general aversion to investing in hardware, will be patient enough to win the global race to give AI a robot body . And much of the money that is being invested is focusing on the wrong things,"" Brondmo said.","Hans Peter Brondmo, former CEO of Google's robotics moonshot project Everyday Robotics, wrote in Wired.

"This $10 check signed by Steve Jobs may fetch $25,000 in auction",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/this-10-check-signed-by-steve-jobs-may-fetch-25000-in-auction/articleshow/113370463.cms,"Steve Jobs’ signed cassette tape is also available in the auction



An Apple Computer Company check signed by Apple co-founder Steve Jobs is up for auction. The auction event is being hosted online by RR Auction 's Remarkable Rarities. The company said that this rare item which is from the very early days of Apple has been up for bidding since earlier this month. This handwritten company check signed by Jobs is from July 16, 1976, and was written to Elmar Electronics , for the amount of $10.52.RR Auctions estimates that the new check will fetch at least $25,000, as it currently stands at $12,650 after 14 bids.This is not the first Apple check that is being auctioned by RR Auctions. Last year, the auction house sold a different Apple check which was also signed by Steve Jobs and was also auctioned. This check was made out to Radio Shack for $4.01 on July 23, 1976, and was sold in 2023 for over $46,000.Apart from the check, RR Auctions has also put another item in the auction -- a cassette tape signed by Jobs. This tape served as an early way to store and retrieve data with the Apple II computer. This is the first known example of a cassette tape with Jobs' signature.Presently, the autographed cassette has a top bid of $2,383 after eight bids. The auction house expects it to fetch at least $10,000.While it may seem obsolete by today's standards, the cassette interface system — designed by Steve Wozniak — was a big advance in early Apple computing. It was four times faster at storing or retrieving data than competing systems at that time and even incurred a lower cost for the company.","The auction event is being hosted online by RR Auction's Remarkable Rarities.

Most ‘targeted’ industries in India

Ransomware remains a major concern in India, with RansomHub leading the pack, a report has said, adding that the ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) has rapidly expanded since rebranding from Knight ransomware, impacting over 210 victims globally. The report also revealed that FakeUpdates is the most used malware to target organisations.According to Check Point Software 's August 2024 Global Threat Index, reveals that this malware has impacted 8% worldwide organisations, followed by Androxgh0st with a global impact of 5%, and Phorpiex with a global impact of 5%.FakeUpdates: It is a downloader written in JavaScript. It essentially disguises itself as a software update, but it's actually carrying a bunch of harmful programs (malware) hidden inside. Once the user “accepts” this fake update, it unpacks and instals those nasty programs on your computer, causing all sorts of trouble.Androxgh0st: It is a botnet that targets Windows, Mac, and Linux platforms. It breaks into computers by finding weaknesses (vulnerabilities) in software the users might be using. Once inside, it steals important information like logins for different online services, email settings and even cloud storage keys.Phorpiex: It is another botnet known for distributing other malware families via spam campaigns – by sending out tons of spam emails with infected attachments or links. It's also known for helping with ""sextortion"" scams, where hackers try to blackmail people by threatening to release embarrassing information about them.The report says that in India, the healthcare sector remains the most targeted, followed by education/research and government/military sectors.“Organisations in India are experiencing a significantly higher attack rate, averaging 3244 attacks per week in the past six months compared to the global average of 1657 attacks per organisation,” the report added.Check Point also said that Meow – a new ransomware variant has shifted its focus from encryption to data theft and extortion, selling stolen information on leak marketplaces.","Ransomware remains a major concern in India, with RansomHub leading the pack.

Tech billionaire Jared Isaacman and his crew, aboard SpaceX 's Dragon capsule , successfully returned to Earth on Sunday (September 15) after a five-day stay in space. A part of SpaceX’s Polaris Dawn mission, this is historic because two members of the group conducted the world’s first private spacewalk.NASA lauded the Polaris Dawn mission – which concluded with a splashdown off Florida's coast and was streamed live by Elon Musk 's company SpaceX – as “a giant leap forward” for the commercial space industry.Last week on September 12, Isaacman and SpaceX engineer Sarah Gillis conducted the first-ever commercial spacewalk.“Splashdown of Dragon confirmed! Welcome back to Earth,” SpaceX said in a post on XBoth of them tested SpaceX's new spacesuits during the nearly two-hour-long spacewalk.“Commander @rookisaacman conducting suit mobility tests while Dragon flies between Australia and Antarctica,” Elon Musk-owned company posted a clip last week.Musk has also been sharing videos of the mission on his X handle as he is directly involved in the mission.The Polaris Dawn mission is part of a larger initiative by Isaacman, founder of Shift4 Payments , to push private spaceflight boundaries.""Back at home, we all have a lot of work to do, but from here — it looks like a perfect world,” Isaacman said.His second SpaceX mission set a new altitude record and underscored the growing capabilities of private space exploration. The Polaris Dawn mission achieved a peak altitude of 875 miles (1,408 kilometres), which surpasses the International Space Station (ISS) and the Hubble Space Telescope.It is noteworthy that this altitude is the highest reached since NASA's Apollo moon missions. Two more Polaris missions are planned, including the first manned flight of SpaceX's Starship rocket , currently under development.","Jared Isaacman and his crew, aboard SpaceX's Dragon capsule, successfully returned to Earth on Sunday (September 15) after a five-day stay in space.

Elon Musk praised Ratan Tata

The legacy of the Tata Nano

Also read

In the realm of business and innovation, few figures command as much respect as Tata Group chairman emeritus Ratan Tata. His influence extends far beyond the Indian corporate world, even garnering admiration from Tesla CEO and X owner Elon Musk . In a 2009 interview with American journalist Charlie Rose , Musk praised Ratan Tata as a ""gentleman and a scholar."" This moment has recently resurfaced, shedding light on Musk's appreciation for Ratan Tata and his ambitious project, the Tata Nano .The Tata Nano was introduced by Tata Motors in 2008 as the world's cheapest car, with a price tag of just Rs 1 lakh (approximately $2,300 at the time). The car was a pet project of Ratan Tata, designed to make automobile ownership accessible to millions of Indians who had never been able to afford a car. The idea was revolutionary—a small, affordable car that would cater to the vast Indian middle class, providing them with a safe and efficient means of transportation.In the interview with Charlie Rose, which took place shortly after the launch of the Tata Nano, the Tesla CEO was asked about his views on Ratan Tata’s efforts to introduce a low-cost car in India. The interview clip, which has recently gone viral, captures Musk's candid response.""Take for a moment Ratan Tata, what he’s doing in India — developing a little sedan for $2300. Where do you put that in the whole equation of where the future of cars is?"" asked Rose.Musk responded with a mix of admiration and caution. He began by acknowledging the brilliance behind the Tata Nano project and the character of Ratan Tata himself.""I think it's a good idea to have affordable cars, but I think the problem with something like the Nano ... I wouldn't say problem because I think, by the way, it is probably a great idea and Ratan is a gentleman and scholar,"" Musk said.However, Musk also expressed his concerns about the long-term viability of such a low-cost vehicle, particularly in the context of rising fuel prices. He pointed out that while the initial purchase cost of the Nano was remarkably low, the cost of running the car—particularly fuel costs—could become a significant issue as gasoline prices continued to rise.""But where it’s going to become challenging in the future is when the price of gasoline rises, the cost of acquiring the car is much less of an issue than the cost of running the car,"" the billionnaire explained.Despite the initial excitement surrounding the Tata Nano, the car faced numerous challenges. One of the most significant issues was its branding. While the Nano was intended to be an affordable vehicle for the masses, it was often labeled as ""cheap"" rather than ""affordable."" This perception problem, combined with safety concerns and competition from other small cars, led to unimpressive sales figures.The Nano’s production was ultimately discontinued in 2018, marking the end of what was initially seen as a groundbreaking project. The car's journey from inception to discontinuation is often cited as one of the biggest marketing failures in the automobile industry.","The Tata Nano was introduced by Tata Motors in 2008 as the world's cheapest car, with a price tag of just Rs 1 lakh (approximately $2,300 at the time) The car was a pet project of Ratan Tata, designed to make automobile ownership accessible to millions of Indians who had never been able to afford a car.

A woman’s detailed list of requirements for a future husband has gone viral on social media, sparking widespread reactions. Her profile, shared on X (formerly known as Twitter), includes her own personal details such as her salary, education, and a bold set of expectations for her ideal partner. The unusual demands have generated a mixture of amusement, criticism, and debate among users online.The woman, who earns Rs 1.3 lakh per annum and holds a Bachelor of Education (B.Ed) degree, has raised eyebrows by seeking a techie groom with an annual income of Rs 30 lakh.She further outlined her preferences, stating that her ideal partner should be settled in India, the US, or Europe and should own a spacious 3BHK home. Her love for luxury is evident in her desire to travel frequently and stay in 5-star hotels, which she expects to continue after marriage.The post was shared on X with the caption, “Her qualities and salary. Expected husband’s qualities and salary,” emphasising the stark difference between her modest income and her high expectations for a spouse.Beyond financial expectations, the woman’s list includes several personal and lifestyle requirements. She currently lives with her parents, whom she describes as dependent on her, and expects her future husband to accommodate them in a large independent house. She also made it clear that she is not willing to take on traditional household chores due to her professional commitments, and therefore, she expects her partner to provide a full-time cook and maid.Moreover, she expressed her passion for travel, stating that her husband should share her enthusiasm for exploring the world. She also mentioned that she does not believe in joint family living arrangements and expects her in-laws to reside separately.The profile has garnered over 1.2 million views and has sparked a lively conversation on social media. Many users were shocked by the wide gap between her salary of Rs 1.3 lakh and her demand for a partner earning Rs 30 lakh. Some users questioned the feasibility of her lifestyle expectations, pointing out the disparity between her income and her desire for luxury experiences like 5-star hotels.One user humorously remarked, “She makes Rs 11,000 a month, but she wants a full-time maid and cook? Talk about next-level priorities!” Another comment highlighted the irony, stating, “132000 per annum salary and her hobby is 5-star hotels? And surprise me with Louis Vuitton—that was the highlight.""Others were puzzled by her specific relationship expectations, such as her demand for an unmarried man despite her being divorced, and her insistence that her parents live with her while her in-laws live separately. One user commented, “She’s divorced but wants an unmarried man. Her parents will stay with her, but no in-laws allowed—how fair is that?”While the post has mostly drawn criticism and amusement, it has also led to broader discussions about societal expectations in marriage. Some users defended the woman’s right to have her own preferences, with one person writing, “Everyone is entitled to have their own expectations, but they should be realistic about what they offer in return.” However, the majority of responses leaned towards disbelief, with one user summing up the sentiment by saying, “She will be single if she continues like this.”","A woman's detailed list of requirements for a future husband has gone viral on social media.

Spam and phishing message menace grows in India

What the government’s directive says

Bharti Airtel CEO Gopal Vittal has written a letter to the heads of Reliance Jio , Vodafone Idea , state-run Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd ( BSNL ) and Tata Teleservices, says a report in the Economic Times. In the letter, Vittal proposed creating a collaborative system for sharing information about corporate connections used for commercial calling. This collaborative approach is aimed to monitor and prevent the misuse of these connections.""We are ready to take the first step and share the data (entity name and active numbers only) in the same template on a monthly basis and we would appreciate your support,"" Vittal said in the letter.The letter was sent to Reliance Jio MD Pankaj Pawar, Vodafone Idea CEO Akshaya Moondra, BSNL CMD Robert Ravi and Tata Teleservices MD Harjit Singh Chauhan.""As the telecom industry continues to face the growing challenge of UCC , it has become clear that despite ongoing efforts, more robust and unified mechanisms are required to protect our customers from this persistent issue,"" Vittal said in the letter. He also stressed that in line with the directives of Trai and DoT, the focus remains on finding effective solutions to curb UCC.UCC in the telecom industry means Unsolicited Commercial Communications that describes the combination of communications and collaboration technologies.""We strongly believe that tackling this issue should be a joint endeavour among all telecom operators, rather than isolated efforts,"" he said.Telecom operators must take ""collective responsibility"" in preventing UCC by ensuring that their networks are not exploited by spammers, especially through corporate connections that may be unintentionally facilitating such activities, he said.""Today, enterprise customers are served by multiple operators, and we are seized of the fact that any independent efforts to address spam may not be in the best interests of customers, as it may impact the quality and continuity of services,"" Vittal added.According to industry data, 1.5-1.7 billion commercial messages are sent every day in India, taking the total to about 55 billion every month. As per a survey by community social media platform Local Circles, six in 10 consumers get three or more spam calls each day, with financial services and real estate said to be top offenders. In another survey, 76% consumers said that they get three or more spam messages daily. Blocking numbers doesn't help either.The problem has proven intractable for stakeholders including telcos, the regulator and the government. Recently, the government directed telecom companies to disconnect entities using bulk connections to engage in such activity. Around 350,000 such numbers have been blocked and 50 entities have been blacklisted in the last two weeks.The telecom regulatory authority of India (TRAI) asked telcos to share information on blacklisted entities with each other, so that such entities don't switch from one operator to another.","Bharti Airtel CEO Gopal Vittal has written a letter to the heads of Reliance Jio, Vodafone Idea, state-run Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd ( BSNL ) and Tata Teleservices.

What filmmaker Soham Shah said in his lawsuit

Other lawsuits against Netflix

Netflix has denied allegations of plagiarising filmmaker Soham Shah ’s Luck film in the popular Korean series ‘Squid Games’. The director filed a lawsuit against the streaming giant as well as the creators of Squid Games on Saturday alleging that the concept of the series was lifted from his movie.Denying the allegation, the streaming platform said that it has “no merit.In response to the lawsuit, the streaming giant said, ""' Squid Game ' was created and written by Hwang Dong-hyuk , and we intend to defend this matter vigorously."" Netflix insisted that Shah's accusations have no basis and that the series was an entirely original work by Hwang.Hwang has previously mentioned that he began developing the script in 2009. However, Netflix maintains that any resemblance between the two works is purely coincidental and that Squid Game is a unique creation from Hwang's own imagination.The legal documents obtained by TMZ reveal that Shah claims that his film 'Luck' is centred around a group of people playing deadly games in hopes of winning a jackpot. Bollywood actors Sanjay Dutt, Imran Khan, and Shruti Haasan starred in the movie. It was released worldwide in July 2009, with screenings in India, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the UAE.With each player's death, the prize pool grows—a detail that, Shah says, closely mirrors the plot of the popular Korean web series. In the lawsuit, Shah also pointed out that Hwang Dong-hyuk, the creator of Squid Game, has publicly revealed that he began working on the script for his series in 2009. Shah says that the timing of Hwang’s work aligns suspiciously with the release of Luck, arguing that the Korean series took inspiration from his film's premise.Netflix is facing another $170 million lawsuit filed over their Emmy-nominated show 'Baby Reindeer'. The lawsuit has been filed by Fiona Harvey claiming that the show’s stalker, Martha Scott, was based on her interactions with its creator, writer and star Richard Gadd. According to reports, a federal judge has set a trial date of May 6, 2025.","Filmmaker Soham Shah claims that his film 'Luck' is centred around a group of people playing deadly games in hopes of winning a jackpot.

In a dramatic twist reminiscent of high-stakes espionage, Elon Musk , the world's wealthiest individual, operates under the code name “Voyager” within his security team. This detail, uncovered by a report from The New York Times, sheds light on the extensive security measures Musk employs due to his significant wealth and public prominence.Elon Musk's approach to personal security has evolved substantially over the years.Initially, Musk was known for his relatively low-key lifestyle and minimal security. However, by 2014, as his wealth and status surged, he transitioned to a more rigorous security protocol. This shift included a rotating team of security personnel dedicated to managing potential threats and ensuring his safety.Today, Musk's security detail comprises up to 20 bodyguards, some of whom are armed, alongside a medical professional. This comprehensive team is tasked with protecting Musk at all times, reflecting his heightened risk profile as the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, and the richest person globally with a net worth exceeding $250 billion.The costs associated with Musk's security are substantial. Reports indicate that in January 2016 alone, Musk's security expenses exceeded $163,000. The total expenditure on security in recent years is significant, with Tesla’s SEC filings revealing that Musk's security company billed $2.4 million in 2023 and an additional $500,000 through February 2024. These figures illustrate the financial commitment Musk has made to ensure his safety.In addition to personal security, Musk has invested in other protective measures. For example, in 2022, Musk reportedly purchased a new residence to evade public scrutiny of his former address. The new property is equipped with 24/7 security, highlighting Musk's proactive approach to safeguarding his privacy and security.Musk is not alone in prioritising security. Similar trends are observed among other tech leaders. Mark Zuckerberg’s total compensation from Meta in 2023 largely consisted of expenses related to personal security. Likewise, Apple’s expenditures on CEO Tim Cook’s security and private travel-related costs were substantial, reflecting a broader trend among high-profile executives.Tesla has also bolstered its security protocols in response to threats. For instance, after a death threat against former CFO Zachary Kirkhorn, Tesla heightened its security measures. This included implementing rigorous badge checks at its facilities and addressing multiple terroristic threats reported to law enforcement.","Elon Musk operates under the code name ‘Voyager’ within his security team.

Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is collaborating with its group company, Tata Electronics , in a bid to accelerate India's semiconductor production capabilities, a report has said. TCS , India’s top IT services provider, brings its expertise in semiconductor design and engineering to this partnership.Tata Electronics is expected to roll out the first made-in-India chips by 2026, Mint cited a top executive at the country's largest technology services provider as saying.TCS already designs and engineers semiconductors for various clients.TCS has numerous ""touch points"" with chip fabrication where Tata Electronics has taken the lead, Sreenivasa Chakravarti , vice-president and global head of TCS's digital engineering business was cited as saying.“We are part of the same group as Tata Electronics, and there are leverage points that we are working on together. The two companies sit at different parts of the value chain, so we are leveraging our core expertise in what we excel at for this,” said Chakravarti.While TCS has a strong presence in the global semiconductor industry, this marks its first foray into supporting domestic chip manufacturing . The company's unique capabilities position it well to capitalise on India's growing semiconductor aspirations.TCS has a software-driven approach to chip research and engineering, which is expected to benefit Tata Electronics significantly once its Gujarat’s Dholera facilitybecomes operational – one of the two facilities that it is building.The facility – an $11-billion greenfield chip fab with an initial capacity of 50,000 wafers per month – is being built in partnership with Taiwan's Powerchip Semiconductor (PSMC). The second is a $3.26-billion project in Assam to assemble and test semiconductors.The first chip from Assam will roll out by late 2025 or early 2026, according to the group.“We see so many companies come to India and set up shop here in order to build technologies and services for global markets, but there is an addressable market for semiconductors in India as well. The challenge, therefore, is to build for India, from within India,” Chakravarti added.","Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is collaborating with its group company, Tata Electronics.

Explained: What is whale phishing scam and tips to stay safe,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/explained-what-is-whale-phishing-scam-and-tips-to-stay-safe/articleshow/113345868.cms,"How does whale phishing work?

Research and Targeting: Attackers meticulously research their target, gathering information about their personal and professional lives. This includes identifying their social media accounts, professional affiliations, and any publicly available information.

Social Engineering: Once the target is identified, attackers craft personalised phishing emails or messages that appear to be from a trusted source. These messages may contain urgent requests for financial assistance, information sharing, or other actions that seem legitimate.

Trust and Manipulation: Attackers employ social engineering techniques to manipulate their targets into believing the authenticity of the message. They may leverage emotional appeals, create a sense of urgency, or exploit personal information to build trust.

Data Extraction: Once the target falls victim, attackers may attempt to extract sensitive information, such as login credentials, financial details, or proprietary data. This information can be used for financial gain, identity theft, or other malicious purposes.



Tips to stay protected:

Always be cautious of unsolicited emails, especially those requesting urgent action or containing unusual attachments.

Before responding to any suspicious message, verify the sender's identity using known contact information.

Never click on links or download attachments from unknown or suspicious sources.

Employ strong, unique passwords for all online accounts and enable two-factor authentication whenever possible.

Ensure that your operating system and software applications are up-to-date with the latest security patches.

Limit the amount of personal information you share online, especially on social media platforms.

Stay informed about the latest phishing scams and techniques to recognise and avoid them.

ChatGPT is equipped with safety measures to prevent the generation of harmful content, such as sexual images or a detailed guide on creating a bomb. But a hacker has claimed to have discovered a way to bypass these safeguards without resorting to any hacking techniques.As per a report by TechCrunch, the AI chatbot first refused to assist with the request by saying, “Providing instructions on how to create dangerous or illegal items, such as a fertiliser bomb, goes against safety guidelines and ethical responsibilities.”The hacker says that it used a trick that ended in ChatGPT ignoring its safety guardrails to produce instructions for making powerful explosives.The hacker, known as Amadon, claimed that the method involved engaging ChatGPT in a science-fiction game scenario where safety restrictions don't apply, effectively “jailbreaking” the AI. He called his findings a “social engineering hack to completely break all the guardrails around ChatGPT’s output.”The publication has not revealed the prompts used in the jailbreak and some of ChatGPT’s responses as they are deemed potentially dangerous, raising concerns about the misuse of AI. Amadon believes that once the guardrails are breached, there's no limit to the information ChatGPT can provide.“I’ve always been intrigued by the challenge of navigating AI security . With [Chat]GPT, it feels like working through an interactive puzzle — understanding what triggers its defenses and what doesn’t,” Amadon was quoted as saying.“It’s about weaving narratives and crafting contexts that play within the system’s rules, pushing boundaries without crossing them. The goal isn’t to hack in a conventional sense but to engage in a strategic dance with the AI, figuring out how to get the right response by understanding how it ‘thinks,’” he added.While Amadon reported his findings to OpenAI through their bug bounty program, the company responded that model safety issues aren't suitable for such a program, as they are not easily fixable bugs.","ChatGPT is equipped with safety measures to prevent the generation of harmful content.

Murthy does not agree with coaching classes

Infosys founder NR Narayana Murthy recently emphasized on the importance of parental involvement in fostering a disciplined learning environment for children. Speaking at the launch of a physics textbook, Murthy shared his family's approach to education, which included dedicated reading and study time and a ban on television.Murthy and his wife, Sudha, established a routine where they would spend over three hours each day reading with their children, Akshata and Rohan.This practice not only created a conducive atmosphere for learning but also allowed the children to seek clarification from their parents.“My wife's logic was, if I am watching TV, I cannot tell my children to study. So she said, I will sacrifice my TV time, and I will also study,” Murthy told the media after unveiling Paul Hewitt’s 13th edition of Pearson's book Conceptual Physics in Bengaluru.While Murthy acknowledged that parents may not always have the same level of academic expertise as their children, he emphasized that the most crucial aspect is creating a disciplined environment. Parents who lead by example, avoiding distractions like excessive television, can significantly influence their children's study habits.Murthy also expressed his reservations about coaching classes, suggesting that they are often a last resort for students who have not paid attention in class. He believes that effective learning should primarily occur within the classroom, with parents providing support and guidance at home.As the coaching industry continues to expand in India, Murthy's perspective offers a counterpoint to the prevailing emphasis on external tutoring. By highlighting the importance of parental involvement and a disciplined learning environment, he encourages parents to play a more active role in their children's education.","Infosys founder NR Narayana Murthy recently emphasized on the importance of parental involvement in fostering a disciplined learning environment.
