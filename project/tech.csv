Read sends a warning message to employees

Mark Read , the CEO of WPP – the world's largest advertising company as of 2023 – has reportedly been targeted by scammers . A report says that fraudsters used a deepfake technique to set up a call but were unable to successfully execute the cyber attack .According to a report by The Financial Times, the scammers used Read’s voice clone and public YouTube footage to set up a Microsoft Teams call with senior executives.Citing an email sent by Read to colleagues, the publication reported that the scammers used a publicly available photo to set up a fake WhatsApp account under his name.A Microsoft Teams call was also arranged between one of his agency heads, another senior executive and the scammers. At the Teams meeting, a voice clone and YouTube footage of the other executive was used while scammers impersonated Read off-camera using the chat function.“The pretext was that the individual targeted was being asked to set up a new business with the ultimate aim of extracting personal details and money. Fortunately the attackers were not successful,” Read has been quoted as saying.Read has also warned his colleagues that WPP had “seen increasing sophistication in the cyber attacks on our colleagues, and those targeted at senior leaders in particular”.The CEO added that the attack, which was first reported in the Guardian, showed “how these techniques are specifically designed to target individuals at a level that is far more tailored and psychological than the scams defrauding the vulnerable or general public”.A WPP spokesperson said: “Thanks to the vigilance of our people, including the executive concerned, the incident was prevented.”WPP is investing in AI technology, which will enable the company to reproduce images of its clients’ products at a mass scale for consumers.","Mark Read, the CEO of WPP, has reportedly been targeted by scammers.

Expanding the Google ecosystem

What's in for the developers

Google's annual developer conference, Google I/O 2024 , will kick off on May 14 with a keynote address that promises to showcase the tech giant's latest advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), Android updates, and some new hardware.Building upon last year's AI-centric event, Google is expected to double down on its AI initiatives, focusing strongly on its Gemini platform.Gemini , Google's answer to OpenAI's ChatGPT , will likely take centre stage as the company demonstrates new features and capabilities that could further enhance the AI chatbot we know today.While AI steals the spotlight, Google won't forget its roots in mobile technology. Attendees can expect a deep dive into Android 15 , the latest version of Google's mobile operating system. With the first Android 15 beta already in the hands of developers, Google is poised to unveil a host of new user-facing features designed to enhance productivity, privacy, and security. Android 15 promises to deliver a more polished and efficient mobile experience, from improved notification management to a more refined user interface.Although Google I/O is primarily a software-focused event, the company has been known to surprise audiences with hardware announcements in the past. This year, the Pixel 8a has already been unveiled ahead of the conference, but that doesn't mean Google is out of tricks. Whispers of a potential Pixel Fold 2 or even a teaser for the upcoming Pixel 9 series have been circulating, leaving tech enthusiasts eager to see what Google has up its sleeve.We might also see some new Nest hardware make it to the main stage. A new chromecast, possibly a ‘Pro’ one.In addition to the headline-grabbing announcements, Google I/O 2024 is expected to showcase updates and improvements across the company's vast ecosystem of products and services. From enhancements to Google Maps and Google Workspace to advancements in WearOS and smart home technology - we could hear about the new upgrades coming to them. But, at the end of the day, it’s going to be all about AI.The keynote is what most normal people focus on, but the I/O is a developer galore. Developers can look forward to a wealth of sessions, workshops, and resources designed to help them leverage the latest technologies and best practices in their projects. Whether it's harnessing the power of AI, optimising for Android 15, or integrating with Google's ever-expanding suite of tools, developers are in for new technologies to play with.With AI poised to take centre stage and Android 15 promising a new era of mobile innovation, Google seems ready to set the tone for the coming year at the I/O 2024.","Google's annual developer conference, Google I/O 2024, will kick off on May 14.

"When Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates predicted iPod 'doom', but missed the iPhone boom",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/when-microsoft-co-founder-bill-gates-predicted-ipod-doom-but-missed-the-iphone-boom/articleshow/110061363.cms,"Why Bill Gates prediction seemed way off the mark then

In an interview in May 2004 to a German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Bill Gates , a longtime competitor of Apple , expressed skepticism about the iPod 's long-term dominance. He predicted that mobile phones, with their growing capabilities, would eventually take over as the preferred method for portable music listening.The Microsoft co-founder compared the situation to Apple's earlier success with the Macintosh computer.While initially strong, Apple lost market share in the PC market. He saw a similar trajectory for the iPod. ""As good as Apple may be, I don’t believe the success of the iPod is sustainable in the long run,’ he said in the interview. ""You can make parallels with computers: Apple was very strong in this field before, with its Macintosh and its graphics user interface — like the iPod today — and then lost its position,"" Gates said.At the time, Gates' prediction seemed far-fetched. The iPod was hugely popular, selling millions of units, while mobile phones were generally bulky and lacked the music storage and playback features of a dedicated MP3 player.However, Gates' prediction turned out to be partially correct. Smartphones did eventually become the go-to device for music, offering features like the iPod alongside the ability to make calls, access the internet, and run apps.However, the com[any that played the biggest role in this shift is Apple. One can safely say that the move to smartphones has been spearheaded by Apple. Though initially skeptical of the phone market, Apple released the iPhone in 2007, a device that combined phone functionality with an iPod-like music player and internet access. The iPhone's success far surpassed even the iPod's, revolutionizing the mobile landscape.So, while Gates correctly anticipated the decline of dedicated MP3 players, he underestimated Apple's ability to adapt and dominate the then emerging smartphone market. Till then, Microsoft played a key role in the mobile operating system segment with Windows Phone.","Gates compared the situation to Apple's earlier success with the Macintosh computer.

What consumer court said on the complaint

A consumer court in Ahmedabad has directed food delivery platform Swiggy to compensate a customer for mental harassment caused by a cancelled order. The case dates back to the year 2022.Prasad Kanade, a resident of Bhadra, Ahmedabad, placed an order for sweets on Swiggy in November 2022 but never received it. He paid Rs 549 for the order, but only received a partial refund of Rs 445.Additionally, Swiggy did not inform the customer about the cancellation beforehand.Dissatisfied with the service, Kanade filed a complaint with the Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission. Swiggy argued they acted as an intermediary, connecting customers with restaurants and delivery agents, and shouldn't be held responsible for order issues. The food delivery platform also claimed that Kanade had himself cancelled the order.The commission, however, ruled in Kanade's favour. They pointed out that Swiggy accepted payment for the service, making them a service provider responsible for ensuring a smooth transaction. Consequently, the commission ordered Swiggy to:Refund the remaining Rs 104 with 9% interest.Pay Rs 1,000 as compensation to Prasad Kanade for the mental strain caused as well as for the litigation costs.","A consumer court in Ahmedabad has directed food delivery platform Swiggy to compensate a customer for mental harassment caused by a cancelled order.

"Not just TikTok, these 3 Chinese apps also spy on users across the world; warns Australian study",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/not-just-tiktok-these-3-chinese-apps-also-spy-on-users-across-the-world-warns-australian-study/articleshow/110058401.cms,"Names of Chinese 'spying apps' named in the Australian report

A new report by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) highlights China's potential efforts to gather user data through various social media platforms and online games, not just the widely debated short-video app TikTok. The report has been published in Voice of America.Australian Strategic Policy Institute is a research organisation that receives funding from the Australian government and others overseas.In a report earlier this month, it said, ""Beijing's propaganda chiefs are forging ties with Chinese tech companies to gather personal data from a wide range of social media apps or platforms and popular online games.""The report claims that Chinese authorities are collaborating with tech companies like DiDi (ride-sharing app), Genshin Impact (action game), and Temu (online marketplace) to collect user information. This data, according to ASPI, could be used to understand user preferences, influence global information perception, and ultimately bolster China's international influence.The report emphasises that concerns extend beyond TikTok, which has faced scrutiny over potential data sharing with Chinese authorities. ByteDance, TikTok's parent company, has denied such practices and is challenging a proposed US law that could restrict the platform.While the ASPI report raises concerns, some experts believe it exaggerates the situation. Marina Zhang, an academic specialising in China-Australia relations, argues that linking all social media apps to a coordinated propaganda effort might be an overreach. She advocates for technological collaboration over confrontation, fearing isolation for China if tensions escalate.This news follows Australia's 2023 ban on TikTok on government devices due to security and surveillance anxieties. The ASPI report reignites the debate about the potential reach of China's data collection efforts and the best approach for navigating this complex issue.","A new report by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute highlights China's potential efforts to gather user data through various social media platforms and online games.

WhatsApp has announced a major design refresh for its mobile apps, including a ""darker dark mode,"" a streamlined look, and platform-specific improvements for both Android and Apple iPhone users. According to WhatsApp, the update represents a shift towards a more balanced approach, acknowledging the need for continued functionality while also prioritizing a modern and user-friendly design.This comes after years of primarily focusing on adding new features.One of the most anticipated changes is the ""darker dark mode.""

This bar provides quick access to key sections of the app: Chats, Calls, Communities, and Status Updates.For iPhone users, WhatsApp is revamping the media attachment layout. The previous full-screen menu is replaced with a more concise expandable tray. This should make it easier to select options for sending photos, videos, documents, polls, and other media.The update also includes a refresh of the app's icons, adopting a rounded, outlined style for a more contemporary look. Additionally, the default chat background is getting a revamp, though specific details about the new design haven't been revealed yet.The update is expected to roll out gradually over the coming weeks.

How do these cyber criminals scam people?



Regions impacted by the scam

Online frauds are rapidly on the rise with scammers inventing new tools and methods to dupe people. A report by the Guardian has revealed 76k fake websites that pretended to be designer shops online.In what is being termed as one of the largest scams of its kind, more than 8 lakh people have been scammed into sharing their card details and private information with the fake shop network.As per the report, these fraudsters operated on a large scale in a highly organised and technically savvy setup.The network reportedly originated in Fujian province of China. A data analysis by the Guardian reveals that many of the IP (internet protocol) addresses can be traced back to China, some to the Fujian cities of Putian and Fuzhou. Individuals were hired as developers and data harvesters and paid salaries through Chinese banks.‘There were also three templates for employment contracts, where the employer is listed as Fuzhou Zhongqing Network Technology Co Ltd,’ the report says.The fake shops network was revealed by Security Research Labs (SR Labs), a German cybersecurity consultancy, which shared the data with the Guardian.The scam begins with programmers creating fake web shops offering offers on premium brands like Dior, Nike, Lacoste, Hugo Boss, Versace and Prada. Firstfake website created as part of the scam dates back to 2015. The Guardian report suggests that these websites have been published in multiple languages including English, German, French, Spanish, Swedish and Italian.The report says that more than 1 million orders have been processed in the past three years.While these sites have no connection with the brands, they claim to sell premium goods at discounted prices, luring shoppers into sharing sensitive personal data and bank details. In most cases, consumers did not receive the items they paid for.As per the data analysis done by Guardian, not all payments made on these websites were processed successfully. But the group managed to make about €50 million (about Rs 45 lakhs) over the period.As mentioned before, an estimated 8,00,000 people have been affected by this scam. Majority of them are in the US and Europe. Customers have shared their email addresses, debit and credit card details, including their three-digit security number with these websites along with their names, phone numbers, email and postal addresses.",A report by the Guardian has revealed 76k fake websites that pretended to be designer shops online.

NPCI may extend this UPI deadline and why it’s good news for Google and PhonePe,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/npci-may-extend-this-upi-deadline-and-why-its-good-news-for-google-and-phonepe/articleshow/109983902.cms,"Challenges in introducing incentives for UPI service providers

The National Payments Corporation of India ( NPCI ) is set to extend the deadline for implementing a 30% market share cap on companies processing payments through the Unified Payment Interface ( UPI ) by one to two years, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.This decision is expected to benefit Google Pay and Walmart-backed PhonePe , which currently dominate the UPI payments market.UPI, India's most popular digital payment method in the country, processes over 11 billion transactions per month. PhonePe holds a 48.3% market share, followed by Google Pay at 37.4%, while their closest competitor, Paytm , has seen its share drop to 8% due to regulatory challenges.The NPCI initially planned to enforce the market share cap in January 2021 but postponed the deadline to January 1, 2025. According to sources, a final decision on the extension will be communicated closer to the deadline.The decision to extend the deadline is likely to be criticised by other players in the ecosystem, who have been urging the NPCI to follow through on its commitment. Some companies have proposed solutions, such as incentives that benefit smaller players.The NPCI and the Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) also face challenges in introducing more incentives for UPI service providers. Unlike credit card issuers like Mastercard and Visa, which charge merchants a fee for consumer transactions, UPI essentially functions at no cost to merchants.According to the report, NPCI had hoped that Meta's instant messaging app WhatsApp, which also offers the option for UPI payments, would help break the duopoly. However, the app had only acquired 0.2% market share by April this year.The RBI held a meeting on Wednesday, per the sources, with key players in the UPI ecosystem to discuss strategies for scaling UPI infrastructure, expanding the product portfolio, addressing challenges, and brainstorming solutions to tackle these issues.An NPCI spokesperson declined to comment on all market share questions, and sources say the regulator may make changes to its plan by the end of the year.","The National Payments Corporation of India ( NPCI) is set to extend the deadline for implementing a 30% market share cap on companies processing payments through the Unified Payment Interface ( UPI ) by one to two years.

Fintech platform Paytm , owned by One 97 Communications Ltd has reportedly forayed into ride-hailing service with its new auto-rickshaw booking feature via its app through Open Network for Digital Commerce ( ONDC ).The new service aims to challenge both Ola and Uber , the two companies that currently rule the market.A person close to the development of this feature told Moneycontrol that “There is a lot of software testing and integration that goes into each rollout.There is no reason why Paytm will not also get into cab bookings like Ola and Uber as well at a later stage”.As per the report, the feature is currently in the testing phase and has gone live only for select Paytm users.The Auto-rikshaw booking feature is powered by Namma Yatri to onboard auto-rikshaw drivers on the platform and the services are currently live in Bengaluru, Chennai and the National Capital Region.The feature has been placed under the dedicated Shopping section and select users are seeing the auto rikshaw booking banner within the app. Tapping on the banner redirects users to the auto-booking interface where users can enter pickup and drop locations to book their ride.It is also important to note that the entire ONDC platform on Paytm is backed by PAI Platforms earlier known as Paym Commerce which is backed by Paytm founder and chief Vijay Shekhar Sharma.Other than the auto rikshaw booking, Paytm also facilitates several other services via ONDC, including food delivery, grocery, fashion and electronics.In other news, PaiPai, an ONDC app by PAI Platforms, accidentally got listed on Google Play Store earlier this month, however, it has now been removed.","Auto-rikshaw booking on Paytm is in testing phase and has gone live only for select users.

"Dell introduces colour-coded attendance system, VPN tracking: What Red, Blue mean and more",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/dell-introduces-colour-coded-attendance-system-vpn-tracking-what-red-blue-mean-and-more/articleshow/109983564.cms,"Colour-coded attendance tracking: What does the colours mean

Employees fear more job losses

Dell has announced a new policy that will monitor how often its employees who split their time between the office and home actually show up to work. The company plans to use electronic badge scans , VPN log-ins, and a colour-coded system to keep tabs on employee presence in the office. However, the change, which starts on May 13, as per the Register, has upset many workers who think the rules are too strict and might lead to more people losing their jobs.Under the new policy, employees will be graded based on their presence in the office for at least 39 days per quarter, or approximately three days per week.Dell's human resources software will provide weekly updates on employees' on-site presence, accompanied by colour-coded ratings. A blue flag indicates ""consistent onsite presence,"" green signifies ""regular onsite presence,"" yellow denotes ""some onsite presence,"" and red indicates ""limited onsite presence.""A Dell spokesperson told the Times of India, ""As we've shared, team members globally in hybrid roles will be onsite at a Dell Technologies office at least 39 days per quarter (on average 3 days a week). In today's global technology revolution, we believe in-person connections paired with a flexible approach are critical to driving innovation and value differentiation.""However, the policy has been met with significant backlash from employees.One source familiar with the matter told The Register, ""In the latest Jeff Clarke return-to-grade-school initiative, HR will be keeping an attendance report card on employees, grading them at four levels based on how well they meet the goal of being in the office 39 days a quarter. Employees who do not meet the attendance requirement will have their status escalated up the ladder to Jeff Clarke [the Chief Operating Officer], who apparently believes that being a hall monitor trumps growing revenue.""Another source described the situation as a ""shit show,"" with managers offering inconsistent guidance on the consequences of receiving red flags for limited on-site presence.This new rule follows Dell's statement in February that employees who work from home most of the time might have a harder time getting promoted and are more likely to be fired if the company needs to cut jobs.Some workers think this is a sneaky way to get rid of people, especially women, who are more likely to want to work from home. The company has laid off at least 13,000 people since the start of 2023, with some anticipating further layoffs over the summer.According to sources, approximately half of Dell's U.S. employees and two-thirds of its international workers are classified as remote. One source said, “Dell is tracking badge-ins and VPN connections to ensure employees are onsite when they claim they are (to deter 'coffee badging' or scanning your badge then going immediately home),"" another source told, noting that the company is doing this to quantity how many of the staff are choosing to remain remote after the mandate.The strict tracking of office attendance is a big change from how Dell used to handle remote work before the pandemic. One employee said, ""Even before the pandemic, they never really pushed people to be in the office. They used to say, 'Work happens wherever you make it happen.' The office was often empty a lot of the time, like after lunch or before holidays.""","Dell has announced a new policy that will monitor how often its employees who split their time between the office and home actually show up to work.

Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 may get an AI-powered health update,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-may-get-an-ai-powered-health-update/articleshow/109969985.cms,"AI to convert PPG signals into ECG signals

Samsung is reportedly working on a feature that will use artificial intelligence ( AI ) to detect AFiB (Atrial Fibrillation). The South Korean tech giant has reportedly filed a patent for the same. It is likely that the feature may come with the next generation Galaxy Watch.AFiB is an irregular and often rapid heart rate that can lead to blood clots, strokes and other heart conditions.Over the years, health features have become dominant features on smart wearables, especially smartwatches. Apple introduced its ECG app in 2019 with Apple Watch Series 4 to alert users of irregular heart beats or AFiB. Samsung also allows users to record and monitor ECG (electrocardiogram) data to track heart’s rhythm and health.So then why the need for a new method?Because Samsung seems to believe that the current methods of monitoring are not necessarily accurate.The new patent filed by Samsung suggests that it aims to detect AfiB with the help of generative AI . With the help of AI, photoplethysmograph (PPG) signals will be converted into ECG signals. A PPG signal has several components including volumetric changes in arterial blood which is associated with cardiac activity. It measures the amount of light absorbed and reflected by human tissues.Meanwhile, Samsung is planning to launch a new premium smartwatch. In the financial report for Q1, 2024, the company revealed that it will launch a new premium smartwatch model which will join the Galaxy Watch 7 series.“For smartwatches, the MX Business will strive to meet demand for upgrades through the launch of new premium models,” mentions the company.Although the report didn't specify the exact release date or offer further details, it mentions that the desired upgrades requested by users will be incorporated into the higher-end models.Recent online rumours suggest that Samsung may launch three models of the upcoming Galaxy Watch 7 series.

However, there are several exceptional romance anime series that truly shine above the rest.Here is a curated list of top romance anime series , compiled by Game Rant, along with their respective rankings.Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie stirred mixed reactions upon its debut in Spring 2022, often compared to ""My Dress-Up Darling"" but standing out as a unique slice-of-life anime centred around a charming couple, Shikimori and Yuu Izumi.One distinctive aspect of the series is its portrayal of the main couple already in a relationship, a rarity in anime. While the episodes focus on everyday moments, they paint a wholesome picture of young love with two endearing characters navigating the nuances of romance.Describing Bakemonogatari as a straightforward romance might be a stretch, but this instalment of Monogatari indeed focuses on and highlights the relationship between Koyomi Araragi and Hitagi Senjougahara. Their initial interactions are unconventional, involving a stapler to the face, but Araragi's determination to assist Senjougahara with her curse ultimately brings them closer.Despite the surreal and eccentric nature of Monogatari, the romance between Araragi and Senjougahara is remarkably grounded and healthy. While the series introduces other potential romantic interests, their relationship remains steadfast and central to the narrative.""Sing 'Yesterday' for Me"" presents romance in a refreshingly realistic manner compared to many other anime. The series takes a classic love triangle and steers it in an unexpected direction by the end, resulting in a highly satisfying conclusion that portrays how failed romances can evolve into strong friendships.Directed by Yoshiyuki Fujiwara, known for his work on popular anime like ""Attack on Titan"" and ""Sword Art Online,"" the shift to a show with such a different tone demonstrates his versatility and mastery in storytelling across diverse genres.""My Happy Marriage"" emerged as one of the standout romance anime of Summer 2023, adapted from Akumi Agitogi's novel series. Set in an alternate Meiji Restoration era with supernatural elements, the story follows Miyo, who endures mistreatment from her stepfamily despite her privileged background. Her family arranges her marriage to a notorious military figure known for rejecting wives quickly, with rejection spelling disaster for Miyo. However, Kiyoka surprises everyone by taking an interest in Miyo and becoming incensed by her family's cruelty.The anime delves into the lasting impact of Miyo's abuse, highlighting her struggle to regain self-worth, even with Kiyoka's support. Kiyoka himself is a complex character with hidden motives behind his initial attraction to Miyo, although his feelings for her are genuine.While the romance between Miyo and Kiyoka is heartwarming, ""My Happy Marriage"" falls short in other areas. The supernatural elements can seem disjointed, and the villains are one-dimensional despite being detestable.Based on Fumita Yanagida's popular and finished manga, ""Tomo-chan Is a Girl!"" stood out as one of Winter 2023's most amusing romantic comedies. Tomo and Jun share a close friendship, but Jun sees Tomo strictly as a friend, unaware of her romantic feelings.While romance is central to its characters, ""Tomo-chan Is a Girl!"" leans heavily into comedy. Tomo and Jun's dynamic is charming, and they're supported by entertaining characters like Misuzu and Carol. Despite its comedic tone, the chemistry between Tomo and Jun develops convincingly over the season. Unlike some romance anime, Tomo-chan excels in portraying why its leads are compatible without difficulty.Teen romance anime often dominate the genre, but there are exceptions worth noting. ""Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku"" is primarily a workplace comedy that revolves around two couples: the newly formed pair of Hirotaka Nifuji and Narumi Momose, and the more established couple, Tarou Kabakura and Hanako Koyanagi. The focus remains on Hirotaka and Narumi, with the series emphasising humour over romance, but Tarou and Hanako's relationship is depicted realistically.Despite being childhood friends, Narumi struggles to see Hirotaka as a potential romantic interest, a dynamic that persists throughout the series. The anime's brevity limits the depth of these relationships, but ""Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku"" provides an entertaining journey within its runtime.""Romantic Killer"" cleverly parodies romance and harem anime while paying homage to their core strengths. Anzu, a girl with no interest in boys, is suddenly thrust into a reverse harem scenario by a magical being, disrupting her life of gaming and chocolate consumption. Unamused by her newfound romantic entanglements with unfamiliar guys, Anzu navigates this unconventional situation with scepticism.Primarily a comedy, ""Romantic Killer"" aims to elicit laughter from its audience, often succeeding with its humour rooted in its origins as a shonen manga, characterised by exaggerated facial expressions.Though not always aiming for emotional depth, the anime treats its characters and their relationships seriously. Anzu shines as a compelling lead, and the male characters introduced as potential partners are well-developed. ""Romantic Killer"" offers a delightful blend of humour and romance for those seeking an entertaining and unconventional love story.""The Angel Next Door Spoils Me Rotten"" captivates viewers from the start for several reasons. Firstly, Project No.9's animation is impressive, featuring clean and detailed character designs. Secondly, and most importantly, the main characters exhibit instant chemistry, evident when Amane offers his umbrella to a soaked Mahiru, sparking a connection.Throughout the series, despite the frequent presence of both leads on screen, ""The Angel Next Door Spoils Me Rotten"" effectively delves into their individual personalities while also developing their friendship.Rumiko Takahashi is celebrated as a legendary mangaka, known for classics like Inuyasha, Ranma 1/2, and Urusei Yatsura. While most of her renowned works fall within the shonen genre, Takahashi has also ventured into seinen storytelling. Maison Ikkoku stands out as one of her most mature works, emphasising romance as its primary theme.Unlike Takahashi's prominent shonen series that explore various genres such as comedy and action alongside romance, Maison Ikkoku focuses squarely on romantic elements, enriched with drama, character development, and humour.The central relationship features Kyouko and Yuusaku, both drawn to each other but hindered by their circumstances. Kyouko, grieving the recent loss of her husband, is hesitant to move forward. Meanwhile, Yuusaku, deeply in love with Kyouko, doubts his worthiness as a student. The anime chronicles their journeys of growth, healing, and mutual misunderstanding, complemented by well-developed secondary characters.Insomniacs After School emerged as the standout romance of Spring 2023, adapted from Makoto Ojiro's esteemed seinen manga. The story revolves around two students plagued by insomnia, a burden they carried alone until they met at their school's observatory. Isaki and Ganta form an immediate bond, which deepens as they work together to revive the Astronomy Club, driven by their shared need to preserve their newfound sanctuary.The anime boasts impeccable pacing, skillfully depicting the protagonists' isolation due to insomnia and the subtle solace they find in each other. While romance is a central theme, the series prioritises developing Ganta and Isaki's friendship before advancing their relationship, emphasising the depth of their connection beyond shared circumstances.Kokoro Connect injects a supernatural twist into a classic love triangle scenario. The story centers around Taichi, Iori, Yui, Yoshifumi, and Himeko, students of the Student Cultural Research Club, whose lives take a turn when they receive supernatural abilities from a mysterious being named Heartseed.As they grapple with these newfound powers, the group experiences sensory phenomena that challenge their relationships and reveal hidden aspects of their personalities. The anime is rich in character development, providing an engaging and thought-provoking experience.Maid Sama! carries many tropes that might derail other romance anime: an overly perfect male lead, a strong female protagonist reduced to a damsel, and an unnecessary love triangle. Despite these shortcomings, Maid Sama! shines through its strong personality.The heart of Maid Sama! lies in the relationship between Takumi Usui, a charming heartthrob, and Misaki Ayuzawa, a strict student council president with a busy schedule balancing school, home, and work. When Takumi discovers Misaki's secret job at a maid cafe, it opens a new perspective on the usually composed president.In ""Rascal Does Not Dream Of Bunny Girl Senpai,"" romance plays a subtle yet compelling role that defines the series. The story centers on Sakuta Azusagawa, a high school student drawn to girls suffering from Adolescence Syndrome, a condition linked to their insecurities.While the anime unfolds through different arcs focusing on various girls, the standout is the initial saga featuring Mai Sakurajima, an actress who forms a close bond with Sakuta. Their dynamic crackles with romantic tension, warmth, and clever banter. Although not always in the foreground, their relationship develops steadily across subsequent arcs, leading to a satisfying sequel in the form of a feature film.Wakana Gojou and Marin Kitagawa inhabit completely contrasting worlds. Gojou, isolated and reserved, keeps himself apart from others due to his passion for hina dolls, fearing ridicule. In contrast, Kitagawa is popular, outgoing, and self-assured.Despite their differences, Kitagawa becomes intrigued by cosplay and sees Gojou as the ideal person to create outfits for her. ""My Dress-Up Darling"" is a charming, humorous, and beautifully animated romance anime that excels in executing classic genre tropes with finesse.""Toradora!"" is a beloved slice-of-life romantic comedy that offers a wonderful entry point into the genre. The story revolves around Ryuji Yusaku and Taiga Aisaka, two students who have crushes on each other's best friends.Both Ryuji and Taiga are viewed as outcasts—Ryuji due to his intimidating appearance and Taiga because of her fiery temper. They team up to assist each other in their romantic pursuits. The series delves into their evolving dynamic and the humorous mishaps that ensue as they navigate their intertwined love lives.""The Pet Girl of Sakurasou"" depicts the journey of an eccentric group of characters as they navigate growth and self-discovery. Sorata Kanda is forced to move into the unconventional Sakura House after being kicked out of his school's main dorms.In Sakura House, Sorata encounters talented yet troubled students. When a peculiar young artist joins the dorm, Sorata takes on the responsibility of helping her adjust to her new life. The series delves into the interactions among the dorm mates, their personal aspirations, and the interconnected nature of their relationships.""Ouran High School Host Club"" is a delightful reverse harem anime filled with lighthearted and meaningful moments. Haruhi Fujioka accidentally breaks an antique vase belonging to her school's Host Club and must repay her debt by disguising herself as a boy and working as a host.The series excels in developing Haruhi's character along with her fellow hosts, providing insight into their motivations and personalities. It's a must-watch for shojo fans, featuring a memorable cast of characters that carries the show through its run.Kyoto Animation has produced many beloved anime, and ""Love, Chunibyo & Other Delusions!"" is among them. The series centers around a phenomenon known as Chunibyo, where adolescents have grandiose and unrealistic delusions.Yuta Togashi, who has outgrown his delusional phase, aims for a normal high school life. However, things take a turn when his classmate, Rikka Takanashi, reminds him of his past and tries to pull him back into the world of Chunibyo with her own delusions. The series delves into their relationship as Yuta unravels the triggers behind Rikka's delusions.The trope of opposites attracting may be overused, but when done well, it can lead to a captivating romantic comedy. ""Kimi ni Todoke"" explores the endearing friendship between the shy Sawako Kuronuma and the popular Shouta Kazehaya. Sawako, often mistaken for Sadako from ""The Ring,"" is isolated at school due to her appearance, making it challenging for her to break out of her shell. Fortunately, Kazehaya is just the right person to help her.""Kimi ni Todoke"" is a delightful and heartwarming anime with well-developed characters who evolve as the story unfolds. While it adheres to typical romance anime pacing, the journey remains engaging and enjoyable.Unlike most romance stories that focus on the process of falling in love, ""Tonikawa: Over The Moon For You"" follows a married couple who have already reached that point. As a result, the anime adopts a slice-of-life approach, showcasing Nasa and Tsukasa's daily life and antics rather than a typical romantic journey. ""Tonikawa"" doesn't rely on dramatic highs but instead offers a pleasant and light-hearted experience.While this anime may not appeal to everyone, it serves as a refreshing departure from more melodramatic romance shows. Despite their tendency to blush at the slightest physical contact, Nasa and Tsukasa are refreshingly direct in expressing their feelings, making them both witty and likeable characters.This romantic anime shines because of its main character, Takeo Gouda. His towering, imposing presence contrasts beautifully with his heartfelt affection for the delicate Rinko, which is truly heartwarming. Takeo's efforts to play matchmaker for Rinko with his best friend, despite his own feelings, demonstrate his genuine kindness.Viewers will undoubtedly root for Takeo and Rinko's endearing relationship. ""My Love Story!!"" delivers the goods without delay, as the main characters are dating for most of the episodes, bypassing the typical slow build-up to a confession.""A Sign of Affection"" is a heartwarming romantic comedy centred on college-age love and the challenges of communication. While not the sole focus of the story, Yuki and Itsuomi stand out as the main couple, instantly captivating viewers. Yuki, who is hearing-impaired, communicates using sign language, text, and by reading lips, while Itsuomi is a world traveller passionate about learning languages. Their connection begins on a train and grows stronger with each subsequent encounter.The anime beautifully captures the intense emotions of falling in love, highlighted by a poignant moment in the opening episode. With an older cast, ""A Sign of Affection"" takes on a more mature tone compared to typical romance anime. Throughout the season, Yuki and Itsuomi become increasingly comfortable around each other, resulting in consistently endearing interactions.This romantic anime is ideal for LGBTQ+ viewers seeking representation on screen, but its well-crafted storytelling makes it enjoyable for all audiences. The heartwarming romance blossoms between Mafuyu and Ritsuka as Mafuyu learns to play guitar and sing in Ritsuka's band.Watching Mafuyu's growing confidence alongside the romantic tension creates a compelling series that's hard to resist. The accompanying movie is also outstanding and a must-watch continuation of the series.Nana is one of the most renowned and beloved shoujo anime of all time, a must-watch for fans of romance and beyond. The series follows two women named Nana, seemingly different but navigating curiously similar life situations that lead to separate outcomes.Without giving away how their stories intertwine, Nana's 47 episodes delve into the protagonists' perspectives on love through various relationships. Grounded in reality, the anime explores complex characters who, despite occasional extremes, face accountability for their actions.Your Lie in April, one of the most famous romance anime, revolves around two music prodigies: Kousei Arima and Kaori Miyazono. Kousei, grappling with depression after his mother's death, loses his passion for the piano and withdraws from the performance arts. One day, he hears Kaori playing her violin with such freedom that it reignites his love for music and sparks his admiration for her.The anime delves into themes of grief, life, love, and music. Kousei's journey toward self-healing is profound, marked by heartbreak, but also punctuated by moments of beauty, tenderness, and joy.In this anime, Miyuki and Kaguya engage in a battle of wits to avoid confessing their love first, using their intellect and skills to outmaneuver each other. Both are determined not to be seen as the one who gives in.Their antics running the student council at an elite school with their friends are uproariously funny yet also contain heartwarming moments that will make viewers cheer. Season 3 of Kaguya-sama: Love is War, which aired in Spring 2022, leaned heavily into comedy but also devoted more time to developing Miyuki and Kaguya's relationship and touching on other romances.If the anime follows the manga, the next season of Love is War promises to be predominantly romantic. If successful, this upcoming release could elevate Kaguya-sama to the pinnacle of romance anime.This anime consists of two parts: Clannad and After Story. The latter surpasses the former by a wide margin, but watching Clannad is essential to fully appreciate the impact of After Story. While it features a diverse cast of supporting characters, the heart of the show revolves around Tomoya Okazaki and Nagisa Furukawa, delivering a profound narrative.Unlike typical romance series, Clannad After Story unfolds beyond high school, depicting the growth of Tomoya and Nagisa as individuals and as a couple. The anime tackles real-life challenges without glossing over them, offering a genuine exploration of common struggles.The Dangers in My Heart is truly brilliant. At first glance, it may seem like another typical shounen romance where a popular girl falls for an ordinary loner guy. These stories often offer little beyond wish fulfilment, and The Dangers in My Heart initially appears to fit that mould. Yet, the anime stands out.Ichikawa is an average guy with few friends who daydreams about unusual things. While the anime doesn't delve deeply into these thoughts, it doesn't ignore them either, leaving Ichikawa with a poor first impression. On the other hand, Anna is a cheerful but shy girl who loves food and works as a model. After a chance encounter at the school library, the two start spending time together, developing a friendship that hints at something deeper. Anna encourages Ichikawa to break out of his shell, leading to significant changes in him over the course of two seasons.Although slow-paced initially, The Dangers in My Heart evolves into something special by the end of season 1, maintaining its momentum in the subsequent cour and establishing itself as one of the best romance anime of all time. Anna and Ichikawa are both exceptional characters, but Anna's depth is what elevates the show. She's not just an idealised plot device; she's a fully realised character with insecurities, quirks, and vulnerabilities. Her interest in Ichikawa feels genuine, and vice versa. This is a rare quality in romance anime.Fruits Basket is the definitive romance anime, masterfully blending drama and comedy. Tooru Honda, a lovable protagonist, faces life's challenges until she moves in with the Souma family. The Soumas, particularly Yuki, are school idols hiding a shocking secret that alters perceptions.Love triangles often lack depth, favouring one partner over the other. Fruits Basket defies this norm with its compelling love triangle, where each character is fully developed. Across three seasons, Fruits Basket takes viewers on an unforgettable journey.Also read | 15 best anime series of all time; here's the list","Japanese animation has delivered numerous romantic tales, ranging from light- hearted comedies to deeply emotional dramas.

During summer months, many households experience a significant increase in electricity consumption due to higher cooling needs. While staying comfortable during hot weather is essential, it doesn't have to come at the cost of soaring electricity bills. By implementing strategic energy-saving practices, you can reduce your summer electricity expenses without sacrificing comfort.Here you can explore several effective ways to save on summer electricity bills, offering practical tips and strategies that can help you minimise energy consumption and lower your utility costs during the warmer months.From optimising your cooling system to adopting energy-efficient habits, these recommendations are designed to make a noticeable impact on your electricity expenses while keeping your home cool and comfortable.Let's delve into these actionable tips that can help you save money and energy throughout the summer season.The Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) issues BEE Star Labels as a voluntary method for manufacturers to indicate an appliance's energy efficiency. The label uses stars to indicate the efficiency of a product, with more stars indicating higher efficiency. Simply put, the higher the energy efficiency rating of the appliance, the lower its energy consumption. To effectively reduce your home's energy costs, opt for appliances with a 5-star BEE rating. Not only does this positively impact the environment, but it also helps lower your electricity bills. Explore Crompton's wide range of 5-star rated ceiling fans to learn more about BEE Rating Appliances.If your home still uses CFLs and incandescent bulbs, it's time to replace them with LED bulbs. LED bulbs are not just a trendy choice; they are recognized for their energy efficiency and superior illumination. If you're wondering how to reduce your electricity bill at home, switching to LED bulbs is the solution for you.Upgrading to smart appliances is a highly effective method to decrease electricity consumption at home. These devices allow you to automate tasks and manage energy usage efficiently. Consider installing energy-efficient ceiling fans to further reduce electricity consumption. Smart appliances typically come equipped with remote control capabilities, allowing you to schedule operations and conserve power. Crompton offers remote-controlled fans designed for enhanced energy savings and lower power consumption.These energy-efficient fans are gaining popularity due to their brushless direct current motors (BLDC), which operate on direct current electricity. They can help save up to 60% on electricity compared to normal induction motor-based fans. Additionally, they offer convenient features like remote control for turning the fan on and off, timer functionality, and compatibility with voice assistants. To learn more about the differences between BLDC fans and normal fans and how they can help reduce electricity bills, explore further information on BLDC fans versus conventional fans.Implementing a full solar power system for your home can be a substantial investment. However, there are more accessible and cost-effective ways to leverage solar energy. Installing outdoor solar lights in your balcony and garden, along with solar fans, can notably reduce your energy expenses at a modest cost. Additionally, using solar pumps for daily tasks can contribute to electricity savings. It's beneficial to understand the distinction between an electric geyser and a solar geyser to make an informed choice for your energy needs.Maintain your air conditioner at 24 degrees Celsius to optimise cooling and conserve energy during the summer months, effectively lowering electricity costs. Additionally, using a timer to automate AC operation and upgrading to a 5-star BEE-rated model can further enhance energy efficiency and reduce expenses associated with cooling your space.Numerous advanced smart energy metres are currently offered in the market.
