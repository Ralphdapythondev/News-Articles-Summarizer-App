HCL Tech has announced a 7% salary hike for its employees, effective October 2024 . Top performers at the company are set to receive raises of up to 12-15%, according to Chief People Officer Ramachandran Sundararajan.The salary increase comes as HCL Tech reported an 11% year-on-year rise in net profit to Rs 4,235 crore for the second quarter ended September 30, 2024.Revenue from operations grew by 8.2% to Rs 28,862 crore compared to the same period last year.Sundararajan stated that the wage hikes are expected to have a minimal impact on the company's operating margins in the December quarter. HCL Tech is actively working to offset the impact through efficiency measures.The number of employees eligible for the hike will depend on the company's review cycle and the proportion of lateral hires who become eligible after completing a year of service. As of Q2, HCL Tech's headcount stood at 218,621, a decrease of 780 employees from the previous quarter.This move follows the company's established annual compensation review process. It comes at a time when several major Indian IT companies have shifted wage hikes to the third quarter of FY25 to manage costs and sustain profitability amidst a sluggish demand environment.HCL Tech's Q2 performance exceeded market expectations, with EBIT margin coming in at 18.6%, growing 149 basis points sequentially.

Nvidia back to challenge Apple as world's most-valuable company; analysts see 'Prisoner's Dilemma' of IT companies behind the rally,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-back-to-challenge-apple-as-worlds-most-valuable-company-analysts-see-prisoners-dilemma-of-it-companies-behind-the-rally/articleshow/114227786.cms,"Just behind Apple and ahead of Microsoft

Analysts at TD Cowen told news agency Reuters that these companies are caught in a ""

Prisoner's Dilemma

,"" where the fear of falling behind drives continued investment in AI. They reiterated their ""Top Pick"" rating for Nvidia, with a price target of $165.

Nvidia's stock continued its upward trajectory, reaching near-record highs on Monday. This surge positions the AI chipmaker to potentially overtake Apple as the world's most valuable company. Nvidia has been the biggest beneficiary of the AI boom, as companies including Meta, Google, Microsoft and Oracle continue to unveil technologies and products that require hige investments in its graphics processing units, or GPUs .Following a brief and sudden dip in late August and early September, Nvidia share has rebounded sharply. Investors are betting on strong demand for Nvidia's upcoming Blackwell AI processors. The company's shares climbed 2.8% to $138.57, just shy of the all-time high of $140.76 reached in June.Nvidia's market capitalization now stands at $3.4 trillion, trailing Apple's $3.5 trillion but surpassing Microsoft's $3.1 trillion. This rapid growth is fueled by the intense competition among tech giants like Alphabet, Microsoft, and Amazon to dominate the emerging AI landscape.As investors anticipate quarterly earnings reports, Apple and Microsoft also saw gains. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, Nvidia's key manufacturing partner, is expected to report a significant increase in quarterly profits due to strong AI demand.While Nvidia's success has lifted the broader market, there are concerns about a potential slowdown in AI spending that could dampen investor enthusiasm.","N Nvidia's market capitalization now stands at $3.4 trillion.

AI introduces new vulnerabilities: Governor Das

Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) Governor Shaktikanta Das has again cautioned against the potential dangers associated with artificial intelligence (AI) in the financial sector. Speaking at the 90th High-Level Conference in New Delhi on October 14, Das said that heavy reliance on AI may pose systemic risks.Das said that while AI is transforming the financial sector, these technologies also introduce potential risks to financial stability.""Latest technological advancements such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have opened new avenues of business and profit expansion for financial institutions. At the same time, these technologies also pose financial stability risks,"" he said.He noted that the increasing use of AI might allow a few technology providers to dominate the market, which could pose systemic risks.""The heavy reliance on AI can lead to concentration risks, especially when a small number of tech providers dominate the market. This could amplify systemic risks, as failures or disruptions in these systems may cascade across the entire financial sector.The Governor pointed out that AI introduces vulnerabilities, including increased susceptibility tocyberattacks and data breaches .""Moreover, the growing use of AI introduces new vulnerabilities, such as increased susceptibility to cyberattacks and data breaches. Additionally, AI's opacity makes it difficult to audit or interpret the algorithms which drive decisions. This could potentially lead to unpredictable consequences in the markets,"" Das noted.Banks and other financial institutions are urged to place adequate risk mitigation measures against these risks.“In the ultimate analysis, banks have to ride on the advantages of AI and Bigtech and not allow the latter to ride on them,” he added.","RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das has again cautioned against the potential dangers associated with artificial intelligence (AI) in the financial sector.

Chief Justice Manmohan warned, ""This page will have to be taken down, otherwise you will not hear. You have put learned single-judge in line of fire.""The bench further cautioned Wikipedia's legal representatives, stating, ""You may be world's powerful entity but we live in a country which is governed by law and we take pride in that,"" as reported by Live Law.At issue is Wikipedia's refusal to disclose the identities of users who allegedly made defamatory edits to ANI's Wikipedia page.

Other Internet Archive services are temporarily offline.

The Internet Archive , a non-profit digital library that provides free access to digitised content and home to the popular Wayback Machine , is back after it was hit by a major data breach last week. However, the founder of the organisation has said that the platform is now back online in a “provisional, read-only manner"".“Safe to resume but might need further maintenance, in which case it will be suspended again,” founder Brewster Kahle said, as per The Verge.Last week, The Internet Archive was hit by distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, exposing personal information of 31 million users.The breach was first discovered when visitors to archive.org were shown a JavaScript alert stating: ""Have you ever felt like the Internet Archive runs on sticks and is constantly on the verge of suffering a catastrophic security breach? It just happened. See 31 million of you on HIBP!""A pro-Palestinian hacktivist group called SN_BLACKMETA has claimed responsibility for the attack.Reportedly, users can access the Wayback Machine to search 916 billion web pages that have been archived over time, however, users can’t currently capture an existing web page into the archive. The following message now reads on the website:The hack was confirmed by Have I Been Pwned, a website that tracks data breaches. In response to the attack, the Internet Archive took its services offline to investigate and strengthen its security. Over the past few days, the organisation has been gradually restoring services, including email accounts and crawlers for National Libraries.This incident occurred just weeks after Google began incorporating links to the Wayback Machine, the Internet Archive's digital archive of websites, in its search results.

Government has announced these 'Chinese restrictions' on pocket lighters,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/government-has-announced-these-chinese-restrictions-on-pocket-lighters/articleshow/114218352.cms,"What the DGFT order says

Why the Big ban

In an effort to reduce dependence on Chinese imports and promote domestic manufacturing, the Indian government has imposed a ban on the import of pocket lighter parts. The Directorate General of Foreign Trade ( DGFT ) issued a notification on October 13, restricting the import of these components with immediate effect.The ban is expected to have a significant impact on the import of lighter parts, which primarily originate from China.""Import of parts of pocket lighters , gas fuelled, non-refillable or refillable lighters ( cigarette lighters )... is restricted with immediate effect,"" the directorate general of foreign trade (DGFT) said in a notification.Imports of cigarette lighters, under Rs 20, is already prohibited. The import ban is also there on pocket lighters, gas-fuelled, non-refillable or refillable.This move comes on the heels of previous import restrictions on cigarette lighters and the introduction of quality standards for flame-producing lighters. The government aims to curb the influx of substandard products and encourage domestic production.While China remains the dominant supplier, other countries like Spain, Turkey, and the UAE also contribute to India's lighter imports. The decision to ban lighter parts also aligns with the Indian government's broader strategy to reduce its trade deficit with China. Despite efforts to increase exports, India's trade deficit with its neighbor has been on the rise in recent years. By restricting imports of certain products, the government hopes to promote domestic self-sufficiency and reduce its reliance on foreign suppliers.In September 2022, Tamil Nadu Chief Minister MK Stalin had urged the Centre to ban single use plastic cigarette lighters to help the domestic matchbox industry. These plastic cigarette lighters, which are legally and illegally imported from countries like China, are available for Rs 10 and can substitute 20 matchboxes. Further, these non-refillable lighters result in immense plastic waste, damaging the environment and also impacting health, he had said.In the first four months of the current fiscal year, India imported lighter parts worth $3.8 million, down from $4.86 million in 2023-24.","The ban is expected to have a significant impact on the import of lighter parts, which primarily originate from China.

"What is Masked Aadhaar and why you should use it only for KYC or as identity proof in hotels, airports, banks and other places",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/what-is-masked-aadhaar-and-why-you-should-use-it-only-for-kyc-or-as-identity-proof-in-hotels-airports-banks-and-other-places/articleshow/114217810.cms,"What is Masked Aadhaar and why citizens should use it

Key features of Masked Aadhaar:

Increased privacy: Protects Aadhaar number from unauthorised access.

Reduced risk of fraud: Makes it more difficult for criminals to misuse Aadhaar information.

Equally valid: Just as acceptable as other Aadhaar formats (Aadhaar letter, PVC card, eAadhaar, mAadhaar).

Easy to obtain: Can be downloaded online from the UIDAI website.

How to download Masked Aadhaar

Visit the official UIDAI website at https://uidai.gov.in/.

Click on “Download Aadhaar” under “My Aadhaar” section,

In the new page, enter 12-digit Aadhaar number or 16-digit Virtual ID (VID), along with other required details.

In the “Select your preference” section, choose the “Masked Aadhaar” option.

Select the option to receive an One-Time Password (OTP) on your registered mobile number.

Enter the OTP to complete the verification process.

Masked Aadhaar will then be available for download in a password-protected PDF format.

Aadhaar-based fraud , where criminals use stolen Aadhaar numbers for financial gain or unauthorised access to services, is a growing concern, reports have suggested. In order to curb the misuse of Aadhaar numbers, the Unique Identification Authority of India ( UIDAI ) introduced masked Aadhaar . Here's all you need to know about it.Masked Aadhaar has been introduced by the UIDAI to enhance your privacy and reduce the risk of Aadhaar misuse .It hides the first eight digits (of the total 12) of Aadhaar number, replacing them with 'X's. This prevents others from seeing your full Aadhaar number while still allowing citizens to use it for identification purposes.The need for using Masked Aadhaar emerges as criminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to bypass traditional security measures like OTPs and bank details to scam citizens by exploiting the Aadhaar Enabled Payment System (AePS). Fraudsters are using techniques like silicon fingerprints and unauthorised devices to duplicate Aadhaar-linked biometrics, allowing them to steal money directly from victims' bank accounts.In order to download Masked Aadhar, you can follow these steps:","Masked Aadhaar has been introduced by the UIDAI to enhance your privacy and reduce the risk of Aadhaar misuse.

Here's what not to do to protect yourself:

How to stay safe:

Gmail users beware! A kind of phishing scam is targeting inboxes, and this time, they might be smarter than ever. According to a recent report by The Forbes, scammers are utilising AI-powered techniques to craft highly personalised and convincing emails, making them more difficult to detect.These scams typically operate by mimicking legitimate sources like banks, social media platforms, or even Google itself.The emails might contain details specific to your online activity or personal information gleaned from data breaches , creating a false sense of trust.Scammers then urge you to click on a suspicious link or divulge your login credentials. Once you do, they gain access to your account and wreak havoc, potentially stealing sensitive data or hijacking other accounts linked to your Gmail.The use of AI in these scams makes them particularly dangerous. AI algorithms can analyse large amounts of data and identify patterns in email communication. This allows scammers to craft emails with personalised language and details that resonate with the recipient, increasing the likelihood of falling victim to the scam.* Clicking unfamiliar links: Never click on links embedded in emails from unknown senders. Verify the sender's email address and hover over the link to see the actual website it directs you to before clicking.* Sharing login information: Legitimate companies will never request login details through email. If an email claims to be from Google or another platform and asks for your password, it's a scam!* Rushing to respond: Scammers often use urgency to manipulate you. Don't panic! Take your time to verify the sender and information in the email before taking any action.* Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): Adding an extra layer of security, 2FA requires a code from your phone or another device to log in, even if someone has your password.* Beware of spoofed emails: Scammers can create email addresses that closely resemble legitimate companies. Look out for misspellings or unusual domains in the sender's email address.* Report phishing attempts: If you receive a suspicious email, report it to Google! This helps them track and block similar attempts in the future."," AI algorithms analyse large amounts of data and identify patterns in email communication.

At the event, the robots showcased their ability to serve drinks, dance, sing birthday song and even play rock paper scissors with the attendees. But what many viewers assumed to be cutting-edge AI-powered machines turned out to be something entirely different.One of the attendees - Robert Scoble @Scobleizer posted on microblogging site X (formerly Twitter) stating that the robots were remote controlled by ‘humans’.In one of the posts, he wrote “Optimus make me a drink, please. This is not wholly AI. A human is remote assisting. Which means AI day next year where we will see how fast Optimus is learning.” He also shared a video of the robot serving drinks, and chatting with the guests at the event.He later clarified that an engineer had told him the robots used AI to walk. He wrote “I talked with an engineer. When it walked that is AI running Optimus. It is real impressive they brought so many out in crowds at @tesla’s event.”In another video, one of the robots confirms that it is assisted by a human, adding that it’s not fully autonomous. When asked by a guest if it is remotely controlled, the robot replies ““Today, I am assisted by a human”, adding “I am not yet fully autonomous”.During the event, Musk said that Optimus could be priced between $20,000 (approx. Rs 16,81,404) to $30,000, making it potentially accessible to a broad consumer market. ""I think everyone among the 8 billion people on Earth will want an Optimus buddy,"" he claimed, highlighting the robot's potential for widespread adoption.","Elon Musk unveiled the latest version of his humanoid robot - Optimus.

Government to Ola: Must offer refund choices and ride bills,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/government-to-ola-must-offer-refund-choices-and-ride-bills/articleshow/114201135.cms,"Let customers choose preferred method of refund: CCPA

Not issuing bill amount to 'unfair trade practice’

Bhavish Aggarwal-led cab aggregator Ola has been directed by the Indian government to implement a mechanism, allowing customers to choose their preferred method of refund. The Central Consumer Protection Authority ( CCPA ) under the Ministry of Consumer Affairs Food and Public Distribution has asked the ride hailing platform to offer a bill, receipt, or invoice for every auto ride booked through its platform.According to the National Consumer Helpline (NCH) data, 2,061 complaints have been registered against Ola from January 1, 2024, till October 9. Top complaints against Ola included charging higher fares than those displayed at the time of booking, failure to refund amounts owed to customers, drivers demanding extra cash, and drivers either failing to reach the correct location or dropping passengers at the wrong destination.The consumer watchdog has directed Ola to offer consumers the option to choose between refunds being credited directly to their bank accounts or provided as coupons during the grievance redressal process. The regulator observed that at present when a customer raises any grievance on the Ola app, Ola only provided a coupon code which could be used for the next ride without providing a clear choice to the consumer to opt between a bank account refund or a coupon.CCPA Chief Commissioner Nidhi Khare said that ""This violates consumer rights and the no-question-asked refund policy cannot mean that the company incentivises people to simply use this facility for taking another ride,"".In its directive, the regulator says that if a consumer attempts to access an invoice for Auto rides booked on Ola, the app shows the message “Customer invoice for Auto rides will not be provided due to changes in Ola's auto service T&Cs”.CCPA observed that not issuing a bill or invoice or receipt for the goods sold or services offered constitutes an ""unfair trade practice"" under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019. It has directed the cab aggregator to offer bill to its customers.","Not issuing bill amount to 'unfair trade practice' says consumer watchdog. 2,061 complaints have been registered against Ola from January 1, 2024, till October 9. Top complaints against OLA included charging higher fares than those displayed at the time of booking.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114201139,imgsize-1510052,width-400,resizemode-4/114201139.jpg"
