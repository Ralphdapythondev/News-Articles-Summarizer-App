Government to Ola: Must offer refund choices and ride bills,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/government-to-ola-must-offer-refund-choices-and-ride-bills/articleshow/114201135.cms,"Let customers choose preferred method of refund: CCPA

Not issuing bill amount to 'unfair trade practice’

Bhavish Aggarwal-led cab aggregator Ola has been directed by the Indian government to implement a mechanism, allowing customers to choose their preferred method of refund. The Central Consumer Protection Authority ( CCPA ) under the Ministry of Consumer Affairs Food and Public Distribution has asked the ride hailing platform to offer a bill, receipt, or invoice for every auto ride booked through its platform.According to the National Consumer Helpline (NCH) data, 2,061 complaints have been registered against Ola from January 1, 2024, till October 9. Top complaints against Ola included charging higher fares than those displayed at the time of booking, failure to refund amounts owed to customers, drivers demanding extra cash, and drivers either failing to reach the correct location or dropping passengers at the wrong destination.The consumer watchdog has directed Ola to offer consumers the option to choose between refunds being credited directly to their bank accounts or provided as coupons during the grievance redressal process. The regulator observed that at present when a customer raises any grievance on the Ola app, Ola only provided a coupon code which could be used for the next ride without providing a clear choice to the consumer to opt between a bank account refund or a coupon.CCPA Chief Commissioner Nidhi Khare said that ""This violates consumer rights and the no-question-asked refund policy cannot mean that the company incentivises people to simply use this facility for taking another ride,"".In its directive, the regulator says that if a consumer attempts to access an invoice for Auto rides booked on Ola, the app shows the message “Customer invoice for Auto rides will not be provided due to changes in Ola's auto service T&Cs”.CCPA observed that not issuing a bill or invoice or receipt for the goods sold or services offered constitutes an ""unfair trade practice"" under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019. It has directed the cab aggregator to offer bill to its customers.","Not issuing bill amount to 'unfair trade practice' says consumer watchdog. 2,061 complaints have been registered against Ola from January 1, 2024, till October 9.

What is THAAD defense battery system

Raging war in Middle east

The United States (US) is sending its advanced anti-missile system -- Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) battery -- to Israel , along with US troops to operate it. The Pentagon made the announcement on Sunday, October 13, just hours after Iran warned the US to keep its military forces out of Israel. Pentagon spokesman Major General Pat Ryder said in a statement that Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin authorized the deployment of the THAAD battery at the direction of President Joe Biden The THAAD battery system has been developed by the US Missile Defense Agency and is operated by the Army.Ryder said that the air defense system will help bolster Israel’s air defenses following Iran’s missile attacks on Israel in April and October.This means that for the first time the US soldiers could actively engage in fighting between Israel and Iran on Israeli soil in the ongoing conflict that started after Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, 2023.According to a report in news agency Associated Press, the THAAD is a defensive system that shoots down incoming ballistic missiles. US is reportedly sending THAAD with the aim to add another layer to Israel's already significant air defenses, which include separate systems designed to intercept long-range, medium-range and short-range threats. Israel recently retired its US-made Patriot systems after decades of use.The THAAD is considered a complementary system to the Patriot, but it can defend a wider area. It can hit targets at ranges of 150 to 200 kilometers (93 to 124 miles), and is used to destroy short-range, medium-range and limited intermediate-range ballistic missile threats that are either inside or outside the atmosphere.The AP report, quoting an April report by the Congressional Research Service, said that the US Army has seven THAAD batteries. Generally each consists of six truck-mounted launchers, 48 interceptors, radio and radar equipment and requires 95 soldiers to operate.Israel is widely believed to be preparing a military response to Iran's October 1 attack when it fired roughly 180 missiles into Israel. Media reports suggest that Israel has been escalating its campaign against Hezbollah with waves of heavy airstrikes across Lebanon and a ground invasion at the border after a year of exchanges of fire.(With agency inputs)","The THAAD battery system has been developed by the US Missile Defense Agency and is operated by the Army.

US to send THAAD defense battery to Israel

Iran is reportedly grappling with a significant wave of cyberattacks targeting government agencies and critical infrastructure. The cyberattacks, which are said to have started on Saturday, have disrupted government operations and raised concerns about national security.The cyber assaults followed Israel's vow to retaliate against Iran for a recent missile barrage that targeted Israeli targets.As tensions continue to rise in the region, with conflicts intensifying in Gaza and Lebanon, Iran has found itself under increasing pressure both domestically and internationally.Abolhassan Firouzabadi , a former secretary of Iran's Supreme Council for Cyberspace, confirmed the cyberattacks, stating that sensitive information was stolen from targeted infrastructure. ""Nearly all three branches of Iran's government – the judiciary, the legislature, and the executive branch – have been hit by heavy cyberattacks, and their information was stolen,"" Firouzabadi told Iran International. ""Our nuclear facilities have also been targeted by cyberattacks, as well as networks like fuel distribution, municipal networks, transportation networks, ports, and similar sectors.""In response to the cyber threat, Iran's Civil Aviation Organization has announced a ban on electronic communication devices, such as pagers and walkie-talkies, on airplanes in cabins or checked baggage, except for mobile phones. This measure was taken as a precautionary step to mitigate potential risks associated with these devices, which could be exploited for malicious purposes.The US is sending a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense battery to Israel, along with US troops to operate it.

"Amazon fined Rs 18,000 for not refunding Rs 40,000 to woman whose phone was 'hacked': Here's what the court said",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/amazon-fined-rs-18000-for-not-refunding-rs-40000-to-woman-whose-phone-was-hacked-heres-what-court-said/articleshow/114194535.cms,"What Amazon said or the court order

What Consumer Commission said

A consumer court ruled in favour of a Chandigarh resident who faced financial losses due to fraudulent transactions on Amazon website. The District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission has ordered Amazon Retail India Pvt. Ltd. to refund Rs 40,325 to Samita Das, a resident of Sector 12, Chandigarh. The commission has also directed it to pay Rs 10,000 to the complainant as compensation for causing mental agony and harassment and Rs 8,000 as cost of litigation.The incident occurred in September 2023 when fraudsters gained access to Das's personal information and placed unauthorised orders on her Amazon account.The complainant said that her smartphone was hacked. Consequently, her e-mail ID and ICICI Bank credit card were also hacked, and misused by the fraudsters on September 9, 2023. Das claimed that despite repeated attempts to cancel the transactions and alert Amazon to the suspicious activity, the company failed to take timely action.She said that initially suspecting fraudulent activity, the orders were cancelled and she was informed via email. However, certain other orders placed by the fraudsters thereafter were entertained by the company without verifying the credentials and a demand was raised against her Amazon Pay Later Account. Subsequently, the orders were cancelled and refund was assured by Amazon, but till date the amount has not been refunded, she said. Amazon India and Amazon Pay Later, in their reply, reportedly said, “The complainant contacted our customer support team wherein all orders which were placed had been cancelled and proper and efficient assistance was provided to the complainant against the cancelled orders. Considering the complainant’s grievance that her account was hacked, they immediately checked internally and assisted the complainant with sanitising/suppressing her account and ensuring all orders were cancelled to avoid any further issues.”“It is a general practice of online platforms that particularly a product before collection at the time of return is verified thoroughly by the collecting agent and the same is collected only after the same is found to be the same as the item delivered. In case of any difference, the product is never collected by the collecting agent. More so, this plea was never communicated at any stage to the complainant and seems an afterthought of Amazon Retail India,"" the commission said.It further noted that online platforms typically verify products thoroughly before collecting returns, but in this instance, Amazon failed to act promptly despite knowing about the suspicious activity.","A consumer court ruled in favour of a Chandigarh resident who faced financial losses due to fraudulent transactions on Amazon website.

""It is with a profound sense of loss that we bid farewell to Mr. Ratan Naval Tata, a truly uncommon leader whose immeasurable contributions have shaped not only the Tata Group but also the very fabric of our nation.

Mr. Tata's dedication to philanthropy and the development of society has touched the lives of millions.

“I think it’s a good idea to have

affordable cars

, but I think the problem is with something like the Nano … I wouldn’t say it’s a problem because I think, by the way, it is probably a great idea and Ratan is a gentleman and scholar.”

“But where it’s going to become challenging in the future is when the price of gasoline rises; the cost of acquiring the car is much less of an issue than the cost of running the car,”

A video of Tesla CEO Elon Musk praising Ratan Tata 's vision for the Tata Nano has resurfaced and gone viral following the Indian industrialist 's passing. The clip from 20029, shared by X user Nico Garcia, features Musk in conversation with TV presenter Charlie Rose , discussing Tata's ambitious goal of creating an affordable car for the masses.Musk expresses admiration for Tata's pursuit of the Rs 1 lakh car, acknowledging the challenges and complexities involved in bringing such a project to fruition.The video has resonated with many as India mourns the loss of Ratan Tata, who transformed the Tata Group into a global powerhouse.While discussing the future of cars, Rose asked Musk:Replying to that, Musk said:Musk added.The video has already received over 3.3 lakh views and thousands of likes.

How Hassabis reached this level

At this year’s Google I/O , company CEO Sundar Pichai welcomed “for the first time on stage”, Sir Demis Hassabis . While he might not have been a well-known name until Google Brain and AI startup DeepMind that the company acquired in 2014 were clubbed together, his work has spoken for him. The CEO and co-founder of Google DeepMind , the new AI unit at the Search giant, has been awarded the 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his pioneering work on AlphaFold , an artificial intelligence system that revolutionised protein structure prediction.Hassabis has been awarded the Nobel for AlphaFold – an AI system that is seen to have a transformative impact on the field of structural biology. Developed by Google DeepMind, it predicts the 3D structure of proteins from their amino acid sequence, a significant breakthrough in biology, as the 3D structure of a protein determines its function.Understanding protein structure is crucial for a wide range of applications, including drug discovery, disease understanding, and the development of new biomaterials. Since its public release in 2021, AlphaFold has predicted the structures of nearly all known proteins, creating a vast database of over 200 million protein structures.Demis Hassabis's journey to the Nobel Prize is a testament to the power of combining diverse passions Born in London in 1976, he first made waves as a chess prodigy, achieving master status at just 13. This early fascination with strategy and learning laid the groundwork for his future in AI.After graduating with top honours in computer science from Cambridge University, he even launched a video game company. He pursued a PhD in cognitive neuroscience, seeking to understand the intricacies of the human brain. This knowledge ultimately led him to co-found DeepMind, an AI startup that would revolutionise the field.His contributions were recognised with a knighthood in 2023, and now, the 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Throughout his career, Hassabis has emphasised the link between games and AI, seeing them as a gateway to understanding how machines learn.His early love for chess, particularly chess computers, sparked ideas that would later shape his pioneering work. DeepMind's AI systems, capable of beating humans in complex games like Go, chess, and Starcraft II, are a testament to his vision.",Sir Demis Hassabis is the CEO and co-founder of Google DeepMind.

Talk about AGI ‘premature’: LeCun

Yann LeCun , who is among the three ‘Godfathers’ of AI and is currently the chief AI scientist at Facebook parent company Meta , believes that many experts are overstating the power and dangers of artificial intelligence .In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, when asked about the fear of AI becoming a danger to humanity, he quips, “You're going to have to pardon my French, but that's complete B.S.”LeCun said that current AI models are nowhere near as intelligent as our pets, let alone humans – something that his fellow ‘godfathers of AI’ have warned about.He has publicly disagreed with Yoshua Bengio and Geoffrey Hinton over their warnings that AI is a danger to humanity.Bengio, a leading AI researcher himself, shares Yann LeCun's view that current AI models are far from truly intelligent. However, he's sceptical of companies' ability to prevent future advanced AI from being exploited for malicious purposes or developing harmful goals of its own.“I hope he is right, but I don’t think we should leave it to the competition between companies and the profit motive alone to protect the public and democracy. That is why I think we need governments involved,” Bengio was quoted as saying.He also criticises the tendency of some, particularly in the AI startup world, to overhype the current state of AI and make unrealistic predictions about its future.LeCun has also debunked the idea that AI will exceed human intelligence in the near future. LeCun said that talking about “artificial general intelligence,” or AGI, that broadly exceeds human-level intelligence, is likely premature.“It seems to me that before ‘urgently figuring out how to control AI systems much smarter than us’ we need to have the beginning of a hint of a design for a system smarter than a house cat,” he replied on X.While OpenAI ’s Sam Altman said AGI can be here within “a few thousand days”, Elon Musk has said it could happen by 2026. Though Meta’s AI chief thinks real artificial general intelligence is a worthy goal to achieve.“In the future, when people will talk to their AI system, to their smart glasses or whatever else, we need those AI systems to basically have human-level characteristics, and really have common sense, and really behave like a human assistant,” he says.But creating an AI this capable could easily take decades, he notes, adding that today’s AI setups aren’t going to reach artificial general intelligence.","Yann LeCun, the chief AI scientist at Facebook parent company Meta, believes that many experts are overstating the power and dangers of artificial intelligence.

How is the Virtual Queue system different from Spot booking

Why government has stopped Spot booking

Which are the parties opposing Virtual Queue system and why

Kerala government has announced the Virtual queue system for this year's Mandalam-Makaravilakku Sabarimala pilgrimage. The Devaswom minister VN Vasavan has made it clear that there will be no spot booking at Sabarimala, but assured that no devotee who comes to the Lord Ayyappa temple during the annual pilgrimage will miss out on 'darshan'. The Kerala government has also fixed the number of pilgrims per day at 80,000.The two-month-long annual pilgrimage season starts by mid-November.In the virtual queue system, pilgrims can book their darshan tickets and Prasadam online through the official website of the Sabarimala temple. The minister has said that measures such as colour-coded slots and real-time information on the preferred pilgrimage routes would be implemented for the Virtual Queue system. He further said that at the time of virtual queue booking, the pilgrims would get a chance to choose their travel route also.In spot booking, pilgrims can book slots for their darshan at designated centres identified by the Devaswom Board.The minister said that the decision to stop Spot bookings was crucial for the smooth conduct of the pilgrimage and ensuring the safety and convenience of devotees. The online system would provide a more organised and manageable flow of pilgrims, ensuring that the facilities at Sabarimala do not get overwhelmed.BJP state president K Surendran has threatened that the party leaders would go to the Lord Ayyappa temple without online booking and would stage protests if anybody blocked them. Questioning the government's decision, he said that the large number of devotees from various parts of Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh etc. could book online and visit the shrine.The opposition Congress-led UDF too has urged the government to retain spot booking along with the virtual queue booking. It is also not in favour of restricting the number of pilgrims to 80,000 per day. Congress leaders said that this would adversely affect pilgrims who come after completing the 41-day fasting period as they may be denied an opportunity to pray at the Temple.Even the CPI, the second largest coalition partner in the ruling LDF, has reportedly suggested to allow on-the-spot booking also along with Virtual queue booking.","Kerala government has announced the Virtual queue system for this year's Mandalam-Makaravilakku Sabarimala pilgrimage.

Explained: What is remote access scam and how you can protect yourself,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/explained-what-is-remote-access-scam-and-how-you-can-protect-yourself/articleshow/114187551.cms,"How do remote access scams work?

Phishing: Scammers often use phishing emails or calls to impersonate legitimate organisations like tech support or banks.

Creating a sense of urgency: They claim there's a problem with the victim's device or account, requiring immediate attention.

Requesting remote access: The scammer then asks the victim to grant them remote access to their device, often using a fake screen-sharing application.

Exploiting access: Once they have access, scammers can steal sensitive information, install malware, or lock the device, demanding a ransom.



How to protect yourself from remote access scams



Be cautious of unsolicited calls and emails: Never share personal information or grant remote access to anyone who contacts you unexpectedly.

Verify the sender: Before clicking on any links or replying to emails, double-check the sender's address and look for signs of phishing, such as poor grammar or unusual requests.

Never grant remote access to strangers: Legitimate organisations will never ask you to grant remote access to your device over the phone or email.

Use strong passwords: Create complex passwords for your online accounts and enable two-factor authentication whenever possible.

Keep your software updated: Ensure your operating system and software applications are up-to-date with the latest security patches.

Be wary of fake tech support : If you receive a call claiming to be from tech support, hang up and contact the company directly using a verified phone number or website.



Remote access scams are a type of cybercrime where scammers trick victims into granting them remote access to their devices. Once they have access, scammers can steal personal information, financial data, or install malware.By following these tips, you can significantly reduce your risk of falling victim to a remote access scam . If you believe you've been a victim, report it to the relevant authorities and your bank or service provider immediately.","Remote access scams are a type of cybercrime where scammers trick victims into granting them remote access to their devices.

Chinese surveillance camera maker Hikvision is reportedly downsizing its research and development (R&D) department. The company that faces US sanctions may be planning this move amidst geopolitical and economic pressures. Although the company denies any ""large-scale lay-offs,"" a report by Chinese online news platform Sina Tech (seen by the South China Morning Post) cited sources to suggest that over 1,000 employees in China could be affected by these job cuts .Hikvision has reportedly claimed that it is making internal adjustments necessary for ""optimising R&D power"" in its headquarters and key sales cities. Several Chinese media outlets also reported that the company has already adjusted “some regional job settings accordingly”. As per its annual report, the Shenzhen-listed company had 58,544 employees at the end of last year.While the company maintains it is not conducting mass layoffs, the term ""optimisation"" is often used in China to describe job cuts and avoid scrutiny. In China, significant layoffs are strictly regulated. If a company plans to lay off 20 or more employees or reduce its workforce by 10% or more, it must involve labour authorities in the process.This move reflects the challenges Hikvision faces as it navigates a complex global landscape, including US sanctions and a slowing Chinese economy. Hikvision and other Chinese video surveillance technology providers face significant restrictions in the US market due to allegations of human rights abuses.In 2019, the US added Hikvision and 27 other Chinese entities, including its competitor Dahua Technology, to the Entity List which bars them from purchasing components from US companies without government approval. This action stemmed from accusations of their complicity in the oppression of Uygur Muslims in China.Furthermore, in 2022, the US Federal Communications Commission imposed a ban on Hikvision and four other Chinese companies, including Huawei Technologies , prohibiting them from selling new equipment in the US due to perceived national security risks. Hikvision has strongly opposed these US government decisions.","Chinese surveillance camera maker Hikvision is reportedly downsizing its research and development (R&D) department.

How can users and businesses stay safe

Scammers are using Microsoft’s credibility to defraud people, a report has said. They commonly pose as employees or affiliated vendors of Microsoft – one of the most frequently impersonated brands – deceiving email recipients.Check Point Research has claimed that security researchers have caught over 5,000 emails masquerading as Microsoft notifications – suggesting that this trend is accelerating.It says that these fake emails utilise “exceptionally sophisticated obfuscation techniques”, making them “nearly impossible for users to distinguish them from legitimate communications”.According to the cybersecurity company, the fake Microsoft emails don’t originate from private or unknown domains, which is essentially a clue that the emails are potential threats. They found that the emails appear to come from organisational domains impersonating legitimate administrators.When it comes to the body of the emails, the most important part of the content “will typically include a fake login page or portal, where malicious content may be hidden”. An unsuspecting user can click on this and input sensitive information or download a threat.“To hide the malicious intent of these emails, cyber criminals are deploying sophisticated obfuscation techniques. Some emails include copied-and-pasted Microsoft privacy policy statements, contributing to an authentic ‘look and feel’,” it said.The emails may also have links to Microsoft or Bing pages, making it even more difficult for traditional security systems to recognise and mitigate these threats effectively.Now clicking on these links or inputting sensitive information on these fake pages may significantly impact businesses. The compromised emails may lead to email account takeover, ransomware, information theft or other negative outcomes.A bunch of measures can help individuals and businesses to sidestep these email-based threats. They include awareness training, AI-powered email security and quick software patching.","Scammers are using Microsoft’s credibility to defraud people, a report has said.

Proposals to hinder AI innovation in America

Splitting off Chrome or Android would break Google

Changes in ad business may uneven playing field

Proposed restrictions may create problems for consumers, businesses

The US Department of Justice ( DOJ ) recently outlined potential changes it may demand from Google as part of its ongoing antitrust lawsuit concerning the company's dominance in the search market. These proposed changes, which could significantly reshape how Google operates, came soon after a US judge said that the search giant has to open Android ’s Google Play Store to third-party developers.Google, maintaining that it will appeal against the decision, expressed concerns that the the Justice Department’s proposals extend far beyond the specific legal issues of the case. It outlined and explained five ways in which the ruling and proposals may potentially impact consumer privacy , hindering American innovation in artificial intelligence, and disrupting the online advertising ecosystem. Here are 5 things Google saidThe company says that DoJ's own outline acknowledges that forcing Google to share your searches with other companies poses significant privacy and security risks. Since searches are often highly personal, they are protected by Google's strong security measures and sharing this data with other companies, especially those with weaker security, could leave them vulnerable to bad actors who might try to identify you or exploit your search history.Google also argued that forcing Google to share its search results could stifle innovation by encouraging other companies to simply copy Google instead of developing their own search technologies.Google said that the DoJ's potential actions against Google's AI tools can hinder American innovation in this critical emerging field. The AI landscape is still evolving, with business models and key players yet to be firmly established.“There are enormous risks to the government putting its thumb on the scale of this vital industry — skewing investment, distorting incentives, hobbling emerging business models — all at precisely the moment that we need to encourage investment, new business models, and American technological leadership,” the company added.Google reiterated that it has invested billions in Chrome and Android – with both of them secure enough to protect user privacy and are offered for free. Breaking them off will change their business models, raise the cost of devices “and undermine Android and Google Play in their robust competition with Apple’s iPhone and App Store.”Google said since both of them are used by developers and device makers across different industries — from cars to fitness devices to TVs to laptops to apps and more — changes can impact many businesses and the people who use their services.Not only that, severing Chrome and Android would jeopardise security and make patching security bugs harder, the company arguedGoogle claims that changes to the online advertising market would make online ads less valuable for publishers and merchants, and less useful for consumers. The company notes that its innovative ads system has “levelled the playing field for small businesses and publishers”, allowing everyone to reach customers in the same way.“Government-mandated changes could disrupt this, and tilt the field at the precise moment that competition is thriving,” it added.The DOJ's proposed restrictions on how Google promotes its search engine could backfire, creating problems for both consumers and businesses, the company said.While on the consumer side, it will be harder for people to access Google Search, creating unnecessary obstacles for users who simply want to find information quickly and easily.While when it comes to business impact, the restrictions could also have unintended consequences for other companies like revenue sharing and potentially forcing them to raise phone prices for consumers.",The US Department of Justice recently outlined potential changes it may demand from Google as part of its ongoing antitrust lawsuit concerning the company's dominance in the search market.

How this attack affected users



Users in multiple cities face similar issues



What the company said



Multiple Ecovacs Deebot X2 robot vacuums in US cities were recently hacked. This allowed attackers to remotely control the devices and broadcast racial slurs through their built-in speakers. This incident follows a report by the ABC, which demonstrated a critical security flaw in the Chinese-made robot vacuum model. The hackers exploited this vulnerability to gain unauthorised access to the Deebot X2s, enabling them to manipulate the vacuums' movements and utilise the speakers for malicious purposes.""It sounded like a broken-up radio signal or something. You could hear snippets of maybe a voice,” Minnesota lawyer Daniel Swenson said to ABC News. He said was watching TV when his robot vacuum started to malfunction.After resetting the device, the vacuum began moving on its own and broadcasting racist slurs through its speaker, exposing the family to hateful content. This incident highlights the serious privacy and security risks associated with smart home devices .""I got the impression it was a kid, maybe a teenager [speaking]. Maybe they were just jumping from device to device messing with families,” Swenson said.He also added that it could have been much worse as the attackers could’ve decided to quietly observe his family inside their home. The hackers could have easily spied on the family through the compromised robot vacuum, accessing its camera and microphone without their knowledge or consent. Finally, the device was taken to the garage and wasn’t switched on again.Multiple Ecovacs Deebot X2 robot vacuums in the US were reportedly hacked within days of each other. The attackers remotely controlled the vacuums, harassed pets, and yelled racist slurs through the speakers. These incidents follow an ABC News report that revealed security flaws in the Deebot X2, including a faulty PIN code system and the ability to disable the camera warning sound. Hackers could potentially access the camera and microphone without the owner's knowledge.Despite multiple reports of similar incidents, Ecovacs initially appeared dismissive of Daniel Swenson's complaint about his hacked robot vacuum. The company later conducted a ""security investigation"" and claimed that Swenson's account was likely compromised through a "" credential stuffing "" attack, where login credentials reused across multiple websites are stolen from a different platform. Ecovacs maintains that there is no evidence of a breach within their systems.","Multiple Ecovacs Deebot X2 robot vacuums in the US were reportedly hacked within days of each other.

When Ratan Tata made this request to SEBI chief for TCS' first CEO FC Kohli during TCS IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/when-ratan-tata-made-this-request-to-sebi-chief-for-tcs-first-ceo-fc-kohli-during-tcs-ipo/articleshow/114173196.cms,"Sanghai on Ratan Tata's special request for TCS CEO to SEBI chief

July 2004, with torrential Bombay monsoon lashing outside, Mr. Ratan Tata got off the podium at the Ball room of Taj Mahal Hotel, Colaba. He had just announced the launch of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) Initial Public Offering (IPO), the most high-profile IPO of Indian capital markets then. There were quite a few capital market players and media people still waiting to interact with him. In this chaos he expressed his keenness to go meet the then SEBI Chairman, Mr. G N Bajpai. Almost at no notice, I, a young investment banker then, was handed the task of setting up this meeting at SEBI’s Nariman Point office.

I was clueless as to why Mr. Tata would want to rush to meet the SEBI chairman, and that too in such wet weather conditions. He had barely completed a very successful launch conference and there were people still wanting to meet him. But when we arrived at the SEBI headquarters, I was pleasantly surprised with the agenda of the meeting.

Mr. Tata started the meeting by saying, he requested for a short notice meeting for two reasons. First, he wanted to thank SEBI for their support through the IPO process. Second, and equally importantly, in his persuasive deep voice he said that Mr. F C Kohli, first CEO of TCS, had been instrumental in building an institution like TCS for the Tata Group. Mr. Tata therefore expressed his desire to allot one share to Mr.

F C Kohli

as a symbolic gesture in recognition of his contribution.

In another gesture of his humility, the bankers who accompanied Mr. Tata for the TCS IPO roadshow were very pleasantly surprised to receive a handwritten personal letter of appreciation from him. These small acts and values in totality are what made Mr. Tata the Redwood tree of the Indian corporate world – the tallest figure that leaves a mark that stays with you always.

Ratan Naval Tata passed away earlier this week at a hospital in Mumbai. Tata Group's chairman emeritus was India Inc's most-loved and respected leader. As several industry doyens said in their tribute to Ratan Tata , what he said was regarded as universal truth. Ratan Tata’s demise marks the end of an extraordinary corporate journey, one that not only made Tata Group a global giant but also set new benchmarks for Indian industry on the world map.Under his visionary leadership, Tata Group's revenue surged from $4 billion in 1991 to over $100 billion by 2012, when he retired, making it the first Indian business group to achieve this feat. One major milestone in this was the IPO of the group's software company -- Tata Consultancy Services -- in the year 2004. TCS made history with the first $1 billion initial public offering (IPO) by a private-sector company in India. TCS is Tata Group's most valuable and India's second-largest company in market cap.Ratan Tata led TCS' public listing. He even took part in some roadshows done for the TCS IPO. Writing for Economic Times, Sunil Sanghai, founder and CEO of NovaaOne Capital, shared an incident from the TCS IPO that showed how, as he wrote, ""the tallest member of the Indian industry (Ratan Tata) remembered every contribution and it was very important for him to recognise them.""",Ratan Naval Tata passed away earlier this week at a hospital in Mumbai.

Apple researchers conduct study on AI’s reasoning ability in mathematics: What they found,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-researchers-conduct-study-on-ais-reasoning-ability-in-mathematics-what-they-found/articleshow/114173142.cms,"Why Apple researchers conducted a study

What are the results of the study

LLMs ‘fall short of true logical reasoning’

Apple researchers , questioning the formal reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), particularly in mathematics, conducted a study to understand the reliability of the reported metrics. They found that LLMs exhibit noticeable variance when responding to different instantiations of the same question.Researchers were concerned whether LLMs mathematical reasoning capabilities have genuinely advanced, raising questions about the reliability of the reported metrics.To address these concerns, the researchers conducted a large-scale study on several state-of-the-art open and closed models.According to the results of the research, Apple researchers found that the reasoning process in LLMs is probabilistic pattern-matching rather than formal reasoning.“Our findings reveal that LLMs exhibit noticeable variance when responding to different instantiations of the same question,” the researchers wrote in their paper titled “GSM-Symbolic: Understanding the Limitations of Mathematical Reasoning in Large Language Models.”“Specifically, the performance of all models declines when only the numerical values in the question are altered in the GSM-Symbolic benchmark ,” they added.The ‘GSM8K’ benchmark is widely used to assess the mathematical reasoning of models on grade-school level questions.Although LLMs can match more abstract reasoning patterns, they fall short of true logical reasoning, the paper stated.“Additionally, in tasks requiring the correct selection of multiple tokens, the probability of arriving at an accurate answer decreases exponentially with the number of tokens or steps involved, underscoring their inherent unreliability in complex reasoning scenarios,” said Apple researchers.“Furthermore, we investigate the fragility of mathematical reasoning in these models and demonstrate that their performance significantly deteriorates as the number of clauses in a question increases. We hypothesise that this decline is due to the fact that current LLMs are not capable of genuine logical reasoning; instead, they attempt to replicate the reasoning steps observed in their training data,” they added.",Researchers were concerned whether LLMs mathematical reasoning capabilities have genuinely advanced.
