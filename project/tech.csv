Apple may bring AI to Vision Pro

Apple is reportedly exploring new suppliers for OLED-on-silicon panels for a more affordable version of Vision Pro . The company has issued a request for information (RFI) to LG Display and Samsung Display, reports The Elec.Apple’s current headset- Vision Pro uses Sony’s OLEDoS panels. It features a 1.42-inch display with a pixel density of almost 3,400 PPI.The Cupertino-based company currently purchases high-resolution displays from Sony. However, it has a limited production capacity of up to 900,000 panels per year. In the RFI request to LG and Samsung, the company seeks to evaluate their capabilities in producing larger OLEDoS panels, ranging from 2.0 to 2.1 inches in size with a display density of about 1,700 pixels per inch (PPI). “Since the Oledos pixel density mentioned in the RFI is low, it is presumed to be aimed at entry-level models,” reads the report. It is likely that the display mayAccording to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, Apple is also planning to bring artificial intelligence (AI) to the Vision Pro headset. Apple Intelligence, introduced last month, includes a host of new features like improved Siri, proofreading tools, custom emojis, among others. Gurman states that Apple Intelligence will not be launching on the Vision Pro this year, Gurman says. Apple’s main challenge here is rethinking how the features will look like in mixed reality.In a related news, Apple's AirPods are set to receive a significant upgrade with the integration of cameras, according to a report by MacRumors. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicts Apple will begin mass production of these AirPods with built-in infrared (IR) cameras by 2026.The primary function of these IR cameras is to work in conjunction with Apple's Vision Pro headset, enhancing the spatial computing and audio experience. Kuo adds that Apple may star the mass production for the new AirPods with integrated IR camera modules next year. The report also adds that the IR cameras on the AirPods will be similar to the iPhone’s Face ID receiver.","Apple is reportedly exploring new suppliers for OLED-on-silicon panels for a more affordable version of Vision Pro.

What tech and industry leaders have to say

Google Search has been the most prominent source of information and with the advent of AI, ChatGPT is another go-to place to get the work done. We quickly get answers to our queries but they come at a price, especially when it comes to AI, a report said.According to a recent report in The Economic Times, a single year of using ChatGPT could consume enough energy to power New Zealand for three months and Nigeria for 4 months.This figure is estimated at 10 terawatt-hours (TWh), and highlights the environmental impact of AI.A single ChatGPT query is said to utilise 2.9 watt-hours, nearly 10 times more than a Google search (0.3 watt-hours). With AI's computational needs rising every 100 days, the energy required for AI tasks is growing exponentially at rates between 26-36%.By 2028, the computing power needed to power AI is projected to match Iceland's entire 2021 energy consumption, the report said. The International Energy Agency predicts the AI industry's energy consumption will skyrocket tenfold by 2026.AI technology is also consuming another resource: Water. The report says that data centres – the lifeblood of AI – guzzle water for cooling. Microsoft, for instance, saw a 34% increase in energy consumption in just one year. In the same timeframe, it consumed 6.4 million cubic metres of water, up from 4.7 million cubic metres.Just running a few basic AI queries can consume half a litre of water. As AI models become more complex, water usage is expected to climb even higher. By 2027, global AI demand could withdraw a staggering 4.2 to 6.6 billion cubic metres of freshwater – nearly half the amount consumed by the entire UK.ChatGPT-maker OpenAI's Sam Altman emphasises the need for energy breakthroughs, suggesting solar power and nuclear fusion as potential solutions. Meanwhile, Elon Musk has warned of an impending energy crisis due to AI's hunger for power, calling for either a pause in development or a shift towards sustainable energy sources.Microsoft, however, sees AI as part of the climate solution. Company chairman and CEO Satya Nadella highlighted AI for Good initiatives in Egypt and Kenya, aiming to leverage AI for environmental resilience.","A single ChatGPT query is said to utilise 2.9 watt-hours, nearly 10 times more than a Google search.

Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman has said that the company competes ‘ferociously’ with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI , the company in which the Windows-maker invested upwards of $13 billion. Suleyman also said that he dearly loves Sam Altman and trusts him on AI safety.He noted that Microsoft’s AI plans are not so closely dependent on OpenAI.“It is true that we have ferocious competition with them,” Suleyman said about OpenAI in an interview with CNBC’s Andrew Ross Sorkin at the Aspen Ideas Festival.“They are an independent company. We don’t own or control them. We don’t even have any board members. So they do entirely their own thing. But we have a deep partnership. I’m very good friends with Sam, have huge respect and, trust and faith in what they’ve done.

Suleyman also described all of this fingerpointing by the former employees as a “healthy dialogue.”“I think it’s a great thing that technologists and entrepreneurs and CEOs of companies like myself and Sam, who I love dearly and think is awesome are talking about regulation,” he said.“He is not cynical, he is sincere. He believes it genuinely,” Suleyman said about Altman.“Friction is going to be our friend here. These technologies are becoming so powerful, they will be so intimate, they’ll be so ever-present, that this is a moment where it’s fine to take stock,” he added.Suleyman also noted that if all of this dialogue slows down AI development by six to 18 months or longer “it’s time well spent.”",Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman has said that the company competes ‘ferociously’ with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI.

Melinda stepped from Gates foundation after the divorce

Bill Gates divorced Melinda French Gates in 2021. Years later, Melinda French Gates has opened up about her divorce with the Microsoft co-founder. In an interview with Time Magazine recently, she described the end of 27-years marriage as ‘a painful and horrible experience’.“Getting a divorce is a horrible thing. It’s just painful. It’s awful when you realize you need one,” she said.Although later she corrected 'horrible' to 'hard', but added that things are wonderful now that it’s over.In the interview, Melinda French Gates also talked about how getting divorced in a pandemic helped the couple get privacy. “It gave us the privacy to do what needed to be done in private,"" she told the publication.She also reflected on being able to navigate the process while taking care of children. “You know, I separated first before I made the full decision about a divorce. And to be able to do that in private while I’m still trying to take care of the kids, while still making certain decisions about how you’re going to disentangle your life - thank God,"" she said.The divorce led her to step away from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in May this year, three years after the divorce. During the interview, she told Time that she thought about the effect of divorce on the foundation.""I thought a lot about my three children. But I certainly thought about the effect on the foundation. Those are the three biggest buckets: me, the kids, and the foundation. And I wanted to make sure that when we came through it to the other side - all of those pieces were intact.”Melinda also explained that she does not see her decision to exit the foundation as ‘downsizing’. “I don’t see it honestly as a downsizing ...I was just ready to be able to have full decision-making control about where all the funds go,” she said.","Melinda French Gates has opened up about her divorce with the Microsoft co- founder.

Apple has announced Apple Intelligence , a suite of AI features that will run on iPhones, iPads and Mac PCs. The AI features will be available later this year to users globally, including China – one the most critical markets for the company. However, the company’s big AI push may face some challenges in China as regulators have in place strict rules around the technology amid tough competition.The three challenges that the company may face in China are (via CNBC):China’s AI market is tightly regulated and all companies launching AI models must have approval from the regulators for the commercial use of LLMs.The country has also made it mandatory for Generative AI providers to take down “illegal” content.Since some of the features of Apple Intelligence are developed by the company itself, Apple will likely need to get its AI model approved by authorities under Chinese rules.China has also banned OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Some of Apple’s voice assistant Siri’s capabilities are dependent on ChatGPT. This could mean that Apple may have to find a local AI company that provides the same level of capabilities as ChatGPT. Baidu and Alibaba are among China’s technology giants that have their own LLMs and voice assistants.Apple's AI launch highlighted a focus on user privacy. Their new system, Private Cloud Compute, processes user data on Apple-owned servers, with the company claiming the data itself is not stored.However, in China, Apple's iCloud data is stored on servers located locally and operated by a third party. This may raise concerns about whether Apple can maintain complete control over its AI computing servers in the country.This means that Apple must have a similar partnership for its AI servers in the region to keep user data private.","Apple has announced Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI features that will run on iPhones, iPads and Mac PCs.

What is UPI Lite and why banks are pushing it

How to register for email to receive all the UPI transaction alerts



https://instaservices.hdfcbank.com/?journey=107&source_type=103

Starting June 25, HDFC Bank will stop sending text alerts for low-value UPI transactions. This means that HDFC Bank customers will receive SMS alerts for UPI transactions exceeding Rs 100 when sending money and similar notification for when received is above Rs 500. However, the bank will continue to send email alerts for all transactions with no absolutely change.In a mail as well as SMS alert sent to its customers, HDFC Bank said: “Starting from 25th June, 2024: Email Alerts: Continue to receive email alerts for all UPI transactions.SMS Notifications: Now only for transactions above Rs 100 (money sent/paid) and Rs 500 (money received).”This change aligns with banking norms, which require text messages for transactions over Rs 5,000. Despite this, many banks send alerts for lower-value debits as well. HDFC Bank stated that feedback indicated alerts for low-value transactions were deemed 'not useful,' as there is often duplication of notifications from UPI payment apps.Bankers noted that bulk text messages cost between Rs 0.01-0.03 each. With UPI transactions averaging around 40 crores per day, banks collectively spend several crores daily on text message alerts.Banks are also promoting the use of UPI Lite for transactions up to Rs 500. UPI Lite allows a small amount of money to be set aside by the app, facilitating quick payments without the need for second-factor authentication.By reducing the frequency of low-value transaction alerts, HDFC Bank and others aim to streamline notifications for customers while also cutting costs. This shift is expected to enhance the user experience and encourage the adoption of UPI Lite for smaller transactions.

Apple is expected to launch its next-gen iPhone 16 series models in September. However, rumours and speculations related to the upcoming iPhones are already making the rounds on the internet. Now, a new leak suggests that the iPhone 16 may get a major design overhaul.In a post shared on the social media platform X (earlier Twitter), a tipster named Ice Universe shared a video showing the alleged case of the upcoming iPhone 16.The leaked case reveals that the upcoming iPhone 16 may have a vertical rear camera setup, similar to the one that was last seen on iPhone 12.The new case design also reveals a new cutout at the right side of the phone which may house a dedicated camera shutter button for the iPhone 16 Pro models.The dedicated shutter button which is expected to come powered by the company’s haptic engine is rumoured to join the existing physical buttons. This button may use a soft tap for focus and a double tap/hard press for capture, offering an improved camera experience.This alignment will reportedly enable spatial video recording capabilities similar to iPhone 15 Pro which has two cameras stacked vertically while the third camera is arranged diagonally.However, the latest rumours contradict earlier reports that suggested that the iPhone 16 may arrive with a buttonless design.The leaked case also suggests that Apple may be adding more buttons alongside the volume and power controls. The customisable ""Action"" button, which was introduced in iPhone 15 Pro, may also make a return in iPhone 16. This button also has the potential to replace the mute switch and offer users programmable functionalities. If these rumours are to be true, it would significantly alter the look and feel of the iPhone 16 lineup.","A new leak suggests that the iPhone 16 may get a major design overhaul.
