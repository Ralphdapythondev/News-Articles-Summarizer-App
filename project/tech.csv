Why Apple Mac users must update their ChatGPT desktop app right now,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-apple-mac-users-must-update-their-chatgpt-desktop-app-right-now/articleshow/111468415.cms,"What’ the ChatGPT macOS bug all about

How to keep yourself safe

OpenAI launched its ChatGPT desktop app for Mac last month, offering features like text generation and code writing through chatbot interaction. Now, a recent report has raised security concerns , suggesting a flaw in the app could have exposed users' conversations with the chatbot to hackers or malicious apps. OpenAI has fixed the ChatGPT app bug.“We are aware of this issue and have shipped a new version of the application which encrypts these conversations.We’re committed to providing a helpful user experience while maintaining our high security standards as our technology evolves,” OpenAI spokesperson Taya Christianson told The Verge .Developer Pedro Vieito spotted the bug and said that all the conversations that a user has had with the chatbot was being stored on the computer in plain text. This means that if a hacker or a malicious app had access to the computer, they could have easily read those conversations.This was dangerous because the app may have 'skipped' the “sandboxing” security control system that Apple has in its products. Sandboxing is a security feature that isolates apps and their data, preventing them from accessing other data of the system or from other apps without permission. This essentially protects user data from unauthorised access by other apps or malware.Unlike iPhones where all apps are sandboxed,macOS adopted the system where apps are required to explicitly ask for permission to access data outside their sandbox. Notably, most chat apps that handle sensitive data typically utilise sandboxing for an extra layer of security and apparently, the ChatGPT app wasn’t sandboxed.The first advice is to only download apps from the official app store because they undergo scrutiny before being made available for users. In case of chatbots, do not share sensitive data while having a conversation because the data may be used to train the AI models.","OpenAI launched its ChatGPT desktop app for Mac last month.

Apple MacBook Pro models with M4 chipsets: What to expect



Apple is expected to launch new MacBook Pro and MacBook Air models in the coming months. According to a report by Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, the rumoured MacBook Pro and MacBook Air machines are likely to come powered by three variants of Apple’s M4 chipsets -- the base M4, M4 Pro and M4 Max chipsets. The report also notes that the upgraded MacBooks may retain their predecessor's designs and may even offer new features through an AI subscription service which is expected to boost sales.Rumours suggest that Apple will soon release 14-inch and 16-inch models of MacBook Pros with M4 chips by the end of this year or early next year. Moreover, MacBook Air sizes are also in line for an early 2025 refresh.Currently, the only Apple devices with the M4 chip are the newest iPad Pro models . The most affordable option is the 11-inch iPad Pro with 256GB of storage which was launched at Rs 99,900.Gurman claims that both the MacBook Pro and MacBook Air won't see any design changes despite getting upgraded to the M4 chipsets. This comes after the 2021 redesign of the MacBook Pro with the M1 chip.He also suggested that a more significant visual overhaul might be coming in 2026, potentially coinciding with the adoption of OLED displays similar to the latest iPad Pro models.Similarly, the MacBook Air is also expected to wait until 2027 for a design refresh, five years after it departs from the wedge shape.Gurman acknowledges that a chip upgrade alone might not be enough to entice existing MacBook users to upgrade.To address this, Apple is reportedly considering a monthly subscription service that builds upon the free Apple Intelligence launching this fall.Additionally, Gurman claims Apple might integrate and potentially take a commission on third-party AI services like ChatGPT, mirroring their App Store model.",Apple is expected to launch new MacBook Pro and MacBook Air models in the coming months.

Credit card fraud involves cybercriminals obtaining sensitive credit card information such as the card number, PIN, CVV, and other necessary details to make unauthorised purchases or transfers.While credit card fraud detection systems can aid in identifying fraudulent transactions to some extent, fraudsters often manage to inflict substantial financial harm on victims before being apprehended.Therefore, it's crucial to familiarise oneself with various types of credit card fraud and take proactive measures to avoid becoming a victim. Being vigilant and informed can significantly reduce the risk of falling prey to such fraudulent activities.Despite the low or zero liabilities for credit card users, fraud or identity theft can still cause significant inconvenience for both customers and banks. While the bank's zero-liability policy protects credit card users from financial losses if they report the fraud within 60 days, they must endure the process of detecting the theft, notifying the bank, obtaining a replacement card, paying any associated fees, and updating all automatic payment accounts.The rise of awareness among credit card users is essential for early detection and prevention of fraud, helping banks address potential issues proactively.",The rise of awareness among credit card users is essential for early detection and prevention of fraud.

Apple iPhone 16 series rumours

Apple iPhone 16 series is expected to launch in September and in the run up to the debut, the rumour mill is already churning out scores of leaks. According to another such leak, iPhone 16 Pro Max is expected to get a boost in battery life .Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has said that the Cupertino-based giant is increasing the energy density of the battery cells of iPhone 16 Pro Max, which will result in longer battery life.“My latest supply chain survey indicates the energy density (Wh/kg) of the battery cells of iPhone 16 Pro Max will increase, which has the benefit of longer battery life with the same battery size or lower battery size with the same battery life,” he said in a post.However, with increase in energy density of the battery cells, there will be an increase in temperature when running. To tackle this, Apple will use the stainless steel battery case .“Increasing the energy density of the battery cells will increase the battery temperature when running. To avoid overheating the battery, Apple uses the stainless steel battery case for the first time as a thermal solution ,” Kuo said.While stainless steel may not be as effective as aluminium in dissipating heat, “it is more robust and less susceptible to corrosion, so in addition to dissipating heat, the stainless steel battery case provides better protection for the battery and the iPhone system.”Kuo noted that the use of a stainless steel battery case will reduce the difficulty of removing the battery, hence, helping Apple to “comply with the European Union’s requirements for mobile phone batteries’ replaceability in the future.”“If the mass production of this new battery design (upgraded energy density of battery cells & adoption of the stainless steel battery case) goes well and the feedback is favourable, this new battery design will be adopted in all 2H25 new iPhone models,” Kuo noted.The iPhone 16 series is rumoured to replace physical buttons with touch-sensitive buttons that simulate a press with haptic feedback. The camera layout might shift to a vertical design, unlike the current diagonal setup. The customisable Action button, currently on Pro models, might be available on all iPhone 16 models.Under the hood, the standard iPhone 16 and Plus models might use the A18 chip , while Pro models could get the A18 Pro chip. Meanwhile, the display size for iPhone 16 and Plus (6.1-inch and 6.7-inch) might remain the same, but the refresh rate could improve.","iPhone 16 Pro Max is expected to get a boost in battery life.
