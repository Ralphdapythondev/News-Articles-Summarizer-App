How Apple will restructure App Store

Read the full letter here

I have some professional news to share and sent out this message to Apple colleagues earlier this afternoon:

Dear Friends and Colleagues,

After 21 years at Apple, I’ve made the decision to step away from our incredible company. This has been on my mind for some time, and as we are also reorganizing the team to better manage new challenges and opportunities, now is the right moment to pass the baton to two outstanding leaders on my team — Carson Oliver and Ann Thai — both of whom are more than ready for this next chapter.

When I joined Apple in 2003, we were launching the iTunes Music Store. I started as a contractor, helping to sign indie labels to iTunes, and was soon brought on full-time as one of the first members of the marketing team. Together, we built the iTunes brand, grew our customer base, expanded internationally, and formed partnerships that propelled our growth. I loved working closely with artists, record labels, TV networks, film studios, and emerging podcasters, helping them thrive on our platform.

In 2007, everything changed with the introduction of the iPhone. I was in the audience at Macworld that day, and the energy in that room when Steve unveiled the product was unlike anything I’d ever experienced in my career. The App Store followed a year later in 2008, with 500 apps. Apple’s goals were clear and remain true today: to create a safe and trusted place for customers to discover and download apps, while offering developers a great business opportunity. Since then, we’ve expanded the App Store to iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, Apple TV and Apple Vision Pro, and we launched Apple Arcade. Running the global App Store business over the past 15 years and working with our amazing team and Apple developer community has been the highlight of my career.

Throughout my two decades at Apple, I’ve been fortunate to work with some truly inspiring leaders, including Steve Jobs, Tim Cook, Eddy Cue, and Phil Schiller. I’m deeply grateful for the wisdom, support, and guidance they’ve provided me. I also want to thank my incredible colleagues for their commitment to our customers, to our developers, and to each other. I’m immensely proud of what we’ve built together — a platform with over 1 billion customers worldwide, with developers generating over $1 trillion in total billings and sales in the App Store ecosystem in 2022 alone.

Going forward, Carson and Ann will be leading the team, and I’ll be available through mid-October to assist with the transition. After that, I plan to take some time off, creating memories with my wife Renee and our two teenage sons, before exploring new opportunities. Please stay in touch — you can always reach me at matt.fischer@me.com.

From the bottom of my heart, thank you for your support, inspiration, and friendship. It’s been an honor and a privilege to work with all of you.

Best,

Matt

Apple’s App Store vice president is leaving the company in October. The Cupertino-based tech giant is set to reorganise in response to the changes in global regulations. Fischer announced his departure from the company in a LinkedIn post. However, Apple has yet to share any official statement regarding the sameIn the LinkedIn post, Fischer wrote: ""After 21 years at Apple, I’ve made the decision to step away from our incredible company.This has been on my mind for some time, and as we are also reorganising the team to better manage new challenges and opportunities, now is the right moment to pass the baton to two outstanding leaders on my team.”As per his LinkedIn profile, Fischer holds the title of “Vice President, Head of Worldwide App Store and Apple Arcade."" He joined Apple in 2003 and led marketing and partnerships for iTunes before shifting to the App Store in 2010.

Details of the fake lottery scam

Kerala Police has reportedly sent a notice to Google, Meta over apps and ads that are linked to fake lotteries. According to the news agency PTI, the state police has asked Google to remove 60 fake lottery apps from its Google Play Store. A similar notice has been sent to Meta to remove advertisements of such fake lotteries from social media platforms Facebook, Whatsapp and Instagram managed by it.In a press release, the State Police Media Centre (SPMC) said that fake advertisements in the name of 'Kerala Megamillion Lottery' and 'Kerala Summer Season Dhamaka' have been circulating on social media platforms like WhatsApp, Telegram and Instagram for some time stating that lotteries run by the state government can be bought online.After a cyber patrolling, the police discovered 60 apps, 25 fake Facebook profiles and 20 websites that are connected to the scam, the SPMC release said.The police said that people also get messages on their phones stating that the Kerala government has started an online lottery and on spending Rs 40 rupees there is a chance to win up to Rs 12 crore. Victims who send Rs 40 on the number mentioned in the message get a fake lottery ticket image via WhatsApp.The fraudsters then send artificially fabricated results to make the victim believe that the ticket has won a prize of Rs 5 lakh. From here, a scammer posing as a government representative calls the 'ticket holder' and asks them to transfer a certain amount to a bank account towards 'GST' and 'stamp duty' to receive the prize money.""Victims are provided with artificially produced documents and videos to make every step seem believable,"" the SPMC release said. The fraudsters demand more money claiming that the RBI is holding on to the prize, forcing the victim to pay.The police have urged the public to be careful not to fall prey to such online lottery scam s and to immediately call on the number 1930 if they suspect that a financial fraud is taking place.","Kerala Police has reportedly sent a notice to Google, Meta over apps and ads that are linked to fake lotteries.

Official reveals reason behind slow internet in Pakistan and its ‘not a firewall’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/official-reveals-reason-behind-slow-internet-in-pakistan-and-its-not-a-firewall/articleshow/112691571.cms,"Internet problems in Pakistan

Pakistan telecom watchdog chief has revealed the reason for patchy internet in the country. Hafeezur Rehman, the chairman of the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) has said that a faulty submarine cable caused the nationwide internet slowdown .“The internet slowdown in the country is due to a faulty submarine cable, which is expected to be repaired by August 28,” Rehman said, as per news agency PTI.He also dismissed claims that government-installed firewalls were responsible for the glitch.Both the opposition and the business community had previously accused the government of using a “firewall” to monitor internet traffic and deliberately slow down services. The government has denied these allegations, attributing the slowdown to a necessary upgrade of its web management system.“In my opinion, the Internet should not slow down due to an upgrade,” he said, adding that the telecom sector has suffered a loss of Rs 300 million due to internet disruptions.For weeks, there have been allegations that the government was deliberately slowing internet speeds to censor criticism, particularly from the opposition Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party.Internet users claim that they have been facing difficulties in sending or downloading media and voice notes through WhatsApp when connected to mobile data.Rehman also addressed concerns about the prolonged ban on the social media platform X, stating that he had no further information on the matter. He clarified that VPNs were not being blocked in Pakistan.Earlier, the business community and the internet service providers (ISPs) also had alleged that the government's efforts to monitor internet traffic through a 'firewall' were responsible for the slowdown of digital services, causing economic losses, as per PTI.",Pakistan's telecom watchdog chief reveals reason for internet slowdown.

Ministry of Home Affairs has a warning on this 'porn letter' going viral,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ministry-of-home-affairs-has-a-warning-on-this-porn-letter-going-viral/articleshow/112691342.cms,"Times of India gets viral ‘porn letter'

What users can do upon receiving such letter

Cyber Dost , the cyber-safety and cybersecurity awareness handle maintained by the home ministry has warned about a fake letter circulating on social media, claiming to be from the Indian Cybercrime Coordination Centre (I4C) CEO Rajesh Kumar. The fraudulent letter accuses the recipient of engaging in child pornography and pedophilia, among others.“In a letter purportedly issued by Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Center (I4C), several allegations are being levelled at the recipient & a reply is being sought to the letter,” Cyber Dost said in a post it reshared on Wednesday (August 21).“This letter is #fake. No such letter has been issued by any organisation under GOI #I4C #MHA,” the post added.Recently, The Times of India also received a similar letter. The content on the ‘fake’ letter is similar to the photo that Cyber Dost has shared but the signatories are different. Moreover, the letter seems to have two mastheads – one from the Ministry of Home Affairs and other from “The Indian Police Service, Office of the Additional Director General of Police (ADG)”.The accompanying email said, “By the mandate of Sh. Sandeep Khirwar the Additional Director General, ADG Headquarter and the Cyber Crime & Economic Offense Department has conducted an analysis of your internet protocol. This analysis revealed that you have been secretly accessing juvenile pornographic websites through your office or home internet.”“The Ministry of Home Affairs works closely with the Special Cell of Delhi Police and is a specialised unit that handles all complex and sensitive cases of cybercrime including those in which victims are women and children,” it added.The email added that the department’s advanced digital forensics labs can detect any access to child porn websites and that it has the tools to recover deleted data and analyse various devices. It also threatened legal action in case the notice is not responded to in 24 hours fo receipt.Scammers are using advanced techniques to trick people, hence it is advised that users must stay calm and don't panic.

According to a report in Economic Times, the telecom companies argue that they cannot afford the additional 5% cost amid ongoing 4G and 5G network expansions .Operators reason that they are yet to monetise their 5G businesses and even the full impact of the recent headline tariff hikes of 11-25% will reach them only by the December quarter of FY25.With 5G services still in their nascent stages and the full impact of recent tariff hikes yet to materialize, the operators contend that absorbing higher import duties would significantly erode the benefits of increased revenues and further hinder 5G monetization efforts. ""There is pressure on network vendors to absorb the increased BCD on imported PCBAs as the telcos say they have just initiated tariff repair, and the higher import duty, if passed on to the telco clients, would sharply reduce the benefit of the recent tariff hikes and increase 5G business monetisation challenges,"" a senior executive of a leading 5G gear maker told ET.The situation is particularly challenging for VodafoneIdea, which is grappling with a substantial debt burden and the need to expand its 4G network before rolling out 5G services.This pressure on vendors comes as Jio and Airtel are in advanced talks to procure around $2 billion worth of network equipment for the second phase of their 5G deployments.The government’s decision to increase the BCD on PCBAs to 15% has added to the financial strain on the telecom industry. This critical component is essential for manufacturing telecom equipment.","Bharti Airtel, Reliance Jio, and Vodafone Idea (Vi) are reportedly pressing global equipment providers Nokia, Ericsson, and Samsung to absorb the recent increase in basic customs duty (BCD) on printed circuit board assemblies ( PCBAs) The telecom companies argue that they cannot afford the additional 5% cost amid ongoing 4G and 5G network expansions.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112691494,imgsize-793091,width-400,resizemode-4/112691494.jpg"

Tensor G4, Gemini and more AI inside

Upgraded cameras with the new 'Add me' AI feature for photos

Google has launched its second-generation Pixel foldable phone, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold , which is its first-ever foldable phone in India. The second-gen Pixel Fold upgrades on some salient aspects over the first one. Per Google, the foldable is slim, super durable, and has a brighter screen, both on the outside and inside. And, the phone also packs in Pixel’s “fastest, most powerful” Tensor G4 chip , bringing on-device multimodal capabilities to the phone.On the inside, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold comes equipped with an 8 inches ‘Super Actua Flex display,’ an LTPO panel with a 2922x1344 resolution at 486 PPI. The inner screen has a dynamic refresh rate of 1-120Hz and can go as bright as 3,000 nits, which Google says is 80% brighter than the screen on the first-gen Pixel Fold. To make use of phone’s large inner canvas, there’s a split-screen mode that’ll let you use two apps side-by-side.When unfolded, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold can be used a regular phone with a 6.3 inches outer screen, which has the same specs as the inner screen.Google says that the Pixel 9 Pro Fold has an “all-new” hinge that is made from stainless steel and has an aerospace grade aluminium alloy cover. The hinge has a polished finish, while the back has the silky matt finish. The phone is rated IPX8 for water resistivity. And there’s Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the outside.Powering the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is Google’s Tensor G4 chip, also found on the other three Pixel 9 phones. The chip comes paired with 16GB of RAM and up to 1TB storage. Then, there’s theTitan M2 security coprocessor , which enables multi-layer hardware security.There’s a 5,060mAh battery, which Google promises will last for over 24 hours and up to 100 hours with Extreme Battery Saver. The phone supports fast charging at 45W, which should fill up the battery up to 55% in about 30 minutes. FYI, the charger isn’t included in the box. The phone also supports Qi wireless charging and Battery Share, i.e., reverse wireless charging.Out-of-the-box the Pixel 9 Pro Fold will come with Android 14 . There’s the usual Google promise of 7 years of OS and security updates.Would it even be a Pixel phone, if there’s no AI in it. Well, there’s a whole lot of AI. For starters Gemini is there, and it works in split-screen mode, as well. One could ask Gemini to write stuff or even get info about whats’s on the screen or photos. Circle To Search is also there, ohh and this feature can help you check if an image has been created using AI.The new “Pixel-exclusive” AI feature to arrive is Pixel Screenshots. The feature could organise or recall things, like events and location, all you need to is ask the phone.Google is giving one year of the Google One AI Premium plan for free to those who’ll buy the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. So, that’ll give you access to Gemini Advanced, Gemini in Gmail and Docs, on top of 2TB of cloud storage.The Pixel 9 Pro Fold ditches the camera visor for a squircle module that houses a triple lens setup – a 50MP wide camera, a 48MP ultraide and a 48MP 5x telephoto camera. For selfies, there's a 42 MP front-facing camera on the inner screen and 10MP camera on the outside.The camera hardware has been only a part of Pixel’s camera, but it’s AI that completes it. There’s a long list of AI features that complements the camera hardware on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. The usual Super Res Zoom, Zoom Enhance, Video Boost, Face Unblur, Photo Unblur, Best Take, Magic Eraser, Audio Eraser, and Magic Editor makes their return. Well, Magic Eraser now has an a “reimagine” feature that Google says can give photos a “whole new look.”One new AI tool to come to Google’s Pixel 9 pro Fold is the “Add Me,” which as you’d image can add you to a picture. So, how does it work? Well, you take photo with the group, swap in yourself, and AI will merge the photos.Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold is priced in India at Rs 1,72,999 and will be available for purchase later this year. While it comes in two colours – Obsidian and Porcelain – it’ll be available only in Obsidian colour in India.","Google has launched its second-generation Pixel foldable phone, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold.

Kerala woman loses Rs 12 lakh to custom fraud: Government shares biggest tip to spot such online custom frauds,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/kerala-woman-loses-rs-12-lakh-to-custom-fraud-government-shares-biggest-tip-to-spot-such-online-custom-frauds/articleshow/112644000.cms,"How the scammers operate

What can you do in case of custom fraud

Scammers keep finding new ways to trap people and steal money from their bank accounts. One of the most prevalent scams circulating today is the 'Customs Fraud'. This deceptive scheme involves fraudsters posing as customs officials, demanding payments for fictitious packages or parcels held in customs.A woman from Kerala recently fell prey to a custom fraud incurring a loss of Rs 12 lakh.The ordeal began when the woman received a call demanding Rs 15,000 as customs duty for a gift she was allegedly expecting. Believing the caller to be a genuine customs official, she paid the amount. However, the demands escalated as the fraudsters claimed to have discovered higher-value items in the parcel, including dollars worth Rs 10 lakh. The victim continued to pay as instructed, only to realise the scam when a friend alerted her.The government’s fact-checking division, ‘ PIB Fact Check ,’ recently issued a warning to internet users about Customs-related fraud through a post on X. The post features a video demonstrating how scammers deceive people, accompanied by a voice clip detailing the criminals’ tactics in these scams. It also provides essential guidelines to help individuals protect themselves from falling victim to such schemes.For those unaware, PIB Fact Check, as the name implies, checks for fake news and misinformation related to the Government of India.In the voice clip shared, scammers impersonate an officer from the Indian Customs department when they call their target. The call begins with a pre-recorded message, claiming there’s an issue with a parcel the target was sending online, or that the package contains something illegal.The message then prompts the user to press “9” for more details or support. Once “9” is pressed, the call connects to a representative who also pretends to be from the Customs department.Typically, the scammers attempt to intimidate or blackmail the target by alleging illegal contents in the package or demanding payment under the guise of taxes. This is where the scam unfolds.First and foremost, confirm whether you or anyone in your family has actually sent a courier. If not, it's best to ignore the call. To be extra cautious, you can verify any communication from Indian Customs using the Document Identification Number (DIN) on CBIC's website.Additionally, avoid clicking on any links sent to your phone, no matter how genuine they appear. Refrain from sharing any personal information over the call, as scammers can use that information to trap you further.Finally, be sure to report the incident to your local police or the Cyber Crime department.","A woman from Kerala recently fell prey to a custom fraud incurring a loss of Rs 12 lakh.

In a surprising verdict, a Pune district court has dismissed a 13-year-old lawsuit filed by the American fast-food chain Burger King Corporation against a locally-owned eatery with the same name. The US company had accused the Pune-based Burger King of trademark infringement and sought a permanent injunction, damages, and a halt to the use of the name. The court dismissed the lawsuit filed by the Burger King Corporation in 2011, seeking a permanent injunction restraining infringement of trademark.However, the court ruled in favor of the local eatery, stating that it had been operating under the name ""Burger King"" since 1991-92, well before the US chain entered the Indian market.The plaintiff's first Indian BURGER KING restaurant was opened in New Delhi on November 9, 2014, the court said.The court found no evidence to support Burger King Corporation's claim that customers were confused or misled by the local eatery's use of the name. Additionally, the company failed to prove any actual financial loss due to the alleged infringement. The court said the Burger King Corporation has ""miserably failed"" to prove that the eatery here had infringed its trademark Burger King while running the restaurant in Pune.Burger King filed the lawsuit against Anahita Irani and Shapoor Irani. The Iranis opposed the suit, saying it was filed with malafide intentions and to discourage business people who are bonafide users and retailers. They said that apart from the name Burger King, there was absolutely no similarity in the plaintiff's trademark and their own shop name.This decision may have implications for trademark disputes involving established local businesses and multinational corporations.The Pune-based restaurant owners had counterclaimed for damages due to the harassment they endured during the lengthy legal battle. They sought Rs 20 lakh as damages. The court, however, refused any monetary relief to them too, noting that apart from oral evidence, no other proof was submitted to substantiate their claims.","Pune court dismisses 13-year-old lawsuit filed by Burger King Corporation.
