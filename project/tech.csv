"EU has a 'warning' for banks, investment firms using AI",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/eu-has-a-warning-for-banks-investment-firms-using-ai/articleshow/110571587.cms,"What ESMA said about using AI in the financial sector



“Importantly, firms' decisions remain the responsibility of management bodies, irrespective of whether those decisions are taken by people or AI-based tools. Central to the use of AI in investment services is the unwavering commitment to act in clients' best interest, an overarching requirement which applies irrespective of the tools that the firm decides to adopt in the provision of services. The firm's management body should have an appropriate understanding of how AI technologies are applied and used within their firm and should ensure appropriate oversight of these technologies.”

“Europe has positioned itself as a pioneer, understanding the importance of its role as global standard setter.”

The European Union (EU) has a warning for banks and investment firms operating in the region. In its first statement on AI , the EU ’s securities watchdog, the European Securities and Markets Authority ( ESMA ) said that financial institutions that are using artificial intelligence (AI) cannot neglect boardroom responsibility and a legal obligation to protect their customers.The ESMA has also set out guidelines on how financial firms regulated in the 27-country bloc can use AI in day-to-day operations. These guidelines will help banks and investment firms to comply with the EU's MiFID securities law . This law increases the transparency across the EU's financial markets and standardises the regulatory disclosures required for firms operating in the region.The EU watchdog said that AI not only has the potential to enhance investment strategies and client services, but it also comes with inherent risks. With AI used for financial services, the possible impact on retail investor protection is likely to be significant, ESMA noted.The regulator said:In December 2023, the EU lawmakers passed the world's first comprehensive regulation for AI, called the AI Act. However, this new law still needs to be approved by the European Parliament and won't take effect until 2025 at the earliest.In a statement, the European commissioner who helped negotiate the deal, Thierry Breton, said:",The European Securities and Markets Authority ( ESMA) said that financial institutions that are using artificial intelligence (AI) cannot neglect boardroom responsibility and a legal obligation to protect their customers. ESMA has also set out guidelines on how financial firms regulated in the 27-country bloc can use AI in day-to-day operations.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110571574,imgsize-69020,width-400,resizemode-4/110571574.jpg"

Google , Microsoft and Facebook parent Meta , among other tech companies, have announced that they are coming together to work as an entity to develop components that link together AI accelerator chips in data centres to help process the vast amounts of data employed in AI tasks.Called the Ultra Accelerator Link (UALink) Promoter Group, the combine includes other players such as Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Broadcom, Intel, Cisco Systems and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE). According to a report by Reuters, these companies have developed a new industry standard for networking in AI data centres in an effort to break Nvidia ’s AI dominance in the market.As the AI technology boomed, Nvidia increasingly became the biggest player in the AI chip market with a share of around 80%. It is inching closer and is speculated to overtake Apple by market capitalisation.Tech giants like Google and Meta are looking to reduce their dependence on Nvidia, who is also supplying AI chips to various other tech companies as they need more power to train their AI models.Broadcom's rival in the networking and custom chip market - Marvell Technologies, is also not part of the group, the report added.“The industry needs an open standard that can be moved forward very quickly, in an open [format] that allows multiple companies to add value to the overall ecosystem. The industry needs a standard that allows innovation to proceed at a rapid clip unfettered by any single company,” said Forrest Norrod, AMD’s GM of data center solutions.The specifications – governing connections among different accelerators in a data centre – will be available in the third quarter of 2024 to the partner companies.","The Ultra Accelerator Link (UALink) Promoter Group includes other players such as Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Broadcom, Intel, Cisco Systems and Hewlett Packard Enterprise.

JioMart's new launch timeline

Reliance Industries is not per se taking on quick delivery platforms -- Blinkit, Swiggy Instamart, Zepto and Tata Group 's BBNow. The company's retail arm Reliance Retail will reportedly not launch a 10-minute delivery model similar to these platforms for its proposed re-entry into quick commerce venture next month. According to a report in Economic Times, Reliance Retail has formed an inter-departmental team for its re-entry into quick commerce. Reliance Retail’s chief executive for grocery business Damodar Mall, JioMart chief executive Sandeep Varaganti and a senior team in corporate which will be further expanded as more categories get added.Reliance entered grocery delivery space with JioMart during Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. However, the company followed the same model as Amazon and Flipkart and never got into 'same-day delivery' on the lines of Blinkit, Swiggy Instamart and others.The country’s largest retailer Reliance Retail is instead planning a 30-minute delivery model with a wider assortment than existing quick commerce companies which will be fed by Reliance’s own stores and the almost 20 lakh Kiranas who source products from the company. The report quotes two executives who are said to be aware of the plans. The Kranas are part of the JioMart Partner initiative whereby they source products from Reliance Retail’s wholesale arm and have their backend connected.As Reliance is not setting up dark stores like Blinkit, Instamart and others who have such warehouses in each locality for under-ten-minute delivery, the company will reportedly be using the tech platforms such as FYND and Locus for the fulfilment process and optimise delivery routes to ensure orders reach within 30 minutes.To start with, Reliance Retail’s quick commerce venture will initially sell only groceries. Moving forward, the company plans to add quick deliveries of apparel and electronics leveraging Reliance Retail's 19,000-plus store network.One of the executives reportedly said that the company’s research shows consumers are willing to wait for most products instead of wanting them within 10 minutes. “The value for consumers in Reliance's quick commerce will be on the wider assortment and deals. Moreover, Reliance’s venture will be expanded pan-India and not just the top 8-10 cities which current quick commerce companies focus on,” he said.Reliance's quick commerce venture will kick-off next month in eight cities such as Delhi-NCR, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Chennai, Pune, Hyderabad and Kolkata. The company has internally named the project as ‘ JioMart Express ’ which will be integrated in the existing JioMart app.Incidentally, in 2023, Reliance is said to have shelved its quick commerce pilot in Navi Mumbai when it was also called JioMart Express. The reason is said to be that Reliance then did not find the foray profitable since unit cost of deliveries are higher than e-commerce with buying ticket sizes low.Reliance Retail is not the only one looking at quick commerce space. Earlier this year, there have been reports of Flipkart being in discussions regarding a potential acquisition of Dunzo, the hyperlocal delivery startup backed by Reliance Retail. The talks, however, are said to have not succeeded.","Reliance Industries is not per se taking on quick delivery platforms -- Blinkit, Swiggy Instamart, Zepto and Tata Group's BBNow.

"How this cyberattack disabled more than 600,000 internet routers in the US",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-this-cyberattack-disabled-more-than-600000-internet-routers-in-the-us/articleshow/110570637.cms,"How this cyberattack affected internet routers in the US



What Lumen researchers said about the attack



“We assess with high confidence that the malicious firmware update was a deliberate act intended to cause an outage. Destructive attacks of this nature are highly concerning, especially so in this case. A sizeable portion of this ISP’s service area covers rural or underserved communities; places where residents may have lost access to emergency services, farming concerns may have lost critical information from remote monitoring of crops during the harvest, and health care providers cut off from tele-health or patients’ records.”

A massive cyberattack on a telecommunications company in the US in 2023 reportedly disabled thousands of internet routers . In a blog post, security analysts at Lumen Technologies ' Black Lotus Labs have published a research that claims that the cyberattack was carried out by an unidentified hacking group . The report also notes that the attack was discovered in the recent months.The cyberattack which took place in October (which was not disclosed at the time) made more than 600,000 internet routers offline.Some experts also believe this attack to be one of the most serious cyberattacks ever against the US telecommunications sector .As per the researchers, the hackers installed malicious software that disrupted internet access from October 25 to 27 across several US states. The analysts found the malware, which continued circulating, on the internet months later through certain file links that the hackers left visible.The report neither named the company that was attacked nor did it attribute the hack to a particular country or known group. The researchers said the attackers used common methods which made them harder to identify.The researchers also noted that the internet routers were disabled when a malicious firmware update was sent to the company's customers. This update deleted elements of the routers’ operational code and made them effectively inoperable. However, the report doesn’t note how exactly the firmware update was shipped to users.In the report, Lumen researchers said:Earlier, in February, US telecom giant AT&T faced a major outage that took several hours to fix. The telco claimed that this outage was caused due to an “erroneous procedure” implemented during the expansion of its wireless network.The software glitch disrupted wireless services for hundreds of thousands of users in the US. This outage also led to an investigation by the FBI and the US Department of Homeland Security on the company.",A massive cyberattack on a telecommunications company in the US in 2023 reportedly disabled thousands of internet routers.

What the EU has to say about the Italian rule



Google , Amazon and Airbnb have won the support of the European Union 's top court in their fight against a ruling passed by Italy. The law passed by the European nation required companies including the Alphabet-owned tech giant, the e-commerce major and the online room booking platform to provide information on themselves.The European headquarters of both Google and Airbnb are in Ireland, while Amazon is based in Luxembourg.Apart from these companies, US-based online travel services platform Expedia, whose European headquarters is based in Spain, has also objected to the requirement.Italy adopted this new rule against tech companies in 2020 and 2021. According to a report by the news agency Reuters, this rule has caused this dispute between the companies and the country's authorities.This rule mandates online service providers operating in Italy to sign up to a register and submit various types of information. The law also forces companies to pay a financial contribution or risk a fine for failing to do the same.The companies have challenged the requirement and have argued that it contradicts EU legislation. As per the EU’s rules, online service providers are only subject to the laws of the country where they are established. TheEU law also says that countries where the service is provided must refrain from enforcing their rules.While discussing the Italian law, judges in the Luxembourg-based Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) ruled: “A member state may not impose additional obligations on an online service provider established in another member state. Italy cannot impose on providers of those services established in other member states additional obligations which, although required for the provision of those services in that country, are not imposed in their member state of establishment.”In November 2023, the EU’s regulatory watchdog, the European Commission designated six technology giants as gatekeepers under the Digital Markets Act (DMA). Companies including Google-parent Alphabet , Amazon, Apple, ByteDance and Meta were also given six months to ensure compliance with the DMA obligations.",Italy adopted this new rule against tech companies in 2020 and 2021.

Apple may bring iPhone 16 series in two new colours: Details,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/mobiles-tabs/apple-may-bring-iphone-16-series-in-two-new-colours-details/articleshow/110260524.cms,"

Pro models may get a new Rose colour

Apple

may rename existing colours

Apple iPhone 16 series launch is months away. But the rumour mill is buzzing with expected features, design and now colour of the 2024 iPhone lineup. Popular Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo says that the Cupertino-based company may add two new colours to the iPhone 16, replacing the existing ones.The information was shared by Kuo in a post on X, formerly Twitter .In the post, Kuo says that the Pro models - iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max could be offered in black, white or silver, gray or ""Natural Titanium,"" and an all-new rose. The existing iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max are offered in Black Titanium, White Titanium, Blue Titanium and Natural Titanium colours.Kuo reveals that the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus are expected to come in black, green, pink, blue and white colour variants. Apple may also rename previous colours as well, Kuo adds. For example, the existing white could be renamed to starlight. “Also, even if the colour name is the same as the existing model, it may look different”, he says.Earlier, Kuo said that the iPhone 16 Pro Max is expected to feature a new battery with better energy density, potentially enhancing battery life if Apple maintains the same battery size. According to Kuo, iPhone 16 Pro Max will reportedly see a substantial redesign of its battery, switching from an aluminium to a stainless steel casing. This shift not only increases the battery's energy density but also improves its structural integrity. While stainless steel is less effective at dissipating heat compared to aluminium, it offers stronger protection, which could be beneficial for the overall durability of the device.In a related news, display analyst Ross Young said that the display production for Apple iPhone 16 will begin next month. This is on schedule with the timing of last year’s iPhone 15 production and the 2024 iPhone series launch may follow the same timeline as last year.","Apple may add two new colours to the iPhone 16, replacing the existing ones.

In a bold move at the Cannes Film Festival, Polish director Patryk Vega unveiled his latest project, a biopic titled ""Putin,"" featuring an AI-generated deepfake of Russian President Vladimir Putin . The film, which has already been sold in 50 countries ahead of its September premiere, uses advanced artificial intelligence to replicate Putin's face on a real actor’s body.Vega, known for his popular Polish films, decided to use AI technology to create a more authentic portrayal of Putin.""To come extremely close to the dictator, we needed Putin, not an actor with make-up,"" Vega explained. The film’s trailer opens with a striking scene of the Russian leader cowering on the floor in diapers, setting the tone for its controversial narrative.As per an ET report, Vega humorously recounted his approach: ""I called Putin and asked him if he wanted to play in my movie... No, that was a joke."" Despite the jest, the director utilised AI to generate Putin's face due to the lack of sufficient high-resolution images for a full-body deepfake. The results, according to early viewers, are uncannily realistic.""Putin"" chronicles the life of the Russian president over six decades, starting from his childhood at age 10, where he is depicted being beaten by his stepfather. The film culminates in a fictional portrayal of his death, which Vega describes as ""a happy end.""The concept for the biopic emerged during the early days of Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Initially, Vega aimed to make a film about the Russian mafia but shifted focus to what he considered ""the biggest gangster.""Despite potential risks, Vega dismisses fears of reprisals, boldly stating, ""Putin should be afraid of me."" The director's venture into AI has broader implications for the film industry, particularly in Hollywood, where the technology is both a boon and a source of concern. AI advancements threaten traditional roles, especially among special effects technicians and extras, raising fears of job losses.These concerns were central to last year's strike by actors and writers, culminating in an agreement that included compensation for the use of AI-generated likenesses. Despite apprehensions, AI is already extensively used in the industry. For example, it was employed to de-age Harrison Ford in the latest ""Indiana Jones"" film, though studios often refrain from publicising these uses.Beyond film production, AI's applications are expanding in various sectors of the media. The Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media, for instance, uses algorithms to analyse screenplays for gender and diversity biases. YouTube, a significant player in film promotion and distribution, has leveraged AI for over a decade, employing it for automated subtitles and copyright protections.Since April, YouTube has begun labelling AI-generated content and enhancing its detection programs. Justine Ryst, head of YouTube France, emphasised that ""AI isn't going to take over creation. It's going to simplify the complex, and make possible the impossible."" She advocated for a balance between innovation and responsibility in utilising AI.","Polish director Patryk Vega unveiled his latest project, a biopic titled ""Putin,"" featuring an AI-generated deepfake of Russian President Vladimir Putin.

But any returns beyond that amount—and if we are successful, we expect to generate orders of magnitude more value than we’d owe to people who invest in or work at OpenAI LP—are owned by the original OpenAI Nonprofit entity,” the blog then stated.OpenAI restricting comes amidst reports of the company stringking a deal with tech giant Apple to integrate ChatGPT in the to-be-announced iOS 18 . The partnership could be announced at the upcoming WorldWide Developers Conference ( WWDC ) from June 10 to June 14.The deal ‘could be worth billions of dollars to the startup if everything goes well’, reports The Information citing people aware of the matter.In a latest, Sam Altman-led OpenAI has signed content and product partnerships with The Atlantic and Vox Media to boost and train its products using their content.
