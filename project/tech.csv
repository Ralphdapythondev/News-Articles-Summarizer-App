TikTok has announced plans to use "" Content Credentials "" – a digital watermark – to label all images and videos uploaded to its platform that are created with artificial intelligence ( AI ). The move comes as tech companies have announced that they will label AI-generated content.Previously, TikTok labeled AI content created with tools within its app.This change will now apply labels to videos and images generated with external AI tools such as those offered by OpenAI , Google and Microsoft .“We also have policies in place that prohibit unlabeled realistic AI content. If such content appears on our platform, it will be removed for violating our community guidelines,” stated Adam Presser, head of operations and trust and safety at TikTok.Concerns have been raised by researchers that AI-generated content could be used to disrupt upcoming US elections. TikTok is part of a group of 20 tech companies that signed an agreement earlier this year to combat this issue.Early adopters of Content Credentials include ChatGPT creator OpenAI. Additionally, YouTube (owned by Google) and Meta (owner of Instagram and Facebook) have expressed plans to utilise this technology.For Content Credentials tech to function, both the creator of the AI tool used to generate content and the platform distributing the content need to agree on using this industry standard. For instance, when someone uses OpenAI's Dall-E tool to generate an image, OpenAI attaches a watermark and adds data to the file. This data can later be used to verify if the image has been altered.If such a marked image is uploaded to TikTok, it will be automatically labeled as AI-generated.",TikTok will label all images and videos uploaded to its platform that are created with artificial intelligence ( AI ).

Google CEO Sundar Pichai on how he and his kids use AI at home,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-ceo-sundar-pichai-on-how-he-and-his-kids-use-ai-at-home/articleshow/109989455.cms,"‘Google prepared for frenzy around AI’

Google CEO Sundar Pichai has made artificial intelligence (AI) a core focus for the company. In addition to offering AI-powered tools to Google users, Pichai utilises them to assist his children's education. He also said that the company is ready for the frenzy around the technology.In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Pichai was asked how he is experimenting with AI at home with kids.He said he helps his son with homework.“We use Google Lens for homework. I don’t want to get him in trouble, but the class allows you to do that,” Pichai said.“But sometimes he asks me for help on math. Sometimes I’m lazy and I pretend as if I’m thinking but I’m also using Google Lens to kind of figure out the answer,” he added. Pichai is father to a daughter and a son.While discussing the excitement around AI, Pichai said that all tech cycles are “this way” but AI is bigger.“We still have a long way to go. We are in [the] early stages of that. And so you’re going to feel that excitement, that frenzy. But I think we are prepared for it,” Pichai said.“So you kind of roll with the flow. You embrace it,” he added.Pichai also talked about how the company purportedly lost the chatbot moment toOpenAI and Microsoft .“We weren’t the first company to search. We weren’t the first company to do email. We weren’t the first company to build a browser...So I view this AI as we are in the earliest possible stages,” he said.On the competition posed by Microsoft, OpenAI and other AI companies, the Google CEO said that there’s always a lot of competition when it comes to technology.“We see it all the time. The way you stay ahead is by innovating relentlessly. It has to be true all the time. It’s happening at a faster pace. Technology changes tend to get faster over time. So it’s not surprising to me at all,” he added.","Google CEO Sundar Pichai has made artificial intelligence a core focus for the company.

"Communications Workers of America: 'We ask, where is the respect and compassion from Microsoft'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/communications-workers-of-america-we-ask-where-is-the-respect-and-compassion-from-microsoft/articleshow/109989777.cms,"released a statement addressing the Microsoft. Here's the statement:

Microsoft announced that it is closing studios Arkane Austin, Tango Gameworks, and Alpha Dog Games and reassigning the Roundhouse Studios Team to ZeniMax Online Studios. This announcement highlights the need for workers in the

video game industry

to organize, particularly as layoffs become the norm, even at highly profitable companies. While union representation can't always protect against layoffs, the bargaining process enables video game workers to establish greater transparency and policies that put their needs first, including layoff protections. The watershed contract secured earlier this year by workers at Sega of America with CWA’s help included enhanced layoff protections and severance benefits, and CWA-represented workers at ZeniMax – who were not directly impacted by this week’s announced changes – hope to establish similar protections as they continue to negotiate the first collectively bargained contract in Microsoft’s history.

“In his email announcing the layoffs, Xbox Game Studios head Matt Booty urged us to treat our departing colleagues with ‘respect and compassion.’ We ask, where is the respect and compassion from Microsoft? These layoffs had nothing to do with the quality of work and everything to do with management’s decision to prioritize profit over those who worked on and loved these games. Every video game worker deserves not only their fair share, but also the peace of mind that comes from having a say over the impact of job cuts. We encourage and support all video game workers to organize for a voice on the job,” said Zach Lyon, a Senior II QA Tester at ZeniMax and union member.

Microsoft this week announced that it is shutting down a number of game studios. In an email to employees, head of Xbox Game Studios Matt Booty announced the closure of several game studios, including Redfall developer Arkane Austin , Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks , Alpha Dog Games, and more. Xbox reportedly began offering voluntary severance agreements to producers, quality assurance testers and other staff at ZeniMax , which it purchased in 2020 for $7.5 billion, according to people familiar with the company’s plans.Others across the Xbox organization have reportedly been told that more cuts are on the way.These cuts at Xbox come amid a wider contraction in the video-game industry due to economic shifts following a period of rapid growth during the pandemic. Recently, Microsoft’s gaming division has expanded more than any of its competitors via the acquisitions of ZeniMax and Activision Blizzard for more than $76 billion combined. In February, Microsoft cut 1,900 jobs, mostly at Activision Blizzard.The massive Activision Blizzard acquisition has ramped up scrutiny on the Xbox division from leaders at Microsoft, according to people familiar.Reacting to these job cuts, Communications Workers of America (CWA)","Microsoft announced that it is closing studios Arkane Austin, Tango Gameworks, and Alpha Dog Games and reassigning the Roundhouse Studios Team to ZeniMax Online Studios.

Availability of the new features

WhatsApp has announced a major design refresh for its mobile apps, including a ""darker dark mode,"" a streamlined look, and platform-specific improvements for both Android and Apple iPhone users. According to WhatsApp, the update represents a shift towards a more balanced approach, acknowledging the need for continued functionality while also prioritizing a modern and user-friendly design.This comes after years of primarily focusing on adding new features.One of the most anticipated changes is the ""darker dark mode."" WhatsApp experimented with over 35 different color palettes before settling on a combination that reduces eye strain in low-light environments. This builds on the existing dark mode option, a popular feature among many users.Android users will benefit from a new native bottom navigation bar, similar to what iOS users have enjoyed for some time. This bar provides quick access to key sections of the app: Chats, Calls, Communities, and Status Updates.For iPhone users, WhatsApp is revamping the media attachment layout. The previous full-screen menu is replaced with a more concise expandable tray. This should make it easier to select options for sending photos, videos, documents, polls, and other media.The update also includes a refresh of the app's icons, adopting a rounded, outlined style for a more contemporary look. Additionally, the default chat background is getting a revamp, though specific details about the new design haven't been revealed yet.The update is expected to roll out gradually over the coming weeks.

How Hong Kong's ban on this protest song has put Google in 'trouble',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-hong-kongs-ban-on-this-protest-song-has-put-google-in-trouble/articleshow/109989282.cms,"Why Google's response to the ban important

In a recent development, Hong Kong has intensified its legal efforts against Google , demanding the removal of a protest anthem from the city’s internet. The Court of Appeal sanctioned an injunction to prevent the song “Glory to Hong Kong” from being played with seditious intent. This ruling places a new burden on internet platforms, potentially exposing them to legal risks for merely hosting the content.Judges have stated that prosecuting individuals alone does not sufficiently address the issue, hence the need for the injunction to compel internet platform operators to act.Ryan Neelam of the Lowy Institute highlighted the dilemma faced by companies like Google, caught between their commitment to free speech and legal compliance, which could have a wider dampening effect on expression if tech giants adhere to the order.Google’s response to this injunction is poised to be a pivotal moment for internet freedom in Hong Kong. Compliance could signal the encroachment of China’s stringent censorship practices into the region, which traditionally does not restrict foreign media and search engines.Despite the potential ramifications, including fines and operational restructuring, Google has not commented on the situation. The Hong Kong government has also remained silent. The American company’s significant presence in Hong Kong means that non-compliance could necessitate a strategic overhaul of its Asian business model.The injunction has raised concerns among the US government and human rights organizations about its impact on Hong Kong’s status as a financial center. The city’s Chief Executive, John Lee, has emphasized the importance of information freedom to Hong Kong’s global business appeal.The Asia Internet Coalition, representing major tech firms, is evaluating the court’s decision to understand its implications for their operations. Hong Kong’s Secretary for Justice, Paul Lam, expects compliance from internet companies, stating that the injunction aims to deter service providers from facilitating unlawful activities.The injunction targets 32 YouTube links to the song and related content on search engines, including Google, Yahoo, and Bing. Despite the order, many of these links remained accessible in Hong Kong.The ruling has overturned a previous court decision and has been criticized by human rights groups as an act of digital repression. They urge tech companies to resist the ban and suggest that US lawmakers should scrutinize the companies’ stance on such issues.The controversy surrounding “Glory to Hong Kong” dates back to its association with anti-government protests in 2019 and subsequent international incidents where it was mistakenly played instead of the Chinese national anthem. Google’s historical refusal to remove the song has led to increased government pressure, culminating in the current legal injunction.As the situation unfolds, the actions of American tech giants in response to the injunction will be closely watched, with potential implications for their global reputation and commitment to human rights.","Hong Kong has intensified its legal efforts against Google, demanding the removal of a protest anthem from the city’s internet.

Samsung is reportedly working on a feature that will use artificial intelligence ( AI ) to detect AFiB (Atrial Fibrillation). The South Korean tech giant has reportedly filed a patent for the same. It is likely that the feature may come with the next generation Galaxy Watch.AFiB is an irregular and often rapid heart rate that can lead to blood clots, strokes and other heart conditions.Over the years, health features have become dominant features on smart wearables, especially smartwatches. Apple introduced its ECG app in 2019 with Apple Watch Series 4 to alert users of irregular heart beats or AFiB. Samsung also allows users to record and monitor ECG (electrocardiogram) data to track heart’s rhythm and health.So then why the need for a new method?Because Samsung seems to believe that the current methods of monitoring are not necessarily accurate.The new patent filed by Samsung suggests that it aims to detect AfiB with the help of generative AI . With the help of AI, photoplethysmograph (PPG) signals will be converted into ECG signals. A PPG signal has several components including volumetric changes in arterial blood which is associated with cardiac activity. It measures the amount of light absorbed and reflected by human tissues.Meanwhile, Samsung is planning to launch a new premium smartwatch. In the financial report for Q1, 2024, the company revealed that it will launch a new premium smartwatch model which will join the Galaxy Watch 7 series.“For smartwatches, the MX Business will strive to meet demand for upgrades through the launch of new premium models,” mentions the company.Although the report didn't specify the exact release date or offer further details, it mentions that the desired upgrades requested by users will be incorporated into the higher-end models.Recent online rumours suggest that Samsung may launch three models of the upcoming Galaxy Watch 7 series.

A captivating romance can uplift anyone's spirits, and anime has a unique ability to vividly portray these narratives. Over the years, Japanese animation has delivered numerous romantic tales, ranging from light-hearted comedies to deeply emotional dramas.For romance enthusiasts, going through so many anime options can be overwhelming. However, there are several exceptional romance anime series that truly shine above the rest.Here is a curated list of top romance anime series , compiled by Game Rant, along with their respective rankings.Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie stirred mixed reactions upon its debut in Spring 2022, often compared to ""My Dress-Up Darling"" but standing out as a unique slice-of-life anime centred around a charming couple, Shikimori and Yuu Izumi.One distinctive aspect of the series is its portrayal of the main couple already in a relationship, a rarity in anime. While the episodes focus on everyday moments, they paint a wholesome picture of young love with two endearing characters navigating the nuances of romance.Describing Bakemonogatari as a straightforward romance might be a stretch, but this instalment of Monogatari indeed focuses on and highlights the relationship between Koyomi Araragi and Hitagi Senjougahara. Their initial interactions are unconventional, involving a stapler to the face, but Araragi's determination to assist Senjougahara with her curse ultimately brings them closer.Despite the surreal and eccentric nature of Monogatari, the romance between Araragi and Senjougahara is remarkably grounded and healthy. While the series introduces other potential romantic interests, their relationship remains steadfast and central to the narrative.""Sing 'Yesterday' for Me"" presents romance in a refreshingly realistic manner compared to many other anime. The series takes a classic love triangle and steers it in an unexpected direction by the end, resulting in a highly satisfying conclusion that portrays how failed romances can evolve into strong friendships.Directed by Yoshiyuki Fujiwara, known for his work on popular anime like ""Attack on Titan"" and ""Sword Art Online,"" the shift to a show with such a different tone demonstrates his versatility and mastery in storytelling across diverse genres.""My Happy Marriage"" emerged as one of the standout romance anime of Summer 2023, adapted from Akumi Agitogi's novel series. Set in an alternate Meiji Restoration era with supernatural elements, the story follows Miyo, who endures mistreatment from her stepfamily despite her privileged background. Her family arranges her marriage to a notorious military figure known for rejecting wives quickly, with rejection spelling disaster for Miyo. However, Kiyoka surprises everyone by taking an interest in Miyo and becoming incensed by her family's cruelty.The anime delves into the lasting impact of Miyo's abuse, highlighting her struggle to regain self-worth, even with Kiyoka's support. Kiyoka himself is a complex character with hidden motives behind his initial attraction to Miyo, although his feelings for her are genuine.While the romance between Miyo and Kiyoka is heartwarming, ""My Happy Marriage"" falls short in other areas. The supernatural elements can seem disjointed, and the villains are one-dimensional despite being detestable.Based on Fumita Yanagida's popular and finished manga, ""Tomo-chan Is a Girl!"" stood out as one of Winter 2023's most amusing romantic comedies. Tomo and Jun share a close friendship, but Jun sees Tomo strictly as a friend, unaware of her romantic feelings.While romance is central to its characters, ""Tomo-chan Is a Girl!"" leans heavily into comedy. Tomo and Jun's dynamic is charming, and they're supported by entertaining characters like Misuzu and Carol. Despite its comedic tone, the chemistry between Tomo and Jun develops convincingly over the season. Unlike some romance anime, Tomo-chan excels in portraying why its leads are compatible without difficulty.Teen romance anime often dominate the genre, but there are exceptions worth noting. ""Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku"" is primarily a workplace comedy that revolves around two couples: the newly formed pair of Hirotaka Nifuji and Narumi Momose, and the more established couple, Tarou Kabakura and Hanako Koyanagi. The focus remains on Hirotaka and Narumi, with the series emphasising humour over romance, but Tarou and Hanako's relationship is depicted realistically.Despite being childhood friends, Narumi struggles to see Hirotaka as a potential romantic interest, a dynamic that persists throughout the series. The anime's brevity limits the depth of these relationships, but ""Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku"" provides an entertaining journey within its runtime.""Romantic Killer"" cleverly parodies romance and harem anime while paying homage to their core strengths. Anzu, a girl with no interest in boys, is suddenly thrust into a reverse harem scenario by a magical being, disrupting her life of gaming and chocolate consumption. Unamused by her newfound romantic entanglements with unfamiliar guys, Anzu navigates this unconventional situation with scepticism.Primarily a comedy, ""Romantic Killer"" aims to elicit laughter from its audience, often succeeding with its humour rooted in its origins as a shonen manga, characterised by exaggerated facial expressions.Though not always aiming for emotional depth, the anime treats its characters and their relationships seriously. Anzu shines as a compelling lead, and the male characters introduced as potential partners are well-developed. ""Romantic Killer"" offers a delightful blend of humour and romance for those seeking an entertaining and unconventional love story.""The Angel Next Door Spoils Me Rotten"" captivates viewers from the start for several reasons. Firstly, Project No.9's animation is impressive, featuring clean and detailed character designs. Secondly, and most importantly, the main characters exhibit instant chemistry, evident when Amane offers his umbrella to a soaked Mahiru, sparking a connection.Throughout the series, despite the frequent presence of both leads on screen, ""The Angel Next Door Spoils Me Rotten"" effectively delves into their individual personalities while also developing their friendship.Rumiko Takahashi is celebrated as a legendary mangaka, known for classics like Inuyasha, Ranma 1/2, and Urusei Yatsura. While most of her renowned works fall within the shonen genre, Takahashi has also ventured into seinen storytelling. Maison Ikkoku stands out as one of her most mature works, emphasising romance as its primary theme.Unlike Takahashi's prominent shonen series that explore various genres such as comedy and action alongside romance, Maison Ikkoku focuses squarely on romantic elements, enriched with drama, character development, and humour.The central relationship features Kyouko and Yuusaku, both drawn to each other but hindered by their circumstances. Kyouko, grieving the recent loss of her husband, is hesitant to move forward. Meanwhile, Yuusaku, deeply in love with Kyouko, doubts his worthiness as a student. The anime chronicles their journeys of growth, healing, and mutual misunderstanding, complemented by well-developed secondary characters.Insomniacs After School emerged as the standout romance of Spring 2023, adapted from Makoto Ojiro's esteemed seinen manga. The story revolves around two students plagued by insomnia, a burden they carried alone until they met at their school's observatory. Isaki and Ganta form an immediate bond, which deepens as they work together to revive the Astronomy Club, driven by their shared need to preserve their newfound sanctuary.The anime boasts impeccable pacing, skillfully depicting the protagonists' isolation due to insomnia and the subtle solace they find in each other. While romance is a central theme, the series prioritises developing Ganta and Isaki's friendship before advancing their relationship, emphasising the depth of their connection beyond shared circumstances.Kokoro Connect injects a supernatural twist into a classic love triangle scenario. The story centers around Taichi, Iori, Yui, Yoshifumi, and Himeko, students of the Student Cultural Research Club, whose lives take a turn when they receive supernatural abilities from a mysterious being named Heartseed.As they grapple with these newfound powers, the group experiences sensory phenomena that challenge their relationships and reveal hidden aspects of their personalities. The anime is rich in character development, providing an engaging and thought-provoking experience.Maid Sama! carries many tropes that might derail other romance anime: an overly perfect male lead, a strong female protagonist reduced to a damsel, and an unnecessary love triangle. Despite these shortcomings, Maid Sama! shines through its strong personality.The heart of Maid Sama! lies in the relationship between Takumi Usui, a charming heartthrob, and Misaki Ayuzawa, a strict student council president with a busy schedule balancing school, home, and work. When Takumi discovers Misaki's secret job at a maid cafe, it opens a new perspective on the usually composed president.In ""Rascal Does Not Dream Of Bunny Girl Senpai,"" romance plays a subtle yet compelling role that defines the series. The story centers on Sakuta Azusagawa, a high school student drawn to girls suffering from Adolescence Syndrome, a condition linked to their insecurities.While the anime unfolds through different arcs focusing on various girls, the standout is the initial saga featuring Mai Sakurajima, an actress who forms a close bond with Sakuta. Their dynamic crackles with romantic tension, warmth, and clever banter. Although not always in the foreground, their relationship develops steadily across subsequent arcs, leading to a satisfying sequel in the form of a feature film.Wakana Gojou and Marin Kitagawa inhabit completely contrasting worlds. Gojou, isolated and reserved, keeps himself apart from others due to his passion for hina dolls, fearing ridicule. In contrast, Kitagawa is popular, outgoing, and self-assured.Despite their differences, Kitagawa becomes intrigued by cosplay and sees Gojou as the ideal person to create outfits for her. ""My Dress-Up Darling"" is a charming, humorous, and beautifully animated romance anime that excels in executing classic genre tropes with finesse.""Toradora!"" is a beloved slice-of-life romantic comedy that offers a wonderful entry point into the genre. The story revolves around Ryuji Yusaku and Taiga Aisaka, two students who have crushes on each other's best friends.Both Ryuji and Taiga are viewed as outcasts—Ryuji due to his intimidating appearance and Taiga because of her fiery temper. They team up to assist each other in their romantic pursuits. The series delves into their evolving dynamic and the humorous mishaps that ensue as they navigate their intertwined love lives.""The Pet Girl of Sakurasou"" depicts the journey of an eccentric group of characters as they navigate growth and self-discovery. Sorata Kanda is forced to move into the unconventional Sakura House after being kicked out of his school's main dorms.In Sakura House, Sorata encounters talented yet troubled students. When a peculiar young artist joins the dorm, Sorata takes on the responsibility of helping her adjust to her new life. The series delves into the interactions among the dorm mates, their personal aspirations, and the interconnected nature of their relationships.""Ouran High School Host Club"" is a delightful reverse harem anime filled with lighthearted and meaningful moments. Haruhi Fujioka accidentally breaks an antique vase belonging to her school's Host Club and must repay her debt by disguising herself as a boy and working as a host.The series excels in developing Haruhi's character along with her fellow hosts, providing insight into their motivations and personalities. It's a must-watch for shojo fans, featuring a memorable cast of characters that carries the show through its run.Kyoto Animation has produced many beloved anime, and ""Love, Chunibyo & Other Delusions!"" is among them. The series centers around a phenomenon known as Chunibyo, where adolescents have grandiose and unrealistic delusions.Yuta Togashi, who has outgrown his delusional phase, aims for a normal high school life. However, things take a turn when his classmate, Rikka Takanashi, reminds him of his past and tries to pull him back into the world of Chunibyo with her own delusions. The series delves into their relationship as Yuta unravels the triggers behind Rikka's delusions.The trope of opposites attracting may be overused, but when done well, it can lead to a captivating romantic comedy. ""Kimi ni Todoke"" explores the endearing friendship between the shy Sawako Kuronuma and the popular Shouta Kazehaya. Sawako, often mistaken for Sadako from ""The Ring,"" is isolated at school due to her appearance, making it challenging for her to break out of her shell. Fortunately, Kazehaya is just the right person to help her.""Kimi ni Todoke"" is a delightful and heartwarming anime with well-developed characters who evolve as the story unfolds. While it adheres to typical romance anime pacing, the journey remains engaging and enjoyable.Unlike most romance stories that focus on the process of falling in love, ""Tonikawa: Over The Moon For You"" follows a married couple who have already reached that point. As a result, the anime adopts a slice-of-life approach, showcasing Nasa and Tsukasa's daily life and antics rather than a typical romantic journey. ""Tonikawa"" doesn't rely on dramatic highs but instead offers a pleasant and light-hearted experience.While this anime may not appeal to everyone, it serves as a refreshing departure from more melodramatic romance shows. Despite their tendency to blush at the slightest physical contact, Nasa and Tsukasa are refreshingly direct in expressing their feelings, making them both witty and likeable characters.This romantic anime shines because of its main character, Takeo Gouda. His towering, imposing presence contrasts beautifully with his heartfelt affection for the delicate Rinko, which is truly heartwarming. Takeo's efforts to play matchmaker for Rinko with his best friend, despite his own feelings, demonstrate his genuine kindness.Viewers will undoubtedly root for Takeo and Rinko's endearing relationship. ""My Love Story!!"" delivers the goods without delay, as the main characters are dating for most of the episodes, bypassing the typical slow build-up to a confession.""A Sign of Affection"" is a heartwarming romantic comedy centred on college-age love and the challenges of communication. While not the sole focus of the story, Yuki and Itsuomi stand out as the main couple, instantly captivating viewers. Yuki, who is hearing-impaired, communicates using sign language, text, and by reading lips, while Itsuomi is a world traveller passionate about learning languages. Their connection begins on a train and grows stronger with each subsequent encounter.The anime beautifully captures the intense emotions of falling in love, highlighted by a poignant moment in the opening episode. With an older cast, ""A Sign of Affection"" takes on a more mature tone compared to typical romance anime. Throughout the season, Yuki and Itsuomi become increasingly comfortable around each other, resulting in consistently endearing interactions.This romantic anime is ideal for LGBTQ+ viewers seeking representation on screen, but its well-crafted storytelling makes it enjoyable for all audiences. The heartwarming romance blossoms between Mafuyu and Ritsuka as Mafuyu learns to play guitar and sing in Ritsuka's band.Watching Mafuyu's growing confidence alongside the romantic tension creates a compelling series that's hard to resist. The accompanying movie is also outstanding and a must-watch continuation of the series.Nana is one of the most renowned and beloved shoujo anime of all time, a must-watch for fans of romance and beyond. The series follows two women named Nana, seemingly different but navigating curiously similar life situations that lead to separate outcomes.Without giving away how their stories intertwine, Nana's 47 episodes delve into the protagonists' perspectives on love through various relationships. Grounded in reality, the anime explores complex characters who, despite occasional extremes, face accountability for their actions.Your Lie in April, one of the most famous romance anime, revolves around two music prodigies: Kousei Arima and Kaori Miyazono. Kousei, grappling with depression after his mother's death, loses his passion for the piano and withdraws from the performance arts. One day, he hears Kaori playing her violin with such freedom that it reignites his love for music and sparks his admiration for her.The anime delves into themes of grief, life, love, and music. Kousei's journey toward self-healing is profound, marked by heartbreak, but also punctuated by moments of beauty, tenderness, and joy.In this anime, Miyuki and Kaguya engage in a battle of wits to avoid confessing their love first, using their intellect and skills to outmaneuver each other. Both are determined not to be seen as the one who gives in.Their antics running the student council at an elite school with their friends are uproariously funny yet also contain heartwarming moments that will make viewers cheer. Season 3 of Kaguya-sama: Love is War, which aired in Spring 2022, leaned heavily into comedy but also devoted more time to developing Miyuki and Kaguya's relationship and touching on other romances.If the anime follows the manga, the next season of Love is War promises to be predominantly romantic. If successful, this upcoming release could elevate Kaguya-sama to the pinnacle of romance anime.This anime consists of two parts: Clannad and After Story. The latter surpasses the former by a wide margin, but watching Clannad is essential to fully appreciate the impact of After Story. While it features a diverse cast of supporting characters, the heart of the show revolves around Tomoya Okazaki and Nagisa Furukawa, delivering a profound narrative.Unlike typical romance series, Clannad After Story unfolds beyond high school, depicting the growth of Tomoya and Nagisa as individuals and as a couple. The anime tackles real-life challenges without glossing over them, offering a genuine exploration of common struggles.The Dangers in My Heart is truly brilliant. At first glance, it may seem like another typical shounen romance where a popular girl falls for an ordinary loner guy. These stories often offer little beyond wish fulfilment, and The Dangers in My Heart initially appears to fit that mould. Yet, the anime stands out.Ichikawa is an average guy with few friends who daydreams about unusual things. While the anime doesn't delve deeply into these thoughts, it doesn't ignore them either, leaving Ichikawa with a poor first impression. On the other hand, Anna is a cheerful but shy girl who loves food and works as a model. After a chance encounter at the school library, the two start spending time together, developing a friendship that hints at something deeper. Anna encourages Ichikawa to break out of his shell, leading to significant changes in him over the course of two seasons.Although slow-paced initially, The Dangers in My Heart evolves into something special by the end of season 1, maintaining its momentum in the subsequent cour and establishing itself as one of the best romance anime of all time. Anna and Ichikawa are both exceptional characters, but Anna's depth is what elevates the show. She's not just an idealised plot device; she's a fully realised character with insecurities, quirks, and vulnerabilities. Her interest in Ichikawa feels genuine, and vice versa. This is a rare quality in romance anime.Fruits Basket is the definitive romance anime, masterfully blending drama and comedy. Tooru Honda, a lovable protagonist, faces life's challenges until she moves in with the Souma family. The Soumas, particularly Yuki, are school idols hiding a shocking secret that alters perceptions.Love triangles often lack depth, favouring one partner over the other. Fruits Basket defies this norm with its compelling love triangle, where each character is fully developed. Across three seasons, Fruits Basket takes viewers on an unforgettable journey.Also read | 15 best anime series of all time; here's the list","Japanese animation has delivered numerous romantic tales, ranging from light- hearted comedies to deeply emotional dramas.

A higher credit score signifies a strong credit profile, increasing the likelihood of receiving credit approvals from lenders.By leveraging credit scores, CIBIL facilitates responsible lending practices and enables borrowers with solid credit histories to access credit facilities confidently.
