The Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) has taken down the globally active hacking group Radar/Dispossessor . The operation involved taking down servers across the US, UK, and Germany, disrupting the group's ability to launch attacks. The criminal ransomware group reportedly targeted 43 companies, including in India, in sectors such as healthcare and transport.“Since its inception in August 2023, Radar/Dispossessor has quickly developed into an internationally impactful ransomware group, targeting and attacking small-to-mid-sized businesses and organisations from the production, development, education, healthcare, financial services, and transportation sectors,” the FBI said.“Originally focused on entities in the US, the investigation discovered 43 companies as victims of the attacks, from countries including Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Honduras, India, Canada, Croatia, Peru, Poland, the United Kingdom, the United Arab Emirates, and Germany,” the agency added.Dispossessor group’s activities are said to be similar to LockBit, which provided ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) and was taken down earlier this year. The group was led by the online moniker “Brain” and targeted small to medium-sized companies.The hacking group employed aggressive tactics, including doxxing (digital stalking) victims, leaking stolen data and threatening to expose illegal activities. The ransomware gang's modus operandi involved stealing data before encrypting systems, increasing pressure on victims to pay the ransom.The group also leveraged compromised systems, weak passwords and lack of two-factor authentication to gain initial access to target networks. Once in a company’s IT systems where data is stored, the group would encrypt it and then hold it for ransom.“Once the company was attacked, if they did not contact the criminal actor, the group would then proactively contact others in the victim company, either through email or phone call. The emails also included links to video platforms on which the previously stolen files had been presented. This was always with the aim of increasing the blackmail pressure and increasing the willingness to pay,” the FBI said.Finally, the compromise is then announced by the attackers on a separate leak page and a countdown set until public release of the victim data if no ransom was paid, the FBI added.","Radar/Dispossessor targeted 43 companies, including in India, in sectors such as healthcare and transport.

Pixel 9 Pro Fold: Thinner, taller, and more refined

AI galore

Gemini Live: Your AI assistant gets chatty







Pixel Watch 3: Big and small, smart and fit

Pixel Buds Pro 2: Time for round two

Even though Google was two months early of its usual schedule, it came in with the full bang at its hardware reveal. From Gemini taking centre stage to a slew of new hardware, Google pulled out all the stops at its “Made by Google” showcase. We saw not one, not two, but four new Pixel phones, including a second-gen foldable that has a weird name. And did I mention AI ? It's everywhere, folks.Let's dive into this Pixel wonderland and break down all the details.Google's bringing not one, not two, but three new slab phones to the Pixel party. Four, if we count in the foldable, but let’s save it for later. First up, we've got the base Pixel 9 with a 6.3-inch display, then there’s the Pixel 9 Pro sporting the same 6.3-inch screen. And for those who like 'em big, the Pixel 9 Pro XL is here with a bigger 6.8-inch display.All three phones are rocking a fancy new oval-shaped camera housing that's sure to turn heads – with the base Pixel 9 having a 50MP main and a 48 mp ultrawide; the Pros add on a third 48MP telephoto that can do up to 5x zoom. The sides are flat on all the phones; matt on the vanilla ones, while the Pros have a glossy finish.Under the hood, you'll find Google's updated G4 Tensor chip, promising better battery life and more AI tricks up its sleeve. Oh, and did I mention satellite SOS? Yeah, they've got that too. The new phones come with the usual 7-year promise OS and security updates. Though, these phones run Android 17The Pixel 9 starts at Rs 79,900,. The Pixel 9 Pro will set you back Rs 1,09,999, while the Pro XL starts at a cool Rs 1,24,999. Mark your calendars: the Pixel 9 and 9 Pro XL hit the shelves on August 22nd, with the smaller Pixel 9 Pro following in September.But wait, there's more! Google's not done with foldables, oh no. Enter the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, the sleeker cousin of last year's Pixel Fold . The second iteration is taller and thinner than its predecessor, measuring a svelte 5.1mm when unfolded.The Pixel 9 Pro Fold is packing some serious screen real estate. We're talking a 6.3-inch outer display and a 8-inch inner screen. And get this: that inner display can hit 2,700 nits of brightness. Sunlight? What sunlight?Powered by the same G4 Tensor chip as its slab siblings, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is ready to fold its way into your heart (and wallet) for Rs 1,72,999. It should come to India sometime next month, so you have time to ready your financesIt’s no secret that Google's going all-in on AI with its new Pixel lineup. Gemini, Google's AI assistant, is front and centre, ready to dig through your apps or answer questions about that selfie you just took.Google's serving up two new AI-powered features with the Pixel 9 family. First, there's Pixel Screenshots, which uses on-device AI to let you search through your saved screenshots like a digital detective. Then we've got Pixel Studio , a text-to-image generator that'll have you creating masterpieces with a few taps.And let's not forget about those AI-powered camera tricks. ""Add Me"" lets you photobomb group shots after the fact by stitching two scenes together. Magic Editor in Google Photos is getting an upgrade too, letting you replace entire sections of a photo with AI-generated content. Sky's the limit? Not anymore!As Gemini becomes default on Pixel 9 phones, Google's giving Gemini a voice with Gemini Live. This new voice chat option lets you have a full-on conversation with Google's AI assistant. Choose from 10 different voices and chat away like you're talking to a futuristic friend. You can even interrupt mid-sentence, just like in real life!The Pixel Watch 3 is here, and it's bringing a friend. Alongside the familiar 41mm size, we've got a new 45mm option for those who like their smartwatches like they like their coffee – grande.Both sizes are sporting thinner bezels for more screen real estate, a brighter display hitting 2,000 nits, and a fancy new ultra wideband chip. But the real showstopper? Loss of Pulse Detection. This feature can detect if your pulse stops and call emergency services if you don't respond.The 41mm Pixel Watch 3 starts at Rs 39,999, while the 45mm version will set you back Rs 42,999. Both hit the stores later this year.Last but not least, we've got the Pixel Buds Pro 2. These little audio wonders are smaller, lighter, and packing more punch than ever. With 11-millimetre drivers and a new Tensor A1 chip, they're promising better sound and improved active noise cancellation.Google's added a wing fin design to keep these buds snug during your workouts, and you'll get up to 8 hours of playback with ANC on (or a marathon 30 hours with the case). At Rs 22,900, they're a bit pricier than last year's model. These are also slated to drop sometime later this year.And there you have it, folks! Google's Pixel-palooza was a whirlwind of new hardware, AI features, and enough tech to make even the most jaded gadget lover's head spin. From foldable phones to AI-powered photography, Google's throwing down the gauntlet for the rest of the tech world. The future of Google’s hardware is looking bright, Pixel-y, and very, very smart.","Google unveiled four new Pixel phones, including a second-gen foldable.

"Reliance Jio, Airtel and Vodafone-Idea 'unhappy' with Trai's new QoS rules; say overlook ground realities",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/reliance-jio-airtel-and-vodafone-idea-unhappy-with-trais-new-qos-rules-say-overlook-ground-realities/articleshow/112268723.cms,"COAI statement

COAI’s member Telecom Service Providers (TSPs) have consistently invested in enhancing Quality of Service (QoS) through significant improvements in network infrastructure, resulting in greater stability and reliability. The industry has embraced advanced technologies and automation tools, including predictive maintenance and AI-driven analytics, to proactively address network issues. Moreover, major initiatives are underway to fiberize towers across India, which is a crucial step for the efficient deployment of 5G services.

While TRAI has tightened the QoS benchmarks over the years, the ground realities remain unchanged. TSPs still grapple with Right of Way (RoW) issues when acquiring permissions for infrastructure deployment in public and private land for the installation of cell towers and fiber-optic cables. The situation is further aggravated due to additional requirement of street furniture for the 5G networks. Moreover, interference from various sources, such as other wireless devices and electromagnetic interference, degrade signal quality and network performance. Further, illegal boosters and repeaters used by unauthorised agents, as well as the cases of theft of equipment are also external factors which, nevertheless, impact the QoS. Besides, frequent takedown of the overhead fiber by the authorities have a significant impact in QoS as well. TSPs have limited control over these external sources which adversely impact the Quality of Services.

Despite these challenges, TSPs have consistently met TRAI's QoS benchmarks. The industry expresses concern over the proposed regulations, which not only tighten benchmarks but also shift from quarterly to monthly reporting and site to cell level reporting in many cases. In fact, the QoS parameters prescribed in the new Regulations have not been introduced by any other regulator in other similar economies. These changes are expected to significantly increase the compliance as well as the cost burden on telecom operators, and without commensurate benefits for the customers.

While we are disappointed with the stringency of these new regulations, we remain committed to engaging constructively with TRAI on QoS-related matters. Our member organizations will continue to strive for excellence in service quality while advocating for regulations that recognize the practical challenges faced by our industry.

What are the new QoS rules

The telecom industry has raised concerns over stringent new quality of service (QoS) norms introduced by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India ( TRAI ). The Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), representing major telecom players -- Reliance Jio , Airtel and Vodafone-Idea -- argues that the regulations impose excessive burdens without addressing the challenges operators face on the ground.The new rules mandate stricter service quality benchmarks, increased penalties for non-compliance, and more frequent reporting requirements. Telecom operators must now compensate subscribers for outages exceeding 24 hours at the district level and face penalties of up to Rs 10 lakh for violations.However, COAI contends that these measures are impractical given ongoing hurdles such as right-of-way (RoW) issues for infrastructure deployment, interference from unauthorized devices, and theft of equipment. The industry body also highlights the impact of frequent fiber cuts and the additional demands of 5G network rollout. Despite these challenges, telecom operators have consistently met Trai's QoS benchmarks , according to COAI. The industry is seeking a more realistic approach that acknowledges the operational difficulties and avoids placing undue financial pressure on operators.Trai has issued new quality of service (QoS) rules, making it mandatory for telecom operators to compensate subscribers in case of service outages for more than 24 hours at a district level. Trai has also increased the penal amount to Rs 1 lakh from Rs 50,000 for failing to meet each quality benchmark under the new rules.The telecom regulator has introduced a graded penalty system of Rs 1 lakh, Rs 2 lakh, Rs 5 lakh and Rs 10 lakh for different scales of rule violations and submitting false report under revised regulations -- ""The Standards of Quality of Service of Access (Wirelines and Wireless) and Broadband (Wireline and Wireless) Service Regulations, 2024"".Trai has provided a six-month grace period for operators to align their systems with the new regulations.","The Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), representing major telecom players -- Reliance Jio, Airtel and Vodafone-Idea -- argues that the regulations impose excessive burdens.

Tensor G4, Gemini and more AI inside

Upgraded cameras with the new 'Add me' AI feature for photos

Google has launched its second-generation Pixel foldable phone, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold , which is its first-ever foldable phone in India. The second-gen Pixel Fold upgrades on some salient aspects over the first one. Per Google, the foldable is slim, super durable, and has a brighter screen, both on the outside and inside. And, the phone also packs in Pixel’s “fastest, most powerful” Tensor G4 chip , bringing on-device multimodal capabilities to the phone.On the inside, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold has an 8 inches ‘Super Actua Flex display,’ an LTPO panel with a 2922x1344 resolution at 486 PPI. The inner screen has a dynamic refresh rate of 1-120Hz and can go as bright as 3,000 nits, which Google says is 80% brighter than the screen on the first-gen Pixel Fold. To make use of phone’s large inner canvas, there’s a split-screen mode that’ll let you use two apps side-by-side.When unfolded, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold can be used a regular phone with a 6.3 inches outer screen, which has the same specs as the inner screen.Google says that the Pixel 9 Pro Fold has an “all-new” hinge that is made from stainless steel and has an aerospace grade aluminium alloy cover. The hinge has a polished finish, while the back has the silky matt finish. The phone is rated IPX8 for water resistivity. And there’s Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the outside.Powering the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is Google’s Tensor G4 chip, also found on the other three Pixel 9 phones. The chip comes paired with 16GB of RAM and up to 1TB storage. Then, there’s theTitan M2 security coprocessor , which enables multi-layer hardware security.There’s a 5,060mAh battery, which Google promises will last for over 24 hours and up to 100 hours with Extreme Battery Saver.

The phone also supports Qi wireless charging and Battery Share, i.e., reverse wireless charging.Out-of-the-box the Pixel 9 Pro Fold will come with Android 14 . There’s the usual Google promise of 7 years of OS and security updates.Would it even be a Pixel phone, if there’s no AI in it. Well, there’s a whole lot of AI. For starters Gemini is there, and it works in split-screen mode, as well. One could ask Gemini to write stuff or even get info about whats’s on the screen or photos. Circle To Search is also there, ohh and this feature can help you check if an image has been created using AI.The new “Pixel-exclusive” AI feature to arrive is Pixel Screenshots. The feature could organise or recall things, like events and location, all you need to is ask the phone.Google is giving one year of the Google One AI Premium plan for free to those who’ll buy the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. So, that’ll give you access to Gemini Advanced, Gemini in Gmail and Docs, on top of 2TB of cloud storage.The Pixel 9 Pro Fold ditches the camera visor for a squircle module that houses a triple lens setup – a 50MP wide camera, a 48MP ultraide and a 48MP 5x telephoto camera. For selfies, there's a 42 MP front-facing camera on the inner screen and 10MP camera on the outside.The camera hardware has been only a part of Pixel’s camera, but it’s AI that completes it. There’s a long list of AI features that complements the camera hardware on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. The usual Super Res Zoom, Zoom Enhance, Video Boost, Face Unblur, Photo Unblur, Best Take, Magic Eraser, Audio Eraser, and Magic Editor makes their return. Well, Magic Eraser now has an a “reimagine” feature that Google says can give photos a “whole new look.”One new AI tool to come to Google’s Pixel 9 pro Fold is the “Add Me,” which as you’d image can add you to a picture. So, how does it work? Well, you take photo with the group, swap in yourself, and AI will merge the photos.Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold is priced in India at Rs 1,72,999 and will be available for purchase later this year. While it comes in two colours – Obsidian and Porcelain – it’ll be available only in Obsidian colour in India.","Google has launched its second-generation Pixel foldable phone, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold.

Delta Airlines seeks compensation for disruption

In mounting problems for CrowdStrike over Microsoft outage last month, the cybersecurity company being sued by air travellers in a latest move. According to a Reuters report, air travellers whose flights were delayed or cancelled on July 19 due to Microsoft Windows outage on July 19 have filed a class action against the company.The plaintiffs include three fliers who filed the lawsuit in the federal court, Austin, Texas.They blame CrowdStrike's negligence in testing and deploying its software for the outage. Adding further, they stated that as fliers scrambled to get to their destinations, many spent hundreds of dollars on lodging, meals and alternative travel, while others missed work or suffered health problems from having to sleep on the airport floor.The filers demand CrowdStrike to pay compensatory and punitive damages to anyone whose flight was disrupted.In a statement, CrowdStrike said ""We believe this case lacks merit and we will vigorously defend the company."" The US cybersecurity company also provided an identical statement in response to a shareholder lawsuit filed on July 31.Delta claims that it faced over 2,200 flight cancellations on July 19 alone, with more than 6,000 flights cancelled since then. The airline is now dealing with over 176,000 refund or reimbursement requests. The estimated cost of the outages could reach as high as $500 million.The company’s CEO Ed Bastian said last week the outage had cost the airline $500 million, adding that it plans to take legal action to get compensation from the cybersecurity firm.Microsoft outage on July 19 was caused by a faulty software update that impacted 8 million Windows computers worldwide. CrowdStrike has rejected Delta Airlines' claim stating that it is ""highly disappointed by Delta's suggestion that CrowdStrike acted inappropriately and strongly rejects any allegation that it was grossly negligent or committed misconduct.""","Air travellers whose flights were delayed or cancelled on July 19 have filed a class action against CrowdStrike.

"Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange, gets Rs 722 crore GST from DGGI",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/dgci-sends-rs-722-crore-gst-notice-to-the-worlds-largest-crypto-exchange-binance/articleshow/112304561.cms,"In a groundbreaking move, the Ahmedabad zonal unit of the Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGGI) has issued a show cause notice to Binance , the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange , demanding Goods and Services Tax (GST) payment of Rs 722 crore. This marks the first time the DGGI has issued such a notice to a cryptocurrency firm, setting a significant precedent in India’s efforts to regulate the rapidly growing virtual currency market.Sources confirmed that the notice was issued to Binance for collecting fees from Indian customers trading in virtual digital assets (VDAs) on their platform, categorized under online information database access or retrieval (OIDAR) services.Earlier this year, Binance received approval from India’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) to register as a virtual asset service provider (VASP). However, the company was slapped with a Rs 18 crore penalty from the FIU last month for non-compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) regulations.Despite being a major player in the global cryptocurrency market, with at least 40% market share and operations across more than 150 countries, Binance had not registered under the Indian GST framework. This oversight has now brought the company under the scrutiny of Indian tax authorities.“Binance reportedly earned at least Rs 4,000 crore from transaction fees charged to Indian customers. The company has a user base of 90 million users globally, including a substantial number of customers from India too. Detailed investigation revealed that the earnings of these fees were credited to the account of a Binance Group Company — Nest Services Limited — based in Seychelles,” a top source privy to the development said.In fact, Binance is reportedly facing a trial in a Nigerian court for alleged tax evasion, following a crypto crackdown in the country.To make Binance compliant with the GST regulations, DGGI Ahmedabad zonal unit also sent emails to Binance group companies in Seychelles, the Cayman Islands and Switzerland, which did not elicit a response. Binance appointed a local counsel in India to liaise with the DGGI, marking the first step towards resolving this significant tax compliance issue.Sources confirmed that DGGI is also closely monitoring financial transactions and activities of online gaming platforms and marketplaces for the possibility of tax evasion.The Indian GST regime mandates that foreign service providers pay GST for services provided to Indian residents, particularly under the OIDAR category. As the investigation continues, other cryptocurrency exchanges operating both overseas and within India are also expected to face scrutiny from tax authorities, said sources.","The Ahmedabad zonal unit of the Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGGI) has issued a show cause notice to Binance.

The new offering promises lightning-fast 8-16 minute deliveries for a diverse range of products, spanning from groceries to electronics.With this move, Flipkart directly challenges established players in the booming quick commerce sector, including Swiggy's Instamart, Zomato's Blinkit , Zepto , and BigBasket's BB Now.The service, which was previously offered on a trial basis to employees at Flipkart's headquarters, is now available to users through the Flipkart app.We confirmed the service's availability by checking an address in HSR on the Flipkart app, which indeed showed Flipkart Minutes as an option for quick delivery. Additionally, several users on X (formerly Twitter) reported that Flipkart is delivering groceries and other items to their addresses in Bengaluru within minutes through the ""Minutes"" service.Sources familiar with the matter tell the Economic Times that Flipkart plans to expand the service to more areas in Bengaluru over the next few weeks.The launch of Flipkart Minutes comes at a time when other players in the quick commerce space are aggressively expanding their operations.The ET had earlier reported that Flipkart was planning to operate around 100 dark stores to bolster its quick-commerce offerings during the upcoming festive season. Dark stores, which are mini warehouses strategically located for rapid deliveries, have become a crucial component of quick commerce operations.Blinkit, for instance, recently announced ambitious plans to increase its dark store count to 2,000 by 2026. This doubles down on its earlier announced plans to have 1,000 dark stores by March 2025. Similarly, Zepto aims to double its network to 700 dark stores by March 2025. Swiggy Instamart , another major player, currently operates more than 500 such warehouses.Interestingly, Amazon, a key player in the e-commerce space, has not shown interest in the quick-commerce business in India so far. However, it does operate a grocery store service dubbed "" Amazon Fresh ,"" offering same-day delivery for groceries. This is similar to what Flipkart has also been offering through its Grocery tab.","Flipkart has launched its quick commerce service'Flipkart Minutes'in select areas of Bengaluru.

California man credits Apple Watch for saving his life: ‘I wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for this little device’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/california-man-credits-apple-watch-for-saving-his-life-i-wouldnt-be-here-if-it-wasnt-for-this-little-device/articleshow/112306053.cms,"Apple Watch detects user’s low heart rate



What doctor said

An Apple Watch user is crediting the smartwatch for saving his life after the wearable alerted him about a life-threatening condition. Peter Moore , a resident of Montecito, California shared his experience with a local news publisher KTLA. Narrating the incident, he said “I wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for this little device”.Moore, who is a former tech executive, said that he was on his way to the airport when he began to feel “a little lightheaded and a little faint”.“Like a typical male, I thought, ‘I’ll go to Starbucks. That’ll fix it,'” Moore explained before he received a notification from the Apple Watch he was wearing.“My phone started to ping and said ‘low heart rate,’ which I’d never seen before. And so I looked at it… my heart rate had dropped to 32. And it was insistent in its notifications that something wasn’t right,” said Moore. He then contacted his wife who took him to hospital.“The doctor kind of theatrically ran in and said, ‘This is not good. This is not good. You need a pacemaker right now,'” Moore said.Omid Yousefian, the cardiac electrophysiologist at Sansum Clinic Cardiology who treated Moore said “Yes, his watch had a big role in saving his life”.“These days, 25% of the population over the age of 40 … have a high chance of experiencing atrial fibrillation,” Yousefian explained.“For us physicians, symptoms are the most important thing. [Moore] was notified by his watch that his heart rate is slow and he correlated that with the symptoms that he had. So he didn’t wait. He didn’t sit. He came to the hospital directly. So he made a very smart move,” Yousefian told the publication.","Peter Moore, a former tech executive, was on his way to the airport when he began to feel “a little lightheaded and a little faint” He received a notification from the Apple Watch he was wearing that his heart rate had dropped to 32.

What exactly happened

Read the complete post here

In a shocking incident, a Supreme Court lawyer, Mukul P Unny , was scammed out of Rs 38,000 while attempting to exchange his iPhone 13 for an iPhone 15 on Amazon .in. The lawyer detailed his ordeal on social media, highlighting the fraudulent tactics employed by the delivery executive.Unny took X (formerly known as Twitter) to post about the new kind of smartphone exchange scam.The incident occurred on July 21, 2024, when Unny placed an order for the iPhone 15 on Amazon. The following day, a delivery executive arrived at his residence and handed over the new phone after receiving the necessary OTP. However, the executive then requested another OTP, claiming it was required to complete the exchange.Despite Unny's hesitation, he was convinced to return the new iPhone to the delivery executive after speaking to the latter's supervisor.Unny contacted Amazon customer care the following day to report the incident. Initially, Amazon assured him of a refund if the product was not delivered. However, subsequent inquiries revealed the case was under investigation with a resolution deadline of July 31.On July 31st, Amazon concluded its investigation and informed Unny that a refund was impossible. The company's explanation lacked substance, as they had not thoroughly verified the scam details. The fact that Unny still possessed his old iPhone directly contradicted Amazon's claim that the exchange was complete.While Amazon has eventually issued a refund to Unny, his ordeal underscores the considerable risks inherent in online transactions, even when dealing with reputable platforms like Amazon.Always verify the identity of a delivery executive before sharing your Amazon OTP. This crucial step can protect you from falling victim to scams.“This is the story of my worst experience with @amazonIN On 21.07.2024, I ordered iPhone 15 from Amazon in exchange for my iPhone 13. On 22.07.2024, the delivery executive came at around 930 PM. I gave the OTP and took the product, and gave my phone to the executive.He said I have give another OTP. I had already given the OTP and was wondering what other OTP is to be given for exchange. I said I dont have any other OTP than the one I have given. He stayed there for few minutes & then called his supervisor.After speaking with the supervisor, the delivery exec asked for return of the product since the ""exchange is not final"".I insisted that I speak with the supervisor. The supervisor tells me that the exchange is done by a different team & requests for the product to be returned. I said I cannot give away the product especially since the OTP is given and the app was showing that the product is delivered. But this supervisor Ashok (8076650306) requested me to return, lest his team will have to make for the loss.Upon his request and assurance that the product will be ""reattempted"" the next day, I gave the product to the delivery exec (Vishal 8826421956) after taking the supervisor's and the delivery exec's number. On 23.07.2024, I spoke with the Amazon Customer Care and raised a complaint to which I assured that refund will be initiated if the product is not delivered. Call centre asked me to follow up on 25.07.2024.On 26.07.2024,when I called them, the customer case asked me to wait till 31.05.2024 as ""it has to be investigated"". Today, when I call Amazon, they said ""investigation"" is complete and that refund cannot be initiated. No fact-finding was done by Amazon in this. Now, we are staring at a loss of Rs. 38000 and a possible scam done by supervisor, delivery exec and others at Amazon. If they say that the exchange is done, then they can very well see the old phone that I still use with me.This could happen to any one of you and please be aware while dealing with @amazonIN.”","Supreme Court lawyer Mukul P Unny was scammed out of Rs 38,000 while attempting to exchange his iPhone 13 for an iPhone 15 on Amazon.in.
