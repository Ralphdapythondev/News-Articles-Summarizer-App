"Income Tax Expectations Budget 2024: What can the salaried, individual taxpayers expect? Top points",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/income-tax-expectations-budget-2024-what-can-the-salaried-individual-taxpayers-expect-top-points/articleshow/111827692.cms,"By Surabhi Marwah

Increase in the basic exemption limit under the new tax regime – One key change expected from the upcoming budget is the increase in the basic exemption limit from Rs 3,00,000 to Rs 5,00,000.

Reduction in tax rates under new tax regime – It is expected to have reduced tax rates / rejig in tax slabs under the new tax regime.

Increase in standard deduction – It is expected that the standard deduction is increased from Rs 50,000 to Rs 1,00,000 as this limit has remained the same for the last 5 years.

Increase in deduction for interest on housing loan for self-occupied house property – It is expected that the limit for deduction towards interest on housing loan for self-occupied house property will be increased from Rs 2,00,000 to Rs 3,00,000. This may also help promote home ownership and help the government in its mission of ‘Housing for All’.

Overhaul of the capital gains tax structure – Currently there are various tax rates and holding periods for different types of instruments and also the indexation benefit differs in different situations for the purpose of computation of capital gains tax. It is expected that the government may bring about some amendments such as changes in tax rates, method of computation, period of holding etc. to have a more unified and simplified capital gains tax regime. One specific wish from a capital gains taxation standpoint would be the increase in the tax-free ceiling limit on long-term capital gains from sale of equity shares (listed) / equity oriented mutual funds from Rs 1,00,000 to Rs 2,00,000.

Budget 2024 income tax expectations : The government is set to table its first full budget after elections and the wish list of taxpayers is as long as ever. This is especially so as the government did not make any key changes in the interim budget as it was a Vote on Account budget. Over the years, the government has been taking steps to make the concessional tax regime or the new tax regime more attractive for individual taxpayers.Few changes which were introduced in the last year’s budget i.e., Budget 2023 were:a) Increase in the basic exemption limit to Rs 3,00,000 from Rs 2,50,000b) Capping of maximum surcharge at 25%c) Introduction of standard deduction of Rs 50,000d) Rejig of the tax slabs.Keeping in view the government’s intent to simplify/ rationalise tax laws and enhance compliance, one may expect a few changes in the upcoming Union Budget 2024 to make the new income tax regime more attractive.Also Read | Budget 2024 income tax expectations: Why 50% HRA exemption should include cities like Bengaluru, Hyderabad At present, for individuals with gross income above Rs 15,50,000, if their total deductions and exemptions exceed Rs 3,75,000* (excluding standard deduction), the old regime is more beneficial as compared to the new one.Further, the increased cost of housing and increased awareness towards various investment instruments has led to higher claim of HRA exemptions and higher investment-based deductions (eligible under sections 80C, 80D of the Income-tax Act, interest on housing loan for self-occupied house property etc.) among salaried taxpayers and in many cases such limit of Rs 3,75,000 is easily breached resulting in taxpayers opting for existing / old tax regime.Therefore, in order to make the new tax regime more attractive and to keep up with the government’s intent of having a unified tax regime with fewer deductions / exemptions, one may expect few changes in the new regime as below:*This limit is for deductions and exemptions not available under the new tax regimeAlso Read | Income Tax expectations Budget 2024: Tax exempt limit for savings account interest to be raised to Rs 25,000?

The company's results followed positive performances from its larger competitors, Tata Consultancy Services and HCLTech, raising optimism for the $254 billion sector, which has been grappling with slow demand following a post-pandemic surge.In recent quarters, IT clients have reduced their spending on non-essential projects due to economic uncertainty and higher interest rates. However, analysts anticipate a change in this trend once the US Federal Reserve lowers interest rates and the outcome of the country's election is determined.","Infosys announced its financial results for the first quarter of the fiscal year 2024-25 on Thursday.

Banks offer special FD rates to attract deposits: In an effort to attract retail deposits, banks have launched special schemes offering savers an additional 25-30 basis points for term deposits above current commitments for similar tenures. This move suggests that policy interest rates are likely to remain high in the near future.According to an ET report, several major banks, including SBI , Bank of Baroda , Indian Overseas Bank , Union Bank of India , and Bank of Maharashtra, have introduced deposit plans with interest rates ranging from 7.25% to 7.30% for investments spanning 399 to 444 days.Senior citizens are eligible for an extra 50 basis points on these rates.For example, SBI's Amrit Vrishti scheme provides an interest rate of 7.25% for deposits with a tenure of 444 days. Similarly, Bank of Baroda's Monsoon Dhamaka plan offers the same rate of 7.25% for deposits spanning 399 days.Indian Overseas Bank has set its interest rate at 7.30% for deposits lasting 444 days. Bank of Maharashtra, on the other hand, is offering 6.90% for deposits with a duration of 200 days and 7.10% for those extending to 400 days.Lenders are struggling to raise retail deposits and have therefore introduced limited-period schemes, according to a treasury head from a commercial bank. Bankers believe that if credit growth continues at 14-16%, they will need to offer more attractive interest rates to mobilize deposits.Also Read | ITR filing FY 2023-24: What is the penalty for late filing of income tax return? Check penalties for misreporting tax & other mistakes The decision to increase deposit rates follows a recent interaction between the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and bank CEOs, where the regulator instructed banks to close the gap between deposit and credit growth. As of June 28, bank credit had risen by 14% year-on-year, while deposits had only increased by 11%.Industry experts believe that banks are offering these peak rates on shorter tenures because they anticipate the rate cycle, which was previously expected to shift in the latter half of this calendar year, will eventually start to reverse as inflation remains consistently within the central bank's legally mandated limits.Anil Gupta, senior vice president of the financial sector at ICRA Ratings, said, ""Banks are offering higher rates for less than two years tenure. So when the interest rate cycle turns, banks would not want to be stuck with high-cost liabilities.""However, RBI governor Shaktikanta Das recently indicated that rates would remain elevated for some time, saying, ""The overall economic environment globally and in India is so uncertain... I think it is too early to talk about an interest rate cut.""",Banks have launched special schemes offering savers an additional 25-30 basis points for term deposits.

Govt holds 45.5% in the erstwhile development financial institution that became a bank, with LIC being the largest shareholder with over 49% stake.The plan envisages the sale of 60.7% in the bank, including govt’s 30.5% and LIC’s 30.2%. Based on the current market cap of almost Rs 95,000 crore, the Centre can hope to realise almost Rs 29,000 crore from the disinvestment, although several observers have said that the terms of the transaction are not very attractive.While the Modi govt had lined up an ambitious privatisation agenda, including public sector companies such as BPCL, Concor, BEML, Shipping Corporation, IDBI Bank, state-run lenders and an insurance company, it has failed to report any progress with a virtual freeze on the exercise for the last 18 months as the general elections were due.While there were expectations that things will move post-polls, but the verdict has put a question mark over the fate of disinvestment, especially with petroleum minister Hardeep Puri recently stating that BPCL privatisation has been shelved.Modi govt stance on privatisation is eagerly awaited, given that this time it is dependent on coalition partners and the Budget is likely to provide cues.Given the recent rise in PSU stocks, the govt can hope to meet its disinvestment target of Rs 50,000 crore during the current financial year.While the govt has repeatedly spoken about getting out of sectors that are “non-strategic”, in the last 10 years, it only has the Air India disinvestment to count as a success.Market observers see IDBI Bank as an easier entity to divest, given that it is a private lender for all practical purposes with govt stake rising due to massive capital infusion to help the bank deal with bad debt-driven losses.","RBI has given its report on all but one bidder, a foreign player, which did not share information.

Banks: Banks adapt to changing customer behavior amid low interest rates,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/banks-adapt-to-changing-customer-behavior-amid-low-interest-rates/articleshow/111910821.cms,"Mumbai: As inflation bites into savings and banks remain adamant about not raising interest rates on savings deposits , customers are transforming from savers to investors . This has caused banks to reevaluate their strategies.“The saver-to-investor movement is quite accentuated, and it has only galloped after the elections. That is why you are seeing pressure on savings accounts where funds are going into mutual funds, SIPs or even term deposits,” said Shanti Ekambaram, deputy MD, Kotak Bank.Since March 2020, the share of deposits in savings accounts has dropped to 31.2% from 32.8%, while the number for current account has remained unchanged at around 9.5%.The share of term deposits has risen to 59% from 57.8%. Adjusted for inflation (5%), most savings accounts are yielding negative returns, but none of the banks are looking at hiking rates.Ashok Vaswani, MD & CEO of Kotak Bank, in an analyst call said the bank sees itself as the holding company for other businesses, generating value from money that moves from the bank to capital markets or insurance.To grow the deposit base, the bank aims to strengthen its franchise by making savings accounts easier to open and bundling offers for key segments. It relaunched a programme that sweeps money from savings and current to term deposits and has introduced a micro-market strategy to grow the deposit base.HDFC Bank’s strategy is to significantly grow its branch network and customer base while fostering deeper connections with existing customers. The bank’s focus is now on granular retail deposits, which are the individual balances retained in customer accounts.“We want the branches to drive granular deposit growth and not look for non-retail or large ticket-sized deposits” said Srinivasan Vaidyanathan, CFO, HDFC Bank. He added that the ‘star’ in resources mobilisation was fixed deposits which have grown by Rs 44,300 crore or 24% over the previous year.Yes Bank has added 140 branches since Jan last year. This year, it plans to add 30-50 branches. Rajan Pental, head of retail at the bank, said that there has been a marginal uptick on the cost of new deposits, but it does not move the needle.“The customer needs money for transactions, investment, for spending which has to come through the banking channel, which we are in a position to augment and make them do transactions through RBL Bank with our differentiated service and interest rate,” said R Subramaniakumar, MD & CEO, RBL Bank.","Since March 2020, the share of deposits in savings accounts has dropped to 31.2% from 32.8%.

7th Budget: Striking a balance key challenge for Sitharaman,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/7th-budget-striking-a-balance-key-challenge-for-sitharaman/articleshow/111912750.cms,"NEW DELHI: Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman 's seventh Budget will do a tight rope walk as she looks to strike a balance between the need to spend more on social sector schemes amid calls from allies for additional assistance to states, while seeking to address demands for a reduction in personal income tax and yet ensuring that she sticks to the fiscal glide path .Much of the discussion has focused on RBI's higher dividend of over Rs 2 lakh crore coming to govt's aid, but the additional money has already been used for the solar rooftop scheme.Sitharaman will need more funds to roll out PM Narendra Modi's other pre-poll announcement of a new housing subsidy scheme for the poor, while honouring poll promises such as increasing the coverage of Aayushman Bharat to include seniors. There are already demands to enhance the insurance cover to Rs 10 lakh, which requires a political call given that there are complaints of hospitals coming up just to cater to this segment of population.Her Budget arithmetic will be based on revenue, tax revenue and capital receipts (disinvestment) collections being higher than what she had budgeted for in the interim Budget, which was bereft of any announcements.Since then the political situation has changed with BJP now dependent on allies to run govt at the Centre although it still has 240 MPs in the Lok Sabha. But the noise of lack of jobs, persistent weakness in private investment, income disparity and regional imbalance has grown, generating expectations of issues being addressed in the Budget with youth, women and farmers being major thrust areas.For a govt that has so far stayed away from freebies or revdis, checking leakages from schemes has been a key priority -- be it tax breaks or benefits under schemes. While that will remain leitmotif, Sitharaman may be constricted to lower the fiscal deficit significantly below the budgeted 5.1% of GDP due to higher expenditure requirements, especially as she presents the first Budget of Modi 3.0, laying out the road map for the period up to 2030, with 2047 being the ultimate target.There have been demands for employment-linked incentives from some industry groups, but the focus of govt is on production linked sops, where incremental output and investments in creating capacity, which in turn generates employment, has remained the focus. Sitharaman is expected to once again count on the private sector to create jobs through higher investment in creating and adding to capacity.Overall growth and the sentiment on India has been positive but the focus may be on addressing the requirements of sectors that need hand holding.",Sitharaman will need more funds to roll out PM Narendra Modi's other pre-poll announcement of a new housing subsidy scheme for the poor.

How govt can reduce cos' compliance burden,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/how-govt-can-reduce-cos-compliance-burden/articleshow/111913254.cms,"Tax policy and administration play a pivotal role in shaping the economic landscape of a country. For corporates around the world, the competitiveness of local laws and the associated compliance costs are crucial factors when deciding on investment destinations. These costs include the time and resources dedicated to adhering to tax laws , maintaining records, filing returns, and liaising with tax authorities.It is incumbent upon govts to ensure that tax laws and compliances are fair, equitable, and streamlined, so that they do not hinder business operations. In India, the tax system has historically been complex, characterised by large number of indirect and direct taxes levied by various levels of govts. Recognising this, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) and the Goods and Services Tax Network (GSTN) have been diligently working to enhance user experience and simplify the compliance process.The introduction of the GST in 2017 marked a significant overhaul of the Indian tax compliance landscape, complemented by various digitisation efforts. Yet, the GST law requires monthly and annual returns, plus a yearly reconciliation statement for each state, leading to 14 returns per state each year. For entities operating across multiple states, compliance becomes a substantial investment of time and effort.As a result of digitisation, the GST and income tax systems are also being linked and there is seamless flow of data among various departments of govt. However, the tax policy makers have regularly expanded the scope of tax deducted at source (TDS) and tax collection at source (TCS) provisions, over the past few years. This has increased the TDS compliance and reporting burden of corporate India. For example, recent years have seen the introduction of TDS on transactions such as purchase of goods, cash withdrawals from the bank, and benefits or perquisites provided in the course of business. TCS has also been applied to overseas remittances, tour package sales, and sale of goods. These provisions, with their different thresholds and rates, are challenging for corporates to comply with.Add to these the growing disclosure requirements in corporate tax return forms and tax audit reports and one is looking at a heavy compliance burden .As India continues to refine its tax infrastructure, it is essential to monitor global trends and adopt best practices. One such measure could be introducing thresholds for presumptive taxation to alleviate compliance costs. For example, the UAE exempts corporate tax on profits up to AED 375,000. It also offers ""small business relief"" for companies with revenues up to AED 30,000,000, exempting them from corporate tax and transfer pricing documentation requirements, thus reducing the compliance burden for small taxpayers.Continued reforms and technological investments are crucial for further reducing the compliance burden. The multiple TDS/TCS provisions can be reduced as also the reporting requirements in corporate tax returns and tax audit reports. With seamless data exchange among govt departments, tax filings can also be streamlined by removing disclosures where the data can be obtained from other sources.Further, a consultative approach involving stakeholders in the design and scrutiny of proposed measures can help reduce some of the pain. Proactive communication of the intent behind tax policy measures and issuing clear and fair guidance on new provisions will provide certainty to taxpayers and decrease disputes.(The writer is tax director, EY India; Aviral Godha, senior tax professional with EY has also contributed to this article.

India's exports increase by 2.56% to $35.2 billion in June, imports reach $56.18 billion

India's merchandise exports increase to $35.2 billion in June, while imports rise to $56.18 billion. Trade deficit stands at $20.98 billion. Commerce secretary projects total exports may exceed $800 billion for the fiscal year.

NEW DELHI: Issues like complex procedures of DGFT and customs , import restrictions and domestic vested interests are holding up the export growth of the Indian garment sector, think tank Global Trade Research Initiative said on Sunday. At the root of the exporters’ problem is difficulty in obtaining quality raw fabric, particularly synthetic fabric, the GTRI said.“High import duties on fabrics, intricate procedures, force exporters to meticulously account for every inch and type of fabric imported,” GTRI founder Ajay Srivastava said.Agencies","India's merchandise exports increase to $35.2 billion in June, while imports rise to $56.18 billion.

Railway Budget 2024: Improving passenger experience, speed of trains

Railway Budget 2024: What else needs to be done?

Railway Budget 2024 : Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present the Union Budget 2024 on July 23, 2024 and the government is expected to continue with its capital expenditure push for infrastructure, with Indian Railways and the roadways being major beneficiaries. Since 2017, no separate Railway Budget has been presented and FM Sitharaman’s Budget 2024 speech will be looked at for the future plans for Indian Railways.In the Interim Budget 2024, the Modi government had allocated a record Rs 2,52,000 crore for capital expenditure for Indian Railways in FY 2024-25.Experts believe that a record capex push for railways is a foregone conclusion, but what’s of paramount importance is the projects on which this capital expenditure is made.Also Check | Budget 2024 Expectations Live Updates: Income Tax changes, record capex for roads and railways expected from FM Nirmala Sitharaman All experts unanimously agree that the capital expenditure allocation for Indian Railways should focus on augmenting safety on the network, especially implementation of the Kavach anti-collision system .Sudhanshu Mani, the creator of Train 18 or Vande Bharat says, “Most importantly, there is a need to provide a fillip to safety, with faster implementation of Kavach and use of artificial intelligence for safety audits.”G Raghuram, Professor Emeritus at Gujarat Maritime University, and a railway expert tells TOI, “The budget 2024-25 for the railway sector needs to give a high priority for safety, followed by capacity augmentation.”“Be it Kavach, maintenance of rolling stock, tracks and signals, training of key operating manpower, use of data analytics and studies to identify contexts that are vulnerable to safety, black boxes and camera installations in trains, quicker response equipment for post accident support,” he elaborates.Manish Sharma, Partner and Leader, Infrastructure, Transport and Logistics, PwC India is of the view that the increased capex and its accelerated implementation will be needed for upgradation of safety measures such as Kavach and advanced signalling, and the budget should have a special allocation for this pressing need.Also Read | Cheer for common man! Indian Railways to manufacture almost 10,000 non-AC coaches in 2 years to meet growing demand Moving beyond the introduction of the Vande Bharat class of trains, railway experts advocate focus on non air-conditioned passenger travel.Shri Prakash, Retired Railway Board Member says that apart from the Vande Bharat type trains that serve a particular market niche, the government should make massive investments for procurement of general service coaches, sitting as well as sleeper coaches for long and middle distance segments to control the heavy overcrowding. The demand is much more than the supply, he says.“⁠The government should equally give emphasis on introduction of short distance branch line passenger trains, their shortages are massive on almost all over the country,” he tells TOI.Manish Sharma of PwC says that besides capex, enhancing customer experience is important through improved facilities, cleanliness, seat availability and even dynamic pricing models.“Besides Vande Bharat trains , the launch of non-AC passenger trains featuring push-pull technology is needed under the Amrit Bharat Scheme, to address larger public transportation needs,” he adds.Sudhanshu Mani notes that it is important that one starts seeing tangible benefits of this expenditure - in terms of better revenue, more freight being carried and faster passenger trains. “The much-delayed big ticket projects like J&K rail line, DFC and high-speed rail project need to be expedited. Finally, upgradation of tracks for higher speeds of trains is also important,” he tells TOI.Also Check | Top Luxury Train In India! Jaw Dropping Pics of Maharajas' Express - Most Expensive Train by IRCTC Shri Prakash says that for freight revenue to improve, ⁠Indian Railways has to aggressively increase its commodity basket entering into non-bulk traffic market.Shri Prakash pitches for an increase in railway fares. “⁠The government should increase passenger fares at par with bus fares to cut down the losses. For this passenger fares that are uniformly applicable throughout the country should be decentralised empowering zonal administration to fix fares according to market conditions,” he advises.Manish Sharma says that the Budget should continue to support and enhance capital expenditure in modernisation of Indian Railways. “The acceleration of capex for capacity augmentation is very critical for railways as it will enable them to employ a host of new strategies and interventions to drive modal shift, and stay competitive against other modes of transport for attracting freight and passenger traffic,” he tells TOI.Lastly, railways need to signal a stringent intent to attract PPP, not just to mobilise extra-budgetary resources but also to leverage private sector efficiency in delivery of services, Sharma says. “Besides conventional PPP concessions, models like asset recycling, and where suitable instruments like InvITs should be explored to attract different categories of private sector participants,” he adds.G Raghuram says, “Towards capacity, investments to streamline traffic flows are important. Rolling stock investments need to be made keeping in mind export opportunities. There is a need for better focus on research and development involving academic institutions.”","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present the Union Budget 2024 on July 23, 2024.

Budget 2024 income tax expectations : Over the recent few years, the government has taken various steps to improve the taxpayer’s experience by allowing various functionalities online. Certain Forms such as the Annual Information Statement (AIS) /Taxpayer Information Summary (TIS), have been introduced which provide a comprehensive view of a taxpayer’s income and other financial information for the year.The aim is to encourage voluntary compliance, reduce non-compliance, and make it easier to pre-fill tax returns. Some of these measures are now bearing fruit for the government in terms of increased filing of tax returns by taxpayers and in improved tax collections.Following are some specific challenge areas where further streamlining by authorities could enhance taxpayer filing experience.There are various Income Tax Return (ITR) Forms tailored for different taxpayer scenarios. Selecting the appropriate tax return filing Form is important to ensure better compliance. Currently, the choice of the relevant Form is left to the taxpayer. It may be good to introduce a feature of recommending the relevant tax return Form based on specific questions posed in the portal. For instance, questions around residential status, types of income earned, whether the individual has income / assets overseas etc., could be posed, based on which the relevant tax return Form could be recommended for consideration of the taxpayer.Also Check | Budget 2024 Expectations Live Updates: Income Tax changes, record capex for roads and railways expected from FM Nirmala Sitharaman Currently, the income tax department has transactional information of taxpayers linked with PAN in their database, through AIS and TIS. While TIS is the simplified statement of the information presently available with the Income Tax Department, Form AIS is a detailed statement capturing quarterly information on e-TDS, tax payment records, etc. For a taxpayer to verify and reconcile two statements may be burdensome. Consolidating and simplifying the information into one document will ease the burden of the taxpayer.The Government through Form AIS/TIS has made efforts to capture most of the income source and financial information of taxpayers. Details such as salary income, interest and dividend incomes and related taxes deducted/collected at source, are now automatically pre-populated in the ITR Forms. While financial information (buy/sell of shares/mutual funds etc) gets captured in the AIS Form, the related gain/loss does not automatically flow into the ITR Form, unlike salary and other income and hence a manual intervention is required.One of the reasons could be that the calculation of gain/loss from sale of such assets is complicated due to varied types of gain/loss and the tax rates associated with the same. While filing the tax return, the taxpayer has to categorise the capital gains under various sections such as 111A, 112A etc, which many taxpayers may not be aware of. Further, categorisation of capital gains into long term and short term depends on the period of holding, which varies depending on the nature of the asset. Streamlining the capital gain tax regime, simplifying the definition of what constitutes long term and short-term capital gains etc., could go a long way in enhancing ease of compliance.In specific taxpayer cases along with filing of income tax return, it is also required to file the other related Forms as prescribed under the tax laws. For example, a taxpayer claiming credit for taxes paid outside India will have to file Form 67, a non-resident taxpayer claiming relief under the DTAA between India and an overseas country needs to file Form 10F etc. It is difficult for a taxpayer to track or identify the relevant Forms and this, hence leads to non-compliance. It is user friendly to have the tax return filing utilities embedded with features to fill and file the Forms electronically based on the draft return of income filled. This helps in proactively ensuring compliance part from the taxpayer.Another suggestion is with respect to carry forward of information relating to unclaimed taxes withheld at source. Similar to the manner that the carry forward of losses information is captured and pre-filled, based on prior year returns filed, capturing information of unclaimed TDS to future years will ease the filing process and record keeping.Currently, the Income Tax Forms have a provision for NRIs who have no Indian bank account, to mention a foreign bank account for refund. However, in practice the refund is not credited to an account held overseas. Suitable arrangements to facilitate the above would enhance taxpayer experience.It is noteworthy to appreciate the changes/features introduced in recent times by authorities enabling ease of tax return filing for the taxpayer. However continued focus on enhancing taxpayer experience and mitigating some of the specific challenges mentioned above, would definitely be helpful.","Government has taken various steps to improve the taxpayer’s experience by allowing various functionalities online.

Budget 2024 pharmaceutical industry expectations: As India awaits the Union Budget 2024 and announcements that will propel the country towards becoming ‘Viksit Bharat’ by 2047, the pharmaceutical industry is also looking forward to fiscal policies and allocations that will make it a US$130 billion-industry by 2030 and US$450 billion by 2047.While the Interim Budget 2024 focused on a healthier future, increasing allocations for Ayushman Bharat (PMAB-Health Infrastructure Mission and the PM Jan Arogya Yojana), it is imperative that higher allocations towards public health continue. The National Health Policy 2017 had recommended the target of 2.5% of GDP by 2025.The industry, therefore, has some key expectations from the Union Budget 2024, which will provide further impetus to this sunrise sector and contribute to the nation’s future.Also Check | Budget 2024 Expectations Live Updates: Income Tax changes, record capex for roads and railways expected from FM Nirmala Sitharaman Innovation is key if India is to continue being the world’s pharmacy as also to meet our domestic needs. As per the Department of Pharmaceuticals, 62research papers have been published in May 2024, which clearly indicates India’s potential in R&D. However, R&D not only requires great intellectual prowess but also substantial financial investment.The Indian pharma industry spends about 8.4% of total sales value on R&D against 11%-12% globally, according to a Parliamentary Standing Committee on Commerce. To lower the financial barriers to investing in R&D, in addition to increasing the budget allocation towards R&D, a tax holiday can be provided and weighted tax deduction on R&D expenditure can be restored.At present, 32 approvals are needed to commercialize an emerging product. Simplifying the process of regulatory approvals will reduce the time to market and enhance the industry’s competitiveness.The existing Patent Box Regime (PBR) promotes innovation as the resident inventor gets tax concessions on royalty income at the rate of 10% plus surcharge and cess as applicable. However, amending some of its provisions will maintain a fair and sustainable tax system. There is a need to specifically include patents developed in India and registered in a foreign country for PBR benefits. For instance, PBR benefits on royalty attributable to patents developed in India but registered in the US or registered in both the countries.Similarly, clarification is needed for the term 'Eligible Assessee’ to include a patentee/inventor who is resident in India and controls R&D activity outsourced in India or outside India. Further, special incentives such as subsidies or weighted deduction for R&D expenditure can also help companies that undertake R&D on rare diseases. There are 7,000–8,000 rare diseases, but less than 5% have therapies available to treat them. Due to their low prevalence, these diseases have historically received less attention in terms of R&D.The Indian pharmaceutical industry ranks thirdglobally in production by volume. But the scarcity of medicines for some period during the pandemic put our dependence on imports in focus. Allocating more funds to establish Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) parks and promote domestic manufacturing will support an ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ and ‘Make in India’ initiatives. For the industry to build a resilient and globally competitive manufacturing ecosystem, export and other incentives are a major factor. For example, extension of profit linked tax benefits for a longer duration for specific states and reduced tax rate of 15% to new manufacturing units of existing companies. Policy measures can boost domestic manufacturing through public procurement orders and phased manufacturing programmes.Despite India being one of the lead exporters of generic medicines, the majority of our population lacks sufficient access to affordable medicines. There is a need to allocate more funds to make quality medications available at affordable prices. The scope of Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana (PMBJP) can also be expanded, and the number of Health and Wellness Centres (HWCs) can be increased to cater to a larger population.In the pharma industry, ease of doing business (India ranked 63 in the World Bank’s Doing Business Report 2020) can be improved in several cases. Globally, healthcare practitioners provide free physician samples to demonstrate drug efficacy and gain experience regarding the drugs. In India as well, free medical samples distributed by pharma companies to healthcare practitioners for testing/ acquiring experience can be excluded from the ambit of Section 194R, which requires a person to deduct tax on benefit or perquisite arising from business or profession, to bring it in line with the prevailing trade practices. Similarly, Input Tax Credit (ITC) on free samples and on destruction of expired goods can be allowed.Further, there is an additional compliance burden on taxpayers as the tax department collects information in terms of TCS at the time of sale of goods under Section 206C(1H) as well as TDS under Section 194Q at the time of purchase of goods. The TCS compliance can be removed, since the tax department would already have the details based on TDS.The Indian healthcare sector is the seventh biggest emitter of climate footprint globally. Therefore, a shift towards sustainability must go hand in hand with ‘Make in India’ initiatives. Lower tax rates, deductions on expenditure incurred for adopting green technology, providing grants to companies researching on environment friendly manufacturing processes and development of green chemistry applications can make sustainability projects more fiscally viable.The Indian pharmaceutical and healthcare industry is keenly awaiting Union Budget 2024 for progressive policies that would fuel its growth and innovation to amplify its contribution in achieving the objective of ‘Viksit Bharat’ by 2047.",The pharmaceutical industry is looking forward to fiscal policies and allocations that will make it a US$130 billion-industry by 2030 and US$450 billion by 2047. Innovation is key if India is to continue being the world’s pharmacy as also to meet our domestic needs.

Green push and EV ecosystem

Easing bottlenecks

Pushing EV adoption through hybrids

Supporting R&D

(Saurabh Agarwal is Tax Partner and Parul Nagpal is Tax Partner, EY India. G Sriram, Tax Professional, EY India also contributed to the article)

Budget 2024 auto sector expectations: As the country eagerly awaits Union Budget 2024-25 , the first by the new NDA government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the auto industry seeks continued support. In the past, the government has provided impetus to the industry through multiple incentives schemes like Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles (FAME), Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme, and more.Many major brands have taken advantage of the supportive policy environment for EVs and have set up or expanded manufacturing facilities. Several others are planning to set up operations here. The industry grew 19% in value in FY24 from the previous year, to reach Rs 10.2 lakh crore. As the industry gears up for the opportunities within India and other global markets, it looks towards additional support from the government to increase competitiveness at the global level and boost domestic demand, making India the world's leading auto manufacturing hub.In the long term, the government aims for a much larger share for electric mobility, which aligns with our environmental imperatives. At the same time, there are near-term concerns that need to be addressed to boost EV adoption.. Electric Vehicle production and sales have grown rapidly because of policy support so far but need a few additional measures to develop and solidify the EV ecosystem. This includes financing for charging infrastructure, battery swapping stations, and R&D in EV technology. Additionally, to ensure competitiveness, the sector is looking for an extension of concessional import duties on lithium-ion cells, a crucial EV component. Incentivising domestic battery production offers dual benefits: one, it can lower the cost of EVs, and two, reduce our reliance on imports.Also Check | Budget 2024 Expectations Live Updates: Income Tax changes, record capex for roads and railways expected from FM Nirmala Sitharaman EV manufacturers operating under the Manufacture and Other Operations in Warehouse Regulations (MOOWR) licenses currently face a double whammy.The EV manufacturers under the MOOWR licence are liable to bear tax cost on inputs, i.e., GST on imported components, and embedded tax cost on procurements from India. However, on their exports, they are not eligible for the benefit of refunds on embedded taxes and duties available under the Remission of Duties and Taxes on Exported Products (RoDTEP) scheme. The industry expectation is that this imbalance will be resolved and MOOWR-licensed EV manufacturers will get a level playing field which will ensure that they have a competitive edge, exports get a boost and consumers gain from affordable EVs.High GST and income tax collections present an opportunity for tax relief for automakers and component manufacturers. To boost manufacturing, a concessional corporate tax rate of 15% for new manufacturing companies was introduced in 2019 and its sunset date was last extended till 31 March 2024.Therefore, the industry also seeks further extension of the concessional income tax benefits for newly established manufacturing companies for another year at the least.Also Read | Income Tax Expectations Budget 2024: What are the ideal new tax regime slabs, rates for middle class, salaried? TOI Online Survey findings The industry is bogged down by complex customs procedures specifically relating to HS Classification, valuation, interpretation of exemption notifications and strict compliance of conditions to avail these exemption. To improve ease of doing business (EoDB), a one-time amnesty scheme for resolving long-pending litigation can be introduced.Though GST is not part of the Union Budget exercise and all matters relating to it get decided only in GST Council meetings, the Union Finance Minister is the head of the GST council. This is why it makes sense to look at the GST issues also in this article here. To push Indian consumers towards EV consumption, hybrid vehicles play a critical role in changing the preferences. However, the Compensation Cess presently for four wheelers exceeding 1200 CC and length exceeding 4000 mm, is as high as 15%. It is important to bring down the Compensation Cess to promote sale of hybrids.While several points on the wish-list hold near-term benefits, over the long term, it is crucial that India supports R&D in the sector. Rapid technological advancements are disrupting the auto sector. With internal combustion engine vehicles facing increasing competition from EVs, hybrids, and hydrogen fuel cell technology, Indian manufacturers are investing heavily in R&D. Incentives, cashbacks, or weighted deductions on income tax to offset R&D costs will promote the development of new-age vehicles. Moreover, higher levels of connectivity, software and electronic content in vehicles is also driving innovation. To reduce dependence on imports and foreign technology, it is important to support indigenous EV cell production and technology. Scalable solutions will also add fuel to exports.The Indian auto industry, with a turnover of Rs 20 lakh crore, is one of India’s biggest manufacturing success stories. By addressing the concerns raised, this budget can help the industry maintain as well as build on its current momentum in the global manufacturing landscape.","Budget 2024 auto sector expectations: As the country eagerly awaits Union Budget 2024-25, the first by the new NDA government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the auto industry seeks continued support.

Turning volatility into opportunity

Infrastructure push

Value play to increase income

From vulnerability to resilience

Targeted support

(Pushan Sharma is Director- Research at CRISIL Market Intelligence & Analytics)

Budget 2024 expectations : The focus on agriculture is expected to continue this budget, given the crucial role the sector plays in economic growth, contributing to food security and employing a large chunk of the country’s workforce. The government can provide a fillip to this sector by laying emphasis on four Vs – volatility, value, vital infrastructure, and vulnerability.The first three Vs are interlinked.Volatility in prices of produce can be curtailed through vital infrastructure at the farm-gate level, in turn increasing value realisation for farmers’ produce. The fourth V refers to farmers' vulnerability to climate change and pest attacks.Consumer price inflation has been elevated over the past two years, driven by prices of food items such as tomato, onion and potato. Looking closely, these crops show seasonality in prices, i.e., they do not remain elevated throughout the year.For instance, retail prices of tomato breached Rs 100/kg in June but stood at Rs 32/kg during January and February. Had tomato and onion been procured at low prices at the start of the year and processed into tomato puree and onion powder, their prices would not have shot up in June. What’s more, farmers would not have fetched abysmally low prices at the start of the year and consumers would not have paid high prices in June—so, it would be a win-win for both.Also Check | Budget 2024 Expectations Live Updates: Income Tax changes, record capex for roads and railways expected from FM Nirmala Sitharaman Essential infrastructure needs to reach the farm gate, beyond processing. That is the balance the government would strive for in this budget as farmers constitute half the country’s population and consumers the other half.The Central Institute of Post-Harvest Engineering & Technology reported post-harvest losses of Rs 92,650 crore per year as of fiscal 2023. Further, CRISIL MI&A Research’s on-ground assessment indicates that post-harvest losses are north of 20% for various fruits and vegetables—a case in point is litchi from Bihar.The budget should prioritise farm-gate infrastructure such as sorting, grading, packaging, storage and warehousing.Placing overripe or spoilt produce away from raw categories could substantially reduce overall spoilage. Moreover, grading fruits into categories based on their quality could help fetch higher prices.The government has been looking for ways to increase farmer income. This can be achieved sustainably by increasing value realisation for farmers’ produce.Other ways such as reducing costs and providing direct cash transfer to farmers are not as effective.The Minimum Support Price (MSP) for kharif marketing year 2024-25 was announced on June 19, 2024. The average MSP increased ~7% on-year for Kharif season 2024-25 and clocked a compound annual growth rate of 6% in the past decade (fiscal 2014 to fiscal 2025), favouring farmers.Also Read | Budget 2024: Top 4 things FM Nirmala Sitharaman should do for agriculture As not all crops are procured at MSP, the budget allocation under the Market Intervention Scheme and Price Support Scheme bears watching.There is immense scope for enhancing the value of produce, given that India’s agricultural exports, currently at $45 billion, are targeted to reach $100 billion by 2030.Branding enabled India to become one of the largest exporters of rice, especially basmati rice, before export curbs. Another critical factor was market linkages.These aspects can be applied to other crops as well, be it Lakadong turmeric from Meghalaya, which is rich in curcumin content, or litchi from Bihar.Also Read | Income Tax Expectations Budget 2024: What can the salaried, individual taxpayers expect? Top points The budget will not be complete unless it takes steps to reduce vulnerability of farmers to climate change and pest attacks.The risk of climate change is no longer a distant one, as frequent heatwaves, inconsistent monsoon and other erratic weather events indicate.The government should increase allocation for agricultural research and development to have technologies that can help counter unprecedented climatic patterns and produce pest-resistant seed varieties.Focus needs to shift from direct financial support to input support to drive technological adoption among farmers and improve sector productivity.India can draw lessons from Zambia’s Fertilizer Support Programme 2002, aimed at improving smallholder farmers’ access to fertilisers and seeds. The programme led to enhanced maize production and contributed to national food security and economic growth.The income support of Rs 6,000 to Indian farmers under PM-Kisan Samman Nidhi scheme has remained unchanged since its introduction in 2019. Meanwhile, cost of cultivation has soared.Increased disbursement will help farmers purchase higher-quality inputs and take better care of their farms, thereby reducing their vulnerability to climate change and enhancing the value for their produce.","The focus on agriculture is expected to continue this budget, given the crucial role the sector plays in economic growth. The government can provide a fillip to this sector by laying emphasis on four Vs – volatility, value, vital infrastructure, and vulnerability.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111897982,imgsize-111690,width-400,resizemode-4/111897982.jpg"
Budget 2024 expectations: Robust infrastructure framework can reduce overall logistics cost of transportation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2024-expectations-robust-infrastructure-framework-can-reduce-overall-logistics-cost-of-transportation/articleshow/111861255.cms,"By Neetu Vinayek

Inland Cruise Shipping: Growth Opportunities and Policy Impetus

(The author is Partner (Infrastructure), EY India. Jasdeep Sahni, Director, EY India also contributed to the article. Views are personal)

Budget 2024 expectations for infrastructure: As India marches towards becoming an economic powerhouse, given the significant allocation of Rs 11.11 lakh crore (representing 3.4% of the GDP) in the interim budget for 2024, the infrastructure sector being a cornerstone of India's growth narrative, is expected to continue receiving considerable attention.While much of the attention was earlier focused on highways, a holistic approach to the infrastructure sector will not only facilitate efficient connectivity but also play a vital role in job creation and improving the standard of living. A robust infrastructure framework can also reduce the overall logistics cost of transportation, which is one of the key objectives of the National Logistics Policy, 2022. With the shipping sector being a major emitter, green shipping initiatives are gaining momentum as India seeks to align with global standards and contribute to the fight against climate change.The Indian government has launched the National Maritime Development Programme , which includes provisions for eco-friendly shipbuilding and recycling. Since vessels running on clean fuel require higher capex, the upcoming Budget should consider incentivising ship buyers to invest in green vessels, which would facilitate the maritime industry's shift towards more environmentally friendly operations.Also Check | Budget 2024 Expectations Live Updates: Will FM Nirmala Sitharaman give income tax relief, bring changes in new tax regime? In addition, the Maritime Amrit Kaal vision underscores the government's commitment to establishing green hydrogen hub facilities at all Indian ports. By extending the sunset clause for production of sustainable fuels and manufacturing of hydrogen fuel cells, India can simultaneously attract investment in green shipping technologies and make strides towards its ambitious net-zero emissions target. Such policy measures would not only foster innovation in the maritime sector but also contribute to the global movement towards a sustainable and resilient shipping industry.The burgeoning inland cruise shipping sector also presents an opportunity for growth as there is a need to develop ports to accommodate large cruise vessels and build terminals with modern infrastructure to enhance passenger experience. While the Cruise Shipping Policy of 2008 aims to make India an attractive cruise tourism destination, significant funds are needed to develop infrastructural facilities at various ports of the country. Further, permitting companies to carry out ‘domestic cruising’ from the GIFT City and extending the benefit of 10 years’ tax holiday may encourage cruising companies to register their units in the International Financial Services Centre (IFSC). This strategic move would stimulate the domestic cruising industry, leading to increased tourism revenue and broader economic benefits.The National Rail Plan is a step towards building a state-of-the-art railway system and increasing the share of freight traffic to 45% by 2030. In the 2024 interim Budget, the Finance Minister had announced implementation of economic corridor programmes aimed at fostering multi-modal connectivity, improving logistics efficiency and accelerating GDP growth. The upcoming Budget is expected to build on this momentum, with industry experts anticipating weighted tax deductions in connection with research & development activities. These tax deductions, if announced, would be in line with the Indian Railway Innovation Policy and are likely to stimulate investment in critical areas such as safety equipment, rail infrastructure enhancement, and the integration of cutting-edge technologies.Also Read | Union Budget 2024: What Modi government can do to promote sustainable & affordable living through green housing Another major segment of infrastructure development in India is aviation, which is currently experiencing a significant upswing, as demonstrated by the remarkable order of over 1,100 aircraft by Indian carriers within a mere 15-month period, all slated for delivery within the next five years. This surge in acquisitions underscores the rapid advancement of the industry. To sustain and amplify this growth, it is imperative that the government fortifies the necessary ecosystem and infrastructure. A key component to support this expansion is the development of comprehensive Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul (MRO) facilities within the country. Enhanced MRO capabilities will ensure minimal aircraft downtime, thereby optimizing operational efficiency. Considering these developments, the government should consider introducing fiscal incentives to encourage the establishment of state-of-the-art MRO services capable of accommodating large aircraft fleets in India.While the upcoming Budget is an opportunity for the government to reaffirm its commitment towards infrastructure development, the anticipation surrounding the Budget is palpable among various stakeholders, who are eager to see a continuation and expansion of supportive measures. In addition to incentive-based programmes like the PLI scheme and reduction in corporate tax rates, the Budget strategy must continue to focus on financial and regulatory incentives including substantial investments in infrastructure.With continued investment in infrastructure, policy reforms, digitalization, skill development, and green logistics, governments and businesses can further enhance the resilience and competitiveness of the sector. The above is a wish list of expectations which if accepted shall have the potential to significantly provide further impetus to the infrastructure sector. The right mix of financial allocations and policy reforms can help unlock the sector’s potential and drive the nation towards the vision of Viksit Bharat.","The infrastructure sector being a cornerstone of India's growth narrative, is expected to continue receiving considerable attention. Green shipping initiatives are gaining momentum as India seeks to align with global standards and contribute to the fight against climate change.

Bengaluru: Two out of the four top IT firms in India have seen a net addition in the headcount in the June quarter of 2024-25. This comes after multiple quarters of reduction in headcount for all of these firms. TCS had a net addition to the employee count last in the first quarter of FY24, after which for three straight quarters, the firm reported a drop.Even in the June quarter of FY25, a meagre 523 employees were added by India’s biggest IT services firm. The net addition was a result of an increased utilisation of last year’s recruits, the company said in its analyst call after the Q1FY25 earnings.Infosys has had five straight quarters of headcount reduction, including in the June quarter of FY25, while Wipro has finally reported a net addition after reporting a decline during the entire 2023-24 fiscal year.HCL has been reporting additions and declines intermittently in the last five quarters. Analysts say IT demand is still to fully recover, but there are green shoots to which companies are having to cater to. “To address this, companies are adopting various strategies: some are slowing down hiring, others are focusing on reskilling or upskilling their existing employees, and some are balancing the hiring of freshers with laterals,” Biswajit Maity, senior principal analyst at Gartner, says.Pareekh Jain, CEO and lead analyst at Pareekh Consulting, says an addition to the total headcount is a reflection of IT firms preparing for a recovery in demand.Despite forecasting uncertainties in the demand environment, IT firms have announced clear plans of hiring freshers. They have also stated that they will complete onboarding of all freshers who were hired in the last couple of years. Kapil Joshi, deputy CEO of IT staffing at Quess Corp, said that fresher hiring will boost the net headcount.TCS has said it will add 40,000 freshers this year, while Infosys has given an estimate of 20,000 freshers from campus and through the off-campus route. Wipro has said it will bring onboard 10,000 to 12,000 freshers this year and go to campuses to hire the same number for next year. Pareekh Jain says even those who haven’t added to their net employee count will do so next quarter as companies prepare for growth, with certain clients and segments beginning to spend on technology advancements.","Two out of the four top IT firms in India have seen a net addition in the headcount in the June quarter of 2024-25.

Things turn sour for Krishnagiri mango pulp manufacturers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/things-turn-sour-for-krishnagiri-mango-pulp-manufacturers/articleshow/111908677.cms,"It’s been a double whammy for mango growers in Krishnagiri district this year. Lack of rain at the appropriate time and unseasonal hailstorms later hit yield. And then export of mango pulp has been hit by competition from South Africa, China, Mexico, Cambodia, and Vietnam.Krishnagiri district is the leading manufacturer and exporter of mango pulp in the country.Mangoes are grown on 40,000 hectares in the district and Bengalura (Totapuri), Alphonso, and Neelam are specifically used for pulp production.E Madhavan, general secretary of the Krishnagiri District Pulp Processors’ Federation (KDPPF), says they’ve had to buy mangoes from Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, and Karnataka to make pulp this year. According to the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA), in 2023-24, the country exported 60,900.23 tonnes of mango pulp valued at `624.29 crore to countries including Saudi Arabia, USA, the UK, Germany, and Canada.Krishnagiri district has 22 pulp units that directly and indirectly provide livelihood to more than two lakh people -- farmers, farm workers and workers in the pulp industry.A pulp processor, who asked not to be named, says that South Africa, China, Indonesia, Thailand, Mexico, Cambodia, Pakistan, Vietnam, Philippines, Brazil, Nigeria, Egypt, and Australia have now ventured into mango cultivation. Of them, South Africa, China, Mexico, Cambodia, and Vietnam were also producing mango pulp. This has led to a decrease in orders for India’s mango and pulp.“Over the past decade, export duty and freight charges from India to other countries have also tripled,” he says. The conflicts between Ukraine and Russia, Israel and Palestine, and the crisis in the Red Sea region have also impacted mango pulp exports from India by raising shipping costs. This has allowed exporters from South America to dominate the market.Krishnagiri pulp processors also blame local farmers for drop in demand. They say the use of cultar, a plant growth regulator, in cultivation of mango has led to drop in demand for Indian mangoes abroad. Cultar contains the active ingredient ‘Paclobutrazol’ that impacts the hormonal balance of the plant. For instance, a mango tree that typically yields fruit for only three months a year can produce fruit year-round using cultar.But, says P K Muralidharan, a mango farmer from Kaveripattinam, cultar affects sweetness, colour, and aroma of the fruit. He says harvesting mangoes within 60 days because of cultar instead of the recommended 90 days results in an overall decline in fruit quality and has hit demand for India’s mango pulp in international markets. He wants the state govt to prohibit farmers from using cultar. Farmers should transition to organic farming to stay competitive globally, he adds.Mango pulp producers have a set of demands for govt too. They say they have to pay HT charges for power year-round, though their factories operate for just three months -- May, June, and July. They want the state govt to waive demand charges for HT lines during the operational months and exempt them during the idle months. They also want GST exemption for mangoes like for eggs.","Krishnagiri district is the leading manufacturer and exporter of mango pulp in the country.

Harvesting the delta,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/harvesting-the-delta/articleshow/111908656.cms,"Think of the Cauvery delta and paddy fields come to mind. Soon, however, the delta districts will produce a range of agro and food products, not just rice. Having declared the area a protected agriculture zone in February 2020, the Tamil Nadu govt is planning a `2,084 crore agro-industrial corridor.The plan is to have five food parks, each covering 20-25 acres, in Trichy, Mayiladuthurai, Nagapattinam, Tiruvarur and Thanjavur districts.The state govt has approved an investment of `1,170 crore through the Tamil Nadu Food Processing and Agri Export Promotion Corporation (TNAPEx).While the food park in Trichy will focus on fruits and vegetables, those in Thanjavur and Tiruvarur will make paddy and palmyra products. Parks in Mayiladuthurai and Nagapattinam will focus on dairy and fisheries. State-owned Sidco will build the parks to house MSMEs.The units will be export-oriented to augment income for the local farmers. It helps that the delta has an international airport at Trichy and easy connectivity to the ports at Tuticorin, Vizhinjam, Chennai and Kochi.“We are targeting at least 2,000 MSMEs to operate in these food parks. The manufacturing units will source raw materials largely from farmers in the delta districts. With paddy being the major crop, value-added products such as rice bran oil, cattle feed and silica from rice husk would be explored,” said a TNAPEx official. Incentives are also offered for MSMEs that set up units in the corridor (See graphics).“The state govt is encouraging agro-based industries to set up facilities in the delta region,” says MSME secretary Archana Patnaik. “We are creating an ecosystem to support them,” she adds.As part of the initiative, Tamil Nadu Start-up and Innovation Mission (Tansim) will launch an agri-focused innovation hub at Tidel Neo, Thanjavur. “It will support startups to market farm produce and to use data analytics to predict the weather and help farmers choose the right crops to grow,” says Tansim CEO Sivarajah Ramanathan.State industries minister TRB Rajaa, who is the MLA from Mannargudi in Tiruvarur district, says the govt’s strategy is to attract big brands and large companies along with MSMEs, ensuring a visible impact on farm revenue. “We have had detailed discussions with major national and international food processing companies for several months now, and you can expect major announcements on this front soon,” he adds.“To leverage the existing supply of raw materials, we are bringing in companies that can process these products across the value chain,” says Rajaa. “In the delta districts, since paddy cultivation is common, we are looking to bring in companies that build on that ecosystem. This will help our farmers leverage their expertise to improve farm income and agricultural practices,” he adds.In line with the govt’s target, diversified agri-business company Godrej Agrovet’s oil palm plantation business established its first ‘samadhan’ centre in the state at Thanjavur a fortnight ago. It is a one-stop solution centre offering inputs, tools, services and solutions for oil palm farmers to enhance yield and improve productivity. Such centres would be set up in Cuddalore, Villupuram and Tiruvarur over the next 18 months to increase the area under oil palm to 6,000 hectares over the next three years.Dodla Dairy, which already has three plants in Dharmapuri and Dindigul districts, is looking at the delta districts for its fourth plant in Tamil Nadu. “The availability of milk, which is a revenue stream for farmers, will help our expansion in the delta region,” says Dodla Sunil Reddy, managing director, Dodla Dairy. “Depending on the volume of milk procured, we will explore whether the facility can make value-added products such as ice-creams, flavoured milk, paneer, ghee and sweets for 11 states, where we are operating.”More farmer producer organisations (FPOs) should be set up and we should take a cue from China and make value-added products such as chips from rice, says Ganesh Kumar, director of A2 Diary Farms and co-convenor, food and agri panel, CII Trichy zone.The agro-industrial corridor should also focus on wooing coconut oil extraction units, says Swamimalai Sundara Vimalanathan, secretary, Tamil Nadu Cauvery Farmers Protection Association. “Coconut cultivation is spread over 1.5 lakh acres across the delta districts. We get hardly `8-9 per coconut. If oil extraction units are established, they will procure at least `20 per coconut, “ he says.","The plan is to have five food parks, each covering 20-25 acres, in Trichy, Mayiladuthurai, Nagapattinam, Tiruvarur and Thanjavur districts. The state govt has approved an investment of `1,170 crore through the Tamil Nadu Food Processing and Agri Export Promotion Corporation.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,imgsize-110164,width-400,resizemode-4/47529300.jpg"
UAPA Case: Umar Khalid seeks bail in UAPA case before Delhi High Court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/umar-khalid-seeks-bail-in-uapa-case-before-delhi-high-court/articleshow/111893322.cms,"NEW DELHI: Former JNU student Umar Khalid has approached Delhi High Court , seeking bail in the larger conspiracy case of the Delhi riots in 2020. The case is listed for hearing before a division bench comprising justices Prathiba M Singh and Amit Sharma on July 22. Khalid has been booked under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA).The case is being investigated by Special Cell of Delhi Police. Delhi Police has alleged that Khalid had pre-planned protests in 2020 at 23 sites that resulted in riots.His second bail plea was rejected by the trial court in May this year. The court said that the previous order of the court rejecting bail had attained finality.On May 28, the court, while rejecting his bail plea, stated that there was no delay in the framing of charges and commencement of the trial by Delhi Police. The court further added that, in fact, the accused persons had moved separate applications requesting that before framing the charges, the prosecution be asked whether the investigation was complete. “Thus, when the delay in the proceedings is not on the part of the prosecution and, in fact, is on the part of the accused persons, the applicant cannot take benefit of the same,” said the court. On May 13, the court had reserved the order on his bail application.In March 2022, the trial court had first denied bail to Khalid, following which he approached Delhi High Court, which also denied him relief in Oct 2022. Following this, Khalid moved to Supreme Court. In May 2023, the apex court asked Delhi Police to file a response in the case. His plea was adjourned at least 14 times before SC. On Feb 14 of this year, he withdrew his bail plea from the top court, citing a change in circumstances, and moved to the trial court.Earlier, the prosecution opposing the bail had submitted before the court that Khalid’s WhatsApp chat revealed he was in the habit of creating social media narratives to influence bail hearings. Khalid’s counsel disputed this argument, asking whether sharing WhatsApp messages was a criminal or terror act.On April 24, Khalid had told the court that the court must examine each witness and analyse each document while hearing his bail plea to determine whether a terror case is made against him.Khalid, through his counsel, senior advocate Trideep Pais also told the court that Delhi Police was repeating his name like a mantra in the chargesheet and there was a vicious media trial against him.The counsel was rebutting the Delhi Police’s argument that Khalid was creating social media narratives to influence bail hearings.",The case is listed for hearing before a division bench comprising justices Prathiba M Singh and Amit Sharma on July 22.

Hard to implement IMF deal as political pressure surges in Pakistan: Experts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/hard-to-implement-imf-deal-as-political-pressure-surges-in-pakistan-experts/articleshow/111900453.cms,"ISLAMABAD: The current fiscal year's tax-laden budget and the Supreme Court's ruling on reserved seats have shifted the focus of politics to the economy , further posing doubts over Pakistan 's ability to meet the new International Monetary Fund (IMF) conditions for a $7 billion loan, reported Dawn.A senior researcher said, ""This is crucial to determining if the government can meet the conditions for a USD 7 billion IMF loan agreement.Nonetheless, I am confident the government will sign the deal at any cost.""According to the analysts, the government is seeking China's help to restructure its substantial $28 billion debt.However, sources have suggested that China is unlikely to restructure these loans, fearing that other nations, like Sri Lanka, may also seek debt restructuring from Beijing.Bankers and analysts agreed that the country has been facing significant challenges, with political pressure mounting to provide relief to the public, Dawn reported.""The government has failed to offer any relief, instead exacerbating the situation by repeatedly increasing fuel and electricity prices,"" a senior banker said, noting that only banks and the equity market are enjoying the ""worst economy,"" recording historic profits.On the contrary, sectors like textiles are calling for tax reductions and price controls. Exporters are also dissatisfied with the new taxes on their income.The annual inflation rate for FY24 stood at 23.4%, leaving the real interest rate negative by three per cent.""How can we expect any big cut in the interest rate in the future to stimulate the economy?"" the banker questioned.The sources said that the IMF has asked the State Bank to maintain fiscal discipline, implying no substantial relief in interest rates soon.The high cost of doing business has already led to economic contraction in FY23, with a mere 2.4 per cent growth in FY24.""If the political situation remains unstable, significant growth in FY25 is unlikely, which will increase unemployment and deepen political uncertainties,"" noted an analyst. The IMF projects 3.5% growth for FY25, while Fitch Ratings estimates 3.2%.Faisal Mamsa, CEO of Tresmark, showed optimism and said that the IMF deal will unlock additional funding sources, stabilise the rupee and bolster foreign exchange reserves.However, he expressed concerns about the political and social challenges in the country, which could complicate the successful implementation of IMF conditions, as reported by Dawn.""Moody's points out that Pakistan has historically struggled with implementing the structural reforms required by IMF programmes, which casts doubt on the current deal's effectiveness,"" he said.Despite campaigns for deals with Saudi Arabia, UAE and China, no substantial progress has been made, nor has privatisation of any government entity gone through, Mamsa said, adding that the anti-poor budget may not be sustainable in the long term.","The current fiscal year's tax-laden budget and the Supreme Court's ruling on reserved seats have shifted the focus of politics to the economy.

Using SIMBARA, the government would be able to track the nickel and tin from mines to domestic smelters .""Smelting companies have to register where they buy the nickel from and where the mines are,"" Septian Hario Seto, deputy coordinating minister for maritime and investment affairs, said in an interview.Smelters will not be allowed to unload ore shipments from mines that have not yet paid their royalties. The system successfully increased government revenue in the coal sector, Seto told Reuters, and hoped to see similar improvement in the nickel and tin sectors.The SIMBARA system will also be linked to the government's digital records of mining quotas , known as RKAB. It enables miners to track how much production quota a miner has left for the period and to alert authorities should there be discrepancies in output and sales data, he added.A senior official has said Jakarta will implement the system on other minerals such as bauxite and copper, but the timing would be decided later on, once the nickel and tin tracking system has run smoothly.","Indonesia is the world's biggest producer of nickel and one of its largest producers of tin.

Stock traders in Asia are ramping up the Trump trade in preparation for a potential second term for the former US president, which will likely create winners and losers in the region.Donald Trump ’s “America first” policies on trade, defense and other industries would hamper the outlook of a myriad of sectors in Asia from agriculture and farm equipment to textiles and weapons production.Asian companies’ momentum in the global race for electric vehicles and chips could slow should a Trump administration follow through on his pledges.China is seen as a clear loser given Trump’s call for higher tariffs and confrontational rhetoric against the world’s second largest economy. Taiwan and South Korea, which are heavily reliant on export revenues from semiconductor and other tech sectors, are also staring at an outlook downturn, market watchers say.India is deemed as a potential beneficiary should the former US president’s polling hold up and lead to his win in November. Southeast Asian economies, whose fortunes aren’t closely tied to exports, may be able to deflect much of the fallout from a change in the White House, investors say.Here is what market watchers are saying“India stands out as an economy that is relatively shielded from these shocks as the country has only a small share of global goods markets and is less exposed to China-related risks.”“It looks like India has a much better relationship with the US than China. At least from India’s side, the impact of Trump was not as bad as it was for many other emerging markets. It’s difficult to think it’ll be different this time.”“China’s obviously going to be one of the most affected if those tariffs really come in place and if Trump successfully can put enough pressure on the EU to also put some tariffs of their own on China.”Still, “a lot of companies are diversifying their markets or starting to diversify the supply chains and build manufacturing facilities outside of China. And even if a Trump presidency imposes high tariffs, Europe might decide not to follow it unless there is some really super strong political pressure.”“For Japan, we believe that risks are more balanced than China as the country’s sensitivity to global trade is a bit lower, and its relations with the US will likely remain solid even under the Trump administration.”“We also see the opportunity for the country to cement its semiconductor sector renaissance if Taiwan or South Korea end up bearing the brunt of the Trump team’s potentially consequential re-calibration of the US strategy for them.”“In Asia, the biggest beneficiaries are likely to be Vietnam, Taiwan, and Malaysia. Vietnam has been benefiting from the lower-end manufacturing, such as textile and wooden furniture, while Taiwan and Malaysia have been benefiting from electronic products supply chain shifts.”“Southeast Asia will be in a pretty good position because of what’s happening with China. So in that sense, Southeast Asia would be good. Thailand even, well, Vietnam may get into some trouble because they’re doing so much manufacturing of Chinese goods, but they’re also doing a lot of manufacturing for Korea.”“For Asia, it would really affect the tech-related ones more. It’s really whether the momentum trade of Taiwan, Korea is going to continue a bit longer, versus Asean being a bit more resilient, less tied to the tech sector, and having the China plus one strategy and secular themes playing out.”","Donald Trump ’s “America first” policies on trade, defense and other industries would hamper the outlook of a myriad of sectors in Asia.

While FLOKI price predictions might unveil a bullish trend and Bitcoin forecasts seem promising, BlockDAG stands out as one of the most popular cryptocurrencies for its success and immense growth potential.FLOKI price has encountered resistance near the $0.000150 mark during the past week. A breakout above this level could indicate a bullish trend, with technical indicators and on-chain metrics suggesting a potential 30% rebound in the short-to-medium term.FLOKI’s price prediction points towards a rally as the meme coin approaches a key support level, coupled with a rise in development activity.

Svenson, addressing his YouTube subscribers, believes Bitcoin has likely bottomed out after hitting a five-month low of $53,563. He expects a sideways recovery followed by a new all-time high.Svenson highlights bullish divergence on the daily time frame for two momentum oscillator indicators, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD). With Bitcoin in oversold territory according to the daily RSI, the Bitcoin forecast appears promising for a potential upward reversal.BlockDAG is stirring the presale world, having raised an impressive $58.8 million and sold 12.1 billion coins as it progresses into its 20th batch.

Bank Of England: UK inflation holds at 2% but underlying price pressures stay strong,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/uk-inflation-holds-at-2-but-underlying-price-pressures-stay-strong/articleshow/111806256.cms,"British inflation held at 2.0 per cent last month, defying forecasts for a slight fall, and underlying price pressures persisted, maintaining uncertainty about the date of the Bank of England 's first interest rate cut since 2020.Economists polled by Reuters had mostly expected headline consumer price inflation would ease to 1.9per cent in the 12 months to June, extending its drop from a peak of 11.1per cent in October 2022.Inflation for services was much stronger at 5.7 per cent, the Office for National Statistics said, unchanged from May. The Reuters poll had pointed to a slightly weaker 5.6per cent increase.Sterling rose against the dollar immediately after the data was published.The BoE - which has a target of consumer price inflation of 2 per cent - has expressed concern about the strength of services inflation, which largely reflects pressure from wage growth in a labour market short of candidates to fill jobs.Data due on Thursday is expected to show wages growing slightly less strongly than in data published a month ago but still rising by almost 6per cent - roughly double the rate that would be compatible with keeping inflation at 2per cent.The BoE is due to announce its next decision on interest rates on Aug. 1 and investors see a roughly 50per cent chance of a first cut to borrowing costs since 2020.A rate cut next month would give an early boost to new Prime Minister Keir Starmer and his finance minister Rachel Reeves who have said they will speed up the slow-moving British economy after winning power in a landslide election two weeks ago.But last week the BoE's Chief Economist, Huw Pill, said he was focused on persistently strong price pressures and said the timing of the first rate cut was an open question.Core inflation - excluding volatile food and energy prices - held at 3.5 per cent in the 12 months to June, the ONS said, matching the median forecast in the Reuters poll.The BoE had expected headline inflation of 2.0 per cent in June and services inflation of 5.1per cent, according to forecasts it published two months ago. The BoE also expected headline inflation to rise back above its target later this year and through 2025.","Inflation for services was much stronger at 5.7 per cent, the Office for National Statistics said.

HSBC appoints insider Georges Elhedery as CEO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/hsbc-appoints-insider-georges-elhedery-as-ceo/articleshow/111800768.cms,"LONDON: HSBC Holdings Plc said on Wednesday that Chief Financial Officer Georges Elhedery will become group CEO , a choice that highlights the global lender's preference for continuity as it looks to kickstart growth.Elhedery, 50, who becomes HSBC's third CEO in less than eight years, will replace outgoing head Noel Quinn on September 2. The 160 year old lender has traditionally appointed its CEO from within.Since 2020, Elhedery has been the co head of the Global banking and markets business, the division that houses HSBC's trading and investment banking advisory businesses.Lebanon born Elhedery, who began his career in banking as a rates trader before joining HSBC in 2005, was named the surprise successor to Ewen Stevenson as CFO in October 2022, just weeks after returning from a sabbatical.He also led HSBC's Middle Eastern, North Africa and Turkiye region as the CEO of that division between July 2016 and February 2019.""Working together with our talented team, I look forward to delivering exceptional value to our clients and investors by driving strong performance on a sustainable growth trajectory,"" he said in the bank's statement announcing his appointment.Quinn, who led the global lender for five years, will remain CEO until his successor starts in the role.His surprise departure was announced in April, and at that time he had said he wanted a better work life balance and planned to pursue a portfolio career.Quinn oversaw a raft of asset sales, navigated a global pandemic and a push by rebel investors to break up the 160 year bank, and guided the lender to record profit.The move comes at a time when HSBC, Europe's largest lender by assets with a balance sheet of $3 trillion, is betting on its historic Asian ties to ramp up profit.Since the financial crisis of 2008, HSBC has already shrunk its global footprint by around a quarter, exiting low growth markets to plough capital and resources into Asia.The bank's shares have risen 7% this year, against an 18% gain in the STOXX Europe banks index.HSBC said it will announce Elhedery's successor as Group CFO in due course. Ahead of the announcement, the bank was exploring financial incentives and reallocating key projects to retain those who miss out on the top job, two people with knowledge of the discussions told Reuters.HSBC will report its annual results on July 31.The lender's shares in Hong Kong were trading mostly flat after the announcement.","Georges Elhedery, 50, becomes HSBC's third CEO in less than eight years.

"Dow soars to fresh record high, small caps surge on rate cut bets",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/dow-soars-to-fresh-record-high-small-caps-surge-on-rate-cut-bets/articleshow/111797044.cms,"The US stock market surged to new heights on Tuesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average reaching a record closing level. This rally was fueled by expectations of potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve in 2024, which could boost the economy and corporate profits. The positive sentiment was further supported by strong earnings reports from major companies like Bank of America and UnitedHealth Group.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 742.76 points, or 1.85%, to 40,954.48, the S&P 500 gained 35.98 points, or 0.64%, at 5,667.2 and the Nasdaq Composite added 36.77 points, or 0.2%, at 18,509.34.Of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500, industrials enjoyed the largest percentage gains, while technology and communication services were the only two sectors to end in negative territory.Economically sensitive small caps extended their rally. The Russell 2000 scored a fifth straight day of gains greater than 1%, its longest winning streak since April 2000. The index gained 3.5%, touching its highest level since January 2022.Federal Reserve Governor Adriana Kugler's comments about the possibility of lowering interest rates sooner if the job market cools ""too much"" added to the optimism on Wall Street. Analysts believe that the current market environment assumes a perfect scenario where the Fed cuts rates while inflation slows down without pushing the economy into a recession. Additionally, rising expectations of a Donald Trump victory in the 2024 US presidential election, which could lead to tax cuts and deregulation, further contributed to the bullish sentiment.In contrast to the US market, European bourses experienced declines, with German investor confidence falling for the first time in a year. The International Monetary Fund maintained its global growth forecast for this year at 3.2% but trimmed its projections for the United States and Japan while warning of ongoing inflation risks and trade tensions.Gold prices also reached a new record, jumping 1.9% to $2,450.07 per ounce, driven by shifting expectations regarding the Fed's monetary policy. In Asia, markets were mixed, with Hong Kong experiencing losses in the tech sector, while other major indices saw modest gains or declines. Traders in China awaited policy measures from the country's leaders as they held a key economic meeting during the week.(With inputs from agencies)","The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 742.76 points, or 1.85%, to 40,954.48.
