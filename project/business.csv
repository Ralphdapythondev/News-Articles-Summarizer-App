NEW DELHI: The US Federal Reserve reduced interest rates by 50 basis points on Wednesday, marking the first cut in over four years. In its statement, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) said, ""In light of progress on inflation and the balance of risks, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/2 percentage point to 4.75% to 5%.""This move signals the beginning of a policy shift to ease the restrictive conditions previously implemented to control inflation.The Fed's decision will lower the rates at which commercial banks lend to consumers and businesses, reducing the cost of borrowing across a range of financial products, including mortgages, auto loans, and credit cards. This cut is expected to make borrowing more affordable, stimulating spending and investment.The ripple effects of the Fed rate cut will be felt globally, particularly in emerging markets like India.One of the most immediate likely effects of the rate cut is the potential increase in foreign investment in India. When US interest rates are high, investors tend to favor US Treasury securities for their relatively higher returns. However, with a rate cut, yields on these securities will decrease, prompting investors to seek better returns elsewhere, including in Indian equities and debt markets. This shift could lead to a substantial inflow of foreign capital into India, driving up demand for Indian stocks and bonds, which may subsequently increase their prices.The influx of foreign capital is also likely to affect the Indian Rupee (INR). As foreign investors convert their currencies into INR for investment purposes, demand for the rupee will rise, potentially leading to its appreciation against the US dollar. A stronger rupee can have mixed effects; while it may lower the cost of imports (especially crucial commodities like oil), it could also negatively impact Indian exporters by making their goods more expensive for foreign buyers.Globally lower interest rates typically lead to a rally in bond markets . In India, this could mean that existing bonds become more attractive as their yields appear favorable compared to new issues. Consequently, this dynamic may lower borrowing costs for both the government and corporations, encouraging more capital investments and stimulating economic growth .Certain sectors are poised to benefit directly from the Fed's rate cut. For instance, the information technology (IT) sector may see increased demand as US corporations expand their IT budgets due to reduced borrowing costs. Additionally, other sectors such as consumer goods and infrastructure could also experience growth as cheaper financing becomes available.The RBI's response to the Fed's actions will be crucial. Historically, Indian monetary policy has been influenced by US rates. However, RBI governor Shaktikanta Das has already signaled that India is not compelled to follow suit and reduce its own rates.The governor emphasized that maintaining financial stability remains a top priority for the central bank. ""Financial stability is a prime consideration,"" Das said, highlighting the importance of ensuring a robust and resilient financial system.Das's comments suggest that the RBI will carefully assess the domestic economic conditions and potential risks before making any decisions on interest rates.","The ripple effects of the Fed rate cut will be felt globally, particularly in emerging markets like India.

How Reliance-led Campa is taking on Coca-Cola and PepsiCo at half the price of these soft drinks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/how-reliance-led-campa-is-taking-on-coca-cola-and-pepsico-at-half-the-price-of-these-soft-drinks/articleshow/113513438.cms,"Cola wars: Thirst for a bigger sip

Campa vs Coke, Pepsi: Reliance Consumer Products (RCPL) is intensifying the cola price war by expanding its Campa soft drink range to various new markets before the festive season, offering prices that are 50% lower than those of Coca-Cola and PepsiCo .In response, the multinational brands are ramping up consumer promotions at grocery stores and quick-commerce platforms, although they have not yet reduced their prices.Industry executives told ET that Coca-Cola and PepsiCo are facing a dilemma: either drop prices and risk hurting profitability or maintain prices and potentially lose market share to a lower-priced competitor. Any pricing decisions, however, must be made in agreement with independent bottling partners.RCPL entered the Indian soft drinks market , which is dominated by Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, in 2022 by introducing the Campa range in various pack sizes and flavors at significantly lower price points than its established rivals in select markets.After a slow start, RCPL is now expanding the Campa brand across multiple markets, including southern states, West Bengal, Bihar, Odisha, and parts of Uttar Pradesh, at disruptive prices.An industry executive said, ""RCPL has hinged its FMCG strategy on affordable pricing across categories including beverages, biscuits, confectionery and detergents, at price points 30-35% lower than rivals.""This strategy aligns with the company's internal policy of being ""consumer-centric"" rather than ""competition-centric.""For instance, Campa sells 250 ml bottles at Rs 10 each, while Coca-Cola and PepsiCo sell the same size for Rs 20. Additionally, Campa offers 500 ml bottles at Rs 20, whereas its larger competitors sell them at either Rs 30 or Rs 40.Ravi Jaipuria, chairman of RJ Corp, whose group company Varun Beverages is PepsiCo's bottling and distribution partner, recently addressed an analyst's question about the potential impact of Campa's entry into the market. Jaipuria expressed confidence in the market's growth potential, saying, ""We think every new person coming in has a chance to grow the market. Reliance is a formidable competition but they will have to put more investments, more plants, more visi-coolers and we are sure being Reliance, they will do a good job. The market is so large in India, with more investments the market will only grow much faster.""Soft drink companies have been working to reduce the seasonal nature of their products by introducing new promotions and campaigns, particularly during the festive months of October to December, in addition to the peak summer quarter of April to June, which remains the most significant in terms of annual sales.According to a report released by global research firm Kantar in June, the consumption of bottled soft drinks in Indian households surpassed an annual penetration of 50% in 2023-24. The report stated, ""The bottled soft drink category grew 41% by MAT (moving annual total) in March '23 and continued to add more households and expanded 19% in MAT in March '24.""Financial data accessed by Tofler, a business intelligence platform, revealed that Coca-Cola India reported a consolidated profit of Rs 722.44 crore in FY23, representing a 57.2% increase compared to the previous year. Varun Beverages also reported a strong performance, with a consolidated net profit of Rs 1,262 crore for the June '24 quarter, a 26% growth over the same quarter in the previous year, attributed to volume growth and improved margins.",Reliance Consumer Products (RCPL) is expanding its Campa soft drink range to various new markets before the festive season.

"'Russian roulette' in markets, RBI flags volatility risks",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/russian-roulette-in-markets-rbi-flags-volatility-risks/articleshow/113538532.cms,"MUMBAI: RBI has warned of a 'Russian roulette' scenario as market expectations regarding central banks are reset. The regulator noted significant volatility risks, given that markets experience wild swings with each new data release, in its State of the Economy report.The US jobs data in Aug had caused a market downturn, only for it to rebound later. Subsequently, a manufacturing report in Sept triggered another selloff in US stocks, which then spread to Asian and European markets.In India, while IPO activity remains strong, there are concerns about promoters selling off holdings at high prices, especially in the SME segment.""As markets recalibrate their expectations of central banks pivoting from divergence to convergence, a Russian roulette seems to be playing out. Every incoming data dispels the gathering good feeling of a soft landing and sparks fears of a thudding end to disinflationary monetary policy pathways,"" the report, authored by RBI staff and led by deputy governor Michael Patra, said. Despite these fluctuations, the report observes that markets have shown resilience, recovering quickly without significant exchange rate movements or liquidity issues. Interestingly, on the day the report was released, markets rose again following a US Federal Reserve rate cut.The report notes that investors will focus on a select group of emerging economies that benefit from favourable global trade trends, a strong US dollar, economic reforms, and political changes. Additionally, RBI staff has taken a firmer stance on food inflation, pointing out that while headline inflation has moderated, food price volatility remains a risk. The report anticipates higher inflation numbers this month due to an unfavourable base effect. ""The pace of disinflation is frequently interrupted by volatile and elevated food inflation. It is the headline inflation that matters, with food inflation accounting for 46% of the overall figure,"" it emphasises.While chief economic adviser V Anantha Nageswaran has suggested excluding food prices from inflation targets, RBI maintains that they are crucial to understanding Indian prices. The report projects GDP growth for FY24 at 7.3% - up from the 7.2% forecast in Aug. ""The in-house dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model projects GDP growth at 7.3% (YoY) and headline CPI inflation at 4.6% (YoY) during 2024-25,"" it states.Other macro data indicates that household consumption is expected to grow faster in Q2 as inflation eases, supported by a revival in rural demand. The widening trade deficit and an increase in overseas travel by Indians are likely to shift the current account balance from a small surplus in early 2024 to a deficit of 1-1.2% of GDP in the first half of 2024-25.","RBI has warned of a 'Russian roulette' scenario as market expectations regarding central banks are reset.

It plans to hire 10,000 to 12,000 freshers in the current financial year. Govil said 3,000 freshers were onboarded in the June quarter, and it would finish the backlog of the previous years in the next few quarters.The employment outlook for recent engineering graduates is showing signs of improvement. Beyond bulk hiring of engineers, IT firms are keen to onboard digital talent and domain specialists in the areas of cloud, analytics, data, and AI.Additionally, the selection process has become more rigorous compared to previous years. Shailendra Vidhate, training and placement officer at the engineering college of the NMIMS group, said the cut-off to sit for the placement season has risen to 70% from 60% last year.Ashok Mittal, chancellor of Lovely Professional University, said that there's a uptick in the number of people recruited this time around - about 1,350 so far this year compared to 600 people during the same period last year. Companies are increasingly looking beyond traditional coding tests when evaluating potential hires. Instead, they are examining candidates' social media profiles and considering certifications they have earned. This shift in hiring practices reflects a desire to gain a more comprehensive understanding of each applicant's skills and background.","IT firms are tapping into colleges for skilled programmers and digital specialists.

Railway Budget 2024 : The government has wavered little in its efforts to spur a modernisation of railways in the country, pivoting on technology, to support the country’s economic ambitions. In line with expectations, Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore, marking yet another year of successive increase in outlay.That takes forward the past policies and the government’s vision, which have paved the way for modernisation of the transport behemoth.In earlier decades, the government had focused on laying tracks on new routes, electrification and incremental rolling stock capacity addition. That was the need of the hour back then and has helped set up the base for a larger transformation.For instance, the massive Dedicated Freight Corridor ( DFC ) as well as locomotive factories at Marhaura and Madhepura in Bihar were conceptualised over a decade ago and we are seeing their completion now.More recently, the focus has shifted to modernisation—of rolling stock and safety systems, among other aspects.This year, emphasis has also been laid on the railways’ crucial role in industrial development. Commodity-specific corridors have been planned in eastern India and impetus given to port connectivity. Vande Bharat and technology-led upgrades in rolling stock remain in focus. Safety has been prioritised through budgetary allocations for the anti-collision systemKavach . That said, there are other cogs in the wheel that demand attention from a long-term perspective.First, the target for the Operating Ratio, the crucial efficiency gauge, has been set at 98.22% for 2024-25, compared with 98.65% in 2023-24. This reflects an imminent need for operational transformation. An effective overhaul of the world’s fourth-largest rail network will take many years and thus we need to start focusing on improving efficiency and reducing costs now.DFC is almost entirely operational and will be complete over the next few months. To ensure the project achieves its twin goals of reducing logistics costs and enhancing freight efficiency, railways need to attract more cargo on the corridor. This will help increase the rail coefficient and make the railways’ approach more market-oriented, which will in turn aid future corridors.A revamp of railway stations is on track, with sufficient funds dedicated to this end. But even though new coaches and wagons are increasingly being added to meet footfalls, the stations and passenger trains themselves remain synonymous with chaos.Just as safety, comfort and convenience have been prioritised, there is a need for solutions to address the capacity and demand challenges. As a first step, the government could target development of new stations and setting up of new coach production units.As a leading freight mover, Indian Railways carried a record 1,588 MT cargo in fiscal 2024, up from 1,095 MT in fiscal 2015. It accounts for 26% of the cargo moved in the country—by no means an easy feat. The railways aims to take this volume to 3,000 MT by 2030, which would require a 11% CAGR against the around 4.2% witnessed over the last 10 years. As per a report by TERI and Shakti Foundation, from carrying about 62% of freight traffic in 1990-91, Indian Railways’ share has declined to ~27% in 2014-15. This has been due to the expanding road network, cost competitiveness over railways, and door-to-door service. Thus, commencing the cycle of increasing the rail share again is commendable.DFCs, a high-capacity track network, high-power locomotives and improvement in wagon designs have set the ball rolling for larger capacity, faster freight trains that deliver better efficiency.Yet, achieving exponential growth is a tall ask given the current dynamics. Possibly, similar challenges might apply to other goals the railways might have for 2047.To be fair, despite its scale and complexity, Indian Railways has been able to achieve diverse developments at commendable speed.But the track ahead is long and it is time to start discussing the reinvention of the institutional set-up.Indian Railways sees substantial private sector involvement in the form of vendors and contractors. Policymakers could start mulling extreme options such as parallel privately-owned and operated railway infrastructure, coupled with centralised planning and an evolved role for the railways. This will need a robust policy framework from the Government of India.The time is perhaps also ripe to bring user charge and asset monetisation-driven segments for passengers as well as cargo to the discussion table. Globally, the separation of infrastructure and operations in railways has delivered mixed results, for example in the United Kingdom. The model should be analysed and revisited to understand its potential relevance in the Indian context.The key would be to retrace our steps and align our long-term goals to identify not just incremental changes but also ways to explore bold and path-breaking alternatives that put Indian Railways on a smooth track and bring it up to speed.","Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore.

Budget 2024 capital gains tax changes: The Narendra Modi government is considering suggestions for tweaks in the new long term capital gains tax regime that was announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman in Union Budget 2024.The July 23 budget reduced the LTCG tax on property from 20% to 12.5%. The indexation benefit, which allowed taxpayers to adjust the acquisition cost for inflation before calculating capital gains and thus reduce their tax liability, is proposed to be eliminated for properties purchased on or after April 1, 2001.The government publishes the Cost Inflation Index (CII) annually for this calculation.India Inc is appealing to the government for a gradual shift to the long-term capital gains tax regime proposed in the FY25 budget, which aims to eliminate indexation benefits for property, gold, and other unlisted assets.According to an ET report by Deepshikha Sikarwar, the industry is suggesting alternatives such as a higher tax rate with indexation or a lower rate of 12.5% without indexation, as well as some form of grandfathering for ancestral properties.The finance ministry is currently reviewing these proposals and will discuss them with the Prime Minister's Office. The final decision will be made closer to the date when the Finance Bill reply is to be presented in Parliament, the reports said.Industry groups are expected to submit formal proposals to the finance ministry in the near future.

Budget 2024 for manufacturing sector : The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth. While the middle class has been offered tax relief, the government's primary focus remains on judicious spending to maximize economic impact. The budget's core themes are employment, skilling, MSME development, and support for the middle class.Largely focus has remained intact on spending money judiciously to ensure that each penny spent creates a ripple effect in the entire economic landscape.Although at first glance, manufacturing might appear to have taken a backseat, a deeper analysis reveals a multifaceted approach to bolstering the sector. Initiatives like employment-linked benefits and internship programs, while primarily aimed at job creation and skill development, indirectly benefit manufacturing companies by expanding the talent pool.Extensive focus on the MSME manufacturing units by way of extending term loan facility for purchase of machinery and equipment without collateral or third-party guarantee, would help companies in augmenting their capital base/ capacity and strengthen the very foundation of the manufacturing ecosystem in the country. Development of a new credit-assessment model by Public Sector Banks to assess MSME credit shall provide much needed regulatory relief to the units.With respect to the large manufacturing entities, while there is no direct fiscal/ tax incentive introduced in this budget, some support has been provided with an extensive focus on development of ‘industrial parks’ in nearly 100 cities under the ‘plug and play’ model. Reforms proposed with respect to land administration, planning and management, shall also ease out acquisition related difficulties often faced by entrepreneurs/ business houses in acquiring lands for manufacturing set-ups.Targeted Customs duty interventions like, rationalization of Customs duty provisions in Mobile phone manufacturing setups, extension of Customs duty exemption on import of capital goods for manufacturing of solar cells and panels, full Customs duty exemption on import of 25 critical minerals,, shall provide the required impetus for enhancing domestic manufacturing environment.Governments’ focus on formulating an Economic Policy Framework to set the scope for next-gen reforms in the country, has a target to improve the productivity of factors of production, namely, land, labour, capital, entrepreneurship and technology. This shall pave the way for enabling achievement of a target of 25% manufacturing sector contribution to the nation’s GDP over the course of next 7-10 years.While the overall outlook is positive, the extension of tax benefits under Section 115BAB for manufacturing entities and the absence of new PLI schemes are notable omissions.The country’s manufacturing base is expanding as is reflective from the continuously increasing tax collections and expanding Purchasing Manager’s Index. It would be pertinent to see how the ground realities evolve vis-à-vis the vision envisaged, in the upcoming Financial Year.","The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth.

Budget 2024: Armed with the vision to propel India to become a developed country by 2047, the Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business thereby providing the required stimulus to the manufacturing sector and enabling large scale job creation.On the Indirect tax front, the industry welcomes the much-needed announcement for a comprehensive review of the rate structure under Customs enabling ease in product classification and dispute reduction.The proposal of lowering of Customs duty on a plethora of raw materials and products including solar cells, critical minerals and bullion are encouraging measures. The rationale behind such reduction clearly indicates support towards domestic manufacturing, deepening value addition and supporting targets in reducing carbon footprint.Relevant amendments under the Customs law have been made to provide increased time limits for re-imports and re-exports to enhance competitiveness of the fledgling MRO sector. The government has extended significant duty reduction and exemption benefits to the healthcare and electronics sectors, continuing the impetus of incentives provided under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme.Since their introduction in March 2020, the PLI schemes have indeed supported in revitalizing the manufacturing sector and strengthening the necessary supply chains. The success achieved in the mobile manufacturing sector has now enabled the Government to reduce customs duties on mobile phones and components, signalling a mature environment. The Budget proposals aim at reproducing similar outcomes for semiconductor and pharmaceutical industry by increasing the budgetary allocation.Buoyed by the increasing revenue collection under GST signalling a shift towards a mature tax regime, this Budget has harmonized the timeframes for the issuance of demand notices and adjudication orders for cases involving fraud, suppression or otherwise. Significant amendments to the GST legislations have been introduced reflecting the recommendations proposed by the GST Council such as regularizing non-levy of GST due to general practice which may turn out to be a breather for certain impacted industries reeling under huge tax demands.The Insurance sector has been provided much relief through the GST council recommendations which have been cemented in the present budget thereby ending long standing disputes on their business practices.The Government's efforts to push forward with its reform agenda are evident as plans to incentivize states for their business reform actions plans and digitalization through the Jan Vishwas Bill 2.0 is proposed. Further, setting up of e-commerce export hubs is envisaged to facilitate easier access to international markets for domestic players.The recent implementation of Budget proposals allows the government to maintain momentum in its reform agenda. These policy measures implicitly reaffirm the significance of India Inc as a crucial element in the development of infrastructure. However, there are still some expectations required to be met to march towards a Viksit Bharat 2047.",The Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business.

Budget 2024 : Real estate, a significant contributor to employment generation, has received a fair bit of attention in Budget 2024-25. Recent years have seen the sector transform rapidly, driven by factors such as favourable government policies, Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, strong economic growth and changing consumer preferences.Added to that, the budgetary focus on job creation, skilling and employment-linked incentives, infrastructure, urban development, rural connectivity, digitalisation and land-related norms, all dovetail to promote growth of the sector.Launched in June 2015, the PMAY aims to provide affordable housing to all eligible beneficiaries. The budget unveiled PMAY Urban 2.0, under which the housing needs of 1 crore urban poor and middle class will be addressed with an investment of Rs 10 lakh crore.The central government’s additional Rs 2.2 lakh crore injection in the next 5 years to make housing more affordable has the potential to revitalise the affordable housing market.Such an approach can play an important role in realising the government's vision of Housing for All and push growth and development. Hence, the significant investment under PMAY Urban 2.0 is expected to alleviate urban housing deficits, spurring construction and economic growth.Steps to introduce technological reforms within the regulatory framework for land, such as digitalisation or GIS mapping of land records, will improve transparency.Rationalisation of stamp duty across states will also be critical to bring in uniformity and initiate land-related reforms such as urban planning, usage and building bylaws.These are steps in the right direction and will boost growth. Moreover, they will improve the ease of property transactions and strengthen municipal finances through increased property taxes. Rationalization of stamp duty with an emphasis on women homebuyers may boost home-buyer sentiment in major cities, too.The budget has also given ample attention to urban and rural development, with rental housing for industrial workers through the public private partnership model, interest subsidies for rental housing, and transit-oriented developments.The proposal to develop investment-ready plug-and-play industrial parks in 100 cities may attract industrial investment, leading to increased demand for industrial real estate and support the growth of ancillary services and residential developments in these regions.Initiatives for industrial parks and rental housing for industrial workers align with the country’s manufacturing goals and addresses worker accommodation needs.These steps are expected to promote industrial growth and stability in labour-intensive sectors, while also creating new opportunities for real estate developers specialising in rental and affordable housing.The changes in long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax, however, have evoked a mixed reaction. The government lowered the long-term capital gains tax from 20% to 12.5%, which is a welcome step. However, this came with the removal of the indexation benefit.The changes could encourage more liquidity in property transactions and potentially increase the effective tax burden depending on the property’s acquisition date.The launch of Phase IV of the PM Gram Sadak Yojana in 25,000 rural habitations will improve connectivity in rural areas, promoting rural development and making these regions more accessible for investment. The primary objective of PMGSY is to build robust, all-weather roads in rural habitations. This initiative focuses on enhancing connectivity and supporting economic development in rural areas.In essence, the budget is geared towards stimulating growth and investment in the real estate sector , fostering a more transparent and investor-friendly environment, and contributing to overall development. It aims to create a balanced and inclusive growth environment by addressing the needs of various segments, including affordable housing, industrial workers and urban infrastructure.The effectiveness of the initiatives, however, hinges on their implementation and continued support of complementary reforms.","The budget unveiled PMAY Urban 2.0, under which the housing needs of 1 crore urban poor and middle class will be addressed with an investment of Rs 10 lakh crore.

New Budget 2024 rule: Why Income Tax Department is likely to issue a huge number of tax notices this month,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-budget-2024-rule-why-income-tax-department-is-likely-to-issue-a-huge-number-of-tax-notices-this-month/articleshow/112186079.cms,"Taxing Times

Income Tax Notice on the way? The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month, as there are concerns that many taxpayers might escape the tax net due to the impending implementation of the new reassessment law on September 1, 2024.According to the amended regulation announced in Budget 2024 , the tax authorities can only go back a maximum of five years to reassess a taxpayer's records if the escaped income is at least Rs 50 lakh, and three years for an amount less than Rs 50 lakh.Previously, they could reassess cases up to 10 years old.According to an ET report, tax officials are now faced with the challenge of compiling and corroborating data on tax and income mismatches for the financial years 2013-14 to 2017-18 within the next few weeks, as these years will become time-barred for reassessment from September 1, 2024.The I-T department relies on information from various sources, such as banks, property registrars, and search findings from the investigation wing, to build reassessment cases.A tax officers' body has raised concerns about the feasibility of issuing notices under Section 148 (or 148A) in a large number of cases within a single month, given the overburdened nature of the jurisdictional assessing officers and the time-consuming process of obtaining sanction from the chief commissioner, who is the specified authority for such notices.Moreover, the law provides taxpayers with the right to explain their position before reassessment orders are finalized, a process that most believe cannot be completed by the end of August.Also Read | ITR refund status for FY 2023-24: How to check income tax refund status online - here’s a step-by-step guide for incometax.gov.in & NSDL websites The Central Board of Direct Taxes ( CBDT ) has been urged by its officers to postpone the effective date of the proposed amendment. However, this suggestion is unlikely to be well-received by corporations and high net worth individuals.""Capping the reassessment period at five years was a great decision as it would reduce hassles and litigation. But if the department fears there could be a genuine loss of revenue as it may not be possible to wrap up several matters by August 31, the government can think of strict parameters where time-bound cases can be selectively reopened - based on trails of steps taken in identifying escaped income,"" said Mitil Chokshi, partner at CA firm Chokshi & Chokshi.""Taxpayers may expect a rush of reassessment notices in August 2024. These notices are likely to be for the AYs 2018-19 and prior to that. It is pertinent to note that the Bombay High Court in a recent ruling in a case of Hexaware Technologies has taken a view on a proviso introduced in 2021, which can be interpreted to mean that AY 2017-18 (and prior years) got time barred on March 31, 2024. These reassessment notices (for AYs 2017-18 and prior) are likely to rake up new interpretation issues in the already muddled reassessment provisions,"" said Ashish Mehta, partner at law firm Khaitan & Co.The current situation is similar to the conflict between the Income Tax office and taxpayers in 2021. The reassessment law was amended in April 2021, allowing the tax office to reopen 10-year-old tax returns if the total undisclosed income exceeded Rs 50 lakh and reassess 4-year-old matters if the amount was less than Rs 50 lakh.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? However, this change led to over 10,000 writ petitions being filed by companies, arguing that they were not given sufficient time to explain and that the notices were issued without considering the carve-out that cases which couldn't be reopened earlier couldn't be reassessed under the new law.The Supreme Court invoked its extraordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution on May 4, 2022, to uphold all reassessment notices issued after March 31, 2021. However, the court left room for judicial proceedings based on the merits of each case, and several such matters are currently pending before the court.","The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month.

Are NPS Vatsalya & hiked NPS deduction limit for private sector employees good moves from Budget 2024?

NPS and EPF: Overlapping services

What is NPS Vatsalaya?

Latest NPS rules, news: In the Union Budget 2024 speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced two new initiatives with regard to National Pension Scheme (NPS) - extension of NPS 14% employer contribution benefits to private setcor and the intended launch of NPS Vatsalya.Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries, bringing it at par with the provisions available for government employees.Sriram Iyer, CEO, HDFC Pension Management told ET that with this move the “ground rules have been harmonised among government and non-government employees, which is a positive step.”Effectively, this means that now, private-sector employees can choose to reduce the taxable portion of employers’ contribution to their NPS corpus, thereby paying less tax and leaving greater funds in their pension deposits.“Employees will benefit from tax savings . More importantly, the 40% increase in contribution will have a significant impact on the terminal value of the retirement corpus,” remarked Iyer. The extended savings will “help in retirement planning, working as an option that is at par with the Provident Fund,” Dinesh Rohira, CEO & Founder, 5nance.com was quoted as saying.Moreover, the endeavour aims to increase NPS penetration by increasing tax incentives for the private sector, providing them a social security-cushion post-retirement.The scheme’s motive to widen the NPS subscriber base may not prove to be flawlessly effective, however. This is explained by Agrees Mrin Agarwal, Founder, Finsafe India: “While it’s good that the limit has been raised, it may not increase adoption as employees need to be educated in a big way. Also, the benefit is only for the salaried opting for the new tax regime,” she says.The mandatory contribution to the EPF, too, threatens to relegate the provisions of NPS under the umbrella of near-superfluity. This sentiment is echoed by Varun Sahay, a software engineer in a Delhi-based IT company: “When 12% of my salary is already deducted for the EPF, why should I put in more in the NPS and cut my take-home pay?”Rohira feels otherwise. “There’s no competition between the NPS and EPF as employees can contribute to both and build a 3-4 times bigger corpus while earning 3-4% higher returns via marketlinked options in the NPS,” he counters.Also Check | New Tax Regime 2023 vs 2024 After Budget: How Much Income Tax Will Salaried Taxpayers Save & How Do New Tax Slabs Compare To Old Regime? Top 10 Points You Must Know To jumpstart retirement savings for children, a new initiative called NPS Vatsalya has been unveiled in the Budget. This scheme allows parents and guardians to contribute to a minor's account, which can be converted into a regular NPS account once the child reaches adulthood.""It provides a very long duration for reaping the compounding benefits and accumulating a huge bounty at a later age. This can be a good way to plan a better future for kids who may not opt for a service segment in the future,"" says Rohira. Sriram Iyer agrees, stating, ""It’s a good move to help the child start his retirement journey. Even if a parent starts when the child is 10 years old, by the time he starts working, it can be a solid foundation for the compounding journey after that.""However, some experts question the utility of a product with such a long lock-in period, especially when parents cannot use the funds for essential goals like their child’s education amidst soaring education costs of 11-12%.""Parents are struggling to save for their own retirement, so it might be a bit of a stretch to expect them to save for their kids’ retirement. The need of the hour is a market-linked product that allows withdrawals only for the child’s education,"" says Mrin Agarwal, Founder of Finsafe India.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? Though the NPS permits partial withdrawals, it allows only 25% of the corpus after three years of joining, and this can be done only three times during the entire tenure. A premature exit before 60 years with 100% withdrawal is only possible if the corpus is less than Rs.2.5 lakh, an amount insufficient for most children's goals.""In its current form, there won’t be any uptake,"" asserts Agarwal. Rohira concurs, ""It’s a vanilla product with a lock-in, which does not make it very attractive and it may not take off. However, the government may optimise it and introduce new features later."" Iyer adds, ""This is just a start and there may be more subscriber-friendly features as we take it to the market. The regulator is proactive and open to feedback.""","Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries.

Gold import duty cut: Why Indians may not find buying gold from Dubai as attractive post Budget 2024,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-import-duty-cut-why-indians-may-not-find-buying-gold-from-dubai-as-attractive-post-budget-2024/articleshow/112097671.cms,"Gold import duty cut in Budget 2024: The recent reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai. Indian jewellers with stores in both India and the UAE believe that the narrowed duty differential will result in lower gold prices in India, making it less attractive for Indians to purchase gold in Dubai.The emirate had attracted gold-enthusiast Indians following a steep rise in customs duty in India in July 2022. In the fiscal 2024-25 budget, the duty on gold imports was more than halved.The duty cut is also expected to boost gold jewellery production in India, particularly the popular 'Kolkatti' jewellery from Kolkata, which is favored by Indian expats in Dubai and tourists from various countries. This move will encourage gold artisans to create new designs in both heavyweight and lightweight jewellery, attracting consumers to purchase gold from India.According to an ET report, Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group , estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India as Indian tourists who previously bought jewellery in Dubai will now prefer to shop in India. However, Indian expats living in Dubai and other customers may continue to buy from the UAE.Also Read | Gold losing sheen?

He points out that the labour cost is significantly lower in India, and with the introduction of mandatory hallmarking and HUID numbers, the purity of gold in India is no longer a concern.Furthermore, NRIs in Dubai do not receive VAT refunds, and Indians travelling abroad only receive about 60% of the VAT back on their gold purchases. Gold trade analyst Bhargav Baidya suggests that the 1% duty differential between gold jewellery in India and Dubai will be offset by Indian jewellers offering discounts to retain and attract customers.Saurabh Gadgil, chairman of PNG Jewellers, notes that Indian import duty is now on par with the US, allowing Indian jewellers to offer competitive prices compared to other countries worldwide. The reduced customs duty is expected to make gold purchases in India more attractive and convenient for Indian consumers, potentially leading to a significant shift in their gold shopping preferences.",The reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai.

Gold losing sheen? The government has reduced its target for issuing gold bonds in the financial year 2024-25 by 38% compared to the previous interim budget goal, according to a senior official. The revised target stands at Rs 18,500 crore, down from Rs 29,638 crore estimated in the interim budget and Rs 26,852 crore (revised estimate) in 2023-24.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told ET ""The decision followed a reassessment of various factors, including investor demand, other investment products and uncertainties around the global economy, as the situation has changed since the interim budget in February.""After accounting for redemptions, the net issuances of sovereign gold bonds are now estimated at Rs 15,000 crore for this fiscal year, a significant decrease from the Rs 26,138 crore projected in the interim budget and Rs 25,352 crore in the revised estimate for 2023-24.Harish Galipelli, director at ILA Commodities India, attributed this shift to retail investors increasingly opting for equities in anticipation of better returns. He also noted that people are uncertain about the potential for further increases in gold prices in the short-to-medium term following a recent rally. Additionally, Galipelli pointed out that savings in rural areas have been impacted by retail inflation and other factors.The gold bond and gold monetisation schemes were introduced by the government in late 2015 to discourage the physical purchase of precious metals and reduce imports, thereby mitigating the negative impact on the current account deficit.The gross collection through these two schemes is now projected to be Rs 20,030 crore in 2024-25, compared to Rs 31,168 crore in the interim budget and Rs 28,240 crore (revised estimate) in the previous fiscal year. Similarly, the net collection is estimated at Rs 16,433 crore, down from Rs 27,571 crore in the interim budget and Rs 26,653 crore in the previous year.

TOI

Wednesday’s 50 basis points rate cut decision by the US Federal Reserve may not prompt an immediate response from RBI in its Oct policy, though it could benefit India by easing pressure on the rupee and lowering borrowing costs for those with access to global markets.In the equity market, the rate cut at the upper end of the 25-50 basis points (100 bps = 1 percentage point) is expected to force investors to be cautious, with the sharp cut being an indication that the US economy may be weakening faster than what is visible now.The 50 bps rate cut has been the first one in over four years.“The Fed’s move is expected and may slightly reduce bond yields, as it has been largely factored in. RBI will focus on controlling inflation and is unlikely to react unless inflation falls on a sustainable basis. A lower Fed rate will slightly weaken the dollar, which will help stabilise the rupee,” Madan Sabnavis, chief economist at Bank of Baroda , said.SBI chairman C S Setty echoed this view, saying, “Central banks are making independent decisions. While the Fed cut influences everyone, RBI will focus on food inflation before deciding on an interest rate cut . We believe a rate cut may not happen this year and could be delayed until Q4 (Jan-Mar 2025) unless food inflation improves significantly.”According to Macquarie Research, NBFCs could benefit from a US rate cut, but banks’ performance depends more on non-performing asset cycles than on a cut in interest rates.Among equity fund managers, according to Taher Badshah, CIO, Invesco Mutual Fund, the 50 bps cut by the Fed is ahead of much of the street’s expectations of a 25 bps cut and should spur a strong initial positive surprise to the market. “However, this aggressive start to the rate cut cycle may leave investors more concerned about the extent of the USeconomic slowdown and eventually hurt sentiments.”Anish Tawakley, CO-CIO Equity, ICICI Prudential MF, however has a contrarian view. “The US 10-year bond yield is more relevant to the Indian equity market than the Fed’s overnight rate. Even with a 50 bps rate cut, I don’t expect the 10-year yield to fall significantly…(on the contrary) it may even rise.”Tawakley, who manages about Rs 1 lakh crore worth of funds, said that US 10-year bond yields — which are already down to 3.7% — are pricing in expectations of several rate cuts over the next 18 months. “However, with the US economy still in reasonably good shape, growing rather than contracting, fewer cuts may be needed, and bond yields could move higher in the coming months.” And for the Indian equity markets, a rise in the US 10-year yield may signal a more cautious outlook ahead, he told","The 50 bps rate cut has been the first one in over four years.

YSRC had reacted angrily, denying the allegations and claiming it to be one of Naidu’s political stunts.The analysis by the Centre for Analysis and Learning in Livestock and Food (CALF) of the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB), however comes with a caveat - there can be chances of false positive results in certain circumstances. The report lists several conditions where a result could go wrong, including in cases like overfeeding cows with feed rich in vegetable oils, underfeeding cows or the milk being subjected to technological treatments like removal of cholesterol.The report is silent whether the adulterants were deliberately added or crept in through feeding conditions and other factors.Naidu’s allegation and the NDDB’s report have shocked millions of devotees of Lord Venkateswara across the globe as the Tirupati laddus are considered Maha Prasadam and carry a high sentimental value.The TDP govt had in June appointed senior IAS officer J Syamala Rao as the new executive officer of the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) which manages the temple complex. As part of streamlining measures, an inquiry was ordered into the alleged poor quality, taste and texture of the laddus.TTD constituted an expert committee to look into the quality of the prasadam. The members included Dr B Surendranth, former principal scientist of the National Dairy Research Institute, Vijayawada, Bhaskar Reddy (dairy expert), Prof B Mahadevan (IIM-Bangalore) and Dr G Swarnalatha from the Telangana Veterinary UniversityApart from suggesting several measures to TTD to restore the taste and quality, the committee also sent samples of the ghee to NDDB, Gujarat. The lab reports, issued in July, confirmed the presence of foreign fats. TTD returned the ghee stocks supplied by AR Dairy Foods, Dindigul, in Tamil Nadu and blacklisted the contractor. Then, TTD selected Karnataka Milk Federation to supply the ghee.TTD sources said that while cow ghee was procured from the blacklisted contractor at Rs 320 per kg, the Tirupati trust is now procuring ghee at Rs 475 per kg from the Karnataka federation.TTD prepares and distributes about 3 lakh laddus to the devotees every day at Tirumala.

White House invests over $3 Billion to boost US electric vehicle battery production,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/white-house-invests-over-3-billion-to-boost-us-electric-vehicle-battery-production/articleshow/113521696.cms,"The White House on Friday allocated more than $3 billion to American companies to increase domestic production of advanced batteries and other materials used in electric vehicles The grants will support 25 projects across 14 states, including key battleground states such as Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio, Texas, South Carolina, and Louisiana. This funding is part of an ongoing initiative to decrease China's global dominance in battery production for EVs and other electronic devices.This marks the second round of EV battery funding under the bipartisan infrastructure law passed in 2021, following an initial round that provided $1.8 billion for 14 ongoing projects. The total amounts are lower than those announced in October 2022, reflecting the withdrawal or rejection of some projects during the negotiation process between companies and US officials.The funding is a crucial component of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris's broader strategy to accelerate the production and adoption of electric vehicles, which they see as essential for mitigating climate change and strengthening US manufacturing. The companies receiving these awards are involved in processing lithium, graphite, and other battery materials, as well as manufacturing components used in EV batteries.""Today's awards move us closer to achieving the administration's goal of building an end-to-end supply chain for batteries and critical minerals here in America, from mining to processing to manufacturing and recycling, which is vital to reduce China's dominance of this critical sector,"" said White House economic adviser Lael Brainard.The Biden-Harris administration remains dedicated to producing batteries in the United States that will be essential for powering the nation's grid, homes, businesses, and the iconic American auto industry.Brainard further said that the US government has announced nearly $35 billion in investments to strengthen the country's critical minerals and battery supply chains. These investments span from lithium mines in Nevada and North Carolina to battery factories in Michigan and Ohio, as well as the production of rare earth elements and magnets in California and Texas.Brainard emphasized that the administration is utilizing various tools, including grants, loans, and allocated tax credits, to support these initiatives. She noted that the administration's approach has attracted over $100 billion in private sector investment since President Biden took office.In recent years, China has dominated the processing and refining of key minerals such as lithium, rare earth elements, and gallium, as well as battery production, leaving the US and its allies ""vulnerable"", according to Brainard. In response, the US has taken ""tough, targeted measures to enforce against unfair actions by China"", including higher tariffs on Chinese imports of critical minerals and restrictions on products from China and other adversaries labeled as foreign entities of concern by the US.""We're committed to making batteries in the United States of America,"" said Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm.The awards announced on Friday, if finalized, will support 25 projects, creating 8,000 construction jobs and over 4,000 permanent jobs. Companies receiving grants will be required to match the funding on a 50-50 basis, with a minimum investment of $50 million, according to the Energy Department.Matthew McDowell, an associate professor of engineering at Georgia Institute of Technology, noted that while federal funding may not be crucial for all projects, the influx of cash from the infrastructure and climate laws has significantly transformed the US battery manufacturing sector in recent years. McDowell expressed excitement about the next generation of batteries for clean energy storage, including solid state batteries, which have the potential to hold more energy than lithium ion batteries.","The grants will support 25 projects across 14 states, including key battleground states such as Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio, Texas, South Carolina, and Louisiana. This funding is part of an ongoing initiative to decrease China's global dominance in battery production for EVs and other electronic devices.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113522190,imgsize-644329,width-400,resizemode-4/113522190.jpg"

Declining sales and failure to evolve: How Tupperware found itself in crisis,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/declining-sales-and-failure-to-evolve-how-tupperware-found-itself-in-crisis/articleshow/113489961.cms,"Tupperware Goes Bankrupt: How The Colourful Tiffin Box Maker Lost Its Vibe I Explained

Tupperware Brands , the company known for its iconic colourful food storage containers , filed for bankruptcy protection in Delaware on Tuesday. The company has been reportedly struggling with mounting losses due to declining demand for its products in recent years.In the 1950s, Tupperware experienced a surge in popularity as women of the post-war generation held ""Tupperware parties"" at their homes to sell the containers, seeking empowerment and independence.However, the company has faced challenges in recent years as it struggled to place its products in retail stores and online sales platforms. Tupperware has traditionally relied on independent sales representatives to sell its products, but this strategy has failed to reach modern consumers, according to Brian Fox, Tupperware's chief restructuring officer, who said in a court filing, ""Nearly everyone now knows what Tupperware is, but fewer people know where to find it.""Financial analysts also criticized Tupperware in recent years for sticking with the direct sales model and failing to evolve with the times.Despite efforts to turn its business around, Tupperware has been facing challenges for years, reporting several quarters of falling sales. The post-Covid circumstances intensified these challenges. Initially, Tupperware saw a boost in sales as Americans turned to home cooking during the pandemic. Yet, as the world reopened, the company faced a sharp rise in labour, freight, and raw material costs—particularly for plastic resin. These increasing expenses, coupled with a failure to adapt its sales strategy, have resulted in several quarters of falling sales.Tupperware has been grappling with liquidity constraints and has raised doubts about its ability to remain in business. News agency Reuters reported that the company has $812 million in debt, much of which was purchased by distressed debt investors at a deep discount in July. These new lenders sought to use their debt position to seize Tupperware assets, including its intellectual property such as its brand, pushing the company to seek bankruptcy protection.Tupperware intends to continue operations and conduct a 30-day bidding process to find a buyer for the entire company.According to bankruptcy filings, Tupperware has estimated assets of $500 million to $1 billion and estimated liabilities of $1 billion to $10 billion. The company has listed the number of creditors to be between 50,001 and 100,000. In 2023, Tupperware finalized an agreement with its lenders to restructure its debt obligations and engaged investment bank Moelis & Co to help explore strategic options.","Tupperware Brands, the company known for its iconic colourful food storage containers, filed for bankruptcy protection on Tuesday.

US stocks dip despite larger Fed interest rate cut,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-stocks-dip-despite-larger-fed-interest-rate-cut/articleshow/113473355.cms,"On Wednesday, Wall Street stocks experienced a slight decline following the Federal Reserve's announcement of a half-percentage-point interest rate cut. The central bank's chair, Jerome Powell , assured a ""careful"" approach to lowering rates, acknowledging the progress made in combating inflation in the United States.The Federal Reserve's decision was supported by an 11-to-1 vote in favor of reducing the benchmark rate to a range between 4.75 percent and 5.00 percent.The larger-than-expected rate cut surprised some analysts who had anticipated a quarter-point decrease. Additionally, policymakers projected an extra half-point of cuts by the end of this year and a further percentage point of cuts in 2025.Meanwhile, major US stock indices fluctuated between positive and negative territory following the Fed's decision. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 103.08 points, or 0.25%, to 41,503.10, the S&P 500 lost 16.32 points, or 0.29%, to 5,618.26 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 54.76 points, or 0.31%, to 17,573.30. Briefing.com noted that the Fed's decision would be met ""with both elation and criticism,"" as the larger rate cut could appease those who believe the Fed is lagging in preventing a hard landing. However, it may also face criticism from those who think the more aggressive rate cut was unwarranted given broader economic trends, with concerns that it could reignite inflation.During a news conference, Powell described the US economy as being in ""good shape,"" highlighting lower inflation and robust growth. He emphasized the Fed's desire to maintain a strong labor market. The decision to implement a larger rate cut was based on various economic data points, leading policymakers to conclude that monetary decisions had been ""appropriately restrictive"" and that a ""more neutral"" approach was now necessary. Powell signaled that investors should expect more interest rate cuts in the future but cautioned that the central bank would proceed carefully and evaluate the matter ""meeting by meeting.""In Europe, stock markets in Paris and London closed lower, while Frankfurt ended the day flat. The dollar initially experienced a significant drop against the euro and other currencies but later recovered. The Fed now anticipates only a half-percentage point of cuts remaining in 2024, which is lower than the three-quarter percentage point that traders had been expecting. Traders are now focusing on the upcoming announcement by the Bank of England on Thursday.

Wednesday's decisive move highlights the growing concern among policymakers over the employment landscape .""The committee has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2%, and judges that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals are roughly in balance,"" the Fed said in a statement, adding that officials are ""strongly committed to supporting maximum employment"" in addition to bringing inflation back to their goal.Policymakers pencilled in an additional percentage point of cuts in 2025, according to their median forecast.Governor Michelle Bowman dissented in favour of a smaller, quarter-point cut, the first dissent by a governor since 2005, and the first dissent from any member of the FOMC since 2022.In their statement, policymakers said they will consider ""additional adjustments"" to rates based on ""incoming data, the evolving outlook and the balance of risks."" They also noted that inflation ""remains somewhat elevated"" and job gains have slowed. The central bank raised rates 11 times, bringing its benchmark to a two-decade high in July 2023.Since then, inflation has cooled considerably and - at 2.5% - is nearing the Fed's 2% target. And while the labour market has weakened, there's no clear indication the US economy is in recession or on the cusp of falling into one. Layoffs remain low, consumers are still spending and economic growth is strong.Still, there are growing signs of strain. Excess savings that helped support Americans in recent years have run dry, and delinquency rates are rising. An increase in job losses could trigger a pullback in spending and slow the economy. The muddied economic picture has increased uncertainty and spurred divisions among Fed officials over the best path forward for policy.Some are anxious to curb labour-market weakness before it spirals into more pain. Others worry that cutting rates too quickly may reignite demand and keep inflation elevated.","The Federal Open Market Committee voted 11 to 1 to lower the federal funds rate to a range of 4.75% to 5%.

Wall Street holds near records after Fed delivers a big cut to rates,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/wall-street-holds-near-records-after-fed-delivers-a-big-cut-to-rates/articleshow/113468971.cms,"NEW YORK: Wall Street is holding near its records on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve kicked off its efforts to prevent a recession with a bigger-than-usual cut to interest rates .The S&P 500 was virtually flat in late trading and 0.6% below its all-time high set in July. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 31 points, or 0.1%, and close to its record set on Monday.The Nasdaq composite was 0.2% higher, as of 3:35 p.m. Eastern time.The momentous move by the Fed helps financial markets in two big ways. It eases the brakes off the economy, which has been slowing under the weight of higher rates, and it gives a boost to prices for all kinds of investments. Besides stocks, gold and bond prices had already rallied in recent months on expectations that cuts to rates were coming.Because the move was so well telegraphed, and markets had already climbed so much in anticipation of it, Wall Street's reactions were relatively muted despite the Fed's historic action. It marked the first cut to the federal funds rate in over four years, and it closed the door on a stretch where the Fed kept the rate at a two-decade high to slow the economy enough to stifle the worst inflation in generations.Now that inflation has eased significantly from its peak two summers ago and appears to be heading toward 2%, the Fed says it it can turn more of its attention toward protecting the slowing job market and overall economy.""The time to support the labor market is when it's strong and not when you begin to see the layoffs,"" Fed Chair Jerome Powell said. ""That's the situation we're in.""The only question is how much the Fed will ultimately cut rates by to do so, which can prove to be a tricky balance. Lowering rates would help the economy by making it easier for US businesses and households to borrow. But it could also offer more fuel for inflation.The Fed released forecasts Wednesday that said its median official expects to cut the federal funds rate by another half of a percentage point through the end of the year. That could mean a traditional-sized cut of a quarter of a percentage point at each of its two remaining meetings scheduled for 2024.After that, the median Fed official is projecting another full percentage point of cuts during 2025.Some critics say the Federal Reserve may be moving too late to protect the economy after having kept rates too high for too long.""When the Fed is behind the curve, it sometimes takes a big move to catch up to where they should have been all along,"" said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management.""We don't think we're behind,"" Powell said in a press conference following the Fed's announcement. ""We think this is timely. But I think you can take this as a sign of our commitment not to get behind,"" pointing to Wednesday's hefty cut of half a percentage point. Powell called it a ""good strong start to this.""Other critics, meanwhile, are saying the Fed will need to be careful about cutting rates too much because of the possibility that inflation will remain stubbornly higher than it's been in recent decades.Powell repeated several times that the Fed does not feel ""a rush to get this done"" and will make its decisions on interest rates at each successive meeting, depending on what incoming data say.""We'll move as fast or as slow as we think is appropriate in real time,"" he said. For now, he said, ""the US economy is in a good place, and our decision today is designed to keep it there.""Treasury yields squiggled down and up immediately after the Fed announced its cut and published its projections.The 10-year Treasury yield eventually rose to 3.70% from 3.65% late Tuesday. The two-year yield, which more closely follows expectations for Fed action, edged up to 3.62% from 3.60% late Tuesday.On Wall Street, stocks of oil-and-gas producers and other companies whose profits are most closely tied to the strength of the economy helped lead the way. Utilities and other dividend-paying stocks that tend to hold up better during economic downturns, meanwhile, lagged behind the market.That could be a signal that Wall Street sees lower odds of painful recession following the Fed's cut, according to Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute.Intuitive Machines soared 40% after Nasa awarded it with a contract worth up to $4.82 billion for communication and navigation services the space agency will use to establish a long-term presence on the moon.Trading in Tupperware Brands remained halted after the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.

Bowman’s opposition denied Fed Chair Jerome Powell a unanimous decision at a critical juncture, as the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 50 basis points.Bowman favored a more modest quarter-point cut, while the other 11 voting members supported the half-point reduction. Out of the Fed's 19 policymakers, only 12 cast votes on rate decisions, including the seven members of the Fed Board and the president of the New York Fed. The remaining 11 Fed presidents rotate in voting every year.Dissents from Fed governors were more common prior to 1995, but since then, the majority of the 90-plus dissents have come from Fed presidents. Fed chairs, including Powell, typically seek consensus to maintain credibility, often reaching compromises to avoid open disagreement. However, dissents are not unheard of, particularly at key moments in monetary policy . During the pandemic, unanimous decisions were more frequent, but Powell acknowledged that differences of opinion are a normal part of the process.Bowman’s dissent was a notable one, as she has become one of the more hawkish voices at the Fed, consistently advocating for higher interest rates to fully combat inflation. Her call for a quarter-point cut reflected her concerns about easing too quickly. This marks the first hawkish dissent from a Fed governor in nearly 30 years.While financial markets largely expected a half-point cut ahead of the meeting, Bowman's dissent underscores the balancing act the Fed faces. Dissenters, such as Kansas City Fed President Esther George in 2022, have historically marked significant moments in Fed decision-making. As ING economist James Knightley noted, such disagreements suggest ""tough discussions"" are taking place within the central bank.Bowman has also diverged from the majority on regulatory matters, advocating for a lighter approach to bank regulation. Her dissent on Wednesday continues her pattern of pushing for a stricter stance on inflation, even as the majority of her colleagues support easing monetary policy.",Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman was the first governor to vote against an interest-rate decision since 2005.

US Federal Reserve cuts interest rates by 50 bps in key FOMC meet chaired by Jerome Powell,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-federal-reserve-rate-cut-fomc-meet-september-18-2024-jerome-powell-key-highlights/articleshow/113465996.cms,"US Federal Reserve Rate Cut: Key Points

The Fed delivered a half-of-a-percentage-point cut as part of the expected 100 basis-point reduction for the year.

The US Federal Reserve's latest economic projections, released on Wednesday following its Sept. 17-18 meeting, indicate that central bankers expect to reduce interest rates to a range of 4.25%-4.50% by the end of the year. This projection range is lower than what they had anticipated in June, as inflation moves closer to their 2% target and unemployment increases.

The Fed's current target range for its short-term borrowing benchmark stands at 4.75%-5.00%, and the projections suggest that policymakers anticipate quarter-point rate cuts at the remaining two meetings this year, scheduled for November and December.

Looking further ahead, the median Fed policymaker projects a policy rate of 3.4% by the end of 2025, implying an additional four quarter-of-a-percentage-point cuts in 2024.

The policy rate is expected to reach 2.9% by the end of both 2026 and 2027, indicating a return to what the median Fed policymaker now considers a neutral rate.

These projections represent a shift from the Fed's June projections, which had anticipated only one quarter-point reduction in all of 2024. The change in outlook comes as inflation has eased from unexpectedly strong readings earlier in the year, while the unemployment rate has risen to 4.2%, more than half a percentage point higher than when the Fed began its rate-hike campaign in March 2022.

The Fed's decision to cut rates was based on the progress made toward its inflation goal and the assessment that the risks to both its mandates are now ""roughly in balance."" However, the decision was not unanimous, with Fed Governor Michelle Bowman dissenting in favor of a smaller quarter-point cut.

It is important to note that the projections represent the views of individual policymakers rather than an agreed consensus. Two of the Fed's 19 policymakers felt that no further rate cuts were necessary this year, while seven believed that only one additional quarter-of-a-percentage point cut would be required. On the other hand, only one policymaker anticipated more rate cuts this year than the median view.

US Federal Reserve Meeting : The US Federal Reserve on Wednesday cut interest rates by 50 basis points. ""In light of the progress on inflation and the balance of risks, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/2 percentage point to 4-3/4 to 5 percent,"" the FOMC statement read.This is the first time in over four years that the US Federal Reserve has cut interest rates.Today’s rate cut starts a cycle to reverse the restrictive conditions that had been imposed to keep inflation in check."" In considering additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage‑backed securities. The Committee is strongly committed to supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to its 2 percent objective,"" the FOMC statement read.Since July 2023, when the central bank last raised interest rates by 25 basis points to a range of 5.25% to 5.50% to address inflation, borrowing costs have remained at their highest levels in over two decades. Recently, however, attention has shifted to a moderating labor market.The latest US economic data shows that job growth, while slowing from the high levels seen during the COVID-19 pandemic, remains in positive territory, according to a Reuters report. Retail sales and industrial production figures released on Tuesday exceeded expectations, and the Atlanta Fed's model, which estimates economic growth based on incoming data, indicates that the economy is currently expanding at a 3.0% annual rate in the third quarter, surpassing the central bank's estimates of the U.S. economy's potential.Following the pandemic, a perfect storm of factors, including goods scarcity, significant spending, labor shortages, large government deficits, and aggressive corporate pricing, pushed inflation to its highest level in 40 years in 2022.Although wage growth was robust and outpaced price increases for many workers, sentiment remained negative for much of the time. The Federal Reserve raised interest rates to slow the economy, which led to higher home mortgage rates and banks tightening credit for various loans and borrowers.The Fed's preferred inflation measure is now just half a percentage point above the central bank's target, and it is expected to gradually decrease throughout the remainder of 2024 and into the following year.Despite the challenges, the economy has performed better than anticipated by nearly all measures.This year, US stock markets have rallied, with all three major indexes reaching record highs due to expectations of lower interest rates as inflation eased and the job market displayed gradual signs of cooling.","US Federal Reserve on Wednesday cut interest rates by 50 basis points.

Why did Tupperware file for bankruptcy?

Tupperware Brands bankruptcy: Tupperware Brands, along with some of its subsidiaries, has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, according to a recent company announcement.The iconic food storage container company has experienced declining sales in recent years, leading to financial difficulties.Tupperware, once synonymous with its airtight plastic containers, has struggled to maintain its popularity among consumers in recent years.An attempt to boost distribution through a partnership with big-box chain Target failed to improve the company's fortunes, according to an AFP report.The company's history dates back to 1946 when chemist Earl Tupper ""had a spark of inspiration while creating molds at a plastics factory shortly after the Great Depression,"" according to Tupperware's website.""If he could design an airtight seal for plastic storage containers, like those on a paint can, he could help war-weary families save money on costly food waste."" Over time, Tupper's hermetically sealed plastic containers became associated with ""Tupperware Parties,"" where friends would gather with food and drink as a company representative demonstrated the items.In 2022, the New York-listed company issued a warning about its ability to continue operating due to its precarious financial situation.Laurie Ann Goldman , the company's president and CEO, attributed Tupperware's financial struggles to the ""challenging macroeconomic environment"" over the past few years.Goldman said, ""As a result, we explored numerous strategic options and determined this is the best path forward.""Tupperware plans to seek court approval for a sale process to safeguard its brand and further its transformation into a ""digital-first, technology-led company.""The Orlando, Florida-based company also intends to request approval to maintain operations during the bankruptcy proceedings, ensuring that employees and suppliers continue to be paid.Goldman reassured customers, saying, ""We plan to continue serving our valued customers with the high-quality products they love and trust throughout this process.""The company's shares have experienced a significant decline, trading at $0.5099 on Monday, a sharp drop from $2.55 in December 2022.Tupperware has implemented a strategic plan to modernize its operations and drive efficiencies to stimulate growth, following the appointment of a new management team last year.The statement said, ""The Company has made significant progress and intends to continue this important transformation work.""In its filing with the US Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, Tupperware reported assets ranging from $500 million to $1 billion and liabilities between $1 billion and $10 billion. The filing also revealed that the company has between 50,000 and 100,000 creditors.","Tupperware, once synonymous with its airtight plastic containers, has struggled to maintain its popularity among consumers.
