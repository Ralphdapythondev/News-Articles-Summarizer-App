Vizhinjam port, India’s largest transhipment port in Kerala, welcomes first mothership; top facts about Adani-built port",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/big-milestone-vizhinjam-port-indias-largest-transhipment-port-in-kerala-welcomes-first-mothership-top-facts-about-adani-built-port/articleshow/111682142.cms,"Why is Vizhinjam port, India's largest transhipment port special?

The Vizhinjam International Sea Port , India's largest transhipment port in Kerala, has welcomed its first container ship, a large cargo vessel named 'San Fernando' from China. The ship's arrival was celebrated with a water salute by four tugs that guided it to the dock, marking a significant milestone for India's largest transhipment port.The ship, with a capacity of 8,000 to 9,000 TEUs, is owned by the prominent shipping company Maersk and arrived from Xiamen Port in China.The 300-meter-long San Fernando is set to unload 1,900 containers at Vizhinjam International Seaport Limited (VISL).The mothership carries large containers that will be transferred to other vessels and subsequently transported to various ports within the country and internationally.Vizhinjam, equipped with state-of-the-art equipment and advanced automation and IT systems, is poised to become India's first semi-automated port.Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd (APSEZ) is responsible for the development of the Vizhinjam International Seaport. Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan acknowledged Adani Group's commitment to completing the project within the stipulated timeframe.The port's construction, which commenced in 2016, is a public-private partnership project with a total investment of Rs 8,867 crore. The Kerala state government contributed approximately Rs 5,595 crore, while the central government provided Rs 818 crore towards the port's development. It is expected to be fully commissioned in September or October 2024.The port boasts natural depths ranging from 20 to 24 meters, with a rare rocky ocean bottom, eliminating the need for dredging to achieve such depths.Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan officially greeted the Chinese freight ship 'San Fernando' at the Vizhinjam international sea port on Friday, a day after the vessel had docked. The event was attended by several dignitaries, including Sarbananda Sonowal, the Union Minister for Ports, Shipping, and Waterways, and A N Shamseer, the Kerala Assembly Speaker.Also present at the ceremony were V N Vasavan, the state Ports Minister, along with his fellow cabinet members K N Balagopal, V Sivankutty, K Rajan, and G R Anil. M Vincent, a UDF MLA, and Karan Adani, the Managing Director of APSEZ, were among the other notable attendees.Sarbananda Sonowal, the Union Minister of Ports, Shipping & Waterways, expressed his optimism about the arrival of San Fernand at the Vizhinjam International Seaport saying, ""This is a good development in the country. India under the dynamic leadership of PM Modi is going to be one of the leading maritime nations in the world. For that to happen, we have to create world-class facilities here so that all types of vessels can be accommodated at the Indian ports. We are going to develop this kind of port in Maharashtra and Andaman & Nicobar Islands - both at the East and West coast of India to have global access.""","Vizhinjam International Sea Port, India's largest transhipment port in Kerala, has welcomed its first container ship, a large cargo vessel named 'San Fernando' from China.

Budget 2024 expectations : Ahead of the upcoming Union Budget 2024 presentation on July 23 by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman , the government is weighing a proposal to significantly raise the minimum guaranteed amount under its flagship social security initiative , the Atal Pension Yojana (APY).Currently, the scheme offers a guaranteed minimum pension ranging from Rs 1,000 to Rs 5,000 per month, depending on the subscriber's contributions.However, according to an ET report, in a move aimed at enhancing social security benefits, the Modi government is contemplating doubling this amount to Rs 10,000 per month. The decision on this proposal is expected closer to the budget date.The potential hike in APY benefits comes amidst efforts to strengthen India's social security framework, aligning with the imminent rollout of the labour code on social security.As of June 20, the Atal Pension Yojana has garnered over 66.2 million enrolments, with 12.2 million new accounts added in the fiscal year 2023-24 alone.""Some proposals have been made for making the Atal Pension Yojana more attractive, including increasing the guaranteed amount.

Notably, individuals liable to pay income tax are excluded from enrolling in the scheme, reinforcing its focus on supporting economically disadvantaged groups.","The government is weighing a proposal to significantly raise the minimum guaranteed amount under its flagship social security initiative, the Atal Pension Yojana.

Firstly, investment, traditionally supported by domestic savings, is stabilizing and showing signs of acceleration, complemented by a manageable current account deficit and external debt.

Secondly, effective monetary policy and inflation control have achieved macroeconomic and financial stability, which underpins growth prospects. The improving health of the banking sector and ongoing fiscal consolidation further enhance stability.

Thirdly, India's favorable demographics, characterized by a young and expanding workforce, promise sustained growth.

Another growth multiplier is India’s digital revolution. India is emerging as a world leader in leveraging digital technologies for transformative change.

India can be the world’s second largest economy soon? RBI deputy governor Michael Patra says that it is “possible to imagine India striking out into the next decade to become the second largest economy in the world not by 2048, but by 2031 and the largest economy of the world by 2060.”At an address titled, ‘Future Readying India’s Monetary Policy’ at the Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration, Mussoorie, Patra noted that the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) already projects that in PPP terms, India will overtake the US by 2048 to become the second largest economy of the world.However, he sees a possibility of that happening sooner - in the next seven years!Patra highlighted India's inherent strengths and determination to achieve its ambitious targets. He noted that the 'age of China' began in the early 1990s, propelling it to become the second-largest economy globally. However, he emphasized that India's time has arrived, starting from 2010, and several factors are converging to enable India to emerge as a world leader in the next two to three decades.He stated that if India can achieve a growth rate of 9.6% per annum over the next decade, it is estimated that the country will break free from the lower middle-income trap and become a developed economy. ""These gains need to be reflected in per capita income with two milestones – a per capita income level of US$ 4516-14,005 to reach middle income country status, and beyond that level to attain the position of a developed country today,"" he said.","OECD projects India will overtake the US by 2048 to become the second largest economy of the world.

ITR filing FY 2023-24: Confused between old & new tax regime? Top points to consider before filing your income tax return,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/itr-filing-fy-2023-24-confused-between-old-new-tax-regime-top-points-to-consider-before-filing-your-income-tax-return/articleshow/111706558.cms,"By Parizad Sirwalla

Key Features of new tax regime under Income Tax Act, 1961 (‘the Act’) – FY 2023-24

In the Union Budget of 2023, the new tax regime has been made as a default regime. So, the taxpayers will have to expressly opt out of the new tax regime in the tax return form, if they wish to opt for the old regime.

The option to choose either of the tax regime shall be required to be exercised at the time of filing tax return by the individual.

One of the key features and major differences between the old and new tax regime is elimination of most exemptions and deductions under the new tax regime. This includes popular deductions such as Section 80C [up to Rs 1.5 lakhs for investments in instruments like EPF, PPF, ELSS, Life insurance premiums, National Pension System (NPS) etc.], Section 80D (health insurance premiums paid or senior citizen specified medical expenditure), Section 80CCD (1B) for incremental investments in the NPS, House Rent Allowance (HRA) for rent paid, Leave Travel Allowance (LTA), deduction of interest on loan for self-occupied property etc. Loss under the head income from house property for rented house shall not be allowed to be set off under any other head and would also not be allowed to be carried forward.

Certain deductions continue to be available under the new tax regime - like standard deduction of Rs 50,000, deduction for employer contribution to NPS under Section 80CCD(2) of the Act.

No tax payout for resident individual taxpayers with income up to Rs 7 lakhs on account of rebate under Section 87A of the Act.

ITR Filing FY 2023-24 new versus old tax regime: The Indian government introduced the new tax regime in the Union Budget 2020 as a simplified alternative to the existing tax structure for individual and Hindu Undivided Family (HUF) taxpayers. The new tax regime offers lower tax rates compared to the old regime albeit with a condition that taxpayers must forgo certain exemptions, deductions and claim of losses.This system presents a trade-off between lower tax rates and the ability to claim various exemptions/ deductions/ losses.As the deadline for filing tax returns for FY 2023-24 approaches, it is essential to understand the nuances of the new tax regime to make an informed decision. This article aims to shed light on some of the key elements of the new tax regime.Also Read | Income Tax Return Filing FY 2023-24: Top myths busted - what you should keep in mind when filing ITR Individuals having no business income have an option to change the tax regime to the old tax regime at the time of filing tax return on a year-on-year basis. However, individuals with business incomes can choose to change to the old tax regime and switch back to the default new tax regime only once in their lifetime. In such a case, a new form 10-IEA is required to be filed for opting out of the new tax regime. Further, to re-enter in default new tax regime, said form is also required to be filed. Form 10-IEA must be filed before the due date of filing the ITR for the relevant assessment year. If you do not file Form 10-IEA, you will automatically be considered under the default new tax regime.Mr. A has gross salary income of Rs 15 lakhs and has made tax deductible investments u/s 80C of Rs 1.5 lakhs. Which tax regime will be more beneficial?Hence, despite the higher taxable income, the lower tax rate in the new tax regime results in a lower tax liability as the deductions under the old regime are low.Mr. B has gross salary income of Rs 15 lakhs and has made tax deductible investments u/s 80C (other than NPS) of Rs 1.5 lakhs along with HRA exemption Rs 2,00,000 and medical insurance premium for self of Rs 25,000. Which tax regime will be more beneficial?As you can observe here, since Mr. B has more qualifying deductions under the old regime, despite the lower tax rates in the new tax regime, the tax liability as per the old regime is still lower.To conclude, the choice between the old and new tax regime depends on the individual taxpayer's income structure as well as overall financial planning and goals.

Popularizing the New and Simplified Personal Tax Regime

Increasing the standard deduction

Direct payment of income tax refund to overseas bank accounts

(The author is Partner Mainstay Tax Advisors LLP. Views expressed are personal)

Budget 2024 income tax expectations : Increase in the limits of various exemptions and deductions is one of the prime expectations of the individual taxpayers from any Union Budget. But with the current government’s focus on a simplified tax regime with minimal exemptions and deductions, do the taxpayers need to adjust their old-time favorite expectation ? Should the taxpayer expect tax reliefs in the New Tax Regime instead ? Either way, the individual taxpayers have high hopes from this Budget, especially in the absence of any tax proposals announced in the interim budget in Feb 2024.In this article, I list some of the expectations of individual taxpayers from the Union Budget 2024 to be presented on 23 July 2024.A New Personal Tax Regime was introduced in Budget 2020 which was simple, in the sense that it allowed for very limited exemptions and deductions. To increase the takers for this regime and make it more tax beneficial for them, the Government then brought several changes in the new regime. Such as allowing standard deduction , higher basic exemption limit of Rs 3 lakh (as against Rs 2.5 lakh in the old regime), wider tax slabs, reduced surcharge from 37% to 25% on incomes above Rs 5 crore, nil tax liability for individuals with incomes up to Rs 7 lakh etc.The government further made it a default tax regime w.e.f. FY 2023-24, continuing to move to its vision of a simplified tax system in India.Marching towards the same goal, I expect that the government may propose further changes in the regime, to attract even those taxpayers who are still opting for the old tax regime. This may involve either further relaxing the slabs by widening them or restructuring them. Currently, 30% tax rate is applicable on incomes above Rs 15 lakh. The government may increase the same to Rs 20 lakh.Also Read | Budget 2024: Government may offer guarantee under NPS to allay fears Standard deduction is a vanilla / blanket tax deduction allowed to the salaried taxpayers, irrespective of the expenses or investments done by them.To provide further tax relief to the salaried taxpayers while keeping the tax system simple, I expect that the government may increase the standard deduction from Rs 50,000 to Rs 75,000 under the new tax regime.The income tax return form provides for mentioning the foreign bank account for direct credit of income tax refund, where the Non-Resident taxpayer does not have an Indian bank account. However, practically, such a facility is not yet active and the refunds cannot be credited to the foreign bank account for the NR taxpayer.Also Read | Income Tax expectations Budget 2024: Tax exempt limit for savings account interest to be raised to Rs 25,000? With a focus to improve taxpayer services and increasing use of technology and digital platforms in the tax system, I hope that the government activates the facility of direct credit of tax refund to foreign bank accounts.With India on its track to “Viksit Bharat” by 2047, and with a high growth target, the Government may put more disposable income in the hands of taxpayers, so as to further fuel consumption and growth of the economy. Therefore, one may expect some tax reliefs in the Union Budget 2024, however, they may continue to be along the same theme followed in earlier budgets – simplifying and rationalizing the India tax system!","Budget 2024 income tax expectations: Increase in the limits of various exemptions and deductions is one of the prime expectations of the individual taxpayers from any Union Budget.

Budget 2024 expectations : India has shown remarkable progress in the field of health and nutrition. Presently, over 50 crore Indians benefit from the Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB-PMJAY), ensuring their access to healthcare. The country has established 1.73 lakh Ayushman Aarogya Mandirs (AAMs) to offer comprehensive primary healthcare services.Over the past decade, the number of medical education seats for both under- and post-graduate programmes has more than doubled. Moreover, the out-of-pocket health expenditure has decreased from 63% in 2014 to 39% in 2024.Nevertheless, India still has a considerable distance to cover in comparison to global standards as it aims for Viksit Bharat @ 2047. The current life expectancy in India stands at 71 years, whereas it is 77 in China, 84 in Japan, and 75 in Brazil. India's Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) is 28 per 1000 live births, contrasting with 5 in China and less than 2 in Japan. South Africa's out-of-pocket health expenditure accounts for only about 8% of the total, in contrast to India's 39%.Presently, there are 10 doctors and 17 nurses and midwives per 10,000 individuals in India. In comparison, middle-income countries like China and Brazil have 17 doctors and 40 nurses and midwives per 10,000 persons, while high-income countries like the US and Australia have 39 doctors and 120 nurses and midwives per 10,000 individuals.Also Read | Budget 2024: Top 3 steps Modi government should consider for employment generation Countries such as Singapore, Taiwan, and South Korea have demonstrated the potential of harnessing the demographic dividend to achieve remarkable economic growth through the implementation of progressive policies and initiatives aimed at empowering the youth in making informed health choices. The allocation of adequate funds for the health sector in the Union Budget 2024-25 is of utmost importance. According to theNational Health Policy (NHP) 2017, India's healthcare expenditure should reach 2.5% of GDP by 2024-25.Notably, public healthcare spending in India encompasses health, family welfare, AYUSH, medical research, and water supply and sanitation. While some states have exceeded the 8% target outlined in the NHP 2017, others fall short, highlighting disparities in healthcare expenditure across states. Therefore, the central government plays a crucial role in augmenting state health expenditure to promote greater equity nationwide. Increased funding for nutrition, clean drinking water, and sanitation is also critical. The Budget 2024-25 should prioritize efforts to eradicate childhood undernutrition and anaemia among women and children.It is vital to increase investment in the health of children and adolescents, with a particular focus on early childhood development, care, and education for children aged 0–6 years. The first 1000 days of life, from a woman’s pregnancy to her child’s second birthday, present a unique opportunity to establish the foundation for lifelong health and development. Adequate nutrition and care during this period not only impact a child’s survival but also her ability to thrive, learn, and break the cycle of poverty. Strengthening the existing 14 lakh Anganwadi Centers and providing adequate training to staff in child development and learning, could have a significant impact.Also Read | Budget 2024: 7 structural reforms FM Nirmala Sitharaman should target for sustainable growth One crucial aspect to consider is the health of students in schools. The school-age phase is a key time for the body to start storing nutrients, which aids in rapid growth. Focusing on school children is essential for India to harness the potential of its young population, who will play a vital role in the future workforce and contribute to improving the nation's socio-economic status.Introducing a nationwide school health initiative can ensure the overall well-being of 255 million school children and teenagers aged 6-18, with a focus on physical and mental health, nutrition, wellness, and promoting a healthy lifestyle. Creating a school environment that encourages health and nutrition through activities such as yoga, physical education, mental health support, counselling, and regular health check-ups should be a top priority.The healthcare system's foundation is rooted in primary healthcare, which is essential for achieving the desired health outcomes by 2047. The future well-being of citizens depends heavily on the efficient delivery of services through our AAMs. Therefore, the transformation of all AAMs must be completed by 2027. Since 2018, the primary healthcare platform has been established with 173,000 AAMs, along with the deployment of community health officers, infrastructure upgrades, telemedicine services, and provision of free drugs and diagnostics.However, challenges related to full operationalization, coverage, quality, and continuity persist across states. The implementation of half of the package focusing on mental health, acute care, geriatric care, oral, visual, and ENT treatments, and emergency services needs to be improved. The other half of the package, which has been implemented, faces challenges with the inconsistent availability of medications and diagnostics at some AAMs. Although screenings for hypertension and diabetes have commenced, the emphasis also needs to be on treatment, follow-ups, and other services. Furthermore, cancer screening rates need to be improved, as does the training of personnel in critical areas.Research indicates that improved health outcomes contribute to enhanced economic productivity. It is essential that Budget 2024-25 is a transformational step towards securing additional funding for healthcare, alongside enhancing the quality of health services with the existing resources.","Budget 2024 expectations : India has shown remarkable progress in the field of health and nutrition.

Budget 2024 expectations : All eyes are on Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, who will present the Union Budget 2024 , on July 23. The logistics sector is especially hopeful, given the Rs 11 lakh crore boost allocated by the Interim Budget in February, by way of three major economic railway corridor programmes, including energy, mineral and cement corridors, port connectivity corridors, and high-traffic density corridors, under the PM Gati Shakti scheme .Looking ahead, we perceive the upcoming budget presenting a unique opportunity to balance the nation’s economic growth priorities with fiscal consolidation.To sustain the growth momentum of the logistics sector, prioritising capital expenditure in key infrastructure projects, alongside financial incentives such as PLI, tax benefits and subsidies are crucial as these will help drive innovation in logistics. Further, establishing a ‘One India’ logistics ecosystem and integrating initiatives such as the National Logistics Policy and Sagarmala Project are crucial in terms of enhancing India’s ranking on the global Logistics Performance Index. To reinforce India’s potential as a manufacturing powerhouse, the budget must focus on domestic manufacturing, and on preparing the logistics sector for service integration, growth in fulfilment logistics and multi-modal transportation adoption. The government should also consider automation investments, especially in technologically advanced warehouses, which can position India as a logistics innovation leader.We anticipate a stronger push for the EV industry, in the form of tax incentives, charging infrastructure subsidies and financial support for R&D. Establishing a holistic regulatory framework for last-mile delivery and formal recognition of the gig workforce under labour laws are essential to ensure fair employment practices in today’s digital economy.The logistics industry is a crucial driver of economic efficiency, and we are hopeful for the budget to include transformative measures that will drive innovation and inclusivity in the sector. We urge the government to address the logistics sector’s unique needs by enhancing the strategic allocations towardinfrastructure development , tax reforms and other governance policies. Besides this, a renewed focus on setting up digitally advanced processes with the use of cutting-edge technologies including artificial intelligence, machine learning, IoT, and big data will streamline efficiency.We hope the government will consider the inclusion of diesel under the GST ambit as this is a critical move in enabling India to reduce its logistics costs and become more competitive in the international market. It will also help key logistics players to regulate costs by cutting down on tax outflows.As we await the release of the Interim Budget, the logistics sector is primed for transformative measures that will fuel our nation’s journey to a USD 5 trillion economy. The forthcoming budget presents a significant opportunity to reinforce our commitment to enhancing the ease of doing business with India. India’s logistics costs, as highlighted by DPIIT, are encouraging; but our gaze must look beyond mere cost considerations. A strategic allocation of resources towards infrastructure, competence and traceability is essential for sustained progress.A sustained focus on and adopting a long-term perspective towards building key physical and digital infrastructure, incentivising multimodal logistics for carbon reduction, and robust skilling initiatives for the 22 million individuals employed in the sector should be the key priorities for the upcoming budget. To boost EXIM trade and improve competitiveness, we must maintain the momentum in investments and digitalisation. This approach will empower India to progress rapidly towards a more resilient and sustainable transport and logistics ecosystem.","All eyes are on Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, who will present the Union Budget 2024, on July 23.

In contrast, NPS is a defined contribution scheme where a govt employee provides 10% of the basic salary as his/her contribution and the Centre provides 14%.While the Somanathan committee has looked at the global experience, as well as the results of the tweak undertaken by the Andhra Pradesh govt, it has also carried out extensive calculations to gauge the impact of providing an assured return. Although it is possible for the Centre to offer 40-45% guarantee, politically, it does not address the concern of employees who work for 25-30 years.

The Future of Energy Storage

Emerging Market Opportunities

The writer is CMD, Indian Energy Exchange.

Budget 2024 expectations : As Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman prepares to present the Union Budget this month, the Modi 3.0 government aims to bolster the Indian economy with a keen focus on infrastructure. A critical component of this infrastructure is the power sector, where power exchanges can play a transformative role in enhancing efficiency, transparency, and competitive price discovery.Power exchanges are pivotal in India's power sector, offering over 25 contracts across various market segments and trading more than 120 billion units (BUs) annually. Despite this, power exchanges account for only about 7% of the country's total power generation, a stark contrast to European countries where over 50% of generation is traded through exchanges. This discrepancy underscores the significant growth potential for India's power exchanges.Recognizing the importance of a robust power market, the government’s Draft National Electricity Policy aims to increase the share of spot markets to 25% by 2030. This policy aligns with India's commitment to reducing the emission intensity of its GDP by 45% from 2005 levels and achieving net-zero emissions by 2070. To support these goals, the government plans to have 50% of installed generation capacity from non-fossil sources by 2030, necessitating around 500 GW ofrenewable energy (RE) capacity.The integration of renewable energy (RE) into India's grid can be significantly accelerated through power exchanges. Renewable sources often exhibit variability and intermittent generation, posing challenges for forecasting. Power exchanges offer solutions such as the Day Ahead Market (DAM) and Real Time Market (RTM), which provide flexible trading options to manage these fluctuations effectively.International examples illustrate how power exchanges can reduce renewable integration costs and offer efficient price signals. A Deloitte study highlights that market-based RE projects can achieve higher internal rates of return (IRR) compared to Power Purchase Agreement (PPA)-based projects. This approach addresses issues like signing delays, timely payments, and avoiding disputes.The Ministry of Power’s report on the ""Development of Electricity Market in India"" also advocates for a larger role for power exchanges, citing the inefficiencies of long-term PPAs. The report suggests models such as Contracts for Difference (CfD) and Virtual PPAs, which have been successful in countries like the UK and Germany.The future of renewable energy integration hinges on grid-level energy storage. Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) are poised to drive sector growth, offering cost-effective 24/7 renewable power. Recent tenders have shown significant tariff reductions, making BESS a promising solution for rapid decarbonization.The establishment of a Capacity Market is a key anticipated change, aimed at bridging power generation with national demand and determining optimal energy mixes. Additionally, the government's push for Green Hydrogen and Rooftop Solar projects is setting the stage for Peer-to-Peer (P2P) trading, which will revolutionize power consumption in India.Power exchanges have consistently delivered lower prices compared to other procurement methods over the past 15 years. As India advances towards energy banking solutions, energy storage, and green hydrogen, new products on power exchanges will be crucial in meeting the country's future energy demands. The Union Budget 2024 presents a pivotal opportunity to harness the potential of power exchanges, driving India towards a sustainable and efficient energy future.",Power exchanges offer over 25 contracts across various market segments and trading more than 120 billion units (BUs) annually.

Budget 2024 expectations : As India strives to attain developed nation status, the healthcare sector stands as a crucial component, underpinning the nation's aims for inclusive growth, sustainable development, and a bright future for its citizens. Over the past decade, India has made notable progress in healthcare, with significant advancements in infrastructure, technology, and accessibility.While the government has undertaken numerous vital reforms for the healthcare sector, the industry stakeholders have high expectations from the new government on the healthcare needs of the nation, especially regarding public health spending , which is anticipated to increase to 2.5% of GDP by 2025, aligning with the National Health Policy 2017 . To enhance healthcare infrastructure, there's a need to realign financing schemes to meet sector needs, ensuring a minimum lending period of 10 years. This should cover medical colleges and their academic and hospital wings, including nursing and allied healthcare.Standardization in clinical practice through robust implementation of Standard Treatment Guidelines across all states is essential. For tackling NCDs like Cancer, a nodal agency should be set up for cancer care that will consolidate and simplify various programs and regulations currently under various departments and include innovative screening technologies (AI/non-AI) for early detection of diseases in the national program guidelines.We need to strengthen Ayushman Bharat - Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB-PMJAY) and expand the limit to 10 lakhs for all covered population and 15 lakh for specific diseases like organ transplant, oncology treatment etc. Additionally, a scientific costing study for various treatments under AB-PMJAY is necessary to determine sustainable reimbursement rates, encouraging private healthcare providers to participate and help expand the scheme to senior citizens (70 years & above), as announced by the government, and the underserved. Viable package rates are crucial so that existing secondary and tertiary care private hospitals join the scheme and newer hospitals can be built to meet the increased number of patients who would avail the scheme.Augmenting and strengthening the healthcare workforce is also critical for the Indian healthcare sector. An 'Empowered Group on National Healthcare Workforce' should be established, providing a multi-stakeholder platform to develop a comprehensive strategy for workforce development. A national-level registry for all types of healthcare workers that will serve as a tool to help Central and state governments’ plan for upskilling and interventions for equitable distribution of the workforce can be created. We also need to construct an epidemiologic ‘needs-based’ model for healthcare workforce planning that considers the health needs of the population, disease burden, population growth, healthcare delivery infrastructure, and other critical parameters. Such a model could use demographic population projections to estimate the number of nurses and physicians required to provide this core set of services in 2047.For ease of doing business, we need to reduce the compliance burden by establishing a Single Window Clearance System for the health services sector for investors and companies. Currently 55+ licenses are required, with multiple portals in different states asking for similar data requirements along with multiple application and payment processes. There are 179 Laws, Regulations, Rules and Guidelines applicable to healthcare organisations. Implementation of the Clinical Establishment Act should be uniform for all states.Further, it is important to allow hospitals and healthcare facilities to avail input tax credit (ITC), under the GST regime, so that the credit chain is enabled for the health services sector. Currently the healthcare facilities are unable to avail ITC leading to higher cost of services to patients.","The healthcare sector stands as a crucial component, underpinning the nation's aims for inclusive growth, sustainable development, and a bright future for its citizens.

A bench headed by Justice Sanjiv Khanna will pronounce the verdict.The apex court had reserved its decision on May 17.During the hearings, Additional Solicitor General SV Raju argued that there was evidence of money being sent to the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) through hawala channels.According to Raju, the ED found chats between Kejriwal and hawala operators concerning the proceeds of crime.Senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, representing Kejriwal, challenged the ED's material, stating it was not available during Kejriwal's arrest.On May 10, the Supreme Court granted Kejriwal interim bail until June 1 in the money laundering case . However, the court ordered that he should not visit the Office of the chief minister or the Delhi Secretariat. The bench directed Kejriwal to surrender on June 2, and he complied with this order.Kejriwal’s plea in the apex court is an appeal against the Delhi high court's judgment, which dismissed his plea against his arrest and subsequent remand by the ED in the excise policy case.

"Food safety scandal: Fuel tanker trucks used to transport cooking oil in China, suggests report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/food-safety-scandal-fuel-tanker-trucks-used-to-transport-cooking-oil-in-china-suggests-report/articleshow/111628414.cms,"Massive public outcry

China's food safety commission is set to investigate the reported use of fuel tanker trucks for transporting cooking oil, the state media reported. The revelation has sparked harsh criticism and raised fears of food contamination in a nation that numerous food and drug safety scandals have shaken in recent decades.According to CNN, the scandal involves China's largest grain storage and transport company, Sinograin, and private conglomerate, Hopefull Grain and Oil Group.Both companies have said that investigations are underway.The Beijing News, a local daily, reported last week that Sinograin's fuel tankers were discovered transporting food products such as cooking oil, soybean oil, and syrup without properly cleaning the tankers between shipments. In response to the allegations, the food safety commission will convene a special meeting with the National Development and Reform Commission, the State Administration of Grain and Reserves, and other ministries to discuss and investigate the matter, as reported by state broadcaster CCTV.CCTV said, ""Illegal enterprises and relevant responsible persons will be severely punished under the law and will not be tolerated.""Chinese food products have faced domestic and international scrutiny following a series of scandals, particularly the deadly milk scandal in 2008, where infant formula was found to contain the industrial chemical melamine. To improve food safety controls and reassure importers, Beijing has taken steps to address these issues, while some Chinese consumers have turned to foreign brands perceived as more trustworthy.The Beijing News referred to the cooking oil issue as an ""open secret"" in the transport industry, and CCTV described it as ""tantamount to poisoning.""On China's heavily censored social media platforms, many citizens called for product recalls and increased industry oversight. Some also seemed to connect the situation to broader issues in the country, where an economic downturn is fueling social frustration, and there are deep-rooted concerns about the lack of accountability for powerful and government-linked entities.Despite improvements in living standards over recent decades, food safety remains an ongoing concern in China. Local media has reported dozens of high-profile scandals, prompting stricter government regulation.","China's food safety commission is set to investigate the reported use of fuel tanker trucks for transporting cooking oil.

"US inflation broadly cools, likely sealing deal for fed rate cut",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-inflation-broadly-cools-likely-sealing-deal-for-fed-rate-cut/articleshow/111667320.cms,"US inflation cooled broadly in June to the slowest pace since 2021 on the back of a long-awaited slowdown in housing costs , sending the strongest signal yet that the Federal Reserve can cut interest rates soon.The so-called core consumer price index — which excludes food and energy costs — climbed 0.1% from May, the smallest advance in three years, Bureau of Labor Statistics figures showed Thursday.The overall measure fell for the first time since the onset of the pandemic, dragged down by cheaper gasoline.Similar to the May CPI report — which Fed Chair Jerome Powell described this week as “really good” following an unexpected flare-up in the first quarter — the June reading will go a long way toward giving Powell and his colleagues the confidence they need to cut rates, likely starting in September. Policymakers will have a chance to signal such a move may be coming when they meet later in July, especially since unemployment has now risen for three straight months.Powell, in testimony before lawmakers this week, avoided signaling the timing of likely rate cuts and insisted policy moves would be guided by incoming data. The Fed chief is set to speak again Monday afternoon in a moderated discussion hosted by the Economic Club of Washington, DC.“We are sufficiently confident — even if the Fed is not yet ready to admit they are — that inflation is on the way back to the 2% target,” Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM US LLP, said in a note. “The road is now open to a rate cut by the Federal Reserve in September.”After the CPI report, Treasuries rallied and traders all but fully priced in September and December rate cuts. They also marked up the odds of a reduction in November to better than even — a move that would come right after the presidential election. Before Thursday, traders and policymakers were divided as to whether there would be just one or two cuts this year.The report also offered encouraging news for President Joe Biden as he prepares for a high-stakes press conference later Thursday amid calls from fellow Democrats for him to step aside as the party’s nominee. The embattled president cheered the data in a statement, saying it shows “significant progress” in the fight against inflation.Metric Actual EstimateCPI MoM -0.1% +0.1%Core CPI MoM +0.1% +0.2%CPI YoY +3.0% +3.1%Core CPI YoY +3.3% +3.4%Shelter prices, which is the largest category within services, climbed 0.2%, the smallest gain since August 2021. Owners’ equivalent rent — a subset of shelter, which is the biggest individual component of the CPI — climbed 0.3%, also the tamest in three years.“Probably the most significant aspect of the June report is the downshift in housing inflation,” said Julia Coronado, the founder of MacroPolicy Perspectives LLC and former Fed economist. “It looks broad-based and durable, and numerous Fed officials have indicated a downshift would boost their confidence that inflation is indeed returning to 2% in a sustainable way.”In addition to slower rent increases, the costs of other services like airfares, hotel stays and inpatient hospital care all declined from a month earlier. New and used vehicle prices led broader decreases in the core goods basket.The BLS noted that the new vehicles index was estimated with fewer prices than in previous months due to a cyberattack that hit thousands of dealerships in June, but software systems have since been restored. “BLS has no further information on when typical data flows will resume and is monitoring the situation closely,” according to the report.Separate figures Thursday showed recurring applications for jobless benefits held near the highest level since late 2021. At the same time, first-time filings fell by 17,000 last week — matching the largest drop in a year — providing some optimism that the job market is holding up.This is a modal window.The media could not be loaded, either because the server or network failed or because the format is not supported.Excluding housing and energy, services prices fell for a second month, according to Bloomberg calculations. While central bankers have stressed the importance of looking at such a metric when assessing the nation’s inflation trajectory, they compute it based on a separate index.That measure, known as the personal consumption expenditures price index, doesn’t put as much weight on shelter as the CPI does. That helps explain why the PCE gauge has been trending closer to the Fed’s 2% target.The PCE measure, released later this month, draws from the CPI as well as certain categories within the producer price index, which is due Friday.The latest results from Delta Air Lines Inc. suggest more scope for services inflation to cool. The carrier’s revenue projections came in weaker than forecast as competition in the domestic market drives ticket prices lower.Meanwhile, a sustained decline in the price of goods over most of the past year has largely been providing some relief to consumers. So-called core goods prices, which exclude food and energy commodities, fell in June for a fourth month.Prices of new vehicles declined for a sixth month, and several apparel categories dropped as well. The cost of household furnishings has fallen nearly every month for the past year.There are also signs that consumers are growing increasingly sensitive to higher prices. Earlier on Thursday, PepsiCo Inc. reported weaker-than-expected revenue growth as budget-focused shoppers weighed on the volume of goods sold. The salty snacks category has been particularly lackluster.A separate report Thursday, combining the inflation data with figures on wages published last week, showed real earnings growth has been positive for the past year.","US inflation cooled broadly in June to the slowest pace since 2021. The slowdown in housing costs is the strongest signal yet that the Federal Reserve can cut interest rates soon.

How Xi Jinping can surprise world with big-bang moves,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/how-xi-jinping-can-surprise-world-with-big-bang-moves/articleshow/111651557.cms,"China has the firepower to end its housing crisis at a high-stakes policy meeting, including with a “big-bang solution” that involves pumping money like the Federal Reserve. But it’s unlikely to pull the trigger.That’s according to Bloomberg Economics, which said if the People’s Bank of China printed money on a scale similar to the Fed during the global financial crisis, it could finance the purchase of about 70% of the unsold property stock.“That’s a big-bang solution that would result in significant collateral damage — we don’t think Beijing would go that far,” economists David Qu and Chang Shu said. “Still, it shows the potential for policy solutions.”The Third Plenum, set for July 15-18, is one of the most important political meetings of the Chinese Communist Party . It’s expected to unveil a series of economic reforms and policies aimed at addressing long-standing issues that have impeded growth and recovery. Property polices are a key area of focus, as the real estate downturn remains the biggest threat to the economy.The PBOC in May announced a $41 billion program to help state-owned firms buy unsold housing stock. “That’s a promising approach, but so far insufficient to address the scale of the problem,” the Bloomberg economists wrote in a note. This would pay for less than 1% of unsold housing inventory, they said.Bloomberg Economics looked at three scenarios for how much money the PBOC could print to help local governments buy up unsold houses.If the PBOC expanded its balance sheet by about 24 trillion yuan ($3.3 trillion yuan) — similar to what the Fed did from 2008 to 2014 — it would pay for around 70% of the unsold housing stock in China.An expansion of 13 trillion yuan — similar to the European Central Bank from 2009 to 2012 after the European debt crisis — would finance the purchase of about 40% of the inventory.The flip side is that quantitative easing of this scale would come at the cost of rapidly rising debt, pressure on the yuan to fall, faster inflation and much heavier debt loads for state-owned firms and local governments, Bloomberg Economics said.The most likely option would resemble China’s “shanty-town redevelopment” program from 2015 to 2018, which tore down older homes nationwide and replaced them with new apartments. A repeat of this program, with the central bank providing 3.6 trillion yuan to banks, would finance the purchase of 10% of the stock of unsold homes.It could also provide low-cost homes for 1.6% of China’s population, Bloomberg Economics said. This would raise growth by 0.2 percentage points this year and a full percentage point in both 2025 and 2026, they estimate, as banks make more loans and confidence would increase due to the support.“Of course, quantitative easing is not a free lunch,” the economists wrote. “Adding to yuan depreciation pressure, renewing moral hazard and zeroing out future policy space are among the costs.”","China has the firepower to end its housing crisis, including with a “big-bang solution” that involves pumping money like the Federal Reserve.

A rally in the world’s largest technology companies sent stocks to all-time highs, with Jerome Powell ’s remarks to Congress not doing much to dissuade traders from betting on Federal Reserve rate cuts this year.For the first time in its history, the S&P 500 topped 5,600. A renewed bid for megacaps drove the US equity benchmark to its longest rally since November, with Nvidia Corp.up over 2.5% and Apple Inc. climbing on news it aims to ship 10% more new iPhones after a bumpy 2023. Treasuries remained fairly stable after a strong $39 billion sale of 10-year bonds. Swaps are pricing in two Fed cuts in 2024 — and higher chances the first comes in September.As Wall Street geared up for the consumer-price index, Powell said the Fed doesn’t need inflation below 2% before cutting rates, while adding officials still have more work to do. He noted the labor market has cooled “pretty significantly.” Powell cited a “good ways to go” on the balance-sheet runoff, and said commercial real estate doesn’t threaten financial stability.“The key takeaway from his testimony is the Fed’s assessment of the balance of risks is shifting in ways that – if supported and sustained by incoming data – will deliver a rate cut in September,” said Krishna Guha at Evercore.The S&P 500 climbed 1% — up for a seventh straight day — to notch its 37th record this year.

That would mark the smallest back-to-back gains since August — a pace more palatable for Fed officials.“June’s CPI report looks to be another ‘very good’ report that should boost the FOMC’s confidence about the inflation trajectory,” said Anna Wong at Bloomberg Economics. “That should set the stage for the Fed to start cutting rates in September.”A survey conducted by 22V Research shows 55% of investors expect the market reaction Thursday’s CPI to be “risk-on,” 16% said “risk-off” and 29% “mixed/negligible.”“There is optimism about inflation generally,” said Dennis DeBusschere at 22V, adding that the survey also showed investors think “CPI is on a Fed-friendly glide path.”Meantime, some trading desks say investors should gear up for a potential break in the eerie calm that’s recently descended on the market.The options market is betting the S&P 500 Index will move 0.8% in either direction after Thursday’s report on consumer prices, based on the price of that day’s at-the-money straddles, according to Stuart Kaiser, Citigroup’s head of US equity trading strategy.If it happens, that would be the biggest move for the index since June 12, the day of the last CPI print and interest-rate decision.Market volatility may pick up in the days and weeks ahead, amid US political uncertainty, comments from the Fed chair, and the start of the second-quarter earnings season, according to Mark Haefele at UBS Global Wealth Management.Source: Citi Global MarketsFor the first time since 2022, S&P 500 earnings may not be laser-focused on just technology, with the quarter’s success hanging on everything aside from the megacap tech heavyweights that have driven stocks to all-time highs, according to Bloomberg Intelligence strategists led by Gina Martin Adams.“While forecasts for the ‘Magnificent Seven’ remain robust, their earnings are expected to slow in the second quarter — just as the rest of the S&P 500 may finally post their first year-on-year growth in at least five quarters,” they noted.The Magnificent Seven may have already peaked, while the remaining S&P 500 stocks may post their first earnings expansion in at least six quarters, the strategists concluded.","S&P 500 Sees Longest Winning Streak Since November.

It is widely believed that Jeff Bezos decided to buy The Washington Post at this retreat, and Comcast's acquisition of NBC Universal was also reportedly conceived here. Warren Buffett famously referred to Sun Valley dealmaking as “acquisitions by walking around.”The Idaho Mountain Express and Variety have reported a parade of private jets arriving on Tuesday, July 9, carrying dozens of power brokers including:Other prominent names from the tech and business sector expected to attend are Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Andy Jassy, Peter Thiel, Daniel Ek, Neal Mohan, Michael J Cavanagh, Dara Khosrowshahi, Brian Chesky, Mike Fries, Barry Diller, Alex Karp, Ynon Kreiz, and Marc Benioff.From the entertainment and fashion world, notable attendees include Shari Redstone, Jason Blum, Brian Grazer, Bobby Kotick, Charles Rivkin, Bryan Lourd, François-Henri Pinault, Sara Blakely, Michael Rapino, Anthony Wood, and Netflix co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters.Political figures expected to attend include Michael Bloomberg, Chuck Schumer, Amos Yadlin, Kyrsten Sinema, Wes Moore, Brad Little, Mark Gordon, Gretchen Whitmer, and Josh Shapiro.Media representatives attending are Gayle King, David Begnaud, Anderson Cooper, Erin Burnett, Elle Duncan, Becky Quick, Tom Friedman, Andrew Ross Sorkin, and Evan Osnos.The retreat's agenda is kept secret, and attendees engage in closed-door lectures on topics ranging from national security to healthcare. Despite the secrecy, there is anticipation of discussions around artificial intelligence, Bob Iger’s succession plan, and the Paramount-Skydance merger.One notable absence this year is Warren Buffett, who at nearly 94, is possibly handing over the reins to his successor, Greg Abel. Elon Musk is also absent, following last year's public fallout with other CEOs.As the elite gather to discuss the future, questions about President Joe Biden’s ability to campaign loom large, with potential 2024 ballot replacements being a hot topic. Governors Gretchen Whitmer, Josh Shapiro, and Wes Moore are seen as potential contenders.","This week marks the beginning of the “annual fly-in event” at Friedman Memorial Airport in Hailey, Idaho.

Otherwise, they will face tariffs of 25 percent.Under Biden's latest proclamation, aluminum imports from Mexico that contain primary aluminum smelt or were cast in China, Belarus, Iran or Russia will also face a 10 percent tariff.Mexico will require importers to provide information about the products' countries of origin.""These actions fix a major loophole that the previous administration failed to address, and that countries like China use to avoid US tariffs by shipping their products through Mexico,"" Brainard said.She charged that ""Chinese steel and aluminum entering the US market through Mexico evades tariffs, undermines our investments and harms American workers in states like Pennsylvania and Ohio.""As Biden's reelection bid enters a critical stage, the president has been working to win over voters in swing states including Pennsylvania.A senior US official conceded that the latest measures are ""forward-looking.""Nearly 90 percent of some 3.8 million tons of steel imports from Mexico is already melted and poured in either the United States, Canada or Mexico, an official said on condition of anonymity.The remaining comes from a number of countries including China, the official added without giving further details.Similarly, of the 105,000 metric tons of aluminum from Mexico, 94 percent was smelted or cast in the same three North American countries.But officials maintained that China was producing well above domestic demand, warning that ""a lot of the excess capacity is bound to be exported abroad.""""These joint actions with Mexico will help to ensure the long-term viability of our steel and aluminum industries,"" said US Trade Representative Katherine Tai.In May, the United States announced steep tariff hikes on Chinese imports like electric vehicles and semiconductors, as Biden warned that Washington would not let China flood the US market.But tariffs on sectors like EVs were considered pre-emptive, since few such cars are imported.","U.S. moves to prevent China-origin goods from avoiding tariffs.

Reads the last line (in screaming all capital letters) of a notice board at Boeing 's Renton final assembly line (FLA) in Seattle where the ill-famed MAX version of the once best-selling B737s are rolled out. It reminds technicians at work here that ""737 conformance rate for multiple (assembly) processes has dropped below confidence level"" and that the goal is to ""ensure a conforming product (for) our customers.""With Boeing agreeing to plead guilty to a criminal fraud conspiracy in the US, the old slogan ""if it's not Boeing, I am not going,"" is a distant memory for now.Amid enhanced oversight by America's Federal Aviation Administration, Boeing is trying hard to win the trust back. It recently opened the doors of its single (737) and twin (777) aisle FLAs in Seattle to a section of the world's media. The senior management admitted of lapses in recent years, while assuring corrective steps are being taken.Clearly, there's a lot of work to be done to regain the confidence. Multiple aerospace industry insiders in the US who worked for Boeing said the focus in last few years had shifted from engineering excellence to financial performance.The final straw proved to be the recent MAX scare - Jan 5, 2024, door plug blowout on an Alaska Air B737-9 MAX in the US. Elizabeth Lund, Boeing's senior VP (quality) says the company's first reaction ""was to take immediate action to ensure that no airplane ever leaves our factory that could cause an accident. I will tell you very transparently.""Jason Clark, VP & GM of the B777 programme and Everett site leader, said ""employee involvement (EI) - where workers discuss production issues regularly - has been brought back. ""It was done away with as there was a lot of overlap. By doing so, we lost the voice of the mechanic. Now we have again created groups for mechanics to discuss and fix problems,"" Clark said.The increased focus on safety and checks has meant Boeing is churning out lot less planes.(The reporter was in Seattle at the invitation of Boeing)","Boeing has admitted lapses in recent years, while assuring corrective steps are being taken.

Jerome Powell: More good inflation data would boost Fed confidence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/jerome-powell-more-good-inflation-data-would-boost-fed-confidence/articleshow/111612325.cms,"Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said “more good data” would strengthen confidence that inflation is moving down toward the US central bank’s 2% target, and recent readings point to “modest further progress” on prices.In testimony prepared for a Senate hearing Tuesday, Powell warned that lowering interest rates too little or too late could put the economy and the labor market at risk.“Elevated inflation is not the only risk we face,” he told lawmakers on the first of two days of congressional testimony. “Reducing policy restraint too late or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment.”The Fed chair also said cutting rates too soon or too much could stall or reverse inflation progress.“More good data would strengthen our confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2%,” Powell told the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs in prepared remarks. He testifies Wednesday before the House Financial Services Committee.US central bankers are aiming to bring inflation back to the 2% goal following a post-pandemic surge in prices. While the labor market has held up under pressure from higher interest rates, an uptick in the unemployment rate has added political pressure on Fed officials to start reducing borrowing costs.Powell’s remarks suggest the Federal Open Market Committee is unlikely to reduce rates when it meets at the end of this month.Treasury yields oscillated but were higher on the day and the S&P 500 index remained higher after Powell’s testimony was released.Traders are pricing in a just over 70% probability that the Fed first cuts rates in September. They see two quarter-point rate reductions in 2024.Fed officials have welcomed recent data indicating inflation is decelerating again following a jump in prices at the start of the year, though several other policymakers have also said they need more confidence that the trend will continue before reducing borrowing costs.The Fed’s preferred inflation measure rose 2.6% in the 12 months through May, down from 7.1% in June 2022. While unemployment remains low at 4.1%, it has ticked up in each of the last three months.A number of economists are warning that there’s a slowdown afoot in the job market that could worsen. The number of people who have been looking for a job for 15 weeks or more rose in June to the highest level since early 2022, when that measure was rapidly declining.Powell called the labor market “strong, but not overheated,” adding that the central bank’s restrictive stance is working to bring supply and demand into better balance.“Another increase in the jobless rate in the July report could challenge our base case of one rate cut this year in December, raising the possibility of two cuts starting in September,” said Yelena Shulyatyeva, senior economist at BNP Paribas.The Fed has held its policy rate at what it describes as a restrictive level of 5.25% to 5.5% for a year. Futures traders have almost fully priced in a cut for the Sept 17-18 policy meeting, less than two months before the US election.","Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell testifies before a Senate committee.

Boeing to plead guilty in probe of 737 MAX crashes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/boeing-to-plead-guilty-in-probe-of-737-max-crashes/articleshow/111587391.cms,"Boeing will plead guilty to criminal conspiracy in connection with two fatal crashes of its 737 Max jetliner , an agreement that disgraces the storied US planemaker as a felon but avoids a bruising courtroom confrontation as it tries to rebound from multiple crises.Under the agreement with US prosecutors, Boeing faces a criminal fine of as much as $487 million - the maximum allowed by law - though the actual amount will be determined by a judge, according to the Justice Department.The DOJ asked the judge to credit Boeing for the prior fine it paid, which would bring the new penalty down to $244 million, if approved.The company will install a corporate monitor and be required to spend at least $455 million to bolster its compliance and safety programs over the next three years as part of the deal, which requires court approval. It would also be subject to a period of court-supervised probation.The Justice Department determined in May that Boeing breached a 2021 deferred-prosecution agreement tied to the crashes that was struck in the waning days of the Trump Administration. That followed the blowout of a fuselage panel on a 737 Max 9 on Jan 5, just days before the deal was set to expire.The guilty plea marks a low point in the company's century-long history after years of turmoil sparked by two crashes of its 737 Max aircraft in 2018 and 2019 that killed 346 people. The agreement also has the potential to complicate Boeing's interaction with govt as a major defence contractor.
