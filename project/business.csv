In FY21, international travel spending had dipped to $3.2 billion due to restrictions on mobility.On the other hand, the share of remittance going towards education abroad has steadily declined. In FY21, remittance for education was 30% largely because travel was subdued during the pandemic. The share fell to 26% after travel restrictions were lifted in FY22. Spending on education dipped in FY23 in absolute terms to $3.4 billion from $5.2 billion in the year before, resulting in the share of overall spend falling to 12%. In FY24, spending on studies abroad was flat at nearly $3.5 billion even as travel spending soared.As a result of lesser spending on fees, studies abroad is no longer the second-biggest category in forex spends.

Govt eyes $12 billion bonanza from RBI,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/govt-eyes-12-billion-bonanza-from-rbi/articleshow/110317738.cms,"India’s central bank is expected to pay up to one trillion rupees ($12 billion) as dividend to the federal government, economists said, a move that would boost New Delhi’s coffers and help meet its budget deficit target.The Reserve Bank of India ’s central bank of directors is expected to meet this week and is likely to approve a dividend ranging between 800 billion to one trillion rupees, according to economists’ estimates.That compares with a transfer of 874.2 billion rupees last year and the government’s own target of 1.02 trillion rupees, which includes dividends from state-controlled banks.If the RBI pays out a dividend worth one trillion rupees, it will be the highest in five years.The higher dividend payout is likely to help the federal government achieve its fiscal deficit target of 5.1% of gross domestic product in the current financial year. It would also likely shore up revenues for any new government that takes office after general elections conclude early next month, allowing it greater spending flexibility.A big surplus transfer “will help the government in meeting any shortfall in disinvestment receipts and create room for funding welfare programs after the elections,” said Teresa John, an economist with Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities, by phone. She forecasts the dividend payout to be around one trillion rupees.The RBI makes an annual payout to the government from the surplus income it earns on investments and valuation changes on its dollar holdings, and the fees it gets from printing currency. It is mandated to maintain a contingency risk buffer of 5.5% to 6.5% of its balance sheet.Among the key factors that could contribute to a large surplus transfer are higher interest income that the central bank would have earned on securities held abroad and in the domestic market. Those earnings are expected on the back of a tighter monetary policy regime in many advanced economies and back home.However, earnings on foreign exchange transactions could be lower as the central bank sold less dollars in the last fiscal year than the previous year, Gaura Sen Gupta, an economist with IDFC First Bank wrote in a note earlier this month. In the year to March 2024, RBI’s foreign exchange reserves went up by $67 billion.A large dividend, coupled with high cash surplus may allow the finance ministry to cut its bond sales, aiding lower borrowing costs, people familiar with the matter said, Bloomberg reported Tuesday. India plans to borrow a record 14.13 trillion rupees in the financial year ending March 2025, according to the February interim budget.An expected bonanza for New Delhi comes just a month before Indian bonds are added to the JPMorgan Chase and Co.’s emerging market index. That inclusion is likely to see inflows of up to $25 billion and could see the central bank’s balance sheet swell in the fiscal year to March 2025, making it essential for tweaks to be carried out to meet the minimum levels of capital. The RBI is widely expected to intervene and absorb the bulk of the inflows expected due to the bond inclusion.The ballooning of the balance sheet could lead to revisions in the RBI’s economic capital framework at some point later in the year, wrote Barclays Plc.’s economists Shreya Sodhani and Amruta Ghare in a note earlier this month. They estimate a dividend payout of over a trillion rupees, which could increase if the framework is revised.Any reduction in contingency risk buffer, and dilution of revaluation balances, “could have material fiscal implications, by increasing dividends paid to the government,” they said.",The Reserve Bank of India ’s central bank of directors is expected to meet this week. It is likely to approve a dividend ranging between 800 billion to one trillion rupees. That compares with a transfer of 874.2 billion rupees last year and the government’s own target.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110317813,imgsize-28660,width-400,resizemode-4/110317813.jpg"

The finance minister set the stage for a ""Viksit Bharat by 2047"", on the core principles of ‘Sabka Saath’, ‘Sabka Vikas’, ‘Sabka Vishwas’, with ‘Sabka Prayas’ being added as a new theme in the interim Budget.This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data i.e., farmer welfare and N for Nari utthan i.e., support for women entrepreneurs.These form the pillars of a comprehensive inclusive development. The Government's commitment to sustainable development under the strategy for Amrit Kaal includes achieving 'Net Zero' by 2070, rooftop solarization for one crore households and robust health initiatives.The Indian economy's resilience takes center stage amidst positive indicators of declining current account deficit as a percentage of GDP, falling unemployment rates, and a notable rise in digital transactions. These statistics affirm the robustness of the economy, showcasing a trajectory of growth and stability.The achievements in taxation reforms are nothing short of remarkable, with direct tax collections more than trebling in the last decade, the number of tax return filers increasing by 2.4 times, average processing time of tax returns plummeting from 93 days in FY 2013-14 to an impressive 10 days in FY 2023-24, resulting in issuance of quick refunds. These are the results of consistent progressive measures thus obviating the need for, and rightly avoiding, any last-minute populist measures.No change in existing tax rates, both for direct and indirect taxes, is a good indicator of stability and predictability for investors and taxpayers.A welcome move to waive outstanding tax demands that are minor, disputed, and unreconciled. This involves the withdrawal of outstanding direct tax demands up to Rs. 25,000 pertaining to the period up to FY 2009-10 and up to Rs.10,000 for FY 2010-11 to 2014-15.The Government's commitment to fostering a business-friendly environment is evident in its intent to extend specific tax benefits for start-ups, investments by sovereign wealth funds/ pension funds, and certain IFSC units. The extension has been made now until March 31, 2025. This might help in creating a conducive landscape for business.To align with the CBDT notification issued earlier, the provisions relating to tax collection at source concerning remittances under the Liberalized Remittance Scheme have now been formally incorporated in the Finance Bill, 2024, setting the rate at 20% for amounts exceeding Rs. 7 lakhs in a financial year.The Finance Bill, 2024 proposes an extension of the time limit for introducing the faceless scheme by the Central Government for transfer pricing proceedings, DRP Proceedings, and ITAT Proceedings, up to March 31, 2025.The interim Budget 2024 may not have proposed significant tax announcements, but it very well positioned the prelude to the full budget post the upcoming elections. Considering the potential impact on the population across the four pillars of GYAN, a sizable portion of India stands to be covered. The interim Budget’s focus on the tax front resembles a report card, highlighting the maturity achieved by our tax system. The enhancement of taxpayer services was emphasized as a key priority.","This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data and N for Nari utthan.

Interim Budget for a Viksit Bharat: It’s for everyone and all,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/interim-budget-for-a-viksit-bharat-its-for-everyone-and-all/articleshow/107497439.cms,"By Akhilesh Tuteja

The Finance Minister on February 01, 2024, delivered a truly innovative interim budget. At first glance, it did not seem like an interim budget but looked more like the budget to drive further growth and a continuum of inclusive growth-oriented investments.At the outset, this budget brings a wonderful balance between fiscal prudence and continued investment for growth.It's not easy to continue the glide path of reducing the fiscal deficit and continuing to make significant investments in all areas including infrastructure, R&D, energy transition, technology, skilling, and social welfare. The surprising reduction in fiscal deficit of 5.8% as against the budgeted 5.9% for FY24 and the projection of 5.1% in FY25 with a clear focus on increasing investments was a huge positive.This was a budget for everyone and all because it caters to every part of the Indian economy and society. The FM has carefully catered to the investment needs of various sectors. The continued focus on youth, impoverished, women and farmers to increase their involvement and contribution to economic growth is evident. By committing an 11.1% increase in capital expenditure to 11,11,111 lakh crore, the FM has clearly brought every single 1 in this growth journey.What was very impressive was the inclusion strategy of the government. The focus on women's empowerment for the past few years is unprecedented, which is reflected in the inclusion of women in the workforce moving from 23.3% to 37% in the last five years. The thirty crore Mudra Yojna loans to women entrepreneurs were a great boost to the Nari Shakti initiative. We already have over 10 million Lakhpati Didis and what is truly evident is like a corporate CFO, the FM has revised the earlier target of 20 million Lakhpati Didis to 30 million. The government also plans to invest in initiatives to encourage young girls between the ages of 9 and 14 to undertake the vaccination for cervical cancer which is again a great boost to Nari Shakti.A lot needs to be done to bring more women into all parts of economic growth but the journey so far and the vision of the future is truly inspiring.While India continues on its technological prowess and makes its mark in new technologies like Artificial Intelligence, we need a multi-pronged strategy to harness the power of AI. We need a clear focus on building AI systems in India so that we not only emerge as a global leader in this new era but can build models, which are specific to India that will benefit Indians. At the same time, we need a very wide coverage program to build skills to leverage AI to its fullest potential. The biggest contribution we can make to the inclusion of youth in the economic development of the country is by skilling them in new skill areas. In the last few years, the Skill India Mission has trained 14 million youth, reskilled over 5 million youth and established a staggering 3,000 new ITIs. The future of any country will depend as much on capital investments as on skill investments.The focus on agricultural development and support to the farmer continues through direct financial assistance to farmers. The farmers have benefited by getting crop insurance through PM Fasal Bima Yojana. It's not just the farmers, the PM-SVANidhi provides credit assistance to a large number of street vendors.The last few years have seen the journey of affordable housing through Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY). There is a slight increase in allocation to launch a scheme for encouraging the middle class to build or buy new homes. This investment will likely propel a wider economic development and increase employment.India has seen a tremendous rise in entrepreneurship in the last few years. In order to continue the journey and promote new startups, the government proposes to extend certain tax benefits, which are expiring from March 2024 to March 2025. The MSMEs have not been left behind. With a proposal to provide timely finances to such enterprises, the government has paved the way for their growth, so they can look to compete globally.All in all, it’s a truly inclusive budget with a clear focus on development not just by giving away freebies but enabling the people to participate in the economic development activity.

‘Enough domestic sources of demand to counter drag from external sector’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/enough-domestic-sources-of-demand-to-counter-drag-from-external-sector/articleshow/107372012.cms,"Do you think the

creates room for lower interest rates?

One of the issues that the Budget has flagged is the demographic challenge and opportunity and the societal change that is taking place. How do you view this?

Niti Aayog is working on the Viksit Bharat roadmap. What will be the focus areas?

You are as much a representative of the Centre as well as the states. Is it time to revisit the entire formula for transfers to states particularly on the issue of cesses and surcharges?

Suman Bery , who heads Niti Aayog , the govt think tank, is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China, which he says is also an opportunity for India. The economist is confident that Indian states remain resilient. Excerpts of the interview with TOI.The finance ministry expects the economy to grow 7% next year.Given the global situation, how do you see the prospects?The belief in the finance ministry is that we have a possible drag coming from the external sector but that we have other sources. We have enough domestic sources of demand. One has to applaud the political and economic judgment of FM in deciding that it was appropriate to pursue the path of fiscal consolidation. There is transparency. What this actually reflects is responsible economic management, which is one reason we are where we are. Second, it also creates a buffer so that there is policy space if we do encounter headwinds.That’s the hope and expectation. We have an independent central bank and an inflation targeting central bank, so it is up to the monetary policy committee to take a call through the monetary policy committee on the repo rate .The PM has said that when India grows its states grow. India is a composite of 37 states and UTs. They are each at very different points in their demographic transition. There are some states where the net replacement rate is down to 1%, like Kerala . There are others, particularly UP and Bihar, which are in their earliest stage of demographic transition and each one of these states is the size of a large European country. There are two implications of that — one is internal labour mobility and it will become an even larger part of our growth model. The govt has taken several steps to create a unified market. Our main endowment is our human capital and that has to be equipped to participate in global exchange in many ways. We know from China, Japan that the demographic dividend partly depends on markets and on human capital. But the golden period is fairly short lived, about 15 years, when the so called dependency ratio declines. The other big opportunity the PM has been highlighting is bringing women much more into the active labour force.When Niti was set up there was the idea of a three-year vision and a seven-year strategy paper. The reality is that schemes of govt tend to be aligned with the award of the Finance Commission . There are various established building blocks or hand holds which are already a matter of govt policy. The PM is much more interested in a national debate on what it means to be a Viksit Bharat or modern society. We have a collective goal and it is for the democratic polity to define what that goal should be. Its emphatically not for a super mandarin bureaucracy. It is not going to be Lee Kwan Yew’s Singapore led from the top.It’s entirely a finance ministry matter but I would be lying if I didn’t say when I visit certain states there is this complaint. A big frontier would be resource mobilisation at the state level. Second is going to be rationalisation of subsidies not only at the Union level, but also at the state level. All chief ministers sit on my governing council. When they convene as the governing council, I see them in their role as development practitioners. The world is beginning to appreciate quite how much institutional and political maturity India attained in our 75 years and the most fundamental dimension of a democracy, we have orderly transfers of power. There are enough buffers to ensure that what happens in state finances is unlikely to create macro instability. Those risks are well contained by our Constitution. The chief ministers know that they are going to be judged by development outcomes and so you can have the sugar rush of changing of pension plans or various handouts but if the cupboard is bare you are not going to be able to deliver.","Suman Bery is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China.

Government's Marathon to 2047: Emphasis on Fiscal Prudence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/governments-marathon-to-2047-emphasis-on-fiscal-prudence/articleshow/107371788.cms,"What was the thinking behind keeping the vote on account absolutely straight?

So is it the idea to keep the Budget completely transparent?

The capex has risen 11.1% and there is an emphasis on infrastructure spending. But there is also the hope that the private sector will now take over and start capital spending. Given the geopolitical situation, how confident is the govt that it will pan out as planned?

Finance secretary T V Somanathan, in an interview with TOI, says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047 . Excerpts:If you see the Budget speech you will see the emphasis on 2047. The govt has set its sight on running that marathon.Running to 2047 is a marathon , it’s not a sprint. If you are going to run a marathon, you need to be in good shape and you can’t have short-term stimulants or something that will get you some yards and then it’s done.The whole focus is on making India a developed country by 2047, for which a healthy present and a strong fiscal position is an important concomitant. Some purely short term measures don’t really fit into that picture. It’s a consistent picture: focus on the long term for which you need to build strength in the short term and that needs to be done by prudence in fiscal policy and by not doing things which can detract you from that path. Not doing the wrong thing is more important than appearing to do things.The idea is that govt finances may be good, bad or indifferent depending on the times, depending on the circumstances, depending on the policies. But what is the position should be reflected as reasonably and accurately as possible. That is an emphasis. As regards the Finance Commission, again the terms of reference that have been given to them are the terms in the Constitution.What is the means by which the devolution should be done is a matter they have full discretion. They can actually take all kinds of factors into account and in a sense we felt this time based on my review of the previous commissions that the right expression would be less is more. The shorter, less prescriptive terms of reference gives full scope for all stakeholders including state govts to express their viewpoints and for the commission to take a balanced view of the different perspectives and then come to its award. Ultimately the award of the Finance Commission is about devolution and grant for which full scope has now been given to them.n There are incipient signs of private capital expenditure accelerating. There are some surveys I have seen done by some of the chambers industry, which show high levels of investment. The PMI, which is a sort of leading indicator, is also looking pretty healthy. Capacity utilisation is one reason that private sector capital expenditure doesn’t immediately pick up when the economy starts accelerating because there is surplus capacity.But increasingly I get the sense that many industries are beginning to reach levels where they have to add capacity. When that happens capital investment will happen. Another pointer also mentioned in the Budget speech you may notice that our airlines have placed large orders for planes — that is capital expenditure.When you import 1,000 aircraft, it’s just not 1,000 aircraft, there are concomitant additions to ground handling facilities, you need airports to expand, you need to employ people to do that. That means a lot of jobs. The aircraft is capital but then look at the effect it is going to have on skilled jobs. So capital expenditure is happening. I am fairly confident that we will have decent capital expenditure in the year to come and that will become a new source of acceleration.",Finance secretary T V Somanathan says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047.

What is the Section 80C limit for tax deduction for FY 2024-25 after Interim Budget 2024?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/income-tax-budget-2024-2024-2025-section-80c-limit-epf-ppf-elss-nsc/articleshow/107353021.cms,"ALSO READ |

Income Tax Changes Budget 2024 : In the recent Budget 2024 speech, the Finance Minister kept the Section 80C tax deduction limit unchanged. The maximum limit for claiming tax benefits under Section 80C remains at Rs 1.5 lakh for the current fiscal year 2023-24 and will stay the same for individuals looking to save on taxes through Section 80C investments in the upcoming fiscal year 2024-25.Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions. Individuals can reduce their gross taxable income by up to Rs 1.5 lakh per financial year by engaging in these specific investments or expenditures.You can save on taxes through Section 80C by investing in things like Employees' Provident Fund (EPF), Public Provident Fund (PPF), Equity Linked Saving Scheme (ELSS) mutual funds, National Savings Certificate (NSC), and 5-year tax-saving fixed deposits with banks or post offices. Additionally, paying life insurance policy premiums also qualifies for tax benefits under Section 80C.It is important to note that each eligible investment comes with its specific maximum limit, rate of return, liquidity, and taxation rules for the earned returns, states ET in a report. For instance, the most you can invest in PPF in a financial year is Rs 1.5 lakh. Meanwhile, there's no limit on the amount you can invest in ELSS mutual funds, but the Section 80C deduction is capped at Rs 1.5 lakh.If individuals can't make specific investments, they can still get deductions under Section 80C from their gross taxable income through certain expenses. These expenses include repaying the principal amount of a home loan, tuition fees for children, payment of stamp duty, registration fees, and other costs related to buying a house.Since the financial year 2020-21, individuals without any business income must annually choose between the old and new tax regimes. As of the fiscal year 2023-24, the new tax regime is the default option. Consequently, individuals seeking tax deductions under Section 80C must opt for the old tax regime since this deduction isn't available in the new tax regime. It's crucial for taxpayers to be aware of these rules to make informed decisions about their tax planning and investment strategies.","Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions.

Budget 2024 focuses on youth and women entrepreneurship,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/budget-2024-focuses-on-youth-and-women-entrepreneurship/articleshow/107357923.cms,"By

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget which is an interim budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year. The budget talks about inclusive development both, social and geographical, especially for youth, women, farmers, and the poor. Continued focus on improving logistics through infrastructure spend on roads, rail, airports, ports increases productivity for companies and citizens alike.To make ‘Viksit Bharat’ by 2047, the government’s focus is on improving and empowering people’s capabilities through various skilling initiatives. It is encouraging to see that Skill India Mission has succeeded in training more than 1.4 crore youth and upskilling and reskilling 54 lakh youth. I am particularly happy to see the continued focus on youth and women entrepreneurship and the announcement of a new fund which will give interest free 50 year loans for startups will provide a domestic fillip to startups supplementing venture capital we have traditionally relied on from abroad.PM Mudra Yojana has sanctioned 43 crore loans aggregating to 22.5 lakh crore to youth entrepreneurs and thirty crore Mudra Yojana loans to women entrepreneurs. There are several other schemes like Fund of Funds, Start-Up India, and Start-Up Credit Guarantee schemes that are assisting our youth. Further, the extension of tax benefits to Start-ups and investments made by sovereign wealth funds/pension funds, till 31st March 2025 depicts the government’s effort to support the startup eco- system.This aligns quite well with India Sanitation Coalition’s efforts to give impetus to the start-up world. Over the past 7 editions of our ISC-FICCI Sanitation Awards, we have recognized and promoted several start-ups in the sanitation space, many of whom are successful businesses now!While the finance minister did not provide detailed information on Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH), the budget allocation sees a slight increase in spend demonstrating continued focus on this highly successful program. The acknowledgement that the private sector has increasingly played a substantial role in addressing WASH issues in both urban and rural areas, with numerous projects underway through Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs), highlights the government's commitment to addressing challenges in this sector.A perfect example is the LightHouse Initiative initiated by the Department of Drinking Water along with the India Sanitation Coalition (ISC) by partnering with major corporates across India to develop model villages in Solid and Liquid Waste Management (SLWM) under SBM-Grameen. From this budget, there is an expectation that the government will persist in prioritizing Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) as the path toward achieving the country's Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6). Additionally, it is hoped that the government will uphold its commitment to making necessary infrastructural investments for SLWM.The budget speech rightly celebrates the fact that we have 83 lakh SHGs and 9 crore women beneficiaries. The microfinance movement in the country and the possibility of empowering women members of SHGs through livelihood skilling is a key to bringing women into mainstream economic advancement.The focus on green growth, rooftop solar, wind, biomass, e-vehicles all help with our green energy thrust. The tourism sector was mentioned and could be a huge job provider for youth and women.Guided by the principle ‘Reform, Perform, and Transform’, the budget emphasizes efficient implementation of various policies by improving coordination with states and relevant stakeholders. This is critical both for infra spend and social programsIt is noteworthy that ISC’s Climate Resilient Coastal Cities project which is being implemented in PPP (Public-Private Partnership) mode in four coastal states of Karnataka, Gujarat, Goa and Maharashtra is congruent with the government’s priority of promoting climate-resilient activities for the blue economy 2.0, a scheme for restoration and adaptation measures, and coastal aquaculture.The budget also focuses on the Aspirational districts program where assistance will be given to the states for faster development of aspirational districts and blocks, including the generation of ample economic opportunities. This is again very crucial as it has a huge potential to transform the landscape of our country while making sure no -one is left behind.Overall, this budget has embraced economic strategies and develops the building blocks that nurture and uphold growth, promote inclusive and sustainable development, and enhance productivity.","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year.

Tuesday's feat made India the fifth stock market in the world to achieve this milestone, behind the US, China, Japan and Hong Kong.As markets closed on Tuesday, BSE's market cap stood at Rs 414.6 lakh crore, translating to $4.97 trillion . If we take into consideration the market cap of some large companies that are listed only on the NSE - like BSE and CDSL - India's total market cap will be Rs 415.2 lakh crore or $4.98 trillion.Having crossed the $4-trillion mark on Nov 29, 2023, it took India about six months to add another $1 trillion. In March 2007, when the first trillion mark was hit (see graphic), it took a little over 10 years for India to reach the $2 trillion value. Then, it crossed the $3-trillion mark in mid-May 2021.Reaching the $5-trillion market cap is a major milestone that reflects the sustained momentum of the Indian stock market, V K Vijayakumar, chief investment strategist atGeojit Financial Services , said.

New Shepard's failure in 2022

NEW DELHI: Blue Origin 's tourism rocket carried passengers to the edge of space for the first time in nearly two years, following a hiatus caused by an unsuccessful uncrewed test flight. The New Shepard rocket and capsule launched during a window opening at 8.30 am CT (9.30 am ET) from Blue Origin's facilities in West Texas. The company's website live-streamed the mission, called NS-25 , starting at approximately 7.50 am CT (8.50 am ET), according to a report from CNN.NS-25, marking Blue Origin's seventh crewed flight, transported six customers in the capsule: Mason Angel, a venture capitalist; Sylvain Chiron, founder of the French craft brewery Brasserie Mont-Blanc; Kenneth L Hess, a software engineer and entrepreneur; Carol Schaller, a retired accountant; Gopi Thotakura , an aviator; and Ed Dwight, a retired US Air Force captain chosen by President John F Kennedy in 1961 to be the nation's first Black astronaut candidate.""I had no intention of being an astronaut. That was the last thing on my bucket list,"" Dwight said in the National Geographic documentary. ""But once I was given the challenge, then everything changes,"" he added.At 90 years old, Dwight will become the oldest person to reach the edge of space, according to a Blue Origin spokesperson.During the mission, the crew experienced speeds exceeding 2,000 miles per hour, more than three times the speed of sound. The rocket-propelled the capsule beyond the Karman line, an area 62 miles (100 kilometers) above Earth's surface, widely considered the boundary of outer space. At the apex of the flight, passengers enjoyed a few minutes of weightlessness and breathtaking views of Earth through the cabin windows.The launch follows the success of an uncrewed science mission in December, marking the New Shepard program's first flight since the mishap more than a year earlier.Gopichand Thotakura, an accomplished pilot and co-founder of Preserve Life Corp, a holistic wellness center in Atlanta, became the first Indian to travel to space as a tourist. With an extensive aviation background, including commercial jet piloting, bush flying, aerobatics, seaplane, glider, and hot air balloon piloting, Thotakura brings a wealth of experience to the mission. He holds a degree from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University and an MBA in aviation/airway management and operations from Coventry University, and currently serves as the chief operating officer at Asian Infrastructure Ltd.The other crew members include Ed Dwight, who was selected by President Kennedy in 1961 to train at the Aerospace Research Pilot School but was not chosen for Nasa's astronaut team despite completing the program; Mason Angel, who runs Industrious Ventures and supports STEM education through his family's foundation; Sylvain Chiron, founder of Brasserie Mont Blanc and a lifelong pilot and skier; Kenneth L Hess, a software engineer and entrepreneur who created Family Tree Maker; and Carol Schaller, a retired CPA who has embraced adventure despite the possibility of going blind.In September 2022, a New Shepard rocket and spacecraft experienced a failure during a launch of science instruments. One minute into the flight, the rocket encountered Max Q, a moment of maximum stress on the vehicle due to the combination of high speeds and relatively thick atmosphere at low altitudes.The rocket emitted a large burst of flames, prompting the New Shepard capsule to initiate its launch abort system, safely separating from the malfunctioning rocket and parachuting to a safe landing.Blue Origin later revealed that the failure was caused by a problem with the engine nozzle, which directs the flaming exhaust at the rocket's bottom. The onboard computers detected the failure and shut down the engine, but the rocket, left without a functioning engine, crashed back to the ground and was destroyed.The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) oversaw an investigation into the failure, which revealed that the engine nozzle failed due to higher temperatures than anticipated. Blue Origin implemented design changes to the combustion chamber and adjusted operating parameters to address the issue. The FAA concluded the mishap investigation on September 27, 2023, outlining 21 corrective actions Blue Origin needed to implement before resuming flights.","Blue Origin's tourism rocket carried passengers to the edge of space for the first time in nearly two years.

Jamie Dimon: Succession at JPMorgan is ‘well on the way’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/jamie-dimon-succession-at-jpmorgan-is-well-on-the-way/articleshow/110309335.cms,"Guidance boost

Basel blasted

Mid-teens boost

Jamie Dimon has long joked that his retirement is five years away, no matter when he’s asked. But not on Monday.The chief executive officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co told shareholders the timetable is “not five years anymore,” in response to a question about how long he planned to remain CEO. The largest US bank is “well on the way” with its succession plans , he said during the firm’s investor day.The question of who might steward the firm after Dimon — who has held the top job since 2006 — has loomed over the industry. Earlier this year — about halfway through Dimon’s five-year retention package — the 68-year-old CEO moved some of his top lieutenants into new senior roles, positioning them for more experience running the firm’s operations as he prepares potential successors.The shuffle placed Jenn Piepszak and Troy Rohrbaugh atop an expanded commercial and investment bank while Marianne Lake, who had co-led the consumer and community bank alongside Piepszak since 2021, got sole control of the segment, overseeing more of its business lines.“It’s up to the board — it’s not up to me,” Dimon said on Monday. “I have the energy that I’ve always had. That’s important. I think when I can’t put the jersey on and give it my fullest, I should leave, basically.”Reviewing the days’ presentations from the leaders of JPMorgan’s various business lines, Dimon tempered expectations from some analysts that the bank’s excess capital might support increased share buybacks.“We’re not going to buy back a lot of stock at these prices,” he said, adding that the bank will be more aggressive about repurchases when its stock price declines. The shares, which closed at a record high last week, fell after his comments and ended the day 4.5% lower. They’re still up 15% this year.The bank raised its forecast for this year’s net interest income to $91 billion after last month predicting a $90 billion haul, on less than expected interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Fewer customers are also shifting money to higher-yielding accounts than anticipated, according to the bank. In the first quarter, JPMorgan had posted $23.1 billion of NII, breaking a streak of seven quarters of a record for the metric.JPMorgan also offered details of potential fallout from a proposed plan to increase capital requirements for big banks. Fed officials have indicated that the proposals, known as Basel III Endgame, will be pared back. Bloomberg reported that agencies are working on a new version that could be finalized as soon as August.Even with the potential for stricter capital requirements, JPMorgan expects to deliver a 17% return on tangible common equity over the medium term, it said in its presentation.Dimon, who has long been the most vocal critic of the Basel proposals among his Wall Street peers, reiterated his criticisms that they’ll hurt the poorest consumers, pushing some outside the banking system. Regulation is “damaging America at this point,” he said.JPMorgan earlier on Monday said that two-thirds of consumers would likely have to pay a monthly service fee for their checking accounts if the current proposals are implemented. JPMorgan said that doesn’t reflect its current plans for dealing with the rules.The regulation onslaught, as consumer and community bank CEO Lake called it during her presentation, has the potential to profoundly impact consumers, she said.“These rules have not been adequately studied, and the people who will end up being impacted the most will be everyday Americans, in particular those who can least afford it,” Lake said.As well as Lake, investors also heard from Piepszak and Rohrbaugh about progress in JPMorgan’s commercial and investment bank.JPMorgan expects the emergence of a deal rebound to help bolster investment-banking fees for the second quarter by a percentage in the “mid teens” compared with a year earlier, Rohrbaugh said.For the markets business, the increase will probably be in the “mid-single digits,” he said.","JPMorgan raised its forecast for this year’s net interest income to $91 billion after last month predicting a $90 billion haul.

ASML and TSMC can disable chip machines if China invades Taiwan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/asml-and-tsmc-can-disable-chip-machines-if-china-invades-taiwan/articleshow/110308892.cms,"NEW DELHI: ASML Holding NV and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company have ways to disable the world’s most sophisticated chipmaking machines in the event that China invades Taiwan , according to people familiar with the matter.Officials from the US government have privately expressed concerns to both their Dutch and Taiwanese counterparts about what happens if Chinese aggression escalates into an attack on the island responsible for producing the vast majority of the world’s advanced semiconductors , two of the people said, speaking on condition of anonymity.ASML reassured officials about its ability to remotely disable the machines when the Dutch government met with the company on the threat, two others said. The Netherlands has run simulations on a possible invasion in order to better assess the risks, they added.Spokespeople for ASML, TSMC and the Dutch trade ministry declined to comment. Spokespeople for the White House National Security Council, US Department of Defense and US Department of Commerce didn’t respond to emailed requests for comment.The remote shut-off applies to Netherlands-based ASML’s line of extreme ultraviolet machines, known within the industry as EUVs, for which TSMC is its single biggest client. EUVs harness high-frequency light waves to print the smallest microchip transistors in existence — creating chips that have artificial-intelligence uses as well as more sensitive military applications.China has long claimed that the island of Taiwan is its territory, with President Xi Jinping both advocating for peaceful unification and refusing to rule out a military intervention. While US officials have warned that China is seeking the capability to invade Taiwan by 2027, Taiwanese officials have downplayed the threat of an imminent invasion and officials in Beijing have said the American warnings of a timeline are baseless. The People’s Liberation Army isn’t massing troops on the coast and Xi has been primarily focused on steadying China’s economy to hit long-term development goals.About the size of a city bus, an EUV requires regular servicing and updates. As part of that, the company can remotely force a shut-off which would act as a kill switch, the people said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The Veldhoven-based company is the world’s only manufacturer of these machines, which sell for more than €200 million ($217 million) apiece.ASML’s technology has long been subject to government interventions aimed at preventing it from falling into the wrong hands. The Netherlands prohibits the company from selling EUV machines to China, for instance, because of US fears they could lend its rival an edge in the global chip war.It was at the behest of the US that the Dutch began this year to halt exports of ASML’s next-most sophisticated chipmaking machines. Even before that ban took effect, US officials had asked ASML to cancel some previously scheduled shipments to Chinese customers, Bloomberg News reported.The company expects as much as 15% of this year’s sales to China will be affected by the latest export-control measures.Evidence suggests the restrictions may have come too late to stem Chinese advances. Huawei Technologies Co. last year produced a smartphone to rival Apple Inc.’s iPhone using chips made with older ASML printers in combination with tools from two US suppliers, Bloomberg News reported in October after conducting a break-down of the phone.Beijing has made technological self-sufficiency a national priority and Huawei’s efforts to advance domestic chip design and manufacture have received government backing.The Biden administration is also looking to boost semiconductor production on American soil, promising $39 billion in grants to chipmakers to hedge against any future supply-chain disruption.The stakes are high, with around 90% of the world’s most advanced chips made in Taiwan. On May 20, Taiwan inaugurated Lai Ching-te as president in the global chip hub, putting in power a man Beijing has branded an “instigator of war.”The EUV machine has helped turn ASML into Europe’s most valuable tech stock with a market capitalization topping $370 billion — more than double that of its client Intel Corp.ASML has shipped more than 200 of these machines to clients outside China since they were first developed in 2016, with TSMC snatching up more of them than any other chipmaker.EUVs require such frequent upkeep that without ASML’s spare parts they quickly stop working, the people said. On-site maintenance of the EUVs poses a challenge because they’re housed in clean rooms that require engineers to wear special suits to avoid contamination.ASML offers certain customers joint service contracts where they do some of the routine maintenance themselves, allowing clients like TSMC to access their own machines’ system. ASML says it can’t access its customers’ proprietary data.TSMC Chairman Mark Liu hinted in a September interview with CNN that any invader of Taiwan would find his company’s chipmaking machines out of order.“Nobody can control TSMC by force,” Liu said. “If there is a military invasion you will render TSMC factory non-operable.”",ASML reassured officials about its ability to remotely disable the machines when the Dutch government met with the company on the threat. The Netherlands has run simulations on a possible invasion in order to better assess the risks. China has long claimed that the island of Taiwan is its territory.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110309115,imgsize-52658,width-400,resizemode-4/110309115.jpg"

The flurry of investment has created scores of AI models and spawned many more consumer and enterprise products in turn, all fighting for the critical mass of users needed to speed AI development.China’s tech companies have for years relied heavily on discounts across markets from e-commerce to food delivery and ride-hailing.

That was followed that same day by rounds of discounts from rival JD.com Inc.What Bloomberg Intelligence SaysAlibaba’s decision to cut pricing on its Large Language Models (LLM) by up to 97% will likely further disrupt China’s AI market, pushing the sector into a price war. The move is probably in response to ByteDance’s recently launched Doubao LLMs, which were priced at a deep discount to the market. We expect Baidu, Tencent and JD.com to respond in due course.- Robert Lea, BI analystShares in Alibaba slid 1% while Baidu dived close to 4% in Hong Kong.Chinese tech pioneers have joined Silicon Valley peers like Microsoft Corp. in placing big bets on generative AI. Beside developing their own in-house foundation models, they’re pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into up-and-coming outfits like Baichuan and Zhipu AI.Alibaba has gone through a year of tumultuous restructuring to try and claw back users for its cloud business, which also hosts its main AI effort. It stunned investors by calling off a planned spinoff of the arm into an independent, publicly traded unit.The Hangzhou-based company — now under the helm of Chief Executive Officer Eddie Wu — has focused on growing its public cloud, the domestic services arm aimed at enterprise customers.

At the time, he pledged to raise annual revenue to more than $45 billion by 2023, a target Astra met thanks to its focus on cancer drugs such as Tagrisso and Imfinzi.The company has since expanded to antibody-drug conjugates including Enhertu, a new class of drugs that deliver high medicine doses directly to tumors while minimizing damage to surrounding tissues.",AstraZeneca Plc aims to almost double sales to $80 billion by 2030.

One of the world’s largest investment banks, Morgan Stanley, has disclosed a substantial investment in Bitcoin. According to its Q1 13F disclosure, the bank has invested around $269.9 million in Bitcoin ETFs. In addition to Morgan Stanley, other G-SIBs (Global Systemically Important Banks), such as JP Morgan Chase and Wells Fargo, have also revealed their holdings in the ETF product.The growing influx of institutional investments has triggered Bitcoin’s market performance resurgence.Amid the crypto market optimism, several altcoins —Solana, KangaMoon, BNB , Toncoin and Cardano have eclipsed the performance of the pioneer cryptocurrency and are gearing up for more substantial growth in the coming months. This article will explore the top altcoins to buy now for the next bull run.KangaMoon (KANG) is first on this list as one of the top long-term crypto investments. The altcoin has managed to capture the market with its GameFi and SocialFi elements and impressive presale performance. With over $6.7M raised and a 400% ROI, KangaMoon offers a unique P2E proposition that will disrupt the altcoin market.At its core, the platform is launching an ecosystem where players meet other like-minded individuals, interact, and play battle-themed games. As a result, they win rewards and prizes in the form of KANG and rare NFTs. Unlike other altcoins, the KANG token will offer utility in the ecosystem.To clarify, users of the Kangaverse ecosystem will use $KANG to upgrade their KangaMoon characters and buy in-game items on the marketplace. What’s more interesting is its SocialFi elements, where altcoin holders can win a free token when they join to promote the project online.Currently, at its bonus stage, the KANG token is priced at $0.025. As KangaMoon continues to gain more traction, its recent activities, such as the BitMart listing announcement and RaidSharksBot partnership, highlight its potential to lead the altcoin market. The platform’s ability to draw in over 23,000 registered members, plus around 10,000 holders, and secure presale funding underscores its robust position in the ever-evolving digital currency realm.Solana, the world's fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation, has been experiencing robust market performance. Following recent crypto developments, the Solana coin has gained substantial value. Notably, Robinhood announced that it is launching a Solana staking feature in Europe.The new feature will allow Robinhood customers to stake their Solana holdings and earn rewards. Moreover, Infinex, a decentralised perpetual contract trading platform, has shown its support for the altcoin. More importantly, Solana launched its first-ever liquidity layer, MarginFi.The platform is set to provide a range of integrated yields, including natural staking yield through LST. Remarkably, the recent surge in the price of Solana also coincides with the broader positive market sentiments. With this view, Solana has become one of top altcoin to watch in the next bull run.The next altcoin to buy and hold is BNB coin. Based on its recent price performance and remarkable commitment to broader blockchain adoption, BNB Crypto is becoming a titan in the crypto market. Recently, BNB Coin partnered with the University of Zurich to promote blockchain education.The collaboration will enable sponsorship for students, allowing them to dive into the world of blockchain and learn from top-notch experts regarding the Web3 ecosystem. The community-driven programme will allow the students to equip themselves with skills that encourage them to build on blockchain technology.As seen in previous years, multiple successful projects on BNB have emerged. Despite the positive bullish news, the price of BNB has witnessed consistent bearish sentiments. However, its price is trading above its 100 and 200-day EMAs, suggesting an incoming bull run. Thus, experts see BNB coin as the one of the top cryptocurrencies to buy and hold in 2024.The Toncoin blockchain has made headlines in the broader crypto market with groundbreaking development and partnerships. Following Pantera Capital's investment in the Toncoin network, TON added substantial gains in its value in early May. Pantera Capital cited the blockchain’s PoS ecosystem’s infusion with the Telegram messaging service as a crucial factor behind the investment.Moreover, the Notcoin team announced that it was launching on TON , with a staggering 80 billion tokens airdropped to its community. This further bolstered the price of Toncoin and the total value locked (TVL) across the altcoin. Evidently, the bullish Toncoin news has triggered the demand for the TON crypto, which is attributed to overall investor confidence.Remarkably, the Toncoin price movement aligns with market optimism, but it possesses a stronger catalyst for considerable growth. With this view, many Toncoin price predictions are bullish, suggesting that the altcoin is gearing up for more astronomical gains in the coming week.Another cryptocurrency to watch in 2024 is the Cardano coin. The Proof-of-Stake blockchain has sparked speculation about its future price movement following its death cross formation, which coincided with its consistent bearish sentiment. However, Cardano's price shot up in a relief rally after the altcoin community speculated about a potential Gemini Exchange listing.Moreover, this development aligns with Charles Hoskinson's announcement regarding the new Cardano security features, which could potentially enhance dApp development in the ecosystem. The bullish Cardano news has influenced positive price movement, which is also supported by heightened trading volume.Additionally, the price of Cardano is trading above its 100 and 200-day EMAs, suggesting that the altcoin is gearing up for an incoming bull run. The recent surge is attributed to the overall market optimism and the upcoming protocol upgrades. With this view, many analysts have hinted at Cardano as the one of the top altcoins to invest in 2024.With the current bullish market mood, investors are shifting their focus from the pioneer cryptocurrency towards altcoins that have the potential to garner 100x returns in the next bull cycle. Among the top five altcoins listed above, KangaMoon stands out with its unique features and potential for higher returns.As KangaMoon continues gaining traction, it has become a prominent cryptocurrency on the market, drawing in both seasoned and new investors looking for promising altcoins with astronomical returns.Discover the exciting opportunities of the KangaMoon (KANG) presale today!Website: https://kangamoon.com/ Join our KangaMoon Community: https://t.me/kangamoonofficial","KangaMoon (KANG) is first on this list as one of the top long-term crypto investments.

China's yuan hits weakest level in 3 weeks after fix set at 3-month low,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/chinas-yuan-hits-weakest-level-in-3-weeks-after-fix-set-at-3-month-low/articleshow/110289396.cms,"SHANGHAI: China's yuan slipped to a three-week low against the US dollar on tuesday, dragged down by the country's central bank setting the official guidance at the weakest level in nearly three months as well as worsening capital outflows.A broadly stronger dollar has been putting pressure on emerging markets currencies including the yuan and some traders expect China's central bank to gradually fix the guidance rate weaker.Prior to the market's opening, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) set the midpoint rate, around which the yuan is allowed to trade in a 2% band, at 7.1069 per US dollar, the weakest level since February 28 but still around 1300 pips stronger than Reuters' estimate.The PBOC has been setting a stronger-than-expected fix for well over a year in what traders said reflected official efforts to stem any sharp, destabilising falls in the yuan. Traders at Citi said the PBOC could look to slowly move the fix down towards the 7.11-7.12 per dollar levels over the coming weeks, effectively keeping the US currency underpinned.The spot yuan opened at 7.2350 per dollar and touched a three-week low of 7.2419 in early trade on tuesday. It was changing hands at 7.2360 at midday, 18 pips weaker than the previous late session close and 1.82% away from the midpoint. The currency is down 1.9% this year, pressured by its relative low yields versus other currencies and a struggling property sector.Maybank analysts said in a note that the yuan's weakness could be linked to data showing capital outflows worsening in April. They also noted the tempering of optimism over China's latest housing rescue plan on concerns of insufficient funding to clear a massive stock of housing inventory.The global dollar index rose to 104.654 from the previous close of 104.565. Market participants are waiting on the release of minutes from the US federal reserve's last meeting to gauge its policy path.
