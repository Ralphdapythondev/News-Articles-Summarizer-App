India’s stock value tops $5 trillion as Modi’s win powers rally,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/indias-stock-value-tops-5-trillion-as-modis-win-powers-rally/articleshow/111071763.cms,"India’s stock market value exceeded $5 trillion for the first time, with the latest boost coming from a commitment by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s new coalition for policy continuity in the world’s fastest-growing major economy.The country’s equity market has joined the ranks of the US, China, Japan and Hong Kong after topping the threshold last week, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It took India about six months to add the latest $1 trillion to the capitalization of companies listed on its exchanges.Indian stocks have been scaling new peaks since the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party secured sufficient support from key allies to form a coalition government , ensuring Modi’s return to power for a third straight term. The victory, alongside robust economic growth and a recent upgrade of India’s ratings outlook by S&P Global Ratings, are combining to burnish India’s appeal for global investors.The formation of the new government with most key ministers retaining their portfolios “broadly affirms policy continuity,” according to Goldman Sachs strategist Sunil Koul. India remains a market with exceptionally stable macroeconomics and earnings growth is expected to continue, driving stocks higher, Koul said in a Bloomberg Television interview last week.A distinctive feature of gains in recent years has been the extent to which millions of young Indians have taken to equity investments. Local funds, including banks and insurers, have bought more than $26 billion in shares this year, while foreigners offloaded about $3.4 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.“The once dominant foreign institutional investors are no longer the sole drivers of the market,” according to Bino Pathiparampil, head of research at Mumbai-based Elara Capital.Still, off-shore interest have started to return following the outcome of the elections.“There appears ample money on the sidelines waiting to be deployed into India from foreign regional funds and India dedicated funds,” said Chetan Seth, a strategist at Nomura Holdings Inc. “Foreigners have not been able to get enough of India largely due to concerns around valuations and are still underweight.”India’s benchmark NSE Nifty 50 Index closed at a fresh all-time high on Friday and is headed for an unprecedented ninth-straight year of gains. The shares of smaller and mid-sized companies have also been rallying and outperformed their larger peers in recent years to account for about 40% of the total market valuation.

The sources told Reuters that a reduction in personal tax could boost consumption and increase savings for the middle class. The first source mentioned that individuals earning over Rs 15 lakh ($17,960.42) annually, up to a certain undetermined amount, may receive some tax relief.

The changes could be made to the new income tax regime introduced in 2020, where annual income up to Rs 15 lakh is taxed at rates between 5% and 20%, while earnings over Rs 15 lakh are taxed at 30%.

The second source pointed out that the personal tax rate increases six-fold when an individual's income rises from Rs 300,000 to Rs 15 lakh, which they described as ""quite steep.""

The government may also consider lowering personal tax rates for annual incomes of Rs 10 lakh, according to the first source. They added that a new threshold is being discussed for income taxed at the highest rate of 30% under the old tax system.

The second source noted that any loss of tax income to the government through tax cuts could be partially offset by increased consumption from this category of income earners.

Budget 2024 income tax expectations: The Modi government is mulling over the possibility of reducing personal tax rates for specific groups of individuals, according to two government sources who spoke to Reuters. This move has the potential to stimulate consumption in India, which is the third-largest economy in Asia.The sources, who requested anonymity due to the confidential nature of budget discussions, indicated that the plan might be unveiled in July when Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman presents the first Union Budget following the Modi 3.0 government.Also Check | Income Tax Slabs FY 2024-25 Explained: New Tax Regime Vs Old Tax Regime - What are the tax rates, slabs & surcharge rates?

Snowflake’s taking AI to where data resides: CEO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/snowflakes-taking-ai-to-where-data-resides-ceo/articleshow/110955730.cms,"It has been about four years since Snowflake entered the Indian market. How has the journey been so far?

How has the rise of GenAI impacted cloud-based data storage and analytics service businesses?

You have just announced Snowflake Cortex Analyst and Cortex Search…

Where else do you see Gen AI having an impact?

You say that Snowflake LLM Arctic with its mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture allows AI models to be built faster and at a fraction of the cost of traditional methods. How does it do this?

How do you see the adoption of Gen AI-based products in enterprises?

SAN FRANCISCO: “We receive five billion queries on our Data Cloud every day,” says Sridhar Ramaswamy, CEO of Snowflake, the cloud-based data platform that provides data storage, processing, and analytics solutions. The number is significant, considering Google receives an average of 8.5 billion search requests every day. Ramaswamy was speaking at the firm’s ‘Snowflake Summit 2024’ in San Francisco earlier this week, where the company announced a slew of new technologies that “take AI to where data resides”. The company also announced a tie up with Nvidia that will allow Snowflake customers and partners to build AI-powered applications. Ramaswamy, an IIT Madras alumnus who was in Google for over 15 years and who was appointed CEO of Snowflake in Feb, spoke to TOI on the sidelines of the summit. Excerpts:Snowflake operates in two buckets in India. One is with India-based customers like Swiggy, Urban Company, and Piramal Capital, so they can unlock the full value of their data. The second pertains to the trend of American companies moving their core infrastructure to India. We are investing heavily in having a presence in India, in training more people on Snowflake. Companies like Morgan Stanley, for example, have their very senior staff in India taking care of data operations using Snowflake. We have close to 500 people in our Pune centre of excellence, and a lot more expansion is to come.Generative AI is going to have an impact from bottom to top in the stack. For example, there’s a Snowflake feature that transcribes videos, and after indexing the text, you can create a chatbot based on it. And the thing that people are most excited about is that instead of getting a bunch of links, you get answers. We also help them get grounded, cited answers, so that they know where the answers are coming from. Our value prop at Snowflake is to create a single unified product, where things like AI are tightly integrated, and we see ourselves as more an AI Data Cloud.Cortex Analyst is a bit of a North Star for the business analytics area — it will let a business user talk to their data and get answers back. If a business user asks an unreasonable question, the product will say ‘no’. As soon as you give people a chatbot, they start asking ridiculous things like ‘what is my revenue going to be 15 years from now’. A piece of SQL is certainly not going to give you that information. I generally see AI as an enhancer for data access and visualisation. Cortex Analyst is all about asking natural language questions of structured data. Cortex Search is about getting documents indexed so that you can create a chatbot very easily.In cleaning data, for instance. Data has always been messy. There’s no magic wand making sure that you have clean data. For example, think about all the documents that you have consumed. Whenever you search, for example, you are going to run into outdated documents. Making sure that these are marked as outdated or updated will be an ongoing event. We see language models helping with several of these problems. Companies currently spend millions of dollars every year just on data engineering – for cleaning up data, and getting it into a good place.Just like standard AI models, MoE is a stack of parameters, one on top of each other. There are often 24 to 32 layers of neurons that are different kinds of behaviour and connections. In dense models like GPT-3, when a new token (unit of input like a word, an image, etc) comes in for training, it ends up affecting every parameter (GPT-3 has approximately 175 billion parameters) at every layer. For instance, you take a sentence, mask a word in it, and ask the model to predict the word by feeding this sentence in. In the process, every token ends up affecting all parameters and this just makes it computationally expensive to update the model to train on a large amount of data. With MoE, you do an arbitrary subdivision of the token space and, during training, you will have portions of the neural network that get activated for different buckets of tokens (instead of having to impact all the parameters). So, you end up constructing models that are a combination of dense networks that are activated for every token, and sparse experts that are activated only partially. Now, this process can end up producing models that are almost as good as the dense models, but for a smaller amount of compute. And, you can train models faster and more efficiently.Canva, Zoom and Bayer and many others are harnessing Cortex AI to create applications and drive productivity. We have several hundred others building applications to talk to their enterprise data with natural language for business-critical decision making.","Sridhar Ramaswamy is CEO of Snowflake, a cloud-based data platform that provides data storage, processing, and analytics solutions.

Baltimore's busy port fully reopens after bridge collapse, and a return to normal is expected

Port of Baltimore fully reopened after Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse, restoring normal shipping traffic. Gov. Wes Moore announced the reopening at a news conference. Shipping companies rerouted cargo to other ports during the cleanup.

NEW DELHI: Signalling a significant improvement in efficient handling of ships and cargo in recent years, nine Indian ports have made it to the top 100 rankings (in list of 405 ports) in the Container Port Performance Index 2023 (CPPI 2023) of the World Bank. Govt-owned Visakhapatnam ranked 19th, first time for an Indian port making it to top 20. Adani-owned Mundra ranked 27.In 2022, Visakhapatnam port ranked 115 and Mundra’s ranking was 48. The improvement is a milestone for India’s maritime industry , officials in the ports and shipping ministry said. The Indian ports have achieved this by enhancing their operational efficiency and service delivery.Officials said Visakhapatnam port has demonstrated good performance on parameters, such as 27.5 moves per crane hour, a turnaround time (TRT) of 21.4 hours, and minimum berth idle time. These highlight the port’s ability to handle container ships efficiently and influence customer preferences.The seven other ports which were ranked within 100 were Pipavav (41), Kamarajar (47), Cochin (63), Hazira (68), Krishnapatnam (71), Chennai (80) and Jawahal Lal Nehru (96).The index prepared by the World Bank and S&P Global Market Intelligence is a comparable assessment of performance based on vessel time in ports. Yangshan port in China and Salalah port in Oman were top two ports in terms of rankings .“The average duration of a port call (time taken to load or unload at least one container) in 2023 was 40.5 hours, which represents a slight increase over the global average of 36.8 hours in 2022. About 11.7% (or 3.7 hours) was idle time consumed at the berth immediately before and after cargo operations. Also known as the ‘Start-Up’ and ‘Finish’ sub-processes of a port call, each activity does not necessarily need to take more than 30 minutes to complete safely,” said the report.","Nine Indian ports have made it to the top 100 rankings (in list of 405 ports) of the World Bank.

The finance minister set the stage for a ""Viksit Bharat by 2047"", on the core principles of ‘Sabka Saath’, ‘Sabka Vikas’, ‘Sabka Vishwas’, with ‘Sabka Prayas’ being added as a new theme in the interim Budget.This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data i.e., farmer welfare and N for Nari utthan i.e., support for women entrepreneurs. These form the pillars of a comprehensive inclusive development. The Government's commitment to sustainable development under the strategy for Amrit Kaal includes achieving 'Net Zero' by 2070, rooftop solarization for one crore households and robust health initiatives.The Indian economy's resilience takes center stage amidst positive indicators of declining current account deficit as a percentage of GDP, falling unemployment rates, and a notable rise in digital transactions. These statistics affirm the robustness of the economy, showcasing a trajectory of growth and stability.The achievements in taxation reforms are nothing short of remarkable, with direct tax collections more than trebling in the last decade, the number of tax return filers increasing by 2.4 times, average processing time of tax returns plummeting from 93 days in FY 2013-14 to an impressive 10 days in FY 2023-24, resulting in issuance of quick refunds. These are the results of consistent progressive measures thus obviating the need for, and rightly avoiding, any last-minute populist measures.No change in existing tax rates, both for direct and indirect taxes, is a good indicator of stability and predictability for investors and taxpayers.A welcome move to waive outstanding tax demands that are minor, disputed, and unreconciled. This involves the withdrawal of outstanding direct tax demands up to Rs. 25,000 pertaining to the period up to FY 2009-10 and up to Rs.10,000 for FY 2010-11 to 2014-15.The Government's commitment to fostering a business-friendly environment is evident in its intent to extend specific tax benefits for start-ups, investments by sovereign wealth funds/ pension funds, and certain IFSC units. The extension has been made now until March 31, 2025. This might help in creating a conducive landscape for business.To align with the CBDT notification issued earlier, the provisions relating to tax collection at source concerning remittances under the Liberalized Remittance Scheme have now been formally incorporated in the Finance Bill, 2024, setting the rate at 20% for amounts exceeding Rs. 7 lakhs in a financial year.The Finance Bill, 2024 proposes an extension of the time limit for introducing the faceless scheme by the Central Government for transfer pricing proceedings, DRP Proceedings, and ITAT Proceedings, up to March 31, 2025.The interim Budget 2024 may not have proposed significant tax announcements, but it very well positioned the prelude to the full budget post the upcoming elections. Considering the potential impact on the population across the four pillars of GYAN, a sizable portion of India stands to be covered. The interim Budget’s focus on the tax front resembles a report card, highlighting the maturity achieved by our tax system. The enhancement of taxpayer services was emphasized as a key priority.","This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data and N for Nari utthan.

Interim Budget for a Viksit Bharat: It’s for everyone and all,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/interim-budget-for-a-viksit-bharat-its-for-everyone-and-all/articleshow/107497439.cms,"By Akhilesh Tuteja

The Finance Minister on February 01, 2024, delivered a truly innovative interim budget. At first glance, it did not seem like an interim budget but looked more like the budget to drive further growth and a continuum of inclusive growth-oriented investments.At the outset, this budget brings a wonderful balance between fiscal prudence and continued investment for growth. It's not easy to continue the glide path of reducing the fiscal deficit and continuing to make significant investments in all areas including infrastructure, R&D, energy transition, technology, skilling, and social welfare. The surprising reduction in fiscal deficit of 5.8% as against the budgeted 5.9% for FY24 and the projection of 5.1% in FY25 with a clear focus on increasing investments was a huge positive.This was a budget for everyone and all because it caters to every part of the Indian economy and society. The FM has carefully catered to the investment needs of various sectors. The continued focus on youth, impoverished, women and farmers to increase their involvement and contribution to economic growth is evident. By committing an 11.1% increase in capital expenditure to 11,11,111 lakh crore, the FM has clearly brought every single 1 in this growth journey.What was very impressive was the inclusion strategy of the government. The focus on women's empowerment for the past few years is unprecedented, which is reflected in the inclusion of women in the workforce moving from 23.3% to 37% in the last five years. The thirty crore Mudra Yojna loans to women entrepreneurs were a great boost to the Nari Shakti initiative. We already have over 10 million Lakhpati Didis and what is truly evident is like a corporate CFO, the FM has revised the earlier target of 20 million Lakhpati Didis to 30 million. The government also plans to invest in initiatives to encourage young girls between the ages of 9 and 14 to undertake the vaccination for cervical cancer which is again a great boost to Nari Shakti.A lot needs to be done to bring more women into all parts of economic growth but the journey so far and the vision of the future is truly inspiring.While India continues on its technological prowess and makes its mark in new technologies like Artificial Intelligence, we need a multi-pronged strategy to harness the power of AI. We need a clear focus on building AI systems in India so that we not only emerge as a global leader in this new era but can build models, which are specific to India that will benefit Indians. At the same time, we need a very wide coverage program to build skills to leverage AI to its fullest potential. The biggest contribution we can make to the inclusion of youth in the economic development of the country is by skilling them in new skill areas. In the last few years, the Skill India Mission has trained 14 million youth, reskilled over 5 million youth and established a staggering 3,000 new ITIs. The future of any country will depend as much on capital investments as on skill investments.The focus on agricultural development and support to the farmer continues through direct financial assistance to farmers. The farmers have benefited by getting crop insurance through PM Fasal Bima Yojana. It's not just the farmers, the PM-SVANidhi provides credit assistance to a large number of street vendors.The last few years have seen the journey of affordable housing through Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY). There is a slight increase in allocation to launch a scheme for encouraging the middle class to build or buy new homes. This investment will likely propel a wider economic development and increase employment.India has seen a tremendous rise in entrepreneurship in the last few years. In order to continue the journey and promote new startups, the government proposes to extend certain tax benefits, which are expiring from March 2024 to March 2025. The MSMEs have not been left behind. With a proposal to provide timely finances to such enterprises, the government has paved the way for their growth, so they can look to compete globally.All in all, it’s a truly inclusive budget with a clear focus on development not just by giving away freebies but enabling the people to participate in the economic development activity. While the FM calls the comprehensive GDP - Governance, Development & Performance – to me, this budget is inclusive of another GDP – gender, demography, and professions.","Akhilesh Tuteja is Partner and Head, Clients and Markets, KPMG in India.

‘Enough domestic sources of demand to counter drag from external sector’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/enough-domestic-sources-of-demand-to-counter-drag-from-external-sector/articleshow/107372012.cms,"Do you think the

creates room for lower interest rates?

One of the issues that the Budget has flagged is the demographic challenge and opportunity and the societal change that is taking place. How do you view this?

Niti Aayog is working on the Viksit Bharat roadmap. What will be the focus areas?

You are as much a representative of the Centre as well as the states. Is it time to revisit the entire formula for transfers to states particularly on the issue of cesses and surcharges?

Suman Bery , who heads Niti Aayog , the govt think tank, is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China, which he says is also an opportunity for India. The economist is confident that Indian states remain resilient. Excerpts of the interview with TOI.The finance ministry expects the economy to grow 7% next year. Given the global situation, how do you see the prospects?The belief in the finance ministry is that we have a possible drag coming from the external sector but that we have other sources. We have enough domestic sources of demand. One has to applaud the political and economic judgment of FM in deciding that it was appropriate to pursue the path of fiscal consolidation. There is transparency. What this actually reflects is responsible economic management, which is one reason we are where we are. Second, it also creates a buffer so that there is policy space if we do encounter headwinds.That’s the hope and expectation. We have an independent central bank and an inflation targeting central bank, so it is up to the monetary policy committee to take a call through the monetary policy committee on the repo rate .The PM has said that when India grows its states grow. India is a composite of 37 states and UTs. They are each at very different points in their demographic transition. There are some states where the net replacement rate is down to 1%, like Kerala . There are others, particularly UP and Bihar, which are in their earliest stage of demographic transition and each one of these states is the size of a large European country. There are two implications of that — one is internal labour mobility and it will become an even larger part of our growth model. The govt has taken several steps to create a unified market. Our main endowment is our human capital and that has to be equipped to participate in global exchange in many ways. We know from China, Japan that the demographic dividend partly depends on markets and on human capital. But the golden period is fairly short lived, about 15 years, when the so called dependency ratio declines. The other big opportunity the PM has been highlighting is bringing women much more into the active labour force.When Niti was set up there was the idea of a three-year vision and a seven-year strategy paper. The reality is that schemes of govt tend to be aligned with the award of the Finance Commission . There are various established building blocks or hand holds which are already a matter of govt policy. The PM is much more interested in a national debate on what it means to be a Viksit Bharat or modern society. We have a collective goal and it is for the democratic polity to define what that goal should be. Its emphatically not for a super mandarin bureaucracy. It is not going to be Lee Kwan Yew’s Singapore led from the top.It’s entirely a finance ministry matter but I would be lying if I didn’t say when I visit certain states there is this complaint. A big frontier would be resource mobilisation at the state level. Second is going to be rationalisation of subsidies not only at the Union level, but also at the state level. All chief ministers sit on my governing council. When they convene as the governing council, I see them in their role as development practitioners. The world is beginning to appreciate quite how much institutional and political maturity India attained in our 75 years and the most fundamental dimension of a democracy, we have orderly transfers of power. There are enough buffers to ensure that what happens in state finances is unlikely to create macro instability. Those risks are well contained by our Constitution. The chief ministers know that they are going to be judged by development outcomes and so you can have the sugar rush of changing of pension plans or various handouts but if the cupboard is bare you are not going to be able to deliver.","Suman Bery is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China.

Government's Marathon to 2047: Emphasis on Fiscal Prudence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/governments-marathon-to-2047-emphasis-on-fiscal-prudence/articleshow/107371788.cms,"What was the thinking behind keeping the vote on account absolutely straight?

So is it the idea to keep the Budget completely transparent?

The capex has risen 11.1% and there is an emphasis on infrastructure spending. But there is also the hope that the private sector will now take over and start capital spending. Given the geopolitical situation, how confident is the govt that it will pan out as planned?

Finance secretary T V Somanathan, in an interview with TOI, says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047 . Excerpts:If you see the Budget speech you will see the emphasis on 2047. The govt has set its sight on running that marathon. Running to 2047 is a marathon , it’s not a sprint. If you are going to run a marathon, you need to be in good shape and you can’t have short-term stimulants or something that will get you some yards and then it’s done.The whole focus is on making India a developed country by 2047, for which a healthy present and a strong fiscal position is an important concomitant. Some purely short term measures don’t really fit into that picture. It’s a consistent picture: focus on the long term for which you need to build strength in the short term and that needs to be done by prudence in fiscal policy and by not doing things which can detract you from that path. Not doing the wrong thing is more important than appearing to do things.The idea is that govt finances may be good, bad or indifferent depending on the times, depending on the circumstances, depending on the policies. But what is the position should be reflected as reasonably and accurately as possible. That is an emphasis. As regards the Finance Commission, again the terms of reference that have been given to them are the terms in the Constitution.What is the means by which the devolution should be done is a matter they have full discretion. They can actually take all kinds of factors into account and in a sense we felt this time based on my review of the previous commissions that the right expression would be less is more. The shorter, less prescriptive terms of reference gives full scope for all stakeholders including state govts to express their viewpoints and for the commission to take a balanced view of the different perspectives and then come to its award. Ultimately the award of the Finance Commission is about devolution and grant for which full scope has now been given to them.n There are incipient signs of private capital expenditure accelerating. There are some surveys I have seen done by some of the chambers industry, which show high levels of investment. The PMI, which is a sort of leading indicator, is also looking pretty healthy. Capacity utilisation is one reason that private sector capital expenditure doesn’t immediately pick up when the economy starts accelerating because there is surplus capacity.But increasingly I get the sense that many industries are beginning to reach levels where they have to add capacity. When that happens capital investment will happen. Another pointer also mentioned in the Budget speech you may notice that our airlines have placed large orders for planes — that is capital expenditure.When you import 1,000 aircraft, it’s just not 1,000 aircraft, there are concomitant additions to ground handling facilities, you need airports to expand, you need to employ people to do that. That means a lot of jobs. The aircraft is capital but then look at the effect it is going to have on skilled jobs. So capital expenditure is happening. I am fairly confident that we will have decent capital expenditure in the year to come and that will become a new source of acceleration.",Finance secretary T V Somanathan says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047. The capex has risen 11.1% and there is an emphasis on infrastructure spending.

Income Tax Changes Budget 2024 : In the recent Budget 2024 speech, the Finance Minister kept the Section 80C tax deduction limit unchanged. The maximum limit for claiming tax benefits under Section 80C remains at Rs 1.5 lakh for the current fiscal year 2023-24 and will stay the same for individuals looking to save on taxes through Section 80C investments in the upcoming fiscal year 2024-25.Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions. Individuals can reduce their gross taxable income by up to Rs 1.5 lakh per financial year by engaging in these specific investments or expenditures.You can save on taxes through Section 80C by investing in things like Employees' Provident Fund (EPF), Public Provident Fund (PPF), Equity Linked Saving Scheme (ELSS) mutual funds, National Savings Certificate (NSC), and 5-year tax-saving fixed deposits with banks or post offices. Additionally, paying life insurance policy premiums also qualifies for tax benefits under Section 80C.It is important to note that each eligible investment comes with its specific maximum limit, rate of return, liquidity, and taxation rules for the earned returns, states ET in a report. For instance, the most you can invest in PPF in a financial year is Rs 1.5 lakh. Meanwhile, there's no limit on the amount you can invest in ELSS mutual funds, but the Section 80C deduction is capped at Rs 1.5 lakh.If individuals can't make specific investments, they can still get deductions under Section 80C from their gross taxable income through certain expenses. These expenses include repaying the principal amount of a home loan, tuition fees for children, payment of stamp duty, registration fees, and other costs related to buying a house.Since the financial year 2020-21, individuals without any business income must annually choose between the old and new tax regimes. As of the fiscal year 2023-24, the new tax regime is the default option. Consequently, individuals seeking tax deductions under Section 80C must opt for the old tax regime since this deduction isn't available in the new tax regime. It's crucial for taxpayers to be aware of these rules to make informed decisions about their tax planning and investment strategies.","Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions.

Fitch raises India's growth forecast to 7.2%,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/fitch-raises-indias-growth-forecast-to-7-2/articleshow/111096173.cms,"NEW DELHI: Fitch Ratings on Tuesday raised India's growth forecast for the current fiscal to 7.2%, from 7% projected in March, saying elevated consumer confidence will drive spending, besides increased investments.In June update to its global economic outlook report, Fitch said it expects inflation to decline to 4.5% by end of this year and RBI to cut policy interest rates by 25 basis points to 6.25%. ""We expect the Indian economy to expand by a strong 7.2% in FY24/25 (an upward revision of 0.2pp from the March GEO),"" Fitch said in its global economic outlook report.Investment will continue to rise but more slowly than in recent quarters, while consumer spending will recover with elevated consumer confidence, it said. For the fiscal years 2025-26 and 2026-27, Fitch projected growth rates of 6.5% and 6.2%, respectively.Fitch's estimates for FY25 are in line with that of RBI which earlier this month projected Indian economy to expand 7.2% in the current fiscal on the back of improving rural demand and moderating inflation.

The unprecedented demand this summer season - following record high temperatures across many parts of the country - has also meant supply shortage and scarcity of critical on-ground manpower, all of which have seen prices shooting up 6-8% in June due to costlier inputs.Summer this year has been torturous and demand at record high, say executives at some of the top companies such as Voltas, LG and Llyod. This has meant that supplies - both of fully-built products as well as components - are short.Industry officials say that the demand surge has taken the industry - and even the supply chain - by surprise, leading to shortages. ""There is short supply of even the manpower on the ground for installation and service. Costs have gone up here too. Many companies are also shifting their stocks from south India - where temperatures are getting better - to the north where heat still remains strong,"" an official said.The strong demand is now becoming a dampener for the heat-harried consumers as prices have gone up. ""The input costs have gone up from all angles, and we had no option but to raise prices,"" a top official with a leading company said. ""At the higher scale, the prices have increased by 6-8%, while some companies, which still have stock in the market, are trying to absorb the costs to some extent to keep the momentum going.""""This year has been a golden year for the AC industry. We are very bullish on sales even in the month of June as temperatures are still very high across many states. We are witnessing exceptional growth,"" said Sanjay Chitkara, senior VP at LG Electronics India.Sunil Vachani, president of Consumer Electronics and Appliances Manufacturers Association (CEAMA), said the industry is expected to grow by 30-40% this year. ""We expect sales at 15 million units in 2024, against the around 11.5 million units that we did last year.""On shortages and pressures on costs, Vachani said that freight and commodity prices are up. ""Hopefully, the industry will be better prepared next year. These types of temperatures are likely to continue, with global warming being a grim reality.""Voltas, one of the top players in the AC category, said it has been able to manage the stocks on better preparation ahead of the season. ""Our supplier base and ancillary base is very strong... (this) has helped us achieve significant growth over the last six months,"" Pradeep Bakshi, MD & CEO of Voltas, said.Bakshi said the company's recent investments in expanding greenfield and brownfield capacities for key product categories like ACs and commercial refrigerators are on track. It will add one million unit capacity in Tamil Nadu for ACs and 2.5 lakh units for commercial refrigeration in Gujarat. ""We have already made significant investments in capital expenditure across our facilities in Gujarat and Tamil Nadu.

Sebi is dealing with F&O trading frenzy: RBI governor,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sebi-is-dealing-with-fo-trading-frenzy-rbi-governor/articleshow/111093917.cms,"Mumbai: RBI and markets regulator Sebi have discussed the huge volumes in the futures and options (F&O) segment, amid concerns raised by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman and senior govt officials.""The volumes in the F&O market are very large, perhaps larger than the nominal GDP. We have discussed the matter with Sebi, and they are dealing with it,"" RBI governor Shaktikanta Das said at ET Now Leadership Dialogues.The governor said that the Financial Stability and Development Council's sub-committee, chaired by him with Sebi and other financial regulators as members, had an early warning group to address issues causing discomfort. This group was examining the rise in F&O volumes. Futures allow investors to take positions on the expected price of a stock or a commodity, while with options investors have the choice to buy or sell at the pre-offered price.Sitharaman had flagged the increasing participation of retail investors in the segment as a worry. ""An unchecked explosion in retail trading in the futures and options market can create future challenges for the market, investor sentiment, and household finances,"" she had said last month.F&O trading is seen as a tool to make quick money in the stock markets, but Sebi data released last year showed that 89% of the people were losing money. That has not deterred investors from getting into the speculative segment of the market with derivatives turnover on NSE soaring 30 times from Rs 247.5 lakh crore in March 2020 to Rs 7,218 lakh crore in March 2024.Das, however, gave his vote of confidence to the markets regulator. Responding to a query on whether the financial sector was outpacing the real economy due to higher market capitalization compared to GDP, the governor said all the parameters and indicators of the Indian economy and the financial sector looked stable. ""What you are implying is whether some segment is getting overheated. Sebi is fully seized of what is happening in the stock market,"" he said.The governor's comments came amid a report by Reuters that Sebi is tweaking rules for derivative trading which would result in higher margins for options contracts.Das said that if RBI has any thoughts on areas that are not under the central bank's domain, RBI shares its thoughts with Sebi. He said RBI keeps an eye on all segments of the credit markets. ""We took action in the unsecured loan sector and bank lending to NBFCs. Wherever there is a likelihood of stress, if matters are left unattended, we have acted pre-emptively, and credit growth in all these areas has moderated,"" said Das.At the event, SBI chairman Dinesh Khara said that capital formation was crucial for sustained growth. Responding to a question on the impact of savings moving to the capital markets, Khara said, ""Money going to the capital market should lead to capital creation, not froth. Money with the banks leads to capital formation.""Das said that RBI was continuing with its stance on withdrawal of accommodation given the slow pace of disinflation, which he attributed to recurrent food price hikes, which could get worse with slightly adverse weather.","The volumes in the F&O market are very large, perhaps larger than the nominal GDP.

Severe weather won't halt trading at Hong Kong stock exchange,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/severe-weather-wont-halt-trading-at-hong-kong-stock-exchange/articleshow/111073278.cms,"Hong Kong's stock exchange, in a bid to enhance its competitiveness as an international financial center like Shenzhen and Shanghai, will soon be able to continue operations during typhoons and heavy storms.The development is set to take effect on September 23 as announced by the city's leader, John Lee , on Tuesday. The decision comes amidst an increase in the frequency and intensity of tropical storms in southern China, attributed to climate change.Currently, the Hong Kong bourse typically suspends trading when a strong typhoon signal or ""black rainstorm warning"" is hoisted, resulting in several lost trading days each year. However, with the new policy, investors will be able to trade as usual even during inclement weather conditions.""From September 23 investors can trade as usual when the typhoon signal number eight or above is hoisted in Hong Kong, or even during a black rainstorm warning. Shenzhen and Shanghai are now trading in bad weather. There is no reason why Hong Kong, as an international financial centre, should not follow suit. Non-stop trading in inclement weather can strengthen the competitiveness of the Hong Kong Exchange,"" said John Lee.Additionally, Katerine Kou, chair of the Hong Kong Securities Association, said that discussions on this move had been ongoing for a year, given Hong Kong's role as a connector between the Chinese and global markets. She believes that this change will help Hong Kong score more points and enhance its global competitiveness.Last year, Hong Kong raised its highest T10 warning for only the 16th time since World War II and experienced the heaviest rainfall in nearly 140 years, causing widespread flooding and disruption.According to a consultation paper from the city's bourse, the exchange was impacted by severe weather four times in 2023, including three full-day market suspensions, with investors being unable to manage their portfolios and are exposed to potential market risks, especially when the markets of their underlying positions remain open.The September timeframe for implementing the new policy is intended to give the industry sufficient time to prepare for the change.","Hong Kong's stock exchange will soon be able to continue operations during typhoons and heavy storms.

Tit-for-tat: China opens anti-dumping probe into European pork,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/tit-for-tat-china-opens-anti-dumping-probe-into-european-pork/articleshow/111067318.cms,"NEW DELHI: On Monday, China's commerce ministry announced the initiation of an anti-dumping investigation into imported pork and its by-products from the European Union, with a focus on Spain , the Netherlands, and Denmark. This move appears to be a response to the European Commission's decision to impose anti-subsidy duties of up to 38.1% on imported Chinese cars starting from July.The investigation, which will commence on June 17, was triggered by a complaint filed by the China Animal Husbandry Association on behalf of the domestic pork industry. The probe will cover pork intended for human consumption, including fresh, cold, and frozen whole cuts, as well as pig intestines, bladders, and stomachs. Global food companies are now on high alert for potential retaliatory tariffs from China.Spain, the top supplier of pork to China, has stated through its pork producers group Interporc that they will fully cooperate with the investigation. ""The EU and China have plenty of time to reach agreements,"" Interporc said in a statement. European pork producers are expected to continue exporting to China tariff-free during the investigation, pending a decision and tariff announcement by the Chinese authorities.The Chinese commerce ministry has set a deadline of June 17, 2025, for the completion of the investigation, with a possible six-month extension if necessary. The Danish Agriculture & Food Council has warned that the country's pork sector would be ""hit incredibly hard"" by any restrictions on sales to China. Pork suppliers from South America, the United States, and Russia could potentially gain market share if Beijing decides to restrict imports from the European Union.The European Commission has expressed confidence in the face of China's investigation, with a spokesperson stating that the EU would intervene appropriately to ensure the investigation complies with all relevant World Trade Organisation rules. The EU accounts for more than half of the approximately $6 billion worth of pork China imported in 2023, with Spain, the Netherlands, and Denmark being the top three suppliers.The growing concern over Chinese industrial overcapacity flooding the EU with cheap products, including electric vehicles, is opening a new front in the West's trade war with Beijing. The EU's trade policy is becoming increasingly protective against the global ramifications of China's production-focused, debt-driven development model. Governments typically impose anti-dumping duties on imported goods when they suspect the item in question is being sold for less than its production cost, in order to protect domestic firms.","China's commerce ministry announced the initiation of an anti-dumping investigation into imported pork and its by-products from the European Union.

This is the most expensive city for expats in 2024,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/this-is-the-most-expensive-city-for-expats-in-2024/articleshow/111062064.cms,"NEW DELHI: Moving to a different city or country for work and opportunity is necessary but not always easy. And there's no denying that one of the major factors when deciding to shift one's base is the cost of living . But which city is the costliest to live in around the globe?According to a new list by Mercer , 2024 cost of living survey for international workers, Hong Kong has taken the top spot again. Hong Kong was also named the most costliest city in the last two years. Following Hong Kong, the second priciest city is the financial hub of Singapore.New York fell one spot to land in seventh place. London took the spot in the top 10 at eighth place, rising nine spots since last year’s ranking.Employees who work across borders, whether on long-term assignments or frequent international trips, are directly experiencing the effects of economic shifts, the Mercer report said.Inflation and exchange-rate fluctuations are directly affecting the pay and savings. Mercer’s report also mentioned that the rising housing costs and “volatile inflation trends” were putting pressure on expat workers’ compensation packages.Of the 10 most expensive cities for expats , half are located in Western Europe, with Switzerland being home to four.Dubai has jumped up the rankings to become the costliest city in the Middle East. It is ranked 15th on the global ranking, up three places from 2023.The European cities also once again dominate the list of the world's most costly places to reside. High-priced cities in Europe encompass Copenhagen, securing the 11th spot, followed by Vienna at 24th, Paris at 29th, and Amsterdam rounding off at 30th place.The presence of multiple European cities in the upper echelons of the cost-of-living index highlights the region's generally elevated expenses for residents.The inclusion of several Swiss cities, in particular, underscores the nation's notoriously high living costs. London's entry into the top 10 further emphasises the city's status as one of Europe's most expensive urban centers.Mercer measured the comparative cost of more than 200 items and services — including housing, transport, food, clothing and household goods — to come up with its ranking of 226 cities.","According to a new list by Mercer, 2024 cost of living survey for international workers, Hong Kong has taken the top spot again.

"Institutional investors stock up on altcoins, fueling speculation of bull run",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/institutional-investors-stock-up-on-altcoins-fueling-speculation-of-bull-run-5-altcoins-set-to-moon/articleshow/111059765.cms,"Angry Pepe Fork ranks among top altcoins

Bullish momentum drops for the Ethereum price

Chainlink Price faces bearish pressure

Toncoin trading volume increases

Avalanche Price Prediction

Role of institutional investors

Institutional investors are finding altcoins as important assets to invest in while speculations about the impending bull run continue. Moreover, the cryptocurrency community is excited and anticipatory as institutional giants stock up on a wide variety of altcoins such as Ethereum , Chainlink, Toncoin, Avalanche, and Angry Pepe Fork, setting the stage for an explosive price increase.With its revolutionary Conquer To Earn model, Angry Pepe Fork (APORK) introduces a unique innovation by establishing a gamified staking system that rewards long-term network contributions and broad user engagement. Because it provides a variety of flexible staking options to suit different risk tolerance profiles, it turns ownership from a passive investment into an active value-generating process.Users can customise their involvement according to their desired APORK rewards by staking their tokens for 30, 60, or 90 days. With a current market value of only $0.014 in the first presale stage, the altcoin has a 100x growth potential because of the interest from institutional investors which will result in a price surge, making it an attractive opportunity for early investors to receive a high rate of return.Furthermore, with a 1.9 billion token supply cap, APORK enforces token scarcity in contrast to inflationary tokens. Combining this with the fact that APORK is built on the high-performance Solana blockchain, which enables quick and affordable transactions, makes it a competitive alternative to some other top altcoins that are purely speculative.Angry Pepe Fork is garnering a lot of investors’ attention because of its collective earning model, which gives all community members a piece in the project's success. Additionally, the project's limited token supply ensures its long-term viability and rewards early adopters and backers. Meanwhile, if you are a fan of Angry Pepe Frog or you missed out on the native Pepe coin, APORK will be of great interest to you.The cryptocurrency community is still waiting on S-1 approval to start tradingEthereum ETFs , even though the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved a spot Ethereum ETF. Some remarks are now expected this week, according to a source who is in contact with the SEC. Analyst Nate Geraci stated in a post on X that the regulatory body will be providing comments to at least one of the multiple potential issuers who applied this week.Notably, spot Ethereum ETFs issuers had expected an update from the regulatory body regarding the status of their application ever since the May 31 deadline for submitting the first draft of S-1 registrations passed. Nothing concrete has emerged from the Gary Gensler-led commission thus far. Meanwhile, the bullish momentum on the Ethereum price has dropped as the altcoin is currently trading below $3,500 levels.Many altcoins were severely impacted by the altcoin depression, which struck in the worst circumstances to date. The majority of the most popular altcoins, including Chainlink, were trending upwards last week until the US labour reports were released on Friday. May brought more jobs than expected, and after the uptrend declined, the Chainlink coin owners sold off their holdings.Due to the sell-off, the Chainlink price is currently trading at a seven-day loss of 16%. Holders of the Chainlink coin were expecting a surge up to the $33 resistance before the bearish hit; at the moment, Chainlink is only stabilising at roughly $15.The blockchain concept started by the Telegram team is continued by Toncoin. Legal problems forced Telegram to halt the project, but the Toncoin blockchain is now in charge. Telegram also includes the TON Space wallet and other solutions powered by Toncoin in its messenger. Recent cooperation between Toncoin and the Oobit mobile payment app increases its usefulness. At millions of stores worldwide, users can now make Toncoin payments.Moreover, the $200 million USDT that was recently issued on the Toncoin blockchain improves its useful applications even more and enables quick cryptocurrency payments. Meanwhile, the 24-hour Toncoin trading volume has also increased by over 20% to reach $278.8 million.The Avalanche coin saw sharp price swings through 2024, although in March, it broke the previous record of $60 set in May 2022. Meanwhile, partly because of the alliances and advancements within the ecosystem, the Avalanche coin has become a well-known alternative cryptocurrency. Although the Avalanche ecosystem has been progressing, Avalanche has especially raised doubts among investors about its future course.As of right now, the Avalanche price prediction suggests an increase in the price of the altcoin by 226.26% to reach $103.86 by July 11, 2024. Technical signs point to a bearish sentiment at the moment. Avalanche had 12 out of 30 (40%) green days and a 30-day price volatility of 6.05%. Meanwhile, Avalanche is expected to cost as much as $149.49 in 2025.With their degree of credibility, liquidity, and capital infusion, institutional investors are essential to the altcoin market and can have a big influence on how these digital assets develop. With more interest in Angry Pepe Fork by institutional investors, the altcoin is poised for a rally. These are a few main ways that institutional investors affect altcoins:1. Market validation: The potential of an altcoin is powerfully validated when institutional investors join the altcoin market. Their engagement tells other investors—institutional and individual—that the asset is developing and deserving of notice.2. Increased liquidity: Large-volume trading by institutional investors can greatly boost liquidity in the altcoin market. All participants can trade more smoothly and price stability depends on this liquidity.3. Price impact: The amount of institutional investments can significantly affect the price of altcoins. Big buy orders can push prices higher, generating good momentum and drawing in more investment from individual traders.4. Diversification strategies: Generally speaking, institutional investors have highly developed diversification plans designed to reduce risk and optimise returns. Through the possibility of diversification beyond conventional assets like stocks and bonds, altcoins enable institutions to disperse their risk across several asset classes.5. Long-Term investment horizon: Institutional investors frequently have longer investment horizons than do many retail investors. Being less likely to panic sell during market downturns, their entrance into the altcoin market can bring stability and sustainability.Overall, institutional investors contribute credibility, liquidity, and stability which are essential to forming the altcoin market. Their engagement advances the general expansion and maturity of the altcoin ecosystem in addition to reflecting the increasing confidence in the potential of alternative currencies.Disclaimer: The above content is non-editorial, and TIL hereby disclaims any and all warranties, expressed or implied, relating to the same.

It alone spent $51.5 billion which is more than more than all other nuclear-armed countries combined.China and Russia followed as the next highest spenders, with $11.8 billion and $8.3 billion respectively.The report also highlighted a rise in Britain's nuclear weapons spending for the second consecutive year, with a 17 percent increase to $8.1 billion.""I think it is fair to say there is a nuclear arms race under way,"" ICAN chief Melissa Parke told AFP.Additionally, another report by The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri) suggests that these nations are infusing more funds to modernize and deploy new weapons.It further reports that while the total estimated number of nuclear warheads worldwide slightly decreased to 12,121 from 12,512 at the beginning of this year from a year earlier, 9,585 were held in stockpiles for potential use, with 2,100 maintained in a state of ""high operational alert"" on ballistic missiles.The United States and Russia held nearly all of these warheads, but China was also believed to have some warheads on high alert for the first time.""While the global total of nuclear warheads continues to fall as Cold War-era weapons are gradually dismantled, regrettably we continue to see year-on-year increases in the number of operational nuclear warheads,"" said Sipri director Dan Smith.","World's nine nuclear-armed states collectively spent $91 billion on their arsenals last year, $10.8 billion more than the previous year.

Herinckx said, ""Nike does not want their products to be shipped to Russia,"" but added, ""They are also not telling us not to do it.""According to a report from Reuters, both Nike and Lego informed that they have not authorized Herinckx's imports of their products to Russia. Reuters discovered that Herinckx's business obtains branded goods, including Nike and Lego, by using intermediaries with no apparent connection to Russia as buyers, then shipping the goods to Russia, often via Turkey, and finally delivering them to retailers in Russia.While Western governments' restrictions have primarily targeted industrial products that could be used to build weapons for Russia's war machine, companies like Herinckx's are indirectly supporting the Russian economy by providing consumers with access to foreign goods they have grown accustomed to since the collapse of communism. Customs data analysed by Reuters revealed that the value of Nike products imported to Russia plummeted 81% in 2022 to $21 million but rebounded in 2023 to at least $74 million.Legal specialists suggest that seeking recourse under Russian law would be challenging for Western brands, leaving few other legal options for enforcing intellectual property rights typically tied to the territory where the infringement occurred. The availability of Western brands allows Russian President Vladimir Putin to ""project a message that the war does not undermine the 'normal life' of the Russian middle class,"" according to Russian economist Sergei Guriev.","Wijnand Herinckx, a 40-year-old Dutch citizen residing in Moscow, has established a thriving business that supplies Russian consumers with Western goods from companies that have withdrawn from Russia.
