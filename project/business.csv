How RBI’s record Rs 2.1 lakh crore dividend payout to government may help improve India’s credit rating,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/how-rbis-record-rs-2-1-lakh-crore-dividend-payout-to-government-may-help-improve-indias-credit-rating/articleshow/110425577.cms,"The record Rs 2.1 lakh crore dividend that the government will receive from the Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) is a positive development, as it is nearly double the amount budgeted from all financial institutions combined.Several factors could have contributed to the record profit, including the significant increase in interest rates in the United States, where the RBI invests a substantial portion of its $644 billion foreign exchange reserves (Rs 54 lakh crore), says says a TOI analysis by Mayur Shetty.Additionally, the RBI has been actively buying and selling dollars this year compared to the previous year, as foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have been selling equities. Furthermore, the RBI's money market operations have played a role in its earnings. To combat inflation, the RBI has maintained liquidity in a deficit mode, providing opportunities to lend to banks.RBI serves as both a regulatory body and a monetary authority, responsible for managing the money supply and overseeing foreign exchange markets. To stabilize the rupee against speculative inflows, RBI accumulates foreign currency reserves.Also Read | Explained: How RBI managed to give the highest ever Rs 2.1 lakh crore dividend payout to government During challenging times, such as the global financial crisis or the pandemic, central banks expanded their balance sheets through quantitative easing, which involves injecting money into the economy by purchasing bonds from banks.As a result, RBI earns profits from interest on domestic and foreign bonds, as well as from market operations. In its forex operations, RBI sells dollars it purchased during times of surplus when there is a scarcity, making a substantial profit as these sales are at prevailing market prices.However, generating profits is not the primary goal for RBI. The surpluses are a byproduct of RBI working towards its objectives of maintaining financial and market stability.It is often observed that RBI generates more profits during difficult times because it is during crises that the central bank's intervention in forex and money markets intensifies.Also Read | Why RBI is stocking up aggressively on gold reserves; central bank buys 1.5 times more gold in Jan-April than entire 2023 Profit cannot be an objective for the central bank in its market operations, as RBI is the biggest insider in the market.While the RBI can create money, the dividends it pays to the government come from its actual earnings. A significant portion of these earnings is derived from higher interest income on foreign securities and profits from selling foreign exchange. This record surplus could aid India in improving its credit rating , the TOI analysis says.According to S&P, this additional amount is approximately 0.35% of the GDP. Assuming all other factors remain constant, this windfall would reduce the fiscal deficit by that percentage. S&P has indicated that if the government uses the funds to reduce its deficit (by reducing borrowing), it would increase the likelihood of a ratings upgrade.An upgrade would enhance India's standing among global investors, which is a positive sign for markets as it would attract capital inflows. Alternatively, if the government decides to use the windfall to stimulate the economy or provide relief to the poor, it would also be beneficial, as it would boost consumption.The bond market is rallying due to record revenues generated through dividends and the Goods and Services Tax (GST), leading markets to anticipate a significant decrease in government borrowing. When the government borrows less, more funds become available for corporate borrowers, causing interest rates to decline. As interest rates fall, existing bonds that offer higher rates are sold at a premium.","The record Rs 2.1 lakh crore dividend that the government will receive from the Reserve Bank of India is a positive development, as it is nearly double the amount budgeted from all financial institutions combined. Several factors could have contributed to the record profit, including the significant increase in interest rates in the United States.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110435441,imgsize-1225804,width-400,resizemode-4/110435441.jpg"
Will Indian IT companies be forced to exit H-1B visa program? Steep fee hike to make significant dent in pockets,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/will-indian-it-companies-be-forced-to-exit-h1-b-visa-program-steep-fee-hike-to-make-significant-dent-in-pockets/articleshow/110379349.cms,"H1-B Visa Fee Hike

The US H-1B visa fee hike has raised concerns among industry representatives and immigration experts, who warn that it could pose significant challenges for Indian IT service providers and strain their finances.Indian IT companies heavily depend on H-1B visas to bring thousands of highly skilled professionals to the US to fill specialty positions that are in high demand but short supply in the country, according to an ET report by Annapurna Roy.In April, the USCIS implemented substantial fee increases for various immigration processes . The H-1B visa registration fee saw a staggering 2050% increase, rising from $10 to $215, while the application fee increased by 70%, from $460 to $780. Additionally, a $600 asylum fee was introduced for filing H-1B and other petitions, which experts argue is unrelated to non-immigrant work visas like H-1B.""The drastic percentage increase and added asylum fee all at once makes things difficult,"" said Shivendra Singh, vice president - global trade and development at industry association Nasscom .According to an analysis by the National Foundation for American Policy, the visa fee hikes could result in employers spending over $33,000 in legal and government fees for each H-1B visa petition filed for initial employment or employment extension.Jonathan Wasden, managing attorney at immigration litigation firm Wasden Law, warned that the new rules might force Indian IT companies to withdraw from the visa process altogether.Unlike product companies such as Apple and Google, or banking institutions that may only file one H-1B petition every three years, these IT firms are likely to incur significantly higher costs due to the need to file petitions more frequently.Also Read | Why Indian IT’s reliance on H-1B work visas has plunged 56% in the last 8 years Wasden believes that this is a deliberate attempt by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services to eliminate Indian IT companies from the H-1B program, stating, ""It is no secret to anyone who practices employment-based business immigration that USCIS has been trying for decades to eliminate Indian IT companies from the H-1B program. This is merely the latest tactic to achieve this goal,"" Wasden told ET. ""They are trying to make the process so expensive for companies doing third-party placement that they will go out of business,"" he added.Wasden represents US industry body IT Serve Alliance, one of the plaintiffs challenging the fee rule in court.Nasscom also expressed concerns about the impact of the fee hikes on their member companies. Shivendra Singh says that the increase in filing fees comes at a time when there is a significant demand-supply gap in skills availability. He warned that any measure that complicates and raises the cost of addressing this gap could have a substantial impact on the ease of doing business and adversely affect the competitiveness of the US economy.Also Read | Why Infosys’ Narayana Murthy wants to be remembered ‘not as a good man but…’ In addition to the fee hikes, Singh pointed out that the proposed modernisation rule provisions, which aim to narrow the criteria for 'specialty occupation' and H-1B employees staffed at third parties, could have serious consequences if implemented in the future.While some experts believe that the fee hikes will lead to a decrease in the use of H-1B visas over time, others suggest that companies will continue to bear the costs to secure the skills they desperately need. Cyrus Mehta, managing partner at immigration law firm Cyrus D Mehta & Partners PLLC, noted that Indian heritage companies have started to absorb the fee increase, viewing it as a cost of doing business in the US.However, he also cautioned that the fee increase could become a burden, particularly for India-born workers caught up in green card backlogs, as H-1B extensions will need to be filed repeatedly on their behalf.","In April, the USCIS implemented substantial fee increases for various immigration processes.

Goldilocks scenario for gold! Why it’s the right time to buy gold,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/goldilocks-scenario-for-gold-why-its-the-right-time-to-buy-gold/articleshow/110381856.cms,"Gold Funds

Gold price outlook : The current circumstances appear to be ideal for gold, and overlooking its appeal could be a costly mistake for investors seeking to safeguard their wealth.Central banks in emerging markets are accumulating gold reserves as tensions persist in West Asia, enhancing the metal's status as a reliable store of value. Additionally, the near certainty of an extended pause in US interest rates further bolsters the case for gold, says an ET analysis by Prashant Mahesh.Tapan Patel, fund manager - commodities at Tata Asset Management, advises, ""Investors could increase their allocation to gold from 8-10% to 10-15%, over the next three months, given the positive outlook for gold.""Gold prices have experienced a significant upswing in recent times, outperforming the Nifty 50 over a 5-year period with a return of 17.39% compared to the Nifty's 15.24%. However, gold underperformed over a 10-year period, yielding a return of 9.02% against the Nifty 50's 13.3%. In the last three months, gold prices have surged by 19%, and over the past year, they have risen by 22.8%.Financial advisors highlight several factors that could drive gold prices higher and recommend that investors accumulate the precious metal during any price dips in the coming three months.The US Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased by 0.3% in April, following advances of 0.4% in March and February. This suggests that inflation has resumed its downward trend at the beginning of the second quarter.Ghazal Jain, a fund manager at Quantum Mutual Fund, warns that any escalation in geopolitical tensions, fiscal or monetary measures to bolster the economy before the US elections, and the recently announced deceleration in Fed balance sheet reductions could adversely affect inflation, maintaining gold's relevance.Also Read | When will gold prices hit the Rs 2 lakh mark? Patel adds that gold prices will remain robust due to significant purchases by central banks, particularly China, Turkey, and Russia. The Ukraine invasion raised concerns about the risks associated with US dollar exposure for many nations.As a result, central banks globally are actively accumulating gold to diversify their reserves and reduce their reliance on the US dollar. In China, retail investors are also purchasing gold, further increasing demand for the precious metal. Prior to 2020, when the Chinese government cracked down on real estate, it was one of the most favored forms of savings for retail investors. With the local property market falling out of favor, investors have shifted their focus to gold.Also Read | Gold prices surge! Why 9-Carat gold jewellery may now be hallmarked Anup Bhaiya, managing director of Money Honey Financial Services, advises, ""Retail investors could stagger their bets in 3-4 tranches using a buy on dip strategy, instead of buying at one go.""He suggests that investors in higher tax brackets could use a combination of sovereign gold bonds and multi-asset funds to build their exposure in a tax-efficient manner, while those whose income is not subject to tax could opt for gold ETFs or gold funds. Some multi-asset funds are taxed as equity funds, while others are eligible for capital gains tax with indexation benefits if held for three years.","Central banks in emerging markets are accumulating gold reserves as tensions persist in West Asia.

Adani Enterprises erases all stock losses sparked by Hindenburg report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/adani-enterprises-erases-all-stock-losses-sparked-by-hindenburg-report/articleshow/110384146.cms,"Shares of Adani Enterprises Ltd, the flagship of the Adani group, have erased all the losses inflicted by a scathing short-seller report in early 2023, after the conglomerate cut debt and landed major projects.The stock clawed back losses of more than $30 billion that came after US-based Hindenburg Research alleged wide-ranging corporate malfeasance and share-price manipulation at the ports-to-power conglomerate in January 2023. The group has repeatedly denied those allegations.The flagship’s stock rose 1.7% to 3,445.05 in Mumbai on Friday and has now almost tripled since its nadir in February 2023. The latest upswing comes as some analysts expect Adani Enterprises’ stock to be included in the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex Index in June, potentially bringing passive flows.Other Adani companies are engaging with global investors to raise fresh debt as the group pushes ahead with plans to expand its cement and copper businesses. Besides Adani Enterprises, at least five of the 10 listed Adani group stocks are trading above the levels seen before the Hindenburg report .“There are a handful of groups in India that can undertake big projects and Adani Group has taken the leadership position,” said Abhay Agarwal, a fund manager with Mumbai-based Piper Serica Advisors Pvt. “Investors are looking at Adani group as a policy play and since there is a clear direction on the country’s policy, we are seeing recovery.”Shares of Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd. and Adani Power Ltd. have been among the best performers this year among the group companies, adding more than 35% each while television broadcaster New Delhi Television Ltd. has been the biggest laggard, giving away 5.5%.Back in January 2023, the short seller Hindenburg’s bombshell report saw Adani Enterprises scrap a $2.4 billion equity offering — which was then poised to be India’s largest follow-on share sale — amid a stock meltdown that at one point eroded more than $150 billion from the group’s market value. It also wrecked the personal wealth of Gautam Adani while the short seller’s claims set off regulatory probes in India.The group is now less than $30 billion away from returning to the market value it commanded on the eve of the short seller report.The first leg of the recovery in Adani stocks came in March last year after star emerging-market investor Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners bought shares worth almost $2 billion in four of the group firms, including the flagship, from an Adani family trust.

Mukesh Ambani sets sights on Africa with telecom venture,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/mukesh-ambani-radisys-corp-ril-jio-ril-telecom-venture/articleshow/110449646.cms,"Asia’s richest man Mukesh Ambani is set to enter Africa with a telecoms venture, seeking to win mobile broadband customers in a high-growth market.Radisys Corp , a unit of Ambani-controlled Reliance Industries Ltd, will provide key network infrastructure, applications and smartphones for Ghana-based Next-Gen InfraCo., according to Harkirit Singh, the executive director of NGIC . He described the plans ahead of NGIC’s launch announcement on Monday in Mumbai, India’s financial hub.NGIC, which is planning to begin operations by the end of this year, will provide 5G broadband services to mobile operators and internet services providers in Ghana.The company “is based on a premise of building affordable digital services in emerging markets,” Singh told Bloomberg News.Other strategic partners in NGIC include Nokia Oyj, Indian outsourcer Tech Mahindra Ltd. and Microsoft Corp., which has increasingly sharpened its focus on the telecoms business following an acquisition of two cloud networking firms in 2020.Ghana, a West African country with a population of just over 33 million, has three main operators: MTN Ghana, Vodafone Ghana and state-run AirtelTigo. NGIC’s strategic partners, its technological prowess and the company’s possession of Ghana’s only 5G license will help it build broadband services at scale, a huge expense for individual mobile carriers, Singh said.Two African telecoms firms — Ascend Digital Solutions Ltd. and K-NET — hold a combined stake of 55% in the new company, said Singh. The Ghana government will own just under 10% of NGIC, while local mobile operators and private investors will retain the remaining shares in the firm. Singh is also the chief executive of Ascend.NGIC has the exclusive right to offer 5G services in Ghana for a decade, though its license is valid for 15 years. The company’s capital expenditure for three years is $145 million, according to Singh.The company is looking to emulate the success of Ambani’s Jio Infocomm Ltd in India. Jio launched telecoms services in India in late 2016 with low-cost data and free voice calling, forcing some rivals to shut down and others to consolidate. It is widely credited for making mobile data affordable to hundreds of million of Indians. Jio is currently India’s biggest mobile operator with 470 million users.NGIC will provide “affordable mobile broadband services and devices to the people of Ghana, replicating the success of India’s low-cost mobile data revolution,” Ghana’s Minister for Communications and Digitalization Ursula Owusu-Ekuful said in a statement.The Reliance-NGIC partnership is also a diplomatic win for India, which has sought to counter China’s surging influence in Africa via measures such as digital inclusion.None of the strategic partners, including Reliance, currently own any equity in NGIC. But the company will give them an option to accept part of their payments as equity in the future, Singh said.“First we have to be successful to show the value that we create before they come in,” Singh said. “That’s the discussion we’re having with them.”","Radisys Corp will provide key network infrastructure, applications and smartphones for Ghana-based Next-Gen InfraCo.

Dalal Street braces for volatility as Lok Sabha elections enter last leg,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/dalal-street-braces-for-volatility-as-lok-sabha-elections-enter-last-leg/articleshow/110445245.cms,"MUMBAI: Dalal Street investors are likely to face volatility this week with the final phase of Lok Sabha elections ending on June 1. Foreign investors may continue selling despite the booster from RBI's record Rs 2.1 lakh crore dividend to govt even as domestic institutions are seen supporting the market, as has been the trend in the past few weeks.The sensex and Nifty scaled new life-time highs last week. Since April 18, on the eve of the first phase of Lok Sabha elections, the two indices have seen increased volatility. The volatility index has risen nearly 70% - a level not seen since Sept 2022, even as the sensex has gained 2,921 points (4%) while Nifty is up 961 points (4.4%) in the period. The sensex closed the week at 75,410 points while Nifty was at 22,957.The recent rally in the stock market came despite substantial volatility, mainly on the back of strong selling by foreign funds, market players said. So far in May, foreign portfolio investors have net sold stocks worth a little over Rs 22,000 crore, CDSL data showed.In contrast, domestic institutional investors have net pumped in nearly Rs 40,800 crore so far in the current month, BSE data showed. This is what has led to the up move in the leading indices, market players said.According to V K Vijayakumar, chief investment strategist, Geojit Financial Services, the selling by FPIs - which began as a trickle in April and turned into a flood in May - was triggered by the massive outperformance of Chinese stocks in recent months, which in turn led to a 'sell India, buy China trade'. ""The (Lok Sabha) election-related jitters too might have influenced FPI selling,"" he said.Vijayakumar, however, feels that the situation is once again slowly changing and market players feel that the ruling BJP-led govt will come back to power on June 4. ""Also, the massive selling (by FPIs) has eased and they have even turned buyers in recent days. Going forward, as clarity emerges on the election front, FPIs are likely to buy in India since they cannot afford to miss the post-election results rally. Actually, the rally may begin even before the election results,"" he said in a note.Among the stocks, Adani Ports & SEZ and Wipro would be among the large caps to watch out for in the next week. This is after the BSE, after markets closed on Friday, announced the inclusion of the Adani group firm into sensex while excluding Wipro from it, effective June 24. Usually, after such rejigs, investors tend to buy the stock that's being included into the index while they sell the one being excluded.In addition to poll results, global cues and the final phase of the earnings season would decide the market's trend in the coming few days, said Ajit Mishra of Religare Broking.","The sensex and Nifty scaled new life-time highs last week.

"India, Indonesia stand out for emerging markets investors in aging world",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/india-indonesia-stand-out-for-emerging-markets-investors-in-aging-world/articleshow/110449893.cms,"Structural Reforms

Emerging markets such as India and Indonesia, whose populations are growing at a solid pace, stand to benefit as demographics begin to play a bigger role in investment decisions, according to Fidelity International and BlackRock Investment Institute.The investors are focusing on the two nations in emerging Asia, thanks in part to an expected boom in infrastructure spending, which in turn bodes well for the countries’ economies. Both India and Indonesia coincidentally had elections this year, showcasing to the world their ambition to transition into major economic powerhouses with their dynamic population a key strength.The two countries stand out at a time when rapid aging has plagued peers in the region, including China. India surpassed China as the world’s most populous nation in mid-2023, a historic milestone that unleashed a rush to identify potential winners in the South Asian nation’s stock market.BlackRock’s analysis shows a positive relationship between a country’s working-age population growth and share-price valuations, while Fidelity sees the financial sector as a key beneficiary as credit needs grow for both corporates and consumers.“India and Indonesia’s labor forces are young — with demographic dividends that far outshine some of the largest economies in the neighborhood,” said Ian Samson, a fund manager at Fidelity in Singapore. “All companies big and small require financing. This in part explains why bank stocks generally correlate with GDP growth in emerging markets.”India and Indonesia are projected to see population gains of at least 10% from this year by 2040, according to data from the World Bank, while China will likely see shrinkage of nearly 4%.A more important metric would be changes in the working-age population, defined as those between 15 and 64 years old. Even before the historic overall population decline in China, its working-age cohort had been shrinking for years, while India’s is the youngest among major economies.A faster increase in the working-age group typically translates into higher future earnings growth, BlackRock Investment Institute strategists led by Jean Boivin wrote in March, adding that migration, greater labor-force participation and automation are also factors at play.The demographic dividend forms part of the optimism that has fueled gains in the two stock markets, alongside a slew of idiosyncratic factors including hopes for a market-supportive election outcome.The Nifty 50 Index, which is trading at record levels, is set to notch nine-straight years of gains if the trend holds. The Jakarta Composite Index touched an all-time high in March.Analysts note that structural reforms to reduce regulatory red tape, enhance job market flexibility and facilitate foreign investment are essential for economies to capitalize on the demographic tailwind.“Ultimately, the growth equation is employment times productivity,” said Fidelity’s Samson. “The solid structural reforms we have seen in both India and Indonesia will allow for sufficient job creation to benefit from the demographic dividend.”While there’s been some progress, more needs to be done. Indonesia’s President-elect Prabowo Subianto, who takes office in October, aims to achieve 8% annual economic GDP growth despite the nation’s track record that falls far below that.Investors are watching whether state governments in India will follow through with implementing labor, land and other policy changes that have been passed at the national level. Should Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s party win a slimmer majority in the polls, his plans for more extensive reforms will face hurdles and financial market volatility may rise.For investors of sovereign debt, the age-dependency ratio — which shows the ratio of those considered too old or too young to work — and fiscal burden are among metrics to consider for long-term investment.Global funds have poured $5.5 billion into India’s bonds this year on index-inclusion prospects, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Investors took comfort that India’s interim budget announced in February focused on infrastructure spending, instead of populist policies ahead of the general election that began in April.In comparison, international investors have pulled out $1.8 billion from Indonesia’s notes as the incoming administration’s pledges to boost spending raised concern about fiscal health.“Aging population increases the cost of healthcare and pensions, with developed-market economies having more comprehensive social benefits as compared to most EM economies,” said Sanjay Shah, a director of fixed income at HSBC Global Asset Management. “In EM economies, the burden of pension plans may be more staggered and less fixed benefit oriented,” thereby reducing the state funding burden, Shah said.","India and Indonesia are projected to see population gains of at least 10% from this year by 2040. The two countries stand out at a time when rapid aging has plagued peers in the region.

In the interview, Lee repeated his earlier comment that he personally hoped to partially lift the ban in June or at least provide investors a timeline on when and under what conditions it would be lifted.

Shipments to Russia jump but exporters are wary of sanctions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/shipments-to-russia-jump-but-exporters-are-wary-of-sanctions/articleshow/110445313.cms,"NEW DELHI: Russia's war with Ukraine and the consequent sanctions helped push the export of engineering goods , machinery and machine parts as well as aircraft spares from India during the last financial years, while traditional items such as pharmaceuticals, tea, coffee and tobacco stagnated or fell.While trade bodies say there is tremendous interest to import goods from India , the fear of sanctions and reluctance of banks to complete the transactions have made exporters wary of pushing their goods. But industry experts believe that some of the goods to Russia may be routed via UAE, which has significantly benefited from the tension in Ukraine and Russia.Thanks to massive oil imports, Russia has emerged as India's fourth largest trading partner with total trade estimated at $65.7 billion. After China, India had the second highest trade deficit with Russia, pegged at over $57 billion. Although there has been a buzz about recent moves to allow Russian exporters, who receive the payment in rupees, to invest more freely, the norms have always been there since RBI put in place the mechanism. There have also been several trade missions to explore export opportunities in Russia, some of which can use the rupee balances.But exporters are shy, arguing that banks are reluctant. ""Most Indian banks don't want to take up this business, fearing possible sanctions,"" said a large Indian exporter.While Russian entities such as SberBank are willing to route funds through their Indian branch, domestic players want to avoid these transactions. ""My advice to fellow exporters has been to route all exports through a small subsidiary so that the other parts of the business are not exposed to any sanctions,"" said another exporter, who has stopped all business with Russia for the last two years. A German buyer is, however, sourcing goods from this exporter and then exporting to Russia.Sectors such as auto components had seen a lot of interest post-sanctions but the exposure of Indian companies to American buyers and global car giants has seen them stay away.Latest official data showed that in 2023-24, exports to Russia climbed over 35% to $4.3 billion, when India's cumulative goods exports were more than 3% lower. Of the $1.2 billion increase, nearly a half was on account of machines and machine parts, including electronics.","Russia has emerged as India's fourth largest trading partner with total trade estimated at $65.7 billion.

The finance minister set the stage for a ""Viksit Bharat by 2047"", on the core principles of ‘Sabka Saath’, ‘Sabka Vikas’, ‘Sabka Vishwas’, with ‘Sabka Prayas’ being added as a new theme in the interim Budget.This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data i.e., farmer welfare and N for Nari utthan i.e., support for women entrepreneurs.These form the pillars of a comprehensive inclusive development. The Government's commitment to sustainable development under the strategy for Amrit Kaal includes achieving 'Net Zero' by 2070, rooftop solarization for one crore households and robust health initiatives.The Indian economy's resilience takes center stage amidst positive indicators of declining current account deficit as a percentage of GDP, falling unemployment rates, and a notable rise in digital transactions. These statistics affirm the robustness of the economy, showcasing a trajectory of growth and stability.The achievements in taxation reforms are nothing short of remarkable, with direct tax collections more than trebling in the last decade, the number of tax return filers increasing by 2.4 times, average processing time of tax returns plummeting from 93 days in FY 2013-14 to an impressive 10 days in FY 2023-24, resulting in issuance of quick refunds. These are the results of consistent progressive measures thus obviating the need for, and rightly avoiding, any last-minute populist measures.No change in existing tax rates, both for direct and indirect taxes, is a good indicator of stability and predictability for investors and taxpayers.A welcome move to waive outstanding tax demands that are minor, disputed, and unreconciled. This involves the withdrawal of outstanding direct tax demands up to Rs. 25,000 pertaining to the period up to FY 2009-10 and up to Rs.10,000 for FY 2010-11 to 2014-15.The Government's commitment to fostering a business-friendly environment is evident in its intent to extend specific tax benefits for start-ups, investments by sovereign wealth funds/ pension funds, and certain IFSC units. The extension has been made now until March 31, 2025. This might help in creating a conducive landscape for business.To align with the CBDT notification issued earlier, the provisions relating to tax collection at source concerning remittances under the Liberalized Remittance Scheme have now been formally incorporated in the Finance Bill, 2024, setting the rate at 20% for amounts exceeding Rs. 7 lakhs in a financial year.The Finance Bill, 2024 proposes an extension of the time limit for introducing the faceless scheme by the Central Government for transfer pricing proceedings, DRP Proceedings, and ITAT Proceedings, up to March 31, 2025.The interim Budget 2024 may not have proposed significant tax announcements, but it very well positioned the prelude to the full budget post the upcoming elections. Considering the potential impact on the population across the four pillars of GYAN, a sizable portion of India stands to be covered. The interim Budget’s focus on the tax front resembles a report card, highlighting the maturity achieved by our tax system. The enhancement of taxpayer services was emphasized as a key priority.","This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data and N for Nari utthan.

Interim Budget for a Viksit Bharat: It’s for everyone and all,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/interim-budget-for-a-viksit-bharat-its-for-everyone-and-all/articleshow/107497439.cms,"By Akhilesh Tuteja

The Finance Minister on February 01, 2024, delivered a truly innovative interim budget. At first glance, it did not seem like an interim budget but looked more like the budget to drive further growth and a continuum of inclusive growth-oriented investments.At the outset, this budget brings a wonderful balance between fiscal prudence and continued investment for growth. It's not easy to continue the glide path of reducing the fiscal deficit and continuing to make significant investments in all areas including infrastructure, R&D, energy transition, technology, skilling, and social welfare. The surprising reduction in fiscal deficit of 5.8% as against the budgeted 5.9% for FY24 and the projection of 5.1% in FY25 with a clear focus on increasing investments was a huge positive.This was a budget for everyone and all because it caters to every part of the Indian economy and society. The FM has carefully catered to the investment needs of various sectors. The continued focus on youth, impoverished, women and farmers to increase their involvement and contribution to economic growth is evident. By committing an 11.1% increase in capital expenditure to 11,11,111 lakh crore, the FM has clearly brought every single 1 in this growth journey.What was very impressive was the inclusion strategy of the government. The focus on women's empowerment for the past few years is unprecedented, which is reflected in the inclusion of women in the workforce moving from 23.3% to 37% in the last five years. The thirty crore Mudra Yojna loans to women entrepreneurs were a great boost to the Nari Shakti initiative. We already have over 10 million Lakhpati Didis and what is truly evident is like a corporate CFO, the FM has revised the earlier target of 20 million Lakhpati Didis to 30 million. The government also plans to invest in initiatives to encourage young girls between the ages of 9 and 14 to undertake the vaccination for cervical cancer which is again a great boost to Nari Shakti.A lot needs to be done to bring more women into all parts of economic growth but the journey so far and the vision of the future is truly inspiring.While India continues on its technological prowess and makes its mark in new technologies like Artificial Intelligence, we need a multi-pronged strategy to harness the power of AI. We need a clear focus on building AI systems in India so that we not only emerge as a global leader in this new era but can build models, which are specific to India that will benefit Indians. At the same time, we need a very wide coverage program to build skills to leverage AI to its fullest potential. The biggest contribution we can make to the inclusion of youth in the economic development of the country is by skilling them in new skill areas. In the last few years, the Skill India Mission has trained 14 million youth, reskilled over 5 million youth and established a staggering 3,000 new ITIs. The future of any country will depend as much on capital investments as on skill investments.The focus on agricultural development and support to the farmer continues through direct financial assistance to farmers. The farmers have benefited by getting crop insurance through PM Fasal Bima Yojana. It's not just the farmers, the PM-SVANidhi provides credit assistance to a large number of street vendors.The last few years have seen the journey of affordable housing through Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY). There is a slight increase in allocation to launch a scheme for encouraging the middle class to build or buy new homes. This investment will likely propel a wider economic development and increase employment.India has seen a tremendous rise in entrepreneurship in the last few years. In order to continue the journey and promote new startups, the government proposes to extend certain tax benefits, which are expiring from March 2024 to March 2025. The MSMEs have not been left behind. With a proposal to provide timely finances to such enterprises, the government has paved the way for their growth, so they can look to compete globally.All in all, it’s a truly inclusive budget with a clear focus on development not just by giving away freebies but enabling the people to participate in the economic development activity. While the FM calls the comprehensive GDP - Governance, Development & Performance – to me, this budget is inclusive of another GDP – gender, demography, and professions.","Akhilesh Tuteja is Partner and Head, Clients and Markets, KPMG in India.

‘Enough domestic sources of demand to counter drag from external sector’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/enough-domestic-sources-of-demand-to-counter-drag-from-external-sector/articleshow/107372012.cms,"Do you think the

creates room for lower interest rates?

One of the issues that the Budget has flagged is the demographic challenge and opportunity and the societal change that is taking place. How do you view this?

Niti Aayog is working on the Viksit Bharat roadmap. What will be the focus areas?

You are as much a representative of the Centre as well as the states. Is it time to revisit the entire formula for transfers to states particularly on the issue of cesses and surcharges?

Suman Bery , who heads Niti Aayog , the govt think tank, is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China, which he says is also an opportunity for India. The economist is confident that Indian states remain resilient. Excerpts of the interview with TOI.The finance ministry expects the economy to grow 7% next year.Given the global situation, how do you see the prospects?The belief in the finance ministry is that we have a possible drag coming from the external sector but that we have other sources. We have enough domestic sources of demand. One has to applaud the political and economic judgment of FM in deciding that it was appropriate to pursue the path of fiscal consolidation. There is transparency. What this actually reflects is responsible economic management, which is one reason we are where we are. Second, it also creates a buffer so that there is policy space if we do encounter headwinds.That’s the hope and expectation. We have an independent central bank and an inflation targeting central bank, so it is up to the monetary policy committee to take a call through the monetary policy committee on the repo rate .The PM has said that when India grows its states grow. India is a composite of 37 states and UTs. They are each at very different points in their demographic transition. There are some states where the net replacement rate is down to 1%, like Kerala . There are others, particularly UP and Bihar, which are in their earliest stage of demographic transition and each one of these states is the size of a large European country. There are two implications of that — one is internal labour mobility and it will become an even larger part of our growth model. The govt has taken several steps to create a unified market. Our main endowment is our human capital and that has to be equipped to participate in global exchange in many ways. We know from China, Japan that the demographic dividend partly depends on markets and on human capital. But the golden period is fairly short lived, about 15 years, when the so called dependency ratio declines. The other big opportunity the PM has been highlighting is bringing women much more into the active labour force.When Niti was set up there was the idea of a three-year vision and a seven-year strategy paper. The reality is that schemes of govt tend to be aligned with the award of the Finance Commission . There are various established building blocks or hand holds which are already a matter of govt policy. The PM is much more interested in a national debate on what it means to be a Viksit Bharat or modern society. We have a collective goal and it is for the democratic polity to define what that goal should be. Its emphatically not for a super mandarin bureaucracy. It is not going to be Lee Kwan Yew’s Singapore led from the top.It’s entirely a finance ministry matter but I would be lying if I didn’t say when I visit certain states there is this complaint. A big frontier would be resource mobilisation at the state level. Second is going to be rationalisation of subsidies not only at the Union level, but also at the state level. All chief ministers sit on my governing council. When they convene as the governing council, I see them in their role as development practitioners. The world is beginning to appreciate quite how much institutional and political maturity India attained in our 75 years and the most fundamental dimension of a democracy, we have orderly transfers of power. There are enough buffers to ensure that what happens in state finances is unlikely to create macro instability. Those risks are well contained by our Constitution. The chief ministers know that they are going to be judged by development outcomes and so you can have the sugar rush of changing of pension plans or various handouts but if the cupboard is bare you are not going to be able to deliver.","Suman Bery is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China.

Government's Marathon to 2047: Emphasis on Fiscal Prudence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/governments-marathon-to-2047-emphasis-on-fiscal-prudence/articleshow/107371788.cms,"What was the thinking behind keeping the vote on account absolutely straight?

So is it the idea to keep the Budget completely transparent?

The capex has risen 11.1% and there is an emphasis on infrastructure spending. But there is also the hope that the private sector will now take over and start capital spending. Given the geopolitical situation, how confident is the govt that it will pan out as planned?

Finance secretary T V Somanathan, in an interview with TOI, says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047 . Excerpts:If you see the Budget speech you will see the emphasis on 2047. The govt has set its sight on running that marathon.Running to 2047 is a marathon , it’s not a sprint. If you are going to run a marathon, you need to be in good shape and you can’t have short-term stimulants or something that will get you some yards and then it’s done.The whole focus is on making India a developed country by 2047, for which a healthy present and a strong fiscal position is an important concomitant. Some purely short term measures don’t really fit into that picture. It’s a consistent picture: focus on the long term for which you need to build strength in the short term and that needs to be done by prudence in fiscal policy and by not doing things which can detract you from that path. Not doing the wrong thing is more important than appearing to do things.The idea is that govt finances may be good, bad or indifferent depending on the times, depending on the circumstances, depending on the policies. But what is the position should be reflected as reasonably and accurately as possible. That is an emphasis. As regards the Finance Commission, again the terms of reference that have been given to them are the terms in the Constitution.What is the means by which the devolution should be done is a matter they have full discretion. They can actually take all kinds of factors into account and in a sense we felt this time based on my review of the previous commissions that the right expression would be less is more. The shorter, less prescriptive terms of reference gives full scope for all stakeholders including state govts to express their viewpoints and for the commission to take a balanced view of the different perspectives and then come to its award. Ultimately the award of the Finance Commission is about devolution and grant for which full scope has now been given to them.n There are incipient signs of private capital expenditure accelerating. There are some surveys I have seen done by some of the chambers industry, which show high levels of investment. The PMI, which is a sort of leading indicator, is also looking pretty healthy. Capacity utilisation is one reason that private sector capital expenditure doesn’t immediately pick up when the economy starts accelerating because there is surplus capacity.But increasingly I get the sense that many industries are beginning to reach levels where they have to add capacity. When that happens capital investment will happen. Another pointer also mentioned in the Budget speech you may notice that our airlines have placed large orders for planes — that is capital expenditure.When you import 1,000 aircraft, it’s just not 1,000 aircraft, there are concomitant additions to ground handling facilities, you need airports to expand, you need to employ people to do that. That means a lot of jobs. The aircraft is capital but then look at the effect it is going to have on skilled jobs. So capital expenditure is happening. I am fairly confident that we will have decent capital expenditure in the year to come and that will become a new source of acceleration.",Finance secretary T V Somanathan says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047.

Income Tax Changes Budget 2024 : In the recent Budget 2024 speech, the Finance Minister kept the Section 80C tax deduction limit unchanged. The maximum limit for claiming tax benefits under Section 80C remains at Rs 1.5 lakh for the current fiscal year 2023-24 and will stay the same for individuals looking to save on taxes through Section 80C investments in the upcoming fiscal year 2024-25.Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions. Individuals can reduce their gross taxable income by up to Rs 1.5 lakh per financial year by engaging in these specific investments or expenditures.You can save on taxes through Section 80C by investing in things like Employees' Provident Fund (EPF), Public Provident Fund (PPF), Equity Linked Saving Scheme (ELSS) mutual funds, National Savings Certificate (NSC), and 5-year tax-saving fixed deposits with banks or post offices. Additionally, paying life insurance policy premiums also qualifies for tax benefits under Section 80C.It is important to note that each eligible investment comes with its specific maximum limit, rate of return, liquidity, and taxation rules for the earned returns, states ET in a report. For instance, the most you can invest in PPF in a financial year is Rs 1.5 lakh. Meanwhile, there's no limit on the amount you can invest in ELSS mutual funds, but the Section 80C deduction is capped at Rs 1.5 lakh.If individuals can't make specific investments, they can still get deductions under Section 80C from their gross taxable income through certain expenses. These expenses include repaying the principal amount of a home loan, tuition fees for children, payment of stamp duty, registration fees, and other costs related to buying a house.Since the financial year 2020-21, individuals without any business income must annually choose between the old and new tax regimes. As of the fiscal year 2023-24, the new tax regime is the default option. Consequently, individuals seeking tax deductions under Section 80C must opt for the old tax regime since this deduction isn't available in the new tax regime. It's crucial for taxpayers to be aware of these rules to make informed decisions about their tax planning and investment strategies.","Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget which is an interim budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year. The budget talks about inclusive development both, social and geographical, especially for youth, women, farmers, and the poor. Continued focus on improving logistics through infrastructure spend on roads, rail, airports, ports increases productivity for companies and citizens alike.To make ‘Viksit Bharat’ by 2047, the government’s focus is on improving and empowering people’s capabilities through various skilling initiatives. It is encouraging to see that Skill India Mission has succeeded in training more than 1.4 crore youth and upskilling and reskilling 54 lakh youth. I am particularly happy to see the continued focus on youth and women entrepreneurship and the announcement of a new fund which will give interest free 50 year loans for startups will provide a domestic fillip to startups supplementing venture capital we have traditionally relied on from abroad.PM Mudra Yojana has sanctioned 43 crore loans aggregating to 22.5 lakh crore to youth entrepreneurs and thirty crore Mudra Yojana loans to women entrepreneurs. There are several other schemes like Fund of Funds, Start-Up India, and Start-Up Credit Guarantee schemes that are assisting our youth. Further, the extension of tax benefits to Start-ups and investments made by sovereign wealth funds/pension funds, till 31st March 2025 depicts the government’s effort to support the startup eco- system.This aligns quite well with India Sanitation Coalition’s efforts to give impetus to the start-up world. Over the past 7 editions of our ISC-FICCI Sanitation Awards, we have recognized and promoted several start-ups in the sanitation space, many of whom are successful businesses now!While the finance minister did not provide detailed information on Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH), the budget allocation sees a slight increase in spend demonstrating continued focus on this highly successful program. The acknowledgement that the private sector has increasingly played a substantial role in addressing WASH issues in both urban and rural areas, with numerous projects underway through Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs), highlights the government's commitment to addressing challenges in this sector.A perfect example is the LightHouse Initiative initiated by the Department of Drinking Water along with the India Sanitation Coalition (ISC) by partnering with major corporates across India to develop model villages in Solid and Liquid Waste Management (SLWM) under SBM-Grameen. From this budget, there is an expectation that the government will persist in prioritizing Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) as the path toward achieving the country's Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6). Additionally, it is hoped that the government will uphold its commitment to making necessary infrastructural investments for SLWM.The budget speech rightly celebrates the fact that we have 83 lakh SHGs and 9 crore women beneficiaries. The microfinance movement in the country and the possibility of empowering women members of SHGs through livelihood skilling is a key to bringing women into mainstream economic advancement.The focus on green growth, rooftop solar, wind, biomass, e-vehicles all help with our green energy thrust. The tourism sector was mentioned and could be a huge job provider for youth and women.Guided by the principle ‘Reform, Perform, and Transform’, the budget emphasizes efficient implementation of various policies by improving coordination with states and relevant stakeholders. This is critical both for infra spend and social programsIt is noteworthy that ISC’s Climate Resilient Coastal Cities project which is being implemented in PPP (Public-Private Partnership) mode in four coastal states of Karnataka, Gujarat, Goa and Maharashtra is congruent with the government’s priority of promoting climate-resilient activities for the blue economy 2.0, a scheme for restoration and adaptation measures, and coastal aquaculture.The budget also focuses on the Aspirational districts program where assistance will be given to the states for faster development of aspirational districts and blocks, including the generation of ample economic opportunities. This is again very crucial as it has a huge potential to transform the landscape of our country while making sure no -one is left behind.Overall, this budget has embraced economic strategies and develops the building blocks that nurture and uphold growth, promote inclusive and sustainable development, and enhance productivity.","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year.

HOW GREEN IS TN’S HYDROGEN?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/how-green-is-tns-hydrogen/articleshow/110444525.cms,"Green hydrogen is powering the latest competition among Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Gujarat and Odisha. Tamil Nadu has a green hydrogen policy and four MoUs totalling an investment pledge of more than `140,000 crore, all in Tuticorin. But how ready is the state with infrastructure to ensure projects go on stream quickly?“Our target is to produce the first molecule of green hydrogen by 2026-27,” says industries minister T R B Rajaa. “The state is equally invested in advancing R&D and nurturing an ecosystem for green hydrogen, especially in south Tamil Nadu,” he adds. The plan is to position Tamil Nadu as a hub, contributing at least 40%-50% of India’s target of producing 5 million tonnes of green hydrogen a year by 2030, says Rajaa.Each of the projects will require up to 10,000 acres, and attendant infrastructure. Getting the right land parcels is critical. “Grounding of these GIM projects is more important than rushing after new investments,” says Guidance Tamil Nadu CEO Vishnu Venugopalan. And since most of the green hydrogen is for export, investors are looking at land banks close to Tuticorin port. The port plans to auction land parcels of 50 acres to 100 acres within its premises shortly, say industry sources.The state is also working on complementary infrastructure, such as the creation of an electrolyser ecosystem of MSMEs, says the industries minister. The govt, he adds, is also establishing a 60 MLD desalination plant in Tuticorin district.Each of these initiatives is critical to operationalising the investments. “In green hydrogen, the operational challenge is two-fold,” says Venugopalan. “Adequate solar or wind power and an electrolyte plant close to the port.” TN has “first mover advantage” in green energy, particularly wind power but legacy can cut both ways. “Since the state was ahead of the curve in terms of wind power, most turbines are shorter and low megawatt capacity. So repowering of windmills is important,” says Venugopalan. Typically, the average capacity for smaller turbines is 40 kw to 60 kw but now big projects are coming in too. India’s second largest wind turbine of 4.2 megawatt is being set up in Tirunelveli by Brazilian company Weg. Here too there is opportunity for the ancillary ecosystem. The state, says Venugopalan, is looking at wind turbine parts manufacturing as it already has expertise in this sector. Trichy is known for wind turbine manufacturing. The state govt is also working with IIT Madras on hydrogen fuel cell technology, he adds.Industry, for its part, is rooting for future-ready demand support. “Building a green hydrogen hub at a port is useful for tapping opportunities to export green hydrogen to South-East Asia or Japan, but securing long-term offtake contracts is important before building such a hub,” says Amrit Singh Deo, secretariat lead, India Hydrogen Alliance (IH2A). Tamil Nadu, he adds, should “offer offtake-linked demand-side incentives to industrial units in key sectors.” Industry, through IH2A, has been engaging with TIDCO and the Guidance TN team, he says, to explore development of shared infrastructure for storage and transport of green hydrogen and its derivatives to reduce costs.That’s critical given that the main hurdle to green hydrogen becoming more popular is the price tag. “Green hydrogen is around four times costlier than grey hydrogen at $4.5/kg. India is trying to bridge the gap with scale economics,” says Manish Dabkara, CMD, EKI Energy Services and president of Carbon Market Association of India. But the game will shift gears once the govt of India leverages Article 6.2 of the Paris Agreement, which allows countries to exchange emissions reductions through bilateral agreements. “Offering carbon credit to investors putting money on green hydrogen will make it economical. India needs to sign MoUs with Japan, South Korea and Singapore, both for offtake and carbon credit,” adds Dabkara.","Tamil Nadu has a green hydrogen policy and four MoUs totalling an investment pledge of more than `140,000 crore.

Our daily bread: This Dindigul brand has entered kitchens across the country,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/our-daily-bread-this-dindigul-brand-has-entered-kitchens-across-the-country/articleshow/110444561.cms,"Despite Tamil Nadu being the most industrialised state in India, investors tend to choose sites close to Chennai. But more than half a century ago, this man chose to establish a food unit in one of the most backward regions of the state.It all started in 1942 when K S Srinivasan Chettiar, who operated out of Kotwal Bazaar in then Madras, decided to procure wheat flour in bulk from Mumbai (then Bombay) and resell. He later established a 50-tonnes-per-day roller flour mill at Tondiarpet, Chennai in 1962 and started sourcing wheat from north India and ground it here. In the next 12 years, the unit tripled its capacity.The licence raj prevented further expansion in the city, since it was a ‘forward area’. Chettiar was asked to locate his new units to a ‘most backward area’. And he chose Dindigul, since the region had a railway stockyard. Wheat is mostly transported by rail from the north.“In 1975, when I was sent from Chennai to oversee construction, Dindigul didn’t even have a ‘dial phone’. We had to keep the receiver pressed to our ears and wait for the crackle at the other end. After five minutes or so, the operator from the exchange would connect us to the number we want to speak to,” says K S Kamalakannan, CMD, Naga Limited, a `2,000-crore food products company. “In 1976, Dindigul got a 99-phone exchange and we got fancy numbers – 33 and 77 for our office and residence.”The unit started with a 100-tonne per day capacity roller flour mill, which became operational in 1977. Today, the company churns out 1,000 tonnes per day (3 lakh tonnes per annum) of wheat flour. Its silo in Dindigul, the largest in India, supplies wheat flour to most of the leading biscuit manufacturers in the country.“Given our large capacity, we have to cater to the requirements of all leading players. And we cater to every specific requirement including specific flavours,” he says.Naga forayed into downstream products and entered direct consumer business by launching Naga sooji, atta and maida. It then entered the pasta market through Savorit and added vermicelli to its kitty. Recently, it launched ‘Kolo’ and ‘Khara Morra’ snack brands.Diversifying, the company has established a two lakh-tonne per annum plant to make detergents and soaps for a leading MNC under a contract manufacturing arrangement. “In job work business, we need volume to make ends meet,” says Kamalakannan.Then came its foray into the animal feed business under the ‘A1’ brand which now makes two lakh tonnes in Dindigul. “We have planned a two lakh-tonne capacity unit in Tuticorin. Most of the minerals used in making feed comes from Oman, so a port town helps reduce cost,” says Kamalakannan.He attributes the company’s success to its focus on quality. “We never compromise on quality. In the early 1980s, when our employees didn’t have a decent theatre to watch films, we built Dindigul’s first twin theatres, Naga and Lakshmi, in 1984,” he says. “As people these days prefer to watch movies from the comfort of their homes, we closed down the theatres last year.”","K S Srinivasan Chettiar established a food unit in one of the most backward regions of the state.

Given the global supply chain crunch that has caused a mismatch in demand and supply of planes amid resurgence in air travel, the Union aviation ministry took this step to come to the aid of air travellers. With almost curtains for GoAir revival after a key bidder pulled out, other airlines could retain its rights after getting govt nod.

“Temporary distribution (of Go slots and bilaterals) has been happening for sometime now,” said people in the know. Tata Group’s Air India and IndiGo are adding almost a plane every week to their fleet. AI Express and Akasa also plan to grow rapidly, despite being affected by Boeing’s issues with the B737 MAX — the plane these two airlines have ordered.

“All airport slots that GoAir had are gone. Their bilaterals were temporarily distributed mainly among Air India, Vistara and IndiGo. Akasa asked for Go’s Dubai flying rights (it has so far got the same for Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Qatar). Now that there is no bidder left for GoAir, airlines will ask the ministry whether the temporarily distributed slots and bilaterals of Go will be put in a general pool and then given as per airlines’ needs,” said officials of multiple airlines.

"Fliers are freaking out over safety after Boeing, Singapore air mishaps",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/fliers-are-freaking-out-over-safety-after-boeing-singapore-air-mishaps/articleshow/110385984.cms,"A spate of high-profile airline accidents this year have left a lasting impression on the public.There was the fiery Japan Airlines runway collision on January 2, followed days later by the Boeing Co door-plug blowout . From lost wheels to a turbulent Singapore Airlines flight this week, the headline-grabbing events have left the flying public to wonder whether it’s still safe to fly.The reality, statistics show, remains that getting on a Boeing or Airbus SE jetliner is still exponentially safer than the drive to the airport. Last year, there wasn’t a single fatality among the 37 million commercial airline flights.While 2024 won’t match that record, it’s been an average year in terms of airline safety. Yet public perception remains jittery. US web searches for “flight safety” hit the highest level in March since October 2014, according to Google Trends.That year a decade ago was a particularly bad one for aviation fatalities. The disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 in March was followed by the shooting down of the same carrier’s Flight 17 over Ukraine in July and an AirAsia crash in December.The accidents this year have caused far fewer fatalities than in early 2014 or in 2019, when the second of two Boeing 737 Max flights crashed in March, killing 157 people in Ethiopia.Five people aboard a Japan Coast Guard turboprop lost their lives in early January when the plane ventured onto the runway path of an incoming Airbus A350. While nobody died in the Jan. 5 structural failure of a 737 Max 9 operated by Alaska Air Group Inc., the accident dealt a serious blow to Boeing’s credibility and to passenger confidence.Since then, a series of more minor incidents, from a Delta Air Lines Inc Boeing 757 losing a nose wheel to a United Airlines Holdings Inc. 737 Max skidding off a runway in Houston, have received widespread media coverage.On the flight from London to Singapore this week, a 73-year-old British man died from a suspected heart attack after the plane encountered severe turbulence.“There is reason for the public to be concerned but I think the concern is elevated because of the real focus that some news stations have given,” said John Goglia, an aviation safety expert and former member of the National Transportation Safety Board. “The wheel falling off the aeroplane never would have gone anywhere; in some local newspapers it may have been a one-inch column.”Indeed, government statistics indicate the US is having a fairly normal year.In the US, there were 11 accidents and incidents on commercial passenger or cargo flights in the first quarter, according to the NTSB database. That’s slightly above an average of 9.7 in the decade from 2010 to 2019. Serious cases stood at four in the quarter, slightly above the pre-Covid average of 3.3. The figures are based on cases the NTSB investigates, which include all accidents and only some incidents, so the numbers can vary.Meanwhile, the Federal Aviation Administration reported progress in one problem area. The rate of serious runway incursions in the first quarter decreased by 59% from the same period in 2023, a historically high year for such events. The current rate for 2024 is below the annual average of 0.31 per 1 million aircraft operations over the last decade, according to data provided to Bloomberg.“Aviation is the safest way to travel and that’s because we never take anything for granted,” said the FAA, which is responsible for airline safety in the US. “We are always looking for risk and ways to mitigate it.”The extended spotlight on Boeing has brought significant attention to the planemaker, with some fliers filtering out its 737 Max jets. Yet many of the incidents have occurred with older planes, and are more likely to be traced back to an airline maintenance or operational issue than the original design or build quality.“In this environment, any operational event no matter how routine can get outsize attention,” Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun said at the company’s May 17 annual meeting.Many of the events which have worried fliers this year, from landing gear collapsing to pilots overshooting runways, are classified as incidents rather than the more serious “accident,” which the International Civil Aviation Organization defines as involving a person being fatally or seriously injured, the aircraft sustaining damage requiring repairs or the aircraft going missing.That doesn’t mean there aren’t improvements to be made, according to Loren Groff, the chief data scientist at the NTSB. He pointed to the work being done to improve staffing and training for air-traffic controllers after some recent errors and near-collisions on runways.“Overall, it’s amazing that the US aviation system, and most of the world in general, can do something so complex so successfully,” Groff said. “Would I be afraid of aviation in any way? No, absolutely not.”","A spate of high-profile airline accidents have left a lasting impression on the public. US web searches for “flight safety’ hit the highest level in March since October 2014.

That makes positives including demand for the South Korean firm’s AI-related chipmaking equipment and buying of the stock by its billionaire chief executive look more than fully priced in.Foreign investors have started to pare holdings after pouring money into the shares last year. Foreign ownership of Hanmi Semi declined to 13.2% as of Wednesday from 16.5% in mid-February.“People who bought out of ignorance have left, and now some investors are having second thoughts,” said Yoon Joonwon, a fund manager at DS Asset Management Co. Foreigners may still be attracted to the potential but are less certain now, while local funds “seem to be holding despite doubts.”The stock has more than doubled this year alone, making it the top performer on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index , largely on excitement over the company’s thermal compression bonders. It supplies these to SK Hynix Inc. for use in making high-bandwidth memory for the likes of Nvidia Corp. Hanmi also recently won an order from Micron Technology Inc.CEO Kwak Dong Shin has amassed a stake of nearly 36% in the company, worth $3.7 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. His continual share purchases over the past year as well as expectations that Hanmi Semi will be added to the blue-chip Kospi 200 Index in the June review have been two additional positive catalysts for the stock.“It’s very unique that the CEO keeps buying shares,” said Ahn Hyunsang, chief executive officer at Korea Investment Research Institute. “The stock is very expensive based on the price-to-earnings ratio, so I’m not sure if there are any more legs to this rally.”Hanmi Semiconductor is trading at around 80 times estimate earnings for the next year, more than all other stocks in the 40-member FactSet Asia Semiconductor Index.According to DS Asset’s Yoon, the company would need to make 1 trillion won ($730 billion) in annual net income to justify its current valuation.

SEC opens the door for spot ether ETFs in big crypto victory,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/sec-opens-the-door-for-spot-ether-etfs-in-big-crypto-victory/articleshow/110378077.cms,"Significant victory

Crypto crackdown

The Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday paved the way for trading in exchange-traded funds that invest directly in the cryptocurrency Ether , putting the digital-asset industry on the cusp of a significant milestone.In a first-of-its-kind blessing, the SEC signed off on a proposal by venues run by Cboe Global Markets Inc., Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange to list products tied to the world’s second-biggest cryptocurrency. The move, which had seemed unlikely as recently as last week, removes a key hurdle for spot Ether ETF trading in the US. Issuers now need a separate sign-off from the regulator; no deadline has been set for that decision.Investment companies, including VanEck, ARK Investment Management, BlackRock Inc., and Fidelity Investments, are all vying for crucial first-mover advantage in the race to launch a spot Ether ETF. Their interest has been piqued by billions of dollars gushing into new Bitcoin ETFs since January when the SEC signed off on trading in those products.Shares of Coinbase gained as much as 4.1% in after-hours trading Thursday, while Robinhood shares rose nearly 3%. The crypto market response to the news was relatively muted - Ether traded around $3819.80 in the immediate aftermath of the releaseBeyond ETFs, the SEC’s announcement on Thursday is laced with US financial policy implications.SEC Chair Gary Gensler has been ambiguous on his views over whether Ether is a security, stoking concerns that the agency was hardening its stance. Crypto enthusiasts say they are worried about him trying to subject Ether — and potentially projects based on the Ethereum blockchain — to the agency’s tough, expensive and onerous investor-protection rules.Meanwhile, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the US’s other main market regulator with jurisdiction over derivatives, has signaled that it doesn’t consider Ether to be a security. The CFTC has for years allowed trading in Ether futures by CME Group Inc.As recently as last week, companies were banking the SEC would reject the Cboe plan — and potentially others — by Thursday’s deadline. Additional SEC approval is still needed for the issuers, but the signoff is a significant victory for the industry.Backers hope a listing will bring a new flood of money to the asset class by appealing to retail and institutional investors, who are interested in crypto but more comfortable investing in ETFs than tokens.Overall, investors, many who retreated after FTX exchange’s collapse, have already been piling back into crypto. Ether, the native token of the Ethereum blockchain, is up more than 60% this year alone thanks to the frenzy.Some of that rally is due to optimism that the US crackdown on the industry may be waning. The Republican-led House on Wednesday advanced sweeping cryptocurrency legislation despite opposition from the White House and Gensler. Although the Senate isn’t expected to approve the measure, it garnered some Democratic support in the House.On the jurisdictional question, Lee Reiners, policy director of the Duke Financial Economics Center at Duke University, said that exchange bids to list the products were based on Ether being a commodity and not a security. An SEC decision to green light the plan bolsters the view that the SEC still considers Ether not to be a security, he said.Investment companies seeking to list the products have already been making concessions to win SEC approval.Fidelity Investments said it will keep Ether it buys as part of the ETF out of programs that pay rewards for blockchain maintenance, known as staking. The latter has been a hot-button issue for Ether because it raises questions about whether the token should be treated as a security. Last year, the SEC in a lawsuit accused Coinbase Global Inc. of breaking its rules by offering staking services.",The Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday paved the way for trading in exchange-traded funds that invest directly in the cryptocurrency Ether.
