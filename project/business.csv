'War ties': Norway fund to sell Adani Ports stake,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/war-ties-norway-fund-to-sell-adani-ports-stake/articleshow/110187393.cms,"MUMBAI: Norges Bank , Norway's central bank, has decided to exclude Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone from its government pension fund over ethical concerns. This means the $1.7-trillion fund - the world's largest sovereign wealth fund by assets under management - will sell its remaining stake in Adani Ports.The Norwegian pension fund invests in equities and bonds across most countries and markets.In a statement, Norges Bank said it has decided to exclude Adani Ports due to ""unacceptable risk that the company contributes to serious violations of individuals' rights in situations of war or conflict"". The port operator, part of billionaire Gautam Adani's conglomerate, has been under its watch list since March 2022 and that ""observation now ends given the exclusion decision"".Adani Ports didn't respond to TOI's requests for comments on its exclusion from the Norwegian pension fund's portfolio. Norges Bank said its decision to exclude Adani Ports from the fund's portfolio was based on recommendations from Council On Ethics . COE is an independent body that makes recommendations to Norges Bank to either exclude companies from the pension fund or place them under observation. In a statement, the COE said that Adani Ports was under observation ""due to its business association with the armed forces in Myanmar "", which in Feb 2021 staged a military coup.The Indian company was involved with a port terminal in Myanmar, incurring an investment of $150 million. In May 2023, the company disclosed that it sold the Myanmar port to Solar Energy. The COE noted that no information on the buyer is available, and Adani Ports has stated that it cannot share any such information on the grounds of confidentiality. Lack of information means that the COE cannot establish whether Adani Ports still has links to the enterprise concerned.""In a situation in which extremely serious norm violations are taking place, this constitutes an unacceptable risk that the government pension fund's investments in Adani Ports may breach its ethical guidelines"". Norges Bank didn't mention the quantum of stake the government pension fund holds in Adani Ports. The fund has been paring its exposure in Adani Ports over the last several quarters. In Feb 2023, it held 0.3% in Adani Ports. Besides Adani Ports, it held 0.14% in Adani Green and 0.17% in Adani Total Gas. ts latest holding in all the three Adani Group companies couldn't be ascertained.","Norges Bank, Norway's central bank, has decided to exclude Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone from its government pension fund over ethical concerns.

Government concerned over telcos' service quality,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/government-concerned-over-telcos-service-quality/articleshow/110255026.cms,"NEW DELHI: 5G may be touted as one of the fastest-growing mobile offerings in India, but poor quality of services has raised concerns within govt, which has now decided to tighten the quality norms to ensure reduction in call drops and better internet speed.""We are concerned on the issue of quality of services and are now looking at ways to strengthen the parameters that go into assessing mobile services quality,"" a top official with the telecom ministry told TOI.Govt wants to ""revisit parameters"" that are assigned towards service quality, amid complains that consumers are not getting the promised services, despite India leapfrogging into 5G, supposedly one of the world's most advanced mobile technology.As telecom ecosystem matures with abundant supply of spectrum and data adoption shooting up, quality of services continues to remain a nagging issue, often vitiating customer experience .There have been complaints by customers and consumer groups about deteriorating services, even as telcos such as Reliance Jio, Airtel and Vodafone Idea argue that current quality parameters are sufficient and should not be ""burdened"" by new norms.Trai has the mandate on quality of services and its new chairman Anil Kumar Lahoti has listed it among his priority areas. Expressing concerns over frequency of call drops and slow internet speeds, Lahoti has said that he wants ""stringent regulation"" and better implementation of standards to ensure better customer quality.Trai had last year issued a consultation paper for review of quality of services standards where it acknowledged serious issues on network quality. Currently, Trai measures quality of services on a quarterly basis, giving average reports spread over large licensed service areas (LSAs). This, officers feel, fails to factor in dark spots with poor network coverage as overall results are an average of network throughout LSA.Sources said as 4G and 5G networks provide much wider coverage across the country compared to 2G and 3G networks, the stringent performance benchmarks should be earmarked for them.Telecom companies, however, argue that excessive regulations might not work. Jio said that introducing ""overregulation and unnecessarily stringent benchmarks and financial disincentives"" will impact the ease of doing business principle. ""Furthermore, from our experience, we understand that the most complaints are about when the customer will get 5G and nearly none about the quality of experience on 5G. Evidently, there is no valid ground for making such massive changes in a regulation,"" Jio said in a representation to Trai.Airtel said there are sufficient number of drive tests to measure network performance, and more stringent norms may not be needed. It blamed ""other external factors"" behind poor network quality. Also, it blamed growing usage of OTTs for some consumer experience disturbances.","Govt wants to ""revisit parameters"" that are assigned towards service quality, amid complains that consumers are not getting the promised services.

The net profit of listed public and private sector banks rose 39% to Rs 3.1 lakh crore from Rs 2.2 lakh crore in FY23.While public sector banks generated a record Rs 1.4 lakh crore in net profit during the year - an increase of 34% over the year-ago period - private sector banks increased their net by 42% to nearly Rs 1.7 lakh crore compared to Rs 1.2 lakh crore a year ago.As a result, the earnings gap between the two sectors has widened.To put things in perspective, Rs 3 lakh crore is approximately the total quarterly profits of all listed companies in the first three quarters of the fiscal. In fact, banks' profits are much higher than those of IT services, which have been the most profitable group in recent years - listed IT services companies reported a net profit of nearly Rs 1.1 lakh crore for FY24.In the preceding years, public sector banks had narrowed their profit gap with private banks as they cleaned up their balance sheets and increased earnings. In fact, the net profit of public sector banks has more than quadrupled in the last three years.Public sector banks would have had a higher net profit in FY24 if not for a one-time provision that several banks had to make towards pensions. However, because the pension provisions were lower than expected, it lead to a gain in their shares. Some public sector banks like Bank of Baroda also took a hit due to provisions for their exposure to Go Air, although the loan is collateralised.On a consolidated basis, Reliance Industries still has the highest annual profit of Rs 79,020 crore.

The finance minister set the stage for a ""Viksit Bharat by 2047"", on the core principles of ‘Sabka Saath’, ‘Sabka Vikas’, ‘Sabka Vishwas’, with ‘Sabka Prayas’ being added as a new theme in the interim Budget.This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data i.e., farmer welfare and N for Nari utthan i.e., support for women entrepreneurs.These form the pillars of a comprehensive inclusive development. The Government's commitment to sustainable development under the strategy for Amrit Kaal includes achieving 'Net Zero' by 2070, rooftop solarization for one crore households and robust health initiatives.The Indian economy's resilience takes center stage amidst positive indicators of declining current account deficit as a percentage of GDP, falling unemployment rates, and a notable rise in digital transactions. These statistics affirm the robustness of the economy, showcasing a trajectory of growth and stability.The achievements in taxation reforms are nothing short of remarkable, with direct tax collections more than trebling in the last decade, the number of tax return filers increasing by 2.4 times, average processing time of tax returns plummeting from 93 days in FY 2013-14 to an impressive 10 days in FY 2023-24, resulting in issuance of quick refunds. These are the results of consistent progressive measures thus obviating the need for, and rightly avoiding, any last-minute populist measures.No change in existing tax rates, both for direct and indirect taxes, is a good indicator of stability and predictability for investors and taxpayers.A welcome move to waive outstanding tax demands that are minor, disputed, and unreconciled. This involves the withdrawal of outstanding direct tax demands up to Rs. 25,000 pertaining to the period up to FY 2009-10 and up to Rs.10,000 for FY 2010-11 to 2014-15.The Government's commitment to fostering a business-friendly environment is evident in its intent to extend specific tax benefits for start-ups, investments by sovereign wealth funds/ pension funds, and certain IFSC units. The extension has been made now until March 31, 2025. This might help in creating a conducive landscape for business.To align with the CBDT notification issued earlier, the provisions relating to tax collection at source concerning remittances under the Liberalized Remittance Scheme have now been formally incorporated in the Finance Bill, 2024, setting the rate at 20% for amounts exceeding Rs. 7 lakhs in a financial year.The Finance Bill, 2024 proposes an extension of the time limit for introducing the faceless scheme by the Central Government for transfer pricing proceedings, DRP Proceedings, and ITAT Proceedings, up to March 31, 2025.The interim Budget 2024 may not have proposed significant tax announcements, but it very well positioned the prelude to the full budget post the upcoming elections. Considering the potential impact on the population across the four pillars of GYAN, a sizable portion of India stands to be covered. The interim Budget’s focus on the tax front resembles a report card, highlighting the maturity achieved by our tax system. The enhancement of taxpayer services was emphasized as a key priority.","This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data and N for Nari utthan. These form the pillars of a comprehensive inclusive development. The Government's commitment to sustainable development under the strategy for Amrit Kaal includes achieving 'Net Zero' by 2070.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-107449351,imgsize-22516,width-400,resizemode-4/107449351.jpg"
Interim Budget for a Viksit Bharat: It’s for everyone and all,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/interim-budget-for-a-viksit-bharat-its-for-everyone-and-all/articleshow/107497439.cms,"By Akhilesh Tuteja

The Finance Minister on February 01, 2024, delivered a truly innovative interim budget. At first glance, it did not seem like an interim budget but looked more like the budget to drive further growth and a continuum of inclusive growth-oriented investments.At the outset, this budget brings a wonderful balance between fiscal prudence and continued investment for growth.It's not easy to continue the glide path of reducing the fiscal deficit and continuing to make significant investments in all areas including infrastructure, R&D, energy transition, technology, skilling, and social welfare. The surprising reduction in fiscal deficit of 5.8% as against the budgeted 5.9% for FY24 and the projection of 5.1% in FY25 with a clear focus on increasing investments was a huge positive.This was a budget for everyone and all because it caters to every part of the Indian economy and society. The FM has carefully catered to the investment needs of various sectors. The continued focus on youth, impoverished, women and farmers to increase their involvement and contribution to economic growth is evident. By committing an 11.1% increase in capital expenditure to 11,11,111 lakh crore, the FM has clearly brought every single 1 in this growth journey.What was very impressive was the inclusion strategy of the government. The focus on women's empowerment for the past few years is unprecedented, which is reflected in the inclusion of women in the workforce moving from 23.3% to 37% in the last five years. The thirty crore Mudra Yojna loans to women entrepreneurs were a great boost to the Nari Shakti initiative. We already have over 10 million Lakhpati Didis and what is truly evident is like a corporate CFO, the FM has revised the earlier target of 20 million Lakhpati Didis to 30 million. The government also plans to invest in initiatives to encourage young girls between the ages of 9 and 14 to undertake the vaccination for cervical cancer which is again a great boost to Nari Shakti.A lot needs to be done to bring more women into all parts of economic growth but the journey so far and the vision of the future is truly inspiring.While India continues on its technological prowess and makes its mark in new technologies like Artificial Intelligence, we need a multi-pronged strategy to harness the power of AI. We need a clear focus on building AI systems in India so that we not only emerge as a global leader in this new era but can build models, which are specific to India that will benefit Indians. At the same time, we need a very wide coverage program to build skills to leverage AI to its fullest potential. The biggest contribution we can make to the inclusion of youth in the economic development of the country is by skilling them in new skill areas. In the last few years, the Skill India Mission has trained 14 million youth, reskilled over 5 million youth and established a staggering 3,000 new ITIs. The future of any country will depend as much on capital investments as on skill investments.The focus on agricultural development and support to the farmer continues through direct financial assistance to farmers. The farmers have benefited by getting crop insurance through PM Fasal Bima Yojana. It's not just the farmers, the PM-SVANidhi provides credit assistance to a large number of street vendors.The last few years have seen the journey of affordable housing through Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY). There is a slight increase in allocation to launch a scheme for encouraging the middle class to build or buy new homes. This investment will likely propel a wider economic development and increase employment.India has seen a tremendous rise in entrepreneurship in the last few years. In order to continue the journey and promote new startups, the government proposes to extend certain tax benefits, which are expiring from March 2024 to March 2025. The MSMEs have not been left behind. With a proposal to provide timely finances to such enterprises, the government has paved the way for their growth, so they can look to compete globally.All in all, it’s a truly inclusive budget with a clear focus on development not just by giving away freebies but enabling the people to participate in the economic development activity. While the FM calls the comprehensive GDP - Governance, Development & Performance – to me, this budget is inclusive of another GDP – gender, demography, and professions.","Akhilesh Tuteja is Partner and Head, Clients and Markets, KPMG in India.

‘Enough domestic sources of demand to counter drag from external sector’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/enough-domestic-sources-of-demand-to-counter-drag-from-external-sector/articleshow/107372012.cms,"Do you think the

creates room for lower interest rates?

One of the issues that the Budget has flagged is the demographic challenge and opportunity and the societal change that is taking place. How do you view this?

Niti Aayog is working on the Viksit Bharat roadmap. What will be the focus areas?

You are as much a representative of the Centre as well as the states. Is it time to revisit the entire formula for transfers to states particularly on the issue of cesses and surcharges?

Suman Bery , who heads Niti Aayog , the govt think tank, is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China, which he says is also an opportunity for India. The economist is confident that Indian states remain resilient. Excerpts of the interview with TOI.The finance ministry expects the economy to grow 7% next year.Given the global situation, how do you see the prospects?The belief in the finance ministry is that we have a possible drag coming from the external sector but that we have other sources. We have enough domestic sources of demand. One has to applaud the political and economic judgment of FM in deciding that it was appropriate to pursue the path of fiscal consolidation. There is transparency. What this actually reflects is responsible economic management, which is one reason we are where we are. Second, it also creates a buffer so that there is policy space if we do encounter headwinds.That’s the hope and expectation. We have an independent central bank and an inflation targeting central bank, so it is up to the monetary policy committee to take a call through the monetary policy committee on the repo rate .The PM has said that when India grows its states grow. India is a composite of 37 states and UTs. They are each at very different points in their demographic transition. There are some states where the net replacement rate is down to 1%, like Kerala . There are others, particularly UP and Bihar, which are in their earliest stage of demographic transition and each one of these states is the size of a large European country. There are two implications of that — one is internal labour mobility and it will become an even larger part of our growth model. The govt has taken several steps to create a unified market. Our main endowment is our human capital and that has to be equipped to participate in global exchange in many ways. We know from China, Japan that the demographic dividend partly depends on markets and on human capital. But the golden period is fairly short lived, about 15 years, when the so called dependency ratio declines. The other big opportunity the PM has been highlighting is bringing women much more into the active labour force.When Niti was set up there was the idea of a three-year vision and a seven-year strategy paper. The reality is that schemes of govt tend to be aligned with the award of the Finance Commission . There are various established building blocks or hand holds which are already a matter of govt policy. The PM is much more interested in a national debate on what it means to be a Viksit Bharat or modern society. We have a collective goal and it is for the democratic polity to define what that goal should be. Its emphatically not for a super mandarin bureaucracy. It is not going to be Lee Kwan Yew’s Singapore led from the top.It’s entirely a finance ministry matter but I would be lying if I didn’t say when I visit certain states there is this complaint. A big frontier would be resource mobilisation at the state level. Second is going to be rationalisation of subsidies not only at the Union level, but also at the state level. All chief ministers sit on my governing council. When they convene as the governing council, I see them in their role as development practitioners. The world is beginning to appreciate quite how much institutional and political maturity India attained in our 75 years and the most fundamental dimension of a democracy, we have orderly transfers of power. There are enough buffers to ensure that what happens in state finances is unlikely to create macro instability. Those risks are well contained by our Constitution. The chief ministers know that they are going to be judged by development outcomes and so you can have the sugar rush of changing of pension plans or various handouts but if the cupboard is bare you are not going to be able to deliver.","Suman Bery is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China.

Government's Marathon to 2047: Emphasis on Fiscal Prudence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/governments-marathon-to-2047-emphasis-on-fiscal-prudence/articleshow/107371788.cms,"What was the thinking behind keeping the vote on account absolutely straight?

So is it the idea to keep the Budget completely transparent?

The capex has risen 11.1% and there is an emphasis on infrastructure spending. But there is also the hope that the private sector will now take over and start capital spending. Given the geopolitical situation, how confident is the govt that it will pan out as planned?

Finance secretary T V Somanathan, in an interview with TOI, says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047 . Excerpts:If you see the Budget speech you will see the emphasis on 2047. The govt has set its sight on running that marathon.Running to 2047 is a marathon , it’s not a sprint. If you are going to run a marathon, you need to be in good shape and you can’t have short-term stimulants or something that will get you some yards and then it’s done.The whole focus is on making India a developed country by 2047, for which a healthy present and a strong fiscal position is an important concomitant. Some purely short term measures don’t really fit into that picture. It’s a consistent picture: focus on the long term for which you need to build strength in the short term and that needs to be done by prudence in fiscal policy and by not doing things which can detract you from that path. Not doing the wrong thing is more important than appearing to do things.The idea is that govt finances may be good, bad or indifferent depending on the times, depending on the circumstances, depending on the policies. But what is the position should be reflected as reasonably and accurately as possible. That is an emphasis. As regards the Finance Commission, again the terms of reference that have been given to them are the terms in the Constitution.What is the means by which the devolution should be done is a matter they have full discretion. They can actually take all kinds of factors into account and in a sense we felt this time based on my review of the previous commissions that the right expression would be less is more. The shorter, less prescriptive terms of reference gives full scope for all stakeholders including state govts to express their viewpoints and for the commission to take a balanced view of the different perspectives and then come to its award. Ultimately the award of the Finance Commission is about devolution and grant for which full scope has now been given to them.n There are incipient signs of private capital expenditure accelerating. There are some surveys I have seen done by some of the chambers industry, which show high levels of investment. The PMI, which is a sort of leading indicator, is also looking pretty healthy. Capacity utilisation is one reason that private sector capital expenditure doesn’t immediately pick up when the economy starts accelerating because there is surplus capacity.But increasingly I get the sense that many industries are beginning to reach levels where they have to add capacity. When that happens capital investment will happen. Another pointer also mentioned in the Budget speech you may notice that our airlines have placed large orders for planes — that is capital expenditure.When you import 1,000 aircraft, it’s just not 1,000 aircraft, there are concomitant additions to ground handling facilities, you need airports to expand, you need to employ people to do that. That means a lot of jobs. The aircraft is capital but then look at the effect it is going to have on skilled jobs. So capital expenditure is happening. I am fairly confident that we will have decent capital expenditure in the year to come and that will become a new source of acceleration.",Finance secretary T V Somanathan says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047.

Income Tax Changes Budget 2024 : In the recent Budget 2024 speech, the Finance Minister kept the Section 80C tax deduction limit unchanged. The maximum limit for claiming tax benefits under Section 80C remains at Rs 1.5 lakh for the current fiscal year 2023-24 and will stay the same for individuals looking to save on taxes through Section 80C investments in the upcoming fiscal year 2024-25.Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions. Individuals can reduce their gross taxable income by up to Rs 1.5 lakh per financial year by engaging in these specific investments or expenditures.You can save on taxes through Section 80C by investing in things like Employees' Provident Fund (EPF), Public Provident Fund (PPF), Equity Linked Saving Scheme (ELSS) mutual funds, National Savings Certificate (NSC), and 5-year tax-saving fixed deposits with banks or post offices. Additionally, paying life insurance policy premiums also qualifies for tax benefits under Section 80C.It is important to note that each eligible investment comes with its specific maximum limit, rate of return, liquidity, and taxation rules for the earned returns, states ET in a report. For instance, the most you can invest in PPF in a financial year is Rs 1.5 lakh. Meanwhile, there's no limit on the amount you can invest in ELSS mutual funds, but the Section 80C deduction is capped at Rs 1.5 lakh.If individuals can't make specific investments, they can still get deductions under Section 80C from their gross taxable income through certain expenses. These expenses include repaying the principal amount of a home loan, tuition fees for children, payment of stamp duty, registration fees, and other costs related to buying a house.Since the financial year 2020-21, individuals without any business income must annually choose between the old and new tax regimes. As of the fiscal year 2023-24, the new tax regime is the default option. Consequently, individuals seeking tax deductions under Section 80C must opt for the old tax regime since this deduction isn't available in the new tax regime. It's crucial for taxpayers to be aware of these rules to make informed decisions about their tax planning and investment strategies.","Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget which is an interim budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year. The budget talks about inclusive development both, social and geographical, especially for youth, women, farmers, and the poor. Continued focus on improving logistics through infrastructure spend on roads, rail, airports, ports increases productivity for companies and citizens alike.To make ‘Viksit Bharat’ by 2047, the government’s focus is on improving and empowering people’s capabilities through various skilling initiatives. It is encouraging to see that Skill India Mission has succeeded in training more than 1.4 crore youth and upskilling and reskilling 54 lakh youth. I am particularly happy to see the continued focus on youth and women entrepreneurship and the announcement of a new fund which will give interest free 50 year loans for startups will provide a domestic fillip to startups supplementing venture capital we have traditionally relied on from abroad.PM Mudra Yojana has sanctioned 43 crore loans aggregating to 22.5 lakh crore to youth entrepreneurs and thirty crore Mudra Yojana loans to women entrepreneurs. There are several other schemes like Fund of Funds, Start-Up India, and Start-Up Credit Guarantee schemes that are assisting our youth. Further, the extension of tax benefits to Start-ups and investments made by sovereign wealth funds/pension funds, till 31st March 2025 depicts the government’s effort to support the startup eco- system.This aligns quite well with India Sanitation Coalition’s efforts to give impetus to the start-up world. Over the past 7 editions of our ISC-FICCI Sanitation Awards, we have recognized and promoted several start-ups in the sanitation space, many of whom are successful businesses now!While the finance minister did not provide detailed information on Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH), the budget allocation sees a slight increase in spend demonstrating continued focus on this highly successful program. The acknowledgement that the private sector has increasingly played a substantial role in addressing WASH issues in both urban and rural areas, with numerous projects underway through Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs), highlights the government's commitment to addressing challenges in this sector.A perfect example is the LightHouse Initiative initiated by the Department of Drinking Water along with the India Sanitation Coalition (ISC) by partnering with major corporates across India to develop model villages in Solid and Liquid Waste Management (SLWM) under SBM-Grameen. From this budget, there is an expectation that the government will persist in prioritizing Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) as the path toward achieving the country's Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6). Additionally, it is hoped that the government will uphold its commitment to making necessary infrastructural investments for SLWM.The budget speech rightly celebrates the fact that we have 83 lakh SHGs and 9 crore women beneficiaries. The microfinance movement in the country and the possibility of empowering women members of SHGs through livelihood skilling is a key to bringing women into mainstream economic advancement.The focus on green growth, rooftop solar, wind, biomass, e-vehicles all help with our green energy thrust. The tourism sector was mentioned and could be a huge job provider for youth and women.Guided by the principle ‘Reform, Perform, and Transform’, the budget emphasizes efficient implementation of various policies by improving coordination with states and relevant stakeholders. This is critical both for infra spend and social programsIt is noteworthy that ISC’s Climate Resilient Coastal Cities project which is being implemented in PPP (Public-Private Partnership) mode in four coastal states of Karnataka, Gujarat, Goa and Maharashtra is congruent with the government’s priority of promoting climate-resilient activities for the blue economy 2.0, a scheme for restoration and adaptation measures, and coastal aquaculture.The budget also focuses on the Aspirational districts program where assistance will be given to the states for faster development of aspirational districts and blocks, including the generation of ample economic opportunities. This is again very crucial as it has a huge potential to transform the landscape of our country while making sure no -one is left behind.Overall, this budget has embraced economic strategies and develops the building blocks that nurture and uphold growth, promote inclusive and sustainable development, and enhance productivity.","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year.

"Tower of Babel?

But Zoho is one of the few technology companies working on developing its own large language models (LLMs), suitable for Indian languages and enterprise customers.Independent development of Indic language-focused LLMs in the country will have a significant advantage, says Shailesh Davey, co-founder and VP of Zoho Corp and its enterprise IT arm ManageEngine. The company is also experimenting with a Sanskrit-based machine translation model for translation within Indian languages. It is an experimental project exploring newer ways for more precise translation between Indian languages.Currently, Zoho offers Gen AI applications by integrating with large players such as OpenAI, Anthropic and Google. The company also customises existing models for specific uses such as training in the legal domain. For this, it builds small and medium language models.“Large companies building foundational models don’t share the same values. These models are predominantly trained on European language families,” says Davey.The way LLMs process Indic text is not ideal and uses a lot of hardware capacity, which makes it slower and inefficient, he says. These models could still be used in Tamil or Hindi with more computational power or ‘brute force’ as he calls it. “But then it is costly. You’ll be paying a lot more money than what’s essential and end users have to incur higher costs.”Davey says training Indic-language focused models from scratch and having the know-how to help them is important in the long-run. The technology is in early stages of adoption. This means we can find newer mechanisms for tokenisation of Indian languages, he adds.Tokenisation is the process of breaking down the text into smaller pieces and these are fed into AI systems. At present, scripts of non-Latin alphabets are more complex for computers to process. These capabilities need to improve and training and inference costs must come down to open up the market, he says.Zoho’s own LLM with more training on Indian languages could be ready by the end of the year. But, says Davey, it’s not comparable with large tech corporations’ assistants. Unlike consumer AI models, a lot of commercial purposes don’t need bigger AI models and vast training data sets, he says. Zoho is relying on training data in Indian languages from AI for Bharat, a research lab at IIT Madras that puts out data in regional languages. It is also getting data from organizations such as EkStep.The govt, he says, should play a bigger role in creating a digital public infrastructure such as Unified Payments Interface for AI to create data sets and tools in domestic languages.Some of the widely spoken Indian languages could have focused models and adapt faster in AI adoption due to availability of training data and commercial demand. “But for other languages, the market is there, but the cost is high, so some of the (govt) efforts could bring down the cost and then the commercial companies could build on top of that,” says Davey.Once a specific model is developed, it could be extended for other Indian languages with additional training with minimal costs, adds Dave.",AI systems right now have relatively low accuracy and take longer to respond in Indian languages. Zoho is one of the few technology companies working on developing its own large language models (LLMs) Zoho’s own LLM with more training on Indian languages could be ready by the end of the year.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,imgsize-110164,width-400,resizemode-4/47529300.jpg"
‘Innovation has to make technological and economic sense’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/innovation-has-to-make-technological-and-economic-sense/articleshow/110253135.cms,"Electric mobility evangelist Ashok Jhunjhunwala, founder-president of IIT Madras Research Park, is considered by the electric vehicle industry as the man driving next-gen innovation in the sector. In an interview with TOI, he discusses the new technologies being incubated at the research park (and some outside) -- some feasible, some fundable and some just plain fanciful.Excerpts: A lot of the next-gen EV innovation globally is looking at alternative battery chemistry, moving away from lithium ion to other compounds. Are any of the research park startups focusing on this?Yes, there is a startup doing something along these lines, but it is only focusing on lithium variations. I know some companies out there are looking at sodium ion and other options, but these alternatives are not looking that good. Any alternative [to lithium ion] has to make economic as well as technological sense. A whole lot of different chemistry can be done with lithium itself and the startup I am talking about is working on one such alternative. Companies are also working on battery cells – on how to make them more efficient. Right now, their focus is how to enable the battery to charge quickly, in 15 to 20 minutes flat. Most batteries get spoiled when you charge fast, but this company is working on fast-charging batteries that still retain their life expectancy. Are any of the startups looking at replacing some of the precious elements used in the battery?They are looking at it but there is nothing that I can claim yet. Currently, focus is still on variations of the lithium ion battery. Some are looking at sodium ion too but that’s at a very R&D stage and will not be ready for production in the next three to five years. What about work on reducing the weight of the battery pack? Already aluminium and even plastics are being used alongside special sealants. Are any projects looking at that?Typically, EV battery pack consists of cells, busbars and packaging. [A busbar is a metallic strip inside the switchgear or panel boards for electric power distribution.] Now, the packaging can be anything and plastic or metal are options. For busbars, copper is currently used. But whether other busbars will conduct as much current is not yet clear. To reduce weight, metal can be replaced by plastic but there are issues of heat dissipation particularly in Indian conditions. There are no quick fixes and currently we are focusing on getting the EV up and working. Are any companies in the research park working on hydrogen concepts?There are companies in the research park (not necessarily incubated by IIT Madras) that are working on both electrolysers [electrolysers use electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen and are a critical technology to produce hydrogen] and fuel cells. But the economics of both are not very good. So, they are a work in progress. You have talked about retrofitment from diesel to electric, particularly for three-wheelers. Are you thinking of expanding that concept to two-wheelers?What we’re doing is taking old batteries and attempting to recondition them. We are looking at what the value proposition is for that. When we see enough of old batteries available, we can attempt that. Recycling of old batteries can be done and should be done. What that means is after the battery gets used up, we can extract the elements from it and reuse it to make new batteries. That recycling work is definitely going on. That is very critical and will get done in the next five to six years. Right now we are getting cell phone batteries we are looking at recycling. EV makers say that going forward software will be the differentiator. Are there some projects working on this segment?Well, the software provides and drives the features for the vehicle and there is a lot of work going on in that area. Internationally, there is a lot of work on autonomous vehicles too, but in India it is not clear which way autonomous vehicles will go. I know some companies are working on it -- not in the research park but outside – though fairly early stage.","Ashok Jhunjhunwala, founder-president of IIT Madras Research Park, is considered by the electric vehicle industry as the man driving next-gen innovation in the sector.

BET BIG ON FINTECH,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/bet-big-on-fintech/articleshow/110253109.cms,"Chennai has a long history of banking, insurance, non-banking finance and even chit funds. The Madras Bank, which was subsequently merged with SBI, was established in 1682. Madras Urban Cooperative Bank, India’s first cooperative bank, was established in 1906. The country’s first private mutual fund was launched in the city in 1993.The city is a competitive hub for technology and several IT majors have established themselves in the BFSI services sector.But when it comes to marrying finance and technology, Chennai lags behind Mumbai and even the emerging GIFT City in Gujarat.“Chennai offers a fantastic ecosystem for fintech. It is home to some pioneering banks and NBFCs and has always had a robust pool of technology talent in BFSI,” says Venkat Subramanyam, founder, Veda Corporate Advisors, a leading investment bank. “This fusion of finance and technology skills should ideally place Chennai at the forefront of fintech action. Hopefully, we will see more successes going forward,” he adds.As a first step, the state govt unveiled an exclusive FinTech Policy in Nov 2021. Its key objective is to develop infrastructure for attracting next generation fintech firms.“The financial services space is changing rapidly. Banks such as IDFC First Bank and JP Morgan increasingly see themselves as technology companies with a banking licence,” says Ramkumar Ramamoorthy, partner at Catalincs, a technology growth advisory firm. “Likewise, born-digital companies such as Google and Alibaba, also called techfin companies, are into financial services in a big way. The distinction between traditional financial services players, NBFCs, fintech and techfin companies will gradually blur and we will see increasing collaboration and cross-pollination,” he adds.“Recognizing this, TN’s fintech policy covers all categories of financial services companies that have technology as their underlying platform for business as well as those that are building the technology platform ecosystem,” says Ramamoorthy. “I expect not only fintech unicorns from Tamil Nadu such as Yubi (formerly CredAvenue) to multiply but also well-established financial services players -- ecosystem and platform builders such as M2P Fintech and Kaleidofin, infrastructure providers such as FSS, and incubators such as FinBlue -- to play a meaningful role in tech-enabled financial services,” he adds.In Jan last, TN launched FinTech City, a project spread over 56 acres, that will offer developed plots for financial institutions to establish base, with commercial and residential space. It will also have a FinTech Tower with 5.6 lakh sqft of developed space for fintech startups and BFSI companies.“State govt is slightly late with fintech focus. No one has marketed or spoken much about FinTech City. They could have identified and built smaller infrastructure instead of waiting for the larger project. If they wait for construction to complete, they will miss the bus,” says T R Suresh, General Partner, July Ventures, a venture capital fund.“Chennai has the technology and knowledge base for this sector and it is already the SaaS capital. But financial services are highly regularised. If institutions already in core functions join hands with companies focused on innovation, the products will be perfect in terms of compliance,” says Suresh.“It is not too late for developing anything, especially infrastructure. Unlike other states, FinTech City is coming up well within city limits and in line with the upcoming metro rail corridor,” says Sandeep Nanduri, managing director of state-owned Tidco, which is promoting the project. “We are developing it in two phases to offer infrastructure support to enable the growth of fintech companies. While the FinTech Tower is under construction, we are also offering developed plots on auction for financial institutions (FIs) to establish their own bases,” he says.Recently two plots were auctioned and two FIs successfully bid for them. Since the Model Code of Conduct is in force, formal agreements will be signed after the first week of June.","Chennai has a long history of banking, insurance, non-banking finance and even chit funds.

Why alarm bells over F&O trading by retail investors?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-alarm-bells-over-fo-trading-by-retail-investors/articleshow/110255086.cms,"What's F&O trading?

What are futures and options?

When you buy an airline ticket...

Why is govt concerned about F&O trading by retail investors?

How has F&O trading turnover grown in recent years?

Is increase in turnover the only concern?

FM Nirmala Sitharaman and CEA V Anantha Nageswaran recently flagged the growing risk of futures & options (F&O) trading for retail traders. Why are policymakers cautioning retail investors on F&O, also called derivatives trading ? Here is an explainer:Futures and options are two derivative instruments where a trader buys or sells a contract on an underlying asset at a pre-determined price.As the name suggests, derivatives are financial products that derive their value from other underlyings like stocks, bonds, commodities etc.Futures are derivative contracts that give the buyer the right to buy a specific asset on a specific date at a specific price from a seller, unless that contract is sold off to someone else or closed. On the other hand, an options contract gives the buyer the right to buy or sell a specific asset at a specific price on or before the last date of the contract (called date of expiry). In options contracts, the buyer has the right but not an obligation to buy or sell the specific asset. An options seller has the obligation to deliver the assets to the buyer but no right to deny selling that.A train or a flight ticket gives the passenger (the buyer) the right to travel on a specific date but no obligation to do the same. At the last moment, the passenger could cancel the ticket or abandon the travel plan. On the other hand, the railways or the airline (the seller) has an obligation to provide the passenger the service on the specific day and the time for which the ticket was bought. The seller has an obligation to provide the service but has no right to cancel the ticket unless under extreme circumstances. So we use options in our lives, but some options are not traded on an exchange.F&O trading is being used primarily as a speculative tool to make a quick buck in the stock market. But the reality is that most retail investors are losing money. In Jan 2023, Sebi came out with a study that showed 89% of the people in the F&O space were losing money. That means only one in 10 people made money. But F&O trading volumes are rising at a pace that surprises market veterans .According to NSE, between March 2020 (i.e. just before the pandemic started) and March 2024, its monthly derivatives turnover has grown 30 times: From Rs 247.5 lakh crore to Rs 7,218 lakh crore. On the BSE, from a turnover of about Rs 1 lakh crore in March 2020, the total turnover in the segment reached a high of Rs 1,519 lakh crore - a jump of over 1,500 times. Compared to turnover in the cash segment of the market, F&O turnover is hundreds of times more.No. The huge spurt in volumes has also brought in a large number of fake and fraud operators in the market. Using various social media platforms, they induce people into F&O trading by showing and promising very high and unreasonable profits. They often use pictures and videos of celebrities and top business leaders to induce investors to fall into their net. At times, they also use screenshots of huge profits (called fake profit & loss or P&L screenshots) to prove their expertise to attract retail investors to trade according to their recommendations.",Futures and options are two derivative instruments where a trader buys or sells a contract on an underlying asset at a pre-determined price.

China allocates billions of dollars to bailout its crisis-hit property sector,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/china-allocates-billions-of-dollars-to-bailout-its-crisis-hit-property-sector/articleshow/110251075.cms,"BEIJING: After prolonged dithering, China has finally announced steps to address the near collapse of its mammoth property sector by allocating billions of dollars to buy back unsold homes and repurchase idle lands to resurrect its bankrupt real estate sector, which once constituted the mainstay of its economic growth. The People's Bank of China has announced that it would establish a 300-billion-yuan (about USD 42.25 billion) relending facility for the government-subsidized housing project .Local state-owned enterprises are encouraged to use the funds to buy reasonably-priced commercial homes that have completed construction, Tao Ling, deputy governor of the People's Bank of China, told the media last week. Tao added that these homes will then be used to provide affordable housing.Also, as part of the government's increased financial efforts to support the property sector, commercial banks across the country issued a total of 963.6 billion yuan (about USD 137 billion) in real estate development loans followed by billions of yuan loans for individual housing loans in the first quarter of the year, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.The newly set up fund will help developers to have access to financing and to encourage the repurchase of ""idle"" land and the ""relending"" funds will enable local state-owned enterprises to buy unsold homes they can then offer as affordable housing, according to Chinese media reports.Besides being unusually large, China's property sector accounted for about a quarter of annual output of its economy and was highly connected to other parts of the Chinese economy.The household wealth in China is also highly concentrated in property. Just as systemically important financial institutions had to be rescued to prevent a financial meltdown 16 years ago, major property developers in China may also be too interconnected to fail, according to a report in the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post.The Chinese property sector crisis, regarded as the most serious setback for the country's massive economy, sparked the default of the biggest property market developer Evergrande Group in 2021.Evergrande has reported over USD 300 billion in liabilities. Earlier this year, a Hong Kong court ordered the liquidation of the company, sending ripples across China and the world.Soon the crisis spread like wildfire with other real estate developers like Kaisa Group, Country Garden, Fantasia Holdings and a host of others declaring bankruptcy following millions of unsold and partly developed residential high-rises all over the country.Analysts say it is unlikely that the decision of the Hong Kong court in January to liquidate Evergrande marks the end of China's property debt crisis.As the property crisis became a major drag on the world's second largest economy, pinning its GDP to around five per cent with persisting slowdown, China last week finally moved to stem the crisis.Besides the USD 42.25 billion fund, the government also announced measures to boost the property market, cutting minimum down payment ratios, setting up a relending facility for affordable housing and pledging to deliver unfinished homes.The measures included minimum down payment ratios for individuals' commercial housing mortgages will be lowered to 15 per cent for first-home purchases and 25 per cent for second-home purchases.""This is the lowest down payment requirement in history, which will be very helpful in boosting the property market,"" Yan Yuejin, research director at E-house China R&D Institute, told Xinhua.",China has finally announced steps to address the near collapse of its mammoth property sector.

Reddit surged by 10% following the announcement of a partnership with OpenAI, which will integrate Reddit’s content with ChatGPT and establish an advertising partnership. Wall Street's enthusiasm for artificial intelligence technology continues to grow, despite warnings of a potential bubble.Conversely, GameStop and AMC Entertainment saw significant declines, retracting some of their earlier gains from the week. GameStop plummeted by 19.7%, reducing its weekly gain to 27.2%, after forecasting a loss of up to $37 million for the three months ending May 4. The company also announced plans to potentially sell up to 45 million shares to raise capital.Global indices reached new heights earlier this week due to optimism about potential interest rate cuts in the U.S. and other regions, driven by lower inflation. However, European markets faced profit-taking on Friday.""One day stock markets are making record highs and banking on rate cuts, the next stocks are giving back gains and rate cut expectations are being pared back,"" commented XTB analyst Kathleen Brooks.In Asia, Shanghai's market gained 1%, and Hong Kong continued its upward trend. Chinese property developers' stocks surged after Beijing announced a reduction in the minimum down payment rate for first-time homebuyers and hinted at potential government purchases of commercial real estate.China's real estate sector, a significant portion of its GDP, has faced considerable strain since 2020 due to tighter credit regulations aimed at reducing developer debt. This has led to declining prices and consumer hesitation in property investments, exerting pressure on the Chinese government to devise effective support measures.Recent announcements included broad measures to support the sector, as detailed in a meeting attended by regulators, top banks, local governments, and property market representatives. Specifics on the number of houses to be purchased were not provided.State media reported that the central bank and the National Financial Regulatory Administration would cut the minimum down payment rate for first-time homebuyers to 15%, one of the lowest rates in China’s history. The rate for second-home purchases will be reduced to 25%.Pantheon Macro economist Duncan Wrigley reacted cautiously, stating, ""China's new property support measures are helpful, but no magic bullet. The new measures are a step in the right direction and should speed up the bottoming out of upper-tier city housing markets, but the policy funding amount announced so far is disappointing and will probably need to be increased.""This week’s market movements reflect a complex global financial environment where regional developments and investor sentiments interact dynamically, highlighting the delicate balance policymakers must maintain to sustain economic growth.(With inputs from agencies)","The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed above 40,000 points for the first time.

US makes arrests in North Korea-tied IT job scam,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-makes-arrests-in-north-korea-tied-it-job-scam/articleshow/110219782.cms,"WASHINGTON: US prosecutors on Thursday announced the arrests of an American woman and a Ukrainian man they say helped North Korea-linked IT workers posing as Americans to obtain remote-work jobs at hundreds of US companies .The US department of justice (DoJ) said the elaborate scheme, aimed at generating revenue for North Korea in contravention of international sanctions, involved the infiltration of more than 300 US firms, including Fortune 500 companies and banks, and the theft of the identities of more than 60 Americans.A DoJ statement said the overseas IT workers also attempted to gain employment and access to information at two US govt agencies. An earlier state department statement said the scheme had generated at least $6.8 million for North Korea. It said the North Koreans involved were linked to North Korea's munitions industry department, which oversees development of the country's ballistic missiles, weapons production, and research and development programmes.An indictment filed in federal court in Washington last week and unsealed on Thursday said charges had been filed against Christina Marie Chapman, 49, of Litchfield Park, Arizona; Ukrainian Oleksandr Didenko, 27, of Kyiv; and three other foreign nationals. A justice department statement said Chapman was arrested Wednesday, while Didenko was arrested on May 7 by Poland at the request of US, which is seeking his extradition.The head of the justice department's criminal division, Nicole Argentieri, said the alleged crimes ""benefited the North Korean govt, giving it a revenue stream and, in some instances, proprietary information stolen by the co-conspirators."" The charges ""should be a wakeup call for American companies and govt agencies that employ remote IT workers,"" she said in the statement.The DoJ said Didenko was accused of creating fake accounts at US IT job search platforms, selling them to overseas IT workers, some of whom he believed were North Korean. It said overseas IT workers using Didenko's services were also working with Chapman. Didenko's online domain, upworksell.com, was seized Thursday by the justice department, the statement said. The DoJ statement said the FBI executed search warrants for US-based ""laptop farms"" - residences that hosted multiple laptops for overseas IT workers. It said that through these farms, including one Chapman hosted from her home, US-based facilitators logged onto US firm computer networks and allowed the overseas IT workers to remotely access the laptops, using US IP addresses to make it appear they were in the US.North Korea is under UN sanctions aimed at cutting funding for its missile and nuclear weapons programmes and experts say it has sought to generate income illicitly.","US prosecutors say North Korea-linked IT workers posing as Americans to obtain remote-work jobs at hundreds of US companies.

L’Oreal SA heiress Francoise Bettencourt Meyers, Dell Technologies Inc founder Michael Dell and Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim all initially reached the threshold in the past five months and some have fluctuated around that level, crossing it multiple times.Bettencourt Meyers became the first woman to amass a 12-figure fortune in December after shares of the luxury cosmetics company posted their best year since 1998. Bettencourt Meyers, 70, ranks 14th on the index with a net worth of $101 billion.Dell, 59, also recently saw his wealth crest the $100 billion mark after demand for AI-related equipment boosted Dell Technologies’ share price to record highs. He’s now 11th on Bloomberg’s wealth index with a fortune of $113 billion.Other new joiners include Slim, 84, who ranks 13th with $106 billion. The richest person in Latin America added about $28 billion to his net worth in 2023 amid a boom in the Mexican peso that’s helped to boost the stock of companies in his business empire, which range from construction to operating restaurants and shops.There are also old names coming back to the club. Gautam Adani, 61, recently returned to the elite group after a short-seller attack caused him to lose more wealth than anyone in 2023. Shares of his flagship Adani Enterprises Ltd rose as global investors increasingly focus on India businesses.Leading the pack is LVMH founder and Chief Executive Officer Bernard Arnault, 75, with a net worth of $222 billion. He derives most of his wealth from his stake in the world’s largest luxury-good maker.Amazon.com Inc founder Jeff Bezos , 60, ranks second with a net worth of $208 billion, thanks to his ownership of the world’s largest online retailer. Tesla Inc CEO Elon Musk , 52, has a net worth of $187 billion and ranks the third on the index. His wealth, which has fallen by more than $40 billion this year, mainly consists of his stake in the world’s most valuable car maker.","The combined net worth for these people is up 13% this year to $2.2 trillion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

Warren Buffett's latest bet: Berkshire reveals $6.7 billion investment in insurance giant,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/warren-buffetts-latest-bet-berkshire-reveals-6-7-billion-investment-in-insurance-giant/articleshow/110175706.cms,"NEW DELHI: Legendary investor Warren Buffett ’s Berkshire Hathaway has unveiled a significant investment in the insurance giant Chubb , marking a major move that was kept confidential until now. The stake, amounting to nearly 26 million shares, was disclosed in a recent Securities and Exchange Commission filing, representing a value of approximately $6.7 billion.This investment in Chubb highlights Buffett's ongoing strategy of investing heavily in financial firms. Berkshire Hathaway, under Buffett's leadership, has historically favored the insurance sector, owning companies such as Geico, National Indemnity, and General Re.Berkshire owns many other companies — including BNSF railroad, a number of utilities and an assortment of manufacturing and retail companies — but insurers, like Geico and General Reinsurance, have always been at the core of the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate. So it makes sense that another insurer like Zurich-based Chubb might appeal to Buffett.CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert said in a note to investors that Chubb is now one of the 10 biggest holdings in Berkshire's portfolio. “We can’t speculate whether Berkshire would pursue an outright acquisition of CB, but we note their business mixes are highly complementary,"" Seifert wrote.Berkshire had previously requested ""confidential treatment"" from the SEC to keep the buildup of this position private. The disclosure of this substantial investment comes after Chubb recently made headlines for underwriting a nearly $92 million appeal bond for President Donald Trump in the defamation lawsuit filed by E Jean Carroll.Following the revelation of Berkshire's new stake, Chubb's stock experienced an 8% surge in after-hours trading, reflecting investor confidence boosted by Buffett’s involvement.This move is part of a broader trend where Berkshire Hathaway has been concentrating its investments in financial entities, including Ally Financial, American Express, and Bank of America, while reducing stakes in consumer products. Notably, Buffett’s firm scaled back its holdings in Apple and HP significantly in recent months.Berkshire sold off a little over 116 million Apple shares in the quarter — accounting for about 13% of its stake — to trim its biggest single investment. But it still holds nearly 790 million Apple shares, and Buffett told shareholders that he expected the iPhone maker to remain a long-term holding.The investment community closely watches Buffett's investment choices, often emulating his strategies, which underscores the significant market impact of his decisions.(With inputs from agencies)","Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway has unveiled a significant investment in the insurance giant Chubb.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"
E-commerce firm Udaan raises $340 million ahead of planned IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-firm-udaan-raises-340-million-ahead-of-planned-ipo/articleshow/105991030.cms,"Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.","Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain.
