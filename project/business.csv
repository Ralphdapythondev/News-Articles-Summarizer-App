"Asked to quit, Paytm employees cry foul",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/asked-to-quit-paytm-employees-cry-foul/articleshow/110979880.cms,"MUMBAI: ""I started crying at the meeting. I told them that I was willing to work even at a lower salary and designation,"" said a Paytm employee who is staring at an imminent job cut . Executives from the HR department reached out to him over a call late last month, stating that his role would be eliminated as part of an organisational restructuring and asking him to tender his resignation by early June.Facing an uncertain future in the wake of RBI's decision to put an end to Paytm Payments Bank and the wallet business, scores of employees are being asked to ""voluntarily resign"" without being given any prior notice, several have been denied severance pay and many are being asked to pay back their joining and retention bonuses to the company, several former and present employees of Paytm told TOI.The fintech has not furnished any formal communication outlining the restructuring process and the resultant job losses to any of the impacted employees and has warned them against recording any of the HR meetings. ""The calls with HRs are being labelled as 'connect' or 'discussion'. There is no formal documentation of any kind,"" an employee alleged.A review of a few of Paytm's offer letters showed that the amount of joining and retention bonuses will be ""recoverable"" by the company if they ""leave the employment"" before 18 months of taking up the role. In some cases, the same clause applies in cases of termination ""for any cause"" as well.For those whose offers letters do not include the termination clause, Paytm's justification is that it is mentioned in their appointment letters which were provided after joining. Employees said that many of them did not receive any appointment letters either via mails or postal deliveries and those who did were never asked to sign the papers and acknowledge.Some of the employees TOI spoke with alleged that their offer letters do not mention pay back of bonuses in case of termination.Paytm has refuted the allegations. ""We strongly deny allegations pertaining to any forced action on employees or unfair treatment. We have rigorously ensured that our HR teams have informed employees about their termination through official channels only. Further, we would also emphasise that all transitions are duly undertaken as per norms laid out in the appointment letter of these employees. To help them adjust and plan their next move, we are honouring full notice periods of these employees while also extending additional support such as outplacement, and processing of due bonuses at the time of their full and final settlements. Our focus remains on building a leaner organisation that is well-positioned to deliver long-term sustainable growth and value to our stakeholders. We remain committed to supporting our employees during this transition,"" a company spokesperson said in response to queries from TOI.A former employee whose services were recently terminated by the company because he refused to resign said Paytm did not furnish an experience letter.While several employees voluntarily resigned over the past few months, fearing the repercussions of being served with a termination notice, a section of employees are waging a silent battle - they have refused to resign, raised concerns with Paytm's internal employee escalation team and are seeking a ""fair exit process"".The impacted employees have also formed a social media group to deliberate and decide on the next course of action. Some of them are consulting lawyers with at least one employee having already filed a complaint with the labour ministry.If an employee raises a complaint with Paytm's employee escalation team, the company is supposed to investigate the matter and present a report to the employee. An affected employee with the lending team is still awaiting a report to the complaint raised.""Just two months ago, (founder) Vijay Shekhar Sharma in a townhall had said that no one from the lending team will be laid off. I thought my job was safe,"" the person said.Some employees said that layoffs have been happening since Oct ""I was abruptly laid off on Jan 5. My finances were strained and I had to take a loan to pay back my bonus of Rs 2 lakh,"" alleged former staffer Prakher Srivastava.","Employees say they have been asked to ""voluntarily resign"" without being given any prior notice. Many have been denied severance pay and many are being asked to pay back their joining and retention bonuses to the company, several former and present employees of Paytm told TOI. The fintech has not furnished any formal communication outlining the restructuring process.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110984169,imgsize-1139604,width-400,resizemode-4/110984169.jpg"

"Adani buys Penna Cement from Reddys in Rs 10,000 crore deal",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/adani-buys-penna-cement-from-reddys-in-rs-10000-crore-deal/articleshow/110979861.cms,"MUMBAI: The Gautam Adani family owned Ambuja Cements is buying Penna Cement Industries in a deal valued at Rs 10,442 crore including debt, expanding its presence in the south. The transaction marks Ambuja's fourth M&A after Adani checked into the sector through the former in Sept 2022.Hyderabad-based Penna, promoted by P Prathap Reddy and family, has an annual production capacity of 14 million tons (of which 4 million tons is under construction). It also has limestone reserves and captive power plants.The Penna acquisition, to be financed by internal accruals, will improve Ambuja's share by 8% in south India and comes months after market leader UltraTech Cement ramped up its play in the region by buying Kesoram Industries' building materials units. As of April end, Ambuja had cash of Rs 24,338 crore on its books, having received warrant money of Rs 8,339 crore from the Adani family.The Penna transaction will help Ambuja and its arms, including ACC and Sanghi Industries, beef up capacity to 89 million tons, moving towards its larger goal of 140 million tons by 2028. UltraTech, owned by Kumar Mangalam Birla, has a capacity of over 150 million tons. In April, India's third-largest player Shree Cement, led by Hari Mohan Bangur, inaugurated a 3-million-ton plant in Andhra Pradesh to bolster its capacity to 56 million tons.Ambuja previously acquired Gujarat-based Sanghi, My Home's cement unit in Tamil Nadu and Asian Concretes and Cements' plants in Himachal Pradesh and Punjab.Prathap Reddy had earlier looked at an IPO for his cement business but subsequently changed plans. In Oct 2021, Penna received markets regulator Sebi's nod for a Rs 1,550-crore IPO but did not proceed with it. ""Initially we thought (of an IPO) but it got delayed. I have decided to do (away) with (the cement business),"" Reddy told TOI.The businessman, known as 'Penna' Reddy in Hyderabad circles, was considered a confidant of former Andhra Pradesh CM YS Jagan Mohan Reddy's father YS Rajasekhara Reddy, the unified Andhra Pradesh CM who died in a chopper crash in Sept 2009. Reddy was made an accused in the Penna chargesheet in the Jagan disproportionate assets case that is being probed by CBI and ED. Jagan's YSR Congress Party lost the recent Andhra assembly polls to Nara Chandrababu Naidu-led Telugu Desam Party.Incorporated in Oct 1991, Penna had a turnover of Rs 1,241 crore in FY24. In FY22, its turnover was Rs 3,204 crore. In May 2019, Penna had acquired Sri Lanka-based Singha Cement that operates a 0.5 mtpa cement packing terminal in Colombo.Penna's seven plants in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Rajasthan (under construction) and limestone reserves ""provide an opportunity to increase cement capacity through debottlenecking and additional investment"", said Ambuja Cements CEO Ajay Kapur . ""Importantly, the bulk cement terminals will prove to be a game-changer by giving access to the eastern and southern parts of peninsular India, apart from an entry to Sri Lanka, through the sea route,"" Kapur added.","Ambuja Cements is buying Penna Cement Industries in a deal valued at Rs 10,442 crore including debt.

"Market crash worse than the 2008 recession, warns Economist Harvey Dent",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/market-crash-worse-than-the-2008-recession-warns-economist-harvey-dent/articleshow/110947932.cms,"NEW DELHI: Financial author and economist predicted another "" crash of a lifetime ,"" which could be worse than the 2008 crash. In a recent interview with Fox News Digital, Dent warned that the ""everything"" bubble has not yet burst, and the resulting crash could be more severe than the Great Recession.Dent highlighted the unique nature of the current situation, stating, ""In 1925 to '29, it was a natural bubble. There was no stimulus behind that, artificial stimulus per se. So this is new. This has never happened."" He likened the government's response to attempting to cure a hangover by drinking more alcohol. Dent suggested that the long-term effects of continuously pumping money into the economy remain to be seen, but he expects a larger crash than the one experienced in 2008-2009 due to the prolonged duration of the current bubble.Despite the strong performance of US stocks in May, with the Nasdaq, S&P 500, and Dow Jones all posting gains, Dent predicts significant decline. ""I think we're going to see the S&P go down 86% from the top, and the Nasdaq 92%. A hero stock like Nvidia, as good as it is, and it is a great company, [goes] down 98%. Boy, this is over,"" said the economist.Dent has slightly adjusted the timing of his prediction, now expecting market bottoms to occur between early and mid-2025. He identifies the real estate market as the epicenter of the bubble, claiming that US homes have already increased in value by double or more than their future worth. Dent points to the widespread ownership of homes and the prevalence of speculative second and third home purchases as contributing factors.In response to critics who label his hypotheses as ""crazy"" or accuse him of fearmongering, Dent said ""I just say what I see and, frankly, don't give a damn if people don't like it, because you [have] got to choose: are you going to tell the truth, or are you going to make people happy?"" He rejects the ""perma-bear"" label, arguing that his predictions are based on historical analysis and the unprecedented power of central banks to create money out of thin air.Dent advises investors to seek safety in the most secure bonds, emphasizing the United States' position as the world's largest economy and its ability to endure the anticipated downturn. He expects the upcoming crash to be more severe than the one experienced in 2009, as the previous crash was mitigated by stimulus measures. Dent believes this crash will purge excess from the markets, allowing the millennial generation to benefit from a healthier boom in the future.","Financial author and economist predicted another "" crash of a lifetime,"" which could be worse than the 2008 crash.

"Bangladesh military unhappy with weapons imported from China; complains of ‘sub-standard’, faulty parts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/bangladesh-military-unhappy-with-weapons-imported-from-china-complains-of-sub-standard-faulty-parts/articleshow/110961484.cms,"Bangladesh, a long-time purchaser of Chinese military equipment , has lodged complaints with Beijing regarding the supply of defective components and technical issues with its imported military hardware . Bangladesh is not alone in facing problems with Chinese military hardware. Other countries, such as Myanmar, have also faced issues with Chinese fighter jets, according to an ET report.Experts on the Chinese defense industry argue that Beijing lacks the necessary expertise to produce highly sophisticated military hardware and is not yet considered a top-class manufacturer of modern defense equipment. They allege that most of the weapons sold by China are based on outdated technology that it had copied from the West.Developing countries frequently purchase Chinese weapons due to their lower cost compared to similar systems from the West. China sells arms through state-run export organizations like the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC), NORINCO, and CVIC.Sources familiar with the matter told ET, the Bangladesh military has recently accused Chinese companies of providing faulty spare parts for its corvettes, petrol crafts, and onshore patrol vehicles. These vessels were found to have manufacturing defects and technical problems.Also Read | India’s Defence Preparedness: From Agni-V MIRV missile test to 5th generation fighter aircraft, Su-30MKI upgrade & Tejas - top developments In a separate incident, the Bangladesh Air Force reported technical issues with Chinese-made F-7 fighter jets and short-range air defense systems. The air force also encountered problems with firing ammunition for its Chinese-made K-8W aircraft shortly after delivery.Sources indicated that Chinese-supplied airborne interception radars and radars on Bangladesh's fighter aircraft have failed to meet accuracy standards.The Bangladesh Army had purchased Main Battle Tanks (MBT 2000) from China's North Industries Corporation (NORINCO). However, NORINCO is reportedly facing difficulties in supplying parts to Bangladesh for the repair and maintenance of these tanks.The Bangladesh Navy has also faced challenges with two Chinese-made frigates (BNS Umar Farooq and BNS Abu Ubaidah) experiencing multiple defects soon after arriving at Mongla port in Bangladesh. The Chinese companies demanded additional payments to repair these boats.Also Read | Modi 3.0 must bite the bullet to make military future-ready A decade ago, China sold two refurbished Ming-class submarines to Bangladesh for just over $100 million each, but Dhaka later discovered that the submarines were obsolete.In September of last year, the Bangladesh Navy informed China Vanguard Industry Co. Ltd. (CVIC) of issues with the C704 system installed on warship 'BNS Nirmul', but the company only agreed to upgrade the system at an additional cost.Bangladesh had also purchased 45 Multi Launch Rocket System (MLRS) units from China but is now planning to replace 36 of them with Turkish-made MLRS.","Bangladesh has lodged complaints with Beijing regarding the supply of defective components and technical issues with its imported military hardware.

Snowflake’s taking AI to where data resides: CEO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/snowflakes-taking-ai-to-where-data-resides-ceo/articleshow/110955730.cms,"It has been about four years since Snowflake entered the Indian market. How has the journey been so far?

How has the rise of GenAI impacted cloud-based data storage and analytics service businesses?

You have just announced Snowflake Cortex Analyst and Cortex Search…

Where else do you see Gen AI having an impact?

You say that Snowflake LLM Arctic with its mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture allows AI models to be built faster and at a fraction of the cost of traditional methods. How does it do this?

How do you see the adoption of Gen AI-based products in enterprises?

SAN FRANCISCO: “We receive five billion queries on our Data Cloud every day,” says Sridhar Ramaswamy, CEO of Snowflake, the cloud-based data platform that provides data storage, processing, and analytics solutions. The number is significant, considering Google receives an average of 8.5 billion search requests every day. Ramaswamy was speaking at the firm’s ‘Snowflake Summit 2024’ in San Francisco earlier this week, where the company announced a slew of new technologies that “take AI to where data resides”. The company also announced a tie up with Nvidia that will allow Snowflake customers and partners to build AI-powered applications. Ramaswamy, an IIT Madras alumnus who was in Google for over 15 years and who was appointed CEO of Snowflake in Feb, spoke to TOI on the sidelines of the summit. Excerpts:Snowflake operates in two buckets in India. One is with India-based customers like Swiggy, Urban Company, and Piramal Capital, so they can unlock the full value of their data. The second pertains to the trend of American companies moving their core infrastructure to India. We are investing heavily in having a presence in India, in training more people on Snowflake. Companies like Morgan Stanley, for example, have their very senior staff in India taking care of data operations using Snowflake. We have close to 500 people in our Pune centre of excellence, and a lot more expansion is to come.Generative AI is going to have an impact from bottom to top in the stack. For example, there’s a Snowflake feature that transcribes videos, and after indexing the text, you can create a chatbot based on it. And the thing that people are most excited about is that instead of getting a bunch of links, you get answers. We also help them get grounded, cited answers, so that they know where the answers are coming from. Our value prop at Snowflake is to create a single unified product, where things like AI are tightly integrated, and we see ourselves as more an AI Data Cloud.Cortex Analyst is a bit of a North Star for the business analytics area — it will let a business user talk to their data and get answers back. If a business user asks an unreasonable question, the product will say ‘no’. As soon as you give people a chatbot, they start asking ridiculous things like ‘what is my revenue going to be 15 years from now’. A piece of SQL is certainly not going to give you that information. I generally see AI as an enhancer for data access and visualisation. Cortex Analyst is all about asking natural language questions of structured data. Cortex Search is about getting documents indexed so that you can create a chatbot very easily.In cleaning data, for instance. Data has always been messy. There’s no magic wand making sure that you have clean data. For example, think about all the documents that you have consumed. Whenever you search, for example, you are going to run into outdated documents. Making sure that these are marked as outdated or updated will be an ongoing event. We see language models helping with several of these problems. Companies currently spend millions of dollars every year just on data engineering – for cleaning up data, and getting it into a good place.Just like standard AI models, MoE is a stack of parameters, one on top of each other. There are often 24 to 32 layers of neurons that are different kinds of behaviour and connections. In dense models like GPT-3, when a new token (unit of input like a word, an image, etc) comes in for training, it ends up affecting every parameter (GPT-3 has approximately 175 billion parameters) at every layer. For instance, you take a sentence, mask a word in it, and ask the model to predict the word by feeding this sentence in. In the process, every token ends up affecting all parameters and this just makes it computationally expensive to update the model to train on a large amount of data. With MoE, you do an arbitrary subdivision of the token space and, during training, you will have portions of the neural network that get activated for different buckets of tokens (instead of having to impact all the parameters). So, you end up constructing models that are a combination of dense networks that are activated for every token, and sparse experts that are activated only partially. Now, this process can end up producing models that are almost as good as the dense models, but for a smaller amount of compute. And, you can train models faster and more efficiently.Canva, Zoom and Bayer and many others are harnessing Cortex AI to create applications and drive productivity. We have several hundred others building applications to talk to their enterprise data with natural language for business-critical decision making.","Sridhar Ramaswamy is CEO of Snowflake, a cloud-based data platform that provides data storage, processing, and analytics solutions.

"Expand base, avoid super rich tax: CII president",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/expand-base-avoid-super-rich-tax-cii-president/articleshow/111046418.cms,"How is a coalition govt at the Centre going to impact policymaking?

What are the stumbling blocks that you want govt to remove to accelerate

job creation

?

There has been a lot of debate around inequality and there have been suggestions about taxing the super rich to raise resources. What is your view?

How complex do you find GST in terms of number of slabs, classification issues? What changes would you want?

ITC chairman and managing director Sanjiv Puri took over as the new CII president during elections. The industry chamber is recommending several measures, including creating more jobs, skilling and generating political consensus on crucial reforms related to land & labour laws and farm & power sector. In an interview with TOI, Puri emphasised the need to widen the tax base , while rejecting higher levies on the super rich and backed a three-slab GST structure . Excerpts:A number of policy instruments have been used in the past, while following a model of inclusive growth within the fiscal glide path and dealing with energy transition. The outcome is before us, the economy grew 8.2% last year. The economy is in robust health, that's really shows the strategy of investment-led inclusive growth is directionally right, because it creates a virtuous cycle and enhances the productive capacity. That should energise more reforms. One of the first recommendations that CII has given is to create some institutional mechanism to develop consensus on some of the big reforms of land, labour, power, agriculture, fiscal sustainability because that also involves the states.Job creation is also a responsibility of the private sector, govt mainly has to put the enablers in place. Private capex is on the right trajectory. In FY22-23, it was at 23.8% of GDP, which is higher than what it was pre-Covid and had dropped to 20.7% of GDP in 2021. There are several sectors where investments are coming, sectors related to infrastructure, cement and steel, sectors which have received impetus PLI like electronics, food processing, telecom, pharma, logistics, renewable energy, automobiles, EVs, semiconductors. On the issue of jobs - it's about jobs and also the quality of jobs. For creating good quality of jobs, CII is recommending some policy enablers to provide impetus to labour-intensive sectors, like apparel, toys, retail, media, entertainment, logistics, tourism, wood-based industry. There are so many areas where the employment to capital ratio is very favourable. So, we're recommending employment-linked incentives for these sectors, with some outcome metrics.The second important thing is to provide impetus to MSMEs, which create a lot of employment and there is larger integration into global value chains. The journey has started because the world also is looking at supply chain diversification. So, free trade agreements provide some impetus to this. Human capital development and social infrastructure is important. We have recommended increasing the investment in education to 6% of GDP and for healthcare to 3%. What is also important is to create a vibrant rural economy. The first piece that has to be solved is agriculture, both from a productivity perspective plus also resilience because weather events are only going to multiply. The second is to empower the youth in rural areas to be able to participate in other opportunities in the economy.The most important facet is really about continuing to create the virtuous cycle of employment consumption, investment and creating good quality jobs. Improving farm incomes, that's the most important area to focus on. As far as specifically direct tax is concerned, it's more about getting more people within the tax system, and not resorting to, as some have suggested, taxing the so-called super rich, or (imposing) wealth tax and things like that. The focus right now has to be on creating an economy that creates a lot of jobs, that's ultimately where the solution is going to live. The second is expanding the (tax) base.We are recommending three slabs. In addition to that, we are also saying it should be more inclusive. Real estate, petroleum are outside, all these should be brought in. There is room for process simplification, which is an ongoing exercise.","ITC chairman and managing director Sanjiv Puri took over as the new CII president during elections.

Industry frets over new ad mandate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/industry-frets-over-new-ad-mandate/articleshow/111046410.cms,"New Delhi: Starting Tuesday, advertisers in India face a new mandate: A self-declaration certification (SDC), as directed by the Supreme Court. Conceptualised as a ""positive step for protecting consumers, fostering trust, transparency, and enhancing brand reputation "", the move aims to ensure that all stakeholders are more vigilant and compliant. Yet, opinion is divided among advertising bigwigs, media agencies, and marketing experts on the ease of its implementation and whether it will effectively curb the widespread issues of misleading claims and surrogate advertising .On May 7, in a case involving the Indian Medical Association and the Centre, SC directed that no advertisements on television, print, digital, or radio can be published or aired without the SDC, aiming to ensure compliance with regulations and prevent misleading claims.""The entire advertising ecosystem, be it advertisers, agencies or publishers will need to create internal systems to be compliant,"" Manisha Kapoor, CEO and secretary general, Advertising Standards Council of India, told TOI.This is true for all sectors and categories.""Practices such as advertising reviews, prior to publishing and preventive risk-assessments to avoid potential backlash will now be embedded in the brand strategy of an organisation. The threat of adverse impact that emerges from this regulation requires that organisations invest in verifying the claims of external communication,"" said Mustafa Surka - partner, risk advisory services at KPMG India.The pre-release approval by theregulatory agency works better for all the stakeholders and saves time, resources and effort rather than a post-correction, feels Nandini Dias, former CEO of Lodestar UM. ""Often after ad is released, someone objects and puts a stop to it. If the ad is pulled off, it disrupts the entire marketing activity for that quarter and causes huge loss to the brand. In the Doordarshan days, one had to submit the complete storyboard, frame-by-frame and get approvals, and only after that was the film shot. And once we had DD approval, no other objections were considered. Today, the scenario is far more dynamic and complicated, it is essential to create a new system. While there is resistance as it will slow the systems down in the short-run, it will be beneficial to consumers and will help transparency in the long-run,"" she added.""All consumer brands may associate themselves with a cause, but these claims may not be trustworthy. For instance, making claims like a product is green, net zero, plastic neutral, will all need to be verifiable. Building brand trust requires clarity, responsibility, and accurate advertising,"" said Namrata Rana - partner, national head (ESG), KPMG India.Advertising experts fear it may increase red tape, and companies and agencies will need manpower to navigate the cumbersome process.""This seems to be an exercise in bureaucracy rather than the law. Creating bureaucratic hurdles make things difficult for advertisers, without solving the problem of misleading ads,"" said Santosh Desai, advertising veteran and former CEO, Future Brands.More efforts may be needed. ""Prima facie (the move) has been conceptualised to protect consumer rights. However, it may not be able to curb the menace of surrogate advertising and misleading claims - the basic objective for which it was created. The entire implementation and thereafter - monitoring, policing and punishment require a lot of thought, and is not clear at this stage,"" said Sandeep Goyal, chairman, Rediffusion.In a representation to the I&B ministry, the Indian Newspaper Society too has flagged several concerns, including problems with the portal where self-declaration has to be made, and sought that the implementation may be deferred. It has suggested that the existing mechanisms should be strengthened and govt may consider limiting the mandate to healthcare related or medical ads.","Starting Tuesday, advertisers in India face a new mandate: A self-declaration certification (SDC) The Supreme Court directed that no advertisements on television, print, digital, or radio can be published or aired without the SDC.

The finance minister set the stage for a ""Viksit Bharat by 2047"", on the core principles of ‘Sabka Saath’, ‘Sabka Vikas’, ‘Sabka Vishwas’, with ‘Sabka Prayas’ being added as a new theme in the interim Budget.This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data i.e., farmer welfare and N for Nari utthan i.e., support for women entrepreneurs. These form the pillars of a comprehensive inclusive development. The Government's commitment to sustainable development under the strategy for Amrit Kaal includes achieving 'Net Zero' by 2070, rooftop solarization for one crore households and robust health initiatives.The Indian economy's resilience takes center stage amidst positive indicators of declining current account deficit as a percentage of GDP, falling unemployment rates, and a notable rise in digital transactions. These statistics affirm the robustness of the economy, showcasing a trajectory of growth and stability.The achievements in taxation reforms are nothing short of remarkable, with direct tax collections more than trebling in the last decade, the number of tax return filers increasing by 2.4 times, average processing time of tax returns plummeting from 93 days in FY 2013-14 to an impressive 10 days in FY 2023-24, resulting in issuance of quick refunds. These are the results of consistent progressive measures thus obviating the need for, and rightly avoiding, any last-minute populist measures.No change in existing tax rates, both for direct and indirect taxes, is a good indicator of stability and predictability for investors and taxpayers.A welcome move to waive outstanding tax demands that are minor, disputed, and unreconciled. This involves the withdrawal of outstanding direct tax demands up to Rs. 25,000 pertaining to the period up to FY 2009-10 and up to Rs.10,000 for FY 2010-11 to 2014-15.The Government's commitment to fostering a business-friendly environment is evident in its intent to extend specific tax benefits for start-ups, investments by sovereign wealth funds/ pension funds, and certain IFSC units. The extension has been made now until March 31, 2025. This might help in creating a conducive landscape for business.To align with the CBDT notification issued earlier, the provisions relating to tax collection at source concerning remittances under the Liberalized Remittance Scheme have now been formally incorporated in the Finance Bill, 2024, setting the rate at 20% for amounts exceeding Rs. 7 lakhs in a financial year.The Finance Bill, 2024 proposes an extension of the time limit for introducing the faceless scheme by the Central Government for transfer pricing proceedings, DRP Proceedings, and ITAT Proceedings, up to March 31, 2025.The interim Budget 2024 may not have proposed significant tax announcements, but it very well positioned the prelude to the full budget post the upcoming elections. Considering the potential impact on the population across the four pillars of GYAN, a sizable portion of India stands to be covered. The interim Budget’s focus on the tax front resembles a report card, highlighting the maturity achieved by our tax system. The enhancement of taxpayer services was emphasized as a key priority.","This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data and N for Nari utthan.

The Finance Minister on February 01, 2024, delivered a truly innovative interim budget. At first glance, it did not seem like an interim budget but looked more like the budget to drive further growth and a continuum of inclusive growth-oriented investments.At the outset, this budget brings a wonderful balance between fiscal prudence and continued investment for growth. It's not easy to continue the glide path of reducing the fiscal deficit and continuing to make significant investments in all areas including infrastructure, R&D, energy transition, technology, skilling, and social welfare. The surprising reduction in fiscal deficit of 5.8% as against the budgeted 5.9% for FY24 and the projection of 5.1% in FY25 with a clear focus on increasing investments was a huge positive.This was a budget for everyone and all because it caters to every part of the Indian economy and society. The FM has carefully catered to the investment needs of various sectors. The continued focus on youth, impoverished, women and farmers to increase their involvement and contribution to economic growth is evident. By committing an 11.1% increase in capital expenditure to 11,11,111 lakh crore, the FM has clearly brought every single 1 in this growth journey.What was very impressive was the inclusion strategy of the government. The focus on women's empowerment for the past few years is unprecedented, which is reflected in the inclusion of women in the workforce moving from 23.3% to 37% in the last five years. The thirty crore Mudra Yojna loans to women entrepreneurs were a great boost to the Nari Shakti initiative. We already have over 10 million Lakhpati Didis and what is truly evident is like a corporate CFO, the FM has revised the earlier target of 20 million Lakhpati Didis to 30 million. The government also plans to invest in initiatives to encourage young girls between the ages of 9 and 14 to undertake the vaccination for cervical cancer which is again a great boost to Nari Shakti.A lot needs to be done to bring more women into all parts of economic growth but the journey so far and the vision of the future is truly inspiring.While India continues on its technological prowess and makes its mark in new technologies like Artificial Intelligence, we need a multi-pronged strategy to harness the power of AI. We need a clear focus on building AI systems in India so that we not only emerge as a global leader in this new era but can build models, which are specific to India that will benefit Indians. At the same time, we need a very wide coverage program to build skills to leverage AI to its fullest potential. The biggest contribution we can make to the inclusion of youth in the economic development of the country is by skilling them in new skill areas. In the last few years, the Skill India Mission has trained 14 million youth, reskilled over 5 million youth and established a staggering 3,000 new ITIs. The future of any country will depend as much on capital investments as on skill investments.The focus on agricultural development and support to the farmer continues through direct financial assistance to farmers. The farmers have benefited by getting crop insurance through PM Fasal Bima Yojana. It's not just the farmers, the PM-SVANidhi provides credit assistance to a large number of street vendors.The last few years have seen the journey of affordable housing through Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY). There is a slight increase in allocation to launch a scheme for encouraging the middle class to build or buy new homes. This investment will likely propel a wider economic development and increase employment.India has seen a tremendous rise in entrepreneurship in the last few years. In order to continue the journey and promote new startups, the government proposes to extend certain tax benefits, which are expiring from March 2024 to March 2025. The MSMEs have not been left behind. With a proposal to provide timely finances to such enterprises, the government has paved the way for their growth, so they can look to compete globally.All in all, it’s a truly inclusive budget with a clear focus on development not just by giving away freebies but enabling the people to participate in the economic development activity. While the FM calls the comprehensive GDP - Governance, Development & Performance – to me, this budget is inclusive of another GDP – gender, demography, and professions.","Akhilesh Tuteja is Partner and Head, Clients and Markets, KPMG in India.

‘Enough domestic sources of demand to counter drag from external sector’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/enough-domestic-sources-of-demand-to-counter-drag-from-external-sector/articleshow/107372012.cms,"Do you think the

creates room for lower interest rates?

One of the issues that the Budget has flagged is the demographic challenge and opportunity and the societal change that is taking place. How do you view this?

Niti Aayog is working on the Viksit Bharat roadmap. What will be the focus areas?

You are as much a representative of the Centre as well as the states. Is it time to revisit the entire formula for transfers to states particularly on the issue of cesses and surcharges?

Suman Bery , who heads Niti Aayog , the govt think tank, is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China, which he says is also an opportunity for India. The economist is confident that Indian states remain resilient. Excerpts of the interview with TOI.The finance ministry expects the economy to grow 7% next year. Given the global situation, how do you see the prospects?The belief in the finance ministry is that we have a possible drag coming from the external sector but that we have other sources. We have enough domestic sources of demand. One has to applaud the political and economic judgment of FM in deciding that it was appropriate to pursue the path of fiscal consolidation. There is transparency. What this actually reflects is responsible economic management, which is one reason we are where we are. Second, it also creates a buffer so that there is policy space if we do encounter headwinds.That’s the hope and expectation. We have an independent central bank and an inflation targeting central bank, so it is up to the monetary policy committee to take a call through the monetary policy committee on the repo rate .The PM has said that when India grows its states grow. India is a composite of 37 states and UTs. They are each at very different points in their demographic transition. There are some states where the net replacement rate is down to 1%, like Kerala . There are others, particularly UP and Bihar, which are in their earliest stage of demographic transition and each one of these states is the size of a large European country. There are two implications of that — one is internal labour mobility and it will become an even larger part of our growth model. The govt has taken several steps to create a unified market. Our main endowment is our human capital and that has to be equipped to participate in global exchange in many ways. We know from China, Japan that the demographic dividend partly depends on markets and on human capital. But the golden period is fairly short lived, about 15 years, when the so called dependency ratio declines. The other big opportunity the PM has been highlighting is bringing women much more into the active labour force.When Niti was set up there was the idea of a three-year vision and a seven-year strategy paper. The reality is that schemes of govt tend to be aligned with the award of the Finance Commission . There are various established building blocks or hand holds which are already a matter of govt policy. The PM is much more interested in a national debate on what it means to be a Viksit Bharat or modern society. We have a collective goal and it is for the democratic polity to define what that goal should be. Its emphatically not for a super mandarin bureaucracy. It is not going to be Lee Kwan Yew’s Singapore led from the top.It’s entirely a finance ministry matter but I would be lying if I didn’t say when I visit certain states there is this complaint. A big frontier would be resource mobilisation at the state level. Second is going to be rationalisation of subsidies not only at the Union level, but also at the state level. All chief ministers sit on my governing council. When they convene as the governing council, I see them in their role as development practitioners. The world is beginning to appreciate quite how much institutional and political maturity India attained in our 75 years and the most fundamental dimension of a democracy, we have orderly transfers of power. There are enough buffers to ensure that what happens in state finances is unlikely to create macro instability. Those risks are well contained by our Constitution. The chief ministers know that they are going to be judged by development outcomes and so you can have the sugar rush of changing of pension plans or various handouts but if the cupboard is bare you are not going to be able to deliver.","Suman Bery is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China. The economist is confident that Indian states remain resilient. The world is beginning to appreciate quite how much institutional and political maturity India has attained in its 75 years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-107372016,imgsize-783694,width-400,resizemode-4/107372016.jpg"
Government's Marathon to 2047: Emphasis on Fiscal Prudence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/governments-marathon-to-2047-emphasis-on-fiscal-prudence/articleshow/107371788.cms,"What was the thinking behind keeping the vote on account absolutely straight?

So is it the idea to keep the Budget completely transparent?

The capex has risen 11.1% and there is an emphasis on infrastructure spending. But there is also the hope that the private sector will now take over and start capital spending. Given the geopolitical situation, how confident is the govt that it will pan out as planned?

Finance secretary T V Somanathan, in an interview with TOI, says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047 . Excerpts:If you see the Budget speech you will see the emphasis on 2047. The govt has set its sight on running that marathon. Running to 2047 is a marathon , it’s not a sprint. If you are going to run a marathon, you need to be in good shape and you can’t have short-term stimulants or something that will get you some yards and then it’s done.The whole focus is on making India a developed country by 2047, for which a healthy present and a strong fiscal position is an important concomitant. Some purely short term measures don’t really fit into that picture. It’s a consistent picture: focus on the long term for which you need to build strength in the short term and that needs to be done by prudence in fiscal policy and by not doing things which can detract you from that path. Not doing the wrong thing is more important than appearing to do things.The idea is that govt finances may be good, bad or indifferent depending on the times, depending on the circumstances, depending on the policies. But what is the position should be reflected as reasonably and accurately as possible. That is an emphasis. As regards the Finance Commission, again the terms of reference that have been given to them are the terms in the Constitution.What is the means by which the devolution should be done is a matter they have full discretion. They can actually take all kinds of factors into account and in a sense we felt this time based on my review of the previous commissions that the right expression would be less is more. The shorter, less prescriptive terms of reference gives full scope for all stakeholders including state govts to express their viewpoints and for the commission to take a balanced view of the different perspectives and then come to its award. Ultimately the award of the Finance Commission is about devolution and grant for which full scope has now been given to them.n There are incipient signs of private capital expenditure accelerating. There are some surveys I have seen done by some of the chambers industry, which show high levels of investment. The PMI, which is a sort of leading indicator, is also looking pretty healthy. Capacity utilisation is one reason that private sector capital expenditure doesn’t immediately pick up when the economy starts accelerating because there is surplus capacity.But increasingly I get the sense that many industries are beginning to reach levels where they have to add capacity. When that happens capital investment will happen. Another pointer also mentioned in the Budget speech you may notice that our airlines have placed large orders for planes — that is capital expenditure.When you import 1,000 aircraft, it’s just not 1,000 aircraft, there are concomitant additions to ground handling facilities, you need airports to expand, you need to employ people to do that. That means a lot of jobs. The aircraft is capital but then look at the effect it is going to have on skilled jobs. So capital expenditure is happening. I am fairly confident that we will have decent capital expenditure in the year to come and that will become a new source of acceleration.",Finance secretary T V Somanathan says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047. The capex has risen 11.1% and there is an emphasis on infrastructure spending. There are incipient signs of private capital expenditure accelerating.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-107371891,imgsize-720422,width-400,resizemode-4/107371891.jpg"
What is the Section 80C limit for tax deduction for FY 2024-25 after Interim Budget 2024?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/income-tax-budget-2024-2024-2025-section-80c-limit-epf-ppf-elss-nsc/articleshow/107353021.cms,"ALSO READ |

Income Tax Changes Budget 2024 : In the recent Budget 2024 speech, the Finance Minister kept the Section 80C tax deduction limit unchanged. The maximum limit for claiming tax benefits under Section 80C remains at Rs 1.5 lakh for the current fiscal year 2023-24 and will stay the same for individuals looking to save on taxes through Section 80C investments in the upcoming fiscal year 2024-25.Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions. Individuals can reduce their gross taxable income by up to Rs 1.5 lakh per financial year by engaging in these specific investments or expenditures.You can save on taxes through Section 80C by investing in things like Employees' Provident Fund (EPF), Public Provident Fund (PPF), Equity Linked Saving Scheme (ELSS) mutual funds, National Savings Certificate (NSC), and 5-year tax-saving fixed deposits with banks or post offices. Additionally, paying life insurance policy premiums also qualifies for tax benefits under Section 80C.It is important to note that each eligible investment comes with its specific maximum limit, rate of return, liquidity, and taxation rules for the earned returns, states ET in a report. For instance, the most you can invest in PPF in a financial year is Rs 1.5 lakh. Meanwhile, there's no limit on the amount you can invest in ELSS mutual funds, but the Section 80C deduction is capped at Rs 1.5 lakh.If individuals can't make specific investments, they can still get deductions under Section 80C from their gross taxable income through certain expenses. These expenses include repaying the principal amount of a home loan, tuition fees for children, payment of stamp duty, registration fees, and other costs related to buying a house.Since the financial year 2020-21, individuals without any business income must annually choose between the old and new tax regimes. As of the fiscal year 2023-24, the new tax regime is the default option. Consequently, individuals seeking tax deductions under Section 80C must opt for the old tax regime since this deduction isn't available in the new tax regime. It's crucial for taxpayers to be aware of these rules to make informed decisions about their tax planning and investment strategies.","Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions.

Budget 2024 focuses on youth and women entrepreneurship,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/budget-2024-focuses-on-youth-and-women-entrepreneurship/articleshow/107357923.cms,"By

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget which is an interim budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year. The budget talks about inclusive development both, social and geographical, especially for youth, women, farmers, and the poor. Continued focus on improving logistics through infrastructure spend on roads, rail, airports, ports increases productivity for companies and citizens alike.To make ‘Viksit Bharat’ by 2047, the government’s focus is on improving and empowering people’s capabilities through various skilling initiatives. It is encouraging to see that Skill India Mission has succeeded in training more than 1.4 crore youth and upskilling and reskilling 54 lakh youth. I am particularly happy to see the continued focus on youth and women entrepreneurship and the announcement of a new fund which will give interest free 50 year loans for startups will provide a domestic fillip to startups supplementing venture capital we have traditionally relied on from abroad.PM Mudra Yojana has sanctioned 43 crore loans aggregating to 22.5 lakh crore to youth entrepreneurs and thirty crore Mudra Yojana loans to women entrepreneurs. There are several other schemes like Fund of Funds, Start-Up India, and Start-Up Credit Guarantee schemes that are assisting our youth. Further, the extension of tax benefits to Start-ups and investments made by sovereign wealth funds/pension funds, till 31st March 2025 depicts the government’s effort to support the startup eco- system.This aligns quite well with India Sanitation Coalition’s efforts to give impetus to the start-up world. Over the past 7 editions of our ISC-FICCI Sanitation Awards, we have recognized and promoted several start-ups in the sanitation space, many of whom are successful businesses now!While the finance minister did not provide detailed information on Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH), the budget allocation sees a slight increase in spend demonstrating continued focus on this highly successful program. The acknowledgement that the private sector has increasingly played a substantial role in addressing WASH issues in both urban and rural areas, with numerous projects underway through Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs), highlights the government's commitment to addressing challenges in this sector.A perfect example is the LightHouse Initiative initiated by the Department of Drinking Water along with the India Sanitation Coalition (ISC) by partnering with major corporates across India to develop model villages in Solid and Liquid Waste Management (SLWM) under SBM-Grameen. From this budget, there is an expectation that the government will persist in prioritizing Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) as the path toward achieving the country's Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6). Additionally, it is hoped that the government will uphold its commitment to making necessary infrastructural investments for SLWM.The budget speech rightly celebrates the fact that we have 83 lakh SHGs and 9 crore women beneficiaries. The microfinance movement in the country and the possibility of empowering women members of SHGs through livelihood skilling is a key to bringing women into mainstream economic advancement.The focus on green growth, rooftop solar, wind, biomass, e-vehicles all help with our green energy thrust. The tourism sector was mentioned and could be a huge job provider for youth and women.Guided by the principle ‘Reform, Perform, and Transform’, the budget emphasizes efficient implementation of various policies by improving coordination with states and relevant stakeholders. This is critical both for infra spend and social programsIt is noteworthy that ISC’s Climate Resilient Coastal Cities project which is being implemented in PPP (Public-Private Partnership) mode in four coastal states of Karnataka, Gujarat, Goa and Maharashtra is congruent with the government’s priority of promoting climate-resilient activities for the blue economy 2.0, a scheme for restoration and adaptation measures, and coastal aquaculture.The budget also focuses on the Aspirational districts program where assistance will be given to the states for faster development of aspirational districts and blocks, including the generation of ample economic opportunities. This is again very crucial as it has a huge potential to transform the landscape of our country while making sure no -one is left behind.Overall, this budget has embraced economic strategies and develops the building blocks that nurture and uphold growth, promote inclusive and sustainable development, and enhance productivity.","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year.

Iyer is hopeful of a further drop in prices, especially as new technologies such as sodium-ion and aluminium-air emerge.

“Tidco is future proofing Tamil Nadu’s industrial growth”,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tidco-is-future-proofing-tamil-nadus-industrial-growth/articleshow/111042610.cms,"Tamil Nadu Industrial Development Corporation (Tidco) has been tasked with promoting non-traditional segments and building new clusters. In an interview to TOI, Tidco’s special secretary and project directorB Krishnamoorthy offers insight into how critical all this will be to achieve Tamil Nadu’s goal of becoming a $1 trillion economy by 2030. Excerpts: How is Tidco growing non-traditional segments such as aerospace, defence logistics and med tech beyond joint ventures and common usage infrastructure?The very objective of establishing Tidco back in 1965 was for Tamil Nadu’s sustained industrial development. Initially the mode was through joint ventures but subsequently the leadership of Tidco realised the changing ecosystem and started creating common usage infrastructure such as TREAT, testing facilities and centres of excellence. Now Tidco has started future proofing TN’s industrial growth by entering non-traditional segments such as aerospace and defence, logistics, life sciences in line with the changing industrial ecosystem. Tidco is also promoting the TN Emerging Sector Seed Fund to play a vital role in the startup era of today. Which non-traditional segment has the most potential to scale up quickly?India is a huge importer in aerospace and defence but focus on self-reliance has started to reverse that trend. Tamil Nadu’s core strengths in automotive, electrical and electronicS industry means it can benefit from this self-reliance initiative. Similarly, Tamil Nadu is a leader in the medicare domain. Add to that the advancement in R&D technology and it is natural to organically explore sectors such as medical devices and pharma. What’s the update on the proposed logistics park?The state govt has embarked on a mission to reduce the time and cost of transportation. Sandeep Naduri, MD of Tidco, is fast-tracking work on the proposed multimodal logistics park at Mappedu. It’s been a year since the laying of the foundation stone and Tidco has already finalised the selection of the concessionaire. Most of the land required for the project has been acquired and we are confident that this will become the first functional MMLP of the country. The second MMLP of the state will be established near Coimbatore. The land parcel has been identified and acquisition initiated. What is the update on the defence corridor being developed by Tidco?After understanding the capabilities in the state to support the A&D domain, a number of interventions have been made resulting in enhanced traction with various companies. As on date, we have a committed investment of about `20,000 crore against the target set by the Govt of India of `10,000 crore by 2024. By 2030, this corridor should contribute more than $40 million. What about your plans to set up space manufacturing parks?During the recently concluded GIM, we signed MoUs with Agnikul Cosmos, Premier Explosives and these firms will eventually move to the space parks. OneWeb is already in the process of establishing its facility in the region. We have also signed an MoU with IN-SPACe for establishing common facilities and technical guidance to space industries to set up their facilities in TNDIC. Other discussions are in advanced stages. The small satellite launch complex of ISRO will be functional by 2026, which is when the park’s occupancy will peak. We have a dream of creating a space bay around the space port at Kulasekarapattinam along the lines of the space coast of Florida. We will work with industry, ISRO and IN-SPACe to realise this. Tuticorin is getting a lot of investor attention lately from green hydrogen and EV players. Is Tidco looking at developing other pockets in south TN?Tuticorin has been a destination of major industries in the past as well. Heavy Water Plant, SPIC, TANFAC, DCW, Yokohama, India Cements have been there for a long time. Non-renewable and renewable energy plants were also aplenty in the region. The recent focus is meant to scale it up. The state govt has always been focussed on uniform industrial growth across the state. SIPCOT has been developing a large number of parks in this region such as the Furniture Park, Space Industrial Park, and expansion of Gangaikondan Industrial Park.","Tamil Nadu Industrial Development Corporation (Tidco) has been tasked with promoting non-traditional segments and building new clusters.

They use AI to help businesses harness social media,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/they-use-ai-to-help-businesses-harness-social-media/articleshow/111042618.cms,"“Now is the best time to start a business. All companies — startups and incumbents — have to reset their product strategies. If they don’t do it, AI will disrupt,” says Srivatsan Venkatesan, co-founder and the chief executive of Highperformr, sitting in his noisy office at Alwarpet junction in Chennai.This is a once-in-a-decade opportunity like the shift to cloud, he says referring to the adoption of artificial intelligence and the disruption it’s causing to the software services business. Along with Ramesh Ravishankar, he started Highperformr, a social management product, in July 2023. Love for Chennai is what unites the founding duo more than anything.After working in Silicon Valley, Srivatsan returned to Chennai and was part of few startups as a co-founder and employee since 2007, even when the ecosystem was not mature. “I always wanted to be in Chennai, it gave me the leverage to take risks,” he says.Working in startups in India and the US helped him build products rather than just remain a developer. Both founders were part of the so-called ‘Freshworks Mafia’— a group of startup founders who came out of Freshworks.Highperformr is an artificial intelligence native software as service (SaaS) product targeting B2B companies. It can generate content with context, offer collaboration, manage workflow, social selling and analytics.Chief marketing officers of companies are facing the challenge of generating sales leads without spending money as the market gets tough, says Ramesh. After completing his management studies, he sold bicycles, pay-phones, FMCG products in remote parts of India before turning to online distribution and internet industry. His rural stint helped him understand unit economics better, says Ramesh.“Sales people cannot get as many conversions as in the past; conversions are flat. Every company is targeting 5% of the customers with buy-now action. We want to flip it and target 95% of the customers who are not buying right now but may buy over time. This will build the pipeline with less investment,” he says.The startup uses multiple proprietary AI models such as ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, fine tuning and personalising them for each customer. This helps users publish and personalise at scale and find potential customers.While AI models can generate plausible sounding text, Highperformr trained with customer data, offers social media posts of tone, style and structure similar to the specified purpose and goal of the company. It has more knobs for the company to control the output.It has AI-based analytics saying which posts worked well, helping companies find potential customers, and generating leads, says Ramesh. The long-term goal is building social customer relationship management (CRM), where the platform will automate every aspect of the role from content to distribution, engagement.","Srivatsan Venkatesan and Ramesh Ravishankar started Highperformr, a social management product, in July 2023.

Women power TN startups,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/women-power-tn-startups/articleshow/111042637.cms,"E Menaka quit her job at IT major Polaris to found ‘Mannvasanai’, a startup promoting the use of traditional rice varieties and millets that are grown organically. She was inspired by G Nammalvar, green crusader and agriculture scientist, and ‘Nel’ Jayaraman, who worked to preserve traditional paddy varieties.The past 14 years were a struggle for Menaka. The tide turned this year, when Tamil Nadu Govt’s startup initiative offered `45 lakh in exchange for a minority equity stake. Menaka has since established three outlets in Chennai, besides launching packaged batter made from traditional rice varieties and millets.Sri Vidhya Bhavani M, while doing her PhD at IIT Madras, had health issues. Her father too had health problems that required frequent visits to hospitals. While running around, she felt the need for digitised health records that can be accessed by different hospitals. She and a team at IIT that worked on a blockchain-based health information system promoted a startup, Destratum Solutions, in January 2022. Compulsorily convertible debentures (CCDs) worth `25 lakh from Startup TN helped her startup to come out with a comprehensive outpatient management product called ‘Health Attai’.Erode-based Kalaiyarasi Ramachandran, a member of the weaving community, was working with an IT major after completing her MCA. But the issues faced by her community kept bothering her. She floated Raatai Handlooms, a startup manufacturing a range of ‘Do It Yourself’ handloom kits that can be used by anyone from children to senior citizens to weave their own fabrics from natural cotton and dyes. Encouraged by a `10 lakh grant from TANSEED, Kalaiyarasi has sold over 175 units of different sizes to schools to use as part of curriculum, to special children for occupational therapy and to elders to pursue as a hobby.These three are among an increasing number of women in Tamil Nadu who have promoted startups. In fact, between 2021 and now, there has been a more than four-fold jump in startups by women in Tamil Nadu. The number of DPIIT-recognised startups by women rose from 966 in 2021 to 4,259 so far this year. This is 49.1% of the startups in Tamil Nadu, which number 8,669 at present.“It is a healthy sign that more women are joining the startup ecosystem and enlarging their growth opportunities,” says C K Ranganathan, chairman, CavinKare and past president, TiE Chennai. “This also indicates that more women are becoming financially independent. Unlike the past, where they were dependent on their families and decisions were beyond their control,” he adds.M V Subramanian, general partner, July Venture, a venture capital fund, attributes the trend to the momentum of the ecosystem and efforts over so many years in the state. “It is visible because we are insisting on startup registrations for grants and funds,” he says. While TANSEED offers `10 lakh grant for startups, it is `15 lakh for startups by women. The govt also reimburses up to `2 lakh for startups by women on expenditure incurred at incubation centres.There could be some male-promoted startups strategically making women promoters. There is nothing wrong in that if it results in entrepreneurship development, say industry insiders. “Rural women have always had the entrepreneurial drive. It was the urban women who looked more at employment as a career opportunity,” says Subramanian.Sivarajah Ramanathan, mission director and CEO, StartUp TN, attributes the higher number of startups by women to the fact that more women pursue higher education in Tamil Nadu than in any other large state.A recent all-India survey on higher education by the Ministry of Education says Tamil Nadu consistently maintains a far higher gross enrolment ratio (GER) for women in higher education than other larger states. TN women have a GER of 47.3%, which is double the national average of 24%. “Exposure to higher education is giving that additional edge to women in the state,” says Sivarajah.Further, TN Govt over the past couple of years has conducted about 350 events across the state to promote entrepreneurship. Around 37,000 people, 30%-40% of them women, participated in these events. In addition, there are eight startup hubs across Tamil Nadu. At least 10 people, 40% of them women, walk in daily to discuss business ideas.","E Menaka quit her job at IT major Polaris to found ‘Mannvasanai’ Tamil Nadu Govt’s startup initiative offered `45 lakh in exchange for a minority equity stake.

At this juncture, any foul play and sabotage will worsen the already difficult water shortage being faced by the people of Delhi,"" Atishi stated in her letter.She detailed that the Delhi Jal Board has dedicated patrolling teams for the main water distribution network. These teams ensure water is safely transported from Water Treatment Plants (WTPs) to crucial underground reservoirs across the city. She added that additional support teams supervised by ADMs are also in place to assist.Delhi Water Minister Atishi said that the ground patrolling team discovered damage to water supply pipelines at certain spots.""Yesterday, our ground patrolling team reported a major leakage in our South Delhi Rising Mains, the main water pipeline that carries water from Sonia Vihar WTP to South Delhi.

The river's width, which usually measures around 70 to 80 meters in June, has now been reduced to a mere 30 to 35 meters.As a result of the declining water levels, the Ganga has receded from the ghats, revealing broken boats, scattered garbage and shattered boulders along its banks.It is evident that the river's current state can be attributed to the scorching heat and harsh sunlight.The accumulation of garbage on the banks of the Ganga highlights the significance of the river's flow, which can only be maintained when there is sufficient water in the river. Although the Ganga is considered to be life-giving, the recent heat wave has exposed the reality of Ganga water.It is worth noting that the scorching heat has persisted for the past one and a half months, causing the water in the Ganga to dry up significantly. Consequently, the lack of water has made the dirt and debris more visible along the river's banks.","The water level of the Ganga River in Varanasi has reached an all-time low due to the intense heat.

Herinckx said, ""Nike does not want their products to be shipped to Russia,"" but added, ""They are also not telling us not to do it.""According to a report from Reuters, both Nike and Lego informed that they have not authorized Herinckx's imports of their products to Russia. Reuters discovered that Herinckx's business obtains branded goods, including Nike and Lego, by using intermediaries with no apparent connection to Russia as buyers, then shipping the goods to Russia, often via Turkey, and finally delivering them to retailers in Russia.While Western governments' restrictions have primarily targeted industrial products that could be used to build weapons for Russia's war machine, companies like Herinckx's are indirectly supporting the Russian economy by providing consumers with access to foreign goods they have grown accustomed to since the collapse of communism. Customs data analysed by Reuters revealed that the value of Nike products imported to Russia plummeted 81% in 2022 to $21 million but rebounded in 2023 to at least $74 million.Legal specialists suggest that seeking recourse under Russian law would be challenging for Western brands, leaving few other legal options for enforcing intellectual property rights typically tied to the territory where the infringement occurred.

US court levies $194 million penalty on TCS,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-court-levies-194-million-penalty-on-tcs/articleshow/111007461.cms,"BENGALURU: A US court has imposed a $194 million penalty on TCS for misappropriation of US IT services firm DXC 's ((formerly CSC) trade secrets. The court said that TCS is liable to pay CSC $56 million in compensatory damages and $112 million in exemplary damages. The court also said TCS is liable for $25 million in prejudgment interest through June 13,. It also passed certain injunctions and other reliefs against TCS.

TOI had reported last year that the US jury said TCS accessed a trade secret by infringing CSC’s proprietary platforms. The latest award is a big setback to TCS after the US Supreme Court confirmed a punitive damages award of $140 million in the Epic Systems case for accessing its web portal without authorisation.

In 2018, TCS bagged a $2.5-billion deal from US-based insurer Transamerica to enhance its digital capabilities and simplify the service of more than 10 million policies into a single integrated platform. However, in June last year, Transamerica scrapped a $2 billion, 10-year deal with TCS citing the challenging macroeconomic conditions.

The DXC lawsuit in 2019 alleged that most of the former Transamerica/ MSI employees who were employed by TCS had been administering and processing policies at Transamerica / MSI using CSC software. The lawsuit cited emails exchanged between TCS employees to allege that they found the necessary solution in the Vantage software. Later, a TCS employee allegedly copied and pasted the actual Vantage source code pertaining to this calculation, and resulting Vantage calculations, into an email and sent it to his TCS colleagues. VantageOne and DXC Wealth Management Accelerator enable insurance functions including managing policies and creating new products.

TCS, a regulatory filing said, the judgement has no major adverse impact on its financials and operations.

'Procedural issues' delaying Sri Lanka debt deal: IMF,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/procedural-issues-delaying-sri-lanka-debt-deal-imf/articleshow/110987615.cms,"COLOMBO: Sri Lanka's planned foreign debt restructure after an unprecedented economic crisis has been delayed by "" procedural issues "" in negotiations with bilateral creditors including China, the International Monetary Fund said Friday.The Washington-based lender of last resort this week gave Sri Lanka the latest tranche of a rescue package designed to help repair the island nation's ruined finances after a 2022 government default.President Ranil Wickremesinghe had originally promised the restructure would be finalised before the latest $336 million disbursal, but discussions with creditors have yet to yield a deal.""There is agreement on the substance of the financial and legal terms,"" IMF Sri Lanka mission chief Peter Breuer told reporters in Colombo.""It is procedural issues that need to be resolved, and we anticipate that this will happen very soon.""Sri Lanka defaulted on its $46 billion external debt in April 2022 after the country ran out of foreign exchange to finance even essential imports such as food, fuel and medicine.Months of protests forced then president Gotabaya Rajapaksa to step down after being accused of mismanaging the island nation into its worst-ever economic crisis.His successor Wickremesinghe has since hiked taxes and drastically cut consumer subsidies in an effort to repair the government's balance sheet.Sri Lanka is due to hold a presidential election later this year and opposition parties have vowed to renegotiate the terms of the $2.9 billion IMF bailout loan.Breuer said the IMF was willing to listen to alternative proposals from rival political parties but said it was necessary to stick with the benchmarks set in the bailout deal.""Sri Lanka has made good progress in terms of getting the recovery going, but the country really isn't out of the woods yet,"" he said.""We are willing to listen to different views how these program objectives can be reached. These need to be realistic and achievable within the timeframe of the programme.""China is Sri Lanka's largest single bilateral lender and holds around 10 percent of the island's total foreign debt.Beijing had agreed ""in principle"" to restructure its share of Sri Lanka's debt in December, but neither side gave further details of the agreement and have yet to strike a formal deal.Sri Lanka's annual debt servicing is officially estimated at $6 billion with external debt, including government guaranteed borrowings, at $41.5 billion at the end of 2023, according to treasury data.",Sri Lanka defaulted on its $46 billion external debt in April 2022. President Ranil Wickremesinghe had promised the restructure would be finalised before the latest $336 million disbursal.
