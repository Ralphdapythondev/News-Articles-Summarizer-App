TDS Calculation for Senior Citizens



Senior citizen FD rates : For senior citizens looking to grow their savings through fixed deposits (FDs), there's good news: several banks are offering higher interest rates on FDs tailored specifically for them. Plus, seniors benefit from a slightly higher interest rate compared to others and a higher TDS threshold.It's important to note that the FD rates mentioned apply to deposit amounts up to Rs 2 crore.As per an ET report, here are the top interest rates offered by both public and private sector banks:DCB Bank, a private sector bank, offers interest rate of 8.6% on FDs maturing between 25 and 26 months.IDFC First Bank offers an interest rate of 8.5% on FDs maturing in 500 days.Bandhan Bank provides an interest rate of 8.35% on FDs maturing in one year.IndusInd Bank offers an interest rate of 8.25% on FDs maturing between one and two years.YES Bank offers 8.25% interest on FDs maturing between 18 months and less than two years.DBS Bank India provides an interest rate of 8% on FDs maturing between 376 and 540 days.Similarly, Karur Vysya Bank and Tamilnad Mercantile Bank (TMB) also offer an interest rate of 8% on FDs maturing in 444 days and 400 days, respectively.Source: Paisabazaar.com as quoted by ETDate: May 8, 2024Banks must deduct TDS on fixed deposits if the interest exceeds Rs 50,000 in a year, regardless of the senior citizen's tax regime. Yet, senior citizens can avoid TDS if their taxable income remains below the basic exemption limit by submitting Form 15H. This form prevents TDS deduction.Even if TDS is deducted, it's not lost forever. It's separate from income tax. If a person's tax liability is lower than the TDS deducted, the excess TDS will be refunded with interest by the Income Tax Department when filing their ITR.","Senior citizens benefit from a slightly higher interest rate compared to others.

"India signs 10-year Chabahar port pact with Iran; move to help counter Pakistan’s Gwadar port, China’s BRI",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/india-to-sign-10-year-chabahar-port-pact-with-iran-today-move-to-help-counter-pakistans-gwadar-port-chinas-bri/articleshow/110066576.cms,"Chabahar port pact

India’s Chabahar port pact to counter Pakistan , China: India has signed an agreement with Iran for the management of Chabahar Port for the next decade. This move, taking place amidst a busy election season, is seen as a significant geopolitical outreach to Iran with major regional implications.Shipping minister Sarbananda Sonowal is in Iran for the signing ceremony.This marks the first instance of India taking over the management of an overseas port. ET had earlier in the day reported about the imminent signing.Chabahar Port is viewed as India's crucial connectivity link to Afghanistan, Central Asia, and the broader Eurasian region, serving as a counterbalance to Pakistan's Gwadar port and China's Belt and Road Initiative . Plans are in place to connect Chabahar with the International North South Transport Corridor (INSTC), which links India with Russia via Iran, enabling India to bypass Pakistan and access Afghanistan and ultimately Central Asia.In April, the MEA approved a proposal by India Ports Global to assume operations at Myanmar's Sittwe Port in the Bay of Bengal. Experts noted that Sonowal's travel during a critical poll campaign underscores the significance of the agreement, which has been in the works for several years.The pact will allow India to operate the port, the expansion of which it has financed. The timing of the visit is also noteworthy, as it occurs in the midst of the West Asia crisis, which has affected key trade routes.Chabahar featured prominently in discussions between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Iranian President last year at the BRICS summit in South Africa in August, and later in November, when they spoke over the phone regarding the Gaza crisis.A pact on Chabahar was signed in 2016 during Modi's visit to Iran. In 2018, when Hassan Rouhani, then Iran president, visited India, the issue of expanding India's role at the port was a key topic of discussion. It also arose when foreign minister S Jaishankar visited Tehran in January 2024.Also Read | Indian saffron rules: Kesar selling at Rs 4.95 lakh a kg in retail - the price of nearly 70 grams of gold! The new long-term agreement aims to replace the original contract. The new agreement will have a validity of 10 years and will be automatically extended. The original pact only covers operations at the Shahid Beheshti terminal of Chabahar Port and is renewed annually.In May 2016, India signed a tripartite agreement with Iran and Afghanistan to develop the Shahid Beheshti terminal. Resource-rich but landlocked Central Asian states such as Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan have expressed keen interest in utilizing Chabahar to access the Indian Ocean Region and the Indian market. The port will also be beneficial for Indian traders and investors interested in Central Asia.Pakistan has been attempting to persuade the Central Asian states to use Karachi port for access to the Indian Ocean Region. However, India has been indicating to the Central Asian countries that Chabahar will be a more attractive proposition. Armenia is also eager to connect to the Chabahar port through the INSTC.","India has signed an agreement with Iran for the management of Chabahar Port for the next decade.

In an interview with ET Now’s Nikunj Dalmia, Raamdeo Agrawal said that India will see many Asset Management Companies (AUMs) emerging in the next few years.“In the last 25 years, total savings in the Indian economy was $10-12 trillion.But in the next 25 years, it is going to be $100 to $150 trillion and it is going to hit us every day,” he was quoted as saying. “I would think by the 10th or 12th year it will be $5-6 trillion of savings per year,” he added.According to Raamdeo Agrawal, India will see “a lot more money coming into the financial markets and that is going to give birth to larger AMCs.” “We are going to give birth to Morgan Stanley , Merrill Lynch , a big JPMorgan or big asset management company out of India with a serious scale. So, I see that part to be very exciting,” he said.Asked about which end of the market is expected to trade significantly higher in the next 5-6 years, Agrawal believes capital markets will see huge activity. He is of the view that all participants in this sector are asset-light and experiencing substantial growth. Recent results show impressive increases of 38% to 100%, driven by rising volumes and the asset-light nature of the market, which leads to operating leverage, he explained.Agrawal also noted that there is a noticeable shift from fixed income to financial products. “We accrue about Rs 17-18 lakh crore of fixed deposits in banks and only Rs 4-5 lakh crore in the stock market, if at all that number is right. So, this is too imbalanced. My sense is, incrementally, that 17-18 might not come down, they will keep on growing at 8-10% but the growth in the financial market numbers will be far higher, maybe 20%, 25% and so 5 lakh crores will go to maybe 6.5, 7 lakh crore next year,” he said.","Raamdeo Agrawal, the Chairman of Motilal Oswal group is of the view that India will give birth to many JPMorgans, Morgan Stanleys, Merrill Lynches in the coming years. “I would think by the 10th or 12th year it will be $5-6 trillion of savings per year,” he added.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110080793,imgsize-35768,width-400,resizemode-4/110080793.jpg"

The finance minister set the stage for a ""Viksit Bharat by 2047"", on the core principles of ‘Sabka Saath’, ‘Sabka Vikas’, ‘Sabka Vishwas’, with ‘Sabka Prayas’ being added as a new theme in the interim Budget.This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data i.e., farmer welfare and N for Nari utthan i.e., support for women entrepreneurs.These form the pillars of a comprehensive inclusive development. The Government's commitment to sustainable development under the strategy for Amrit Kaal includes achieving 'Net Zero' by 2070, rooftop solarization for one crore households and robust health initiatives.The Indian economy's resilience takes center stage amidst positive indicators of declining current account deficit as a percentage of GDP, falling unemployment rates, and a notable rise in digital transactions. These statistics affirm the robustness of the economy, showcasing a trajectory of growth and stability.The achievements in taxation reforms are nothing short of remarkable, with direct tax collections more than trebling in the last decade, the number of tax return filers increasing by 2.4 times, average processing time of tax returns plummeting from 93 days in FY 2013-14 to an impressive 10 days in FY 2023-24, resulting in issuance of quick refunds. These are the results of consistent progressive measures thus obviating the need for, and rightly avoiding, any last-minute populist measures.No change in existing tax rates, both for direct and indirect taxes, is a good indicator of stability and predictability for investors and taxpayers.A welcome move to waive outstanding tax demands that are minor, disputed, and unreconciled. This involves the withdrawal of outstanding direct tax demands up to Rs. 25,000 pertaining to the period up to FY 2009-10 and up to Rs.10,000 for FY 2010-11 to 2014-15.The Government's commitment to fostering a business-friendly environment is evident in its intent to extend specific tax benefits for start-ups, investments by sovereign wealth funds/ pension funds, and certain IFSC units. The extension has been made now until March 31, 2025. This might help in creating a conducive landscape for business.To align with the CBDT notification issued earlier, the provisions relating to tax collection at source concerning remittances under the Liberalized Remittance Scheme have now been formally incorporated in the Finance Bill, 2024, setting the rate at 20% for amounts exceeding Rs. 7 lakhs in a financial year.The Finance Bill, 2024 proposes an extension of the time limit for introducing the faceless scheme by the Central Government for transfer pricing proceedings, DRP Proceedings, and ITAT Proceedings, up to March 31, 2025.The interim Budget 2024 may not have proposed significant tax announcements, but it very well positioned the prelude to the full budget post the upcoming elections. Considering the potential impact on the population across the four pillars of GYAN, a sizable portion of India stands to be covered. The interim Budget’s focus on the tax front resembles a report card, highlighting the maturity achieved by our tax system. The enhancement of taxpayer services was emphasized as a key priority.","This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data and N for Nari utthan.

Interim Budget for a Viksit Bharat: It’s for everyone and all,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/interim-budget-for-a-viksit-bharat-its-for-everyone-and-all/articleshow/107497439.cms,"By Akhilesh Tuteja

The Finance Minister on February 01, 2024, delivered a truly innovative interim budget. At first glance, it did not seem like an interim budget but looked more like the budget to drive further growth and a continuum of inclusive growth-oriented investments.At the outset, this budget brings a wonderful balance between fiscal prudence and continued investment for growth.It's not easy to continue the glide path of reducing the fiscal deficit and continuing to make significant investments in all areas including infrastructure, R&D, energy transition, technology, skilling, and social welfare. The surprising reduction in fiscal deficit of 5.8% as against the budgeted 5.9% for FY24 and the projection of 5.1% in FY25 with a clear focus on increasing investments was a huge positive.This was a budget for everyone and all because it caters to every part of the Indian economy and society. The FM has carefully catered to the investment needs of various sectors. The continued focus on youth, impoverished, women and farmers to increase their involvement and contribution to economic growth is evident. By committing an 11.1% increase in capital expenditure to 11,11,111 lakh crore, the FM has clearly brought every single 1 in this growth journey.What was very impressive was the inclusion strategy of the government. The focus on women's empowerment for the past few years is unprecedented, which is reflected in the inclusion of women in the workforce moving from 23.3% to 37% in the last five years. The thirty crore Mudra Yojna loans to women entrepreneurs were a great boost to the Nari Shakti initiative. We already have over 10 million Lakhpati Didis and what is truly evident is like a corporate CFO, the FM has revised the earlier target of 20 million Lakhpati Didis to 30 million. The government also plans to invest in initiatives to encourage young girls between the ages of 9 and 14 to undertake the vaccination for cervical cancer which is again a great boost to Nari Shakti.A lot needs to be done to bring more women into all parts of economic growth but the journey so far and the vision of the future is truly inspiring.While India continues on its technological prowess and makes its mark in new technologies like Artificial Intelligence, we need a multi-pronged strategy to harness the power of AI. We need a clear focus on building AI systems in India so that we not only emerge as a global leader in this new era but can build models, which are specific to India that will benefit Indians. At the same time, we need a very wide coverage program to build skills to leverage AI to its fullest potential. The biggest contribution we can make to the inclusion of youth in the economic development of the country is by skilling them in new skill areas. In the last few years, the Skill India Mission has trained 14 million youth, reskilled over 5 million youth and established a staggering 3,000 new ITIs. The future of any country will depend as much on capital investments as on skill investments.The focus on agricultural development and support to the farmer continues through direct financial assistance to farmers. The farmers have benefited by getting crop insurance through PM Fasal Bima Yojana. It's not just the farmers, the PM-SVANidhi provides credit assistance to a large number of street vendors.The last few years have seen the journey of affordable housing through Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY). There is a slight increase in allocation to launch a scheme for encouraging the middle class to build or buy new homes. This investment will likely propel a wider economic development and increase employment.India has seen a tremendous rise in entrepreneurship in the last few years. In order to continue the journey and promote new startups, the government proposes to extend certain tax benefits, which are expiring from March 2024 to March 2025. The MSMEs have not been left behind. With a proposal to provide timely finances to such enterprises, the government has paved the way for their growth, so they can look to compete globally.All in all, it’s a truly inclusive budget with a clear focus on development not just by giving away freebies but enabling the people to participate in the economic development activity. While the FM calls the comprehensive GDP - Governance, Development & Performance – to me, this budget is inclusive of another GDP – gender, demography, and professions.","Akhilesh Tuteja is Partner and Head, Clients and Markets, KPMG in India.

‘Enough domestic sources of demand to counter drag from external sector’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/enough-domestic-sources-of-demand-to-counter-drag-from-external-sector/articleshow/107372012.cms,"Do you think the

creates room for lower interest rates?

One of the issues that the Budget has flagged is the demographic challenge and opportunity and the societal change that is taking place. How do you view this?

Niti Aayog is working on the Viksit Bharat roadmap. What will be the focus areas?

You are as much a representative of the Centre as well as the states. Is it time to revisit the entire formula for transfers to states particularly on the issue of cesses and surcharges?

Suman Bery , who heads Niti Aayog , the govt think tank, is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China, which he says is also an opportunity for India. The economist is confident that Indian states remain resilient. Excerpts of the interview with TOI.The finance ministry expects the economy to grow 7% next year.Given the global situation, how do you see the prospects?The belief in the finance ministry is that we have a possible drag coming from the external sector but that we have other sources. We have enough domestic sources of demand. One has to applaud the political and economic judgment of FM in deciding that it was appropriate to pursue the path of fiscal consolidation. There is transparency. What this actually reflects is responsible economic management, which is one reason we are where we are. Second, it also creates a buffer so that there is policy space if we do encounter headwinds.That’s the hope and expectation. We have an independent central bank and an inflation targeting central bank, so it is up to the monetary policy committee to take a call through the monetary policy committee on the repo rate .The PM has said that when India grows its states grow. India is a composite of 37 states and UTs. They are each at very different points in their demographic transition. There are some states where the net replacement rate is down to 1%, like Kerala . There are others, particularly UP and Bihar, which are in their earliest stage of demographic transition and each one of these states is the size of a large European country. There are two implications of that — one is internal labour mobility and it will become an even larger part of our growth model. The govt has taken several steps to create a unified market. Our main endowment is our human capital and that has to be equipped to participate in global exchange in many ways. We know from China, Japan that the demographic dividend partly depends on markets and on human capital. But the golden period is fairly short lived, about 15 years, when the so called dependency ratio declines. The other big opportunity the PM has been highlighting is bringing women much more into the active labour force.When Niti was set up there was the idea of a three-year vision and a seven-year strategy paper. The reality is that schemes of govt tend to be aligned with the award of the Finance Commission . There are various established building blocks or hand holds which are already a matter of govt policy. The PM is much more interested in a national debate on what it means to be a Viksit Bharat or modern society. We have a collective goal and it is for the democratic polity to define what that goal should be. Its emphatically not for a super mandarin bureaucracy. It is not going to be Lee Kwan Yew’s Singapore led from the top.It’s entirely a finance ministry matter but I would be lying if I didn’t say when I visit certain states there is this complaint. A big frontier would be resource mobilisation at the state level. Second is going to be rationalisation of subsidies not only at the Union level, but also at the state level. All chief ministers sit on my governing council. When they convene as the governing council, I see them in their role as development practitioners. The world is beginning to appreciate quite how much institutional and political maturity India attained in our 75 years and the most fundamental dimension of a democracy, we have orderly transfers of power. There are enough buffers to ensure that what happens in state finances is unlikely to create macro instability. Those risks are well contained by our Constitution. The chief ministers know that they are going to be judged by development outcomes and so you can have the sugar rush of changing of pension plans or various handouts but if the cupboard is bare you are not going to be able to deliver.","Suman Bery is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China.

Government's Marathon to 2047: Emphasis on Fiscal Prudence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/governments-marathon-to-2047-emphasis-on-fiscal-prudence/articleshow/107371788.cms,"What was the thinking behind keeping the vote on account absolutely straight?

So is it the idea to keep the Budget completely transparent?

The capex has risen 11.1% and there is an emphasis on infrastructure spending. But there is also the hope that the private sector will now take over and start capital spending. Given the geopolitical situation, how confident is the govt that it will pan out as planned?

Finance secretary T V Somanathan, in an interview with TOI, says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047 . Excerpts:If you see the Budget speech you will see the emphasis on 2047. The govt has set its sight on running that marathon.Running to 2047 is a marathon , it’s not a sprint. If you are going to run a marathon, you need to be in good shape and you can’t have short-term stimulants or something that will get you some yards and then it’s done.The whole focus is on making India a developed country by 2047, for which a healthy present and a strong fiscal position is an important concomitant. Some purely short term measures don’t really fit into that picture. It’s a consistent picture: focus on the long term for which you need to build strength in the short term and that needs to be done by prudence in fiscal policy and by not doing things which can detract you from that path. Not doing the wrong thing is more important than appearing to do things.The idea is that govt finances may be good, bad or indifferent depending on the times, depending on the circumstances, depending on the policies. But what is the position should be reflected as reasonably and accurately as possible. That is an emphasis. As regards the Finance Commission, again the terms of reference that have been given to them are the terms in the Constitution.What is the means by which the devolution should be done is a matter they have full discretion. They can actually take all kinds of factors into account and in a sense we felt this time based on my review of the previous commissions that the right expression would be less is more. The shorter, less prescriptive terms of reference gives full scope for all stakeholders including state govts to express their viewpoints and for the commission to take a balanced view of the different perspectives and then come to its award. Ultimately the award of the Finance Commission is about devolution and grant for which full scope has now been given to them.n There are incipient signs of private capital expenditure accelerating. There are some surveys I have seen done by some of the chambers industry, which show high levels of investment. The PMI, which is a sort of leading indicator, is also looking pretty healthy. Capacity utilisation is one reason that private sector capital expenditure doesn’t immediately pick up when the economy starts accelerating because there is surplus capacity.But increasingly I get the sense that many industries are beginning to reach levels where they have to add capacity. When that happens capital investment will happen. Another pointer also mentioned in the Budget speech you may notice that our airlines have placed large orders for planes — that is capital expenditure.When you import 1,000 aircraft, it’s just not 1,000 aircraft, there are concomitant additions to ground handling facilities, you need airports to expand, you need to employ people to do that. That means a lot of jobs. The aircraft is capital but then look at the effect it is going to have on skilled jobs. So capital expenditure is happening. I am fairly confident that we will have decent capital expenditure in the year to come and that will become a new source of acceleration.",Finance secretary T V Somanathan says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047.

What is the Section 80C limit for tax deduction for FY 2024-25 after Interim Budget 2024?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/income-tax-budget-2024-2024-2025-section-80c-limit-epf-ppf-elss-nsc/articleshow/107353021.cms,"ALSO READ |

Income Tax Changes Budget 2024 : In the recent Budget 2024 speech, the Finance Minister kept the Section 80C tax deduction limit unchanged. The maximum limit for claiming tax benefits under Section 80C remains at Rs 1.5 lakh for the current fiscal year 2023-24 and will stay the same for individuals looking to save on taxes through Section 80C investments in the upcoming fiscal year 2024-25.Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions. Individuals can reduce their gross taxable income by up to Rs 1.5 lakh per financial year by engaging in these specific investments or expenditures.You can save on taxes through Section 80C by investing in things like Employees' Provident Fund (EPF), Public Provident Fund (PPF), Equity Linked Saving Scheme (ELSS) mutual funds, National Savings Certificate (NSC), and 5-year tax-saving fixed deposits with banks or post offices. Additionally, paying life insurance policy premiums also qualifies for tax benefits under Section 80C.It is important to note that each eligible investment comes with its specific maximum limit, rate of return, liquidity, and taxation rules for the earned returns, states ET in a report. For instance, the most you can invest in PPF in a financial year is Rs 1.5 lakh. Meanwhile, there's no limit on the amount you can invest in ELSS mutual funds, but the Section 80C deduction is capped at Rs 1.5 lakh.If individuals can't make specific investments, they can still get deductions under Section 80C from their gross taxable income through certain expenses. These expenses include repaying the principal amount of a home loan, tuition fees for children, payment of stamp duty, registration fees, and other costs related to buying a house.Since the financial year 2020-21, individuals without any business income must annually choose between the old and new tax regimes. As of the fiscal year 2023-24, the new tax regime is the default option. Consequently, individuals seeking tax deductions under Section 80C must opt for the old tax regime since this deduction isn't available in the new tax regime. It's crucial for taxpayers to be aware of these rules to make informed decisions about their tax planning and investment strategies.","Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions.

Budget 2024 focuses on youth and women entrepreneurship,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/budget-2024-focuses-on-youth-and-women-entrepreneurship/articleshow/107357923.cms,"By

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget which is an interim budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year. The budget talks about inclusive development both, social and geographical, especially for youth, women, farmers, and the poor. Continued focus on improving logistics through infrastructure spend on roads, rail, airports, ports increases productivity for companies and citizens alike.To make ‘Viksit Bharat’ by 2047, the government’s focus is on improving and empowering people’s capabilities through various skilling initiatives. It is encouraging to see that Skill India Mission has succeeded in training more than 1.4 crore youth and upskilling and reskilling 54 lakh youth. I am particularly happy to see the continued focus on youth and women entrepreneurship and the announcement of a new fund which will give interest free 50 year loans for startups will provide a domestic fillip to startups supplementing venture capital we have traditionally relied on from abroad.PM Mudra Yojana has sanctioned 43 crore loans aggregating to 22.5 lakh crore to youth entrepreneurs and thirty crore Mudra Yojana loans to women entrepreneurs. There are several other schemes like Fund of Funds, Start-Up India, and Start-Up Credit Guarantee schemes that are assisting our youth. Further, the extension of tax benefits to Start-ups and investments made by sovereign wealth funds/pension funds, till 31st March 2025 depicts the government’s effort to support the startup eco- system.This aligns quite well with India Sanitation Coalition’s efforts to give impetus to the start-up world. Over the past 7 editions of our ISC-FICCI Sanitation Awards, we have recognized and promoted several start-ups in the sanitation space, many of whom are successful businesses now!While the finance minister did not provide detailed information on Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH), the budget allocation sees a slight increase in spend demonstrating continued focus on this highly successful program. The acknowledgement that the private sector has increasingly played a substantial role in addressing WASH issues in both urban and rural areas, with numerous projects underway through Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs), highlights the government's commitment to addressing challenges in this sector.A perfect example is the LightHouse Initiative initiated by the Department of Drinking Water along with the India Sanitation Coalition (ISC) by partnering with major corporates across India to develop model villages in Solid and Liquid Waste Management (SLWM) under SBM-Grameen. From this budget, there is an expectation that the government will persist in prioritizing Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) as the path toward achieving the country's Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6). Additionally, it is hoped that the government will uphold its commitment to making necessary infrastructural investments for SLWM.The budget speech rightly celebrates the fact that we have 83 lakh SHGs and 9 crore women beneficiaries. The microfinance movement in the country and the possibility of empowering women members of SHGs through livelihood skilling is a key to bringing women into mainstream economic advancement.The focus on green growth, rooftop solar, wind, biomass, e-vehicles all help with our green energy thrust. The tourism sector was mentioned and could be a huge job provider for youth and women.Guided by the principle ‘Reform, Perform, and Transform’, the budget emphasizes efficient implementation of various policies by improving coordination with states and relevant stakeholders. This is critical both for infra spend and social programsIt is noteworthy that ISC’s Climate Resilient Coastal Cities project which is being implemented in PPP (Public-Private Partnership) mode in four coastal states of Karnataka, Gujarat, Goa and Maharashtra is congruent with the government’s priority of promoting climate-resilient activities for the blue economy 2.0, a scheme for restoration and adaptation measures, and coastal aquaculture.The budget also focuses on the Aspirational districts program where assistance will be given to the states for faster development of aspirational districts and blocks, including the generation of ample economic opportunities. This is again very crucial as it has a huge potential to transform the landscape of our country while making sure no -one is left behind.Overall, this budget has embraced economic strategies and develops the building blocks that nurture and uphold growth, promote inclusive and sustainable development, and enhance productivity.","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year.

Poll-related uncertainties and selling by foreign funds are weighing on market sentiment , dealers and analysts said.The sensex opened the new trading week on a weak note and was down nearly 200 points from its Friday close.By mid-session it slid to an intra-day low at 71,866 points, then rallied to an intra-day high at 71,864 points and closed at 72,776, up 112 points.On the NSE, the nifty closed 49 points up at 22,104.As was seen in the past few weeks, foreign portfolio investors remained net sellers while domestic institutional investors were net buyers. At close of day's trading, DIIs were net buyers at Rs 3,563 crore while FPIs recorded a net outflow of Rs 4,499 crore, BSE data showed. So far in May, foreign funds have net sold stocks worth nearly Rs 22,800 crore, data from CDSL and BSE showed. In contrast DIIs have net bought stocks worth nearly Rs 23,000 crore, BSE data showed.Fund managers and institutional dealers said that with China and Hong Kong markets, for long an underperformer, showing some smart up move recently, some foreign fund managers are taking money out of India and putting the funds in those markets.Volatility is another concern for domestic investors. The 998-point intra-day swing in the sensex was reflected in India VIX that scaled an intra-day high at 21.5, a level not seen since September 2022.Brokers feel that a relatively low voter turnout in the current Lok Sabha polls is a cause for concern that could lead to some unpredictable outcome. When the first phase of polling started on April 19, most on Dalal Street were predicting a resounding victory for the ruling NDA. ""Going ahead, markets would take cues from the voter's turnout data from the fourth phase (of Lok Sabha polls), which has been a major concern so far,"" said Siddhartha Khemka, Head - Retail Research, Motilal Oswal Financial Services .In Monday's session, the smart recovery in the sensex came on the back of strong buying in HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and TCS while strong selling in stocks like Tata Motors, Bharti Airtel and SBI limited the index's gain for the day.Of the 30 sensex stocks, 16 closed higher while 14 closed in the red. In the broader market, laggards outnumbered winners with 2,254 stocks closing lower to 1,707 closing higher, BSE data showed.","The sensex gyrated nearly 1,000 points Monday while India VIX, a measure for volatility, jumped to 21.5, a multi-month high.

91 cases of new Covid variant KP.2 identified in Maharashtra

Maharashtra has detected 91 Omicron KP.2 cases, with Pune reporting 51 and Thane 20. The variant emerged globally in January and became dominant by March-April. Dr Karyakarte highlighted low hospitalization rates, with KP.2 being part of the FLiRT variants.

FLiRT, the new COVID variants are circulating fast: All about symptoms, severity

FLiRT variants, KP.2 & KP.1.1, dominate US infections with Omicron symptoms. KP.2's reproduction number surpasses JN.1. WHO monitors the variants' impact on vaccine immunity and advises close observation for major virus changes.

93 riots case: SC tells state to implement directions

Supreme Court directs Maharashtra to address 1992 Mumbai riots cases, compensate missing victims' families, implement police reforms, and comply with Justice B N Srikrishna Commission recommendations by July 19, including tracing 168 missing people.

MUMBAI: The state has identified 91 cases of the new Covid-19 Omicron subvariant KP.2 that has outpaced the previously circulating JN.1 variant and is now driving cases in many countries. Pune reported 51 cases and Thane 20 cases of KP.2, first detected globally in Jan. Currently, KP.2 is the dominant variant in the US. Maharashtra identified KP.2 cases in January.By March and April, it became the dominant strain in the region. However, there hasn’t been any proportionate increase in hospitalisations or serious cases, said Dr Rajesh Karyakarte, state’s genome sequencing coordinator. KP.2 descended from JN.1, which was the predominant Covid strain by the end of 2023. In March, the state witnessed a slight surge in cases, averaging around 250 detections, which is likely attributable to the spread of the KP.2 variant.Besides Pune and Thane, seven cases each were identified in Amravati and Aurangabad. Solapur had two cases while Ahmednagar, Nashik, Latur and Sanglione each of the KP.2 variant. None was from Mumbai.The recently identified group of variants, collectively known as FLiRT, primarily consists of the KP.1.1 and KP.2 strains. The nomenclature of these strains is derived from the specific mutations they possess, with one strain containing mutations represented by the letters ""F"" and ""L"", while the other strain features mutations denoted by the letters ""R"" and ""T"".","Maharashtra has detected 91 Omicron KP.2 cases, with Pune reporting 51 and Thane 20.

UBS CEO warns about risk of delays to tech integration,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/ubs-ceo-warns-about-risk-of-delays-to-tech-integration/articleshow/110092678.cms,"Don't overshoot

ZURICH: UBS CEO Sergio Ermotti warned on Monday that any delay to the integration of its technology and data with those of former rival Credit Suisse would erode planned cost savings, as he vowed to see the process through and stay on until 2027.Under Ermotti, who returned to UBS last year after it bought Credit Suisse in an emergency rescue, Switzerland's last remaining global bank faces a pivotal year in which it must combine IT systems and migrate clients, possibly a trickier stage than the period until now.""We are pretty convinced that our real risk is a delay, rather than are we able to execute or not,"" Ermotti told a Reuters newsmaker event.UBS is integrating 300 of 3,000 Credit Suisse applications and the bank is trying to reduce the risks for clients as it combines platforms, he said.""The real risk is to have to delay the realizations of synergies. So in that sense, of course, we need to plan and to be credible in what we do. I'm confident that we are moving in the right direction, but we are not complacent,"" Ermotti added.Migration of Credit Suisse clients to UBS platforms begins this year, and a target of decommissioning 30% of Credit Suisse apps would be the ""maximum"" achievable in 2024, the CEO said.UBS has seen its shares soar since the takeover, with investors upbeat about the prospects for the combined group given low acquisition costs, a huge increase in assets and an integration process that has so far gone relatively smoothly.UBS expects $13 billion in cost savings from the acquisition, which Ermotti said would mostly come from reducing staff numbers but also from merging IT systems.He refused to be drawn on how many people would lose jobs, saying only that it would be a ""painful exercise"". The bank, which employs more than 111,000 people, will try to reduce workforce through early retirements, attrition and outsourcing where possible but job cuts were ""inevitable"", he said.Ermotti, 64, acknowledged that in the drive to complete the integration, there was a risk UBS would miss out on the focus on generative AI sweeping companies.In a competitive landscape ""changing very fast"" it was vital staff had the ""best tools to be successful"", he said.Ermotti pledged to lead UBS ""at the very least"" until the integration was finished at the end of 2026 or early 2027.That meant that talk of succession planning was not top of his to-do list, although he intends to present internal candidates as he did when he last left UBS in 2020.""Our goal is to really increase dramatically the chances that we can have an internal candidate,"" he said.Ermotti was originally propelled into the role of chief executive at UBS in 2011 by a rogue trader scandal. He helped rehabilitate the bank - which had sought state support in the global financial crisis - before leaving nine years later.Aside from the challenges of integration, UBS also faces regulatory and political headwinds, as Swiss authorities seek to safeguard the banking system and improve policing of lenders.Ermotti, who hails from Switzerland's Italian-speaking canton of Ticino, said that while he agreed with most of the government's recent proposals to make Swiss banking safer, he did not agree with plans to make UBS hold more capital.""When you talk about the only areas where we believe it's appropriate not to overshoot is the areas around capital,"" he said. ""Switzerland benefits from having a strong financial system, a strong competitive UBS is part of that equation and UBS stakeholders also benefit from being a Swiss-based company.""He said that the acquisition of Credit Suisse meant UBS already needed to put aside $20 billion extra in capital.Ermotti was Europe's best-paid bank boss last year, earning 14.4 million Swiss francs. The pay drew criticism from Switzerland's finance minister, who said she would have to work for 30 years to earn as much.","UBS CEO Sergio Ermotti warns any delay to the integration of its technology and data with those of former rival Credit Suisse would erode planned cost savings.

UAW seeks tough victory at Mercedes plant in Alabama,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/uaw-seeks-tough-victory-at-mercedes-plant-in-alabama/articleshow/110085856.cms,"NEW DELHI: The United Auto Workers ( UAW ) union is facing an important test as workers at a Mercedes-Benz plant in Alabama began voting Monday on whether to join the labor group.The vote comes after a significant victory for the UAW at a Volkswagen factory in Tennessee, and a win in Alabama would mark a major milestone in the union's efforts to organize automakers across the country and help in its declining membership.Meanwhile, the company has encouraged workers to vote against unionization. Employees at the plant also reported that Mercedes hired anti-union firms to communicate with workers.However, the company has denied allegations of preventing union organizing efforts in Alabama, with a spokeswoman stating that Mercedes respects employees' unionizing efforts and is ensuring every worker has the opportunity to vote by secret ballot while having access to the information needed to make an informed decision.The voting process will involve 5,200 employees at the assembly plant and a nearby battery factory, with final results expected to be announced on Friday. UAW President Shawn Fain, who assumed the role in March 2023, has been strategizing for over a year to win the support of non-union auto workers. His efforts began with negotiating new labor contracts in Detroit, which involved leading the union through its first simultaneous strike against General Motors, Ford, and Jeep-maker Stellantis. The six-week walkout resulted in record agreements, including a ""25% wage increase and the return of cost-of-living adjustments.""Securing a strong presence in Detroit was essential for gaining support from workers in the southern states, according to Fain.Inside the Mercedes factory, where employees manufacture both electric and gas-powered SUVs, the contracts negotiated in Detroit became a compelling argument in favor of the UAW.""That is the biggest thing that we're using to push because we can show how much the union can win now,"" said Jacob Ryan, a Mercedes employee who backs the union due to his belief that the company has failed to sufficiently address worker concerns regarding compensation, working hours, and benefits.Ryan, a full-time employee at the plant for approximately five years, has been advocating for unionization since before Fain's election.Less than two years ago, he and other organizers faced difficulties in getting even 20% of workers to sign cards in support of the UAW. Currently, the plant has a supermajority of those cards, as reported by the UAW, which generally files for an NLRB election once a facility reaches a threshold of 70% of workers in favor of joining. However, the factory is located deep in the American South, a region that has traditionally been more resistant to unions. In one of its most recent attempts in August 2017, the UAW suffered a 2-to-1 defeat in a vote at Nissan's Canton, Mississippi, plant.The UAW faces a formidable challenge in securing a victory at the Mercedes plant in Alabama, where union activity has been historically low, according to Kate Andrias, a labor law expert at Columbia Law School. ""The challenge is very significant to win at the Mercedes plant and in states like Alabama ... where there really has been so little union activity,"" said Andrias.Workers and labor professors have observed that Mercedes has conducted a more aggressive anti-union campaign compared to VW. The company has organized meetings led by executives and external labor firms, emphasizing the potential risks of joining the UAW, based on worker accounts and audio recordings reviewed by Reuters. The plant has also displayed signage urging workers to ""vote no,"" as evidenced by employee reports and photographs.Unlike the UAW's successful campaign at VW, which required two attempts, this is the first election at the Mercedes plant. Art Wheaton, a labor professor at Cornell University, noted that the UAW may not have invested as much time and resources in Vance, Alabama, compared to their efforts in Chattanooga. However, the UAW recently reached an agreement on a new labor contract for Daimler Truck employees at several Southern facilities. Daimler Truck was previously part of the same company as Mercedes.Southern state governments have strongly opposed unionization efforts. Six governors, including Alabama's Kay Ivey, signed a letter urging workers to reject the UAW, arguing that unionization would hinder the growth of the auto industry in the region.During meetings with workers, company leaders and external firms have suggested that employees wait and observe the outcome of the VW contract negotiations, citing instances where negotiations at other companies have taken up to 400 days.Some employees believe that Mercedes is at last addressing the issues raised by its workforce. The company has recently appointed Federico Kochlowski as the new president of its U.S. operations, a move that has instilled confidence in certain workers.""We as team members, without a union in there right now, we really have a great advantage,"" Howell said. ""They clearly understand that we are not happy and they are listening.""Melissa Howell, who has been with the company for 18 years, is concerned that introducing a union at this point could disrupt the positive changes that are currently underway. She feels that the workers have a significant opportunity to be heard and have their concerns addressed without the need for union representation.",The United Auto Workers ( UAW ) union is facing an important test as workers at a Mercedes-Benz plant in Alabama began voting on whether to join the labor group. The vote comes after a significant victory for the UAW at a Volkswagen factory in Tennessee. A win in Alabama would mark a major milestone in the union's efforts to organize automakers across the country.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110088325,imgsize-760675,width-400,resizemode-4/110088325.jpg"

The projected growth is rooted in the rising demand for immersive experiences and the radical progress of VR technologies.While many VR coins have emerged in the crypto market, 5th Scape is one of the few that shows promise. The white paper and roadmap reflect the research and ambition that have gone into the project.5th Scape is powered by $5SCAPE tokens, which will unlock a wide range of premium experiences in the community. It is used for purchasing games, accessing premium content, and acquiring the latest VR hardware.Most investors are hoarding the token at low prices in the presale to gain a profitable entry point into its anticipated bull run. But holding $5SCAPE tokens has other benefits. To begin with, it gives complimentary access to a library of VR games. SCAPE holders can also access educational content, movies, and animations within the project's entertainment hub. The token is used to reward developers for keeping the cycle of innovation moving within the ecosystem.Developers who create and list VR experiences on 5th Scape will be eligible for 70% of the subscription revenues paid in 5SCAPE tokens. Investors, on the other hand, can stake their tokens to earn passive income.80% of the total 5SCAPE supply is set aside for presale investors. The remainder goes to treasury, project development, and liquidity. 40% of the presale investments are unlocked at the TGE. This will be followed by an 8-week lock and an 8-month vesting period. This prevents early-stage sell-offs and promotes long-term holding, supporting the token's sustainable price action. Both the tokenomics and roadmap are designed for the long-term growth of the project.With $5.8M raised already, the $5SCAPE presale is looking at an early sell-out. The investor traffic is growing. The presale is divided into multiple stages, with a gradual price increase. In the current stage, it is selling for $0.00327 per unit. The tentative listing price is $0.01, 205.81% above the current presale price. In the next presale stage, the price will increase 14.98% to $0.00376.As one of the promising VR crypto projects to ever enter the market, 5th Scape holds large growth potential. Once the token hits the exchanges, early investors could benefit generously from the presale entry.","VR coin 5th Scape ($5SCAPE) has crossed the $5.8M milestone in its sensational presale.

Tokens that list on Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange , frequently experience price surges when they begin trading on the exchange. For crypto traders and investors, that means anticipating what tokens will list on Binance in the near future is a strategy for finding profits.Here is a lost promising token that could earn a spot on Binance later this year.Keep reading for the six upcoming Binance listings to watch our for today. Dogeverse is a new meme coin that’s launching simultaneously on six different blockchains: Ethereum, Solana, Polygon, Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche, and Base. It’s a highly unusual approach with a lot of promise to unite the crypto ecosystem.With $DOGEVERSE, token holders will seamlessly hop between networks with ultra-low gas fees. The meme coin could enable more trading, new DeFi applications, and a wide range of Web3 projects that use the best elements of different blockchains.The Dogeverse presale has been incredibly hot, raising more than $15 million in just a few weeks. Presale investors not only get a discount on the $DOGEVERSE token but also the option to stake their tokens for 68% APY rewards.The sale has a hard cap of $17 million, so it’s likely to sell out within a matter of days. $DOGEVERSE is likely to achieve centralised exchange listings quickly after launch, and it may not be long before Binance announces trading on this meme coin.99Bitcoins is a popular crypto education platform that’s introducing a new $99BTC token to enable students of crypto to earn rewards while they learn. For every interactive lesson users complete on 99Bitcoins, they’ll earn $99BTC. The token can then be used to unlock even more exclusive educational content as well as crypto trading signals and discounts with 99Bitcoins partners.The $99BTC token has the potential to list on Binance soon because the community around it is already huge. 99Bitcoins boasts nearly 80 hours of interactive lessons and a subscriber base of more than 2.8 million. With numbers like that, there will be a lot of pressure for Binance to list the $99BTC token.Investors can join the 99Bitcoins presale now and stake their tokens to earn 1,469% APY—an extremely generous reward rate that makes buying $99BTC potentially even more profitable. The presale has already raised more than $1.1 million.There’s also $99k worth of Bitcoin up for grabs via an airdrop available to 99 users who join during the presale phase.WienerAI is an exciting new meme coin with utility. The project has set out to build a powerful AI crypto trading bot that can help users outrun MEV bots and find the most lucrative opportunities in crypto price action. On top of that, WienerAI plans to offer a swap to facilitate trades with zero fees.The project’s fun wiener dog mascot offers this meme coin a chance to go viral. The mascot is part wiener dog, part AI, and part mad scientist, and WienerAI has dubbed its community the ‘Sausage Army’—a name that lends itself well to growing a social following. As the Sausage Army grows and WienerAI executes on its roadmap, there will be a lot of pressure on Binance to list its $WAI token.$WAI is available to buy on presale now, and early investors can benefit from 651% APY when they stake their purchased tokens. The presale is off to a strong start, raising more than $1.4 million in its first 10 days.Grok is an Ethereum-based meme coin based on—but not affiliated with—Grok, the AI chatbot created by xAI. The meme coin sits at the intersection of AI and the founder of xAI, who’s also one of the most prominent figures in crypto.The $GROK token has been hugely successful since it launched last October. For some time, it held a market cap of over $100 million and currently has more than 19,000 token holders. Although $GROK has seen its share of price ups and downs, it’s currently trading with bullish momentum and is the #1 trending token on crypto data platform DEXTools. Binance isn’t shy about listing meme coins. So, $GROK could be on the shortlist for the exchange if the current momentum turns into a full-fledged pumpLopeCoin is another meme coin that could be among the next Binance listings in 2024. This Binance Smart Chain-based meme coin features an adorable fox mascot and a ton of utility. To start, the team behind $LOPE plans to build a decentralised token swap, an NFT marketplace, and a play-to-earn adventure game.opeCoin is also leveraging AI to create a chatbot and an image-generation tool specifically for memes. The AI could also offer trading tips, turning LopeCoin into an all-in-one ecosystem for meme coin enthusiasts. LopeCoin is still in its presale, but the project has been audited, and the development team is KYC verified. In just a few days, the project has sold more than $1 million worth of LOPE tokens, signalling that this is a coin worth watching.Shiba Shootout is a play-to-earn crypto coin that builds on the popular doge meme and adds a Western frontier theme. The game promises players the ability to roam the virtual plains, explore Old West towns, and participate in blazing gun battles after dark.The project also strongly emphasizes community. Campfire stories enable $SHIBASHOOT token holders to share their best meme coin experiences. Token holders can also earn referral rewards and participate in the platform’s development through voting.Shiba Shootout is currently holding a presale, and it’s off to a fast start, with more than $300,000 raised in its first few days. Early investors can earn 4,095% APY, which is a big incentive to join. The project’s combination of memes, crypto gaming, and governance is likely to appeal to Binance, which could list $SHIBASHOOT after the project completes its ICO.","The Dogeverse presale has been incredibly hot, raising more than $15 million in just a few weeks.

Etihad to make the most of Abu Dhabi’s US pre-clearance to attract more Indian travellers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/etihad-to-make-the-most-of-abu-dhabis-us-pre-clearance-to-attract-more-indian-travellers/articleshow/110054749.cms,"CHENNAI: Come September and Etihad will tap into the huge demand for travel between India and America in a big way. While the airline’s Abu Dhabi hub, Zayed International Airport , has for years had US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) facility that lets flyers clear US immigration and customs there itself (thereby skip long queues on arrival), it is making some big changes to get a bigger pie of the lucrative India-US market .The Zayed Airport recently got a new terminal. The US CBP is currently housed in the old terminal. “This September the CBP will move to the new terminal that will, among other things, have a dedicated first and business class lounge especially for pre-cleared (to US) passengers. Also we have deepened our partnership with two US carriers — American Airlines and Jet Blue. So our pre-cleared passengers will get seamless connections to a large number of cities in the shortest possible time starting at 45 minutes after flying into the US on our flights. The baggage will also be through checked-in to the final destination there with passengers not required to collect them in the first port of arrival in the US. Ditto on the way back,” Arik De, Etihad’s chief revenue & commercial officer, told TOI.“With all the checks out of the way before you take-off, you can simply pick up your bags and go when you land in the US. Abu Dhabi has only CBP facility in the Middle East,” he added. Etihad currently flies to New York (JFK), Chicago, Boston and Washington. It plans to double its US presence before the end of this decade. With its pre-clearance USP, Etihad is eying the India market in a big way for filling up its flights to and from the US — a market where neighbours Emirates and Qatar Airways are both very strong in.The airline is among the rare Gulf carriers that still has room, read bilaterals, for more flights to India. “Abu Dhabi has 50,000 seats per week to India of which along with Air Arabia Abu Dhabi about 42,000 seats are being used. We are increasing flights to Bengaluru (going from 14 to 18 weekly); Kolkata (going to 7 to 8 weekly) and starting four times weekly to Jaipur on June 16. The next round of expansion in India will be in January-March 2025 when we get more planes,” said Kolkata-born De, who is among the first Indian origin professionals to rise to top positions at a leading Gulf carrier.Etihad is making more changes to attract more Indian passengers. For instance, he has changed something a majority of Gulf carriers don’t do — they don’t take meals from India for their flights back home as meals for both the route to India and back are uplifted at their hubs only. “Of the 11 cities in India that we fly to, meal is being uplifted from 8-9 of them in India only now. That ensures we serve fresh meals to passengers from India to Abu Dhabi,” said De, a Canadian national.Etihad has 5-6,000 crew members, of which Indians, Moroccans and Romanians comprise the biggest numbers.He does not see the long haul plans of IndiGo — which has ordered wide bodies now — and the growth of Air India as a challenge to Etihad. “A country of over 1.3 billion people with a booming economy, India certainly will have its own big airlines. There will always be market for both the nonstop product (that AI offers far and wide and IndiGo will offer from next year). For example, Mumbai-London has nonstops from AI, Vistara, British Airways and Virgin Atlantic. Yet we have 12% market share on that route,” De said.Etihad currently has 90 aircraft. It aims to have a fleet of 165-170 planes — almost as many wide and narrow bodies — by 2030.","Etihad is making big changes to get a bigger pie of the lucrative India-US market.

Chinese companies win more bids to explore for Iraq oil and gas,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/chinese-companies-win-more-bids-to-explore-for-iraq-oil-and-gas/articleshow/110053358.cms,"CAIRO: Chinese companies ZhenHua and CNOOC Iraq have won bids to explore Iraqi oil and gas fields, Iraq's oil minister said as the Middle East country's hydrocarbon exploration licensing round continued into its second day on Sunday.The oil and gas licences for 29 projects are mainly aimed at ramping up output for domestic use, with more than 20 companies pre-qualifying, including European, Chinese, Arab and Iraqi groups.Chinese companies have been the only foreign players to win bids, taking seven oil and gas fields since Saturday, while Iraqi Kurdish company KAR Group took two.There were notably no U.S. oil majors involved, even after Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia met representatives of U.S. companies on an official visit to the United States last month.China's CNOOC Iraq won a bid to develop Iraq's Block 7 for oil exploration that extends across the country's central and southern provinces of Diwaniya, Babil, Najaf, Wasit and Muthanna, Iraq's oil minister said on Sunday.China's ZhenHua won a bid to develop the Abu Khaymah oilfield in Iraq's southern Muthanna province, he said.Iraq's main goal with its sixth licensing round was to increase gas output that it wants to use to fire power plants that rely heavily on gas imported from Iran. However, no bids were made on at least two fields with large gas potential, potentially undermining those efforts.Iraq, OPEC's second-largest oil producer behind Saudi Arabia, has been hampered in its oil sector development by contract terms viewed as unfavourable by many major oil companies as well as recurring military conflict in the region and growing investor focus on environmental, social and governance criteria.","Chinese companies ZhenHua and CNOOC Iraq have won bids to explore Iraqi oil and gas fields.
