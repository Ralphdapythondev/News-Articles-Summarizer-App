Stock market today: BSE Sensex sees record closing high; Nifty50 logs longest-ever rally,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/stock-market-today-bse-sensex-nifty50-august-30-2024-dalal-street-indian-equities-q1-gdp-data-global-markets/articleshow/112911939.cms,"Stock market today : India's Nifty 50 index extended its record-breaking rally to a twelfth straight session on Friday, reaching a new all-time high along with the S&P BSE Sensex , driven by expectations of an impending interest rate cut in the United States.The Nifty 50, which debuted in April 1996, advanced 0.33% to close at 25,235.9, while the Sensex gained 0.28% to end at 82,365.77.Both indices recorded their third consecutive weekly and monthly gains, rising 1.6% for the week and approximately 1% in August, according to a Reuters report.Positive U.S. economic indicators throughout the month and accommodative statements from Federal Reserve officials, including Chair Jerome Powell, alleviated growth worries and increased the likelihood of a September rate cut.Analysts anticipate that this will encourage foreign investments in emerging markets, such as Indian equities . Foreign investors became net buyers in the latter half of the month, while domestic investors remained buyers throughout.""Liquidity is coming in left, right and centre, while the near-certainty that the U.S. rate cut will start from September is boosting buying interest and consequently the momentum in markets further,"" said Avinash Gorakshakar, head of research of Profitmart Securities. ""However, the benchmarks may not gallop from here given the high valuations but certainly, the sentiment in Indian markets is as bullish as ever.""IT and pharmaceutical sectors, which derive a significant portion of their revenue from the U.S., were the biggest beneficiaries of the anticipated U.S. rate cut, gaining 4.74% and 6.61%, respectively, in August. The more domestically oriented small- and mid-cap indices rose about 0.9% and 0.5%, respectively, for the month.Crucial U.S. inflation data, scheduled for release later in the day, will provide insight into the probability of a September rate cut. Domestically, data, also due after the market close, is projected to show a slowdown in India's economic growth during the April-June quarter. However, analysts believe this has already been factored in, as the period included the national elections.","The Nifty 50, which debuted in April 1996, advanced 0.33% to close at 25,235.9. S&P BSE Sensex gained 0.28% to end at 82,365.77. Both indices recorded their third consecutive weekly and monthly gains.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112912008,imgsize-113470,width-400,resizemode-4/112912008.jpg"
Market correction will get deposits back to banks: SBI,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/market-correction-will-get-deposits-back-to-banks-sbi/articleshow/112880820.cms,"MUMBAI: SBI managing director Ashwini Tewari on Wednesday said a correction in the equity markets ""over time"" can help banks get back the deposits it has ceded. He also said the country's largest lender is betting on the small-ticket Prime Minister Jan Dhan Yojana accounts to drive deposit growth .Speaking on the sidelines of the GFF, he told reporters that the capital markets' rally has seen a shift of money away from the banks to the higher yielding alternatives.""As the market corrects over time, some of the money that was earlier with us, will come back,"" he said.Interestingly, he said the bank is also looking at the small-ticket deposits from the decade-old PMJDY across its vast network as well to drive its deposit growth. ""(We are focusing) on the small-value, small ticket accounts to raise deposits. Jan Dhan is something we have not focused on (previously), which we will do,"" he said.It can be noted that for nearly 18 months, credit growth has been racing ahead of the deposit growth, forcing lenders to raise rates and compromise margins, and has also led to fears of banks being forced to temper loan growth. markets have witnessed an impressive rally in the last few months and the banking system has been complaining about the shift of funds being one of the reasons for slower deposit growth. agencies","SBI managing director Ashwini Tewari said a correction in the equity markets ""over time"" can help banks get back deposits it has ceded.

The current Banking Regulation Act permits single or joint deposit holders to appoint a nominee for their deposit, items left in the custody of a bank, or a locker hired from a bank.In the event of the nominator's death, the nominee can access the deposit, articles, or locker.According to an ET report, the new Bill suggests allowing up to four nominees for these purposes. For deposits, nominees can be appointed either successively or simultaneously, while for other purposes, they can only be appointed successively.When there are multiple simultaneous nominees, the nomination will be effective in a predetermined proportion. In the case of successive nominations, priority will be given to the nominee named higher in the nomination order.""The Banking Regulation Act allows single or joint deposit holders to appoint a nominee for their deposit. Such a nominee can also be appointed for items left in custody of a bank or for a locker hired from a bank.

For deposits, such nominees can be appointed either successively or simultaneously while for other purposes they can be appointed successively.

Check List Nomination is a crucial aspect of opening lockers and savings accounts in India. The Indian Banks' Association (IBA) says, ""Banking Companies (Nomination) Rules 1985 permits banks to pay dues to nominees in the event of death of depositor(s) without asking for succession certificate or verifying claims of legal heirs. This simplifies settlement. Of course, as Trustee the nominee is accountable to legal heirs.The IBA further clarifies that the nomination facility is available for bank deposits, safe deposit lockers, and safe custody articles. A single deposit account, whether held individually or jointly, can have only one nominee. However, a jointly held locker can have two nominees. In the case of a minor's account, a person legally empowered to operate the account can file a nomination on behalf of the minor.The State Bank of India emphasizes the importance of availing the benefits of nomination facility and survivorship clause for locker-hirers. In the unfortunate event of the death of one of the joint locker-hirers, the contents of the locker do not automatically transfer to the surviving joint locker-hirer or nominee(s) unless there is a survivorship clause or nomination in place.When renting a locker, the bank charges a nominal annual rent based on the size of the locker and the location of the branch. The rent should be paid in advance for the financial year. The bank provides a copy of the signed Locker Agreement to the locker-hirer, outlining their rights and responsibilities.","The Banking Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2024 proposes to increase the number of nominees allowed per bank account and locker from one to four.

Source: ET quoting Paisabazaar for interest rates data as on August 14, 2024.

Highest Fixed Deposit Interest Rates: Fixed deposits (FDs) offered by banks are secure and interest-generating investment options. With FDs, you can expect a guaranteed return on your invested funds, which remain unaffected by market fluctuations. This is the reason that FDs are a go to investment option for most risk averse investors.Interest rates for fixed deposits are near all time highs, with RBI pausing the rate cycle for several monetary policy meetings now.Investors have the flexibility to choose between the re-investment deposit option, which allows for the accumulation of compound interest, or the option to receive interest payments at regular intervals (monthly/quarterly) to support their financial planning and budgeting needs, notes an ET report.The interest rates offered on fixed deposits in August 2024 can vary based on several factors, including the specific bank, the age of the depositor, the tenure of the deposit, and the amount invested.In India, private banks are financial institutions where private companies or individuals hold the majority of the equity, in contrast to public-sector banks where the government is the primary shareholder.Public Sector Undertaking (PSU) banks are ones where the government owns the majority of the shares. These banks receive government subsidies with the aim of facilitating their growth and expansion.For investors interested in comparing fixed deposit interest rates between private and public sector banks, a brief analysis of the fixed deposit rates offered to both general citizens and senior citizens is provided below.","Public Banks: Latest Fixed Deposit Interest Rates For General Citizens.

The airport will undergo a series of test flights starting from September as part of the approval process.The Airport Authority of India (AAI) is expected to conduct calibration flights for the Instrument Landing System (ILS) in September and October, according to an ET report.In December, a commercial airline will operate validation flights for approach and departure procedures without passengers.""Once all these are done and clearance comes, we will apply for the aerodrome license from DGCA and have our first flight by April 2025,"" Schnellmann said.The commencement of commercial operations was initially planned for September, but a supply chain issue that affected the import of specialized steel used in constructing the airport terminal building's roof has caused a delay in the process.Zurich Airport , which won the bid to build the airport 18 years after it was first envisioned by then Uttar Pradesh chief minister Rajnath Singh, owns the airport. In 2022, NIAL selected Tata Projects for the construction work.Schnellmann mentioned that the airport is garnering significant interest from both domestic and international airlines. The NIA is currently in discussions with Air India and other carriers for flight operations from the airport, which will serve as the second major airport in the National Capital Region after Delhi's Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGIA).The Noida International Airport's terminal is being designed to handle both domestic and international operations in an integrated manner.In its initial phase, the airport will feature a single runway and terminal, capable of accommodating 1.2 crore passengers annually. Upon completion of the fourth phase, the airport's capacity will expand to handle 70 million passengers per year.Several airlines, including IndiGo and Akasa Air, have already signed agreements with the Noida International Airport.According to airport officials, the majority of the runway construction work has been completed.The first phase of the airport will include one terminal, one runway, 10 aerobridges, and 25 parking stands.To ensure seamless connectivity, the airport will be accessible through six roads, a rapid rail-cum-metro system, and pod taxis. Additionally, a 31-kilometre greenfield expressway is under construction to connect the airport with the Delhi-Mumbai Expressway at Ballabhgarh.The Uttar Pradesh government has approved a Rs 16,000-crore rapid rail corridor that will link the two airports and other parts of Delhi.

""Although agriculture growth in real terms was 2% in the first quarter, going forward, given the fact that there are very few deficit monsoon divisions, sowing of pulses and cereals is higher and the reservoir storage is higher than last year and 10-year average, agriculture will see a rebound in growth as we head further into the financial year.""He also drew comfort from ""very steady expansionary phase"" in manufacturing and an upbeat services sector.Nageswaran pointed to strong demand for passenger vehicles, airlines as well as two-wheelers and tractors to argue that urban and rural consumption was steady. The govt economist further argued that the fear of food inflation spilling into other segments was not borne out by data and inflation expectations remained below last year's level.At the same time, he warned of possible risks including electoral outcomes in several countries impacting global trade and investment. ""Escalation of geopolitical conflicts may lead to supply dislocations, higher commodity prices, reviving inflationary pressures and stalling monetary policy easing with potential repercussions for capital flows,"" he added.Potential corrections in financial markets too could impact household finances and corporate valuations.",India's growth momentum remains strong with Asia's third-largest economy expected to expand 6.5-7% this year.

Why it’s time to explore bold & path-breaking alternatives that put Indian Railways on a smooth track,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-its-time-to-explore-bold-path-breaking-alternatives-that-put-indian-railways-on-a-smooth-track/articleshow/112317406.cms,"By Ashutosh Bhandari

Railway Budget 2024 : The government has wavered little in its efforts to spur a modernisation of railways in the country, pivoting on technology, to support the country’s economic ambitions. In line with expectations, Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore, marking yet another year of successive increase in outlay.That takes forward the past policies and the government’s vision, which have paved the way for modernisation of the transport behemoth.In earlier decades, the government had focused on laying tracks on new routes, electrification and incremental rolling stock capacity addition. That was the need of the hour back then and has helped set up the base for a larger transformation.For instance, the massive Dedicated Freight Corridor ( DFC ) as well as locomotive factories at Marhaura and Madhepura in Bihar were conceptualised over a decade ago and we are seeing their completion now.More recently, the focus has shifted to modernisation—of rolling stock and safety systems, among other aspects.This year, emphasis has also been laid on the railways’ crucial role in industrial development. Commodity-specific corridors have been planned in eastern India and impetus given to port connectivity. Vande Bharat and technology-led upgrades in rolling stock remain in focus. Safety has been prioritised through budgetary allocations for the anti-collision systemKavach . That said, there are other cogs in the wheel that demand attention from a long-term perspective.First, the target for the Operating Ratio, the crucial efficiency gauge, has been set at 98.22% for 2024-25, compared with 98.65% in 2023-24. This reflects an imminent need for operational transformation. An effective overhaul of the world’s fourth-largest rail network will take many years and thus we need to start focusing on improving efficiency and reducing costs now.DFC is almost entirely operational and will be complete over the next few months. To ensure the project achieves its twin goals of reducing logistics costs and enhancing freight efficiency, railways need to attract more cargo on the corridor. This will help increase the rail coefficient and make the railways’ approach more market-oriented, which will in turn aid future corridors.A revamp of railway stations is on track, with sufficient funds dedicated to this end. But even though new coaches and wagons are increasingly being added to meet footfalls, the stations and passenger trains themselves remain synonymous with chaos.Just as safety, comfort and convenience have been prioritised, there is a need for solutions to address the capacity and demand challenges. As a first step, the government could target development of new stations and setting up of new coach production units.As a leading freight mover, Indian Railways carried a record 1,588 MT cargo in fiscal 2024, up from 1,095 MT in fiscal 2015. It accounts for 26% of the cargo moved in the country—by no means an easy feat. The railways aims to take this volume to 3,000 MT by 2030, which would require a 11% CAGR against the around 4.2% witnessed over the last 10 years. As per a report by TERI and Shakti Foundation, from carrying about 62% of freight traffic in 1990-91, Indian Railways’ share has declined to ~27% in 2014-15. This has been due to the expanding road network, cost competitiveness over railways, and door-to-door service. Thus, commencing the cycle of increasing the rail share again is commendable.DFCs, a high-capacity track network, high-power locomotives and improvement in wagon designs have set the ball rolling for larger capacity, faster freight trains that deliver better efficiency.Yet, achieving exponential growth is a tall ask given the current dynamics. Possibly, similar challenges might apply to other goals the railways might have for 2047.To be fair, despite its scale and complexity, Indian Railways has been able to achieve diverse developments at commendable speed.But the track ahead is long and it is time to start discussing the reinvention of the institutional set-up.Indian Railways sees substantial private sector involvement in the form of vendors and contractors. Policymakers could start mulling extreme options such as parallel privately-owned and operated railway infrastructure, coupled with centralised planning and an evolved role for the railways. This will need a robust policy framework from the Government of India.The time is perhaps also ripe to bring user charge and asset monetisation-driven segments for passengers as well as cargo to the discussion table. Globally, the separation of infrastructure and operations in railways has delivered mixed results, for example in the United Kingdom. The model should be analysed and revisited to understand its potential relevance in the Indian context.The key would be to retrace our steps and align our long-term goals to identify not just incremental changes but also ways to explore bold and path-breaking alternatives that put Indian Railways on a smooth track and bring it up to speed.","Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore.

Budget 2024 capital gains tax changes: The Narendra Modi government is considering suggestions for tweaks in the new long term capital gains tax regime that was announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman in Union Budget 2024.The July 23 budget reduced the LTCG tax on property from 20% to 12.5%. The indexation benefit, which allowed taxpayers to adjust the acquisition cost for inflation before calculating capital gains and thus reduce their tax liability, is proposed to be eliminated for properties purchased on or after April 1, 2001.The government publishes the Cost Inflation Index (CII) annually for this calculation.India Inc is appealing to the government for a gradual shift to the long-term capital gains tax regime proposed in the FY25 budget, which aims to eliminate indexation benefits for property, gold, and other unlisted assets.According to an ET report by Deepshikha Sikarwar, the industry is suggesting alternatives such as a higher tax rate with indexation or a lower rate of 12.5% without indexation, as well as some form of grandfathering for ancestral properties.The finance ministry is currently reviewing these proposals and will discuss them with the Prime Minister's Office. The final decision will be made closer to the date when the Finance Bill reply is to be presented in Parliament, the reports said.Industry groups are expected to submit formal proposals to the finance ministry in the near future.

Budget 2024 for manufacturing sector : The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth. While the middle class has been offered tax relief, the government's primary focus remains on judicious spending to maximize economic impact. The budget's core themes are employment, skilling, MSME development, and support for the middle class.Largely focus has remained intact on spending money judiciously to ensure that each penny spent creates a ripple effect in the entire economic landscape.Although at first glance, manufacturing might appear to have taken a backseat, a deeper analysis reveals a multifaceted approach to bolstering the sector. Initiatives like employment-linked benefits and internship programs, while primarily aimed at job creation and skill development, indirectly benefit manufacturing companies by expanding the talent pool.Extensive focus on the MSME manufacturing units by way of extending term loan facility for purchase of machinery and equipment without collateral or third-party guarantee, would help companies in augmenting their capital base/ capacity and strengthen the very foundation of the manufacturing ecosystem in the country. Development of a new credit-assessment model by Public Sector Banks to assess MSME credit shall provide much needed regulatory relief to the units.With respect to the large manufacturing entities, while there is no direct fiscal/ tax incentive introduced in this budget, some support has been provided with an extensive focus on development of ‘industrial parks’ in nearly 100 cities under the ‘plug and play’ model. Reforms proposed with respect to land administration, planning and management, shall also ease out acquisition related difficulties often faced by entrepreneurs/ business houses in acquiring lands for manufacturing set-ups.Targeted Customs duty interventions like, rationalization of Customs duty provisions in Mobile phone manufacturing setups, extension of Customs duty exemption on import of capital goods for manufacturing of solar cells and panels, full Customs duty exemption on import of 25 critical minerals,, shall provide the required impetus for enhancing domestic manufacturing environment.Governments’ focus on formulating an Economic Policy Framework to set the scope for next-gen reforms in the country, has a target to improve the productivity of factors of production, namely, land, labour, capital, entrepreneurship and technology. This shall pave the way for enabling achievement of a target of 25% manufacturing sector contribution to the nation’s GDP over the course of next 7-10 years.While the overall outlook is positive, the extension of tax benefits under Section 115BAB for manufacturing entities and the absence of new PLI schemes are notable omissions.The country’s manufacturing base is expanding as is reflective from the continuously increasing tax collections and expanding Purchasing Manager’s Index. It would be pertinent to see how the ground realities evolve vis-à-vis the vision envisaged, in the upcoming Financial Year.","The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth.

Budget 2024: Armed with the vision to propel India to become a developed country by 2047, the Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business thereby providing the required stimulus to the manufacturing sector and enabling large scale job creation.On the Indirect tax front, the industry welcomes the much-needed announcement for a comprehensive review of the rate structure under Customs enabling ease in product classification and dispute reduction. The proposal of lowering of Customs duty on a plethora of raw materials and products including solar cells, critical minerals and bullion are encouraging measures. The rationale behind such reduction clearly indicates support towards domestic manufacturing, deepening value addition and supporting targets in reducing carbon footprint.Relevant amendments under the Customs law have been made to provide increased time limits for re-imports and re-exports to enhance competitiveness of the fledgling MRO sector. The government has extended significant duty reduction and exemption benefits to the healthcare and electronics sectors, continuing the impetus of incentives provided under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme.Since their introduction in March 2020, the PLI schemes have indeed supported in revitalizing the manufacturing sector and strengthening the necessary supply chains. The success achieved in the mobile manufacturing sector has now enabled the Government to reduce customs duties on mobile phones and components, signalling a mature environment. The Budget proposals aim at reproducing similar outcomes for semiconductor and pharmaceutical industry by increasing the budgetary allocation.Buoyed by the increasing revenue collection under GST signalling a shift towards a mature tax regime, this Budget has harmonized the timeframes for the issuance of demand notices and adjudication orders for cases involving fraud, suppression or otherwise. Significant amendments to the GST legislations have been introduced reflecting the recommendations proposed by the GST Council such as regularizing non-levy of GST due to general practice which may turn out to be a breather for certain impacted industries reeling under huge tax demands.The Insurance sector has been provided much relief through the GST council recommendations which have been cemented in the present budget thereby ending long standing disputes on their business practices.The Government's efforts to push forward with its reform agenda are evident as plans to incentivize states for their business reform actions plans and digitalization through the Jan Vishwas Bill 2.0 is proposed. Further, setting up of e-commerce export hubs is envisaged to facilitate easier access to international markets for domestic players.The recent implementation of Budget proposals allows the government to maintain momentum in its reform agenda. These policy measures implicitly reaffirm the significance of India Inc as a crucial element in the development of infrastructure. However, there are still some expectations required to be met to march towards a Viksit Bharat 2047.",The Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business.

Budget 2024 : Real estate, a significant contributor to employment generation, has received a fair bit of attention in Budget 2024-25. Recent years have seen the sector transform rapidly, driven by factors such as favourable government policies, Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, strong economic growth and changing consumer preferences.Added to that, the budgetary focus on job creation, skilling and employment-linked incentives, infrastructure, urban development, rural connectivity, digitalisation and land-related norms, all dovetail to promote growth of the sector.Launched in June 2015, the PMAY aims to provide affordable housing to all eligible beneficiaries. The budget unveiled PMAY Urban 2.0, under which the housing needs of 1 crore urban poor and middle class will be addressed with an investment of Rs 10 lakh crore.The central government’s additional Rs 2.2 lakh crore injection in the next 5 years to make housing more affordable has the potential to revitalise the affordable housing market.Such an approach can play an important role in realising the government's vision of Housing for All and push growth and development. Hence, the significant investment under PMAY Urban 2.0 is expected to alleviate urban housing deficits, spurring construction and economic growth.Steps to introduce technological reforms within the regulatory framework for land, such as digitalisation or GIS mapping of land records, will improve transparency.Rationalisation of stamp duty across states will also be critical to bring in uniformity and initiate land-related reforms such as urban planning, usage and building bylaws.These are steps in the right direction and will boost growth. Moreover, they will improve the ease of property transactions and strengthen municipal finances through increased property taxes. Rationalization of stamp duty with an emphasis on women homebuyers may boost home-buyer sentiment in major cities, too.The budget has also given ample attention to urban and rural development, with rental housing for industrial workers through the public private partnership model, interest subsidies for rental housing, and transit-oriented developments.The proposal to develop investment-ready plug-and-play industrial parks in 100 cities may attract industrial investment, leading to increased demand for industrial real estate and support the growth of ancillary services and residential developments in these regions.Initiatives for industrial parks and rental housing for industrial workers align with the country’s manufacturing goals and addresses worker accommodation needs.These steps are expected to promote industrial growth and stability in labour-intensive sectors, while also creating new opportunities for real estate developers specialising in rental and affordable housing.The changes in long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax, however, have evoked a mixed reaction. The government lowered the long-term capital gains tax from 20% to 12.5%, which is a welcome step. However, this came with the removal of the indexation benefit.The changes could encourage more liquidity in property transactions and potentially increase the effective tax burden depending on the property’s acquisition date.The launch of Phase IV of the PM Gram Sadak Yojana in 25,000 rural habitations will improve connectivity in rural areas, promoting rural development and making these regions more accessible for investment. The primary objective of PMGSY is to build robust, all-weather roads in rural habitations. This initiative focuses on enhancing connectivity and supporting economic development in rural areas.In essence, the budget is geared towards stimulating growth and investment in the real estate sector , fostering a more transparent and investor-friendly environment, and contributing to overall development. It aims to create a balanced and inclusive growth environment by addressing the needs of various segments, including affordable housing, industrial workers and urban infrastructure.The effectiveness of the initiatives, however, hinges on their implementation and continued support of complementary reforms.","Budget 2024-25 is geared towards stimulating growth and investment in the real estate sector.

New Budget 2024 rule: Why Income Tax Department is likely to issue a huge number of tax notices this month,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-budget-2024-rule-why-income-tax-department-is-likely-to-issue-a-huge-number-of-tax-notices-this-month/articleshow/112186079.cms,"Taxing Times

Income Tax Notice on the way? The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month, as there are concerns that many taxpayers might escape the tax net due to the impending implementation of the new reassessment law on September 1, 2024.According to the amended regulation announced in Budget 2024 , the tax authorities can only go back a maximum of five years to reassess a taxpayer's records if the escaped income is at least Rs 50 lakh, and three years for an amount less than Rs 50 lakh.Previously, they could reassess cases up to 10 years old.According to an ET report, tax officials are now faced with the challenge of compiling and corroborating data on tax and income mismatches for the financial years 2013-14 to 2017-18 within the next few weeks, as these years will become time-barred for reassessment from September 1, 2024.The I-T department relies on information from various sources, such as banks, property registrars, and search findings from the investigation wing, to build reassessment cases.A tax officers' body has raised concerns about the feasibility of issuing notices under Section 148 (or 148A) in a large number of cases within a single month, given the overburdened nature of the jurisdictional assessing officers and the time-consuming process of obtaining sanction from the chief commissioner, who is the specified authority for such notices.Moreover, the law provides taxpayers with the right to explain their position before reassessment orders are finalized, a process that most believe cannot be completed by the end of August.Also Read | ITR refund status for FY 2023-24: How to check income tax refund status online - here’s a step-by-step guide for incometax.gov.in & NSDL websites The Central Board of Direct Taxes ( CBDT ) has been urged by its officers to postpone the effective date of the proposed amendment. However, this suggestion is unlikely to be well-received by corporations and high net worth individuals.""Capping the reassessment period at five years was a great decision as it would reduce hassles and litigation. But if the department fears there could be a genuine loss of revenue as it may not be possible to wrap up several matters by August 31, the government can think of strict parameters where time-bound cases can be selectively reopened - based on trails of steps taken in identifying escaped income,"" said Mitil Chokshi, partner at CA firm Chokshi & Chokshi.""Taxpayers may expect a rush of reassessment notices in August 2024. These notices are likely to be for the AYs 2018-19 and prior to that. It is pertinent to note that the Bombay High Court in a recent ruling in a case of Hexaware Technologies has taken a view on a proviso introduced in 2021, which can be interpreted to mean that AY 2017-18 (and prior years) got time barred on March 31, 2024. These reassessment notices (for AYs 2017-18 and prior) are likely to rake up new interpretation issues in the already muddled reassessment provisions,"" said Ashish Mehta, partner at law firm Khaitan & Co.The current situation is similar to the conflict between the Income Tax office and taxpayers in 2021. The reassessment law was amended in April 2021, allowing the tax office to reopen 10-year-old tax returns if the total undisclosed income exceeded Rs 50 lakh and reassess 4-year-old matters if the amount was less than Rs 50 lakh.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? However, this change led to over 10,000 writ petitions being filed by companies, arguing that they were not given sufficient time to explain and that the notices were issued without considering the carve-out that cases which couldn't be reopened earlier couldn't be reassessed under the new law.The Supreme Court invoked its extraordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution on May 4, 2022, to uphold all reassessment notices issued after March 31, 2021. However, the court left room for judicial proceedings based on the merits of each case, and several such matters are currently pending before the court.","The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month.

In 2004, the capex allocation of UPA’s first Budget was Rs 90,000 crore. This increased to only Rs 2 lakh crore in the last UPA budget in 2014, Modi said. At present the capex allocation is over Rs 11 lakh crore, Modi added. Modi pointed out that the capex allocation of railways and highways has become 8 times under his government.PM Modi said that India, which is currently the world’s fifth largest economy, will soon become the third largest.

Are NPS Vatsalya & hiked NPS deduction limit for private sector employees good moves from Budget 2024?

NPS and EPF: Overlapping services

What is NPS Vatsalaya?

Latest NPS rules, news: In the Union Budget 2024 speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced two new initiatives with regard to National Pension Scheme (NPS) - extension of NPS 14% employer contribution benefits to private setcor and the intended launch of NPS Vatsalya.Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries, bringing it at par with the provisions available for government employees.Sriram Iyer, CEO, HDFC Pension Management told ET that with this move the “ground rules have been harmonised among government and non-government employees, which is a positive step.”Effectively, this means that now, private-sector employees can choose to reduce the taxable portion of employers’ contribution to their NPS corpus, thereby paying less tax and leaving greater funds in their pension deposits.“Employees will benefit from tax savings . More importantly, the 40% increase in contribution will have a significant impact on the terminal value of the retirement corpus,” remarked Iyer. The extended savings will “help in retirement planning, working as an option that is at par with the Provident Fund,” Dinesh Rohira, CEO & Founder, 5nance.com was quoted as saying.Moreover, the endeavour aims to increase NPS penetration by increasing tax incentives for the private sector, providing them a social security-cushion post-retirement.The scheme’s motive to widen the NPS subscriber base may not prove to be flawlessly effective, however. This is explained by Agrees Mrin Agarwal, Founder, Finsafe India: “While it’s good that the limit has been raised, it may not increase adoption as employees need to be educated in a big way. Also, the benefit is only for the salaried opting for the new tax regime,” she says.The mandatory contribution to the EPF, too, threatens to relegate the provisions of NPS under the umbrella of near-superfluity. This sentiment is echoed by Varun Sahay, a software engineer in a Delhi-based IT company: “When 12% of my salary is already deducted for the EPF, why should I put in more in the NPS and cut my take-home pay?”Rohira feels otherwise. “There’s no competition between the NPS and EPF as employees can contribute to both and build a 3-4 times bigger corpus while earning 3-4% higher returns via marketlinked options in the NPS,” he counters.Also Check | New Tax Regime 2023 vs 2024 After Budget: How Much Income Tax Will Salaried Taxpayers Save & How Do New Tax Slabs Compare To Old Regime? Top 10 Points You Must Know To jumpstart retirement savings for children, a new initiative called NPS Vatsalya has been unveiled in the Budget. This scheme allows parents and guardians to contribute to a minor's account, which can be converted into a regular NPS account once the child reaches adulthood.""It provides a very long duration for reaping the compounding benefits and accumulating a huge bounty at a later age. This can be a good way to plan a better future for kids who may not opt for a service segment in the future,"" says Rohira. Sriram Iyer agrees, stating, ""It’s a good move to help the child start his retirement journey. Even if a parent starts when the child is 10 years old, by the time he starts working, it can be a solid foundation for the compounding journey after that.""However, some experts question the utility of a product with such a long lock-in period, especially when parents cannot use the funds for essential goals like their child’s education amidst soaring education costs of 11-12%.""Parents are struggling to save for their own retirement, so it might be a bit of a stretch to expect them to save for their kids’ retirement. The need of the hour is a market-linked product that allows withdrawals only for the child’s education,"" says Mrin Agarwal, Founder of Finsafe India.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? Though the NPS permits partial withdrawals, it allows only 25% of the corpus after three years of joining, and this can be done only three times during the entire tenure. A premature exit before 60 years with 100% withdrawal is only possible if the corpus is less than Rs.2.5 lakh, an amount insufficient for most children's goals.""In its current form, there won’t be any uptake,"" asserts Agarwal. Rohira concurs, ""It’s a vanilla product with a lock-in, which does not make it very attractive and it may not take off. However, the government may optimise it and introduce new features later."" Iyer adds, ""This is just a start and there may be more subscriber-friendly features as we take it to the market. The regulator is proactive and open to feedback.""","Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries.

Gold import duty cut: Why Indians may not find buying gold from Dubai as attractive post Budget 2024,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-import-duty-cut-why-indians-may-not-find-buying-gold-from-dubai-as-attractive-post-budget-2024/articleshow/112097671.cms,"Gold import duty cut in Budget 2024: The recent reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai. Indian jewellers with stores in both India and the UAE believe that the narrowed duty differential will result in lower gold prices in India, making it less attractive for Indians to purchase gold in Dubai.The emirate had attracted gold-enthusiast Indians following a steep rise in customs duty in India in July 2022. In the fiscal 2024-25 budget, the duty on gold imports was more than halved.The duty cut is also expected to boost gold jewellery production in India, particularly the popular 'Kolkatti' jewellery from Kolkata, which is favored by Indian expats in Dubai and tourists from various countries. This move will encourage gold artisans to create new designs in both heavyweight and lightweight jewellery, attracting consumers to purchase gold from India.According to an ET report, Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group , estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India as Indian tourists who previously bought jewellery in Dubai will now prefer to shop in India. However, Indian expats living in Dubai and other customers may continue to buy from the UAE.Also Read | Gold losing sheen? Government cuts gold bond issuance target as investors look at better alternatives Rajiv Popley, director at Popley & Sons, believes that the perception of overseas gold being cheaper than in India is merely a mindset. He points out that the labour cost is significantly lower in India, and with the introduction of mandatory hallmarking and HUID numbers, the purity of gold in India is no longer a concern.Furthermore, NRIs in Dubai do not receive VAT refunds, and Indians travelling abroad only receive about 60% of the VAT back on their gold purchases. Gold trade analyst Bhargav Baidya suggests that the 1% duty differential between gold jewellery in India and Dubai will be offset by Indian jewellers offering discounts to retain and attract customers.Saurabh Gadgil, chairman of PNG Jewellers, notes that Indian import duty is now on par with the US, allowing Indian jewellers to offer competitive prices compared to other countries worldwide. The reduced customs duty is expected to make gold purchases in India more attractive and convenient for Indian consumers, potentially leading to a significant shift in their gold shopping preferences.",The reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai.

Gold losing sheen? The government has reduced its target for issuing gold bonds in the financial year 2024-25 by 38% compared to the previous interim budget goal, according to a senior official. The revised target stands at Rs 18,500 crore, down from Rs 29,638 crore estimated in the interim budget and Rs 26,852 crore (revised estimate) in 2023-24.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told ET ""The decision followed a reassessment of various factors, including investor demand, other investment products and uncertainties around the global economy, as the situation has changed since the interim budget in February.""After accounting for redemptions, the net issuances of sovereign gold bonds are now estimated at Rs 15,000 crore for this fiscal year, a significant decrease from the Rs 26,138 crore projected in the interim budget and Rs 25,352 crore in the revised estimate for 2023-24.Harish Galipelli, director at ILA Commodities India, attributed this shift to retail investors increasingly opting for equities in anticipation of better returns. He also noted that people are uncertain about the potential for further increases in gold prices in the short-to-medium term following a recent rally. Additionally, Galipelli pointed out that savings in rural areas have been impacted by retail inflation and other factors.The gold bond and gold monetisation schemes were introduced by the government in late 2015 to discourage the physical purchase of precious metals and reduce imports, thereby mitigating the negative impact on the current account deficit.The gross collection through these two schemes is now projected to be Rs 20,030 crore in 2024-25, compared to Rs 31,168 crore in the interim budget and Rs 28,240 crore (revised estimate) in the previous fiscal year. Similarly, the net collection is estimated at Rs 16,433 crore, down from Rs 27,571 crore in the interim budget and Rs 26,653 crore in the previous year.

Both schemes were designed to curb gold imports, which, along with crude oil, have been significant contributors to India's current account deficit.

The new target is set to replace wealthy nations' current commitment to provide 100 billion dollars every year in climate finance to developing countries.A far larger goal than 100 billion dollars is needed by the vulnerable and developing countries. Donor countries such as the 27 nation EU and Canada state that stretching national budgets would make it unrealistic to increase their public funding.The COP29 summit will be held in Azerbaijan in November.One option in the document reflects the stance of Arab countries, aiming for the developed countries to provide 441 billion Dollars each year in grants, combined to accumulate a total 1.1 trillion dollars in funding from all sources, including private finance, each year from 2025 to 2029.Another option reflects the EU's negotiating perspective by setting a global climate funding target of more than 1 trillion Dollars each year, including countries' domestic investments and private funding, which would also include a lesser amount provided by countries ""with high greenhouse gas emissions and economic capabilities"".The EU has demanded that China, which is the world's biggest polluter and biggest economy today, should contribute to the new climate funding goal.Under a system that was developed in the 1990s, China is categorized as a developing country by the UN. However, the idea that it should be on the hook to pay climate finance is rejected by Beijing.Negotiators expect that the issue of who should contribute is becoming one of the biggest hurdles to agreeing a finance deal at COP29.Another option in the document, supporting Canada's position, suggests to change the list of the contributors to the target.

Japan's defense ministry seeks record budget as it faces growing threat from China,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/japans-defense-ministry-seeks-record-budget-as-it-faces-growing-threat-from-china/articleshow/112924861.cms,"TOKYO: Japan 's Defense Ministry Friday sought a record 8.5 trillion yen ( Dollar 59 billion) budget for the next year to fortify its deterrence on southwestern islands against China's increasing threat, while focusing on unmanned weapons and AI to make up for the declining number of servicemembers as a result of the country's shrinking population.The ministry's request for 2025 marks the third year of Japan's rapid five-year military buildup plan under the government's ongoing security strategy.Japan aims to spend 43 trillion yen ( Dollar 297 billion) through 2027 to double its annual military spending to around 10 trillion yen, making it the world's third-largest military spender after the United States and China.The budget request was approved at the Defense Ministry meeting Friday ahead of a submission to the Finance Ministry for negotiations through December.Japan has been rapidly building up the defense of the southwestern region in recent years amid China's growing military threats and tension in the regional seas.China has escalated clashes with the Philippine coast guards in disputed waters in the South China Sea and sent a fleet of coast guard boats to routinely violate territorial waters around Japanese-controlled disputed islands in the East China Sea that Beijing also claims.A hefty 970 billion yen ( Dollar 6.7 billion) of the budget request for 2025 covers the cost of bolstering strike-back capability with the development and purchases of long-range missiles and equipment for their launch, including from an Aegis-class destroyer. About one-third of it goes to a satellite constellation aimed at bolstering the capability to detect missile-related activity, as North Korea, China and Russia develop hypersonic missiles that are harder to detect and track.While pushing military buildup, Japan must deal with a shrinking troop size and is focusing on developing and buying more drones for surveillance and combat, requesting 103 billion yen ( Dollar 710 million). It also seeks 314 billion yen ( Dollar 2.17 billion) to build three new multi-purpose compact destroyers that require 90 crewmembers, less than half the crew size currently needed.Japanese defense officials say combat drones are ""game changers"" that can be on hours-long missions and lower human losses in combat and consider it a main pillar of Japan's ongoing military buildup. The unmanned weapons can also help a country struggling with its aging and shrinking population.Japan has been struggling to fulfill SDF troop levels at 247,000 people.The Self-Defense Force has faced difficulty attracting young applicants in recent years and fulfilled only half of its recruiting target of 19,598 last year, making it the lowest in the 70 years of SDF history. Last year, 6,258 mid-career personnel left, the highest number in 30 years.""Due to declining childbirths and working age population, it is inevitable that Japan will face a society of serious labor shortage,"" the ministry said in an interim report on human resources, also released Friday. ""We need to build an organization that can fight in new ways while strengthening defense power.""Shrinking younger population and private companies that offer better salaries and benefits make ""the environment surrounding recruiting servicemembers the worst since the end of World War II,"" the ministry report said.It requested 18 billion yen ( Dollar 124 million) to introduce an AI surveillance system at 40 SDF bases across Japan, aiming to free up 1,000 service personnel. It is also asking 4.3 billion ( Dollar 29.7 million) for automated supply storage for launch in 2027 in Okinawa.In the interim report released Friday, the ministry called for reforms to improve salary, working environment, more training and learning opportunities, as well as support for working mothers to lure more women.The ministry has been hit by a series of revelations of sexual assaults, harassment and abuse of power in recent years. Its internal investigation last year criticized cover-up attempts and a lack of sense of responsibility among supervisors. It came under fire in July over the leak of classified information and corruption scandals.",Japan's Defense Ministry seeks record 8.5 trillion yen ( Dollar 59 billion) budget for the next year.

This data does not include foreign domestic helpers, highlighting a broader trend of economic pressure on local residents.A study released by the UK-based consultancy WTW revealed that nearly 40 percent of Hong Kong companies have reduced their payroll budgets for the financial year ending in March, a substantial increase from the 21 percent reported a year earlier. This reduction is indicative of widespread financial caution among businesses in the region, reported SCMP.Additionally, a survey conducted in May by the Hong Kong Small and Medium Enterprises Association and Junior Chamber International Hong Kong found that 70 percent of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) reported business levels falling below pre-pandemic norms.This underscores the ongoing difficulties faced by the SME sector, which has struggled to recover fully from the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.The official statistics also showed that while the labour force grew by 8,900 to 3,474,400, unemployment surged to 114,700 in the second quarter, an increase of 3,000 from the previous quarter. The construction, retail, accommodation, and food services sectors were hit hardest, with unemployment rates in these sectors significantly surpassing the overall average rate of 3 percent.Furthermore, the number of underemployed residents increased by 4,500, reaching 44,500 during the same period. Underemployment, where individuals are working fewer hours than desired, reflects the broader issue of economic instability, as reported by SCMP.The city has seen a wave of closures across various sectors, including shops, restaurants, and cinemas, contributing to the economic downturn. In response to these challenges, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority recently established a task force to support small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) struggling with loan repayments.Chief Executive John Lee Ka-Chiu acknowledged the economic difficulties but expressed a positive outlook, stating that the transition of old businesses being replaced by new ones is a normal economic process. He projected that the economy could see improvements in the coming year.The economic challenges in Hong Kong reflect a complex interplay of local and global factors, including the ongoing effects of the pandemic and broader economic uncertainties.",Hong Kong's economic situation has seen a notable downturn in the second quarter of this year.

SHANGHAI: Chinese exporters have amassed a US dollar hoard estimated at about $500 billion, which could turbocharge the already rallying yuan if those businesses start buying the Chinese currency, analysts said.Non-financial corporate foreign exchange (FX) deposits hit USD 431.7 billion in July, according to central bank data, while a Barclays estimate derived from FX settlement and transaction data put Chinese companies' total dollar holdings at about USD 500 billion.Goldman Sachs estimates, based on FX conversion ratios, suggest an increase of about USD 700 billion in ""excess"" FX holdings by Chinese firms since 2020.Even a partial reversal of such a large position can move the market and momentum is in the yuan's favour.

Currently, Kakao accounts for 90 percent of the market.Because of local regulations, the joint venture matches riders only with licensed taxis, not with casual Uber drivers, as in many other markets.Initially, the joint venture did not make significant inroads, but after a rebrand in March, Uber has ""observed month-on-month double-digit growth, with an increase in both ridership and driver participation enhancing the reliability of the service"", CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said.""In Korea usage by international travellers has more than doubled after the rebrand,"" he added. ""In fact, most Uber taxis in Korea now arrive within three minutes of being ordered.""Khosrowshahi said South Korea ""is a very attractive market but at the same time, the Korean market is very different and Western companies have had difficulty penetrating the Korean market which is one of the reasons why we have local partnerships.""""We have a lot of respect for local regulators here and we believe that we can build a business in collaboration with local regulations as they are.""Last month, media reports said Kakao Taxi was being investigated for potentially unfair contracts that impose fees on bookings through other apps like Uber Taxi.Domestic taxi drivers have long expressed dissatisfaction with the Kakao app's hefty commission rates, which they argue disadvantage them, yet they continue to use the platform because of its significant market presence.","Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi says the company is seeing double-digit growth in South Korea.

sThe crypto market is on the verge of another bull cycle. While top altcoins are preparing for positive price corrections, some are set to explode. These are the three cryptocurrencies ready for wild pumps this season.1. Crypto All Stars – Raining passive income in $STARSCrypto All-Stars ($STARS) is the latest meme coin to whip up a buying frenzy in the meme coin market.Interestingly, it is not a conventional meme coin. There is no pet breed mascot or quirky backstory that embellishes the project.Yet, meme coin investors are scrambling to secure $STARS tokens in the ongoing presale at low prices and high staking APYs. Why is $STARS topping the charts?Crypto All-Stars is a new crypto project that gives an investor deep exposure to the meme coin market. To make this possible, it launches a unified staking protocol that supports multi-token staking across different blockchains. The interoperable staking dashboard is called MemeVault .It brings top meme coins under one umbrella to not just simplify portfolio management, but also boost passive income from meme coins. In other words, the project rides the meme coin wave while nurturing a rapidly expanding community. It inspires the meme coin community to think beyond a pet-themed mascot and a catchy storyline.MemeVault makes it easier than ever for investors to reap rewards from their meme coin holdings. It saves the time and effort that go into juggling different staking platforms. Here, investors just need to deposit their meme coins into MemeVault and watch the rewards roll in.The returns are paid in $STARS tokens, the native crypto. $STARS holdings can potentially triple the returns from MemeVault. Clearly, the $STARS presale is attracting attention for valid reasons.A growing number of crypto influencers and analysts have been sharing bullish sentiments about $STARS, fuelling the surrounding hype. According to 99Bitcoins, $STARS is set to become a crypto gem.99Bitcoins is a top crypto educational YouTube channel with over 700K subscribers. The ongoing $STARS presale supports crypto and fiat purchases.2. Pepe Unchained – Top crypto with long-term and short-term price potentialPepe Unchained ($PEPU) is one of the most interesting new projects of 2024. On the outside, PEPU is another meme coin with a quirky account.“Pepe was trapped, confined to his clunky Layer 1 server room. But the story doesn't end there. With a stroke of Giga Brain genius, Pepe devised a plan to break free from his chains and embrace the future with PEPE Unchained,” reads the white paper.On a closer look, Pepe Unchained is a utility coin backed by a layer 2 solution. When platforms like Polygon and Optimism are already doing a good job at reducing network congestion, why do we need Pepe Unchained?The answer: Pepe Unchained is dedicated to meme coins. It narrows down its niche to the highly slippery crypto sector, which deserves its own specialised approach. In this volatile landscape, speed and efficiency can make or break a portfolio.Pepe Unchained comes with quicker transactions and lower fees. The layer-2 blockchain is suited for the chaotic meme coins.Pepe Unchained ($PEPU) hasn’t hit exchanges yet. However, the community has already grown to 11.2K followers on Twitter and nearly 6K on Telegram. The new meme coin is stirring up a crypto storm if the presale progress is any indication.With the presale passing the $11 million mark, investors are flocking to hoard $PEPU before it makes its exchange debut. The first series of exchange listings are expected to align with the next bull cycle, strengthening the initial momentum.The vibrant community could be the next big force in the new altcoin sector. Early $PEPU investors are also eligible for high staking rewards. At the time of writing, the staking APY (annual percentage yield) stood at 200%. 780 million $PEPU tokens have already been staked.As the presale enters the final stages, the staking APY will decline and the selling price will increase. In other words, early investors secure the best presale deals.3. Shiba Shootout – Top crypto to buy now in the play-to-earn sectorShiba Shootout ($SHIBASHOOT) is next on the list. The meme coin has embraced a thrilling play-to-earn utility to substantiate its long-term relevance. It is one of the few projects that cleverly combine the allure of meme coin excitement with practical utility.The $SHIBASHOOT presale is fast approaching the $1 million mark. As one of 2024's crypto offerings, the token launch is highly anticipated. Investors get attractive staking rewards starting from the presale stage.The project’s key strength is its play-to-earn gaming mechanics. Gunfights are regularly hosted in Shiba Gulch, allowing investors to earn $SHIBASHOOT tokens based on their gaming prowess. Marshal Shiba leads the fights in the Crypto Wild West.Due to its practical dimension and utility, the token has value beyond market speculation. In addition, the game's launch before its token release underscores Shiba Shootout's commitment to utility from the beginning. The $SHIBASHOOT craze is rapidly spreading across Telegram and Twitter.Meme coins are known for their dizzying rise and fall. With a unique ecosystem, Shiba Shootout brilliantly attempts to maximise the rise and minimise the fall.Shiba Inu (SHIB) has a gigantic market cap and historical appeal. When it comes to investment appeal, Shiba Inu lags. SHIB’s lacklustre performance over the last few years is an illustration of its saturation.SHIB doesn’t have a lot of steam left. Due to its much lower initial market cap and the heavily discounted presale prices, Shiba Shootout offers a more fertile investment opportunity.The allure of crypto Wild West adventures and sustainable tokenomics makes it one of the top new altcoins to watch now.",Crypto All-Stars ($STARS) is the latest meme coin to whip up a buying frenzy in the meme coin market. Pepe Unchained ($PEPU) is one of the most interesting new projects of 2024. Shiba Shootout ($SHIBASH) is set to be the next big force in the new altcoin sector.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112894458,imgsize-777802,width-838,resizemode-4/112894458.jpg"

Air travelers in Malaysia to get full refund for delayed flights,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/air-travelers-in-malaysia-to-get-full-refund-for-delayed-flights/articleshow/112883937.cms,"Airlines in Malaysia will have to give passengers the option of a refund if their flight is delayed for five hours or more, as the Southeast Asian nation joins countries beefing up consumer air-travel rights.Transport regulators around the world are pressuring carriers to improve standards after a series of flight schedule meltdowns and questionable business practices sparked calls for reform.In Australia, Qantas Airways Ltd. was sued for allegedly selling seats on thousands of canceled flights.Malaysia’s new rules, which take effect from Monday, will also apply to passengers who chose not to proceed with the delayed flight and opt to purchase a different flight altogether.The country’s flagship carrier has been suffering a series of disruptions due to ongoing engine-related problems on its Airbus SE A330 aircraft. Malaysia Airlines said earlier this month that it needs to reduce its flight network between now and December.Refunds will need to be offered via the original means of payment, Malaysia’s transport ministry said.Earlier this year, the US Department of Transportation ordered airlines to provide automatic refunds for flights that are axed or significantly delayed. Protections for travelers in the US were strengthened after spiraling complaints about airlines refusing or delaying refunds.Australia meanwhile has started consulting on wholesale reforms to boost competition and consumer rights in aviation, including making it easier for passengers to be refunded.Qantas Chief Executive Officer Vanessa Hudson, talking to investors after the release of the carrier’s full-year financial results on Thursday, said that forcing airlines to refund fares for cancellations and delays just adds to ticket costs, because airlines will look to recoup the added expenses elsewhere.Malaysia said airlines found to be contravening the new regulations may be fined a maximum of 200,000 ringgit ($46,000) and the amount could be more for subsequent breaches.",Malaysia will require airlines to give passengers the option of a refund if their flight is delayed for five hours or more.

Nvidia tumbles after disappointing forecast,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/nvidia-tumbles-after-disappointing-forecast/articleshow/112881809.cms,"Nvidia Corp failed to live up to investor hopes with its latest results on Wednesday, delivering an underwhelming forecast and news of production snags with its much-awaited Blackwell chips.The company’s quarterly report — the most anticipated part of the tech industry’s earnings season — met or beat analysts’ estimates on nearly every measure. But Nvidia investors have grown accustomed to blowout quarters, and the latest numbers didn’t qualify.Moreover, Nvidia’s next big cash cow — the new Blackwell processor lineup — has proven more challenging to manufacture than anticipated. The product is the next generation of the company’s dominant artificial intelligence processor, and fears of delays contributed to a stock decline of as much as 8.4% in late trading. The shares had more than doubled this year through Wednesday’s close, following a gain of 239% in 2023.“It was up against lofty and unsustainable expectations,” Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Kunjan Sobhani and Oscar Hernandez Tejada said in a note.Third-quarter revenue will be about $32.5 billion, the company said. Though analysts had predicted $31.9 billion on average, estimates ranged as high as $37.9 billion.The disappointing outlook threatens to tamp down an AI frenzy that has transformed Nvidia into the world’s second-most-valuable company. The chipmaker is the key beneficiary of a race to upgrade data centers to handle AI software, and its sales forecasts have become a barometer for that spending boom.Heading into the announcement, there was concern that Nvidia was having problems with its new Blackwell design. The company acknowledged that there were issues with production, saying that it was making changes to improve its manufacturing yield — the number of functioning chips that come out of factories. At the same time, the company said it expects to bring in “several billion dollars” of revenue in the fourth quarter from the product.Supplies will be plentiful after manufacturing gains momentum, Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang said later during a Bloomberg Television interview. “We’re going to have lots and lots of supply, and we will be able to ramp,” he said. Nvidia is coming off a string of quarters that shattered Wall Street expectations — even as analysts continued to raise estimates. But the amount of upside has been trending down.Most of Nvidia’s growth also has come from a small group of customers. About 40% of Nvidia’s revenue stems from large data-center operators — companies like Alphabet Inc’s Google and Meta Platforms Inc — which are pouring tens of billions of dollars into AI infrastructure.Though Meta and others have increased their capital expenditure budgets this earnings season, there’s been concern that the amount of infrastructure being put in place exceeds current requirements. That could lead to a bubble. But Nvidia’s Huang has maintained that this is only the beginning of a new era for technology and the economy.Expectations were lofty. Nvidia has been the best performing stock in the S&P 500 Index this year, eclipsing gains by all other semiconductor companies. At a market value of more than $3 trillion, Nvidia is worth roughly the same amount as the next 10 largest chip firms combined.Nvidia made its name by selling video-game cards, but is now best known for so-called AI accelerators. These chips, derived from its graphics processors, are used to develop artificial intelligence software by bombarding it with information.The process, known as training, makes AI models better at recognizing and responding to real-world inputs. Nvidia’s components are also used in systems that then run the software, a stage known as inference, and help power services such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT .Last quarter’s results topped Wall Street projections, and the Santa Clara, California-based company’s board approved an additional $50 billion in stock buybacks.Nvidia’s revenue more than doubled to $30 billion in the fiscal second quarter, which ended July 28. Excluding certain items, profit was 68 cents a share. Analysts had predicted sales of about $28.9 billion and earnings of 64 cents a share.Nvidia got a jump on other chipmakers because its technology was well-suited to the needs of AI. But rivals are trying to catch up. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. is now its closest competitor, with Intel Corp. — once the world’s biggest chipmaker — trailing further behind. Their combined revenue from the market is only about 5% of Nvidia’s total.Nvidia’s data-center division — now by far its largest source of sales — generated $26.3 billion of revenue last quarter. Gaming chips provided $2.9 billion. Analysts had given targets of $25.1 billion for the data-center unit and $2.79 billion for gaming.Blackwell is expected to generate a fresh wave of growth when it rolls out in the coming months. Analysts have downplayed concerns about delays, noting that the company still enjoys huge demand for its current generation of products. That could help Nvidia cope with any delays without a big financial hit.In describing its challenges with Blackwell, Nvidia said it had to change a mask production step to improve its yield. A mask is the template used to burn the circuit pattern into materials deposited on a disk of silicon.Production of Blackwell is set to ramp up in the fourth quarter and continue into the next fiscal year, Nvidia said.During a post-results conference call, analysts sought more details on the amount of revenue that the new Blackwell chips would deliver and when. Huang and Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress stuck to their promise of billions of dollars in the fourth quarter, refusing to elaborate further.The stock extended its declines as the call went on and answers weren’t provided.In his typical fashion, Huang made high-level predictions on the future of the computing industry, arguing that a trillion dollars of equipment will be needed to replace outmoded gear in the world’s data centers. That replacement process is just beginning, he said.AI is taking over computer search, helping companies speed up their business processes, and needed by countries to secure data, he said.“It’s affecting how every layer of computing is done,” Huang said.",N Nvidia Corp delivered an underwhelming forecast and news of production snags with its much-awaited Blackwell chips.

US Fed not convinced with 'fast' cross-border payment,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-fed-not-convinced-with-fast-cross-border-payment/articleshow/112880788.cms,"MUMBAI: The US has expressed reservations about the international linking of domestic fast payments like the UPI to make global transactions faster and cheaper.""Today's consumers and businesses can generally send a payment anywhere in the world, but they all seem to want faster and cheaper global payments, just like we always want faster flights and cheaper airfares.However, I am not entirely convinced that interlinking arrangements will necessarily deliver on those goals,"" said Christopher J Waller, member of the board of governors for the Federal Reserve System .""There is no silver bullet that increases speed and efficiency without trade-offs. Unless new solutions are found, interlinking fast payment systems might increase the risk-management burden for banks that participate in them. That is, legal, compliance, and operational considerations are critical to the discussion of the promise and challenges of interlinking,"" said Waller. He was speaking at the Global Fintech Fest here on Wednesday.The Fed has launched its own fast payment network FedNow Service. ""We are still at the beginning of a multiyear journey of establishing a ubiquitous network covering the majority of institutions in our country. Variation around the world in domestic fast payment network adoption means that the value of globally interlinked systems is not yet clear,"" said Waller.The governor said technical feasibility and legal issues can be managed as some bilateral arrangements have shows, but each link needs complex negotiations and bilateral links are impractical for global scale. While multilateral setups offer efficiencies, they are still resource-intensive. However, RBI executive director P Vasudevan was still hopeful of linking India-US fast payments. ""You have given a positive hope that we will see the linkage happen between FedNow and UPI even if it may take a little while,"" Vasudevan said, adding that it will make remittances cheaper and faster.","The US has expressed reservations about the international linking of domestic fast payments like the UPI.
