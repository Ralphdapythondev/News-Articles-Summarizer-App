Who is required to pay the penalty?

Income Exceeds Basic Exemption Limit: Taxpayers whose income exceeds the basic exemption limit will be penalised for late filing. The limit varies by tax regime: Rs 3 lakh under the new tax regime, irrespective of age, and different limits under the old tax regime based on age.

Section 139(1) Conditions: Even if income is below the exemption limit, taxpayers must file an ITR if they meet specific conditions in Section 139(1). These include:

Spending Rs 2 lakh or more on foreign travel. Paying Rs 1 lakh or more in electricity bills. Depositing Rs 1 crore or more in current accounts.

Holding Foreign Assets: Residents with foreign assets or income must file an ITR, even if their income is below the exemption limit. Late filing fees apply in these cases.

Exceptions to Penalties

How is a belated ITR filed?

Income Tax Return Filing FY 2023-24 : For individual taxpayers whose accounts do not need auditing, the last date to file income tax returns (ITRs) for FY 2023–24 (AY 2024–25) is July 31, 2024. Missing this deadline means filing a belated ITR , which comes with penalties and interest.Under Section 234F of the Income Tax Act, 1961, filing a belated ITR incurs a penalty of up to Rs 5,000.For small taxpayers with a taxable income not exceeding Rs 5 lakh, the penalty is restricted to Rs 1,000, according to an ET report. The important thing to note is that this penalty applies even if the belated ITR shows zero tax payable. Additionally, penal interest on the pending tax payable must be paid when filing a belated ITR.Certain taxpayers are required to pay penalties if they miss the ITR filing deadline and they fulfil the following conditions:Also Read | ITR refund status for FY 2023-24: How to check income tax refund status online - here’s a step-by-step guide for incometax.gov.in & NSDL websites Individuals might need to submit an income tax return to receive a refund.

Street play: Social bourse helps NGOs raise funds,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/street-play-social-bourse-helps-ngos-raise-funds/articleshow/112210116.cms,"MUMBAI: Matchmaking between retail donors wishing to 'give back' and credible non-profit organisations, the finance ministry recently launched a Social Stock Exchange , an electronic fund-raising platform that enables public money to reach these organisations that have been through compliance guidelines like any other listed company.The Mumbai-based Swades Foundation , which works in rural Maharashtra, opens its issue on the exchange on Friday.In Oct 2023, the exchange listed its first 'company', Unnati, a Bangalore-based voluntary organisation (NGO) which equips underprivileged youth to find employment. Other organisations listed include Swami Vivekananda Youth Movement, also in Bangalore, and the Delhi-based Transform Rural India.The unusual exchange, operated by the National Stock Exchange (NSE) and monitored by markets regulator Sebi, enables social enterprises and NGOs to raise capital through equity , debt as well as units that operate like mutual funds. Given that donors are often perplexed over how to select a deserving organisation, and whether their money is being used effectively, the listed organisation must comply with various governance and financial transparency requirements both to get listed and also continue to stay listed on the exchange.The organisation must maintain a social impact scorecard. Donors will receive a quarterly report, just like in the case of other listed companies.

New Budget 2024 rule: Why Income Tax Department is likely to issue a huge number of tax notices this month,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-budget-2024-rule-why-income-tax-department-is-likely-to-issue-a-huge-number-of-tax-notices-this-month/articleshow/112186079.cms,"Taxing Times

Income Tax Notice on the way? The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month, as there are concerns that many taxpayers might escape the tax net due to the impending implementation of the new reassessment law on September 1, 2024.According to the amended regulation announced in Budget 2024 , the tax authorities can only go back a maximum of five years to reassess a taxpayer's records if the escaped income is at least Rs 50 lakh, and three years for an amount less than Rs 50 lakh.Previously, they could reassess cases up to 10 years old.According to an ET report, tax officials are now faced with the challenge of compiling and corroborating data on tax and income mismatches for the financial years 2013-14 to 2017-18 within the next few weeks, as these years will become time-barred for reassessment from September 1, 2024.The I-T department relies on information from various sources, such as banks, property registrars, and search findings from the investigation wing, to build reassessment cases.A tax officers' body has raised concerns about the feasibility of issuing notices under Section 148 (or 148A) in a large number of cases within a single month, given the overburdened nature of the jurisdictional assessing officers and the time-consuming process of obtaining sanction from the chief commissioner, who is the specified authority for such notices.Moreover, the law provides taxpayers with the right to explain their position before reassessment orders are finalized, a process that most believe cannot be completed by the end of August.Also Read | ITR refund status for FY 2023-24: How to check income tax refund status online - here’s a step-by-step guide for incometax.gov.in & NSDL websites The Central Board of Direct Taxes ( CBDT ) has been urged by its officers to postpone the effective date of the proposed amendment. However, this suggestion is unlikely to be well-received by corporations and high net worth individuals.""Capping the reassessment period at five years was a great decision as it would reduce hassles and litigation. But if the department fears there could be a genuine loss of revenue as it may not be possible to wrap up several matters by August 31, the government can think of strict parameters where time-bound cases can be selectively reopened - based on trails of steps taken in identifying escaped income,"" said Mitil Chokshi, partner at CA firm Chokshi & Chokshi.""Taxpayers may expect a rush of reassessment notices in August 2024. These notices are likely to be for the AYs 2018-19 and prior to that. It is pertinent to note that the Bombay High Court in a recent ruling in a case of Hexaware Technologies has taken a view on a proviso introduced in 2021, which can be interpreted to mean that AY 2017-18 (and prior years) got time barred on March 31, 2024. These reassessment notices (for AYs 2017-18 and prior) are likely to rake up new interpretation issues in the already muddled reassessment provisions,"" said Ashish Mehta, partner at law firm Khaitan & Co.The current situation is similar to the conflict between the Income Tax office and taxpayers in 2021. The reassessment law was amended in April 2021, allowing the tax office to reopen 10-year-old tax returns if the total undisclosed income exceeded Rs 50 lakh and reassess 4-year-old matters if the amount was less than Rs 50 lakh.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? However, this change led to over 10,000 writ petitions being filed by companies, arguing that they were not given sufficient time to explain and that the notices were issued without considering the carve-out that cases which couldn't be reopened earlier couldn't be reassessed under the new law.The Supreme Court invoked its extraordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution on May 4, 2022, to uphold all reassessment notices issued after March 31, 2021. However, the court left room for judicial proceedings based on the merits of each case, and several such matters are currently pending before the court.","The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month.

NPS and EPF: Overlapping services

What is NPS Vatsalaya?

Latest NPS rules, news: In the Union Budget 2024 speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced two new initiatives with regard to National Pension Scheme (NPS) - extension of NPS 14% employer contribution benefits to private setcor and the intended launch of NPS Vatsalya.Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries, bringing it at par with the provisions available for government employees.Sriram Iyer, CEO, HDFC Pension Management told ET that with this move the “ground rules have been harmonised among government and non-government employees, which is a positive step.”Effectively, this means that now, private-sector employees can choose to reduce the taxable portion of employers’ contribution to their NPS corpus, thereby paying less tax and leaving greater funds in their pension deposits.“Employees will benefit from tax savings . More importantly, the 40% increase in contribution will have a significant impact on the terminal value of the retirement corpus,” remarked Iyer. The extended savings will “help in retirement planning, working as an option that is at par with the Provident Fund,” Dinesh Rohira, CEO & Founder, 5nance.com was quoted as saying.Moreover, the endeavour aims to increase NPS penetration by increasing tax incentives for the private sector, providing them a social security-cushion post-retirement.The scheme’s motive to widen the NPS subscriber base may not prove to be flawlessly effective, however. This is explained by Agrees Mrin Agarwal, Founder, Finsafe India: “While it’s good that the limit has been raised, it may not increase adoption as employees need to be educated in a big way. Also, the benefit is only for the salaried opting for the new tax regime,” she says.The mandatory contribution to the EPF, too, threatens to relegate the provisions of NPS under the umbrella of near-superfluity. This sentiment is echoed by Varun Sahay, a software engineer in a Delhi-based IT company: “When 12% of my salary is already deducted for the EPF, why should I put in more in the NPS and cut my take-home pay?”Rohira feels otherwise. “There’s no competition between the NPS and EPF as employees can contribute to both and build a 3-4 times bigger corpus while earning 3-4% higher returns via marketlinked options in the NPS,” he counters.Also Check | New Tax Regime 2023 vs 2024 After Budget: How Much Income Tax Will Salaried Taxpayers Save & How Do New Tax Slabs Compare To Old Regime? Top 10 Points You Must Know To jumpstart retirement savings for children, a new initiative called NPS Vatsalya has been unveiled in the Budget. This scheme allows parents and guardians to contribute to a minor's account, which can be converted into a regular NPS account once the child reaches adulthood.""It provides a very long duration for reaping the compounding benefits and accumulating a huge bounty at a later age. This can be a good way to plan a better future for kids who may not opt for a service segment in the future,"" says Rohira. Sriram Iyer agrees, stating, ""It’s a good move to help the child start his retirement journey. Even if a parent starts when the child is 10 years old, by the time he starts working, it can be a solid foundation for the compounding journey after that.""However, some experts question the utility of a product with such a long lock-in period, especially when parents cannot use the funds for essential goals like their child’s education amidst soaring education costs of 11-12%.""Parents are struggling to save for their own retirement, so it might be a bit of a stretch to expect them to save for their kids’ retirement. The need of the hour is a market-linked product that allows withdrawals only for the child’s education,"" says Mrin Agarwal, Founder of Finsafe India.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? Though the NPS permits partial withdrawals, it allows only 25% of the corpus after three years of joining, and this can be done only three times during the entire tenure. A premature exit before 60 years with 100% withdrawal is only possible if the corpus is less than Rs.2.5 lakh, an amount insufficient for most children's goals.""In its current form, there won’t be any uptake,"" asserts Agarwal. Rohira concurs, ""It’s a vanilla product with a lock-in, which does not make it very attractive and it may not take off. However, the government may optimise it and introduce new features later."" Iyer adds, ""This is just a start and there may be more subscriber-friendly features as we take it to the market. The regulator is proactive and open to feedback.""","Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries.

Gold import duty cut: Why Indians may not find buying gold from Dubai as attractive post Budget 2024,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-import-duty-cut-why-indians-may-not-find-buying-gold-from-dubai-as-attractive-post-budget-2024/articleshow/112097671.cms,"Gold import duty cut in Budget 2024: The recent reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai. Indian jewellers with stores in both India and the UAE believe that the narrowed duty differential will result in lower gold prices in India, making it less attractive for Indians to purchase gold in Dubai.The emirate had attracted gold-enthusiast Indians following a steep rise in customs duty in India in July 2022. In the fiscal 2024-25 budget, the duty on gold imports was more than halved.The duty cut is also expected to boost gold jewellery production in India, particularly the popular 'Kolkatti' jewellery from Kolkata, which is favored by Indian expats in Dubai and tourists from various countries. This move will encourage gold artisans to create new designs in both heavyweight and lightweight jewellery, attracting consumers to purchase gold from India.According to an ET report, Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group , estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India as Indian tourists who previously bought jewellery in Dubai will now prefer to shop in India.

He points out that the labour cost is significantly lower in India, and with the introduction of mandatory hallmarking and HUID numbers, the purity of gold in India is no longer a concern.Furthermore, NRIs in Dubai do not receive VAT refunds, and Indians travelling abroad only receive about 60% of the VAT back on their gold purchases. Gold trade analyst Bhargav Baidya suggests that the 1% duty differential between gold jewellery in India and Dubai will be offset by Indian jewellers offering discounts to retain and attract customers.Saurabh Gadgil, chairman of PNG Jewellers, notes that Indian import duty is now on par with the US, allowing Indian jewellers to offer competitive prices compared to other countries worldwide. The reduced customs duty is expected to make gold purchases in India more attractive and convenient for Indian consumers, potentially leading to a significant shift in their gold shopping preferences.",The reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai.

Gold losing sheen? The government has reduced its target for issuing gold bonds in the financial year 2024-25 by 38% compared to the previous interim budget goal, according to a senior official. The revised target stands at Rs 18,500 crore, down from Rs 29,638 crore estimated in the interim budget and Rs 26,852 crore (revised estimate) in 2023-24.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told ET ""The decision followed a reassessment of various factors, including investor demand, other investment products and uncertainties around the global economy, as the situation has changed since the interim budget in February.""After accounting for redemptions, the net issuances of sovereign gold bonds are now estimated at Rs 15,000 crore for this fiscal year, a significant decrease from the Rs 26,138 crore projected in the interim budget and Rs 25,352 crore in the revised estimate for 2023-24.Harish Galipelli, director at ILA Commodities India, attributed this shift to retail investors increasingly opting for equities in anticipation of better returns. He also noted that people are uncertain about the potential for further increases in gold prices in the short-to-medium term following a recent rally. Additionally, Galipelli pointed out that savings in rural areas have been impacted by retail inflation and other factors.The gold bond and gold monetisation schemes were introduced by the government in late 2015 to discourage the physical purchase of precious metals and reduce imports, thereby mitigating the negative impact on the current account deficit.The gross collection through these two schemes is now projected to be Rs 20,030 crore in 2024-25, compared to Rs 31,168 crore in the interim budget and Rs 28,240 crore (revised estimate) in the previous fiscal year. Similarly, the net collection is estimated at Rs 16,433 crore, down from Rs 27,571 crore in the interim budget and Rs 26,653 crore in the previous year.

The Union Budget has taken steps to promote retirement planning by enhancing the tax advantage on NPS contributions and introducing a new option for minor children in the pension system .The deduction under Section 80CCD(2) is set to be raised from 10% to 14% of the basic salary. This section permits you to contribute up to 10% of your basic pay to NPS tax-free. Previously, only government employees were eligible for the 14% deduction, but now this benefit has been extended to the private sector as well.“It is proposed to increase the amount of deduction allowed to an employer in respect of his contribution to a pension scheme referred to in section 80CCD, from the extent of 10% to the extent of 14% of the salary of the employee.

Budget 2024 : India's Economic Survey for 2024 revealed the country's infrastructure leap. FY24 capital expenditure has seen almost threefold increase from FY20 with concerted efforts to boost physical connectivity, electricity, water and sanitation, urban development, strategic and digital infrastructure. It also marked emphasis on resource mobilisation from new sources and data aggregation and management for tracking projects and optimal allocation of scarce resources.While capital allocation for major infrastructure sub-sectors like roads, railways, etc. continues as already announced by the government during the interim Budget, the current final Budget heralds a transformative vision for the eastern states with the ‘Purvodaya’ plan, targeting holistic growth with announcements of new roads, power plant, airports, colleges and sports infrastructure.For the shipping sector, the government has announced ownership, leasing and flagging reforms which should improve the share of the Indian shipping industry and generate more employment.Capital projects in the sector uplifts the society at large and generates employment. Brownfield redevelopment of cities and houses for the poor will fuel demand in the sector thereby generating employment and economic growth. Additionally, the government has announced an employment incentive scheme for first time employers to further fillip jobs creation and youth empowerment.From a tax standpoint, the government recognised the potential of cruise tourism in India and in order to give a fillip to this employment generating industry, a simplified tax regime where 20 percent of revenues will be deemed as income from such business will be considered for the purpose of income-tax.India has recognised the need to have a robust MRO ecosystem for the airline and boat & ship sector in view of increased demand. From Customs perspective, the period for export of goods which are imported for repairs and requirement to re-import goods which are exported for repairs under warranty has been extended.The government recognises the need for participation from the private sector in this critical sector including investments from foreign investors. Deletion of angel tax provision is a welcome move which will propel raising of funds in the sector.Second round of VSV gives opportunity to minimise litigation with focus on ease of doing business.On an overall basis, this year’s Budget lays down a framework to propel growth and generate employment with higher involvement of the private sector in upskilling India and some relaxation for individual taxpayers."," FY24 capital expenditure has seen almost threefold increase from FY20.

This, in turn, led to under reporting of income. These individuals offered the overseas income net of tax and at the same time claimed a foreign tax credit (FTC) for taxes withheld overseas against their India tax liability.In short - they got a double advantage.The Budget proposes to amend section 198 of the I-T Act to include income taxes paid outside India for the purpose of computing the income of the taxpayer who is liable to tax in India. This proposal will be effective financial year 2024-25.Parizad Sirwalla, partner and head (global mobility services tax) at KPMG India, said, ""The amendment is more clarificatory in nature. This was always the correct position. As explained in the explanatory memorandum. It appears that some taxpayers (including companies) were not doing so and hence this amendment was introduced making it abundantly clear.""She gives an illustration. An Indian employee of an Indian subsidiary of a German company was granted shares under the global Esop plan. He was eligible to receive dividend of 100 euros on such shares. According to German law, 10 euros was withheld and the balance was transferred to the employee's Indian bank account.""The correct tax position was always to offer the entire 100 euros as income and claim 10 euros as a double tax relief (credit against Indian tax liability on such 100 euros),"" KPMG India's Sirwalla added.Ameya Kunte, founder, Globeview Advisors, points out a few decisions where overseas tax was not held part of the total income assessable to tax in India - these now stand overturned.""The MP high court in the case of Yawar Rashid had held that the tax deducted at source outside India from foreign dividends and interest income was not part of the total income and thus not assessable in the hands of the taxpayer. This HC decision was also relied upon by the Bangalore bench of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal in the case of Sunil Shinde. The proposed amendment makes it clear tax deducted at source outside India, will be part of income. The taxpayer can claim a foreign tax credit against the Indian taxes due on the overseas income.""",The Budget proposes to amend section 198 of the I-T Act to include income taxes paid outside India for the purpose of computing the income of the taxpayer who is liable to tax in India.

Sources said Rahul specifically told the members to focus on what their respective states have not got in the Budget, rather than speaking about what others have got. The party decided to accommodate maximum states through MPs in its allocated four hours discussion time.

"Intel to lay off 15,000 employees in major cost-cutting move",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/intel-to-lay-off-15000-employees-in-major-cost-cutting-move-amid-struggles-against-rivals/articleshow/112209650.cms,"Intel Corp. announced on Thursday that it will cut approximately 15% of its global workforce, amounting to 15,000 jobs, in a bold attempt to streamline its operations and remain competitive with industry leaders like Nvidia and AMD . The sweeping layoffs come as part of a broader strategy to save $10 billion by 2025, according to a memo from Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger .“Simply put, we must align our cost structure with our new operating model and fundamentally change the way we operate,” Gelsinger wrote. He cited disappointing revenue growth and the company’s slow adaptation to emerging trends like artificial intelligence (AI) as key reasons for the drastic measures.The job cuts follow a challenging quarter for Intel, which reported a $1.6 billion loss in its April-June earnings report, alongside a slight revenue decline to $12.8 billion. The disappointing performance led to a 19% drop in Intel’s stock during after-hours trading, signaling a potential $24 billion loss in market value when trading resumes on Friday.To further curtail expenses, Intel also announced the suspension of its stock dividend, a move that underscores the severity of the company’s financial woes. The layoffs and other cost-cutting measures are expected to be largely completed by the end of the year.In his memo, Gelsinger acknowledged the difficulty of the decision, calling it “the hardest thing I’ve done in my career.” The company plans to offer enhanced retirement options and a voluntary departure program for eligible employees.Analysts, however, are skeptical that these cuts alone will be enough to reposition Intel in the rapidly evolving semiconductor market. “Intel’s announcement of a significant cost-cutting plan including layoffs may bolster its near-term financials, but this move alone is insufficient to redefine its position in the evolving chip market,"" said eMarketer analyst Jacob Bourne.Intel has struggled to keep pace with competitors like Nvidia, whose dominance in the AI chip market has been a particular challenge. Unlike its rivals, Intel also manufactures its own chips, which has placed additional pressure on the company’s margins as it invests heavily in expanding its U.S. foundry business.The company’s efforts have been buoyed by significant support from the U.S. government, particularly through the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act, which aims to bolster domestic semiconductor manufacturing. Intel has secured up to $8.5 billion in direct funding and $11 billion in loans to build new chip plants across the country, part of a long-term strategy to reduce reliance on Asian-made semiconductors.Despite these investments, Gelsinger acknowledged that Intel’s focus on the AI PC market would strain profit margins in the short term, though he expressed confidence that the trade-offs would pay off in the coming years. “We believe the trade-offs are worth it. The AI PC will grow from less than 10% of the market today to greater than 50% in 2026,” he told analysts.","Intel Corp. announced on Thursday that it will cut approximately 15% of its global workforce, amounting to 15,000 jobs.

How some companies manipulated the H-1B visa lottery,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/how-some-companies-manipulated-the-h-1b-visa-lottery/articleshow/112201712.cms,"Each year in April, the US conducts a lottery that shapes the lives of hundreds of thousands of people. And each year, only around 85,000 are granted an H-1B visa for highly-skilled workers. With skyrocketing application numbers, the odds of winning have only gotten slimmer. But new data obtained by Bloomberg News has revealed how certain companies have manipulated the system, gaining an advantage over people who play it fair.In other words, the game was rigged.On today’s Big Take podcast, host Sarah Holder speaks to investigative journalists Eric Fan and Zachary Mider, who explain how outsourcing companies and staffing firms exploited loopholes in the H-1B system to get extra shots at the lottery.Here is a lightly edited transcript of the conversation:Holder: When Sandeep Maganti first moved to the US from India for college, he had a passion for technology and a laser focus on the future.Maganti: I was a teenager that was hoping to build a whole new life and whole new career and trying to see where my luck or all my hard work takes me at that point.Holder: After getting a computer science degree from Arizona State University, he teamed up with a fellow ASU alum to launch a startup.Maganti: It's an AI-powered real estate investment platform. We run the models on the back end, predicting the revenue of short-term real estate investments or commercial real estate investments.Holder: Sandeep said they raised $400,000 from a private investor and turned their idea into a company valued at over a million dollars. It was just a few years into his time in the US, and he was already on track to build the kind of life and career he’d dreamed of as a teenager. But something else loomed over him. He’d managed to stay in the country legally through a student visa and a series of work authorizations, but his status in the States was still temporary. And that meant he was living with a lot of uncertainty.Holder: And throughout all this, Sandeep, did your immigration status weigh on you at all? How did it impact your work?Maganti: So that's been the whole problem. You can't have a solid decision or like anything solid until you have your immigration plan solid because you can't buy a house or you can't build a business or you can't do whatever you're looking for in your life. It’s not something you can be stable on. It impacts every decision that you're making in your life.Holder: Sandeep wanted a more long-term plan. So he stepped away from the day to day of running his startup, got a job at another US-based company and set his sights on the H-1B — a visa designed for highly-skilled workers with employers in the US. A limited number of H-1B visas are handed out each year through a lottery system. And the first time he applied, he wasn’t picked. Or the next. Or the next.Maganti: It was really devastating for me. I was like eight years into the United States, and I still don't have a life which I can rely on or a career that I can rely on. So I don't have clarity on what I need to do.Holder: Sandeep had the job and the sponsor. But his lottery ticket wasn’t drawn.Eric: His qualification didn't matter. His investment and entrepreneurship didn't matter. The fact that he was already employing people and starting a company here didn't matter. It was a complete game of luck.Holder: Eric Fan is an investigative data reporter at Bloomberg. And for the past few months, he’s been looking into how the H-1B system actually works. And he found that there’s something else at play — making that game of luck even more precarious, and it’s stacking the deck against workers and employers who seem to be doing everything right. Today on the show: a Bloomberg investigation reveals how companies have been exploiting loopholes to game the H-1B system — and what that could mean for hundreds of thousands of visa hopefuls.Holder: Every year, employers in the US submit hundreds of thousands of applications for H-1Bs, hoping to give their employees a shot at a visa. An H-1B typically lasts up to six years, and is often an on-ramp to permanent residency. The number of visas awarded every year is currently capped at about 85,000. But when Eric tried to figure out the chances of getting one, he noticed that between 2020 and 2023, the number of applications for that limited pool had doubled. That meant the odds of getting an H-1B visa were getting worse, fast.Fan: So, as I talked to my friends, as I go online, it became very apparent that there's a huge problem in the system.Holder: And that problem goes back to the way the system was designed.Mider: Since the very beginning, the program has sort of been dogged by concerns that certain companies were kind of finding a way to get a disproportionate share of the visas.Holder: That's Bloomberg investigative reporter Zach Mider. He says the flaws in the system trace back to the way the H-1B program was set up in response to pressure from tech companies that started building in the 1980s.Mider: Employers in the US were telling Congress, we can't get enough workers in certain fields, especially high-tech fields. And so when Congress reformed its immigration laws in 1990, they said, we're going to create this category of visa called H-1B that's going to be specifically for high-skilled workers that you don't think you can find in the American job market.Holder: At first, the system was first come, first serve. The vision was that employers would apply for the visas gradually throughout the year — and once they ran out, the government would stop granting them. But by the mid-2000s, it was clear that the system needed to change. Because on April 1st every year, when the visa application window opened, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services office would be overrun.Fan: Hundreds of thousands of applications were coming in literal paper boxes from FedEx. And the US government would have so much trouble processing those paperwork, there wasn't enough time for them to figure out who came first and who came second. It became a necessity to run a random lottery.Holder: A random lottery… with very expensive tickets.Fan: Employers had to file a full visa application, which runs hundreds of pages. They have to pay thousands of dollars in application fees. They have to describe exactly what job they want to fill. Here's the individual, here's the job, here's the salary we're going to pay them, here's the location they're going to work from.Holder: But in any lottery, the odds of winning go up if you buy more tickets. The same principle applied to the H-1B lottery. Employers who could submit more applications had a better chance of getting their employees visas. And Zach says, that gave an advantage to certain types of companies, like huge IT outsourcing firms, mostly based overseas.Mider: Let's say you're an outsourcing company that has 200,000 workers in India, and you have a need for a certain number of those workers to be in the United States for a certain period of time. If you say, figure you need a thousand of them next year, but you're not too particular about which thousand, then you can simply do the math and you could say, well, my chances of success in the lottery are, you know, 25%. And I need a thousand people. So I'll put in 4,000 applications of people who would be good enough at those roles, and I'll get about a thousand. And so, while your company that just had the one worker has a 25% chance of getting what they want, the outsourcing company can kind of leverage its foreign workforce to get 100% of the visas they want.Holder: In 2020, the Trump administration changed the application process. Instead of entering the lottery with a full-fledged application, employers would only need to fill out a short form and pay a $10 fee to get their employee’s name in the mix. Then, only if their lottery ticket was drawn would they need to go through with the whole application. The goal was to cut down on paperwork and save money. But it also had another effect.Fan: That massively increased the opportunity to flood the lottery.Holder: When tickets got cheaper in 2020, Eric and Zach said it created opportunities for another kind of company to game the system: staffing firms. These firms essentially work as middlemen: recruiting foreign workers and connecting them with contract jobs at US-based companies. And part of their pitch is that they can get you an H-1B visa because of how adept they’ve become at gaming the system.Mider: The new opportunity worked like this. If I have a person who I want to help get a visa, I can simply just create a bunch of other companies or just conspire with other companies that already exist to put that person's name in multiple times. And so it becomes a system where, essentially, if someone wants a visa and they can kind of work with these— a group of these very small companies. They can almost be guaranteed to get one. And so the chances really skyrocket for people who are willing to work with these kinds of companies that are willing to cheat and kind of budge ahead in the lottery. And so anybody who's just doing it the old-fashioned way of like, I actually have a real job and I want this worker to have an H-1B. They get pushed to the end of the line because they're not putting the person's name in more than once.Holder: Zach says those staffing firms have been able to fly under the radar. Because many of them are very small.Mider: If it was Apple or Tesla that did this, I think with thousands of employees, I think the government would have caught on pretty quickly and probably tried to do something to them. But these are all like companies you've never heard of, often that don't really have much physical existence. Like maybe they have an office, maybe they don't, maybe they're just like an LLC that somebody created without much real existence at all.Holder: For a long time, it was impossible for reporters like Eric and Zach to figure out the extent of the problem or which companies were the worst offenders.Fan: That data was never public and we had to file a FOIA lawsuit. So for the first time, we're able to say exactly how many companies are gaming the system. And we were very surprised because we've found thousands and thousands of them. And it became immediately clear that these staffing companies have— sometimes 99%, 100% of their entries are these multiple entries as compared to a regular company, such as Apple, Google, would usually have less than 5%.Holder: There are legitimate reasons for someone to have multiple applications entered on their behalf – say, if they have competing offers from several companies to sponsor them. But those situations are uncommon. So when Eric found these instances in which 100% of a company’s applicants were being entered multiple times, the stat was striking.Fan: I thought there was a problem, but it was so much worse than I imagined. And it turned out almost half of all the visas that were approved last year went to either outsourcing or staffing companies, meaning for most of the folks who study and live and work in the US who have a job offer from one of the top companies like Google and Tesla, they're losing out.Holder: So Eric and Zach identified the biggest H-1B cheaters, the question was, would anything be done to stop them? That’s after the break.Holder: A Bloomberg investigation found that about half of the coveted H-1B skilled worker visas between 2020 and 2023 were going to outsourcing companies and staffing firms — and that an estimated one in six involved the slippery tactic of submitting multiple lottery entries for the same person.Holder: What's the impact of this type of gaming of the system? Who exactly is this hurting?Mider: I think the big picture is it's hurting the American economy.Holder: According to a 2023 Wharton School study, for every 10 H-1B visas that top US multinational companies lose out on, nine jobs are moved abroad. The Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond estimated that reducing the number of high-skilled immigrant workers in the US by 10% would shrink the economy by about $86 billion. So there's the economic toll. There's the toll on H-1B hopefuls who are competing in a lottery that's rigged. And then there's the toll on the H-1B recipients whose futures are now tied to companies that skirt the rulesFan: So I've interviewed a number of workers and former workers at these staffing companies and what they told me was they usually knew full well that staffing companies pay them very little and there’s no job security and they often had to sign contracts that forbid them from leaving the company for years. And most egregiously, they were often asked to pay the lawyer fees and visa fees and registration fees, which is not allowed.Holder: Eric and Zach wanted to know, what happened to the companies that they found were bending the rules?Mider: Now, some of the visa recipients have had their visas taken away and have to be sent home or whatever. But the companies themselves, which often were kind of the masterminds of this, don't really have any consequences that we can see. And so, what the government says in response is essentially they don't have the authority to bar anyone from the lottery. And so as long as people keep submitting applications and there's nothing on the application that looks suspect, they have to keep handing out visas to these companies.Holder: Have you gotten comment from any of these companies? What do they say about their practices?Mider: We spoke to a representative of the staffing industry, who said that the laws are actually pretty vague. And that, in his view, it wasn't really clear, especially during the first couple years of this new program, that it was actually forbidden to collude with other companies to put people's names in multiple times. And even after it kind of became more clear that that wasn't allowed under the law, the government may have not followed the proper procedures to kind of make sure everyone is aware of that. And so, from the staffing industry's perspective, it wasn't so much cheating as more just like they saw an opportunity in the law and they took it.Holder: That opportunity no longer exists. Last year, the US government made a significant change to the system that shifted the dynamics of the lottery.Fan: So, last year the government introduced new rules so that each candidate has an equal chance in the lottery. So instead of selecting on the number of registrations submitted by employers, each candidate, regardless of how many registrations they have, has an equal chance.

"Fed hints at rate cut as inflation nears 2% target, keeps rates steady at 5.25%",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/fed-hints-at-rate-cut-as-inflation-nears-2-target-keeps-rates-steady-at-5-25-5-50/articleshow/112176592.cms,"The Federal Reserve on Wednesday indicated that progress has been made towards its 2% inflation target , hinting at a potential rate cut—the first in four years. In a statement following its two-day meeting, the Fed noted that ""job gains have moderated"" and acknowledged a rise in the unemployment rate . The central bank, which is mandated by Congress to ensure stable prices and maximum employment, emphasised it is now ""attentive to the risks"" to both goals, marking a shift from its recent focus solely on controlling inflation.The Fed's policymakers unanimously decided to keep the benchmark interest rate unchanged between 5.25% and 5.50%, according to the statement.This decision reflects ""some further progress"" in combating inflation.Despite pressure from many Democratic officials and some economists to lower rates and support the economy , Fed policymakers opted to maintain their key rate at a 23-year high of 5.3%. Some Republicans, including former President Donald Trump, have argued that a rate cut before the upcoming election could appear politically motivated.Ahead of the Fed's announcement, financial markets had fully anticipated a rate cut at its next meeting on September 17-18, according to futures markets. The Fed generally aims to avoid surprising investors with its rate decisions.The Fed is attempting to balance keeping rates high enough to reduce inflation, which has decreased to 2.5% from a peak of 7.1% two years ago, while avoiding rates so high they could trigger a recession. So far, it appears on track for a ""soft landing,"" where inflation reaches 2% without causing a recession.However, with the unemployment rate rising for three consecutive months, some economists argue that the Fed should have cut rates sooner or should do so more aggressively later this year. Bharat Ramamurti, an advisor at the American Economic Liberties Project and former Biden White House economist, expressed concern, stating, ""The finish line is in sight, and it would be tragic for the Fed to stumble and fall, with one-tenth of a mile left in the marathon.""Additionally, three Democratic senators, led by Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, urged Chair Jerome Powell in a letter to cut rates, warning that failing to do so soon could appear as if the Fed is yielding to external pressures, which they argue would also be a political move.Recent data has provided some positive news on inflation, with the government reporting last Friday that annual inflation fell to 2.5% in July, down from 2.6% in the previous month and marking the lowest rate since February 2021. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate has increased nearly half a percentage point this year to 4.1%, and hiring has slowed. Powell and other Fed officials have increasingly highlighted concerns about the job market , reinforcing market expectations for rate cuts soon.The government is set to release the latest employment figures this Friday, with economists predicting the addition of 175,000 jobs in July and the unemployment rate holding steady at 4.1%.","The Federal Reserve kept its key interest rate at a 23-year high of 5.3%.

Boeing names Ortberg as CEO to revive embattled planemaker,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/boeing-names-ortberg-as-ceo-to-revive-embattled-planemaker/articleshow/112173066.cms,"‘Experienced leader’

Leadership shuffle

Boeing Co appointed Kelly Ortberg as its next chief executive officer, entrusting a retired veteran of the aviation industry with one of the most complex turnaround challenges in corporate America.The US planemaker made the announcement as it reported a steep loss for the second quarter. Ortberg, 64, is an engineer by training who rose through the ranks at Rockwell Collins , an aviation supplier that’s now part of RTX Corp .He will take on the new role on Aug. 8.Boeing rose as much as 2.7% as investors parsed the surprise appointment that ended months of uncertainty after current CEO Dave Calhoun announced in March he would step down. The planemaker is working to placate frustrated airlines and win back the trust of US regulators and the flying public after a near-catastrophe in January was linked to a breakdown in quality controls in its 737 factory outside of Seattle.“Ortberg’s appointment is the best news for Boeing in a long time,” said Nick Cunningham, an aviation analyst at Agency Partners in London. “Right now, Boeing needs a company doctor to come in, turn over every stone, tell everyone the bad news, take the charges needed and then bring about an effective turnaround.”This is a modal window.The media could not be loaded, either because the server or network failed or because the format is not supported.Ortberg will take over a company that’s seen its finances badly dented from the fallout of the January accident. The stock has lost 27% in value this year, which puts it on track for its worst annual performance since 2020.Among his biggest tasks will be to “incentivize and foster continuous problem solving and collaboration on the shop floor, said Nicolas Owens, industrials equity analyst at Morningstar Research Services LLC.“The real test for any Boeing CEO will be navigating the very long cycle and high cost of investment in new plane designs, which can be tricky because the rewards accrue in decades, not years,” Owens said.The planemaker said on Wednesday that it burned through $4.33 billion in cash during the second quarter. That’s after a similar outflow in the first three months, as Boeing slowed down output of its commercial jet factories.Boeing’s defense and space division suffered its worst quarter since mid-2023 as costs ballooned to convert a pair of 747 jumbo jets into the next presidential Air Force One fleet. The company said it recorded $1 billion of losses on fixed-price contracts, including a loss on the KC-46 military tanker program.The defense stumbles are a reminder that Boeing’s operational difficulties extend well beyond its crisis-stricken commercial division. The company has gradually been stepping up output in its 737 Max jets under close supervision by federal regulators, but faces another crisis with a strike deadline looming in September for Seattle-area factory workers.The company said it still expects to increase production of the 737 Max to 38 planes a month, and the 787 Dreamliner to 5 a month by year-end.With the appointment, Ortberg steps out of retirement and into the leadership role that many once expected him to play at RTX, one of Boeing’s biggest suppliers and the parent to enginemaker Pratt & Whitney. He briefly ran Collins Aerospace before shifting to an advisory role and eventually RTX’s board in 2020.At Rockwell Collins, Ortberg had a track record as dealmaker — striking his first major acquisition just 11 days after taking over as CEO. He was known for his blunt, no-nonsense style and his effort to flatten hierarchy.“Kelly is an experienced leader who is deeply respected in the aerospace industry,” said Boeing Chairman Steve Mollenkopf, who led the search for the new CEO. Boeing said it waived the mandatory retirement age of 65 for Ortberg, as it did in 2021 for Calhoun.Ortberg was the rare executive to openly criticize Boeing at a time when the US planemaker held huge sway over its subcontractors. Ortberg called out the manufacturer as “delinquent” in 2016, after it abruptly switched payment terms from 30 days to as long as four months, squeezing working capital for its suppliers.He eventually joined the consolidation wave, selling the Cedar Rapids, Iowa-based aerospace company to United Technologies Corp., which later combined with Raytheon Technologies Corp, now RTX. At the time, it was the biggest acquisition in aviation history.Boeing picked Ortberg as it works through one of the most tumultuous periods in the company’s history. In January, a fuselage panel blew out of an almost-new 737 Max 9 airliner during flight, which investigators attributed to missing bolts in the so-called door plug segment.While nobody was seriously hurt in the accident, it set off a cascade of developments, from Calhoun’s departure to a regulatory clampdown to Boeing pleading guilty to felony charges connected to two previous accidents.Calhoun will continue to serve as special adviser until March 2025. As part of his decision to step down, Boeing also named Stephanie Pope as new head of its commercial aviation business earlier this year. Pope, 52, was seen as the most promising internal candidate for the CEO job.“Boeing overall has a long road ahead if the underperformance in this quarter is an indicator of what’s to come,” said Ron Epstein, an analyst at BofA Securities Inc.","Boeing appoints Kelly Ortberg as its next chief executive officer.
