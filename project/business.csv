Will Indian IT companies be forced to exit H-1B visa program? Steep fee hike to make significant dent in pockets,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/will-indian-it-companies-be-forced-to-exit-h1-b-visa-program-steep-fee-hike-to-make-significant-dent-in-pockets/articleshow/110379349.cms,"H1-B Visa Fee Hike

The US H-1B visa fee hike has raised concerns among industry representatives and immigration experts, who warn that it could pose significant challenges for Indian IT service providers and strain their finances.Indian IT companies heavily depend on H-1B visas to bring thousands of highly skilled professionals to the US to fill specialty positions that are in high demand but short supply in the country, according to an ET report by Annapurna Roy.In April, the USCIS implemented substantial fee increases for various immigration processes . The H-1B visa registration fee saw a staggering 2050% increase, rising from $10 to $215, while the application fee increased by 70%, from $460 to $780. Additionally, a $600 asylum fee was introduced for filing H-1B and other petitions, which experts argue is unrelated to non-immigrant work visas like H-1B.""The drastic percentage increase and added asylum fee all at once makes things difficult,"" said Shivendra Singh, vice president - global trade and development at industry association Nasscom .According to an analysis by the National Foundation for American Policy, the visa fee hikes could result in employers spending over $33,000 in legal and government fees for each H-1B visa petition filed for initial employment or employment extension.Jonathan Wasden, managing attorney at immigration litigation firm Wasden Law, warned that the new rules might force Indian IT companies to withdraw from the visa process altogether.Unlike product companies such as Apple and Google, or banking institutions that may only file one H-1B petition every three years, these IT firms are likely to incur significantly higher costs due to the need to file petitions more frequently.Also Read | Why Indian IT’s reliance on H-1B work visas has plunged 56% in the last 8 years Wasden believes that this is a deliberate attempt by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services to eliminate Indian IT companies from the H-1B program, stating, ""It is no secret to anyone who practices employment-based business immigration that USCIS has been trying for decades to eliminate Indian IT companies from the H-1B program. This is merely the latest tactic to achieve this goal,"" Wasden told ET. ""They are trying to make the process so expensive for companies doing third-party placement that they will go out of business,"" he added.Wasden represents US industry body IT Serve Alliance, one of the plaintiffs challenging the fee rule in court.Nasscom also expressed concerns about the impact of the fee hikes on their member companies. Shivendra Singh says that the increase in filing fees comes at a time when there is a significant demand-supply gap in skills availability. He warned that any measure that complicates and raises the cost of addressing this gap could have a substantial impact on the ease of doing business and adversely affect the competitiveness of the US economy.Also Read | Why Infosys’ Narayana Murthy wants to be remembered ‘not as a good man but…’ In addition to the fee hikes, Singh pointed out that the proposed modernisation rule provisions, which aim to narrow the criteria for 'specialty occupation' and H-1B employees staffed at third parties, could have serious consequences if implemented in the future.While some experts believe that the fee hikes will lead to a decrease in the use of H-1B visas over time, others suggest that companies will continue to bear the costs to secure the skills they desperately need. Cyrus Mehta, managing partner at immigration law firm Cyrus D Mehta & Partners PLLC, noted that Indian heritage companies have started to absorb the fee increase, viewing it as a cost of doing business in the US.However, he also cautioned that the fee increase could become a burden, particularly for India-born workers caught up in green card backlogs, as H-1B extensions will need to be filed repeatedly on their behalf.","In April, the USCIS implemented substantial fee increases for various immigration processes. The H-1B visa registration fee saw a staggering 2050% increase, rising from $10 to $215. The application fee increased by 70%, from $460 to $780.

Goldilocks scenario for gold! Why it’s the right time to buy gold,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/goldilocks-scenario-for-gold-why-its-the-right-time-to-buy-gold/articleshow/110381856.cms,"Gold Funds

Gold price outlook : The current circumstances appear to be ideal for gold, and overlooking its appeal could be a costly mistake for investors seeking to safeguard their wealth.Central banks in emerging markets are accumulating gold reserves as tensions persist in West Asia, enhancing the metal's status as a reliable store of value. Additionally, the near certainty of an extended pause in US interest rates further bolsters the case for gold, says an ET analysis by Prashant Mahesh.Tapan Patel, fund manager - commodities at Tata Asset Management, advises, ""Investors could increase their allocation to gold from 8-10% to 10-15%, over the next three months, given the positive outlook for gold.""Gold prices have experienced a significant upswing in recent times, outperforming the Nifty 50 over a 5-year period with a return of 17.39% compared to the Nifty's 15.24%. However, gold underperformed over a 10-year period, yielding a return of 9.02% against the Nifty 50's 13.3%. In the last three months, gold prices have surged by 19%, and over the past year, they have risen by 22.8%.Financial advisors highlight several factors that could drive gold prices higher and recommend that investors accumulate the precious metal during any price dips in the coming three months.The US Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased by 0.3% in April, following advances of 0.4% in March and February. This suggests that inflation has resumed its downward trend at the beginning of the second quarter.Ghazal Jain, a fund manager at Quantum Mutual Fund, warns that any escalation in geopolitical tensions, fiscal or monetary measures to bolster the economy before the US elections, and the recently announced deceleration in Fed balance sheet reductions could adversely affect inflation, maintaining gold's relevance.Also Read | When will gold prices hit the Rs 2 lakh mark? Patel adds that gold prices will remain robust due to significant purchases by central banks, particularly China, Turkey, and Russia. The Ukraine invasion raised concerns about the risks associated with US dollar exposure for many nations.As a result, central banks globally are actively accumulating gold to diversify their reserves and reduce their reliance on the US dollar. In China, retail investors are also purchasing gold, further increasing demand for the precious metal. Prior to 2020, when the Chinese government cracked down on real estate, it was one of the most favored forms of savings for retail investors. With the local property market falling out of favor, investors have shifted their focus to gold.Also Read | Gold prices surge! Why 9-Carat gold jewellery may now be hallmarked Anup Bhaiya, managing director of Money Honey Financial Services, advises, ""Retail investors could stagger their bets in 3-4 tranches using a buy on dip strategy, instead of buying at one go.""He suggests that investors in higher tax brackets could use a combination of sovereign gold bonds and multi-asset funds to build their exposure in a tax-efficient manner, while those whose income is not subject to tax could opt for gold ETFs or gold funds. Some multi-asset funds are taxed as equity funds, while others are eligible for capital gains tax with indexation benefits if held for three years.","Central banks in emerging markets are accumulating gold reserves as tensions persist in West Asia.

The group has repeatedly denied those allegations.The flagship’s stock rose 1.7% to 3,445.05 in Mumbai on Friday and has now almost tripled since its nadir in February 2023. The latest upswing comes as some analysts expect Adani Enterprises’ stock to be included in the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex Index in June, potentially bringing passive flows.Other Adani companies are engaging with global investors to raise fresh debt as the group pushes ahead with plans to expand its cement and copper businesses. Besides Adani Enterprises, at least five of the 10 listed Adani group stocks are trading above the levels seen before the Hindenburg report .“There are a handful of groups in India that can undertake big projects and Adani Group has taken the leadership position,” said Abhay Agarwal, a fund manager with Mumbai-based Piper Serica Advisors Pvt. “Investors are looking at Adani group as a policy play and since there is a clear direction on the country’s policy, we are seeing recovery.”Shares of Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd. and Adani Power Ltd. have been among the best performers this year among the group companies, adding more than 35% each while television broadcaster New Delhi Television Ltd. has been the biggest laggard, giving away 5.5%.Back in January 2023, the short seller Hindenburg’s bombshell report saw Adani Enterprises scrap a $2.4 billion equity offering — which was then poised to be India’s largest follow-on share sale — amid a stock meltdown that at one point eroded more than $150 billion from the group’s market value. It also wrecked the personal wealth of Gautam Adani while the short seller’s claims set off regulatory probes in India.The group is now less than $30 billion away from returning to the market value it commanded on the eve of the short seller report.The first leg of the recovery in Adani stocks came in March last year after star emerging-market investor Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners bought shares worth almost $2 billion in four of the group firms, including the flagship, from an Adani family trust. Jain added to his positions through 2023.

MUMBAI: The rupee hit a two-month high to close at 83.10 in the foreign exchange market on Friday, up 14 paise from its previous close of 83.24.

The rupee gained nearly 0.3 per cent this week - its biggest weekly gain in over five months. Dealers said that the currency gained as there were some chunky inflows of dollars in the foreign exchange market. Market sentiment also improved after the recent surge in equity indices, which came on the back of an announcement of a record Rs 2.1 lakh crore dividend by RBI to govt. The delayed reaction to the news was because foreign exchange markets were closed on Thursday due to Buddha Purnima.

""Despite the dollar index trading higher in recent days, the rupee showed resilience due to significant economic development in India,"" said Jateen Trivedi, research analyst at LKP Securities.

The finance minister set the stage for a ""Viksit Bharat by 2047"", on the core principles of ‘Sabka Saath’, ‘Sabka Vikas’, ‘Sabka Vishwas’, with ‘Sabka Prayas’ being added as a new theme in the interim Budget.This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data i.e., farmer welfare and N for Nari utthan i.e., support for women entrepreneurs.These form the pillars of a comprehensive inclusive development. The Government's commitment to sustainable development under the strategy for Amrit Kaal includes achieving 'Net Zero' by 2070, rooftop solarization for one crore households and robust health initiatives.The Indian economy's resilience takes center stage amidst positive indicators of declining current account deficit as a percentage of GDP, falling unemployment rates, and a notable rise in digital transactions. These statistics affirm the robustness of the economy, showcasing a trajectory of growth and stability.The achievements in taxation reforms are nothing short of remarkable, with direct tax collections more than trebling in the last decade, the number of tax return filers increasing by 2.4 times, average processing time of tax returns plummeting from 93 days in FY 2013-14 to an impressive 10 days in FY 2023-24, resulting in issuance of quick refunds. These are the results of consistent progressive measures thus obviating the need for, and rightly avoiding, any last-minute populist measures.No change in existing tax rates, both for direct and indirect taxes, is a good indicator of stability and predictability for investors and taxpayers.A welcome move to waive outstanding tax demands that are minor, disputed, and unreconciled. This involves the withdrawal of outstanding direct tax demands up to Rs. 25,000 pertaining to the period up to FY 2009-10 and up to Rs.10,000 for FY 2010-11 to 2014-15.The Government's commitment to fostering a business-friendly environment is evident in its intent to extend specific tax benefits for start-ups, investments by sovereign wealth funds/ pension funds, and certain IFSC units. The extension has been made now until March 31, 2025. This might help in creating a conducive landscape for business.To align with the CBDT notification issued earlier, the provisions relating to tax collection at source concerning remittances under the Liberalized Remittance Scheme have now been formally incorporated in the Finance Bill, 2024, setting the rate at 20% for amounts exceeding Rs. 7 lakhs in a financial year.The Finance Bill, 2024 proposes an extension of the time limit for introducing the faceless scheme by the Central Government for transfer pricing proceedings, DRP Proceedings, and ITAT Proceedings, up to March 31, 2025.The interim Budget 2024 may not have proposed significant tax announcements, but it very well positioned the prelude to the full budget post the upcoming elections. Considering the potential impact on the population across the four pillars of GYAN, a sizable portion of India stands to be covered. The interim Budget’s focus on the tax front resembles a report card, highlighting the maturity achieved by our tax system. The enhancement of taxpayer services was emphasized as a key priority.","This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data and N for Nari utthan.

At first glance, it did not seem like an interim budget but looked more like the budget to drive further growth and a continuum of inclusive growth-oriented investments.At the outset, this budget brings a wonderful balance between fiscal prudence and continued investment for growth.It's not easy to continue the glide path of reducing the fiscal deficit and continuing to make significant investments in all areas including infrastructure, R&D, energy transition, technology, skilling, and social welfare. The surprising reduction in fiscal deficit of 5.8% as against the budgeted 5.9% for FY24 and the projection of 5.1% in FY25 with a clear focus on increasing investments was a huge positive.This was a budget for everyone and all because it caters to every part of the Indian economy and society. The FM has carefully catered to the investment needs of various sectors. The continued focus on youth, impoverished, women and farmers to increase their involvement and contribution to economic growth is evident. By committing an 11.1% increase in capital expenditure to 11,11,111 lakh crore, the FM has clearly brought every single 1 in this growth journey.What was very impressive was the inclusion strategy of the government. The focus on women's empowerment for the past few years is unprecedented, which is reflected in the inclusion of women in the workforce moving from 23.3% to 37% in the last five years. The thirty crore Mudra Yojna loans to women entrepreneurs were a great boost to the Nari Shakti initiative. We already have over 10 million Lakhpati Didis and what is truly evident is like a corporate CFO, the FM has revised the earlier target of 20 million Lakhpati Didis to 30 million. The government also plans to invest in initiatives to encourage young girls between the ages of 9 and 14 to undertake the vaccination for cervical cancer which is again a great boost to Nari Shakti.A lot needs to be done to bring more women into all parts of economic growth but the journey so far and the vision of the future is truly inspiring.While India continues on its technological prowess and makes its mark in new technologies like Artificial Intelligence, we need a multi-pronged strategy to harness the power of AI. We need a clear focus on building AI systems in India so that we not only emerge as a global leader in this new era but can build models, which are specific to India that will benefit Indians. At the same time, we need a very wide coverage program to build skills to leverage AI to its fullest potential. The biggest contribution we can make to the inclusion of youth in the economic development of the country is by skilling them in new skill areas. In the last few years, the Skill India Mission has trained 14 million youth, reskilled over 5 million youth and established a staggering 3,000 new ITIs. The future of any country will depend as much on capital investments as on skill investments.The focus on agricultural development and support to the farmer continues through direct financial assistance to farmers. The farmers have benefited by getting crop insurance through PM Fasal Bima Yojana. It's not just the farmers, the PM-SVANidhi provides credit assistance to a large number of street vendors.The last few years have seen the journey of affordable housing through Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY). There is a slight increase in allocation to launch a scheme for encouraging the middle class to build or buy new homes. This investment will likely propel a wider economic development and increase employment.India has seen a tremendous rise in entrepreneurship in the last few years. In order to continue the journey and promote new startups, the government proposes to extend certain tax benefits, which are expiring from March 2024 to March 2025. The MSMEs have not been left behind. With a proposal to provide timely finances to such enterprises, the government has paved the way for their growth, so they can look to compete globally.All in all, it’s a truly inclusive budget with a clear focus on development not just by giving away freebies but enabling the people to participate in the economic development activity. While the FM calls the comprehensive GDP - Governance, Development & Performance – to me, this budget is inclusive of another GDP – gender, demography, and professions.","Akhilesh Tuteja is Partner and Head, Clients and Markets, KPMG in India.

‘Enough domestic sources of demand to counter drag from external sector’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/enough-domestic-sources-of-demand-to-counter-drag-from-external-sector/articleshow/107372012.cms,"Do you think the

creates room for lower interest rates?

One of the issues that the Budget has flagged is the demographic challenge and opportunity and the societal change that is taking place. How do you view this?

Niti Aayog is working on the Viksit Bharat roadmap. What will be the focus areas?

You are as much a representative of the Centre as well as the states. Is it time to revisit the entire formula for transfers to states particularly on the issue of cesses and surcharges?

Suman Bery , who heads Niti Aayog , the govt think tank, is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China, which he says is also an opportunity for India. The economist is confident that Indian states remain resilient. Excerpts of the interview with TOI.The finance ministry expects the economy to grow 7% next year.Given the global situation, how do you see the prospects?The belief in the finance ministry is that we have a possible drag coming from the external sector but that we have other sources. We have enough domestic sources of demand. One has to applaud the political and economic judgment of FM in deciding that it was appropriate to pursue the path of fiscal consolidation. There is transparency. What this actually reflects is responsible economic management, which is one reason we are where we are. Second, it also creates a buffer so that there is policy space if we do encounter headwinds.That’s the hope and expectation. We have an independent central bank and an inflation targeting central bank, so it is up to the monetary policy committee to take a call through the monetary policy committee on the repo rate .The PM has said that when India grows its states grow. India is a composite of 37 states and UTs. They are each at very different points in their demographic transition. There are some states where the net replacement rate is down to 1%, like Kerala . There are others, particularly UP and Bihar, which are in their earliest stage of demographic transition and each one of these states is the size of a large European country. There are two implications of that — one is internal labour mobility and it will become an even larger part of our growth model. The govt has taken several steps to create a unified market. Our main endowment is our human capital and that has to be equipped to participate in global exchange in many ways. We know from China, Japan that the demographic dividend partly depends on markets and on human capital. But the golden period is fairly short lived, about 15 years, when the so called dependency ratio declines. The other big opportunity the PM has been highlighting is bringing women much more into the active labour force.When Niti was set up there was the idea of a three-year vision and a seven-year strategy paper. The reality is that schemes of govt tend to be aligned with the award of the Finance Commission . There are various established building blocks or hand holds which are already a matter of govt policy. The PM is much more interested in a national debate on what it means to be a Viksit Bharat or modern society. We have a collective goal and it is for the democratic polity to define what that goal should be. Its emphatically not for a super mandarin bureaucracy. It is not going to be Lee Kwan Yew’s Singapore led from the top.It’s entirely a finance ministry matter but I would be lying if I didn’t say when I visit certain states there is this complaint. A big frontier would be resource mobilisation at the state level. Second is going to be rationalisation of subsidies not only at the Union level, but also at the state level. All chief ministers sit on my governing council. When they convene as the governing council, I see them in their role as development practitioners. The world is beginning to appreciate quite how much institutional and political maturity India attained in our 75 years and the most fundamental dimension of a democracy, we have orderly transfers of power. There are enough buffers to ensure that what happens in state finances is unlikely to create macro instability. Those risks are well contained by our Constitution. The chief ministers know that they are going to be judged by development outcomes and so you can have the sugar rush of changing of pension plans or various handouts but if the cupboard is bare you are not going to be able to deliver.","Suman Bery is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China.

Government's Marathon to 2047: Emphasis on Fiscal Prudence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/governments-marathon-to-2047-emphasis-on-fiscal-prudence/articleshow/107371788.cms,"What was the thinking behind keeping the vote on account absolutely straight?

So is it the idea to keep the Budget completely transparent?

The capex has risen 11.1% and there is an emphasis on infrastructure spending. But there is also the hope that the private sector will now take over and start capital spending. Given the geopolitical situation, how confident is the govt that it will pan out as planned?

Finance secretary T V Somanathan, in an interview with TOI, says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047 . Excerpts:If you see the Budget speech you will see the emphasis on 2047. The govt has set its sight on running that marathon.Running to 2047 is a marathon , it’s not a sprint. If you are going to run a marathon, you need to be in good shape and you can’t have short-term stimulants or something that will get you some yards and then it’s done.The whole focus is on making India a developed country by 2047, for which a healthy present and a strong fiscal position is an important concomitant. Some purely short term measures don’t really fit into that picture. It’s a consistent picture: focus on the long term for which you need to build strength in the short term and that needs to be done by prudence in fiscal policy and by not doing things which can detract you from that path. Not doing the wrong thing is more important than appearing to do things.The idea is that govt finances may be good, bad or indifferent depending on the times, depending on the circumstances, depending on the policies. But what is the position should be reflected as reasonably and accurately as possible. That is an emphasis. As regards the Finance Commission, again the terms of reference that have been given to them are the terms in the Constitution.What is the means by which the devolution should be done is a matter they have full discretion. They can actually take all kinds of factors into account and in a sense we felt this time based on my review of the previous commissions that the right expression would be less is more. The shorter, less prescriptive terms of reference gives full scope for all stakeholders including state govts to express their viewpoints and for the commission to take a balanced view of the different perspectives and then come to its award. Ultimately the award of the Finance Commission is about devolution and grant for which full scope has now been given to them.n There are incipient signs of private capital expenditure accelerating. There are some surveys I have seen done by some of the chambers industry, which show high levels of investment. The PMI, which is a sort of leading indicator, is also looking pretty healthy. Capacity utilisation is one reason that private sector capital expenditure doesn’t immediately pick up when the economy starts accelerating because there is surplus capacity.But increasingly I get the sense that many industries are beginning to reach levels where they have to add capacity. When that happens capital investment will happen. Another pointer also mentioned in the Budget speech you may notice that our airlines have placed large orders for planes — that is capital expenditure.When you import 1,000 aircraft, it’s just not 1,000 aircraft, there are concomitant additions to ground handling facilities, you need airports to expand, you need to employ people to do that. That means a lot of jobs. The aircraft is capital but then look at the effect it is going to have on skilled jobs. So capital expenditure is happening. I am fairly confident that we will have decent capital expenditure in the year to come and that will become a new source of acceleration.",Finance secretary T V Somanathan says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047.

What is the Section 80C limit for tax deduction for FY 2024-25 after Interim Budget 2024?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/income-tax-budget-2024-2024-2025-section-80c-limit-epf-ppf-elss-nsc/articleshow/107353021.cms,"ALSO READ |

Income Tax Changes Budget 2024 : In the recent Budget 2024 speech, the Finance Minister kept the Section 80C tax deduction limit unchanged. The maximum limit for claiming tax benefits under Section 80C remains at Rs 1.5 lakh for the current fiscal year 2023-24 and will stay the same for individuals looking to save on taxes through Section 80C investments in the upcoming fiscal year 2024-25.Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions. Individuals can reduce their gross taxable income by up to Rs 1.5 lakh per financial year by engaging in these specific investments or expenditures.You can save on taxes through Section 80C by investing in things like Employees' Provident Fund (EPF), Public Provident Fund (PPF), Equity Linked Saving Scheme (ELSS) mutual funds, National Savings Certificate (NSC), and 5-year tax-saving fixed deposits with banks or post offices. Additionally, paying life insurance policy premiums also qualifies for tax benefits under Section 80C.It is important to note that each eligible investment comes with its specific maximum limit, rate of return, liquidity, and taxation rules for the earned returns, states ET in a report. For instance, the most you can invest in PPF in a financial year is Rs 1.5 lakh. Meanwhile, there's no limit on the amount you can invest in ELSS mutual funds, but the Section 80C deduction is capped at Rs 1.5 lakh.If individuals can't make specific investments, they can still get deductions under Section 80C from their gross taxable income through certain expenses. These expenses include repaying the principal amount of a home loan, tuition fees for children, payment of stamp duty, registration fees, and other costs related to buying a house.Since the financial year 2020-21, individuals without any business income must annually choose between the old and new tax regimes. As of the fiscal year 2023-24, the new tax regime is the default option. Consequently, individuals seeking tax deductions under Section 80C must opt for the old tax regime since this deduction isn't available in the new tax regime. It's crucial for taxpayers to be aware of these rules to make informed decisions about their tax planning and investment strategies.","Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget which is an interim budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year. The budget talks about inclusive development both, social and geographical, especially for youth, women, farmers, and the poor. Continued focus on improving logistics through infrastructure spend on roads, rail, airports, ports increases productivity for companies and citizens alike.To make ‘Viksit Bharat’ by 2047, the government’s focus is on improving and empowering people’s capabilities through various skilling initiatives. It is encouraging to see that Skill India Mission has succeeded in training more than 1.4 crore youth and upskilling and reskilling 54 lakh youth. I am particularly happy to see the continued focus on youth and women entrepreneurship and the announcement of a new fund which will give interest free 50 year loans for startups will provide a domestic fillip to startups supplementing venture capital we have traditionally relied on from abroad.PM Mudra Yojana has sanctioned 43 crore loans aggregating to 22.5 lakh crore to youth entrepreneurs and thirty crore Mudra Yojana loans to women entrepreneurs. There are several other schemes like Fund of Funds, Start-Up India, and Start-Up Credit Guarantee schemes that are assisting our youth. Further, the extension of tax benefits to Start-ups and investments made by sovereign wealth funds/pension funds, till 31st March 2025 depicts the government’s effort to support the startup eco- system.This aligns quite well with India Sanitation Coalition’s efforts to give impetus to the start-up world. Over the past 7 editions of our ISC-FICCI Sanitation Awards, we have recognized and promoted several start-ups in the sanitation space, many of whom are successful businesses now!While the finance minister did not provide detailed information on Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH), the budget allocation sees a slight increase in spend demonstrating continued focus on this highly successful program. The acknowledgement that the private sector has increasingly played a substantial role in addressing WASH issues in both urban and rural areas, with numerous projects underway through Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs), highlights the government's commitment to addressing challenges in this sector.A perfect example is the LightHouse Initiative initiated by the Department of Drinking Water along with the India Sanitation Coalition (ISC) by partnering with major corporates across India to develop model villages in Solid and Liquid Waste Management (SLWM) under SBM-Grameen. From this budget, there is an expectation that the government will persist in prioritizing Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) as the path toward achieving the country's Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6). Additionally, it is hoped that the government will uphold its commitment to making necessary infrastructural investments for SLWM.The budget speech rightly celebrates the fact that we have 83 lakh SHGs and 9 crore women beneficiaries. The microfinance movement in the country and the possibility of empowering women members of SHGs through livelihood skilling is a key to bringing women into mainstream economic advancement.The focus on green growth, rooftop solar, wind, biomass, e-vehicles all help with our green energy thrust. The tourism sector was mentioned and could be a huge job provider for youth and women.Guided by the principle ‘Reform, Perform, and Transform’, the budget emphasizes efficient implementation of various policies by improving coordination with states and relevant stakeholders. This is critical both for infra spend and social programsIt is noteworthy that ISC’s Climate Resilient Coastal Cities project which is being implemented in PPP (Public-Private Partnership) mode in four coastal states of Karnataka, Gujarat, Goa and Maharashtra is congruent with the government’s priority of promoting climate-resilient activities for the blue economy 2.0, a scheme for restoration and adaptation measures, and coastal aquaculture.The budget also focuses on the Aspirational districts program where assistance will be given to the states for faster development of aspirational districts and blocks, including the generation of ample economic opportunities. This is again very crucial as it has a huge potential to transform the landscape of our country while making sure no -one is left behind.Overall, this budget has embraced economic strategies and develops the building blocks that nurture and uphold growth, promote inclusive and sustainable development, and enhance productivity.","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year.

Sebi tweaks derivative scrips' price band norms,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sebi-tweaks-derivative-scrips-price-band-norms/articleshow/110408977.cms,"NEW DELHI: Sebi on Friday modified guidelines for dynamic price bands for scrips in the derivatives segment in a bid to strengthen volatility management and minimise information asymmetry .

For scrips excluded from the requirement of price bands, a mechanism of dynamic price bands (or operating range) has been implemented by stock exchanges.

Currently, cash market and futures contracts start with a price band at 10 per cent of the previous day's closing price, which can be adjusted by 5 per cent during the day if there are at least 25 trades involving 5 unique client codes (UCCs) on each side at or above 9.9 per cent. A 15-minute cooling-off period follows each adjustment, during which trading continues within the current band.

Based on feedback, Sebi has modified these rules, enhancing the conditions to 50 trades, 10 unique UCCs, and 3 trading members on each side for adjustments, according to its circular. When conditions for adjusting the price bands are met in either the cash market or current month futures contracts on any exchange, the price band will be adjusted for the scrip and all its futures contracts across all exchanges after the cooling-off period.

KOLKATA: A Bangladesh MP who came to Kolkata earlier this month for medical treatment and then went missing has been murdered . Bangladesh home minister Asaduzzaman Khan said at a press conference in Dhaka on Wednesday that three persons had been arrested in Bangladesh for the murder of Anwarul Azim Anar , 56, in Kolkata. The MP's body, however, has not been found yet.""Azim was murdered in a planned manner in a house in Kolkata. Police forces of both India and Bangladesh are working simultaneously to unearth the motive behind the murder and who the culprits are. We are following all international protocols to get to the bottom of this,"" Khan said, adding that ""people of our country are involved in the killing"". Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina expressed shock at Azim's death and conveyed her condolences to the family.A three-time Awami League MP who represented Jhenaidah-4 in Khulna division of Bangladesh, Azim had reached Kolkata on May 12 and put up with long-term associate Gopal Biswas in his house in north Kolkata's Sinthi. According to Biswas, he left the next day in a car saying he was going for a medical check-up but did not return. Over the next two days, Biswas and Azim's daughter in Bangladesh received text messages from Azim saying he was in Delhi on work. But when they failed to get in touch with him in the next 48 hours, Biswas filed a missing complaint at Baranagar police station on May 18. The Barrackpore Police Commissionerate formed a special investigation team to trace the politician. On May 20, an external affairs ministry input said the MP had possibly been murdered.Bidhannagar Police on Wednesday said the MP was murdered in an upscale gated community with duplex flats near Aquatica in New Town. The flat is owned by an employee of the state excise department, Sanjib Ghosh, who had rented it out to one Akhtaruzzaman, a US national.A team of officials from Bidhannagar and Barrackpore Police Commissionerates, the STF and central agencies reached the New Town flat on Wednesday morning to conduct a search. They found blood stains but there was no body. CCTV footage showed Anar entering the housing complex with two men and a woman on May 13 but he was not seen exiting. The two men and the women were seen exiting at different times between May 13 and 15 - two of them were seen leaving with big bags. Akhilesh Chaturvedi, IG of state CID, confirmed that police were yet to recover the MP's body.Biswas said in the missing diary that Anar sent him a message on May 13 claiming he was travelling to Delhi. On May 15, he texted to say he had reached Delhi and was with VIPs and so would not be able to speak to him. According to Biswas, Anar's daughter Mumtarim Firdaus Dorin and personal assistant also received similar messages.""There was a call from the MP's phone to his PA on May 16. His PA could not take the call at that moment but when he rang back, the MP's phone was unavailable. Anar's daughter, concerned about her father becoming incommunicado, called me on May 17. The next day I filed the missing complaint,"" Biswas said.Bangladeshi newspaper 'Daily Star' quoted the country's home minister as saying that they were on the lookout for a few more persons involved in the murder.","Bangladeshi MP Anwarul Azim Anar, 56, murdered in Kolkata.

The company claims to have worked with the NLRB to adhere to guidelines throughout the election process and will continue to do so.The union's filing alleges that four pro-union employees were fired, and the company allowed anti-union employees to solicit support during work hours while prohibiting pro-union employees from doing the same. The company also required workers to attend anti-union meetings, displayed anti-union propaganda, and prohibited the distribution of union materials in non-work areas.Furthermore, the union claims that the company, or its representatives, polled workers about union support, suggested that voting for the union would be futile, targeted union supporters with drug tests, and ""engaged in conduct which deliberately sought to exacerbate racial feelings by irrelevant and inflammatory appeals to racial prejudice.""The NLRB will review the objections, and if it is determined that the employer's conduct affected the election, a new election could be ordered.","The United Auto Workers (UAW) has accused Mercedes of interfering with a union election at two factories in Alabama.

"Fliers are freaking out over safety after Boeing, Singapore air mishaps",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/fliers-are-freaking-out-over-safety-after-boeing-singapore-air-mishaps/articleshow/110385984.cms,"A spate of high-profile airline accidents this year have left a lasting impression on the public.There was the fiery Japan Airlines runway collision on January 2, followed days later by the Boeing Co door-plug blowout . From lost wheels to a turbulent Singapore Airlines flight this week, the headline-grabbing events have left the flying public to wonder whether it’s still safe to fly.The reality, statistics show, remains that getting on a Boeing or Airbus SE jetliner is still exponentially safer than the drive to the airport. Last year, there wasn’t a single fatality among the 37 million commercial airline flights.While 2024 won’t match that record, it’s been an average year in terms of airline safety. Yet public perception remains jittery. US web searches for “flight safety” hit the highest level in March since October 2014, according to Google Trends.That year a decade ago was a particularly bad one for aviation fatalities. The disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 in March was followed by the shooting down of the same carrier’s Flight 17 over Ukraine in July and an AirAsia crash in December.The accidents this year have caused far fewer fatalities than in early 2014 or in 2019, when the second of two Boeing 737 Max flights crashed in March, killing 157 people in Ethiopia.Five people aboard a Japan Coast Guard turboprop lost their lives in early January when the plane ventured onto the runway path of an incoming Airbus A350. While nobody died in the Jan. 5 structural failure of a 737 Max 9 operated by Alaska Air Group Inc., the accident dealt a serious blow to Boeing’s credibility and to passenger confidence.Since then, a series of more minor incidents, from a Delta Air Lines Inc Boeing 757 losing a nose wheel to a United Airlines Holdings Inc. 737 Max skidding off a runway in Houston, have received widespread media coverage.On the flight from London to Singapore this week, a 73-year-old British man died from a suspected heart attack after the plane encountered severe turbulence.“There is reason for the public to be concerned but I think the concern is elevated because of the real focus that some news stations have given,” said John Goglia, an aviation safety expert and former member of the National Transportation Safety Board. “The wheel falling off the aeroplane never would have gone anywhere; in some local newspapers it may have been a one-inch column.”Indeed, government statistics indicate the US is having a fairly normal year.In the US, there were 11 accidents and incidents on commercial passenger or cargo flights in the first quarter, according to the NTSB database. That’s slightly above an average of 9.7 in the decade from 2010 to 2019. Serious cases stood at four in the quarter, slightly above the pre-Covid average of 3.3. The figures are based on cases the NTSB investigates, which include all accidents and only some incidents, so the numbers can vary.Meanwhile, the Federal Aviation Administration reported progress in one problem area. The rate of serious runway incursions in the first quarter decreased by 59% from the same period in 2023, a historically high year for such events. The current rate for 2024 is below the annual average of 0.31 per 1 million aircraft operations over the last decade, according to data provided to Bloomberg.“Aviation is the safest way to travel and that’s because we never take anything for granted,” said the FAA, which is responsible for airline safety in the US. “We are always looking for risk and ways to mitigate it.”The extended spotlight on Boeing has brought significant attention to the planemaker, with some fliers filtering out its 737 Max jets. Yet many of the incidents have occurred with older planes, and are more likely to be traced back to an airline maintenance or operational issue than the original design or build quality.“In this environment, any operational event no matter how routine can get outsize attention,” Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun said at the company’s May 17 annual meeting.Many of the events which have worried fliers this year, from landing gear collapsing to pilots overshooting runways, are classified as incidents rather than the more serious “accident,” which the International Civil Aviation Organization defines as involving a person being fatally or seriously injured, the aircraft sustaining damage requiring repairs or the aircraft going missing.That doesn’t mean there aren’t improvements to be made, according to Loren Groff, the chief data scientist at the NTSB. He pointed to the work being done to improve staffing and training for air-traffic controllers after some recent errors and near-collisions on runways.“Overall, it’s amazing that the US aviation system, and most of the world in general, can do something so complex so successfully,” Groff said. “Would I be afraid of aviation in any way? No, absolutely not.”","A spate of high-profile airline accidents have left a lasting impression on the public. US web searches for “flight safety’ hit the highest level in March since October 2014.

His continual share purchases over the past year as well as expectations that Hanmi Semi will be added to the blue-chip Kospi 200 Index in the June review have been two additional positive catalysts for the stock.“It’s very unique that the CEO keeps buying shares,” said Ahn Hyunsang, chief executive officer at Korea Investment Research Institute. “The stock is very expensive based on the price-to-earnings ratio, so I’m not sure if there are any more legs to this rally.”Hanmi Semiconductor is trading at around 80 times estimate earnings for the next year, more than all other stocks in the 40-member FactSet Asia Semiconductor Index.According to DS Asset’s Yoon, the company would need to make 1 trillion won ($730 billion) in annual net income to justify its current valuation.

The Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday paved the way for trading in exchange-traded funds that invest directly in the cryptocurrency Ether , putting the digital-asset industry on the cusp of a significant milestone.In a first-of-its-kind blessing, the SEC signed off on a proposal by venues run by Cboe Global Markets Inc., Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange to list products tied to the world’s second-biggest cryptocurrency. The move, which had seemed unlikely as recently as last week, removes a key hurdle for spot Ether ETF trading in the US. Issuers now need a separate sign-off from the regulator; no deadline has been set for that decision.Investment companies, including VanEck, ARK Investment Management, BlackRock Inc., and Fidelity Investments, are all vying for crucial first-mover advantage in the race to launch a spot Ether ETF. Their interest has been piqued by billions of dollars gushing into new Bitcoin ETFs since January when the SEC signed off on trading in those products.Shares of Coinbase gained as much as 4.1% in after-hours trading Thursday, while Robinhood shares rose nearly 3%. The crypto market response to the news was relatively muted - Ether traded around $3819.80 in the immediate aftermath of the releaseBeyond ETFs, the SEC’s announcement on Thursday is laced with US financial policy implications.SEC Chair Gary Gensler has been ambiguous on his views over whether Ether is a security, stoking concerns that the agency was hardening its stance. Crypto enthusiasts say they are worried about him trying to subject Ether — and potentially projects based on the Ethereum blockchain — to the agency’s tough, expensive and onerous investor-protection rules.Meanwhile, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the US’s other main market regulator with jurisdiction over derivatives, has signaled that it doesn’t consider Ether to be a security. The CFTC has for years allowed trading in Ether futures by CME Group Inc.As recently as last week, companies were banking the SEC would reject the Cboe plan — and potentially others — by Thursday’s deadline. Additional SEC approval is still needed for the issuers, but the signoff is a significant victory for the industry.Backers hope a listing will bring a new flood of money to the asset class by appealing to retail and institutional investors, who are interested in crypto but more comfortable investing in ETFs than tokens.Overall, investors, many who retreated after FTX exchange’s collapse, have already been piling back into crypto. Ether, the native token of the Ethereum blockchain, is up more than 60% this year alone thanks to the frenzy.Some of that rally is due to optimism that the US crackdown on the industry may be waning. The Republican-led House on Wednesday advanced sweeping cryptocurrency legislation despite opposition from the White House and Gensler. Although the Senate isn’t expected to approve the measure, it garnered some Democratic support in the House.On the jurisdictional question, Lee Reiners, policy director of the Duke Financial Economics Center at Duke University, said that exchange bids to list the products were based on Ether being a commodity and not a security. An SEC decision to green light the plan bolsters the view that the SEC still considers Ether not to be a security, he said.Investment companies seeking to list the products have already been making concessions to win SEC approval.Fidelity Investments said it will keep Ether it buys as part of the ETF out of programs that pay rewards for blockchain maintenance, known as staking. The latter has been a hot-button issue for Ether because it raises questions about whether the token should be treated as a security. Last year, the SEC in a lawsuit accused Coinbase Global Inc. of breaking its rules by offering staking services.",The Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday paved the way for trading in exchange-traded funds that invest directly in the cryptocurrency Ether.

Rare Rs 10 notes recovered from 1918 shipwreck to go under the hammer in London,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/two-10-rupee-notes-recovered-from-ss-shirala-to-go-under-the-hammer-in-mayfair/articleshow/110373472.cms,"(Photo credit: NOONANS)

LONDON: Two 10-rupee banknotes recovered from the wreck of the SS Shirala , which was sunk by a German U-boat on July 2, 1918, will be offered at the auction house Noonans in Mayfair next week as part of its sale of world banknotes.

Lots 474 and 475 are each estimated to fetch £2,000-2,600 (Rs 2.1 lakh to Rs 2.7 lakh) at the sale on May 29. Both are described as unsigned, on superb quality original paper, and very rare.

Thomasina Smith, worldwide head of numismatics at Noonans, said: “Whole blocks of these notes, along with lots of provisions ranging from marmalade to ammunition, were on their way to Bombay from London when the boat was sunk. Many notes floated to shore, including unsigned five and 10 rupees notes, and a signed one rupee one (which also features in this auction). Most were recovered and subsequently destroyed by the authorities and new ones were printed to replace them. However, a very few examples remained in private hands. These are in very good condition — they must have been in the middle of a tightly bound bundle, so didn’t make contact with the sea. It’s also wonderful that they bear consecutive serial numbers.”

BuzzFeed shares soar as Vivek Ramaswamy takes stake,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/buzzfeed-shares-soar-as-vivek-ramaswamy-takes-stake/articleshow/110370526.cms,"BuzzFeed Inc shares soared Wednesday after the entrepreneur and former US presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy reported a stake in the online media company and asked for talks with the board.Ramaswamy, a Republican who ended his candidacy in January and threw his support behind Donald Trump , has taken a 7.7% stake in BuzzFeed, worth about $6.81 million based on Tuesday’s closing share price. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Ramaswamy said he seeks to “engage in a dialogue with board or management about numerous operational and strategic opportunities to maximize shareholder value, including a shift in the company’s strategy.”The stock surged 20% to $3.01, the biggest gain since February 2024.Ramaswamy founded pharmaceutical company Roivant Sciences Ltd in 2014 and co-founded Strive Asset Management in 2022. He stepped away from the asset management firm last year to focus on his presidential run and has said he isn’t returning. Ramaswamy’s position in BuzzFeed marks his latest move since ending his political campaign, and his interest in BuzzFeed raises questions about the direction of the company. “Stay tuned,” Ramaswamy said through a spokesperson when asked for comment about his investment.“BuzzFeed is purposely structured to protect its editorial integrity,” a spokesperson for the company said in a statement. “We are always open to hearing ideas from our shareholders.”Strive Asset Management is an anti-activism fund, which has pushed companies to stay out of “woke” politics and has pressured about a dozen companies to end compensation incentives for environmental and social goals. The purchase makes Ramaswamy the fourth largest shareholder in BuzzFeed, trailing Comcast Corp, NEA Management Co and Hearst Communications Inc.BuzzFeed, known for its online quizzes, lists of “bests” and articles on pop culture, has struggled in recent years due to cutbacks in internet advertising. The company went public in 2021 in a volatile debut and the shares have fallen about 92% since then. Last year, the company eliminated its news division amid broader layoffs and in quarterly results released last week BuzzFeed said it expects revenue to decline 21% to 30% in the current quarter. That’s after an 18% decline in sales in the first three months.To address its capital needs, the company said in a separate securities filing last week that it “may explore options to restructure its outstanding debt, and is working with advisers to optimize its condensed consolidated balance sheet.” Last week, BuzzFeed announced changes that would tie compensation of Chief Executive Officer Jonah Peretti and other executives to the company’s stock performance.Earlier this year BuzzFeed said it would sell media company Complex for $108.6 million and reduce its remaining workforce by 16%.","Vivek Ramaswamy reported a 7.7% stake in BuzzFeed, worth about $6.81 million.

Stock market alert: JP Morgan predicts major decline for S&P 500,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/stock-market-alert-jp-morgan-predicts-major-decline-for-sp-500/articleshow/110369276.cms,"NEW DELHI: JP Morgan has issued a stark warning about the US stock market , predicting a significant drop in the S&P 500 by the end of the year. The bank's chief market strategist , Marko Kolanovic, projects the index to fall to 4,200, marking the lowest year-end target among major Wall Street banks. This forecast implies a more than 21% decline from current levels.""With very high equity valuations, we do not see equities as attractive investments at the moment, and we don't see a reason to change our stance,"" Kolanovic wrote in an analyst note this week. This pessimistic outlook is one of the most severe on Wall Street, a Fox News report said.Despite recent record highs, including the Dow Jones Industrial Average surpassing 40,000 for the first time and the S&P 500 reaching over 5,300, Kolanovic suggests these gains are unlikely to last. He cites several factors contributing to the bearish forecast, including sustained high interest rates, signs of persistent inflation, evidence of financial strain among lower-income consumers, and increasing geopolitical uncertainties.Kolanovic also pointed out that the recent boost from artificial intelligence developments is unlikely to counterbalance these traditional market challenges. ""We don't think that narrow themes like AI chips can compensate for all of those traditional market challenges that historically worked against the cycle,"" he said.This gloomy forecast follows a volatile year for the stock market. All three major indexes experienced significant declines in mid-2023 due to fears that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates higher than expected and maintain them at peak levels for an extended period. However, the indexes have since recovered those losses and more, with the S&P 500 up more than 29% since its low at the end of October.Year-to-date, the S&P 500 has risen about 11.5%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has climbed 5.5%, and the Nasdaq Composite has increased about 12%. Despite these gains, the warning from JPMorgan suggests that investors should brace for potential turbulence ahead.","JP Morgan has issued a stark warning about the US stock market predicting a significant drop in the S&P 500 by the end of the year.
