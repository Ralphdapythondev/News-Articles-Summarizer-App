Gautam Adani takes a dig at Hindenburg report at Adani Group AGM; says short-seller attack was designed to defame group,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gautam-adani-takes-a-dig-at-hindenburg-report-at-adani-group-agm-says-short-seller-attack-was-designed-to-defame-group/articleshow/111226224.cms,"Adani Group AGM: Top 10 Takeaways

Gautam Adani claimed that amplified by a segment of biased media, Hindenburg's allegations were intended to tarnish the group’sreputation, inflict maximum harm, and undermine its market value. In a scenario where many companies would have faltered, Adani said that the group’s liquidity proved to be its strongest asset. To further strengthen financial reserves, Adani group secured an additional Rs 40,000 crore, ensuring it can comfortably manage debt repayments for the next two years. Envision the massive redevelopment project in Mumbai’s Dharavi as the group transforms the world’s largest slum over the next decade, providing improved living conditions for over one million residents. We achieved our highest EBITDA of Rs 82,917 crore (approximately $10 billion), reflecting an impressive 45% increase, he said. This outstanding performance propelled the PAT to a record Rs 40,129 crore, a significant 71% growth. Three of the group’s portfolio companies—Ambuja, ACC, and APSEZ—have now achieved AAA ratings. India is no longer at a crossroads; we are on the verge of entering our greatest growth phase, he said. With our demographic advantage, we are well on our way to becoming the largest middle class the world has ever seen, Adani added. The foundation for growth is firmly established, and the next decade promises even greater advancements. Our infrastructure spending is projected to grow at a CAGR of 20-25%, reaching a cumulative total of $2.5 trillion, he said. The foundation for growth is firmly established, and the next decade promises even greater advancements, he claimed.

Adani Group Chairman, Gautam Adani , has hit out about the controversy sparked by the US-based short-seller Hindenburg Research in January 2023, which plunged the company into significant turmoil due to allegations of corporate governance lapses. At the time as well, Adani had refuted all the accusations.According to an ET report, at Adani Enterprises' Annual General Meeting on Monday, Gautam Adani said, “Typical short sellers target gains from financial markets. This was different. It was a two-sided attack – a vague criticism of our financial standing and, at the same time, an information distortion campaign, dragging us into a political battlefield.”Adani claimed that the short-seller attack was designed to defame group, do maximum damage. He also said that the headwinds that tested the Adani Group made it stronger.With the National Democratic Alliance, led by Narendra Modi , securing power for a third consecutive term, the Adani Group is well-equipped to further the economic and social initiatives that have fueled its remarkable progress over the past ten years, Gautam Adani said at the AGM, according to the ET report.Adani asserted, ""India is no longer at the crossroads of destiny – we stand on the brink of our greatest growth phase. By the end of this decade, our nation is set to become the world's third-largest economy."" He further added, ""Given our demographic dividend, we are well on our way to being the largest middle class that the world will ever witness.""Adani also said, ""Despite never having faced any challenges with debt repayments, we chose to drop our Debt to EBITDA ratio to 2.5x in just six months. It now stands even lower at 2.2x. This approach has not only strengthened our financial resilience but has also increased our headroom for future expansion.""","Gautam Adani claimed that Hindenburg's allegations were intended to tarnish the group’sreputation, inflict maximum harm, and undermine its market value.

Prosus writes off its 9.6% stake in Byju’s; marks $493 million loss,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/prosus-writes-off-its-9-6-stake-byjus-marks-493-million-loss/articleshow/111225536.cms,"In its annual report, Prosus , a Dutch-listed technology investment firm, has written off its 9.6% stake in the struggling edtech company Byju's . The group attributed the write-off to a ""significant decrease in value for equity investors,"" recognizing a fair value loss of $493 million in other comprehensive income for the current year.According to an ET report, this move aligns with an earlier HSBC note, which assigned zero value to Prosus' nearly 10% stake in Byju's, citing multiple legal cases and funding challenges. HSBC had previously valued the stake by applying an 80% discount to the latest publicly disclosed valuation.Over the years, Prosus has invested $500 million in Byju's, making it one of its largest edtech bets in India. However, the investment has since turned sour. In addition to the Byju's write-off, Prosus has also marked its investment in Primrose Hill (ZestMoney) to zero, as compared to $38 million in the previous fiscal year.The write-off comes amidst ongoing legal troubles for Byju's. The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) has prohibited the edtech firm from proceeding with its second rights issue, directing it to maintain status quo in its shareholding. Byju's has filed a petition with the Karnataka High Court challenging the NCLT order, with the matter scheduled for hearing on Monday.Prosus is also engaged in a legal battle with Byju's in the Karnataka High Court, following the edtech firm's petition against a group of investors seeking the removal of CEO Raveendran from the company.

Standard deduction may rise under new tax regime,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/standard-deduction-may-rise-under-new-tax-regime/articleshow/111212512.cms,"NEW DELHI: The finance ministry is assessing the possibility of raising the standard deduction limit for income taxpayers under the new regime, without tinkering with the exemption-laced older regime.Besides, as the NDA govt readies to present its first Budget of its third term, it is unlikely to undertake major tweaks in capital gains mechanism, an issue on which the income tax department has been seeking a review. There have been suggestions to align the holding period across asset classes but govt may not be inclined to disturb the system, at least for the moment.While discussions on the contours of the Budget have just begun with finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman undertaking public consultations, most of the exercise is currently limited to the finance ministry and internal assessment is being undertaken on multiple issues some of which will be discussed with other wings of govt before the finance ministry takes a final call, based on feedback from the PMO.The overall mood indicates that most wings of govt are in favour of offering concessions to taxpayers, especially the middle class, which has been a supporter of the Modi regime but is increasingly raising questions about the returns it gets for the tax it pays, be it through public healthcare or education.In the 2023 Budget, FM had introduced a standard deduction of Rs 50,000 for salaried taxpayers and those who earn pension under the new tax regime, which became the default option, unless you opted out. Also, rebate under Section 87A was increased under the new tax regime for taxable incomes not exceeding Rs 7 lakh, allowing those earning up to this level (taxable income) to not pay any tax under the new regime. The highest surcharge under the new regime was also removed.Currently, individuals with a taxable income of upwards of Rs 3 lakh have to pay 5% income tax and there have been suggestions from industry leaders to tweak the rates in the higher brackets to boost consumption. A higher standard deduction will benefit all the salaried taxpayers, including those in the upper segment although it will entail some revenue loss.","The finance ministry is assessing the possibility of raising the standard deduction limit for income taxpayers under the new regime.

New GST era set to start with end of anti-profiteering clause,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-gst-era-set-to-start-with-end-of-anti-profiteering-clause/articleshow/111195828.cms,"NEW DELHI: While deciding to do away with the anti-profiteering clause , which mandates sellers to pass on benefit of tax cuts , GST Council Saturday signalled its intent to transition to the next stage with rationalisation , including a possible reduction in slabs, as well as roadmap for compensation cess on products such as cars, coal, cola and tobacco will be taken up at its next meeting scheduled for end of August.The panel of finance ministers headed by Union FM Nirmala Sitharaman decided to end the ant-profiteering provision from April, which means that from next fiscal year, sellers or service providers cannot be hauled up in case they do not pass on benefit of tax cuts to consumers. Existing cases will be handled by principal bench of GST Appellate Tribunal, an official statement said.Sitharaman also said that some of the group of ministers have been recast as 11 new finance ministers have joined the Council with the one on rationalisation, now headed by Bihar deputy CM Samrat Chaudhary, been asked to make a presentation at the next meeting of the all-powerful body, which is likely to be held after a couple of months. “When GST Council meets next, GoM will make a presentation and discussion on rationalisation will start,” FM said while stating that a decision may not be taken during the meeting itself. It is unlikely that the ministers are going to rush ahead with a decision given that crucial assembly polls are due at the end of the year.At Saturday’s meeting, Karnataka sought a discussion on compensation cess that is levied on several products to cover the “revenue loss” states. While the cess was for five years, it had to be extended up to March 2026 following the outbreak of Covid-19 as state had to borrow from the market to meet the shortfall in collections. With borrowings likely to be repaid only in 2025-26, the GST Council will deliberate on the future of the levy and the sharing formula in case some amount is left in the kitty after repaying the loans.Asked about including petrol and diesel within the ambit of GST, FM said that the law has a provision for their inclusion but it was for the states to first decide on it and then fix the rate of tax. Responding to another query, revenue secretary Sanjay Malhotra said the issue of GST exemption for fertiliser too has been referred to the group of ministers.",The panel of finance ministers headed by Union FM Nirmala Sitharaman decided to end the ant-profiteering provision from April.

Explainer: Why food prices will remain high in India. Why has the monsoon not helped?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/explainer-why-food-prices-will-remain-high-in-india-why-has-the-monsoon-not-helped/articleshow/111169276.cms,"Here are FAQs in food prices in India:

What is driving food inflation higher?

Why has the monsoon not helped?

When will prices come down?

Can government intervention help?

Why are food prices still a concern despite easing retail inflation?

(With inputs from agencies)

Food inflation in India, driven primarily by supply-side factors such as adverse weather conditions affecting crops, has remained persistently high at around 8% year-on-year since November 2023. Despite the early arrival of monsoon rains and forecasts predicting above-normal rainfall, there is little optimism that food prices will ease soon. The elevated food prices, which account for nearly half of the overall consumer price basket, have kept headline inflation above the central bank's target of 4%, thereby preventing any cuts in interest rates.Adverse weather conditions: The drought last year and an ongoing heat wave have significantly reduced the supplies of key food items such as pulses, vegetables, and cereals.Supply chain disruptions: High temperatures in nearly half of the country, soaring 4-9 degrees Celsius above normal, have spoiled harvested and stored vegetables and hindered the planting of crops like onions, tomatoes, eggplant, and spinach.Seasonal planting challenges: Farmers usually prepare vegetable seedlings before the June-September monsoon rains, but this year, excessive heat and water scarcity have disrupted both seedling planting and replanting, exacerbating the shortage.Although the annual monsoon arrived early and advanced swiftly to cover the western state of Maharashtra ahead of schedule, this initial momentum soon waned, resulting in an 18% rainfall deficit so far this season. The weakened monsoon has delayed the planting of summer-sown crops, which rely on sufficient rainfall. Despite June's patchy rains, India's weather office has forecast above-average rainfall for the rest of the monsoon season, providing some hope for agricultural output.Vegetable prices are expected to fall from August onwards if the monsoon revives and covers the entire country as per the usual schedule. However, potential floods or a prolonged dry spell in July and August could disrupt the production cycle. Prices of milk, cereals, and pulses are unlikely to decrease soon due to tight supplies. Wheat supplies are dwindling, with no plans from the government to import grain, which will likely allow wheat prices to rise further. Rice prices may also increase as the government has raised the minimum support price of paddy rice by 5.4%.Government interventions, such as restricting exports and easing imports, can help bring down the prices of some food commodities. However, ""the government can do little when it comes to prices of vegetables, which are highly perishable and difficult to import."" While measures like restricting exports of sugar, rice, onions, and wheat have been implemented, these have proved unpopular among farmers and have led to electoral losses for the ruling party in rural areas. With state elections approaching in key agricultural states, the central government may allow some crop prices to rise instead of taking aggressive measures.Retail inflation, measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), has been gradually easing, reaching a 12-month low of 4.8% in May 2024. However, ""this positive trend faces potential reversals due to persistent food price pressures,"" especially in vegetables and pulses, with overall food inflation remaining steady at 7.9%. The central bank has consistently cautioned about volatile food prices, which are particularly affected by weather-related shocks like the recent heat wave. These fluctuations have kept food inflation elevated, complicating the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) goal of maintaining inflation at its 4% target.Economic outlook and monetary policy implicationsDue to stubborn food price pressures, the RBI has maintained its policy rate at 6.5%, emphasizing a focus on withdrawing accommodation to align inflation with its target while supporting growth. Prospects of interest rate cuts are on hold as the RBI evaluates inflationary pressures amid volatile weather conditions. Despite these challenges, India's real GDP growth in the first quarter of 2024-25 is largely maintaining momentum, with global economic growth prompting many central banks worldwide to adopt a less restrictive monetary policy stance.","Food inflation in India has remained persistently high at around 8% year-on-year since November 2023.

Groww investor alleges fund deduction without investment: Heres what the company said

Groww faced criticism over false folio number claims. The company clarified no money was deducted from accounts. Customer support team is accessible 24/7 to address queries.

MUMBAI: For Prosus , one of Byju’s largest investors, the startup now has zero value. The company has written off the fair value of its 9.6% stake in Byju’s, the Netherlands-based technology investor said in its FY24 annual report on Monday, marking a steep downturn for a startup which was once valued at $22 billion.“We impaired Byju’s down to zero at the end of FY24. We have written down Byju’s primarily because we have inadequate information on the company’s financial health, liabilities and future outlook,” a company spokesperson said. Prosus, which has infused over $500 million into the troubled startup, said that it has recognised a fair value loss of $493 million on its investment in Byju’s in FY24.A series of financial and corporate governance lapses cost Byju’s the trust of its investors who had collectively invested over $5 billion into the company that sought to leverage technology and reduce barriers to quality education for students. Byju’s widening rift with its investors has been out in the open and has reached the courtroom with a group of investors including Prosus filing an oppression and mismanagement suit against the startup’s management.Investors Prosus, General Atlantic, Sofina and Peak XV Partners have also been opposed to Byju’s rights issue and have managed to get a court-approved order restricting the startup from using funds raised through the rights issue. In June last year, Prosus representative Russell Dreisenstock stepped down from Byju’s board citing disregard for Dreisenstock’s advice and recommendations by Byju’s leadership. In Feb, a majority of Byju’s investors led by Prosus also voted to oust Byju Raveendran as the CEO while seeking a reconstitution of the company’s family run board.While Byju’s bleeds, Prosus’ other portfolio company Swiggy’s revenues grew 24% while its gross order value grew by 26% y-o-y on the back of healthy order growth and higher average order value in CY2023. “Adjusted Ebitda improved to a loss of $261 million,” Prosus said.","Prosus writes off its 9.6% stake in struggling edtech firm Byju's, citing a significant decrease in value.

The sources told Reuters that a reduction in personal tax could boost consumption and increase savings for the middle class. The first source mentioned that individuals earning over Rs 15 lakh ($17,960.42) annually, up to a certain undetermined amount, may receive some tax relief.

The changes could be made to the new income tax regime introduced in 2020, where annual income up to Rs 15 lakh is taxed at rates between 5% and 20%, while earnings over Rs 15 lakh are taxed at 30%.

The second source pointed out that the personal tax rate increases six-fold when an individual's income rises from Rs 300,000 to Rs 15 lakh, which they described as ""quite steep.""

The government may also consider lowering personal tax rates for annual incomes of Rs 10 lakh, according to the first source. They added that a new threshold is being discussed for income taxed at the highest rate of 30% under the old tax system.

The second source noted that any loss of tax income to the government through tax cuts could be partially offset by increased consumption from this category of income earners.

The finance minister set the stage for a ""Viksit Bharat by 2047"", on the core principles of ‘Sabka Saath’, ‘Sabka Vikas’, ‘Sabka Vishwas’, with ‘Sabka Prayas’ being added as a new theme in the interim Budget.This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data i.e., farmer welfare and N for Nari utthan i.e., support for women entrepreneurs. These form the pillars of a comprehensive inclusive development. The Government's commitment to sustainable development under the strategy for Amrit Kaal includes achieving 'Net Zero' by 2070, rooftop solarization for one crore households and robust health initiatives.The Indian economy's resilience takes center stage amidst positive indicators of declining current account deficit as a percentage of GDP, falling unemployment rates, and a notable rise in digital transactions. These statistics affirm the robustness of the economy, showcasing a trajectory of growth and stability.The achievements in taxation reforms are nothing short of remarkable, with direct tax collections more than trebling in the last decade, the number of tax return filers increasing by 2.4 times, average processing time of tax returns plummeting from 93 days in FY 2013-14 to an impressive 10 days in FY 2023-24, resulting in issuance of quick refunds. These are the results of consistent progressive measures thus obviating the need for, and rightly avoiding, any last-minute populist measures.No change in existing tax rates, both for direct and indirect taxes, is a good indicator of stability and predictability for investors and taxpayers.A welcome move to waive outstanding tax demands that are minor, disputed, and unreconciled. This involves the withdrawal of outstanding direct tax demands up to Rs. 25,000 pertaining to the period up to FY 2009-10 and up to Rs.10,000 for FY 2010-11 to 2014-15.The Government's commitment to fostering a business-friendly environment is evident in its intent to extend specific tax benefits for start-ups, investments by sovereign wealth funds/ pension funds, and certain IFSC units. The extension has been made now until March 31, 2025. This might help in creating a conducive landscape for business.To align with the CBDT notification issued earlier, the provisions relating to tax collection at source concerning remittances under the Liberalized Remittance Scheme have now been formally incorporated in the Finance Bill, 2024, setting the rate at 20% for amounts exceeding Rs. 7 lakhs in a financial year.The Finance Bill, 2024 proposes an extension of the time limit for introducing the faceless scheme by the Central Government for transfer pricing proceedings, DRP Proceedings, and ITAT Proceedings, up to March 31, 2025.The interim Budget 2024 may not have proposed significant tax announcements, but it very well positioned the prelude to the full budget post the upcoming elections. Considering the potential impact on the population across the four pillars of GYAN, a sizable portion of India stands to be covered. The interim Budget’s focus on the tax front resembles a report card, highlighting the maturity achieved by our tax system. The enhancement of taxpayer services was emphasized as a key priority.","This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data and N for Nari utthan.

The Finance Minister on February 01, 2024, delivered a truly innovative interim budget. At first glance, it did not seem like an interim budget but looked more like the budget to drive further growth and a continuum of inclusive growth-oriented investments.At the outset, this budget brings a wonderful balance between fiscal prudence and continued investment for growth. It's not easy to continue the glide path of reducing the fiscal deficit and continuing to make significant investments in all areas including infrastructure, R&D, energy transition, technology, skilling, and social welfare. The surprising reduction in fiscal deficit of 5.8% as against the budgeted 5.9% for FY24 and the projection of 5.1% in FY25 with a clear focus on increasing investments was a huge positive.This was a budget for everyone and all because it caters to every part of the Indian economy and society. The FM has carefully catered to the investment needs of various sectors. The continued focus on youth, impoverished, women and farmers to increase their involvement and contribution to economic growth is evident. By committing an 11.1% increase in capital expenditure to 11,11,111 lakh crore, the FM has clearly brought every single 1 in this growth journey.What was very impressive was the inclusion strategy of the government. The focus on women's empowerment for the past few years is unprecedented, which is reflected in the inclusion of women in the workforce moving from 23.3% to 37% in the last five years. The thirty crore Mudra Yojna loans to women entrepreneurs were a great boost to the Nari Shakti initiative. We already have over 10 million Lakhpati Didis and what is truly evident is like a corporate CFO, the FM has revised the earlier target of 20 million Lakhpati Didis to 30 million. The government also plans to invest in initiatives to encourage young girls between the ages of 9 and 14 to undertake the vaccination for cervical cancer which is again a great boost to Nari Shakti.A lot needs to be done to bring more women into all parts of economic growth but the journey so far and the vision of the future is truly inspiring.While India continues on its technological prowess and makes its mark in new technologies like Artificial Intelligence, we need a multi-pronged strategy to harness the power of AI. We need a clear focus on building AI systems in India so that we not only emerge as a global leader in this new era but can build models, which are specific to India that will benefit Indians. At the same time, we need a very wide coverage program to build skills to leverage AI to its fullest potential. The biggest contribution we can make to the inclusion of youth in the economic development of the country is by skilling them in new skill areas. In the last few years, the Skill India Mission has trained 14 million youth, reskilled over 5 million youth and established a staggering 3,000 new ITIs. The future of any country will depend as much on capital investments as on skill investments.The focus on agricultural development and support to the farmer continues through direct financial assistance to farmers. The farmers have benefited by getting crop insurance through PM Fasal Bima Yojana. It's not just the farmers, the PM-SVANidhi provides credit assistance to a large number of street vendors.The last few years have seen the journey of affordable housing through Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY). There is a slight increase in allocation to launch a scheme for encouraging the middle class to build or buy new homes. This investment will likely propel a wider economic development and increase employment.India has seen a tremendous rise in entrepreneurship in the last few years. In order to continue the journey and promote new startups, the government proposes to extend certain tax benefits, which are expiring from March 2024 to March 2025. The MSMEs have not been left behind. With a proposal to provide timely finances to such enterprises, the government has paved the way for their growth, so they can look to compete globally.All in all, it’s a truly inclusive budget with a clear focus on development not just by giving away freebies but enabling the people to participate in the economic development activity. While the FM calls the comprehensive GDP - Governance, Development & Performance – to me, this budget is inclusive of another GDP – gender, demography, and professions.","Akhilesh Tuteja is Partner and Head, Clients and Markets, KPMG in India.

creates room for lower interest rates?

One of the issues that the Budget has flagged is the demographic challenge and opportunity and the societal change that is taking place. How do you view this?

Niti Aayog is working on the Viksit Bharat roadmap. What will be the focus areas?

You are as much a representative of the Centre as well as the states. Is it time to revisit the entire formula for transfers to states particularly on the issue of cesses and surcharges?

Suman Bery , who heads Niti Aayog , the govt think tank, is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China, which he says is also an opportunity for India. The economist is confident that Indian states remain resilient. Excerpts of the interview with TOI.The finance ministry expects the economy to grow 7% next year. Given the global situation, how do you see the prospects?The belief in the finance ministry is that we have a possible drag coming from the external sector but that we have other sources. We have enough domestic sources of demand. One has to applaud the political and economic judgment of FM in deciding that it was appropriate to pursue the path of fiscal consolidation. There is transparency. What this actually reflects is responsible economic management, which is one reason we are where we are. Second, it also creates a buffer so that there is policy space if we do encounter headwinds.That’s the hope and expectation. We have an independent central bank and an inflation targeting central bank, so it is up to the monetary policy committee to take a call through the monetary policy committee on the repo rate .The PM has said that when India grows its states grow. India is a composite of 37 states and UTs. They are each at very different points in their demographic transition. There are some states where the net replacement rate is down to 1%, like Kerala . There are others, particularly UP and Bihar, which are in their earliest stage of demographic transition and each one of these states is the size of a large European country. There are two implications of that — one is internal labour mobility and it will become an even larger part of our growth model. The govt has taken several steps to create a unified market. Our main endowment is our human capital and that has to be equipped to participate in global exchange in many ways. We know from China, Japan that the demographic dividend partly depends on markets and on human capital. But the golden period is fairly short lived, about 15 years, when the so called dependency ratio declines. The other big opportunity the PM has been highlighting is bringing women much more into the active labour force.When Niti was set up there was the idea of a three-year vision and a seven-year strategy paper. The reality is that schemes of govt tend to be aligned with the award of the Finance Commission . There are various established building blocks or hand holds which are already a matter of govt policy. The PM is much more interested in a national debate on what it means to be a Viksit Bharat or modern society. We have a collective goal and it is for the democratic polity to define what that goal should be. Its emphatically not for a super mandarin bureaucracy. It is not going to be Lee Kwan Yew’s Singapore led from the top.It’s entirely a finance ministry matter but I would be lying if I didn’t say when I visit certain states there is this complaint. A big frontier would be resource mobilisation at the state level. Second is going to be rationalisation of subsidies not only at the Union level, but also at the state level. All chief ministers sit on my governing council. When they convene as the governing council, I see them in their role as development practitioners. The world is beginning to appreciate quite how much institutional and political maturity India attained in our 75 years and the most fundamental dimension of a democracy, we have orderly transfers of power. There are enough buffers to ensure that what happens in state finances is unlikely to create macro instability. Those risks are well contained by our Constitution.

Government's Marathon to 2047: Emphasis on Fiscal Prudence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/governments-marathon-to-2047-emphasis-on-fiscal-prudence/articleshow/107371788.cms,"What was the thinking behind keeping the vote on account absolutely straight?

So is it the idea to keep the Budget completely transparent?

The capex has risen 11.1% and there is an emphasis on infrastructure spending. But there is also the hope that the private sector will now take over and start capital spending. Given the geopolitical situation, how confident is the govt that it will pan out as planned?

Finance secretary T V Somanathan, in an interview with TOI, says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047 . Excerpts:If you see the Budget speech you will see the emphasis on 2047. The govt has set its sight on running that marathon. Running to 2047 is a marathon , it’s not a sprint. If you are going to run a marathon, you need to be in good shape and you can’t have short-term stimulants or something that will get you some yards and then it’s done.The whole focus is on making India a developed country by 2047, for which a healthy present and a strong fiscal position is an important concomitant. Some purely short term measures don’t really fit into that picture. It’s a consistent picture: focus on the long term for which you need to build strength in the short term and that needs to be done by prudence in fiscal policy and by not doing things which can detract you from that path. Not doing the wrong thing is more important than appearing to do things.The idea is that govt finances may be good, bad or indifferent depending on the times, depending on the circumstances, depending on the policies. But what is the position should be reflected as reasonably and accurately as possible. That is an emphasis. As regards the Finance Commission, again the terms of reference that have been given to them are the terms in the Constitution.What is the means by which the devolution should be done is a matter they have full discretion. They can actually take all kinds of factors into account and in a sense we felt this time based on my review of the previous commissions that the right expression would be less is more. The shorter, less prescriptive terms of reference gives full scope for all stakeholders including state govts to express their viewpoints and for the commission to take a balanced view of the different perspectives and then come to its award. Ultimately the award of the Finance Commission is about devolution and grant for which full scope has now been given to them.n There are incipient signs of private capital expenditure accelerating. There are some surveys I have seen done by some of the chambers industry, which show high levels of investment. The PMI, which is a sort of leading indicator, is also looking pretty healthy. Capacity utilisation is one reason that private sector capital expenditure doesn’t immediately pick up when the economy starts accelerating because there is surplus capacity.But increasingly I get the sense that many industries are beginning to reach levels where they have to add capacity. When that happens capital investment will happen. Another pointer also mentioned in the Budget speech you may notice that our airlines have placed large orders for planes — that is capital expenditure.When you import 1,000 aircraft, it’s just not 1,000 aircraft, there are concomitant additions to ground handling facilities, you need airports to expand, you need to employ people to do that. That means a lot of jobs. The aircraft is capital but then look at the effect it is going to have on skilled jobs. So capital expenditure is happening. I am fairly confident that we will have decent capital expenditure in the year to come and that will become a new source of acceleration.",Finance secretary T V Somanathan says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047. The capex has risen 11.1% and there is an emphasis on infrastructure spending.

What is the Section 80C limit for tax deduction for FY 2024-25 after Interim Budget 2024?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/income-tax-budget-2024-2024-2025-section-80c-limit-epf-ppf-elss-nsc/articleshow/107353021.cms,"ALSO READ |

Income Tax Changes Budget 2024 : In the recent Budget 2024 speech, the Finance Minister kept the Section 80C tax deduction limit unchanged. The maximum limit for claiming tax benefits under Section 80C remains at Rs 1.5 lakh for the current fiscal year 2023-24 and will stay the same for individuals looking to save on taxes through Section 80C investments in the upcoming fiscal year 2024-25.Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions. Individuals can reduce their gross taxable income by up to Rs 1.5 lakh per financial year by engaging in these specific investments or expenditures.You can save on taxes through Section 80C by investing in things like Employees' Provident Fund (EPF), Public Provident Fund (PPF), Equity Linked Saving Scheme (ELSS) mutual funds, National Savings Certificate (NSC), and 5-year tax-saving fixed deposits with banks or post offices. Additionally, paying life insurance policy premiums also qualifies for tax benefits under Section 80C.It is important to note that each eligible investment comes with its specific maximum limit, rate of return, liquidity, and taxation rules for the earned returns, states ET in a report. For instance, the most you can invest in PPF in a financial year is Rs 1.5 lakh. Meanwhile, there's no limit on the amount you can invest in ELSS mutual funds, but the Section 80C deduction is capped at Rs 1.5 lakh.If individuals can't make specific investments, they can still get deductions under Section 80C from their gross taxable income through certain expenses. These expenses include repaying the principal amount of a home loan, tuition fees for children, payment of stamp duty, registration fees, and other costs related to buying a house.Since the financial year 2020-21, individuals without any business income must annually choose between the old and new tax regimes. As of the fiscal year 2023-24, the new tax regime is the default option. Consequently, individuals seeking tax deductions under Section 80C must opt for the old tax regime since this deduction isn't available in the new tax regime. It's crucial for taxpayers to be aware of these rules to make informed decisions about their tax planning and investment strategies.","Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions.

He helps auto majors engineer their products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/he-helps-auto-majors-engineer-their-products/articleshow/111211713.cms,"He made his first rupee selling lemonade as a Class VIII student at a school charity event in Tuticorin. “That’s when I learned that you can make money and, at the same time, make people happy,” says auto industry veteran Radha Krishnan. “It was a very hot day,” he recalls with a smile.Radha Krishnan is founder and president of Detroit Engineered Products (DEP), which provides engineering services for end-to-end product development and a digital designing software catering to automobile and other industries. After completing mechanical engineering at Indian Institute of Technology Madras, and a brief stint at Tata Consulting Engineers, he moved to the US to pursue a Master’s. He worked as engineering consultant for some time and later joined US auto major General Motors.In 1998, Radha Krishnan started Detroit Engineered Products, offering services for product development from design benchmarking to evaluation to prototype development. DEP has a proprietary software, MeshWorks, for computer-aided engineering (CAE). Experience at GM and a small engineering services firm in the US helped him gain entrepreneurial skills and identify gaps in the existing design stimulation.The company now offers services to major automakers around the world. It has around 70% of its 500-plus workforce in India, predominantly in Chennai where it has an engineering and research and development centre. “We have a very strong engineering team that can develop complete electro-mechanical systems, all the way from systems engineering to detailed component development, and deliver the fully assembled prototypes,” says Radha Krishnan. With a push for manufacturing in India, there is a potential uptick in the business here, he adds.DEP also creates and deploys machine learning models for design development, which includes geometric modelling and predictive analytics. Its CAE software can create digital models from geometric shape, says Radha Krishnan. It’s like how AI models create pictures and text. But, he says, generation of these three-dimensional models is a complex task compared to image generation. The software can also link geometric changes to predictive responses, such as how a change will impact the vehicle in a crash, he says.The industry has come a long way from 3D modelling of an engine taking a couple of months; now it gets done in three-four days. “Sophistication of the models has improved dramatically,” he says.“I’ve been part of the auto industry for 35 years. But I have not seen dramatic changes like those in the last six years in the first 30 years. Companies have to navigate not just technological shift to electric propulsion but also shift in user preferences,” says Radha Krishnan. This, he says, has pushed the demand for highly accurate tools and better modelling for faster commercialisation.In the late 1990s, he was part of the propulsion stimulation team at GM’s EV-1 programme, the first electric vehicle platform to be mass produced and considered the first modern electric car. Now as many traditional car makers struggle to get roll out EVs, Radha Krishnan says DEP has built a range of solutions for electric vehicle development from optimising motors to power electronics.","Radha Krishnan is founder and president of Detroit Engineered Products.

The ministry will seek one-time relief for de-notification of land parcels due to the increased value near highway networks, expecting landowners to take them back.

MUMBAI: The country’s current account balance showed a surplus for the first time in 10 quarters in Q4FY24 . The surplus was a result of higher inflows from service exports and individuals .In Q4, the surplus was $5.7 billion compared to a deficit of $8.7 billion in the previous quarter. The current account position was a 0.6% surplus as a percentage of GDP, compared to a 1% deficit in Q3FY24.For the full year, the current account deficit narrowed down to $23 billion or 0.7% of the GDP from $67 billion or 2% of GDP in FY23.

On a quarterly basis, the last surplus was in Q3FY21 when imports had decreased during the pandemic. Service exports in Q4FY24 increased by 4.1% year-over-year, driven by more exports of software, travel, and business services. Net service receipts were $42.7 billion, up from $39.1 billion a year ago, contributing to the current account surplus in Q4 2023-24.Receipts from private transfers, primarily remittances sent by Indians working abroad, totaled $32.0 billion, marking an 11.9% increase compared to the previous year.In Q4 2023-24, net inflows from external commercial borrowings to India were $2.6 billion, up from $1.7 billion a year ago.

Jain raises $5 billion in biggest hedge fund debut since 2018,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/jain-raises-5-billion-in-biggest-hedge-fund-debut-since-2018/articleshow/111242220.cms,"File photo

Former co-chief investment officer at Millennium Management, Bobby Jain , has gathered $5.3 billion in commitments for his new multi-strategy hedge fund , marking the biggest fundraising haul since ExodusPoint Capital Management 's record debut.

Jain Global will start trading July 1, according to people familiar with the matter. Investors include endowments, foundations, family offices, bank wealth platforms and sovereign wealth funds.

The premiere caps a busy year for Jain who has travelled the world pitching his fund. He initially aimed to gather as much as $10 billion. But after struggling to hit that goal, he cut client fees to entice investors and reduced his target to between $5 billion and $6 billion. A representative for the firm declined to comment.

Even with the revised goal, Jain Global is the biggest launch since 2018. Jain topped fellow Millennium alumnus Diego Megia, whose Taula Capital Management began trading this month with $5 billion. Megia spun out his macro pod from Millennium and received $3 billion from his former employer. Jain has been raising money in a challenging environment, as interest rates remain elevated and deals have slowed to a trickle. New hedge funds also face stiff competition from bigger multistrategy funds with established track records.

BENGALURU: Adani Group is “well positioned” to capitalize on opportunities in the country’s booming infrastructure sector as spending is expected to surge, chairman Gautam Adani told investors on Monday.The group, which has businesses across ports, power utilities, transmission and coal trading, is betting on India’s infrastructure spending that is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 20-25%, Adani said. The group has become much “stronger” since it came under attack by US-based short-seller Hindenburg Research last year, Adani said at the annual general meeting of the group’s flagship company, Adani Enterprises.Last January, Hindenburg accused the Adani Group of improper use of tax havens and stock manipulation. The group, which refuted the allegations, sparked a $150 billion meltdown in market value as the short-seller’s report roiled investor confidence and attracted regulatory scrutiny.Group companies, including Adani Power and Adani Ports, recouped all their losses and moved past pre-Hindenburg levels last year. Adani Enterprises, too, bounced back past those levels in May. “The headwinds that tested us became the very ones that made us even stronger,” Adani said, pointing to investments from GQG Partners, TotalEnergies and Abu Dhabi conglomerate International Holding after the Hindenburg saga.The Supreme Court said in January 2024 that no further scrutiny was needed on the company. This was after a court-appointed panel said that India’s markets watchdog “drew a blank” in investigations into suspected violations in overseas investments in the Adani Group. reuters","Adani Group is betting on India’s infrastructure spending that is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 20-25%, Gautam Adani said.

According to a research report from a prominent stock exchange bank, the total market capitalisation of the major US-based Bitcoin mining companies recently reached a new all-time high, suggesting growing investor interest and capital inflows in the Bitcoin mining sector.Meanwhile, investors continue to express bullish sentiments about an emerging meme cryptocurrency called Raboo ($RABT) as it keeps edging closer towards a notable presale milestone, which is raising $2 million from the sale of its native tokens. Here’s more about investors' interest in the mining companies as well as the force driving the new presale crypto toward incredible heights.Following the Bitcoin halving event in April 2024, the market capitalisation of major US Bitcoin mining companies has been increasing. The increase persisted till June 15th, when the total market capitalisation of the mining companies reached a new all-time high of $22.8 billionInterestingly, analysts claim the growth of Bitcoin mining companies outperformed BTC’s price growth, hinting at investors’ belief that investing in the mining sector could be more profitable than holding BTC.Although Bitcoin's price is currently at $64,700, it has been down 2.7% over the past week. Amid the notable achievements of its mining companies, experts remain optimistic about the cryptocurrency, believing that its downtrend may not persist long-term.Investors are continually captivated by this promising meme coin project called Raboo, which keeps displaying remarkable growth by raising over $1.8 million from the sale of its presale tokens. As a project that allows its investors to earn passive income by simply posting quality memes on social media, Raboo has positioned itself not only for more milestones but also to become one of the most desirable presale tokens in the meme coin space.One of the factors that has attracted investors to Raboo is its strategic token burn mechanism, which aims to maintain token scarcity by constantly removing tokens from circulation so that the value of $RABT can easily increase. Remarkably, Raboo also plans to implement a zero buy-and-sell tax structure, an innovative approach that ensures smooth and frictionless transactions, allowing investors to maximise their returns without the burden of excessive fees.Raboo currently sells its presale tokens at just $0.0048 in Stage 4 of the presale; numerous investors are buying into this new meme coin sensation. This is because the token also boasts of a potential surge in demand and value that could potentially reach 100-fold after it enters the market.The total market capitalization of the US based Bitcoin mining companies reaching a new all-time high, implies that more people now prefer mining Bitcoin than just holding its tokens.Meanwhile, Raboo is expected to attract more investors to take part in its presale especially when it reaches the $2 million milestone. The platform's strategic token burn mechanism and plans for a zero buy-and-sell tax structure is also expected to heightened its appeal, making it a presale crypto with further upside potential.Telegram channel: Telegram: https://t.me/RabootokenPortal Twitter handle: Twitter: https://twitter.com/Raboo_Official",Raboo ($RABT) is raising $2 million from the sale of its native tokens.

The XRP price forecast hints at stability around the $0.5 mark despite recent fluctuations that reflect underlying market resilience. Meanwhile, Injective (INJ) drops signal challenges ahead, with an increase in network activity that may not offset the downward trend.Amid these contrasting scenarios, BlockDAG announces a $2 million giveaway, intensifying its claim as one of the top bullish crypto . With over $53.2 million raised in its presale and strategic global campaigns, BlockDAG is poised to redefine the blockchain landscape.XRP is currently testing the $0.5 mark, having recently approached this key price level only to pull back swiftly. Despite this fluctuation, the overall market sentiment around XRP might appear weak; however, underlying strengths suggest resilience. The MACD indicator, a gauge of market momentum, shows a bullish crossover.Further insights into the XRP price forecast indicate sustained interest at this critical half-dollar juncture. Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) positions XRP within a neutral range, hinting at balanced market conditions. This stability could be a precursor to future movements, keeping the XRP price forecast cautiously optimistic yet grounded in recent market behaviour.Despite a notable increase in network activity, Injective (INJ) drops have caught the attention of market watchers. Last week, a 41% rise in daily active addresses on the injective network was observed. Similarly, the surge in new addresses, up by 57%, suggests a rising interest in trading INJ despite its declining market value.Further analysis reveals that the uptick in the network activity, particularly the 1500% increase in large transaction volumes last month, may be a double-edged sword. Current technical indicators, like the Directional Movement Index and the Aroon Down Line, support a strong bearish outlook, hinting that the Injective (INJ) drops may continue before stabilising.BlockDAG's innovative $2 million giveaway marks a significant step in its mission to engage and expand its community. Participants eager to get involved need to hold at least $100 worth of BDAG coins purchased during the presale. Community members can increase their odds of winning by accomplishing various tasks and referring friends. This initiative not only incentivises participation but also underscores BlockDAG's robustness in a market where both new and established cryptocurrencies often falter.Simultaneously, BlockDAG is enhancing its global footprint. The company's strategic visibility campaigns are making waves worldwide, from the bustling Shibuya Crossing in Tokyo to the luminous billboards of Las Vegas and London's iconic Piccadilly Circus. Recently, BlockDAG also launched a moon-themed keynote, symbolising its ambitious goal to push the boundaries of blockchain technology. These strategic placements underscore its dedication to becoming one of the top bullish crypto, revolutionising blockchain with unprecedented scalability and security measures.The result of these dynamic marketing efforts is clear, as the presale numbers speak volumes. BlockDAG has successfully raised over $53.2 million through 18 presale batches, reflecting growing investor confidence and interest. The strategic placements and aggressive marketing have boosted visibility and significantly propelled presale momentum.Experts are now eyeing BlockDAG as a potential market leader with predictions of a 30,000x return on investment.

"Some Vietnam coffee farms thrive despite drought, but may not stop espresso price hikes",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/some-vietnam-coffee-farms-thrive-despite-drought-but-may-not-stop-espresso-price-hikes/articleshow/111217393.cms,"Bitter price effect?

PLEIKU: Vietnamese coffee growers have been hit hard this year by the worst drought in nearly a decade, raising concerns of pricier espressos across the world, even as some farmers keep yields healthy with clever countermeasures.Domestic forecasts for next season's harvest in Vietnam, the world's second biggest coffee producer, remain grim.The Mercantile Exchange of Vietnam (MVX) expects a 10-16% fall in output because of the extreme heat that hit the Central Highlands coffee region between March and early May, according to deputy head Nguyen Ngoc Quynh.However, a return of rains in recent weeks has improved the outlook, boosting confidence among farmers and officials. But it remains unclear whether the improved weather will help boost output and drive down prices of robusta beans, the variety most commonly found in espressos and instant coffees, of which Vietnam is the world's top producer.""I expect the country's output to fall by 10-15%, but my farm will increase production"", said Nguyen Huu Long, who grows coffee in a 50-hectare plantation in Gia Lai, one of the top coffee-producing provinces in Vietnam.To protect his trees during the heatwave, he kept the soil around the plants moist by covering it with leaves. Contrary to the local practice of cutting trees after a few years to boost soil quality, he keeps his growing for decades. As a result, plants have deeper roots and broader access to underground water reserves.Farmers in his plantation also soften the soil around plants to improve absorption of rainwater and fertilisers, said Doan Van Thang, 39.Tran Thi Huong, a tenant farmer who works in another plantation 20 km from Pleiku, Gia Lai's capital, resorted to using more water than usual. Thanks to abundant reserves from canals built by local authorities, she could keep her plants sufficiently irrigated during the heatwave.Coffee cherries are smaller than in previous years, but she expects the overall output to be unaffected. It also helped that she timely intervened with biopesticides against bugs that were more numerous than usual because of the extreme weather.That is in line with the forecast from the United States department of agriculture (USDA) which estimates Vietnam's next harvest would be roughly steady versus the current season's output far less pessimistic than domestic projections.Whatever the impact on the harvest will be, coffee prices for drinkers around the world are likely to rise.Wholesale prices in Vietnam and London-traded robusta futures have risen to record highs earlier this year mostly after an underwhelming harvest in Vietnam and because of fears over the country's next harvest after the drought, according to multiple traders and analysts.Record wholesale prices have so far had a limited impact on consumer prices, with coffee inflation up by only 1.6% in the 27-country European Union in April, according to the latest Eurostat data, and 2.5% in robusta-loving Italy.While well below price rises from a year earlier, it was higher than 1% in the March EU reading, a sign roasters may have started to pass their higher costs on consumers.Besides, worries about Vietnam are far from over, as insufficient rains after the drought or excessive downpours before the upcoming October harvest season could further reduce output, warned a Vietnam-based trader.The high wholesale prices may also be there to stay, as robusta demand is growing globally and farmers have boosted their leverage in the current circumstances, with many having also replaced coffee plants with pungent smelling durian, a tropical fruit experiencing huge demand in China.""They have the financial ability to hoard and hold on goods, so they will not be in a hurry to sell,"" said Le Thanh Son, of Simexco, one of Vietnam's biggest coffee exporters.","Domestic forecasts for next season's harvest in Vietnam remain grim.

Notably, an 18 per cent sales tax is projected to impact prices of pharmaceuticals, books, stationery, and poultry products.Despite a decline in petrol prices , the impact on essential commodities is expected to be offset by rising prices of perishable vegetables such as tomatoes, onions, and potatoes. Moreover, the imposition of increased sales tax and customs duties on fresh vegetables and fruits imported from Iran and Afghanistan is likely to further fuel food inflation in the near term.Weekly inflation had peaked at a record 48.35 per cent year-on-year in early May 2023, later moderating to as low as 24.4 per cent by late August 2023, before surging beyond 40 per cent in the week ending November 16, 2023, according to Dawn.The weekly price movements indicated significant increases for items such as tomatoes (65.84 per cent), potatoes (5.61 per cent), onions (3.78 per cent), bananas (3.29 per cent), LPG (2.44 per cent), cigarettes (1.67 per cent), pulse moong (1.53 per cent), garlic (1.29 per cent), fresh milk (0.95 per cent), eggs (0.83 per cent), georgette (0.28 per cent), and shirting (0.17 per cent).Conversely, items that witnessed price declines over the previous week included petrol (3.76 per cent), diesel (0.84 per cent), rice basmati broken and pulse masoor (0.08 per cent each), and chicken (0.05 per cent).On an annual basis, notable price increases were recorded for Q1 gas charges (570 per cent), tomatoes (191 per cent), onions (122.66 per cent), chillies powder (54.81 per cent), garlic (40.55 percent), shirting (30.75 per cent), salt powder (29.49 per cent), gents sandal (25.01 per cent), pulse gram (22.67 per cent), pulse mash (22.60 per cent), beef (22.12 per cent), and Q1 electricity charges (21.46 per cent).In contrast, prices decreased significantly for wheat flour (32.90 per cent), chicken (20.60 per cent), 5-liter cooking oil (16.17 per cent), 2.5 kg vegetable ghee (13.39 per cent), 1 kg vegetable ghee (12.42 per cent), bananas (11.69 per cent), mustard oil (8.24 per cent), Lipton tea (2.52 per cent), and petrol (1.38 per cent).The SPI index closed at 316.88 compared to 313.93 the previous week and 256 a year ago.

The rest of the market has been more subdued: the next best performing sector, utilities, is only up 9.5% year-to-date.Many investors believe the long-term case for tech stocks is solid, given their strong earnings and excitement over the revolutionary potential of artificial intelligence. But huge price gains, including Nvidia Corp 's 155% year-to-date run, have stirred worries that the tech rally might be overheated.Market laggards such as small caps and so-called value stocks such financials and industrials may be looking like bargains.""Nvidia has been a rocket ship, and when things go up this quickly you don't want to be the last one through the exit door,"" said Michael Purves, CEO of Tallbacken Capital Advisors. ""People want to be invested in this equity rally, and if they sell Nvidia the most likely places they are going to go is value and cyclical stocks .""A rotation out of big tech could allay concerns of concentration that have arisen in recent weeks, as themarket rally has once again narrowed to a handful of names. About 60% of the S&P 500's total return of more than 14% for the year has been driven by five companies whose shares have some of the heaviest weightings in the index: Nvidia, Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Alphabet, and Amazon.com , data from S&P Dow Jones Indices showed.Some signs of big tech exhaustion emerged in the past week. Nvidia shares are down 10% from their peak reached on Thursday, taking the chipmaker out of its short-lived position as the world's most valuable company. Nvidia is on track for a 4% decline for the week, while the S&P 500 is on track for a less than 1% gain.Closely watched economic data in the week ahead, including inflation data on Friday, could also affect investor positioning, as market participants gauge whether a nascent slowdown in inflation is continuing.Tech appears over-extended based on several barometers, Purves noted. The Relative Strength Indicator of the Mag6 Index, which measures the speed and magnitude of price changes in the stock market's six biggest stocks, is at the highest it has ever been, he said.Meanwhile, the price ratio between the Nasdaq 100 and the S&P 500 Equal Weight Index - a proxy for the average stock - has jumped 9% since the beginning of June, he said. The S&P 500, by contrast, is up nearly 4% this month.Optimism is high among retail and institutional investors, which some view as a contrarian indicator because it means the bar for positive surprises is elevated. The AAII Sentiment Survey was steady at 44% in the week ended June 19, about 8 percentage points above its historical average. Sentiment among fund managers in the latest survey by BofA Global Research was at its highest level since late 2021, with investors trimming cash positions and increasing equity allocations.The 13% month-to-date gain in the VanEck Semiconductor ETF is a sign that AI-fever might have gone too far, said Larry Tentarelli, chief technical strategist at Blue Chip Daily Trend Report.""In the near-term you could get a pullback in tech and semis, and a healthy rotation into other parts of the market that would keep this bull market going.""Even if a pullback does occur, there are few signs investors would leave tech and growth stocks for long. Betting against tech has been a losing proposition over the last decade, as the Nasdaq 100 index has advanced more than 400% while the Russell 1000 Value is up about 70% over the same time.The Russell Value index is up 5.6% this year. Investors have given an even chillier reception to small cap stocks , with the Russell 1000 down 0.5% year-to-date.Tech could rebound fairly quickly as investors rush to buy the dip. The Nasdaq 100 took five weeks to reach a new high after falling as much as 9% in April.""I don't get the sense that investors are looking to ring the register on this and book gains,"" said Jason Alonzo, portfolio manager at Harbor Capital Advisors. ""If anything, I'm seeing people who feel that they missed it trying to get in on this trend.""","The S&P 500 is up 14.6% this year. Most of the broader index's gains have been concentrated in the information technology and communications sectors. Many investors believe the long-term case for tech stocks is solid, given their strong earnings and excitement over the revolutionary potential of artificial intelligence.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111182536,imgsize-59368,width-400,resizemode-4/111182536.jpg"
