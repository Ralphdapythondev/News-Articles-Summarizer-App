Railway Budget 2024 : The government has wavered little in its efforts to spur a modernisation of railways in the country, pivoting on technology, to support the country’s economic ambitions. In line with expectations, Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore, marking yet another year of successive increase in outlay.That takes forward the past policies and the government’s vision, which have paved the way for modernisation of the transport behemoth.In earlier decades, the government had focused on laying tracks on new routes, electrification and incremental rolling stock capacity addition. That was the need of the hour back then and has helped set up the base for a larger transformation.For instance, the massive Dedicated Freight Corridor ( DFC ) as well as locomotive factories at Marhaura and Madhepura in Bihar were conceptualised over a decade ago and we are seeing their completion now.More recently, the focus has shifted to modernisation—of rolling stock and safety systems, among other aspects.This year, emphasis has also been laid on the railways’ crucial role in industrial development. Commodity-specific corridors have been planned in eastern India and impetus given to port connectivity. Vande Bharat and technology-led upgrades in rolling stock remain in focus. Safety has been prioritised through budgetary allocations for the anti-collision systemKavach . That said, there are other cogs in the wheel that demand attention from a long-term perspective.First, the target for the Operating Ratio, the crucial efficiency gauge, has been set at 98.22% for 2024-25, compared with 98.65% in 2023-24. This reflects an imminent need for operational transformation. An effective overhaul of the world’s fourth-largest rail network will take many years and thus we need to start focusing on improving efficiency and reducing costs now.DFC is almost entirely operational and will be complete over the next few months. To ensure the project achieves its twin goals of reducing logistics costs and enhancing freight efficiency, railways need to attract more cargo on the corridor. This will help increase the rail coefficient and make the railways’ approach more market-oriented, which will in turn aid future corridors.A revamp of railway stations is on track, with sufficient funds dedicated to this end. But even though new coaches and wagons are increasingly being added to meet footfalls, the stations and passenger trains themselves remain synonymous with chaos.Just as safety, comfort and convenience have been prioritised, there is a need for solutions to address the capacity and demand challenges. As a first step, the government could target development of new stations and setting up of new coach production units.As a leading freight mover, Indian Railways carried a record 1,588 MT cargo in fiscal 2024, up from 1,095 MT in fiscal 2015. It accounts for 26% of the cargo moved in the country—by no means an easy feat. The railways aims to take this volume to 3,000 MT by 2030, which would require a 11% CAGR against the around 4.2% witnessed over the last 10 years. As per a report by TERI and Shakti Foundation, from carrying about 62% of freight traffic in 1990-91, Indian Railways’ share has declined to ~27% in 2014-15. This has been due to the expanding road network, cost competitiveness over railways, and door-to-door service. Thus, commencing the cycle of increasing the rail share again is commendable.DFCs, a high-capacity track network, high-power locomotives and improvement in wagon designs have set the ball rolling for larger capacity, faster freight trains that deliver better efficiency.Yet, achieving exponential growth is a tall ask given the current dynamics. Possibly, similar challenges might apply to other goals the railways might have for 2047.To be fair, despite its scale and complexity, Indian Railways has been able to achieve diverse developments at commendable speed.But the track ahead is long and it is time to start discussing the reinvention of the institutional set-up.Indian Railways sees substantial private sector involvement in the form of vendors and contractors. Policymakers could start mulling extreme options such as parallel privately-owned and operated railway infrastructure, coupled with centralised planning and an evolved role for the railways. This will need a robust policy framework from the Government of India.The time is perhaps also ripe to bring user charge and asset monetisation-driven segments for passengers as well as cargo to the discussion table. Globally, the separation of infrastructure and operations in railways has delivered mixed results, for example in the United Kingdom. The model should be analysed and revisited to understand its potential relevance in the Indian context.The key would be to retrace our steps and align our long-term goals to identify not just incremental changes but also ways to explore bold and path-breaking alternatives that put Indian Railways on a smooth track and bring it up to speed.","Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore.

Budget 2024 capital gains tax changes: The Narendra Modi government is considering suggestions for tweaks in the new long term capital gains tax regime that was announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman in Union Budget 2024.The July 23 budget reduced the LTCG tax on property from 20% to 12.5%. The indexation benefit, which allowed taxpayers to adjust the acquisition cost for inflation before calculating capital gains and thus reduce their tax liability, is proposed to be eliminated for properties purchased on or after April 1, 2001.The government publishes the Cost Inflation Index (CII) annually for this calculation.India Inc is appealing to the government for a gradual shift to the long-term capital gains tax regime proposed in the FY25 budget, which aims to eliminate indexation benefits for property, gold, and other unlisted assets.According to an ET report by Deepshikha Sikarwar, the industry is suggesting alternatives such as a higher tax rate with indexation or a lower rate of 12.5% without indexation, as well as some form of grandfathering for ancestral properties.The finance ministry is currently reviewing these proposals and will discuss them with the Prime Minister's Office. The final decision will be made closer to the date when the Finance Bill reply is to be presented in Parliament, the reports said.Industry groups are expected to submit formal proposals to the finance ministry in the near future.

Budget 2024 adopts multifaceted approach to bolstering manufacturing sector,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2024-adopts-multifaceted-approach-to-bolstering-manufacturing-sector/articleshow/112216383.cms,"By Saurabh Agarwal and Mohit Sharma

Budget 2024 for manufacturing sector : The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth. While the middle class has been offered tax relief, the government's primary focus remains on judicious spending to maximize economic impact. The budget's core themes are employment, skilling, MSME development, and support for the middle class.Largely focus has remained intact on spending money judiciously to ensure that each penny spent creates a ripple effect in the entire economic landscape.Although at first glance, manufacturing might appear to have taken a backseat, a deeper analysis reveals a multifaceted approach to bolstering the sector. Initiatives like employment-linked benefits and internship programs, while primarily aimed at job creation and skill development, indirectly benefit manufacturing companies by expanding the talent pool.Extensive focus on the MSME manufacturing units by way of extending term loan facility for purchase of machinery and equipment without collateral or third-party guarantee, would help companies in augmenting their capital base/ capacity and strengthen the very foundation of the manufacturing ecosystem in the country. Development of a new credit-assessment model by Public Sector Banks to assess MSME credit shall provide much needed regulatory relief to the units.With respect to the large manufacturing entities, while there is no direct fiscal/ tax incentive introduced in this budget, some support has been provided with an extensive focus on development of ‘industrial parks’ in nearly 100 cities under the ‘plug and play’ model. Reforms proposed with respect to land administration, planning and management, shall also ease out acquisition related difficulties often faced by entrepreneurs/ business houses in acquiring lands for manufacturing set-ups.Targeted Customs duty interventions like, rationalization of Customs duty provisions in Mobile phone manufacturing setups, extension of Customs duty exemption on import of capital goods for manufacturing of solar cells and panels, full Customs duty exemption on import of 25 critical minerals,, shall provide the required impetus for enhancing domestic manufacturing environment.Governments’ focus on formulating an Economic Policy Framework to set the scope for next-gen reforms in the country, has a target to improve the productivity of factors of production, namely, land, labour, capital, entrepreneurship and technology. This shall pave the way for enabling achievement of a target of 25% manufacturing sector contribution to the nation’s GDP over the course of next 7-10 years.While the overall outlook is positive, the extension of tax benefits under Section 115BAB for manufacturing entities and the absence of new PLI schemes are notable omissions.The country’s manufacturing base is expanding as is reflective from the continuously increasing tax collections and expanding Purchasing Manager’s Index. It would be pertinent to see how the ground realities evolve vis-à-vis the vision envisaged, in the upcoming Financial Year.","The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth.

Budget 2024: Armed with the vision to propel India to become a developed country by 2047, the Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business thereby providing the required stimulus to the manufacturing sector and enabling large scale job creation.On the Indirect tax front, the industry welcomes the much-needed announcement for a comprehensive review of the rate structure under Customs enabling ease in product classification and dispute reduction.The proposal of lowering of Customs duty on a plethora of raw materials and products including solar cells, critical minerals and bullion are encouraging measures. The rationale behind such reduction clearly indicates support towards domestic manufacturing, deepening value addition and supporting targets in reducing carbon footprint.Relevant amendments under the Customs law have been made to provide increased time limits for re-imports and re-exports to enhance competitiveness of the fledgling MRO sector. The government has extended significant duty reduction and exemption benefits to the healthcare and electronics sectors, continuing the impetus of incentives provided under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme.Since their introduction in March 2020, the PLI schemes have indeed supported in revitalizing the manufacturing sector and strengthening the necessary supply chains. The success achieved in the mobile manufacturing sector has now enabled the Government to reduce customs duties on mobile phones and components, signalling a mature environment. The Budget proposals aim at reproducing similar outcomes for semiconductor and pharmaceutical industry by increasing the budgetary allocation.Buoyed by the increasing revenue collection under GST signalling a shift towards a mature tax regime, this Budget has harmonized the timeframes for the issuance of demand notices and adjudication orders for cases involving fraud, suppression or otherwise. Significant amendments to the GST legislations have been introduced reflecting the recommendations proposed by the GST Council such as regularizing non-levy of GST due to general practice which may turn out to be a breather for certain impacted industries reeling under huge tax demands.The Insurance sector has been provided much relief through the GST council recommendations which have been cemented in the present budget thereby ending long standing disputes on their business practices.The Government's efforts to push forward with its reform agenda are evident as plans to incentivize states for their business reform actions plans and digitalization through the Jan Vishwas Bill 2.0 is proposed. Further, setting up of e-commerce export hubs is envisaged to facilitate easier access to international markets for domestic players.The recent implementation of Budget proposals allows the government to maintain momentum in its reform agenda. These policy measures implicitly reaffirm the significance of India Inc as a crucial element in the development of infrastructure. However, there are still some expectations required to be met to march towards a Viksit Bharat 2047.",The Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business.

Budget 2024 : Real estate, a significant contributor to employment generation, has received a fair bit of attention in Budget 2024-25. Recent years have seen the sector transform rapidly, driven by factors such as favourable government policies, Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, strong economic growth and changing consumer preferences.Added to that, the budgetary focus on job creation, skilling and employment-linked incentives, infrastructure, urban development, rural connectivity, digitalisation and land-related norms, all dovetail to promote growth of the sector.Launched in June 2015, the PMAY aims to provide affordable housing to all eligible beneficiaries. The budget unveiled PMAY Urban 2.0, under which the housing needs of 1 crore urban poor and middle class will be addressed with an investment of Rs 10 lakh crore.The central government’s additional Rs 2.2 lakh crore injection in the next 5 years to make housing more affordable has the potential to revitalise the affordable housing market.Such an approach can play an important role in realising the government's vision of Housing for All and push growth and development. Hence, the significant investment under PMAY Urban 2.0 is expected to alleviate urban housing deficits, spurring construction and economic growth.Steps to introduce technological reforms within the regulatory framework for land, such as digitalisation or GIS mapping of land records, will improve transparency.Rationalisation of stamp duty across states will also be critical to bring in uniformity and initiate land-related reforms such as urban planning, usage and building bylaws.These are steps in the right direction and will boost growth. Moreover, they will improve the ease of property transactions and strengthen municipal finances through increased property taxes. Rationalization of stamp duty with an emphasis on women homebuyers may boost home-buyer sentiment in major cities, too.The budget has also given ample attention to urban and rural development, with rental housing for industrial workers through the public private partnership model, interest subsidies for rental housing, and transit-oriented developments.The proposal to develop investment-ready plug-and-play industrial parks in 100 cities may attract industrial investment, leading to increased demand for industrial real estate and support the growth of ancillary services and residential developments in these regions.Initiatives for industrial parks and rental housing for industrial workers align with the country’s manufacturing goals and addresses worker accommodation needs.These steps are expected to promote industrial growth and stability in labour-intensive sectors, while also creating new opportunities for real estate developers specialising in rental and affordable housing.The changes in long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax, however, have evoked a mixed reaction. The government lowered the long-term capital gains tax from 20% to 12.5%, which is a welcome step. However, this came with the removal of the indexation benefit.The changes could encourage more liquidity in property transactions and potentially increase the effective tax burden depending on the property’s acquisition date.The launch of Phase IV of the PM Gram Sadak Yojana in 25,000 rural habitations will improve connectivity in rural areas, promoting rural development and making these regions more accessible for investment. The primary objective of PMGSY is to build robust, all-weather roads in rural habitations. This initiative focuses on enhancing connectivity and supporting economic development in rural areas.In essence, the budget is geared towards stimulating growth and investment in the real estate sector , fostering a more transparent and investor-friendly environment, and contributing to overall development. It aims to create a balanced and inclusive growth environment by addressing the needs of various segments, including affordable housing, industrial workers and urban infrastructure.The effectiveness of the initiatives, however, hinges on their implementation and continued support of complementary reforms.","The budget unveiled PMAY Urban 2.0, under which the housing needs of 1 crore urban poor and middle class will be addressed with an investment of Rs 10 lakh crore.

New Budget 2024 rule: Why Income Tax Department is likely to issue a huge number of tax notices this month,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-budget-2024-rule-why-income-tax-department-is-likely-to-issue-a-huge-number-of-tax-notices-this-month/articleshow/112186079.cms,"Taxing Times

Income Tax Notice on the way? The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month, as there are concerns that many taxpayers might escape the tax net due to the impending implementation of the new reassessment law on September 1, 2024.According to the amended regulation announced in Budget 2024 , the tax authorities can only go back a maximum of five years to reassess a taxpayer's records if the escaped income is at least Rs 50 lakh, and three years for an amount less than Rs 50 lakh.Previously, they could reassess cases up to 10 years old.According to an ET report, tax officials are now faced with the challenge of compiling and corroborating data on tax and income mismatches for the financial years 2013-14 to 2017-18 within the next few weeks, as these years will become time-barred for reassessment from September 1, 2024.The I-T department relies on information from various sources, such as banks, property registrars, and search findings from the investigation wing, to build reassessment cases.A tax officers' body has raised concerns about the feasibility of issuing notices under Section 148 (or 148A) in a large number of cases within a single month, given the overburdened nature of the jurisdictional assessing officers and the time-consuming process of obtaining sanction from the chief commissioner, who is the specified authority for such notices.Moreover, the law provides taxpayers with the right to explain their position before reassessment orders are finalized, a process that most believe cannot be completed by the end of August.Also Read | ITR refund status for FY 2023-24: How to check income tax refund status online - here’s a step-by-step guide for incometax.gov.in & NSDL websites The Central Board of Direct Taxes ( CBDT ) has been urged by its officers to postpone the effective date of the proposed amendment. However, this suggestion is unlikely to be well-received by corporations and high net worth individuals.""Capping the reassessment period at five years was a great decision as it would reduce hassles and litigation. But if the department fears there could be a genuine loss of revenue as it may not be possible to wrap up several matters by August 31, the government can think of strict parameters where time-bound cases can be selectively reopened - based on trails of steps taken in identifying escaped income,"" said Mitil Chokshi, partner at CA firm Chokshi & Chokshi.""Taxpayers may expect a rush of reassessment notices in August 2024. These notices are likely to be for the AYs 2018-19 and prior to that. It is pertinent to note that the Bombay High Court in a recent ruling in a case of Hexaware Technologies has taken a view on a proviso introduced in 2021, which can be interpreted to mean that AY 2017-18 (and prior years) got time barred on March 31, 2024. These reassessment notices (for AYs 2017-18 and prior) are likely to rake up new interpretation issues in the already muddled reassessment provisions,"" said Ashish Mehta, partner at law firm Khaitan & Co.The current situation is similar to the conflict between the Income Tax office and taxpayers in 2021. The reassessment law was amended in April 2021, allowing the tax office to reopen 10-year-old tax returns if the total undisclosed income exceeded Rs 50 lakh and reassess 4-year-old matters if the amount was less than Rs 50 lakh.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? However, this change led to over 10,000 writ petitions being filed by companies, arguing that they were not given sufficient time to explain and that the notices were issued without considering the carve-out that cases which couldn't be reopened earlier couldn't be reassessed under the new law.The Supreme Court invoked its extraordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution on May 4, 2022, to uphold all reassessment notices issued after March 31, 2021. However, the court left room for judicial proceedings based on the merits of each case, and several such matters are currently pending before the court.","The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month.

Latest NPS rules, news: In the Union Budget 2024 speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced two new initiatives with regard to National Pension Scheme (NPS) - extension of NPS 14% employer contribution benefits to private setcor and the intended launch of NPS Vatsalya.Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries, bringing it at par with the provisions available for government employees.Sriram Iyer, CEO, HDFC Pension Management told ET that with this move the “ground rules have been harmonised among government and non-government employees, which is a positive step.”Effectively, this means that now, private-sector employees can choose to reduce the taxable portion of employers’ contribution to their NPS corpus, thereby paying less tax and leaving greater funds in their pension deposits.“Employees will benefit from tax savings . More importantly, the 40% increase in contribution will have a significant impact on the terminal value of the retirement corpus,” remarked Iyer. The extended savings will “help in retirement planning, working as an option that is at par with the Provident Fund,” Dinesh Rohira, CEO & Founder, 5nance.com was quoted as saying.Moreover, the endeavour aims to increase NPS penetration by increasing tax incentives for the private sector, providing them a social security-cushion post-retirement.The scheme’s motive to widen the NPS subscriber base may not prove to be flawlessly effective, however. This is explained by Agrees Mrin Agarwal, Founder, Finsafe India: “While it’s good that the limit has been raised, it may not increase adoption as employees need to be educated in a big way. Also, the benefit is only for the salaried opting for the new tax regime,” she says.The mandatory contribution to the EPF, too, threatens to relegate the provisions of NPS under the umbrella of near-superfluity. This sentiment is echoed by Varun Sahay, a software engineer in a Delhi-based IT company: “When 12% of my salary is already deducted for the EPF, why should I put in more in the NPS and cut my take-home pay?”Rohira feels otherwise. “There’s no competition between the NPS and EPF as employees can contribute to both and build a 3-4 times bigger corpus while earning 3-4% higher returns via marketlinked options in the NPS,” he counters.Also Check | New Tax Regime 2023 vs 2024 After Budget: How Much Income Tax Will Salaried Taxpayers Save & How Do New Tax Slabs Compare To Old Regime? Top 10 Points You Must Know To jumpstart retirement savings for children, a new initiative called NPS Vatsalya has been unveiled in the Budget. This scheme allows parents and guardians to contribute to a minor's account, which can be converted into a regular NPS account once the child reaches adulthood.""It provides a very long duration for reaping the compounding benefits and accumulating a huge bounty at a later age. This can be a good way to plan a better future for kids who may not opt for a service segment in the future,"" says Rohira. Sriram Iyer agrees, stating, ""It’s a good move to help the child start his retirement journey. Even if a parent starts when the child is 10 years old, by the time he starts working, it can be a solid foundation for the compounding journey after that.""However, some experts question the utility of a product with such a long lock-in period, especially when parents cannot use the funds for essential goals like their child’s education amidst soaring education costs of 11-12%.""Parents are struggling to save for their own retirement, so it might be a bit of a stretch to expect them to save for their kids’ retirement. The need of the hour is a market-linked product that allows withdrawals only for the child’s education,"" says Mrin Agarwal, Founder of Finsafe India.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? Though the NPS permits partial withdrawals, it allows only 25% of the corpus after three years of joining, and this can be done only three times during the entire tenure. A premature exit before 60 years with 100% withdrawal is only possible if the corpus is less than Rs.2.5 lakh, an amount insufficient for most children's goals.""In its current form, there won’t be any uptake,"" asserts Agarwal. Rohira concurs, ""It’s a vanilla product with a lock-in, which does not make it very attractive and it may not take off. However, the government may optimise it and introduce new features later."" Iyer adds, ""This is just a start and there may be more subscriber-friendly features as we take it to the market. The regulator is proactive and open to feedback.""","Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries.

Gold import duty cut: Why Indians may not find buying gold from Dubai as attractive post Budget 2024,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-import-duty-cut-why-indians-may-not-find-buying-gold-from-dubai-as-attractive-post-budget-2024/articleshow/112097671.cms,"Gold import duty cut: Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group, estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India.

Gold import duty cut in Budget 2024: The recent reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai. Indian jewellers with stores in both India and the UAE believe that the narrowed duty differential will result in lower gold prices in India, making it less attractive for Indians to purchase gold in Dubai.The emirate had attracted gold-enthusiast Indians following a steep rise in customs duty in India in July 2022. In the fiscal 2024-25 budget, the duty on gold imports was more than halved.The duty cut is also expected to boost gold jewellery production in India, particularly the popular 'Kolkatti' jewellery from Kolkata, which is favored by Indian expats in Dubai and tourists from various countries. This move will encourage gold artisans to create new designs in both heavyweight and lightweight jewellery, attracting consumers to purchase gold from India.According to an ET report, Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group , estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India as Indian tourists who previously bought jewellery in Dubai will now prefer to shop in India. However, Indian expats living in Dubai and other customers may continue to buy from the UAE.Also Read | Gold losing sheen? Government cuts gold bond issuance target as investors look at better alternatives Rajiv Popley, director at Popley & Sons, believes that the perception of overseas gold being cheaper than in India is merely a mindset. He points out that the labour cost is significantly lower in India, and with the introduction of mandatory hallmarking and HUID numbers, the purity of gold in India is no longer a concern.Furthermore, NRIs in Dubai do not receive VAT refunds, and Indians travelling abroad only receive about 60% of the VAT back on their gold purchases. Gold trade analyst Bhargav Baidya suggests that the 1% duty differential between gold jewellery in India and Dubai will be offset by Indian jewellers offering discounts to retain and attract customers.Saurabh Gadgil, chairman of PNG Jewellers, notes that Indian import duty is now on par with the US, allowing Indian jewellers to offer competitive prices compared to other countries worldwide. The reduced customs duty is expected to make gold purchases in India more attractive and convenient for Indian consumers, potentially leading to a significant shift in their gold shopping preferences.","The reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers.

Gold Bonds losing sheen

Gold losing sheen? The government has reduced its target for issuing gold bonds in the financial year 2024-25 by 38% compared to the previous interim budget goal, according to a senior official. The revised target stands at Rs 18,500 crore, down from Rs 29,638 crore estimated in the interim budget and Rs 26,852 crore (revised estimate) in 2023-24.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told ET ""The decision followed a reassessment of various factors, including investor demand, other investment products and uncertainties around the global economy, as the situation has changed since the interim budget in February.""After accounting for redemptions, the net issuances of sovereign gold bonds are now estimated at Rs 15,000 crore for this fiscal year, a significant decrease from the Rs 26,138 crore projected in the interim budget and Rs 25,352 crore in the revised estimate for 2023-24.Harish Galipelli, director at ILA Commodities India, attributed this shift to retail investors increasingly opting for equities in anticipation of better returns. He also noted that people are uncertain about the potential for further increases in gold prices in the short-to-medium term following a recent rally. Additionally, Galipelli pointed out that savings in rural areas have been impacted by retail inflation and other factors.The gold bond and gold monetisation schemes were introduced by the government in late 2015 to discourage the physical purchase of precious metals and reduce imports, thereby mitigating the negative impact on the current account deficit.The gross collection through these two schemes is now projected to be Rs 20,030 crore in 2024-25, compared to Rs 31,168 crore in the interim budget and Rs 28,240 crore (revised estimate) in the previous fiscal year. Similarly, the net collection is estimated at Rs 16,433 crore, down from Rs 27,571 crore in the interim budget and Rs 26,653 crore in the previous year. However, the estimates for the gold monetisation scheme remain unchanged from the interim budget level.Also Read | Budget 2024: Duty cuts on gold, silver, platinum, and diamonds to make jewellery more affordable The sovereign gold bond scheme targets investors who view gold as an investment, encouraging them to purchase paper gold instead of physical gold.On the other hand, the gold monetisation scheme aims to bring out idle gold held by households, temple trusts, and others to increase domestic supply. Both schemes were designed to curb gold imports, which, along with crude oil, have been significant contributors to India's current account deficit. Gold bond issuances had moderated after reaching Rs 16,049 crore during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020-21, before experiencing a surge in 2023-24.","The government has reduced its target for issuing gold bonds in the financial year 2024-25 by 38% compared to the previous interim budget goal.

FOMO grips China stock buyers on ‘epic’ trading day before break,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/fomo-grips-china-stock-buyers-on-epic-trading-day-before-break/articleshow/113822270.cms,"The Fear and Greed Indicator of the Shanghai Composite Index, rose to the highest since 2015 on Monday.

‘Painful Time’

For Shao Qifeng, the frenzy in Chinese stock trading in the last five sessions was a first in his 15-year market career.The Beijing-based chief investment officer at Ying An Asset Management Co. has been receiving non-stop client inquiries in his WeChat groups asking whether this is the time to buy stocks, after authorities unveiled a stimulus blitz last week.“I think this means we are in the second phase of a bull market, when stocks are getting wide attention,” Shao said. “On the surface, I’m keeping my cool, but deep down in my heart I’m celebrating.”Shao’s experience was shared by many stock investors in China where the benchmark index posted the biggest gain since 2008 on Monday, entering a bull market. The rush into the market before a weeklong holiday has also sent trading turnover to a record high. The interest was so intense that broker applications collapsed and requests for opening trading accounts surged, according to local media.The latest leap came after three of China’s largest cities relaxed rules for homebuyers, while the central bank also moved to lower mortgage rates. The measures were among the key elements of a sweeping stimulus package released last Tuesday that also included interest rate cuts, freeing-up of cash for banks, as well as liquidity support for stocks. Meanwhile, the Golden Dragon index of US-listed Chinese stocks rallied 4.7%.While Chinese stocks have produced multiple false dawns in recent years, there appears to be growing conviction that this time may be different given the sense of urgency that authorities have shown to achieve their ambitious economic growth target of around 5% this year.The surging retail interest has even prompted some funds to impose a cap on how much people can buy. Beijing Jiuyang Runquan Capital Management, for example, set a one-million-yuan ($142,603) limit on fund subscriptions for investors.For Winnie Wu, chief China equity strategist at BofA Securities, caution still lingers with many of her clients asking whether it’s time to take profit after a few days of strong gains.“It’s really hard to either chase the rally or adjust positions. It’s a very exciting time, but it is also a very difficult, challenging, painful time for many investors,” she said.So far, the fear of missing out is palpable. Brokerages, typically seen as a barometer for market sentiment, led gains Monday with many posting double-digit jump. A Bloomberg Intelligence gauge of Chinese property developers rose as much as 15.7%. Hedge funds are selling US technology stocks and piling into mining and materials firms. Meanwhile, iron ore spiked about 11% as investors bet that China’s efforts to ease property woes will improve demand from the world’s top consumer of the steel-making ingredient.The pivot towards risk assets has sent the country’s ten-year sovereign bonds reeling Monday, extending their biggest weekly drop in a decade.The Fear and Greed Indicator of the Shanghai Composite Index, which measures the buying and selling momentum for the stock benchmark popular among China’s retail investors, rose to the highest since 2015 on Monday.“This is an epic day in the Chinese market history,” said Hao Hong, chief economist at Grow Investment Group. “This is one of the happiest days” of his 30 years covering the Chinese market, he added.Some are urging cooler heads, after being burned chasing past rallies in Chinese stocks.“I must confess, after busily gobbling on this week-long policy banquet, my concern about a potential replay of the previous disappointing cycle lingers,” said Hebe Chen, an analyst at IG Markets Ltd. “It’s still too early to tell if this ‘Golden-Week rush’ will blossom into a true gold rush or fizzle out into another mirage.”",The Shanghai Composite Index posted the biggest gain since 2008 on Monday.

The 2024 CBI Index has unveiled the leading countries for Citizenship by Investment (CBI) programmes, showcasing more than 12 global jurisdictions.This year’s edition, themed 'Transparency Meets Transition: A CBI Reset', delivered an in-depth assessment of the industry’s evolving landscape, highlighting both the challenges and opportunities faced by the sector, along with its ongoing pursuit of transparency and cooperation.For the fourth consecutive year, St. Kitts and Nevis secured the top spot in the Citizenship by Investment (CBI) industry, earning an impressive overall score of 84 percent.Dominica maintained its position at the second spot with a score of 80 percent, marking its second year in this rank. Close behind, Grenada claimed third place with 77 percent, while Saint Lucia and Antigua and Barbuda both garnered 74 percent, taking the fourth and fifth positions, respectively.CBI Index 2024.The latest report revealed that the five Eastern Caribbean nations offering Citizenship by Investment (CBI) programmes have dominated the top rankings, securing all five leading positions.Praising the Caribbean islands for consistently maintaining their top spots among 12 jurisdictions, the CBI Index stated,In contrast, European programmes, including those of Malta, Türkiye, and Austria, also performed well, securing high positions in the rankings.Türkiye's CBI programme ranked 7th with a score of 63%, while Egypt moved up to the 9th spot with 59%. Both programmes experienced improvements when compared with the previous year, with Türkiye advancing by one position and Egypt increasing its score by two percentage points.Jordan and Cambodia concluded the rankings, with Cambodia descending to the twelfth position this year, having been previously surpassed by Jordan. Cambodia's score of 49% indicated a slight decline in its performance.However, while India does not offer second citizenship, India's Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) card offers a unique opportunity for individuals of Indian origin to maintain their connection to the country while enjoying the benefits of multiple entry and multi-purpose visas. This allows them to visit India frequently and participate in various activities without the need for a second citizenship.One of the significant issues which were addressed by the CBI Index 2024 isin the Citizenship by Investment industry.According to the Index,The Index also mentions that comprehensive due diligence and compliance are significant within the CBI industry and countries of respective programmes have tailored compliance processes to address the complexity of applicants to ensure that vetting remains within the parameters of the regulations which govern the programmes.This year's CBI Index is based on nine pillars of excellence, which form the foundation of the entire ranking system.These pillars include standard of living, freedom of movement, investment options and threshold, mandatory travel or residence, citizenship timeline, ease of processing, due diligence, family, and certainty of product.St. Kitts and Nevis emerged as the top performer, achieving a perfect score of 10 in four key pillars: Mandatory Travel or Residence, Ease of Processing, Due Diligence, and Certainty of Product.Malta earned the highest score for standard of living, with nine points, due to its strong performance across sub-indicators such as relative safety, life expectancy, and freedom.Both Malta and Austria led the freedom of movement pillar with perfect scores of 10, while the Caribbean nations of St. Kitts and Nevis, Antigua and Barbuda, Saint Lucia, and Grenada followed with scores of seven.In the investment options and threshold pillar, Antigua and Barbuda, Egypt, and Saint Lucia received the highest score of 9, with St. Kitts and Nevis close behind at 8.Dominica, Grenada, St. Kitts and Nevis, and Saint Lucia all topped the mandatory travel or residence pillar, each scoring 10.For the citizenship timeline pillar, Dominica, Jordan, and Vanuatu ranked first due to their four-month application processing times.In the ease of processing pillar, Dominica, Grenada, and St. Kitts and Nevis shared the top rank with Malta.St. Kitts and Nevis stood alone at the top of the due diligence pillar, one of the most critical categories, with a perfect score of 10.Antigua and Barbuda and Grenada were recognized as the most family-friendly programmes for 2024, offering accommodating application structures that include siblings, parents, and grandparents of both the main applicant and their spouse.Lastly, St. Kitts and Nevis was the only country to score a perfect 10 in the certainty of product pillar, reflecting its swift response to international pressures on Caribbean CBI programmes.The CBI Index highlights the growing importance of adaptability in Citizenship by Investment (CBI) offerings, noting that several changes were implemented this year to ensure programmes remain fit for purpose amid shifting global events, industry expectations, and standards. These adaptations have included regional integration, adjustments to investment thresholds, and improvements in compliance and due diligence.“The Citizenship by Investment (CBI) industry has seen many twists and turns this year, but two key themes stand out: transition and transparency,” the CBI Index noted.One of the most significant changes in the industry, according to the Index, was the introduction of the Memorandum of Agreement (MoA). This MoA exemplified the central theme of the 2024 Index: where transparency meets transition.The report explained that the MoA harmonized practices across the five Caribbean CBI programmes, establishing minimum investment thresholds, facilitating information sharing between Unit heads, and setting uniform operational standards. The agreement mandated a minimum investment threshold of US$200,000, providing greater consistency in programme costs.","The 2024 CBI Index has unveiled the leading countries for Citizenship by Investment (CBI) programmes, showcasing more than 12 global jurisdictions.

According to a report by Indiaspora , Indian immigrants have founded or co-founded 72 of the 358 unicorns that have emerged in the United States since 2018, making them the most prolific immigrant founders in the unicorn universe.

, Indian immigrants have founded or co-founded 72 of the 358 unicorns that have emerged in the United States since 2018, making them the most prolific immigrant founders in the unicorn universe. This impressive figure accounts for about 20% of immigrant-founded unicorns in the US, highlighting the unique contributions of Indian-origin entrepreneurs to the American innovation landscape.

to the American innovation landscape. Collectively, these unicorns are valued at over $195 billion and employ approximately 55,000 people, making Indian-Americans a formidable force in the entrepreneurial world.

These aren’t just tech whizzes chasing the next big IPO. They are storytellers, risk-takers, and cross-cultural navigators who have seamlessly blended the hustle of Mumbai’s markets with the ambition of Wall Street.

With valuations soaring beyond $195 billion, Indian-led unicorns have become not only economic powerhouses but symbols of a new kind of American Dream—one that speaks in the languages of code, venture capital, and a diaspora’s insatiable drive for success.

Why it matters

The remarkable rise of Indian-American founders in the unicorn landscape is a testament to their pivotal role in driving US innovation, economic growth, and technological advancement.

Despite representing only 1.5% of the US population, Indian-Americans are vastly overrepresented in high-impact entrepreneurial roles, reshaping industries like enterprise technology, healthcare, fintech, and consumer goods.

Their influence underscores the broader impact of the Indian diaspora on the US economy and society, particularly in sectors that define the future of business and technology.

A new vanguard of leadership

Indian-Americans aren’t just building companies; they’re leading them at unprecedented levels. In 2023, sixteen Fortune 500 companies had CEOs of Indian origin, a testament to the community’s growing corporate clout.

companies had CEOs of Indian origin, a testament to the community’s growing corporate clout. From Satya Nadella at Microsoft to Sundar Pichai at Alphabet, these leaders are redefining what it means to be at the top in America’s biggest companies.

The presence of Indian CEOs in corporate America is not just a statistical quirk—it’s a statement about the kind of leadership the modern business world craves: bold, diverse, and globally minded.

From Bay Area to Bengaluru

The allure of Silicon Valley has always been its promise: come here, bring your ideas, and the sky is the limit. For Indian founders, that promise has been a lifeline—and a launchpad. Companies like Rippling, the workforce management platform, and Innovaccer, a healthcare tech giant, are reshaping their respective industries with the sort of disruptive flair that would make any VC drool.

These founders often carry a hybrid identity, a fusion of Ivy League polish and the entrepreneurial grit honed in India’s teeming cities.

""Approximately 20% of Indian unicorns and many startups have co-founders who have leveraged US higher education into successful ventures,"" the report said.

These entrepreneurs are channeling degrees from institutions like Stanford and MIT into ventures that span everything from artificial intelligence to financial technology. PhonePe and Dream11 are living examples of US-educated founders Turing their dreams into reality in India.

The big picture

Indian-Americans have long been associated with excellence in education, professional success, and a strong presence in high-skilled sectors like technology, medicine, and engineering.

Nearly 78% of Indian-Americans hold at least a bachelor’s degree—more than double the US national average of 36%. This focus on education and achievement has created a pipeline of talent that feeds into leadership roles in some of the most innovative companies in the world. With around 320,000 work visas allocated to Indian professionals in 2022-2023,

Indian-origin individuals represent 73% of high-skilled work visa holders, reflecting their critical role in filling talent gaps across key industries in the US.

This strong educational foundation has translated into entrepreneurial success, particularly in the startup ecosystem. Indian-Americans have founded unicorns that span a wide array of sectors, demonstrating a versatile and innovative spirit.

What’s next

Over the last five years, Indian-Americans have quietly risen as the champions of the unicorns - billion-dollar startups- ecosystem, transforming Silicon Valley boardrooms into global hubs of innovation.The future looks promising for Indian-American entrepreneurs as they continue to expand their influence across the US and global markets.The trend of deepening US-India ties, particularly in the tech sector, will likely fuel further opportunities for collaboration and growth. The success of Indian-origin unicorns sets the stage for even more dynamic interactions between the two countries, as talent, capital, and ideas flow across borders.With both nations increasingly looking to each other as strategic partners, there is immense potential for Indian-American founders to tap into burgeoning markets in areas like artificial intelligence, biotechnology, and clean energy. The ongoing expansion of the Indo-US economic corridor is expected to enhance this momentum, fostering an environment where innovation thrives. As US companies invest in India to access its growing customer base and skilled workforce, and Indian companies continue to invest in the US, the entrepreneurial landscape for Indian-Americans will only become more vibrant.","Indian immigrants have founded or co-founded 72 of the 358 unicorns that have emerged in the United States since 2018.

The US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) has approved Bristol Myers Squibb ’s new oral medicine, Cobenfy , for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults. This approval marks the first new type of schizophrenia medicine in several decades that reduces the mental illness symptoms without the common side effects .“Today’s landmark approval of our first-in-class treatment for schizophrenia marks an important milestone for the community.After more than 30 years, there is now an entirely new pharmacological approach for schizophrenia — one that has the potential to change the treatment paradigm,” said Chris Boerner, board chair and CEO of Bristol Myers Squibb. “As we reenter the field of neuropsychiatry, we are dedicated to changing the conversation around serious mental illness, beginning with today’s approval for schizophrenia.”Bristol Myers Squibb plans to make Cobenfy, a twice-daily pill, available by late October. The drug will cost $1,850 per month, or $22,500 annually, before insurance and rebates.Schizophrenia affects around 2.8 million people in the United States, impacting how they think, feel, and behave. Symptoms of Schizophrenia usually appear in early adulthood and vary greatly among individuals, making the condition hard to diagnose and manage. Current treatments can be effective, but up to 60% of patients find them inadequate or experience intolerable side effects.“For people living with schizophrenia, it's often difficult to find a treatment that works for them. Having a variety of treatment options gives patients and healthcare providers the tools to help manage this serious condition,” said Gordon Lavigne, CEO of the Schizophrenia & Psychosis Action Alliance. “People living with schizophrenia want and deserve more. Today’s approval provides a new option as people with schizophrenia move forward with proper support to rebuild their lives.”","The US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) has approved Bristol Myers Squibb ’s new oral medicine, Cobenfy, for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults.
