Indian saffron rules! The ongoing geopolitical tensions in West Asia have led to a significant reduction in saffron supplies from Iran, which is proving to be advantageous for Indian saffron producers and traders. As a result, the prices of Indian saffron, grown in certain regions of Jammu and Kashmir , have surged by over 20% in the wholesale market and approximately 27% in retail outlets over the past month, according to producers and traders.According to an ET report, currently, the finest quality Indian saffron is being sold at Rs 3.5-3.6 lakh per kg in the wholesale market, up from Rs 2.8-3 lakh before the recent escalation of tensions in West Asia.In retail, the price can reach as high as Rs 4.95 lakh per kg, which is equivalent to the cost of nearly 70 grams of gold based on Friday's rate of Rs 72,633 for 10 grams.Iran, which produces around 430 tonnes annually, is responsible for 90% of the world's saffron production. The spice is renowned for its delicate flavor and is used in various applications, including food, cosmetics, and medicines.Noor ul Amin Bin Khalik, owner of Amin-Bin-Khalik Co in Srinagar, told the financial daily, “Absence of Iran in the global markets has pushed up the Indian saffron prices . India also imports saffron from Iran. That too has trickled down after the geopolitical tensions started. Prices are going up almost every day.”Despite being recognized for its superior quality and receiving the Geographical Indication (GI) tag in 2020, Kashmiri saffron production has declined significantly over the past 13 years. The current output is less than 3 tonnes, which is less than a third of the production 13 years ago, while the annual demand stands at 60-65 tonnes.Also Read | Is Chinese garlic being smuggled into India? Why customs has sounded high alert Nilesh P Mehta, cofounder of Chennai-based Bell Saffron, whose family has been in the business for more than 50 years, commented, ""The Middle East tension, coupled with lower production, has impacted the prices of saffron… Also, the GI tag has made Indian saffron costlier in the world markets.""Known as kesar in Hindi, India exports saffron to various countries including the UAE, the US, Australia, Nepal, and Canada. The production of saffron is a labor-intensive process, requiring the filaments from 160-180 flowers to make just one gram of the spice.In addition to Pampore district, saffron is cultivated in Budgam, the outskirts of Srinagar, and the Kishtwar district of Jammu, with the crop year commencing in October.Also Read | When will gold prices hit the Rs 2 lakh mark? Over the years, saffron production in the Union Territory has experienced a significant decline. According to Arjun Munda, the union agriculture and farmers welfare minister, saffron output decreased from 8 tonnes in 2010-11 to 2.6 tonnes in 2023-24, representing a 67.5% reduction based on estimates from the Office of Financial Commissioner (Revenue) of Jammu and Kashmir. ""However, during the past year, from 2022-23 to 2023-24, saffron production has marginally increased by 4%,"" he added in February.Senior trade officials, who wished to remain anonymous, attributed the decline in saffron production in the Pampore region to the establishment of new cement factories. The delicate flowers are adversely affected by dust and pollution, making it impossible to grow the crop in the surrounding areas, thereby impacting both the quantity and quality of the saffron produced.As a result, farmers in the vicinity have either sold their land to these industries or left it uncultivated, according to people in the trade. Furthermore, unpredictable weather conditions only serve to exacerbate the concerns.The Kashmir valley is home to several varieties of saffron, including Mongra, which is known for its deep color and rich aroma and flavor. The Lacha variety contains both red and yellow parts, while Zarda, another type of saffron, is used in face packs, beauty creams, and moisturizers.","Indian saffron prices have surged by over 20% in the wholesale market and approximately 27% in retail outlets over the past month, according to producers and traders. Iran, which produces around 430 tonnes annually, is responsible for 90% of the world's saffron production.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110029730,imgsize-38330,width-400,resizemode-4/110029730.jpg"

The mining sector grew 1.2% in March, slower than the 6.8% recorded in March last year. The manufacturing sector expansion was consistent with other data such as the PMI for manufacturing, which had predicted stable expansion for the sector on the back of robust domestic demand.The consumer durables sector grew 9.5% in March compared with a contraction of 8% in the year earlier period, while consumer non-durables grew 4.9% during the month compared with a contraction of 1.9% in the year earlier period.The capital goods sector, which is seen as a gauge for investment activity, rose 6.1% in March, slower than the 10% recorded in March last year, while the infrastructure/construction goods sector rose 6.9% during the month, slightly slower than the 7.2% in March last year.""On the consumption front, output of consumer durables grew by 9.5% whereas non-durables output growth turned positive, rising by 4.9% following two consecutive months of contraction. However, the sustenance of this trend remains to be monitored in the upcoming months,"" said Rajani Sinha, chief economist at ratings agency CareEdge. ""Upbeat performance in the infrastructure/construction goods segment remained supportive of the growth in industrial activity and we expect this momentum to continue going forward,"" said SinhaShe said the consumption scenario remained mixed in FY24 with urban demand showing resilience while rural demand continued to lag. ""However, expectation of a good monsoon, moderating inflation, and signs of pick-up in rural demand are positives for the overall consumption scenario. Thus, a broad-based and durable improvement in consumption remains the key monitorable this fiscal,"" said Sinha.","The manufacturing sector rose 5.2% in March, higher than the 1.5% posted in March last year.

"‘Steel frame introduced by Britishers has rusted’: Former RBI governor Subbarao's sharp remarks on IAS, civil services reforms",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/steel-frame-introduced-by-britishers-has-rusted-former-rbi-governors-sharp-remarks-on-ias-civil-services-reforms/articleshow/110030657.cms,"India’s civil services are like a steel frame that has rusted, and needs to be restored to its original lustre, says former RBI Governor Duvvuri Subbarao. According to a PTI report, in his recently published book, ""Just A Mercenary?: Notes from My Life and Career,"" Subbarao asserts that India's civil services require reform and reinvention. He argues that the ""steel frame"" established by the British to govern India has undoubtedly rusted over time.Subbarao, who has held various positions, including that of Union finance secretary, also addresses the gender gap within the Indian Administrative Service ( IAS ) in his book.Subbarao was quoted as saying, ""The steel frame has certainly rusted.""The civil services examination, conducted annually by the Union Public Service Commission ( UPSC ), consists of three stages: preliminary, mains, and personality test (interview). This rigorous process selects officers for the IAS (Indian Administrative Service) , IFS (Indian Foreign Service), IPS (Indian Police Service), and other prestigious services.Despite the need for reform, Subbarao maintains that a country as vast and diverse as India still requires a generalist service like the IAS. However, he emphasizes that the service must be reformed and even reinvented in many aspects. ""The solution is not to throw away the rusted frame but to bring it back to its original lustre,"" he said.Also Read | Sanjeev Sanyal's UPSC reality check: Dream to be Elon Musk, or Mukesh Ambani, why a Joint Secretary? Subbarao notes that when the IAS was established shortly after Independence, succeeding the colonial-era Indian Civil Service (ICS), it was regarded as the homegrown solution to the immense task of nation-building.IAS officers spearheaded this effort, constructing an impressive development administration network from the ground up and earning the service a formidable reputation for competence, commitment, and integrity. However, in subsequent decades, the reputation began to unravel, with ineptitude, indifference, and corruption creeping in, according to Subbarao.Subbarao expressed concern over the negative perception of civil servants, shaped by a growing minority of officers who have strayed from their duties.Recently, economist Sanjeev Sanyal said that people should give the UPSC or the Union Public Service Commission exam only and only if they really want to be an administrator. Speaking during “The Neon Show” podcast by Siddhartha Ahluwalia, Sanjeev Sanyal said that Indians suffer from “poverty of aspiration”.Sanjeev Sanyal is a member of the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister (EAC-PM). He advocates that young people should look at other alternatives. “At the end of it if you must dream, surely you should dream to be Elon Musk, or Mukesh Ambani, why did you dream to be Joint Secretary?” he asked.","Former RBI Governor Duvvuri Subbarao says India's civil services require reform and reinvention.

New mutual fund KYC rules : New KYC (Know Your Customer) rules for mutual fund investors came into effect on April 1, 2024. Under new rules, investors must be "" KYC Validated "" to invest in any mutual fund scheme without extra paperwork. As per an ET report, if they already have ""KYC Registered"" or ""KYC Verified"" status, they can keep their current investments.However, if they want to invest in new schemes, they need to submit official documents again with their application.According to FAQs from CAMS, the registrar and transfer agent for mutual funds, you get ""KYC Validated"" status when the KYC Registration Agency (KRA) can confirm your Proof of Address and Proof of Identity with official sources like the Income Tax Department database or Aadhaar. If your PAN and Aadhaar are linked or don't need to be, and your email and/or mobile are verified, then you get the ""KYC Validated"" status. This means you can invest in different mutual fund schemes without having to submit KYC documents again, as long as your information hasn't changed. Using Aadhaar for KYC makes this process easier because KRA can directly confirm the data.CAMS explains that if the KYC Registration Agency (KRA) can't confirm your Proof of Address or Proof of Identity with their sources but your email and/or mobile are verified, and your PAN and Aadhaar are linked or don't need to be, then your KYC status is marked as ""KYC Registered."" In this case, you can invest with other SEBI-registered intermediaries, but you'll need to provide KYC documents again, even if your information hasn't changed.To change your KYC status from ""KYC Registered"" or ""KYC Verified"" to ""KYC Validated,"" you need to use Aadhaar as an Officially Valid Document (OVD). Without Aadhaar, the KYC Registration Agency (KRA) cannot independently validate your information, which is required for ""KYC Validated"" status.Amol Joshi, the founder of PlanRupee Investment Services , says that using Aadhaar for KYC seems to be the only way to get ""KYC Validated"" status. This allows investors to put money into new and existing mutual funds without needing extra KYC paperwork.Abdulla Chaudhari, Head of Investor Services at Edelweiss Mutual Fund, says that investing in mutual funds depends on your residential status and KYC status. If you're a resident individual with ""KYC Verified"" or ""KYC Registered"" status, you can continue investing in your existing mutual funds. However, if you want to invest in a different fund house for the first time, you need to submit a KYC modification request along with your investment application.If you have ""KYC Validated"" status, you can invest in any mutual fund without needing to submit additional KYC documents. Non-Resident Indian (NRI) investors, on the other hand, must submit a KYC modification in all cases unless they have ""KYC Validated"" status. Although using Aadhaar for KYC isn't required, it simplifies the process and avoids the need for multiple KYC modifications across different fund houses.To check your KYC status, you can visit the website CVLKRA.com. Look for the ""KYC Inquiry"" tab, and you'll find your KYC status there.If a mutual fund investor wants ""KYC Validated"" status, they need to go through the re-KYC process. Some investors can do this online, while others need to do it offline.CAMS (Computer Age Management Services) has released an updated list of documents that can be used as Officially Valid Documents (OVDs) for proof of identity and proof of address.","KYC (Know Your Customer) rules for mutual fund investors came into effect on April 1, 2024.

India’s 1st aerotropolis in Delhi to get the country's largest mall in IGI Airport’s Aerocity! Top 10 things to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/indias-1st-aerotropolis-in-delhi-to-get-the-countrys-largest-mall-in-igi-airports-aerocity-top-10-things-to-know/articleshow/110038041.cms,"The leasable area in Aerocity will increase from the current 15 lakh square feet to over one crore square feet by 2029, with the expansion taking place in two phases. The global business district will be further expanded by an additional 65 lakh sq feet, resulting in a total of 1.8 crore sq feet of leasable area for offices, retail, food courts, and an entertainment-focused mega mall, along with public spaces. Bharti Realty, which won the bid for developing Aerocity, has a lease that is coterminous with DIAL's lease for developing and operating the airport, while the ownership remains with the state. Phase 2 will see Aerocity getting Worldmark 4, 5, 6 & 7 with 35 lakh sq feet leasable area and India's largest mall sprawled over 28 lakh sq feet — three times as large as the existing Vasant Kunj malls, SK Sayal, MD & CEO, Bharti Realty told TOI. Underground parking for over 8,000 cars is also planned. Bharti is focusing on developing the mega mall, which Sayal said would become India's biggest when it opens by 2027. ""We have sent teams across the world and are developing the mall as the country's largest indoor entertainment destination offering the most sought after global entertainment genres,"" he added. Currently, Aerocity has 5,000 hotel rooms across 11 leading hotels. Upon completion of Phase 2, the room count will increase to 7,000 across 16 hotels, with new additions like St Regis and JW Marriott Marquis. Phase 3, set to begin in 2025 and be completed by 2029, will add 40 lakh sq feet of leasable commercial space along the Northern Access Road connecting Mahipalpur and Terminals 2 and 3. These will be offices with retail space on the ground floor, forming a boundaryless district linked by cycle tracks and walkways. Sayal anticipates Aerocity to have 20 lakh people working there and an annual footfall of at least three crore upon completion. By then, IGI could be handling over 10 crore passengers annually and replacing T2 with a much larger T4, increasing the airport's yearly capacity to over 14 crore flyers. To handle the increased footfall, DIAL is developing India's first interstate multi-modal transport hub near the Aerocity metro station. This hub will likely incorporate an interstate bus terminus, Delhi Metro's upcoming Phase 4 line, and the Rapid Rail Transit System station, including the station for the automated passenger mover or air train. Currently, DIAL and the Union aviation ministry are discussing the number of stops the proposed air train linking T1 on one side and T3/2 (or T4 in place of T2 by the end of this decade) should have. While the airport operator favors two air train stations in Aerocity, the ministry prefers fewer stops to ensure quick intra-terminal transfers. "" Worldmark Aerocity will be the world's most well-connected global business district with different modes of transport available. People coming from Meerut, Alwar or Panipat will reach here within 45 minutes on the upcoming RRTS. The mega mall will have parking space for thousands of cars,"" said Sayal.

By 2027, Indira Gandhi International Airport 's Aerocity will feature India's largest mall , as part of a massive $2.5 billion expansion project that will transform the country's first aerotropolis over the next five years, according to a TOI report by Saurabh Sinha.We take a look at top 10 things about the Delhi Aerocity expansion project that will soon house India’s largest mall and the passenger connectivity options coming up at the IGI airport:","By 2027, Indira Gandhi International Airport's Aerocity will feature India's largest mall.

NEW DELHI: CEO of Tesla , Elon Musk , on Friday announced that the company plans to invest over $500 million this year to install new superchargers .

The finance minister set the stage for a ""Viksit Bharat by 2047"", on the core principles of ‘Sabka Saath’, ‘Sabka Vikas’, ‘Sabka Vishwas’, with ‘Sabka Prayas’ being added as a new theme in the interim Budget.This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data i.e., farmer welfare and N for Nari utthan i.e., support for women entrepreneurs.These form the pillars of a comprehensive inclusive development. The Government's commitment to sustainable development under the strategy for Amrit Kaal includes achieving 'Net Zero' by 2070, rooftop solarization for one crore households and robust health initiatives.The Indian economy's resilience takes center stage amidst positive indicators of declining current account deficit as a percentage of GDP, falling unemployment rates, and a notable rise in digital transactions. These statistics affirm the robustness of the economy, showcasing a trajectory of growth and stability.The achievements in taxation reforms are nothing short of remarkable, with direct tax collections more than trebling in the last decade, the number of tax return filers increasing by 2.4 times, average processing time of tax returns plummeting from 93 days in FY 2013-14 to an impressive 10 days in FY 2023-24, resulting in issuance of quick refunds. These are the results of consistent progressive measures thus obviating the need for, and rightly avoiding, any last-minute populist measures.No change in existing tax rates, both for direct and indirect taxes, is a good indicator of stability and predictability for investors and taxpayers.A welcome move to waive outstanding tax demands that are minor, disputed, and unreconciled. This involves the withdrawal of outstanding direct tax demands up to Rs. 25,000 pertaining to the period up to FY 2009-10 and up to Rs.10,000 for FY 2010-11 to 2014-15.The Government's commitment to fostering a business-friendly environment is evident in its intent to extend specific tax benefits for start-ups, investments by sovereign wealth funds/ pension funds, and certain IFSC units. The extension has been made now until March 31, 2025. This might help in creating a conducive landscape for business.To align with the CBDT notification issued earlier, the provisions relating to tax collection at source concerning remittances under the Liberalized Remittance Scheme have now been formally incorporated in the Finance Bill, 2024, setting the rate at 20% for amounts exceeding Rs. 7 lakhs in a financial year.The Finance Bill, 2024 proposes an extension of the time limit for introducing the faceless scheme by the Central Government for transfer pricing proceedings, DRP Proceedings, and ITAT Proceedings, up to March 31, 2025.The interim Budget 2024 may not have proposed significant tax announcements, but it very well positioned the prelude to the full budget post the upcoming elections. Considering the potential impact on the population across the four pillars of GYAN, a sizable portion of India stands to be covered. The interim Budget’s focus on the tax front resembles a report card, highlighting the maturity achieved by our tax system. The enhancement of taxpayer services was emphasized as a key priority.","This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data and N for Nari utthan.

Interim Budget for a Viksit Bharat: It’s for everyone and all,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/interim-budget-for-a-viksit-bharat-its-for-everyone-and-all/articleshow/107497439.cms,"By Akhilesh Tuteja

The Finance Minister on February 01, 2024, delivered a truly innovative interim budget. At first glance, it did not seem like an interim budget but looked more like the budget to drive further growth and a continuum of inclusive growth-oriented investments.At the outset, this budget brings a wonderful balance between fiscal prudence and continued investment for growth.It's not easy to continue the glide path of reducing the fiscal deficit and continuing to make significant investments in all areas including infrastructure, R&D, energy transition, technology, skilling, and social welfare. The surprising reduction in fiscal deficit of 5.8% as against the budgeted 5.9% for FY24 and the projection of 5.1% in FY25 with a clear focus on increasing investments was a huge positive.This was a budget for everyone and all because it caters to every part of the Indian economy and society. The FM has carefully catered to the investment needs of various sectors. The continued focus on youth, impoverished, women and farmers to increase their involvement and contribution to economic growth is evident. By committing an 11.1% increase in capital expenditure to 11,11,111 lakh crore, the FM has clearly brought every single 1 in this growth journey.What was very impressive was the inclusion strategy of the government. The focus on women's empowerment for the past few years is unprecedented, which is reflected in the inclusion of women in the workforce moving from 23.3% to 37% in the last five years. The thirty crore Mudra Yojna loans to women entrepreneurs were a great boost to the Nari Shakti initiative. We already have over 10 million Lakhpati Didis and what is truly evident is like a corporate CFO, the FM has revised the earlier target of 20 million Lakhpati Didis to 30 million. The government also plans to invest in initiatives to encourage young girls between the ages of 9 and 14 to undertake the vaccination for cervical cancer which is again a great boost to Nari Shakti.A lot needs to be done to bring more women into all parts of economic growth but the journey so far and the vision of the future is truly inspiring.While India continues on its technological prowess and makes its mark in new technologies like Artificial Intelligence, we need a multi-pronged strategy to harness the power of AI. We need a clear focus on building AI systems in India so that we not only emerge as a global leader in this new era but can build models, which are specific to India that will benefit Indians. At the same time, we need a very wide coverage program to build skills to leverage AI to its fullest potential. The biggest contribution we can make to the inclusion of youth in the economic development of the country is by skilling them in new skill areas. In the last few years, the Skill India Mission has trained 14 million youth, reskilled over 5 million youth and established a staggering 3,000 new ITIs. The future of any country will depend as much on capital investments as on skill investments.The focus on agricultural development and support to the farmer continues through direct financial assistance to farmers. The farmers have benefited by getting crop insurance through PM Fasal Bima Yojana. It's not just the farmers, the PM-SVANidhi provides credit assistance to a large number of street vendors.The last few years have seen the journey of affordable housing through Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY). There is a slight increase in allocation to launch a scheme for encouraging the middle class to build or buy new homes. This investment will likely propel a wider economic development and increase employment.India has seen a tremendous rise in entrepreneurship in the last few years. In order to continue the journey and promote new startups, the government proposes to extend certain tax benefits, which are expiring from March 2024 to March 2025. The MSMEs have not been left behind. With a proposal to provide timely finances to such enterprises, the government has paved the way for their growth, so they can look to compete globally.All in all, it’s a truly inclusive budget with a clear focus on development not just by giving away freebies but enabling the people to participate in the economic development activity. While the FM calls the comprehensive GDP - Governance, Development & Performance – to me, this budget is inclusive of another GDP – gender, demography, and professions.","Akhilesh Tuteja is Partner and Head, Clients and Markets, KPMG in India.

‘Enough domestic sources of demand to counter drag from external sector’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/enough-domestic-sources-of-demand-to-counter-drag-from-external-sector/articleshow/107372012.cms,"Do you think the

creates room for lower interest rates?

One of the issues that the Budget has flagged is the demographic challenge and opportunity and the societal change that is taking place. How do you view this?

Niti Aayog is working on the Viksit Bharat roadmap. What will be the focus areas?

You are as much a representative of the Centre as well as the states. Is it time to revisit the entire formula for transfers to states particularly on the issue of cesses and surcharges?

Suman Bery , who heads Niti Aayog , the govt think tank, is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China, which he says is also an opportunity for India. The economist is confident that Indian states remain resilient. Excerpts of the interview with TOI.The finance ministry expects the economy to grow 7% next year.Given the global situation, how do you see the prospects?The belief in the finance ministry is that we have a possible drag coming from the external sector but that we have other sources. We have enough domestic sources of demand. One has to applaud the political and economic judgment of FM in deciding that it was appropriate to pursue the path of fiscal consolidation. There is transparency. What this actually reflects is responsible economic management, which is one reason we are where we are. Second, it also creates a buffer so that there is policy space if we do encounter headwinds.That’s the hope and expectation. We have an independent central bank and an inflation targeting central bank, so it is up to the monetary policy committee to take a call through the monetary policy committee on the repo rate .The PM has said that when India grows its states grow. India is a composite of 37 states and UTs. They are each at very different points in their demographic transition. There are some states where the net replacement rate is down to 1%, like Kerala . There are others, particularly UP and Bihar, which are in their earliest stage of demographic transition and each one of these states is the size of a large European country. There are two implications of that — one is internal labour mobility and it will become an even larger part of our growth model. The govt has taken several steps to create a unified market. Our main endowment is our human capital and that has to be equipped to participate in global exchange in many ways. We know from China, Japan that the demographic dividend partly depends on markets and on human capital. But the golden period is fairly short lived, about 15 years, when the so called dependency ratio declines. The other big opportunity the PM has been highlighting is bringing women much more into the active labour force.When Niti was set up there was the idea of a three-year vision and a seven-year strategy paper. The reality is that schemes of govt tend to be aligned with the award of the Finance Commission . There are various established building blocks or hand holds which are already a matter of govt policy. The PM is much more interested in a national debate on what it means to be a Viksit Bharat or modern society. We have a collective goal and it is for the democratic polity to define what that goal should be. Its emphatically not for a super mandarin bureaucracy. It is not going to be Lee Kwan Yew’s Singapore led from the top.It’s entirely a finance ministry matter but I would be lying if I didn’t say when I visit certain states there is this complaint. A big frontier would be resource mobilisation at the state level. Second is going to be rationalisation of subsidies not only at the Union level, but also at the state level. All chief ministers sit on my governing council. When they convene as the governing council, I see them in their role as development practitioners. The world is beginning to appreciate quite how much institutional and political maturity India attained in our 75 years and the most fundamental dimension of a democracy, we have orderly transfers of power. There are enough buffers to ensure that what happens in state finances is unlikely to create macro instability. Those risks are well contained by our Constitution. The chief ministers know that they are going to be judged by development outcomes and so you can have the sugar rush of changing of pension plans or various handouts but if the cupboard is bare you are not going to be able to deliver.","Suman Bery is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China.

Government's Marathon to 2047: Emphasis on Fiscal Prudence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/governments-marathon-to-2047-emphasis-on-fiscal-prudence/articleshow/107371788.cms,"What was the thinking behind keeping the vote on account absolutely straight?

So is it the idea to keep the Budget completely transparent?

The capex has risen 11.1% and there is an emphasis on infrastructure spending. But there is also the hope that the private sector will now take over and start capital spending. Given the geopolitical situation, how confident is the govt that it will pan out as planned?

Finance secretary T V Somanathan, in an interview with TOI, says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047 . Excerpts:If you see the Budget speech you will see the emphasis on 2047. The govt has set its sight on running that marathon.Running to 2047 is a marathon , it’s not a sprint. If you are going to run a marathon, you need to be in good shape and you can’t have short-term stimulants or something that will get you some yards and then it’s done.The whole focus is on making India a developed country by 2047, for which a healthy present and a strong fiscal position is an important concomitant. Some purely short term measures don’t really fit into that picture. It’s a consistent picture: focus on the long term for which you need to build strength in the short term and that needs to be done by prudence in fiscal policy and by not doing things which can detract you from that path. Not doing the wrong thing is more important than appearing to do things.The idea is that govt finances may be good, bad or indifferent depending on the times, depending on the circumstances, depending on the policies. But what is the position should be reflected as reasonably and accurately as possible. That is an emphasis. As regards the Finance Commission, again the terms of reference that have been given to them are the terms in the Constitution.What is the means by which the devolution should be done is a matter they have full discretion. They can actually take all kinds of factors into account and in a sense we felt this time based on my review of the previous commissions that the right expression would be less is more. The shorter, less prescriptive terms of reference gives full scope for all stakeholders including state govts to express their viewpoints and for the commission to take a balanced view of the different perspectives and then come to its award. Ultimately the award of the Finance Commission is about devolution and grant for which full scope has now been given to them.n There are incipient signs of private capital expenditure accelerating. There are some surveys I have seen done by some of the chambers industry, which show high levels of investment. The PMI, which is a sort of leading indicator, is also looking pretty healthy. Capacity utilisation is one reason that private sector capital expenditure doesn’t immediately pick up when the economy starts accelerating because there is surplus capacity.But increasingly I get the sense that many industries are beginning to reach levels where they have to add capacity. When that happens capital investment will happen. Another pointer also mentioned in the Budget speech you may notice that our airlines have placed large orders for planes — that is capital expenditure.When you import 1,000 aircraft, it’s just not 1,000 aircraft, there are concomitant additions to ground handling facilities, you need airports to expand, you need to employ people to do that. That means a lot of jobs. The aircraft is capital but then look at the effect it is going to have on skilled jobs. So capital expenditure is happening. I am fairly confident that we will have decent capital expenditure in the year to come and that will become a new source of acceleration.",Finance secretary T V Somanathan says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047.

Income Tax Changes Budget 2024 : In the recent Budget 2024 speech, the Finance Minister kept the Section 80C tax deduction limit unchanged. The maximum limit for claiming tax benefits under Section 80C remains at Rs 1.5 lakh for the current fiscal year 2023-24 and will stay the same for individuals looking to save on taxes through Section 80C investments in the upcoming fiscal year 2024-25.Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions. Individuals can reduce their gross taxable income by up to Rs 1.5 lakh per financial year by engaging in these specific investments or expenditures.You can save on taxes through Section 80C by investing in things like Employees' Provident Fund (EPF), Public Provident Fund (PPF), Equity Linked Saving Scheme (ELSS) mutual funds, National Savings Certificate (NSC), and 5-year tax-saving fixed deposits with banks or post offices. Additionally, paying life insurance policy premiums also qualifies for tax benefits under Section 80C.It is important to note that each eligible investment comes with its specific maximum limit, rate of return, liquidity, and taxation rules for the earned returns, states ET in a report. For instance, the most you can invest in PPF in a financial year is Rs 1.5 lakh. Meanwhile, there's no limit on the amount you can invest in ELSS mutual funds, but the Section 80C deduction is capped at Rs 1.5 lakh.If individuals can't make specific investments, they can still get deductions under Section 80C from their gross taxable income through certain expenses. These expenses include repaying the principal amount of a home loan, tuition fees for children, payment of stamp duty, registration fees, and other costs related to buying a house.Since the financial year 2020-21, individuals without any business income must annually choose between the old and new tax regimes. As of the fiscal year 2023-24, the new tax regime is the default option. Consequently, individuals seeking tax deductions under Section 80C must opt for the old tax regime since this deduction isn't available in the new tax regime. It's crucial for taxpayers to be aware of these rules to make informed decisions about their tax planning and investment strategies.","Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget which is an interim budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year. The budget talks about inclusive development both, social and geographical, especially for youth, women, farmers, and the poor. Continued focus on improving logistics through infrastructure spend on roads, rail, airports, ports increases productivity for companies and citizens alike.To make ‘Viksit Bharat’ by 2047, the government’s focus is on improving and empowering people’s capabilities through various skilling initiatives. It is encouraging to see that Skill India Mission has succeeded in training more than 1.4 crore youth and upskilling and reskilling 54 lakh youth. I am particularly happy to see the continued focus on youth and women entrepreneurship and the announcement of a new fund which will give interest free 50 year loans for startups will provide a domestic fillip to startups supplementing venture capital we have traditionally relied on from abroad.PM Mudra Yojana has sanctioned 43 crore loans aggregating to 22.5 lakh crore to youth entrepreneurs and thirty crore Mudra Yojana loans to women entrepreneurs. There are several other schemes like Fund of Funds, Start-Up India, and Start-Up Credit Guarantee schemes that are assisting our youth. Further, the extension of tax benefits to Start-ups and investments made by sovereign wealth funds/pension funds, till 31st March 2025 depicts the government’s effort to support the startup eco- system.This aligns quite well with India Sanitation Coalition’s efforts to give impetus to the start-up world. Over the past 7 editions of our ISC-FICCI Sanitation Awards, we have recognized and promoted several start-ups in the sanitation space, many of whom are successful businesses now!While the finance minister did not provide detailed information on Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH), the budget allocation sees a slight increase in spend demonstrating continued focus on this highly successful program. The acknowledgement that the private sector has increasingly played a substantial role in addressing WASH issues in both urban and rural areas, with numerous projects underway through Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs), highlights the government's commitment to addressing challenges in this sector.A perfect example is the LightHouse Initiative initiated by the Department of Drinking Water along with the India Sanitation Coalition (ISC) by partnering with major corporates across India to develop model villages in Solid and Liquid Waste Management (SLWM) under SBM-Grameen. From this budget, there is an expectation that the government will persist in prioritizing Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) as the path toward achieving the country's Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6). Additionally, it is hoped that the government will uphold its commitment to making necessary infrastructural investments for SLWM.The budget speech rightly celebrates the fact that we have 83 lakh SHGs and 9 crore women beneficiaries. The microfinance movement in the country and the possibility of empowering women members of SHGs through livelihood skilling is a key to bringing women into mainstream economic advancement.The focus on green growth, rooftop solar, wind, biomass, e-vehicles all help with our green energy thrust. The tourism sector was mentioned and could be a huge job provider for youth and women.Guided by the principle ‘Reform, Perform, and Transform’, the budget emphasizes efficient implementation of various policies by improving coordination with states and relevant stakeholders. This is critical both for infra spend and social programsIt is noteworthy that ISC’s Climate Resilient Coastal Cities project which is being implemented in PPP (Public-Private Partnership) mode in four coastal states of Karnataka, Gujarat, Goa and Maharashtra is congruent with the government’s priority of promoting climate-resilient activities for the blue economy 2.0, a scheme for restoration and adaptation measures, and coastal aquaculture.The budget also focuses on the Aspirational districts program where assistance will be given to the states for faster development of aspirational districts and blocks, including the generation of ample economic opportunities. This is again very crucial as it has a huge potential to transform the landscape of our country while making sure no -one is left behind.Overall, this budget has embraced economic strategies and develops the building blocks that nurture and uphold growth, promote inclusive and sustainable development, and enhance productivity.","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year. Continued focus on improving logistics through infrastructure spend on roads, rail, airports, ports increases productivity for companies and citizens alike.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-107357973,imgsize-300646,width-400,resizemode-4/107357973.jpg"

Gold Prices: What’s the outlook?

Akshaya Tritiya Gold Price Outlook: Akshaya Tritiya is one of the biggest gold buying festivals in India. Gold has shown remarkable performance since the previous Akshaya Tritiya, which occurred on April 22, 2023, delivering a substantial 16% return. The cost of 10 grams of gold has increased by Rs 11,300, from Rs 59,845 to over Rs 71,100 currently.Although the price of 10 grams of gold is approximately Rs 3000 or 4% below its all-time highs, gold enthusiasts have the opportunity to purchase the precious metal on the auspicious occasion of Akshaya Tritiya, say experts.A study of gold price trends since 2014 reveals a varied performance of gold between one Akshaya Tritiya and the next. In 2015, the price decreased by 12% leading up to the following Akshaya Tritiya. Similarly, in 2017, there was a 3.23% decline.However, gold has yielded positive returns on eight occasions between two consecutive Akshaya Tritiya, with the highest returns of 32% in 2020. In 2023, the returns have once again reached double digits, making it an attractive time for investors to consider adding gold to their portfolios.Also Read | How is gold jewellery price calculated by jewellers? Check top points before buying gold on Akshaya Tritiya So where are gold prices headed and what should investors do? Here’s what experts have to sayNavneet Damani, Group Senior Vice President, Commodity and Currency Research, MOFS notes that just like last year, gold and silver has seen northward movement in Q1 2024 as well, matching or even outperforming other major asset classes. “As we enter the new FY, which starts with the auspicious occasion of Akshaya Tritiya, gold and silver have marked gains of 13% and 11% year-to-date, respectively. Two main factors are triggering volatility in the bullion market - geo-political tensions and US Federal Reserve monetary policy,” he tells TOI.Naveen Mathur, Director - Commodities & Currencies, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers says that gold prices are up almost 17–18 % since the last festival date. “Prices have continued to depict a strong trend in the first quarter of the year; a 3% increase in demand worldwide and an 8% increase in demand in India were noted as per estimates by the World Gold Council,” he tells TOI.According to Anand Rathi’s Mathur, gold prices have been rising due to the fact that investors have remained optimistic focusing on the long term value of their investments. “Although we may not expect new record highs in the near term, gold prices are still expected to remain steady this festival season. Jewellery demand may get impacted in rural India, while investment demand still remains firm leading to prices to consolidate in the range of Rs 69,800 – 72,900 in futures contract in MCX,” he said.Navneet Damani says comparing gold returns over the last 15 years for Akshaya Tritiya, gold has delivered a 10% CAGR. “There are both positives and negatives for gold prices at this juncture, lower than expected economic data points, rise in growth concerns, higher rate cut expectations in this year, geo-political tensions, concerns regarding rising debt, increase in demand and fall in US Yields could act as tailwinds for prices. Market participants always discount future events in advance, like an early rate cut by the US Fed, hence any black swan event could further support the prices in future,” he tells TOI.Also Read | What is 24 karat gold? Know difference between 999 vs 995 fineness gold “There are several platforms for market participants to invest in gold based on their risk profile. From a longer term horizon, it is advised to invest in Sovereign Gold Bonds which will help to capitalise the price rise in gold and an additional 2.5% p.a. interest to investors. Several other modes to invest could be in the form of ETF, exchange traded derivatives, Digital Gold and Physical bars and coins,” Damani said.“We continue to maintain a positive stance for Gold recommending buying on dips, with a target of Rs 75,000 for gold on domestic front and $2450 on Comex,” he adds.Anuj Gupta, Head Commodity & Currency at HDFC Securities told ET, “The recent correction is a good opportunity for investors who have a medium to long term term view on this bullion metal and one should look to invest in it in a staggered manner rather than in one shot”. He suggests Rs 69,000-Rs 69,500 levels as favourable entry points as sees room for further upside with prices expected to hit Rs 80,000-Rs 85,000 by next Akshaya Tritiya.","Gold has shown remarkable performance since the previous Akshaya Tritiya, which occurred on April 22, 2023, delivering a substantial 16% return.

His pioneering use of computer signals for trading decisions earned him the nickname "" Quant King .""With a net worth estimated at $31 billion by Forbes, Simons also became a prominent philanthropist, giving away billions of dollars during his lifetime to support medical and science research, teaching and Democratic candidates.""Churchill said 'great and good are seldom the same man.'

Lukenas, who was involved in a $2 billion merger just days before his passing, reportedly worked approximately 100 hours per week leading up to the completion of the deal.His death from ""acute coronary artery thrombus"" at the age of 35 has sparked intense debate and anger among his peers and the wider community.The reaction on Wall Street has been swift and severe, with many pointing fingers at the demanding work culture prevalent in many financial institutions, including Bank of America. Discussions among employees about a potential walkout have been reported, as staff consider drastic measures to call for better working conditions. This potential action is underscored by a growing sentiment that the health and well-being of employees are being sacrificed for profit, a New York Post report said.Social media platforms and financial forums like Wall Street Oasis have become battlegrounds for discussions about the industry's work ethics. A post outlining demands for improved employee welfare, including capping work hours and guaranteeing weekends off, has gained significant traction with over 450 comments supporting the call for change.Despite the outcry, Bank of America has not announced any plans to investigate the circumstances leading to Lukenas’s death or to review its work policies. A spokesperson from the bank expressed condolences but noted that there would be no action taken against Gary Howe, Lukenas’s supervisor, nor any inquiries into the allegations of forced long work hours.As Wall Street faces renewed scrutiny over its work practices, the situation at Bank of America may serve as a pivotal moment for reform in the industry, echoing past instances where tragedies led to changes in workplace policies across financial institutions.","Leo Lukenas III, a Bank of America associate and former Green Beret, died from ""acute coronary artery thrombus"" at the age of 35.

Conducted from the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, where he is serving a 25-year sentence , Bankman-Fried revealed to Puck News' William D Cohan that he lives in a large, dormitory-style room with 35 other inmates, surviving mainly on beans and rice from the commissary.This staple diet has turned rice into an unexpected form of currency within the prison walls, with inmates using it to barter for other goods.During the interview, which had to be conducted without the aid of recording devices or notes due to prison regulations, Bankman-Fried discussed his adaptation to prison life. He described a routine that includes less engagement with the available television sets and more time spent on a tablet playing games or watching movies. Notably thinner, having lost approximately 25 pounds, he commented on the vegan meals provided, which he and other inmates find inedible, even comparing their smell to ""shit."" Despite the harsh conditions, he said he has not experienced abuse and does not fear for his personal safety, though he did mention being pestered by other inmates for his rice at night, an Insider report said.Bankman-Fried also reiterated his stance on the legal proceedings, insisting on his innocence and expressing his intentions to appeal his conviction on several counts including wire fraud, money laundering, and conspiracy. These charges stem from allegations that he misappropriated billions of dollars of FTX customer funds—a scandal that US Attorney Damian Williams labeled as one of the largest financial frauds in American history. As Bankman-Fried navigates these challenges, he remains a central figure in ongoing discussions about the regulation and risks associated with cryptocurrency markets.","Sam Bankman-Fried has opened up about his daily life and legal battles in his first detailed interview since his imprisonment.

Dogeverse ($DOGEVERSE) is one of the hottest cryptocurrencies of May 2024.The multichain meme coin has become a sensation in a brief time. In less than a month of the presale launch, Dogeverse has secured more than $13M. The presale gained strength after its Solana integration .The final stage of the presale is now live. Dogeverse is hosting one of the most successful presales of 2024 now.Due to the escalating demand for the token, the presale is expected to sell out ahead of schedule.Investors and traders are pouring millions into the presale. In fact, the soft cap allocation of 200 billion tokens was sold out instantly. Within days of its launch, the multichain meme coin was viral. It showed resilience even during the broader market downturns of April.The large growth potential of the project is further made evident by the Dogeverse Twitter community that was launched just last month. It has now grown to 13.9K members.What’s behind the growing interest in the project?Much of Dogeverse’s viral growth has to do with its multichain foundation. The largely unexplored feature sets the project apart from dog coins.Dogeverse is launching on six top blockchains – Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, Solana, Avalanche, and Base.Once the presale ends, investors will have to acquire the token from popular crypto exchanges. But if the presale FOMO is any indication, a turbocharged debut launch is awaiting the token. Waiting until the exchange launches might prove expensive for investors.Both degens and whales are securing $DOGEVERSE tokens in large numbers now to avoid the hefty price tag later.The meme coin market is teeming with hundreds of different projects.But they are often knockoffs of popular ones like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, or Pepe. While this quick strategy helps them gain immediate attention, it doesn’t serve projects aiming for long-term relevance.That explains why most meme coins are short-living. The lack of focus on building a robust meme coin foundation renders them fleeting.Establishing relevance is crucial for long-term sustainability in a crowded space.This understanding is at the core of Dogeverse.It stands out due to its deep-rooted multichain infrastructure that is building an interconnected universe for doge enthusiasts. It blends community, rewards, and creativity.Dogeverse is a logical investment from a speculative standpoint as well.Given that four of the top five meme coins are dog-themed, there is growing hype around Dogeverse Celebrities like Elon Musk, entrepreneur Mark Cuban, and musicians Gene Simmons and Snoop Dogg are fans of dog coins, which adds to the buzz.Cosmo the Doge is journeying across Dogeverse.Cosmo’s goal is to help meme coin investors tap into the unique advantages of different blockchains. For example, the project's availability on the world's top six blockchains offers high flexibility, as users can access the token on any of these networks.Cosmo's ability to ""hyperjump"" between blockchains facilitates seamless transactions with minimal fees, enabling investors to optimise returns.Dogeverse also unlocks hot crypto trends like Solana meme coins with its multichain infrastructure. Solana's robust digital economy with a massive total value locked (TVL) and a large user base is behind the craze.Trending meme coins such as Dogwifhat, Bonk, MEW, and Slerf climbed the charts in 2024, capitalising on their Solana label.The presence on six hot networks aligns Dogeverse with more blockchain-based meme coin trends.The Dogeverse presale has raised $13M+ so far. The final presale stage is now underway, offering investors the last chance to buy the token for a fixed discounted price of $0.00031 per unit.Staking rewards with up to 71% APY accompany presale investments.Market forces will dictate the token price after the presale. Dogeverse has introduced staking on Ethereum to encourage early backers. The promise of passive income helps reduce early sell-offs and supports the token's long-term price stability.The growing hype surrounding the chain-hopping Cosmo indicates that Dogeverse is moving toward a turbocharged launch. The technical prowess and strong community backing, on the other hand, strengthen its sustainability.The multichain token’s growing popularity shows that it has the potential to make the list of top meme coins this year.","Dogeverse ($DOGEVERSE) is one of the hottest cryptocurrencies of May 2024.

Chinese tech executive fired after endorsing toxic work culture on social media,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/chinese-tech-executive-fired-after-endorsing-toxic-work-culture-on-social-media/articleshow/110002210.cms,"NEW DELHI: Qu Jing , the former vice president and head of communications at Baidu, China's counterpart to Google, has been ousted following a backlash over her public endorsement of a rigorous workplace culture. Her remarks, which sparked widespread outrage among young workers in China, highlighted deep-seated issues within the tech industry regarding work-life balance and employee treatment .As per a CNN report, Qu Jing came under fire after a series of videos posted on Douyin, China's version of TikTok, revealed her stringent management style and lack of empathy towards employees' personal circumstances. In one notable video, Qu rebuked an employee for not wanting to undertake a 50-day business trip during strict Covid-19 travel restrictions, stating, ""Why should I take my employee’s family into consideration? I’m not her mother-in-law.""Her blunt comments about her personal sacrifices, such as forgetting her elder son's birthday due to work commitments, and demanding employees to be available 24/7, intensified the public outcry. ""If you work in public relations, don’t expect weekends off,"" she asserted in another video, emphasizing the relentless demands placed on her team.The backlash was swift and fierce, with netizens and media pundits criticizing Qu for promoting an unhealthy work environment synonymous with the controversial ""996"" working hour system—9 am to 9 pm, six days a week—previously endorsed by figures like Alibaba’s Jack Ma. Ivy Yang, a tech analyst, observed, ""A lot of what she said really struck a nerve, because people feel that in their own workplaces very often. The fact that she said it in a way that’s so direct and in your face, it just generated this kind of emotional response.""Following the controversy, Qu was compelled to remove her executive title from her Douyin account and issued an apology on WeChat, acknowledging the insensitivity of her remarks: “I have carefully read all the opinions and comments from various platforms, and many criticisms are very pertinent. I deeply reflect on and humbly accept them.”The incident has reignited discussions about work culture in China's tech industry, which has been notorious for its demanding expectations and the glorification of overwork. This sector has faced increasing scrutiny as employees push back against the long-standing norms of excessive work hours and the lack of work-life balance.Baidu has not made an official statement regarding Qu's departure, and efforts to get comments from the company remained unanswered as of Thursday night. Qu’s videos have since been removed from Douyin, reflecting the severity of the backlash and the ongoing debate over corporate culture in one of the world's most dynamic technological hubs.","Qu Jing, the former vice president and head of communications at Baidu, China's counterpart to Google, has been ousted following a backlash over her public endorsement of a rigorous workplace culture.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.8% to 39,387.76, and the Nasdaq composite added 0.3%, to 16,346.26.A report showing a pickup in layoffs helped to support the market . The number of workers applying for unemployment benefits rose by more last week than economists expected, though it remains relatively low compared with history.That could be a sign the economy can pull off a hoped-for balancing act of staying solid enough to avoid a bad recession, but not so strong that it puts upward pressure on inflation.Equinix jumped 11.5% after reporting stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. The company, which runs data centers around the world, also said an independent investigation led by its board found no accounting inconsistencies or errors that would require financial restatements. Earlier, an investment firm had accused it of ""major accounting manipulation.""Yeti Holdings rose 12.8% after reporting better profit for the latest quarter than expected thanks to stronger sales for its drinkware and coolers and equipment.Cheesecake Factory gained 6.2% after topping expectations for profit. The results were encouraging following some recent warnings by big food and drink companies about how much pressure their customers, particularly lower-income ones, are feeling.Airbnb sank 6.9% despite topping expectations for profit and revenue. It gave a forecasted range for revenue in the current quarter whose midpoint fell short of what analysts expected. It said an earlier Easter pulled more of its business this year into the first quarter from the second quarter.In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury eased to 4.45% from 4.50% late Wednesday. The two-year yield, which more closely tracks expectations for the Fed, slipped to 4.81% from 4.84% late Wednesday.A smooth auction of 30-year Treasury bonds helped to keep yields stable.Treasury yields have largely been easing since Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said last week that the central bank remains closer to cutting its main interest rate than hiking it, despite a string of stubbornly high readings on inflation this year. A cooler-than-expected jobs report on Friday, meanwhile, suggested the U.S. economy could manage to avoid being either too hot or too cold.In energy trading, benchmark U.S. crude rose 56 cents to $79.82 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

Setback for Musk's Neuralink: First human brain implant encounters technical glitch,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/setback-for-musks-neuralink-first-human-brain-implant-encounters-technical-glitch/articleshow/109995041.cms,"NEW DELHI: Elon Musk 's ambitious startup Neuralink has encountered a significant hiccup in its first human brain implant trial. The device, designed to help paralyzed individuals control technology through thought, began detaching from the skull of the test subject, 29-year-old Noland Arbaugh, reducing its data capture capability. This issue arose just weeks after the company showcased the device's functionalities in a live demonstration.Arbaugh, paralyzed from the shoulders down due to a diving accident eight years ago, was the first to undergo the implantation of Neuralink's brain-computer interface ( BCI ) in January.The interface includes 1,024 electrodes across 64 threads thinner than a human hair, intended to monitor neural activity and translate it into computer commands. However, complications arose as several threads retracted from Arbaugh's brain, leading to a decrease in the number of effective electrodes.""In response to this change, we modified the recording algorithm to be more sensitive to neural population signals, improved the techniques to translate these signals into cursor movements, and enhanced the user interface,"" Neuralink said, aiming to overcome the setback. The company noted that these refinements led to a ""rapid and sustained improvement"" in Arbaugh's performance, measured in bits per second (BPS), a standard metric for speed and accuracy in this technology.The incident has sparked concerns about the long-term viability and safety of such implants, though Neuralink confirmed that the malfunction has not posed a direct risk to Arbaugh's safety. Despite the possibility of removing the implant, the decision was made to keep it in place as adjustments appeared to rectify the issue effectively.This event marks a crucial phase in Neuralink’s journey, which began in 2016 and gained human trial approval from the US Food and Drug Administration last year after extensive animal testing. Arbaugh remains optimistic about the technology's impact, saying during a March livestream, ""Now I can literally just lie in bed and play to my heart’s content,"" until the battery of his rechargeable chip expires.Neuralink's efforts in pioneering brain-computer interface technology continue to draw global attention, balancing groundbreaking potential with the challenges of practical implementation.","Elon Musk's startup Neuralink has encountered a significant hiccup in its first human brain implant trial.

Tim Cook can't run Apple forever. Who's next?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/tim-cook-cant-run-apple-forever-whos-next/articleshow/109990265.cms,"Tim Cook has transformed Apple since taking over as CEO from Steve Jobs in 2011, introducing new product categories (the smartwatch), pushing into new businesses (streaming video), and making an audacious attempt to take a new type of computing (mixed reality) mainstream. He's served for far longer than the average Fortune 500 CEO, and, at 63, is older than many of his peers.But if it seems like a logical time for Cook to start planning for someone else to shape Apple's next chapter, the situation is complicated by the lack of someone who's both ready immediately and likely to be a long-term successor.Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst at Sanford C Bernstein who's covered Apple for two decades, says succession has become a topic among investors. ""You look down the list of executives, and it's really not clear how this all pans out,"" he says. ""You wonder why there hasn't been more transparency and exposure for the next leaders. It raises a broader question: Does Apple have a comprehensive and deliberate set of succession plans?""Several people familiar with Apple's inner workings recently discussed the issue with Bloomberg Businessweek, requesting anonymity to speak about the sensitive subject. If Cook were to step down soon, these people say, he would almost assuredly be replaced by COO Jeff Williams , who emerged as the top candidate to be Cook's successor a few years ago. In 2015, Cook named Williams Apple's first COO since Cook himself held that role under Jobs. That same year, Williams shepherded the first major new product in the Cook era, the Apple Watch, to market. And, four years later, he replaced Ive as the head of hardware and software design. But Williams, who's 61 this year, is only two years Cook's junior, and company insiders say they think it's now unlikely he'll be the new long-term chief.People within Apple say the most likely successor would be John Ternus , the hardware engineering chief. In a company whose success has always come from building category-defining gadgets, the ascension of a hardware engineering expert to the CEO job would seem logical. Ternus, who's not yet 50, would also be more likely than other members of the executive team to stick around for a long time, potentially providing another decade or more of Cook-esque stability.""He has a lot of managerial characteristics like Tim."" Christopher Stringer, a former top Apple hardware designer, called Ternus a ""trustworthy hand"" who's ""never failed with any role he's been elevated to."" Eddy Cue, the Apple executive known as Cook's closest confidant, has privately told colleagues that Ternus should be the next CEO, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.Other names that come up include Craig Federighi, head of software engineering, a recognizable face among Apple's biggest fans who's known internally to be conversant on corporate issues well outside of his purview, and Deirdre O'Brien, its head of retail and a Cook confidant, according to one former executive. People close to the company consider them unlikely successors.","Tim Cook has transformed Apple since taking over as CEO from Steve Jobs in 2011.
