"Asked to quit, Paytm employees cry foul",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/asked-to-quit-paytm-employees-cry-foul/articleshow/110979880.cms,"MUMBAI: ""I started crying at the meeting. I told them that I was willing to work even at a lower salary and designation,"" said a Paytm employee who is staring at an imminent job cut . Executives from the HR department reached out to him over a call late last month, stating that his role would be eliminated as part of an organisational restructuring and asking him to tender his resignation by early June.Facing an uncertain future in the wake of RBI's decision to put an end to Paytm Payments Bank and the wallet business, scores of employees are being asked to ""voluntarily resign"" without being given any prior notice, several have been denied severance pay and many are being asked to pay back their joining and retention bonuses to the company, several former and present employees of Paytm told TOI.The fintech has not furnished any formal communication outlining the restructuring process and the resultant job losses to any of the impacted employees and has warned them against recording any of the HR meetings. ""The calls with HRs are being labelled as 'connect' or 'discussion'. There is no formal documentation of any kind,"" an employee alleged.A review of a few of Paytm's offer letters showed that the amount of joining and retention bonuses will be ""recoverable"" by the company if they ""leave the employment"" before 18 months of taking up the role. In some cases, the same clause applies in cases of termination ""for any cause"" as well.For those whose offers letters do not include the termination clause, Paytm's justification is that it is mentioned in their appointment letters which were provided after joining. Employees said that many of them did not receive any appointment letters either via mails or postal deliveries and those who did were never asked to sign the papers and acknowledge.Some of the employees TOI spoke with alleged that their offer letters do not mention pay back of bonuses in case of termination.Paytm has refuted the allegations. ""We strongly deny allegations pertaining to any forced action on employees or unfair treatment. We have rigorously ensured that our HR teams have informed employees about their termination through official channels only. Further, we would also emphasise that all transitions are duly undertaken as per norms laid out in the appointment letter of these employees. To help them adjust and plan their next move, we are honouring full notice periods of these employees while also extending additional support such as outplacement, and processing of due bonuses at the time of their full and final settlements. Our focus remains on building a leaner organisation that is well-positioned to deliver long-term sustainable growth and value to our stakeholders. We remain committed to supporting our employees during this transition,"" a company spokesperson said in response to queries from TOI.A former employee whose services were recently terminated by the company because he refused to resign said Paytm did not furnish an experience letter.While several employees voluntarily resigned over the past few months, fearing the repercussions of being served with a termination notice, a section of employees are waging a silent battle - they have refused to resign, raised concerns with Paytm's internal employee escalation team and are seeking a ""fair exit process"".The impacted employees have also formed a social media group to deliberate and decide on the next course of action. Some of them are consulting lawyers with at least one employee having already filed a complaint with the labour ministry.If an employee raises a complaint with Paytm's employee escalation team, the company is supposed to investigate the matter and present a report to the employee. An affected employee with the lending team is still awaiting a report to the complaint raised.""Just two months ago, (founder) Vijay Shekhar Sharma in a townhall had said that no one from the lending team will be laid off. I thought my job was safe,"" the person said.Some employees said that layoffs have been happening since Oct ""I was abruptly laid off on Jan 5. My finances were strained and I had to take a loan to pay back my bonus of Rs 2 lakh,"" alleged former staffer Prakher Srivastava.","Employees say they have been asked to ""voluntarily resign"" without being given any prior notice. Many have been denied severance pay and many are being asked to pay back their joining and retention bonuses to the company, several former and present employees of Paytm told TOI.

"Adani buys Penna Cement from Reddys in Rs 10,000 crore deal",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/adani-buys-penna-cement-from-reddys-in-rs-10000-crore-deal/articleshow/110979861.cms,"MUMBAI: The Gautam Adani family owned Ambuja Cements is buying Penna Cement Industries in a deal valued at Rs 10,442 crore including debt, expanding its presence in the south. The transaction marks Ambuja's fourth M&A after Adani checked into the sector through the former in Sept 2022.Hyderabad-based Penna, promoted by P Prathap Reddy and family, has an annual production capacity of 14 million tons (of which 4 million tons is under construction). It also has limestone reserves and captive power plants.The Penna acquisition, to be financed by internal accruals, will improve Ambuja's share by 8% in south India and comes months after market leader UltraTech Cement ramped up its play in the region by buying Kesoram Industries' building materials units. As of April end, Ambuja had cash of Rs 24,338 crore on its books, having received warrant money of Rs 8,339 crore from the Adani family.The Penna transaction will help Ambuja and its arms, including ACC and Sanghi Industries, beef up capacity to 89 million tons, moving towards its larger goal of 140 million tons by 2028. UltraTech, owned by Kumar Mangalam Birla, has a capacity of over 150 million tons. In April, India's third-largest player Shree Cement, led by Hari Mohan Bangur, inaugurated a 3-million-ton plant in Andhra Pradesh to bolster its capacity to 56 million tons.Ambuja previously acquired Gujarat-based Sanghi, My Home's cement unit in Tamil Nadu and Asian Concretes and Cements' plants in Himachal Pradesh and Punjab.Prathap Reddy had earlier looked at an IPO for his cement business but subsequently changed plans. In Oct 2021, Penna received markets regulator Sebi's nod for a Rs 1,550-crore IPO but did not proceed with it. ""Initially we thought (of an IPO) but it got delayed. I have decided to do (away) with (the cement business),"" Reddy told TOI.The businessman, known as 'Penna' Reddy in Hyderabad circles, was considered a confidant of former Andhra Pradesh CM YS Jagan Mohan Reddy's father YS Rajasekhara Reddy, the unified Andhra Pradesh CM who died in a chopper crash in Sept 2009. Reddy was made an accused in the Penna chargesheet in the Jagan disproportionate assets case that is being probed by CBI and ED. Jagan's YSR Congress Party lost the recent Andhra assembly polls to Nara Chandrababu Naidu-led Telugu Desam Party.Incorporated in Oct 1991, Penna had a turnover of Rs 1,241 crore in FY24. In FY22, its turnover was Rs 3,204 crore. In May 2019, Penna had acquired Sri Lanka-based Singha Cement that operates a 0.5 mtpa cement packing terminal in Colombo.Penna's seven plants in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Rajasthan (under construction) and limestone reserves ""provide an opportunity to increase cement capacity through debottlenecking and additional investment"", said Ambuja Cements CEO Ajay Kapur . ""Importantly, the bulk cement terminals will prove to be a game-changer by giving access to the eastern and southern parts of peninsular India, apart from an entry to Sri Lanka, through the sea route,"" Kapur added.","Ambuja Cements is buying Penna Cement Industries in a deal valued at Rs 10,442 crore including debt.

Bangladesh is not alone in facing problems with Chinese military hardware. Other countries, such as Myanmar, have also faced issues with Chinese fighter jets, according to an ET report.Experts on the Chinese defense industry argue that Beijing lacks the necessary expertise to produce highly sophisticated military hardware and is not yet considered a top-class manufacturer of modern defense equipment. They allege that most of the weapons sold by China are based on outdated technology that it had copied from the West.Developing countries frequently purchase Chinese weapons due to their lower cost compared to similar systems from the West. China sells arms through state-run export organizations like the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC), NORINCO, and CVIC.Sources familiar with the matter told ET, the Bangladesh military has recently accused Chinese companies of providing faulty spare parts for its corvettes, petrol crafts, and onshore patrol vehicles. These vessels were found to have manufacturing defects and technical problems.Also Read | India’s Defence Preparedness: From Agni-V MIRV missile test to 5th generation fighter aircraft, Su-30MKI upgrade & Tejas - top developments In a separate incident, the Bangladesh Air Force reported technical issues with Chinese-made F-7 fighter jets and short-range air defense systems. The air force also encountered problems with firing ammunition for its Chinese-made K-8W aircraft shortly after delivery.Sources indicated that Chinese-supplied airborne interception radars and radars on Bangladesh's fighter aircraft have failed to meet accuracy standards.The Bangladesh Army had purchased Main Battle Tanks (MBT 2000) from China's North Industries Corporation (NORINCO). However, NORINCO is reportedly facing difficulties in supplying parts to Bangladesh for the repair and maintenance of these tanks.The Bangladesh Navy has also faced challenges with two Chinese-made frigates (BNS Umar Farooq and BNS Abu Ubaidah) experiencing multiple defects soon after arriving at Mongla port in Bangladesh. The Chinese companies demanded additional payments to repair these boats.Also Read | Modi 3.0 must bite the bullet to make military future-ready A decade ago, China sold two refurbished Ming-class submarines to Bangladesh for just over $100 million each, but Dhaka later discovered that the submarines were obsolete.In September of last year, the Bangladesh Navy informed China Vanguard Industry Co. Ltd. (CVIC) of issues with the C704 system installed on warship 'BNS Nirmul', but the company only agreed to upgrade the system at an additional cost.Bangladesh had also purchased 45 Multi Launch Rocket System (MLRS) units from China but is now planning to replace 36 of them with Turkish-made MLRS.","Bangladesh has lodged complaints with Beijing regarding the supply of defective components and technical issues with its imported military hardware.

Snowflake’s taking AI to where data resides: CEO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/snowflakes-taking-ai-to-where-data-resides-ceo/articleshow/110955730.cms,"It has been about four years since Snowflake entered the Indian market. How has the journey been so far?

How has the rise of GenAI impacted cloud-based data storage and analytics service businesses?

You have just announced Snowflake Cortex Analyst and Cortex Search…

Where else do you see Gen AI having an impact?

You say that Snowflake LLM Arctic with its mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture allows AI models to be built faster and at a fraction of the cost of traditional methods. How does it do this?

How do you see the adoption of Gen AI-based products in enterprises?

SAN FRANCISCO: “We receive five billion queries on our Data Cloud every day,” says Sridhar Ramaswamy, CEO of Snowflake, the cloud-based data platform that provides data storage, processing, and analytics solutions. The number is significant, considering Google receives an average of 8.5 billion search requests every day. Ramaswamy was speaking at the firm’s ‘Snowflake Summit 2024’ in San Francisco earlier this week, where the company announced a slew of new technologies that “take AI to where data resides”. The company also announced a tie up with Nvidia that will allow Snowflake customers and partners to build AI-powered applications. Ramaswamy, an IIT Madras alumnus who was in Google for over 15 years and who was appointed CEO of Snowflake in Feb, spoke to TOI on the sidelines of the summit. Excerpts:Snowflake operates in two buckets in India. One is with India-based customers like Swiggy, Urban Company, and Piramal Capital, so they can unlock the full value of their data. The second pertains to the trend of American companies moving their core infrastructure to India. We are investing heavily in having a presence in India, in training more people on Snowflake. Companies like Morgan Stanley, for example, have their very senior staff in India taking care of data operations using Snowflake. We have close to 500 people in our Pune centre of excellence, and a lot more expansion is to come.Generative AI is going to have an impact from bottom to top in the stack. For example, there’s a Snowflake feature that transcribes videos, and after indexing the text, you can create a chatbot based on it. And the thing that people are most excited about is that instead of getting a bunch of links, you get answers. We also help them get grounded, cited answers, so that they know where the answers are coming from. Our value prop at Snowflake is to create a single unified product, where things like AI are tightly integrated, and we see ourselves as more an AI Data Cloud.Cortex Analyst is a bit of a North Star for the business analytics area — it will let a business user talk to their data and get answers back. If a business user asks an unreasonable question, the product will say ‘no’. As soon as you give people a chatbot, they start asking ridiculous things like ‘what is my revenue going to be 15 years from now’. A piece of SQL is certainly not going to give you that information. I generally see AI as an enhancer for data access and visualisation. Cortex Analyst is all about asking natural language questions of structured data. Cortex Search is about getting documents indexed so that you can create a chatbot very easily.In cleaning data, for instance. Data has always been messy. There’s no magic wand making sure that you have clean data. For example, think about all the documents that you have consumed. Whenever you search, for example, you are going to run into outdated documents. Making sure that these are marked as outdated or updated will be an ongoing event. We see language models helping with several of these problems. Companies currently spend millions of dollars every year just on data engineering – for cleaning up data, and getting it into a good place.Just like standard AI models, MoE is a stack of parameters, one on top of each other. There are often 24 to 32 layers of neurons that are different kinds of behaviour and connections. In dense models like GPT-3, when a new token (unit of input like a word, an image, etc) comes in for training, it ends up affecting every parameter (GPT-3 has approximately 175 billion parameters) at every layer. For instance, you take a sentence, mask a word in it, and ask the model to predict the word by feeding this sentence in. In the process, every token ends up affecting all parameters and this just makes it computationally expensive to update the model to train on a large amount of data. With MoE, you do an arbitrary subdivision of the token space and, during training, you will have portions of the neural network that get activated for different buckets of tokens (instead of having to impact all the parameters). So, you end up constructing models that are a combination of dense networks that are activated for every token, and sparse experts that are activated only partially. Now, this process can end up producing models that are almost as good as the dense models, but for a smaller amount of compute. And, you can train models faster and more efficiently.Canva, Zoom and Bayer and many others are harnessing Cortex AI to create applications and drive productivity. We have several hundred others building applications to talk to their enterprise data with natural language for business-critical decision making.","Sridhar Ramaswamy is CEO of Snowflake, a cloud-based data platform that provides data storage, processing, and analytics solutions.

The finance minister set the stage for a ""Viksit Bharat by 2047"", on the core principles of ‘Sabka Saath’, ‘Sabka Vikas’, ‘Sabka Vishwas’, with ‘Sabka Prayas’ being added as a new theme in the interim Budget.This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data i.e., farmer welfare and N for Nari utthan i.e., support for women entrepreneurs. These form the pillars of a comprehensive inclusive development. The Government's commitment to sustainable development under the strategy for Amrit Kaal includes achieving 'Net Zero' by 2070, rooftop solarization for one crore households and robust health initiatives.The Indian economy's resilience takes center stage amidst positive indicators of declining current account deficit as a percentage of GDP, falling unemployment rates, and a notable rise in digital transactions. These statistics affirm the robustness of the economy, showcasing a trajectory of growth and stability.The achievements in taxation reforms are nothing short of remarkable, with direct tax collections more than trebling in the last decade, the number of tax return filers increasing by 2.4 times, average processing time of tax returns plummeting from 93 days in FY 2013-14 to an impressive 10 days in FY 2023-24, resulting in issuance of quick refunds. These are the results of consistent progressive measures thus obviating the need for, and rightly avoiding, any last-minute populist measures.No change in existing tax rates, both for direct and indirect taxes, is a good indicator of stability and predictability for investors and taxpayers.A welcome move to waive outstanding tax demands that are minor, disputed, and unreconciled. This involves the withdrawal of outstanding direct tax demands up to Rs. 25,000 pertaining to the period up to FY 2009-10 and up to Rs.10,000 for FY 2010-11 to 2014-15.The Government's commitment to fostering a business-friendly environment is evident in its intent to extend specific tax benefits for start-ups, investments by sovereign wealth funds/ pension funds, and certain IFSC units. The extension has been made now until March 31, 2025. This might help in creating a conducive landscape for business.To align with the CBDT notification issued earlier, the provisions relating to tax collection at source concerning remittances under the Liberalized Remittance Scheme have now been formally incorporated in the Finance Bill, 2024, setting the rate at 20% for amounts exceeding Rs. 7 lakhs in a financial year.The Finance Bill, 2024 proposes an extension of the time limit for introducing the faceless scheme by the Central Government for transfer pricing proceedings, DRP Proceedings, and ITAT Proceedings, up to March 31, 2025.The interim Budget 2024 may not have proposed significant tax announcements, but it very well positioned the prelude to the full budget post the upcoming elections. Considering the potential impact on the population across the four pillars of GYAN, a sizable portion of India stands to be covered. The interim Budget’s focus on the tax front resembles a report card, highlighting the maturity achieved by our tax system. The enhancement of taxpayer services was emphasized as a key priority.","This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data and N for Nari utthan.

Interim Budget for a Viksit Bharat: It’s for everyone and all,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/interim-budget-for-a-viksit-bharat-its-for-everyone-and-all/articleshow/107497439.cms,"By Akhilesh Tuteja

The Finance Minister on February 01, 2024, delivered a truly innovative interim budget. At first glance, it did not seem like an interim budget but looked more like the budget to drive further growth and a continuum of inclusive growth-oriented investments.At the outset, this budget brings a wonderful balance between fiscal prudence and continued investment for growth. It's not easy to continue the glide path of reducing the fiscal deficit and continuing to make significant investments in all areas including infrastructure, R&D, energy transition, technology, skilling, and social welfare. The surprising reduction in fiscal deficit of 5.8% as against the budgeted 5.9% for FY24 and the projection of 5.1% in FY25 with a clear focus on increasing investments was a huge positive.This was a budget for everyone and all because it caters to every part of the Indian economy and society. The FM has carefully catered to the investment needs of various sectors. The continued focus on youth, impoverished, women and farmers to increase their involvement and contribution to economic growth is evident. By committing an 11.1% increase in capital expenditure to 11,11,111 lakh crore, the FM has clearly brought every single 1 in this growth journey.What was very impressive was the inclusion strategy of the government. The focus on women's empowerment for the past few years is unprecedented, which is reflected in the inclusion of women in the workforce moving from 23.3% to 37% in the last five years. The thirty crore Mudra Yojna loans to women entrepreneurs were a great boost to the Nari Shakti initiative. We already have over 10 million Lakhpati Didis and what is truly evident is like a corporate CFO, the FM has revised the earlier target of 20 million Lakhpati Didis to 30 million. The government also plans to invest in initiatives to encourage young girls between the ages of 9 and 14 to undertake the vaccination for cervical cancer which is again a great boost to Nari Shakti.A lot needs to be done to bring more women into all parts of economic growth but the journey so far and the vision of the future is truly inspiring.While India continues on its technological prowess and makes its mark in new technologies like Artificial Intelligence, we need a multi-pronged strategy to harness the power of AI. We need a clear focus on building AI systems in India so that we not only emerge as a global leader in this new era but can build models, which are specific to India that will benefit Indians. At the same time, we need a very wide coverage program to build skills to leverage AI to its fullest potential. The biggest contribution we can make to the inclusion of youth in the economic development of the country is by skilling them in new skill areas. In the last few years, the Skill India Mission has trained 14 million youth, reskilled over 5 million youth and established a staggering 3,000 new ITIs. The future of any country will depend as much on capital investments as on skill investments.The focus on agricultural development and support to the farmer continues through direct financial assistance to farmers. The farmers have benefited by getting crop insurance through PM Fasal Bima Yojana. It's not just the farmers, the PM-SVANidhi provides credit assistance to a large number of street vendors.The last few years have seen the journey of affordable housing through Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY). There is a slight increase in allocation to launch a scheme for encouraging the middle class to build or buy new homes. This investment will likely propel a wider economic development and increase employment.India has seen a tremendous rise in entrepreneurship in the last few years. In order to continue the journey and promote new startups, the government proposes to extend certain tax benefits, which are expiring from March 2024 to March 2025. The MSMEs have not been left behind. With a proposal to provide timely finances to such enterprises, the government has paved the way for their growth, so they can look to compete globally.All in all, it’s a truly inclusive budget with a clear focus on development not just by giving away freebies but enabling the people to participate in the economic development activity. While the FM calls the comprehensive GDP - Governance, Development & Performance – to me, this budget is inclusive of another GDP – gender, demography, and professions.","Akhilesh Tuteja is Partner and Head, Clients and Markets, KPMG in India.

‘Enough domestic sources of demand to counter drag from external sector’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/enough-domestic-sources-of-demand-to-counter-drag-from-external-sector/articleshow/107372012.cms,"Do you think the

creates room for lower interest rates?

One of the issues that the Budget has flagged is the demographic challenge and opportunity and the societal change that is taking place. How do you view this?

Niti Aayog is working on the Viksit Bharat roadmap. What will be the focus areas?

You are as much a representative of the Centre as well as the states. Is it time to revisit the entire formula for transfers to states particularly on the issue of cesses and surcharges?

Suman Bery , who heads Niti Aayog , the govt think tank, is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China, which he says is also an opportunity for India. The economist is confident that Indian states remain resilient. Excerpts of the interview with TOI.The finance ministry expects the economy to grow 7% next year. Given the global situation, how do you see the prospects?The belief in the finance ministry is that we have a possible drag coming from the external sector but that we have other sources. We have enough domestic sources of demand. One has to applaud the political and economic judgment of FM in deciding that it was appropriate to pursue the path of fiscal consolidation. There is transparency. What this actually reflects is responsible economic management, which is one reason we are where we are. Second, it also creates a buffer so that there is policy space if we do encounter headwinds.That’s the hope and expectation. We have an independent central bank and an inflation targeting central bank, so it is up to the monetary policy committee to take a call through the monetary policy committee on the repo rate .The PM has said that when India grows its states grow. India is a composite of 37 states and UTs. They are each at very different points in their demographic transition. There are some states where the net replacement rate is down to 1%, like Kerala . There are others, particularly UP and Bihar, which are in their earliest stage of demographic transition and each one of these states is the size of a large European country. There are two implications of that — one is internal labour mobility and it will become an even larger part of our growth model. The govt has taken several steps to create a unified market. Our main endowment is our human capital and that has to be equipped to participate in global exchange in many ways. We know from China, Japan that the demographic dividend partly depends on markets and on human capital. But the golden period is fairly short lived, about 15 years, when the so called dependency ratio declines. The other big opportunity the PM has been highlighting is bringing women much more into the active labour force.When Niti was set up there was the idea of a three-year vision and a seven-year strategy paper. The reality is that schemes of govt tend to be aligned with the award of the Finance Commission . There are various established building blocks or hand holds which are already a matter of govt policy. The PM is much more interested in a national debate on what it means to be a Viksit Bharat or modern society. We have a collective goal and it is for the democratic polity to define what that goal should be. Its emphatically not for a super mandarin bureaucracy. It is not going to be Lee Kwan Yew’s Singapore led from the top.It’s entirely a finance ministry matter but I would be lying if I didn’t say when I visit certain states there is this complaint. A big frontier would be resource mobilisation at the state level. Second is going to be rationalisation of subsidies not only at the Union level, but also at the state level. All chief ministers sit on my governing council. When they convene as the governing council, I see them in their role as development practitioners. The world is beginning to appreciate quite how much institutional and political maturity India attained in our 75 years and the most fundamental dimension of a democracy, we have orderly transfers of power. There are enough buffers to ensure that what happens in state finances is unlikely to create macro instability. Those risks are well contained by our Constitution. The chief ministers know that they are going to be judged by development outcomes and so you can have the sugar rush of changing of pension plans or various handouts but if the cupboard is bare you are not going to be able to deliver.","Suman Bery is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China.

Government's Marathon to 2047: Emphasis on Fiscal Prudence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/governments-marathon-to-2047-emphasis-on-fiscal-prudence/articleshow/107371788.cms,"What was the thinking behind keeping the vote on account absolutely straight?

So is it the idea to keep the Budget completely transparent?

The capex has risen 11.1% and there is an emphasis on infrastructure spending. But there is also the hope that the private sector will now take over and start capital spending. Given the geopolitical situation, how confident is the govt that it will pan out as planned?

Finance secretary T V Somanathan, in an interview with TOI, says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047 . Excerpts:If you see the Budget speech you will see the emphasis on 2047. The govt has set its sight on running that marathon. Running to 2047 is a marathon , it’s not a sprint. If you are going to run a marathon, you need to be in good shape and you can’t have short-term stimulants or something that will get you some yards and then it’s done.The whole focus is on making India a developed country by 2047, for which a healthy present and a strong fiscal position is an important concomitant. Some purely short term measures don’t really fit into that picture. It’s a consistent picture: focus on the long term for which you need to build strength in the short term and that needs to be done by prudence in fiscal policy and by not doing things which can detract you from that path. Not doing the wrong thing is more important than appearing to do things.The idea is that govt finances may be good, bad or indifferent depending on the times, depending on the circumstances, depending on the policies. But what is the position should be reflected as reasonably and accurately as possible. That is an emphasis. As regards the Finance Commission, again the terms of reference that have been given to them are the terms in the Constitution.What is the means by which the devolution should be done is a matter they have full discretion. They can actually take all kinds of factors into account and in a sense we felt this time based on my review of the previous commissions that the right expression would be less is more. The shorter, less prescriptive terms of reference gives full scope for all stakeholders including state govts to express their viewpoints and for the commission to take a balanced view of the different perspectives and then come to its award. Ultimately the award of the Finance Commission is about devolution and grant for which full scope has now been given to them.n There are incipient signs of private capital expenditure accelerating. There are some surveys I have seen done by some of the chambers industry, which show high levels of investment. The PMI, which is a sort of leading indicator, is also looking pretty healthy. Capacity utilisation is one reason that private sector capital expenditure doesn’t immediately pick up when the economy starts accelerating because there is surplus capacity.But increasingly I get the sense that many industries are beginning to reach levels where they have to add capacity. When that happens capital investment will happen. Another pointer also mentioned in the Budget speech you may notice that our airlines have placed large orders for planes — that is capital expenditure.When you import 1,000 aircraft, it’s just not 1,000 aircraft, there are concomitant additions to ground handling facilities, you need airports to expand, you need to employ people to do that. That means a lot of jobs. The aircraft is capital but then look at the effect it is going to have on skilled jobs. So capital expenditure is happening. I am fairly confident that we will have decent capital expenditure in the year to come and that will become a new source of acceleration.",Finance secretary T V Somanathan says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047.

Income Tax Changes Budget 2024 : In the recent Budget 2024 speech, the Finance Minister kept the Section 80C tax deduction limit unchanged. The maximum limit for claiming tax benefits under Section 80C remains at Rs 1.5 lakh for the current fiscal year 2023-24 and will stay the same for individuals looking to save on taxes through Section 80C investments in the upcoming fiscal year 2024-25.Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions. Individuals can reduce their gross taxable income by up to Rs 1.5 lakh per financial year by engaging in these specific investments or expenditures.You can save on taxes through Section 80C by investing in things like Employees' Provident Fund (EPF), Public Provident Fund (PPF), Equity Linked Saving Scheme (ELSS) mutual funds, National Savings Certificate (NSC), and 5-year tax-saving fixed deposits with banks or post offices. Additionally, paying life insurance policy premiums also qualifies for tax benefits under Section 80C.It is important to note that each eligible investment comes with its specific maximum limit, rate of return, liquidity, and taxation rules for the earned returns, states ET in a report. For instance, the most you can invest in PPF in a financial year is Rs 1.5 lakh. Meanwhile, there's no limit on the amount you can invest in ELSS mutual funds, but the Section 80C deduction is capped at Rs 1.5 lakh.If individuals can't make specific investments, they can still get deductions under Section 80C from their gross taxable income through certain expenses. These expenses include repaying the principal amount of a home loan, tuition fees for children, payment of stamp duty, registration fees, and other costs related to buying a house.Since the financial year 2020-21, individuals without any business income must annually choose between the old and new tax regimes. As of the fiscal year 2023-24, the new tax regime is the default option. Consequently, individuals seeking tax deductions under Section 80C must opt for the old tax regime since this deduction isn't available in the new tax regime. It's crucial for taxpayers to be aware of these rules to make informed decisions about their tax planning and investment strategies.","Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget which is an interim budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year. The budget talks about inclusive development both, social and geographical, especially for youth, women, farmers, and the poor. Continued focus on improving logistics through infrastructure spend on roads, rail, airports, ports increases productivity for companies and citizens alike.To make ‘Viksit Bharat’ by 2047, the government’s focus is on improving and empowering people’s capabilities through various skilling initiatives. It is encouraging to see that Skill India Mission has succeeded in training more than 1.4 crore youth and upskilling and reskilling 54 lakh youth. I am particularly happy to see the continued focus on youth and women entrepreneurship and the announcement of a new fund which will give interest free 50 year loans for startups will provide a domestic fillip to startups supplementing venture capital we have traditionally relied on from abroad.PM Mudra Yojana has sanctioned 43 crore loans aggregating to 22.5 lakh crore to youth entrepreneurs and thirty crore Mudra Yojana loans to women entrepreneurs. There are several other schemes like Fund of Funds, Start-Up India, and Start-Up Credit Guarantee schemes that are assisting our youth. Further, the extension of tax benefits to Start-ups and investments made by sovereign wealth funds/pension funds, till 31st March 2025 depicts the government’s effort to support the startup eco- system.This aligns quite well with India Sanitation Coalition’s efforts to give impetus to the start-up world. Over the past 7 editions of our ISC-FICCI Sanitation Awards, we have recognized and promoted several start-ups in the sanitation space, many of whom are successful businesses now!While the finance minister did not provide detailed information on Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH), the budget allocation sees a slight increase in spend demonstrating continued focus on this highly successful program. The acknowledgement that the private sector has increasingly played a substantial role in addressing WASH issues in both urban and rural areas, with numerous projects underway through Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs), highlights the government's commitment to addressing challenges in this sector.A perfect example is the LightHouse Initiative initiated by the Department of Drinking Water along with the India Sanitation Coalition (ISC) by partnering with major corporates across India to develop model villages in Solid and Liquid Waste Management (SLWM) under SBM-Grameen. From this budget, there is an expectation that the government will persist in prioritizing Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) as the path toward achieving the country's Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6). Additionally, it is hoped that the government will uphold its commitment to making necessary infrastructural investments for SLWM.The budget speech rightly celebrates the fact that we have 83 lakh SHGs and 9 crore women beneficiaries. The microfinance movement in the country and the possibility of empowering women members of SHGs through livelihood skilling is a key to bringing women into mainstream economic advancement.The focus on green growth, rooftop solar, wind, biomass, e-vehicles all help with our green energy thrust. The tourism sector was mentioned and could be a huge job provider for youth and women.Guided by the principle ‘Reform, Perform, and Transform’, the budget emphasizes efficient implementation of various policies by improving coordination with states and relevant stakeholders. This is critical both for infra spend and social programsIt is noteworthy that ISC’s Climate Resilient Coastal Cities project which is being implemented in PPP (Public-Private Partnership) mode in four coastal states of Karnataka, Gujarat, Goa and Maharashtra is congruent with the government’s priority of promoting climate-resilient activities for the blue economy 2.0, a scheme for restoration and adaptation measures, and coastal aquaculture.The budget also focuses on the Aspirational districts program where assistance will be given to the states for faster development of aspirational districts and blocks, including the generation of ample economic opportunities. This is again very crucial as it has a huge potential to transform the landscape of our country while making sure no -one is left behind.Overall, this budget has embraced economic strategies and develops the building blocks that nurture and uphold growth, promote inclusive and sustainable development, and enhance productivity.","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year.

Life insurers' stocks rally on 'low impact' of new norms,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/life-insurers-stocks-rally-on-low-impact-of-new-norms/articleshow/111009979.cms,"Mumbai: Shares of life insurance companies rallied after the regulator announced new norms requiring them to provide higher surrender value than what they have been paying out. The relief rally was triggered by realization that the impact on margins would be far less than estimated because insurers front-end most of their costs into the first year which has been excluded from surrender value norms.

Shares of HDFC Life, SBI Life, ICICI Pru Life, Max Financial and Life Insurance Corporation have all rallied in the last two days after the new norms.

The shares of life insurance companies have been under pressure since December 2023, when the insurance regulator first proposed increasing surrender charges. The product regulations in March 2024, however, did not alter the guaranteed surrender values. The situation changed again on May 30, when the regulator introduced a fresh draft that included the regulation of special surrender value. This new development was perceived to have an impact on new business margins of up to 3-4%.

On June 12, the regulations were officially announced by Irdai. The first year was excluded from SSV norms, a move that could have hurt margins. Additionally, insurers were granted the flexibility to discount returns at a higher rate of 50 basis points over the government securities yield, as opposed to the previous benchmark of the 10-year G-sec yield. According to a report by JM Financial, insurers can mitigate the pressure on margins by passing on the potential loss to intermediaries or the customer.

The second option is to offer a slightly lower return on non-participating products where insurers have no competition on providing guaranteed returns.

","HDFC Life, SBI Life, ICICI Pru Life, Max Financial and Life Insurance Corporation have all rallied. The relief rally was triggered by realization that the impact on margins would be far less than estimated. The shares of life insurance companies have been under pressure since December 2023.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111010018,imgsize-1039143,width-400,resizemode-4/111010018.jpg"
Trai asks fin cos to use new prefix for service calls,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/trai-asks-fin-cos-to-use-new-prefix-for-service-calls/articleshow/111009974.cms,"Mumbai: To check the menace of impersonation frauds , telecom regulator Trai on Friday met financial sector regulators , 25 banks and financial institutions, and other industry representatives to ensure that official calls are made from numbers prefixed with a dedicated number series that can be identified by the receiver.Trai suggested allocating the 160 series prefix exclusively for transactional and service voice calls. Initially, it will be for entities regulated by RBI, Sebi, Irdai, and PFRDA, making it easier to identify callers and prevent fraud.The meeting discussed how to effectively use this series, migrate the 140 series (for sales) to a new platform, and implement digital consent scrubbing to reduce spam calls.The telecom service providers and members of the Association of National Exchange Members were also present in the meeting.The Digital Consent Facility, which allows banks and other entities to send promotional messages, was also discussed. The meeting emphasized the obligations of senders under Trai regulations and agreed to whitelist URLs, use minimum headers and content templates, and take immediate action against misuse. While prefixing the series to numbers will help to identify genuine calls from institutions, whitelisting of headers can help check fraud messages.Meanwhile Irdai, in a circular, became the first to bar companies from using 10-digit mobile numbers to make calls to existing or prospective customers and use the 140/160 series allotted by the telecom regulator. Irdai's circular to all regulated entities follows the telecom regulator's new guidelines aimed at curbing unsolicited voice calls or messages.Most of the frauds that are undertaken by criminals impersonating bankers, insurance or other government officials is being perpetuated through private mobile numbers.Insurance companies have also been asked to take steps to spread awareness among customers, in local language as well, about the remedial actions/ steps to be taken in various scenarios such as ONO Registration, Registration of Complaints.","Trai suggested allocating the 160 series prefix exclusively for transactional and service voice calls.

Porsche Taycan Driver: Juvenile Justice Board Extends Teenager's Remand Till June 25 Due to Threat to Life,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/juvenile-justice-board-extends-teenagers-remand-till-june-25-due-to-threat-to-life/articleshow/110951818.cms,"PUNE: The prosecution on Wednesday told the Juvenile Justice Board (JJB) that the remand of the 17-year-old Porsche Taycan driver in an observation home needed to be extended as there was “a threat to his life outside” and also there was nobody to take care of him since his parents and grandfather were in police custody .Special assistant public prosecutor Monali Kale also told JJB’s officiating principal magistrate Akshi Jain that the police were yet to receive the teenager’s final de-addiction and psychological evaluation reports. Besides, the minor’s identity had become public after videos of events following the May 19 crash went viral on social media, Kale said.The teenager’s parents were in police custody till June 20 on charges of aiding the manipulation of his blood alcohol report while his grandfather was lodged in Yerawada central jail as part of his judicial custody in the case of abduction of their family driver to force him take the blame for the accident, Kale said. The police were continuing with their investigation into the car crash, the prosecutor added.The 17-year-old was first sent to the observation home on May 22.His detention was further extended on June 5 till June 12. On Wednesday, crime branch’s investigating officer ACP Sunil Tambe submitted a fresh plea through the prosecutor seeking a 14-day extension of the remand.Lawyer Prashant Patil, representing the teenager, however, cited section 12 (bail to a person who is apparently a child alleged to be in conflict with law) of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act to claim that the detention of the child in conflict with law had become illegal and that he should be released on bail.Patil also said that the minor had cooperated with the investigating officer during questioning under detention. He pleaded with the court not to extend his detention as the minor wanted to pursue higher education by seeking admission in a college after having passed his Standard XII board examination. The lawyer cited a Supreme Court verdict in Shilpa Mittal vs State of NCT of Delhi and said section 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) of the Indian Penal Code could not be treated as heinous crime under the JJ Act.After hearing both sides, the principal magistrate extended the teenager’s detention in the observation home till June 25. At 2.30 am on May 19, the 17-year-old allegedly rammed the Porsche into a motorcycle in Kalyaninagar, killing two software engineers on it.","The 17-year-old Porsche Taycan driver was sent to the observation home on May 22.

Criminal Laws: App To Help Roll Out New Criminal Laws,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/app-to-help-roll-out-new-criminal-laws/articleshow/110950414.cms,"NEW DELHI: Delhi Police is working on an app that will help investigating officers in fulfilling the requirements of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), which is set to be rolled out on July 1. The app will help the cops in filming the crime scene and preserving recordings besides submitting all this to courts.The app is likely to handle videos, audio recordings and pictures from the crime scene and allow the investigating officers to directly upload these, sources said.With barely two weeks left for the rollout of the new laws, the police brass is learnt to be fine-tuning the app with the help of technical experts. The focus is on preserving the sanctity of digital evidence, something which Union home minister Amit Shah was keen on, said an officer.On July 1, Indian Penal Code, Criminal Procedure Code and Indian Evidence Act will cease to exist and all FIRs of criminal offences will be registered under BNS. Instead of Indian Evidence Act, Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam will kick in as well. CrPC will be replaced by Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita which defines the updated procedures and time-limits for criminal investigation and trial and needs full digital integration of all arms of the criminal justice system, including courts.The police brass has imparted the training for implementation of the new laws to over 15,000 personnel, including assistant sub-inspectors and sub-inspectors, who function as IOs and even SHOs and ACPs.Most cops at the police station level have either received training or have been acquainted with the new laws through a booklet. The police brass seems confident of rolling out the new laws with special CP Chhaya Sharma handling training and the two law and order chiefs — Ravindra Yadav and Madhup Tiwari — having been tasked with ensuring seamless transition at the police station level.Lieutenant governor VK Saxena has been seeking regular updates from the police commissioner. While a key review meeting is to be held on Saturday where the police brass will take stock of the preparations, a series of meetings, including with the ministry of home affairs and LG, are lined up for the next two weeks.While BNS retains most offences from IPC, some of the features stand out. For example, it adds community service as a form of punishment. Organised crime is an offence and so is petty organised crime. Sedition is no longer an offence and has been replaced by a broader offence which comes under ‘acts endangering the sovereignty, unity and integrity of India’.Terrorism is also listed as an offence and cops need not rely only on UAPA. Mob lynching — murder or grievous hurt by five or more people on specified grounds like race, caste, sex and language – is also a separate offence now.","The app is likely to handle videos, audio recordings and pictures from the crime scene and allow the investigating officers to directly upload these, sources said.

US court levies $194 million penalty on TCS,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-court-levies-194-million-penalty-on-tcs/articleshow/111007461.cms,"BENGALURU: A US court has imposed a $194 million penalty on TCS for misappropriation of US IT services firm DXC 's ((formerly CSC) trade secrets. The court said that TCS is liable to pay CSC $56 million in compensatory damages and $112 million in exemplary damages. The court also said TCS is liable for $25 million in prejudgment interest through June 13,. It also passed certain injunctions and other reliefs against TCS.

TOI had reported last year that the US jury said TCS accessed a trade secret by infringing CSC’s proprietary platforms. The latest award is a big setback to TCS after the US Supreme Court confirmed a punitive damages award of $140 million in the Epic Systems case for accessing its web portal without authorisation.

In 2018, TCS bagged a $2.5-billion deal from US-based insurer Transamerica to enhance its digital capabilities and simplify the service of more than 10 million policies into a single integrated platform. However, in June last year, Transamerica scrapped a $2 billion, 10-year deal with TCS citing the challenging macroeconomic conditions.

The DXC lawsuit in 2019 alleged that most of the former Transamerica/ MSI employees who were employed by TCS had been administering and processing policies at Transamerica / MSI using CSC software. The lawsuit cited emails exchanged between TCS employees to allege that they found the necessary solution in the Vantage software. Later, a TCS employee allegedly copied and pasted the actual Vantage source code pertaining to this calculation, and resulting Vantage calculations, into an email and sent it to his TCS colleagues. VantageOne and DXC Wealth Management Accelerator enable insurance functions including managing policies and creating new products.

TCS, a regulatory filing said, the judgement has no major adverse impact on its financials and operations.

NEW DELHI: Tesla shareholders voted on Thursday to reinstate CEO Elon Musk 's $44.9 billion pay package, which had been previously thrown out by a Delaware judge earlier this year.Although the vote totals were not immediately disclosed, the favorable outcome does not guarantee that Musk will receive the all-stock compensation in the near future, as the package is expected to remain tied up in the Delaware Chancery Court for several months while Tesla pursues an appeal.In January, Chancellor Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick issued a ruling in a lawsuit brought by a shareholder. The ruling stated that Musk held control over the Tesla board when it approved the package in 2018, and the that the board did not provide information to the shareholders who approved the package during the same year.Tesla has said that it would appeal the decision but requested that shareholders reapprove the package at the company's annual meeting in Austin, Texas Tesla shareholders are deciding the company's future as they conclude voting on whether to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's substantial compensation package, which was rejected by a Delaware judge.The company's shares increased on Thursday after Tesla disclosed in a regulatory filing that shareholders are voting to approve Musk's pay, valued at approximately $44.9 billion, with a modest gain of just under 3%, reaching $182.47 per share.However, the company's stock has experienced a decline of approximately 25% since the beginning of the year.In a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Tesla shared Musk's own posts from late Wednesday on X, the social media platform he owns, which included charts suggesting that shareholders supported his pay package and a proposal to relocate Tesla's legal home from Delaware to Texas.In a recent regulatory filing from April, Tesla disclosed that the value of the package had decreased to $44.9 billion.The package's worth, which had previously reached as high as $56 billion, has fallen alongside Tesla's stock price, which has experienced a decline since the beginning of the year.Legal experts caution that disclosing vote totals while balloting is ongoing could create issues for Tesla, which may explain why the company made the filing with the SEC, as the agency is likely to investigate the matter.A retired professor and founder of the corporate governance center at the University of Delaware, Charles Elson said, ""Anytime you tell people you're winning, you're encouraging others to join you and those who oppose you to pull back,"" Elson added that releasing corporate proxy vote totals before the end of the balloting process is ""highly unusual.""Elon Musk's social media posts have previously attracted attention from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Tesla and Musk were fined a total of $40 million for statements he made on Twitter, prior to his acquisition of the platform, regarding funding to make Tesla a private company.The approval of Musk's compensation package would nearly ensure his continued involvement with the company he has built into the global leader in electric vehicles . Tesla is also expanding into artificial intelligence and robotics, including self-driving vehicles, which Musk believes represents the company's future.If the pay package is approved, it would almost guarantee that Musk would remain at the company he grew to be the world leader in electric vehicles, shifting to AI and robotics including autonomous vehicles, which Musk says is Tesla's future.But if shareholders were to vote against his pay, the CEO might follow through on his warnings to pursue artificial intelligence research at one of his other ventures, or even depart from Tesla entirely.Even with shareholder approval, uncertainties remain.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.

Sarvam AI is building large language models targeted at unique uses in Indian languages at price points that the country’s 1.4 billion people can afford. The Series A funding round was led by Lightspeed Venture Partners , and participants included Silicon Valley billionaire Vinod Khosla’s Khosla Ventures and Peak XV Partners , formerly Sequoia Capital India & Southeast Asia, Sarvam said Thursday.

The Bangalore-based startup, until recently in stealth mode, was co-founded by Vivek Raghavan and Pratyush Kumar. It has ambitious plans to build open source foundational AI systems as well as tools for creating apps for the meager compute infrastructure available to developers in India. The startup has a total of 18 employees and is just opening an office in the city.

""What we are showing is that you can build large language models with limited resources,” Raghavan said in a phone interview. ""We are building at a smaller scale and demonstrating that these can be extremely cost and energy efficient so they can be accessed by everyone.""

Large language models, like OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Meta Platforms Inc.’s Llama, are powerful AI systems that understand by learning from vast amounts of diverse data from the internet and elsewhere to summarize, translate, and create text, audio and video for a wide range of applications. The rivalry to develop ever-more sophisticated models is heating up in Silicon Valley and such efforts have attracted billions of dollars in investments.
