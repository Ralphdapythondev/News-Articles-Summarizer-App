Check penalties, consequences for late filing",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/taxation/itr-filing-fy-2023-24-what-happens-if-i-file-income-tax-return-after-deadline-check-penalties-consequences-for-late-filing/articleshow/112105116.cms,"What is the penalty for belated ITR filing?

Who is required to pay the penalty?

Income Exceeds Basic Exemption Limit: Taxpayers whose income exceeds the basic exemption limit will be penalised for late filing. The limit varies by tax regime: Rs 3 lakh under the new tax regime, irrespective of age, and different limits under the old tax regime based on age.

Section 139(1) Conditions: Even if income is below the exemption limit, taxpayers must file an ITR if they meet specific conditions in Section 139(1). These include:

Spending Rs 2 lakh or more on foreign travel. Paying Rs 1 lakh or more in electricity bills. Depositing Rs 1 crore or more in current accounts.

Holding Foreign Assets: Residents with foreign assets or income must file an ITR, even if their income is below the exemption limit. Late filing fees apply in these cases.

Exceptions to Penalties

How is a belated ITR filed?

Income Tax Return Filing FY 2023-24 : For individual taxpayers whose accounts do not need auditing, the last date to file income tax returns (ITRs) for FY 2023–24 (AY 2024–25) is July 31, 2024. Missing this deadline means filing a belated ITR , which comes with penalties and interest.Under Section 234F of the Income Tax Act, 1961, filing a belated ITR incurs a penalty of up to Rs 5,000.For small taxpayers with a taxable income not exceeding Rs 5 lakh, the penalty is restricted to Rs 1,000, according to an ET report. The important thing to note is that this penalty applies even if the belated ITR shows zero tax payable. Additionally, penal interest on the pending tax payable must be paid when filing a belated ITR.Certain taxpayers are required to pay penalties if they miss the ITR filing deadline and they fulfil the following conditions:Also Read | ITR refund status for FY 2023-24: How to check income tax refund status online - here’s a step-by-step guide for incometax.gov.in & NSDL websites Individuals might need to submit an income tax return to receive a refund.

This means the gross taxable income is considered before any eligible deductions are accounted for.The process for filing a belated ITR is the same as filing on time, with the key difference being the selection of Section 139(4) instead of 139(1) on the ITR form.","Filing a belated ITR incurs a penalty of up to Rs 5,000 under the Income Tax Act, 1961.

The NSE Nifty 50 and the S&P BSE Sensex, experienced declines, deviating from the generally optimistic global market sentiment.The Nifty 50 fell by 0.26% to close at 23,992.55, while the Sensex ended the day 0.21% lower at 78,593.07.This downward movement was attributed to profit-taking by investors, with analysts pointing to valuation concerns and global uncertainties as factors negatively impacting market sentiment.Earlier in the day, the indices had shown promise, rising approximately 1.2% following a worldwide sell-off on Monday that erased around $250 billion from the market capitalization of Indian equities .Avinash Gorakshakar, head of research at Profitmart Securities, told Reuters, ""What happened in Indian equities on Monday was an over-reaction, but our markets were due for a correction and will remain subdued as investors await clarity on U.S. economy and rate cut trajectory.""He further noted that no major segment in the Indian markets is currently trading at attractive valuations, which is also affecting buying interest.The performance of Indian benchmarks stood in contrast to the largely positive sentiment observed in most Asian markets and the recovery of U.S. stock index futures.The MSCI Asia ex-Japan index, for instance, rose by about 1%. Within the Indian market, high-weightage financial stocks fell by 1.07%, primarily due to a nearly 1% drop in HDFC Bank, a leading private lender. Analysts suggested that while heavyweight stocks like HDFC Bank offer capital protection, they are unlikely to generate high returns in the near future, prompting some investors to realize profits.On the other hand, information technology companies, which derive a substantial portion of their revenue from the U.S., experienced a 0.49% gain, following a 3.26% drop on Monday. Textile manufacturers such as Welspun Living, Trident, Gokaldas Exports, and KPR Mill saw significant gains ranging from 2.9% to 15% amidst political unrest in Bangladesh. At least one analyst suggested that major brands may consider India as an alternative sourcing destination. The broader, more domestically focused small-cap and mid-cap indices also experienced declines of approximately 0.4% and 0.6%, respectively.","The Nifty 50 fell by 0.26% to close at 23,992.55, while the Sensex ended the day 0.21% lower at 78,593.07.

The company is accused of failing to pay Integrated GST on services imported from its overseas branches.Based on an incident report by DGGI's Bangalore zonal unit, Infosys was required to pay GST under the reverse charge mechanism (RCM), which mandates the service recipient to pay the tax. Integrated GST applies to imports and inter-state transactions of goods and services.Infosys has disputed the allegations, stating, ""The company believes that as per regulations, GST is not applicable on these expenses. Additionally, as per a recent circular issued by the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs on the recommendations of the GST Council, services provided by the overseas branches to Indian entity are not subject to GST. It is also important to note that the GST payments are eligible for credit or refund against export of IT services.

This compares with a volume growth of 7.5% the sector had seen in the year-ago quarter and 6.5% in the preceding (March) quarter.NielsenIQ India’s head of customer success Roosevelt Dsouza attributed the deceleration in volumes largely to macroeconomic headwinds.“Our hypothesis is that unemployment is rising, highest in (month) June 2024,” said analysts at NielsenIQ.While rural volume growth continues to outpace the growth in urban areas, both regions experienced softer consumption in the quarter. Urban volume growth declined to 2.8% in the June quarter from 5.7% in the March quarter.Rural consumption growth at 5.2% in the April-June period is lower than the 7.6% growth it recorded in the previous quarter. Consumption of staples like packaged salt, packaged atta, palm oil as well as personal care and home care categories took a hit across both markets as consumers tightened purse strings. In rural regions, high contributing categories like laundry and utensil cleaners within homecare witnessed slow consumption, NielsenIQ said.Value growth for the industry stood at 4% in the June quarter, lower than 12.2% in the year-ago period and 6.6% in the previous quarter.Rural consumption still fared better than its urban counterparts because of the price cuts that several companies took in the earlier quarters to fuel demand in rural regions. Also, firms like Dabur and Nestle have been heavily expanding their rural coverage, bringing more people within the fold of branded consumption, said independent consultant Akshay D’souza, adding that decent monsoons and start of festivities later this month should further help rural consumption.FMCG companies, which have been grappling with tepid growth largely on the back of rural slowdown. have been betting on good monsoons to spur demand.Volume growth in the food category stood at 2.4% in the June quarter compared to 4.8% in the Jan-March period. In the non-food segment, volume growth was at 7.6% in the quarter, a drop from 11.1% in the March quarter with the decline steeper in urban. India’s largest consumer goods company HUL had last month said that while on a two-year CAGR (compound annual growth rate) basis, urban is still growing ahead of rural, growth in rural has started to pick up with the regions outpacing urban in the last couple of months.","The FMCG industry recorded a volume growth of 3.8% during the quarter, the lowest in over a year.

Why investors are getting concerned with India's heatwaves,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-investors-are-getting-concerned-with-indias-heatwaves/articleshow/112390188.cms,"India’s sweltering summer is the latest worry for companies already hit by slowing earnings growth and ongoing supply chain disruptions.The heatwave featured no fewer than 80 times in earnings calls for the quarter ended June — an all-time high — data of Nifty 500 companies compiled by Bloomberg showed. That’s a significant jump from just seven mentions in the year-ago period.India faced near-record temperatures this summer as a devastating heatwave gripped most parts of the country including its financial hub Mumbai and the capital city of New Delhi. This affected footfalls at retailers, hindered labor productivity at construction firms and made it more difficult for lenders to collect loan payments.“One risk that I tend to mention for India is climate change” when investors ask about the biggest risks facing the nation’s stock market rally, said Jonathan Garner, chief Asia and emerging market equity strategist at Morgan Stanley.Of the 46 NSE Nifty 50 Index members that have posted results so far, about half missed the average analyst estimate. That’s a sharp increase from the previous three months, where 39% firms missed expectations.While heatwave was a recurring theme in many earnings transcripts, high raw-material costs driven by geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and disruptions to shipping routes were also significant factors.Food delivery firm Zomato Ltd said the heatwave was one of the factors that led to sequentially lower margins. Infrastructure giant Larsen & Toubro Ltd said it tried mitigating the heat risk by having worker shifts early in the morning and late in the afternoon.Worsening climate conditions have yielded some winners too. Whirlpool of India Ltd and stabilizer manufacturer V-Guard Industries Ltd benefited from summer-led demand. Power generators including state-owned NTPC Ltd reported better-than-expected sales in the June quarter, partly boosted by a record demand in the summer months.For the rest, the situation will only get tougher as extreme weather incidents are expected to surge. In the next 30 years, the length of heatwaves in India is set to increase 25-fold, according to Group of 20’s Climate Risk Atlas.“We see inconsistencies in the market’s pricing of climate risks,” said Vlad Byalik, emerging markets value portfolio manager at Ariel Investments LLC. “Market often overreacts to short-term events while under-appreciating longer-term trends, which is in part driven by the climate issue.”","India faced near-record temperatures this summer as a devastating heatwave gripped most parts of the country.

RBI holds repo rate for 9th time in a row at 6.5%,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rbi-holds-repo-rate-for-9th-time-in-a-row-at-6-5/articleshow/112388550.cms,"MUMBAI: RBI on Thursday decided to keep policy rates on hold for the ninth consecutive time, citing strong demand and the need to maintain inflation ’s declining trajectory. The central bank said that there is a need to remain vigilant amid the backdrop of “large and persistent” supply side shocks in food items.The six-member monetary policy committee voted 4:2 to keep the repo rate — the rate at which the central banks lends to banks — at 6.5% and to continue focusing on withdrawing accommodation to align inflation with the target while supporting growth .“Growth remains resilient, inflation has been trending downward and we have made progress in achieving price stability; but we have more distance to cover.The progress towards our goal of price stability has been uneven due to large and persistent supply side shocks, especially in food items. We need to remain vigilant to ensure that inflation moves sustainably towards the target, while supporting growth. This approach would be net positive for sustained high growth,” Das said in a statement after the meeting of the monetary policy committee.Although the policy maintained a status quo in terms of action, many read the governor’s statement as hawkish. Particularly his comments cautioning banks on growing credit faster than deposits. Das asked banks to beef up household deposit mobilisation by leveraging their branch network and through innovative service offerings.Das retained the growth forecast for FY25 at 7.2% but cut down the forecast for Q1FY25 to 7.1% from 7.3% earlier due to updated information on high-frequency indicators, which show lower than anticipated corporate profitability, general government expenditure and core industries output. The governor also retained the inflation forecast for FY25 at 4.5% even as he tweaked quarterly forecasts.According to RBI, the slowdown in deposits is partly because of a winding down of precautionary savings that households have built up during Covid when avenues were limited.",The six-member monetary policy committee voted 4:2 to keep the repo rate — the rate at which the central banks lends to banks — at 6.5%.

LIC looks to acquire health insurance companies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/lic-looks-to-acquire-health-insurance-companies/articleshow/112388530.cms,"MUMBAI: LIC plans to take the acquisition route to get into the health insurance business , said MD & CEO Siddhartha Mohanty.During the announcement of the company’s financial results for the first quarter, Mohanty said that the company is looking at an acquisition during the current financial year. “Rather than set up a vertical for insurance, we felt that we can acquire a company which will allow us to start selling health insurance across the country,” said Mohanty.LIC has over 14.1 lakh agents, which is among the largest agency force among insurance companies worldwide.According to sources, most of the corporation’s agents are already distributing health insurance for other private companies as regulations permit an agent to work for life and non-life companies. These agents are expected to switch to selling LIC products.Industry sources said that health insurance is increasingly becoming a ‘pull’ product, with many young buyers actively seeking coverage. This presents an opportunity for agents to engage with potential customers. Therefore, the availability of health insurance is expected to benefit the life insurance business as well.At present, there are five established standalone health insurance companies — Star Health & Allied Insurance, Niva Bupa, Aditya Birla Health Insurance, Care Health Insurance and ManipalCigna Health Insurance. The regulator has also recently granted permission to two other health insurers — Galaxy Health and Narayana Health.LIC on Thursday reported a 9.6% increase in net profit for the June quarter, reaching Rs 10,461 crore compared to Rs 9,544 crore in the same period last year.The corporation’s market share of first year premium income rose to 64%, up from 61.4% year-over-year.

Railway Budget 2024 : The government has wavered little in its efforts to spur a modernisation of railways in the country, pivoting on technology, to support the country’s economic ambitions. In line with expectations, Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore, marking yet another year of successive increase in outlay.That takes forward the past policies and the government’s vision, which have paved the way for modernisation of the transport behemoth.In earlier decades, the government had focused on laying tracks on new routes, electrification and incremental rolling stock capacity addition. That was the need of the hour back then and has helped set up the base for a larger transformation.For instance, the massive Dedicated Freight Corridor ( DFC ) as well as locomotive factories at Marhaura and Madhepura in Bihar were conceptualised over a decade ago and we are seeing their completion now.More recently, the focus has shifted to modernisation—of rolling stock and safety systems, among other aspects.This year, emphasis has also been laid on the railways’ crucial role in industrial development. Commodity-specific corridors have been planned in eastern India and impetus given to port connectivity. Vande Bharat and technology-led upgrades in rolling stock remain in focus. Safety has been prioritised through budgetary allocations for the anti-collision systemKavach . That said, there are other cogs in the wheel that demand attention from a long-term perspective.First, the target for the Operating Ratio, the crucial efficiency gauge, has been set at 98.22% for 2024-25, compared with 98.65% in 2023-24. This reflects an imminent need for operational transformation. An effective overhaul of the world’s fourth-largest rail network will take many years and thus we need to start focusing on improving efficiency and reducing costs now.DFC is almost entirely operational and will be complete over the next few months. To ensure the project achieves its twin goals of reducing logistics costs and enhancing freight efficiency, railways need to attract more cargo on the corridor. This will help increase the rail coefficient and make the railways’ approach more market-oriented, which will in turn aid future corridors.A revamp of railway stations is on track, with sufficient funds dedicated to this end. But even though new coaches and wagons are increasingly being added to meet footfalls, the stations and passenger trains themselves remain synonymous with chaos.Just as safety, comfort and convenience have been prioritised, there is a need for solutions to address the capacity and demand challenges. As a first step, the government could target development of new stations and setting up of new coach production units.As a leading freight mover, Indian Railways carried a record 1,588 MT cargo in fiscal 2024, up from 1,095 MT in fiscal 2015. It accounts for 26% of the cargo moved in the country—by no means an easy feat. The railways aims to take this volume to 3,000 MT by 2030, which would require a 11% CAGR against the around 4.2% witnessed over the last 10 years. As per a report by TERI and Shakti Foundation, from carrying about 62% of freight traffic in 1990-91, Indian Railways’ share has declined to ~27% in 2014-15. This has been due to the expanding road network, cost competitiveness over railways, and door-to-door service. Thus, commencing the cycle of increasing the rail share again is commendable.DFCs, a high-capacity track network, high-power locomotives and improvement in wagon designs have set the ball rolling for larger capacity, faster freight trains that deliver better efficiency.Yet, achieving exponential growth is a tall ask given the current dynamics. Possibly, similar challenges might apply to other goals the railways might have for 2047.To be fair, despite its scale and complexity, Indian Railways has been able to achieve diverse developments at commendable speed.But the track ahead is long and it is time to start discussing the reinvention of the institutional set-up.Indian Railways sees substantial private sector involvement in the form of vendors and contractors. Policymakers could start mulling extreme options such as parallel privately-owned and operated railway infrastructure, coupled with centralised planning and an evolved role for the railways. This will need a robust policy framework from the Government of India.The time is perhaps also ripe to bring user charge and asset monetisation-driven segments for passengers as well as cargo to the discussion table. Globally, the separation of infrastructure and operations in railways has delivered mixed results, for example in the United Kingdom. The model should be analysed and revisited to understand its potential relevance in the Indian context.The key would be to retrace our steps and align our long-term goals to identify not just incremental changes but also ways to explore bold and path-breaking alternatives that put Indian Railways on a smooth track and bring it up to speed.","Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore.

Budget 2024 capital gains tax changes: The Narendra Modi government is considering suggestions for tweaks in the new long term capital gains tax regime that was announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman in Union Budget 2024.The July 23 budget reduced the LTCG tax on property from 20% to 12.5%. The indexation benefit, which allowed taxpayers to adjust the acquisition cost for inflation before calculating capital gains and thus reduce their tax liability, is proposed to be eliminated for properties purchased on or after April 1, 2001.The government publishes the Cost Inflation Index (CII) annually for this calculation.India Inc is appealing to the government for a gradual shift to the long-term capital gains tax regime proposed in the FY25 budget, which aims to eliminate indexation benefits for property, gold, and other unlisted assets.According to an ET report by Deepshikha Sikarwar, the industry is suggesting alternatives such as a higher tax rate with indexation or a lower rate of 12.5% without indexation, as well as some form of grandfathering for ancestral properties.The finance ministry is currently reviewing these proposals and will discuss them with the Prime Minister's Office. The final decision will be made closer to the date when the Finance Bill reply is to be presented in Parliament, the reports said.Industry groups are expected to submit formal proposals to the finance ministry in the near future.

Budget 2024 for manufacturing sector : The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth. While the middle class has been offered tax relief, the government's primary focus remains on judicious spending to maximize economic impact. The budget's core themes are employment, skilling, MSME development, and support for the middle class.Largely focus has remained intact on spending money judiciously to ensure that each penny spent creates a ripple effect in the entire economic landscape.Although at first glance, manufacturing might appear to have taken a backseat, a deeper analysis reveals a multifaceted approach to bolstering the sector. Initiatives like employment-linked benefits and internship programs, while primarily aimed at job creation and skill development, indirectly benefit manufacturing companies by expanding the talent pool.Extensive focus on the MSME manufacturing units by way of extending term loan facility for purchase of machinery and equipment without collateral or third-party guarantee, would help companies in augmenting their capital base/ capacity and strengthen the very foundation of the manufacturing ecosystem in the country. Development of a new credit-assessment model by Public Sector Banks to assess MSME credit shall provide much needed regulatory relief to the units.With respect to the large manufacturing entities, while there is no direct fiscal/ tax incentive introduced in this budget, some support has been provided with an extensive focus on development of ‘industrial parks’ in nearly 100 cities under the ‘plug and play’ model. Reforms proposed with respect to land administration, planning and management, shall also ease out acquisition related difficulties often faced by entrepreneurs/ business houses in acquiring lands for manufacturing set-ups.Targeted Customs duty interventions like, rationalization of Customs duty provisions in Mobile phone manufacturing setups, extension of Customs duty exemption on import of capital goods for manufacturing of solar cells and panels, full Customs duty exemption on import of 25 critical minerals,, shall provide the required impetus for enhancing domestic manufacturing environment.Governments’ focus on formulating an Economic Policy Framework to set the scope for next-gen reforms in the country, has a target to improve the productivity of factors of production, namely, land, labour, capital, entrepreneurship and technology. This shall pave the way for enabling achievement of a target of 25% manufacturing sector contribution to the nation’s GDP over the course of next 7-10 years.While the overall outlook is positive, the extension of tax benefits under Section 115BAB for manufacturing entities and the absence of new PLI schemes are notable omissions.The country’s manufacturing base is expanding as is reflective from the continuously increasing tax collections and expanding Purchasing Manager’s Index. It would be pertinent to see how the ground realities evolve vis-à-vis the vision envisaged, in the upcoming Financial Year.","The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth.

Budget 2024: Armed with the vision to propel India to become a developed country by 2047, the Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business thereby providing the required stimulus to the manufacturing sector and enabling large scale job creation.On the Indirect tax front, the industry welcomes the much-needed announcement for a comprehensive review of the rate structure under Customs enabling ease in product classification and dispute reduction. The proposal of lowering of Customs duty on a plethora of raw materials and products including solar cells, critical minerals and bullion are encouraging measures. The rationale behind such reduction clearly indicates support towards domestic manufacturing, deepening value addition and supporting targets in reducing carbon footprint.Relevant amendments under the Customs law have been made to provide increased time limits for re-imports and re-exports to enhance competitiveness of the fledgling MRO sector. The government has extended significant duty reduction and exemption benefits to the healthcare and electronics sectors, continuing the impetus of incentives provided under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme.Since their introduction in March 2020, the PLI schemes have indeed supported in revitalizing the manufacturing sector and strengthening the necessary supply chains. The success achieved in the mobile manufacturing sector has now enabled the Government to reduce customs duties on mobile phones and components, signalling a mature environment. The Budget proposals aim at reproducing similar outcomes for semiconductor and pharmaceutical industry by increasing the budgetary allocation.Buoyed by the increasing revenue collection under GST signalling a shift towards a mature tax regime, this Budget has harmonized the timeframes for the issuance of demand notices and adjudication orders for cases involving fraud, suppression or otherwise. Significant amendments to the GST legislations have been introduced reflecting the recommendations proposed by the GST Council such as regularizing non-levy of GST due to general practice which may turn out to be a breather for certain impacted industries reeling under huge tax demands.The Insurance sector has been provided much relief through the GST council recommendations which have been cemented in the present budget thereby ending long standing disputes on their business practices.The Government's efforts to push forward with its reform agenda are evident as plans to incentivize states for their business reform actions plans and digitalization through the Jan Vishwas Bill 2.0 is proposed. Further, setting up of e-commerce export hubs is envisaged to facilitate easier access to international markets for domestic players.The recent implementation of Budget proposals allows the government to maintain momentum in its reform agenda. These policy measures implicitly reaffirm the significance of India Inc as a crucial element in the development of infrastructure. However, there are still some expectations required to be met to march towards a Viksit Bharat 2047.",The Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business.

Budget 2024 : Real estate, a significant contributor to employment generation, has received a fair bit of attention in Budget 2024-25. Recent years have seen the sector transform rapidly, driven by factors such as favourable government policies, Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, strong economic growth and changing consumer preferences.Added to that, the budgetary focus on job creation, skilling and employment-linked incentives, infrastructure, urban development, rural connectivity, digitalisation and land-related norms, all dovetail to promote growth of the sector.Launched in June 2015, the PMAY aims to provide affordable housing to all eligible beneficiaries. The budget unveiled PMAY Urban 2.0, under which the housing needs of 1 crore urban poor and middle class will be addressed with an investment of Rs 10 lakh crore.The central government’s additional Rs 2.2 lakh crore injection in the next 5 years to make housing more affordable has the potential to revitalise the affordable housing market.Such an approach can play an important role in realising the government's vision of Housing for All and push growth and development. Hence, the significant investment under PMAY Urban 2.0 is expected to alleviate urban housing deficits, spurring construction and economic growth.Steps to introduce technological reforms within the regulatory framework for land, such as digitalisation or GIS mapping of land records, will improve transparency.Rationalisation of stamp duty across states will also be critical to bring in uniformity and initiate land-related reforms such as urban planning, usage and building bylaws.These are steps in the right direction and will boost growth. Moreover, they will improve the ease of property transactions and strengthen municipal finances through increased property taxes. Rationalization of stamp duty with an emphasis on women homebuyers may boost home-buyer sentiment in major cities, too.The budget has also given ample attention to urban and rural development, with rental housing for industrial workers through the public private partnership model, interest subsidies for rental housing, and transit-oriented developments.The proposal to develop investment-ready plug-and-play industrial parks in 100 cities may attract industrial investment, leading to increased demand for industrial real estate and support the growth of ancillary services and residential developments in these regions.Initiatives for industrial parks and rental housing for industrial workers align with the country’s manufacturing goals and addresses worker accommodation needs.These steps are expected to promote industrial growth and stability in labour-intensive sectors, while also creating new opportunities for real estate developers specialising in rental and affordable housing.The changes in long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax, however, have evoked a mixed reaction. The government lowered the long-term capital gains tax from 20% to 12.5%, which is a welcome step. However, this came with the removal of the indexation benefit.The changes could encourage more liquidity in property transactions and potentially increase the effective tax burden depending on the property’s acquisition date.The launch of Phase IV of the PM Gram Sadak Yojana in 25,000 rural habitations will improve connectivity in rural areas, promoting rural development and making these regions more accessible for investment. The primary objective of PMGSY is to build robust, all-weather roads in rural habitations. This initiative focuses on enhancing connectivity and supporting economic development in rural areas.In essence, the budget is geared towards stimulating growth and investment in the real estate sector , fostering a more transparent and investor-friendly environment, and contributing to overall development. It aims to create a balanced and inclusive growth environment by addressing the needs of various segments, including affordable housing, industrial workers and urban infrastructure.The effectiveness of the initiatives, however, hinges on their implementation and continued support of complementary reforms.","Budget 2024-25 is geared towards stimulating growth and investment in the real estate sector.

New Budget 2024 rule: Why Income Tax Department is likely to issue a huge number of tax notices this month,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-budget-2024-rule-why-income-tax-department-is-likely-to-issue-a-huge-number-of-tax-notices-this-month/articleshow/112186079.cms,"Taxing Times

Income Tax Notice on the way? The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month, as there are concerns that many taxpayers might escape the tax net due to the impending implementation of the new reassessment law on September 1, 2024.According to the amended regulation announced in Budget 2024 , the tax authorities can only go back a maximum of five years to reassess a taxpayer's records if the escaped income is at least Rs 50 lakh, and three years for an amount less than Rs 50 lakh.Previously, they could reassess cases up to 10 years old.According to an ET report, tax officials are now faced with the challenge of compiling and corroborating data on tax and income mismatches for the financial years 2013-14 to 2017-18 within the next few weeks, as these years will become time-barred for reassessment from September 1, 2024.The I-T department relies on information from various sources, such as banks, property registrars, and search findings from the investigation wing, to build reassessment cases.A tax officers' body has raised concerns about the feasibility of issuing notices under Section 148 (or 148A) in a large number of cases within a single month, given the overburdened nature of the jurisdictional assessing officers and the time-consuming process of obtaining sanction from the chief commissioner, who is the specified authority for such notices.Moreover, the law provides taxpayers with the right to explain their position before reassessment orders are finalized, a process that most believe cannot be completed by the end of August.Also Read | ITR refund status for FY 2023-24: How to check income tax refund status online - here’s a step-by-step guide for incometax.gov.in & NSDL websites The Central Board of Direct Taxes ( CBDT ) has been urged by its officers to postpone the effective date of the proposed amendment. However, this suggestion is unlikely to be well-received by corporations and high net worth individuals.""Capping the reassessment period at five years was a great decision as it would reduce hassles and litigation. But if the department fears there could be a genuine loss of revenue as it may not be possible to wrap up several matters by August 31, the government can think of strict parameters where time-bound cases can be selectively reopened - based on trails of steps taken in identifying escaped income,"" said Mitil Chokshi, partner at CA firm Chokshi & Chokshi.""Taxpayers may expect a rush of reassessment notices in August 2024. These notices are likely to be for the AYs 2018-19 and prior to that. It is pertinent to note that the Bombay High Court in a recent ruling in a case of Hexaware Technologies has taken a view on a proviso introduced in 2021, which can be interpreted to mean that AY 2017-18 (and prior years) got time barred on March 31, 2024. These reassessment notices (for AYs 2017-18 and prior) are likely to rake up new interpretation issues in the already muddled reassessment provisions,"" said Ashish Mehta, partner at law firm Khaitan & Co.The current situation is similar to the conflict between the Income Tax office and taxpayers in 2021. The reassessment law was amended in April 2021, allowing the tax office to reopen 10-year-old tax returns if the total undisclosed income exceeded Rs 50 lakh and reassess 4-year-old matters if the amount was less than Rs 50 lakh.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? However, this change led to over 10,000 writ petitions being filed by companies, arguing that they were not given sufficient time to explain and that the notices were issued without considering the carve-out that cases which couldn't be reopened earlier couldn't be reassessed under the new law.The Supreme Court invoked its extraordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution on May 4, 2022, to uphold all reassessment notices issued after March 31, 2021. However, the court left room for judicial proceedings based on the merits of each case, and several such matters are currently pending before the court.","The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month.

Latest NPS rules, news: In the Union Budget 2024 speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced two new initiatives with regard to National Pension Scheme (NPS) - extension of NPS 14% employer contribution benefits to private setcor and the intended launch of NPS Vatsalya.Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries, bringing it at par with the provisions available for government employees.Sriram Iyer, CEO, HDFC Pension Management told ET that with this move the “ground rules have been harmonised among government and non-government employees, which is a positive step.”Effectively, this means that now, private-sector employees can choose to reduce the taxable portion of employers’ contribution to their NPS corpus, thereby paying less tax and leaving greater funds in their pension deposits.“Employees will benefit from tax savings . More importantly, the 40% increase in contribution will have a significant impact on the terminal value of the retirement corpus,” remarked Iyer. The extended savings will “help in retirement planning, working as an option that is at par with the Provident Fund,” Dinesh Rohira, CEO & Founder, 5nance.com was quoted as saying.Moreover, the endeavour aims to increase NPS penetration by increasing tax incentives for the private sector, providing them a social security-cushion post-retirement.The scheme’s motive to widen the NPS subscriber base may not prove to be flawlessly effective, however. This is explained by Agrees Mrin Agarwal, Founder, Finsafe India: “While it’s good that the limit has been raised, it may not increase adoption as employees need to be educated in a big way. Also, the benefit is only for the salaried opting for the new tax regime,” she says.The mandatory contribution to the EPF, too, threatens to relegate the provisions of NPS under the umbrella of near-superfluity. This sentiment is echoed by Varun Sahay, a software engineer in a Delhi-based IT company: “When 12% of my salary is already deducted for the EPF, why should I put in more in the NPS and cut my take-home pay?”Rohira feels otherwise. “There’s no competition between the NPS and EPF as employees can contribute to both and build a 3-4 times bigger corpus while earning 3-4% higher returns via marketlinked options in the NPS,” he counters.Also Check | New Tax Regime 2023 vs 2024 After Budget: How Much Income Tax Will Salaried Taxpayers Save & How Do New Tax Slabs Compare To Old Regime? Top 10 Points You Must Know To jumpstart retirement savings for children, a new initiative called NPS Vatsalya has been unveiled in the Budget. This scheme allows parents and guardians to contribute to a minor's account, which can be converted into a regular NPS account once the child reaches adulthood.""It provides a very long duration for reaping the compounding benefits and accumulating a huge bounty at a later age. This can be a good way to plan a better future for kids who may not opt for a service segment in the future,"" says Rohira. Sriram Iyer agrees, stating, ""It’s a good move to help the child start his retirement journey. Even if a parent starts when the child is 10 years old, by the time he starts working, it can be a solid foundation for the compounding journey after that.""However, some experts question the utility of a product with such a long lock-in period, especially when parents cannot use the funds for essential goals like their child’s education amidst soaring education costs of 11-12%.""Parents are struggling to save for their own retirement, so it might be a bit of a stretch to expect them to save for their kids’ retirement. The need of the hour is a market-linked product that allows withdrawals only for the child’s education,"" says Mrin Agarwal, Founder of Finsafe India.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? Though the NPS permits partial withdrawals, it allows only 25% of the corpus after three years of joining, and this can be done only three times during the entire tenure. A premature exit before 60 years with 100% withdrawal is only possible if the corpus is less than Rs.2.5 lakh, an amount insufficient for most children's goals.""In its current form, there won’t be any uptake,"" asserts Agarwal. Rohira concurs, ""It’s a vanilla product with a lock-in, which does not make it very attractive and it may not take off. However, the government may optimise it and introduce new features later."" Iyer adds, ""This is just a start and there may be more subscriber-friendly features as we take it to the market. The regulator is proactive and open to feedback.""","Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries.

Gold import duty cut: Why Indians may not find buying gold from Dubai as attractive post Budget 2024,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-import-duty-cut-why-indians-may-not-find-buying-gold-from-dubai-as-attractive-post-budget-2024/articleshow/112097671.cms,"Gold import duty cut in Budget 2024: The recent reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai. Indian jewellers with stores in both India and the UAE believe that the narrowed duty differential will result in lower gold prices in India, making it less attractive for Indians to purchase gold in Dubai.The emirate had attracted gold-enthusiast Indians following a steep rise in customs duty in India in July 2022. In the fiscal 2024-25 budget, the duty on gold imports was more than halved.The duty cut is also expected to boost gold jewellery production in India, particularly the popular 'Kolkatti' jewellery from Kolkata, which is favored by Indian expats in Dubai and tourists from various countries. This move will encourage gold artisans to create new designs in both heavyweight and lightweight jewellery, attracting consumers to purchase gold from India.According to an ET report, Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group , estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India as Indian tourists who previously bought jewellery in Dubai will now prefer to shop in India. However, Indian expats living in Dubai and other customers may continue to buy from the UAE.Also Read | Gold losing sheen? Government cuts gold bond issuance target as investors look at better alternatives Rajiv Popley, director at Popley & Sons, believes that the perception of overseas gold being cheaper than in India is merely a mindset. He points out that the labour cost is significantly lower in India, and with the introduction of mandatory hallmarking and HUID numbers, the purity of gold in India is no longer a concern.Furthermore, NRIs in Dubai do not receive VAT refunds, and Indians travelling abroad only receive about 60% of the VAT back on their gold purchases. Gold trade analyst Bhargav Baidya suggests that the 1% duty differential between gold jewellery in India and Dubai will be offset by Indian jewellers offering discounts to retain and attract customers.Saurabh Gadgil, chairman of PNG Jewellers, notes that Indian import duty is now on par with the US, allowing Indian jewellers to offer competitive prices compared to other countries worldwide. The reduced customs duty is expected to make gold purchases in India more attractive and convenient for Indian consumers, potentially leading to a significant shift in their gold shopping preferences.",The reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai.

Gold losing sheen? The government has reduced its target for issuing gold bonds in the financial year 2024-25 by 38% compared to the previous interim budget goal, according to a senior official. The revised target stands at Rs 18,500 crore, down from Rs 29,638 crore estimated in the interim budget and Rs 26,852 crore (revised estimate) in 2023-24.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told ET ""The decision followed a reassessment of various factors, including investor demand, other investment products and uncertainties around the global economy, as the situation has changed since the interim budget in February.""After accounting for redemptions, the net issuances of sovereign gold bonds are now estimated at Rs 15,000 crore for this fiscal year, a significant decrease from the Rs 26,138 crore projected in the interim budget and Rs 25,352 crore in the revised estimate for 2023-24.Harish Galipelli, director at ILA Commodities India, attributed this shift to retail investors increasingly opting for equities in anticipation of better returns. He also noted that people are uncertain about the potential for further increases in gold prices in the short-to-medium term following a recent rally. Additionally, Galipelli pointed out that savings in rural areas have been impacted by retail inflation and other factors.The gold bond and gold monetisation schemes were introduced by the government in late 2015 to discourage the physical purchase of precious metals and reduce imports, thereby mitigating the negative impact on the current account deficit.The gross collection through these two schemes is now projected to be Rs 20,030 crore in 2024-25, compared to Rs 31,168 crore in the interim budget and Rs 28,240 crore (revised estimate) in the previous fiscal year. Similarly, the net collection is estimated at Rs 16,433 crore, down from Rs 27,571 crore in the interim budget and Rs 26,653 crore in the previous year. However, the estimates for the gold monetisation scheme remain unchanged from the interim budget level.Also Read | Budget 2024: Duty cuts on gold, silver, platinum, and diamonds to make jewellery more affordable The sovereign gold bond scheme targets investors who view gold as an investment, encouraging them to purchase paper gold instead of physical gold.On the other hand, the gold monetisation scheme aims to bring out idle gold held by households, temple trusts, and others to increase domestic supply. Both schemes were designed to curb gold imports, which, along with crude oil, have been significant contributors to India's current account deficit.

"Bhavish Aggarwal, one of world’s youngest billionaires, to double fortune on Ola IPO",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/bhavish-aggarwal-one-of-worlds-youngest-billionaires-to-double-fortune-on-ola-ipo/articleshow/112390274.cms,"Taking on Tesla

Just two years ago, Bhavish Aggarwal was facing one of his biggest tests. A video on social media showed an Ola Electric Mobility Ltd . vehicle bursting into flames in the Indian city of Pune, raising doubts about whether his bet on the world’s biggest e-scooter factory would ultimately pay off.The outspoken founder, who’s drawn parallels to Elon Musk , bounced back.Now, the company’s public listing is set to cement his position as one of the world’s youngest billionaires.Aggarwal, 38, will add $1.2 billion to his wealth if his SoftBank Group Corp-backed Ola Electric lists Friday in Mumbai at the lowest end of the price band at 72 rupees ($0.86) a share, giving the entrepreneur a net worth of $2.3 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Ola Electric did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Aggarwal’s net worth.Despite being yet to turn a profit since it was founded in Bengaluru in 2017, Ola Electric is among the many electric vehicle-linked firms looking at India’s public market to raise money, tapping into the craze for alternative fuels in one of the busiest countries for new share offerings. The firm made a net loss of 14.7 billion rupees in the financial year ended March 2023, its offer document shows.“Three years ago when we launched our product, I believe that’s when the EV story began,” Aggarwal said at a press conference in Mumbai in late July.Just two years after its founding and without having shipped a single scooter, Ola Electric had become a unicorn — a startup with a $1 billion valuation — thanks to early funding from the likes of SoftBank and Tiger Global Management. At a time when India’s green infrastructure was in its nascency, Aggarwal aimed to build the world’s leading “urban mobility EV company,” he told Bloomberg News in 2021.But the company encountered some early stumbles. Shortly after it debuted its electric two-wheelers in 2021, it saw a major setback when Ola scooters were caught up in a spate of high-profile EV battery fires across the country.The company recalled more than 1,400 scooters in the wake of the incidents.A serial entrepreneur, Aggarwal has started companies operating in a range of industries from online payments to artificial intelligence.Even before the listing of his electric-vehicle company, Aggarwal had joined an exclusive club. Bloomberg’s wealth index of the world’s top 500 billionaires lists only seven under the age of 40 across the world, excluding Meta Platforms Inc. founders Mark Zuckerberg and Dustin Moskovitz both of whom turned 40 in May.Aggarwal in many ways embodies Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s more confident and assertive India. Never one to shy away from offering an opinion, Aggarwal appeared to welcome Tesla Inc.’s decision last month not to invest in India, saying in a post on X, “this is Tesla’s loss, not India’s.”He seems to relish competing with global giants such as Musk’s EV venture on his home turf. As he put it in an interview with Bloomberg last year: “Tesla is for the West, Ola is for the rest.”After graduating from one of India’s top technology-focused schools, the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, Aggarwal started out working at Microsoft Research India before founding his first company in 2010. Ola Cabs, or ANI Technologies Pvt, was launched as a ride-hailing app to rival Uber Technologies Inc. and soon expanded beyond cab services into online payments and food-delivery.He founded his latest venture, Krutrim, in 2023, which became India’s first $1 billion AI startup in January this year. Through Krutrim, he plans on building large language models, data centers, and ultimately servers and super computers for the AI ecosystem.All of his firms are in tech-led sectors, creating data that can be used by his other businesses, said Nitin Pangarkar, associate professor of strategy and policy at the National University of Singapore. “But the attention given to the businesses could be an issue.”He owns stake in Ola Cabs and Krutrim, and has also invested undisclosed amounts in tea chain Chaayos and news platform YourStory among others as an angel investor, according to data from Tracxn Technologies Ltd.He is a vocal supporter of Modi’s aim to boost local manufacturing, and often takes to social media as well as blogs to talk about how his firms can contribute to India’s economic growth.In May, he ditched Microsoft Azure’s cloud services for his firm’s and moved to Krutrim cloud after a LinkedIn chatbot used gender neutral pronouns with him. Criticizing Microsoft for “pronoun illness” on his X account, he said Indians need to move away from western concepts of diversity, equity and inclusion and set their own guidelines.“He’s like India’s Elon Musk,” said Pangarkar. “Brash and abrasive and all that. But that hasn’t stopped Musk from succeeding.”","Bhavish Aggarwal, 38, will add $1.2 billion to his wealth if his Ola Electric lists Friday in Mumbai at the lowest end of the price band at 72 rupees ($0.86) a share.

RIYADH: Saudi oil giant Aramco on Tuesday reported net profit of $29.07 billion in the second quarter, a slight drop from the same period last year as output remained subdued.The decrease of 3.4 percent ""mainly reflects the impact of lower crude oil volumes sold and weakening refining margins"", the company said in a statement posted to the Saudi stock exchange.Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest crude exporter, is currently producing roughly nine million barrels per day (bpd), well below its capacity of 12 million bpd.Production averaged 8.8 million bpd in June, Riyadh-based firm Jadwa Investment said last week.The relatively low figure reflects cuts dating back to October 2022, when the OPEC+ bloc of oil producers that Riyadh co-leads with Moscow announced it would reduce output by two million bpd to boost prices.In April 2023, several OPEC+ members announced they would further slash production by more than one million bpd, and in June 2023, Riyadh announced an additional voluntary cut of one million bpd.""Output will remain at similar levels until at least October"", at which point an OPEC+ agreement announced in June 2024 will allow ""for gradual monthly increases"", Jadwa said.Aramco is the jewel of the Saudi economy and the main source of revenue for Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's Vision 2030 reform agenda, which aims to set the Gulf kingdom up for a prosperous post-oil future.The firm's profits help allow Saudi Arabia to finance flagship projects including NEOM, the futuristic mega-city being built in the desert, a giant airport in Riyadh and major tourism and leisure developments.The IMF said in April that, at current production levels, Saudi Arabia's fiscal break-even oil price would be $96.2 per barrel in 2024.Brent, the international benchmark, was trading at $76.43 per barrel on Tuesday after Monday's global stock market rout fuelled by US recession fears.Yet Aramco chief executive Amin Nasser told reporters that Aramco was still ""positive about the outlook for global oil demand"", pointing to ""strong"" demand from China.""The market in my view is overreacting and the fundamentals do not support the drop in prices that we are witnessing today,"" Nasser said.""I think the market is reading too much into the short-term responses to the news coming from the US with regards to the number of jobs.""The government's stake in Aramco, one of the world's biggest companies by market capitalisation, is around 81.5 percent.Aramco's initial public offering in 2019, the biggest flotation in history, raised $29.4 billion, and a secondary offering this year of nearly 1.7 billion shares fetched $12.35 billion.Aramco announced last year it would start paying a performance-based dividend in addition to its base dividend.In May, the firm announced base dividend payouts for the first quarter totalling $20.3 billion and a performance-linked dividend distribution of $10.8 billion to be paid in the second quarter.Those payments will be extended for another quarter and Aramco ""expects to declare industry-leading dividends of $124.2 billion in 2024"", Tuesday's statement said.""We have delivered market-leading performance once again, with strong earnings and cash flows in the first half of the year,"" Nasser said.""Leveraging those strong earnings, we continued to deliver a base dividend that is sustainable and progressive.""Aramco reported record profits in 2022 after Russia's invasion of Ukraine sent oil prices soaring, allowing Saudi Arabia to record its first budget surplus in nearly a decade.But the cash cow saw its profits drop by a quarter last year because of lower oil prices and production cuts, and profits in the first quarter of this year were down 14.5 percent.In January, Aramco said it had been instructed to abandon a plan to increase production capacity to 13 million barrels per day, up from its current level of 12 million bpd.Analysts said the surprise announcement could reflect a lack of confidence in demand, although Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said it was motivated by the transition to cleaner fuels.Saudi Arabia has pledged to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2060, a statement that has drawn intense scepticism from environmental activists.Aramco has vowed to achieve ""operational net-zero"" carbon emissions by 2050, which does not include the emissions from customers burning its products.Nasser told reporters on Tuesday that oil and gas demand ""will not peak any time soon given the vital role that hydrocarbons continue to play in the global economy"".","Saudi oil giant Aramco on Tuesday reported net profit of $29.07 billion in the second quarter.

Japan’s equity benchmarks slid more than 20% from record highs reached last month as investor confidence crumbled from the surge in the yen, tighter monetary policy and the deteriorating economic outlook in the US.The Topix and Nikkei 225 Stock Average tumbled more than 7%, with both set for three-day declines that would be the worst since the 2011 Fukushima nuclear meltdown and push them into bear markets.Circuit breakers suspended trading of futures for both equity benchmarks.Exporters were among the heaviest drags on the Topix after the yen surged more than 2% versus the dollar on the unwinding of carry trades, while banks dropped after yields of 10-year government bonds plunged 13 basis points.“We are basically seeing a mass deleveraging as investors sell assets to fund their losses,” said Kyle Rodda, a senior market analyst at Capital.Com. “The rapidity of the move has caught me off guard; there’s a lot of panic selling now, which is what causes these non-linear reactions in asset prices to pretty straightforward fundamental dynamics.”All 33 of the Topix’s industry groups have fallen since the Bank of Japan raised interest rates on July 31, triggering a surge in the yen that has cast a pall over the earnings outlook for exporters. Yen-funded carry trades were among the most popular in emerging markets as volatility remained low and investors bet Japanese rates would remain at rock bottom.Even insurers and banks that were expected to benefit from higher rates are now some of the biggest losers since the BOJ’s hike as global equity markets slump. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group shares fell as much as 21%, their biggest intraday decline on record, as yields plunged globally following poor US data.“Many people long the weak JPY trades and soft landing scenario are being forced to unwind,” said Rafael Nemet-Nejat a senior portfolio manager at Jin Investment Management Pte. “The moves are extreme especially in crowded longs even if earnings are huge beats, likely indicating that funds are either blowing up and/or experiencing a lot of pain.’Signs of weakness in the US economy sparked a slump on Wall Street on Friday and a plunge in Treasury yields. Nonfarm payrolls rose by 114,000 — one of the weakest prints since the pandemic — and job growth was revised lower in the prior two months. The unemployment rate unexpectedly climbed for a fourth month to 4.3%, triggering a closely watched recession indicator.Once the main drivers of the market’s ascent, foreign investors sold net ¥1.56 trillion ($10.7 billion) Japanese cash equities and futures combined in the week that ended July 26, according to data from Japan Exchange Group Inc.“The latest big selloff in equities, reinforced by US market’s downturn and led by technology stocks, has staged a big reset in terms of expectations for Japan equity returns for the rest of the year,” Andrew Jackson, head of Japan equity strategy at Ortus Advisors Pte in Singapore, wrote in a note.“Although the market is currently in a ‘storm,’ Japanese stocks will gradually find a place to settle down along with the U.S. stock market,” she said. “Selling is being spurred by the unwinding of long positions and the involvement of trend-following hedge funds. Valuation and fundamental strategies are not applicable in some areas due to the panic selling aspect of the market.”“It is too early to tell if the summer heat will abate. But it is certainly a case of a conspiracy of ‘risk off’ triggers. The BOJ from what it did (hike and signal more) and the Fed for it has not (cut and commit to emphatic cutting) are conspiring to undermine precariously rich markets.”“There is a general pattern of a reversal from the previous year’s data and the BOJ is not likely to raise interest rates further and will likely not be possible looking at the pace of the stock prices.”“Until the bottoming out of USD/JPY is confirmed, aggressive buying of Japanese equities is likely to be restrained. At the moment, the US economic surprise index is showing a worsening trend, and investors are becoming increasingly wary of deteriorating US economic indicators.”",Japan’s equity benchmarks slid more than 20% from record highs reached last month.
