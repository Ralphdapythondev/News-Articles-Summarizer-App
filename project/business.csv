Godrej family seals deal to split group’s assets,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/godrej-family-seals-deal-to-split-groups-assets/articleshow/109738329.cms,"MUMBAI: The Godrejs have reached a settlement to split the Rs 59,000-crore ($7 billion) locks-to-land development group to “better align ownership in acknowledgement of the differing visions of the family members”.While Adi Godrej and his brother Nadir Godrej will gain complete ownership over the five listed entities of the Godrej Group — Godrej Consumer Products, Godrej Properties, Godrej Industries , Godrej Agrovet and Astec Lifesciences — Jamshyd and his sister Smita will fully control the closely- held Godrej & Boyce.Adi and Nadir, together with their children, have been managing the five entities, while Jamshyd, his sister Smita and their families have been leading Godrej & Boyce, which is into appliances, aerospace, locking solutions and construction.Their other cousin Rishad, who too owns a stake in the Godrej companies, however, has no formal role in the conglomerate. Their grandfather, along with his brother, had established the Godrej Group 127 years ago.The two branches have held shares across the group and sat on each other’s companies’ boards. But now, they’ll transfer their equity interests after having stepped down from the boards to facilitate a clean separation.Adi and Nadir will divest their shares in Godrej & Boyce to Jamshyd and Smita, while Smita and Jamshyd will transfer their shares in Godrej Consumer Products and Godrej Properties to Adi and Nadir. Rishad, who is a bachelor, will reportedly distribute his assets equally among the other family members upon his death. He couldn’t be contacted for immediate comments. Both sides will continue to use the Godrej brand for their respective businesses, according to a late evening statement from the family.Adi, Nadir, Jamshyd, Smita and Rishad own around 10% each in Godrej & Boyce, while about 24% is held by Pirojsha Godrej Foundation — a philanthropic trust created by the family — and 27% by Godrej Investments. The five listed companies have a market capitalisation of Rs 2.4 lakh crore ($29 billion), revenues of over Rs 41,750 crore ($5 billion) and profit of Rs 4,175 crore ($500 million). Godrej & Boyce has a revenue of nearly $2 billion and a pre-tax profit of $72 million.“The shareholding realignment in Godrej companies has been arrived at in a respectful and mindful way to maintain harmony,” the statement said. The realignment will be implemented after the relevant regulatory approvals have been obtained.Godrej & Boyce and its affiliates will now be controlled by Jamshyd, Smita’s daughter Nyrika Holkar, and their immediate families. Godrej Industries and the other four listed companies will be controlled by Adi, Nadir and their immediate families.Adi’s son Pirojsha will be the executive vice chairperson of GIG (Godrej Industries Group) and will succeed Nadir Godrej as chairperson in August 2026, the statement added. It remains to be seen how the group’s real estate assets worth over Rs 3,000 crore, held under Godrej & Boyce, will be split between the two sides. Godrej Properties has been developing some of the Godrej & Boyce land. The split comes even as the fourth generation of the family has been deeply involved in the affairs of the conglomerate.Commenting on the future outlook, Jamshyd Godrej said: “Since 1897, Godrej & Boyce has always been driven by the strong purpose of nation building. With this future-facing family agreement now in place, we can further drive our growth aspirations with fewer complexities and focus on leveraging our core strengths in high tech engineering and design-led innovation across our strong portfolio of strategic, consumer and emerging businesses.”Nadir Godrej said, “Godrej was founded in 1897 to help build economic independence for India. This deep purpose of innovating for a cause - the values of trust and respect and the belief in trusteeship and making communities that the companies operate in stronger and better - continue to form the bedrock of who we are 125 years later. We look forward to building on this legacy with focus and agility.” “The Godrej family settlement was ‘locked’ today with the elegance and dignity that the family is known for. No controversies, just all clean like their soaps,” said a post from RPG Group’s Harsh Goenka on X.","The Godrejs have reached a settlement to split the Rs 59,000-crore ($7 billion) locks-to-land development group. Jamshyd and his sister Smita will fully control the closely- held Godrej & Boyce.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109738332,imgsize-829912,width-400,resizemode-4/109738332.jpg"

When will gold prices hit Rs 2 lakh mark? Here’s what experts say,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/investing/when-will-gold-prices-hit-rs-2-lakh-mark-heres-what-experts-say/articleshow/109750709.cms,"Gold Prices Outlook:

Gold prices: What should investors do?

Gold has been a cherished asset for Indian households, consistently delivering impressive returns compared to other investment options. Even as gold prices touch new highs this year, one wonders when the yellow metal will hit levels of Rs 1 lakh, or even Rs 2 lakh? What does historical data on the movement of gold suggest and what should investors do?Gold prices have nearly tripled over the past 9 years, rising from Rs 24,740 in 2015.This follows a similar pattern observed in the previous 9-year period, when the price tripled from Rs 8,250 in 2006. Going back further, it took approximately 19 years for the gold price to triple from Rs 2,570 per 10 g in 1987, preceded by tripling cycles of around 8 years and 6 years, states an ET report by Naveen Kumar.If the price continues to triple from its current level, gold could surpass the Rs 2 lakh per 10 gram mark. However, investors are keen to know how long it will take for the price to reach this milestone. Here is what experts have to say on future returns and timeline for gold to hit the Rs 2 lakh level:Gold prices are sensitive to global events, such as geopolitical tensions and economic crises, which can cause rapid increases in relatively short periods. In the past 5 years, factors like rupee weakness, geopolitical issues, the pandemic, and war have contributed to a 75% increase in gold prices, from Rs 40,000 to over Rs 7,00,000, in just 3.3 years. In contrast, from 2014 to 2018, gold prices only increased by 12%, from Rs 28,000 to Rs 31,250.Also Read | Important updates for NPS subscribers: New charges and security measures announced by PFRDA Jateen Trivedi, VP Research Analyst at LKP Securities, states, ""Historical data shows that major global changes, such as geopolitical tensions and economic crises, can significantly influence gold prices, leading to rapid increases within relatively short periods. The recent past of 5 years has shown rupee weakness as well as geopolitical issues and pandemic and war. All these together have given gold a spurt from Rs 40,000 to Rs 7,00,00+ — a gain of 75% in a matter of 3.3 years. In 2014, gold price was Rs 28,000 and in 2018 it was Rs 31,250, which is only 12% in a matter of 5 years.""Trivedi also suggests that gold prices could potentially reach Rs 2 lakh within the next 7-12 years, given recent trends.Some experts, like Surendra Mehta, National Secretary of the India Bullion and Jewellers Association, are even more optimistic about gold prices tripling and crossing Rs 2 lakh. Mehta believes that escalating geopolitical tensions between Iran and Israel after Ramzan, as well as China-Taiwan tensions, could bring uncertainty and lead to de-dollarisation. He predicts that these factors, along with heavy paper trading of gold in SGE and Comex, could cause gold prices to triple within the next 6 years.However, it's important to note that the tripling period for gold prices can vary significantly. Vikram Dhawan, Fund Manager and Head - Commodities at Nippon India Mutual Fund, points out that there has been an instance where the tripling period extended to almost 19 years. Dhawan reminds us that gold, like any other asset, is subject to bull and bear markets, leading to variable annual returns.He states, ""Like any other asset, gold is subject to bull and bear markets, leading to variable annual returns. However, as long as there is no better alternative, gold will continue to be in great demand from consumers and investors alike, hopefully rising to meet their return expectations.""Also Read | New mutual fund KYC rules: Is your KYC validated, verified, registered or on hold? Find out Gold is widely regarded as one of the most effective hedges against inflation. According to Harsh Gahlaut, Co-founder and CEO of FinEdge, ""Gold price is directly correlated to inflation. Inflation has been high across geographies and will take time to cool off. As long as inflation remains high, gold prices will continue to get support and see an upward trend in the future.""The trajectory of inflation will also play a crucial role in determining the pace at which gold prices increase. Hareesh V, Head of Commodities at Geojit Financial Services, explains, ""Inflation and gold prices often have a complex relationship. Gold is often seen as a hedge against inflation because its value tends to hold relatively steady or even increase during times of inflation.""In addition to inflation, various other factors also contribute to the fluctuations in gold prices. Dhawan elaborates, ""When inflation rates rise, the purchasing power of fiat currencies decreases, leading investors to turn to gold as a store of value, thus driving up its price. This relationship is complex and not always direct, as other economic factors can also impact gold prices during periods of high inflation.""The availability of gold has remained consistent, and any sudden increase in demand has the potential to drive prices higher in the short term. ""The total supply of gold is limited, which is the one reason the metal is considered a valuable asset. The supply of gold comes from two main sources — mining and recycling. The amount of new gold mined each year is relatively stable. The rest of the demand is usually met by recycling scrap gold,"" says Hareesh.The growing demand from central banks is expected to persist and may contribute to rising prices. ""There has been large-scale buying from some large central banks as they are considerably increasing their gold holdings — like Russia, China, India, etc. Since the supply of gold is limited, this increase in sovereign treasury holdings will continue to put pressure on supply and will support gold prices. We do not see the supply-side pressure easing in the near future as the risk of geopolitical conflicts does not seem to be easing,"" says Gahlaut.Also Read | Using a credit card? From usage beyond limit to overlimit fees - top queries answered based on RBI’s new FAQs While jewellery has traditionally been a significant driver of demand, it may not continue to play the same role in the future. However, the demand for bullion is anticipated to increase. ""I can see that in a country like India, gold is converting its orbit from consumption item to investment item at a much faster pace. So, sale of jewellery will keep dropping with improved sale of bullion due to financialisation of gold,"" says Mehta.The shifting dynamics of the global landscape may have a lasting effect on the trajectory of gold prices. Dhawan suggests, ""A decline in the credit rating of the US, whether actual or perceived, may propel gold into a multi-decade bull run. Re-globalisation leading to competitive currency devaluations, along with trade disputes, is conducive for gold prices. On the positive side, bigger and wealthier emerging economies that have a cultural affinity towards gold, like India, may lead to a material increase in gold consumption, underpinning the prices.""If the present situations persist or intensify, gold prices are expected to surge even higher. Gahlaut states, ""Any escalation of regional or global conflicts, outright wars breaking out, and dollar domination coming under pressure as a global currency can lead to a spike in gold prices. While returns from gold are not linear, gold will continue to play an important role as a risk reduction tool and as a hedge against inflation.""The implementation of ESG regulations could potentially cause a significant decrease in the supply of gold. Dhawan explains, ""The strict adoption of environmental, social & governance (ESG) rules worldwide is a threat to gold production. This is because gold mines are among the most expensive and most toxic places.""When considering whether to link your investment strategy to the rapid tripling of gold prices, it's essential to approach the decision with caution. ""In conclusion, the trajectory of gold prices will be shaped by a combination of economic indicators, geopolitical events, and market sentiment. While predicting exact price movements is challenging, the fundamental role of gold as a safe-haven asset suggests continued potential for growth in the future,"" says Trivedi.Incorporating gold into your investment portfolio can be a wise choice for diversification purposes. ""Diversifying investments and considering different assets, including gold, can help mitigate risks associated with inflation. During deflationary phases, gold tends to perform well compared to most asset classes,"" says Dhawan.Also Read | Mutual Fund KYC issues: What problems are MF investors facing with new rules and how they can check their KYC status However, it's crucial not to base your entire gold investment strategy solely on the expectation of its tripling potential. ""While it is impossible to predict how long gold will take to triple from the current level, it is important to note that as an asset class, gold plays a critical role as a hedge against inflation, volatility, geopolitical and currency risks and, therefore, will remain an important part of asset allocation in a person's portfolio,"" says Gahlaut.Investing in gold can be beneficial at any time when you are aiming to diversify your investment portfolio. Nevertheless, as the price of gold continues to rise, there may be opportunities to purchase gold during dips in the market. ""Higher prices may eventually lead to reactions from the supply side. However, as gold is under-owned and global gold ETF holdings are at a five-year low, pullbacks may bring in dip buying from investors. Moreover, central banks continue to be net buyers,"" says Dhawan.","Gold prices have nearly tripled over the past 9 years, rising from Rs 24,740 in 2015. If the price continues to triple from its current level, gold could surpass the Rs 2 lakh per 10 gram mark. However, investors are keen to know how long it will take for the price to reach this milestone.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109750744,imgsize-81136,width-400,resizemode-4/109750744.jpg"

In April 2024, the Gross Goods and Services Tax (GST) collections reached an all-time high of Rs 2.10 lakh crore, marking a substantial 12.4% growth compared to the same month in the previous year.

The five KRAs jointly came out with a detailed release as there were cases where investors were not sure if their KYCs, even if done properly, would allow them to continue to invest in stocks, commodities and MFs.The need to reclassify KYCs under various categories arose after it was found that KYCs of many investors were still not updated with PAN and Aadhar, and the linkages were missing.Several of these KYCs were done using documents like utility bills (electricity, telephone), bank account statements etc, which are no longer accepted as valid documents for KYC compliance by Sebi.Effective April 1, under the updated KYC compliance process, KRAs have categorised each investor’s KYC in three categories: validated, registered and on hold. The categorisation was based on availability of PAN, Aadhaar, email and mobile number of the investors, an official from a KRA said.Investors with validated KYCs don’t need to act and can continue their investment process. Those with registered KYCs can also continue their investments but will need to resort to the re-KYC process if they invest in any new fund house or open a new demat account.KYCs that were done using bank statements, utility bills and other similar documents are on hold now and investors with these KYCs can’t invest anymore. They would also not be allowed to withdraw funds unless they update KYC documents.Of nearly 11 crore investors, about 7.9 crore or 73% have valid KYC, a release from the KRAs said.

No cancellation of gilt auction in FY24,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/no-cancellation-of-gilt-auction-in-fy24/articleshow/109766355.cms,"MUMBAI: Strong demand for India’s sovereign bonds and good coordination between govt and RBI ensured that for the first time in nearly 20 years, there was neither devolvement nor any cancellation of bond auctions during FY24. According to bond market players, this could play as a positive kicker for Indian gilts once they are included in bond indices by JP Morgan and Bloomberg , starting next month.The devolvement of an auction happens when, due to lack of interest from buyers of gilts, primary dealers (authorised brokers in govt securities market) are obligated to buy the unsold part of the auction from RBI. The last time this happened was in FY06, RBI said in its recent monetary policy document.In FY24, the absence of devolvement or cancellations came against the backdrop of heightened geopolitical tensions in Europe and West Asia that have led to a spike in crude prices globally. Abnormal volatility in fixed income markets around the world as falling but elevated inflation prompted global central banks to maintain monetary policy restraint have also been a feature.In contrast to volatile global markets, domestic financial markets exhibited orderly movements due to sound macro management by govt and RBI, bond market players said. Quality fiscal management and proactive management of food supply in the economy not only supported growth through investment demand but also helped in containing inflation, along with a relatively stable currency, they added.RBI’s proactive liquidity management, lower-than-expected domestic consumer inflation and the proposed inclusion of Indian govt bonds in JP Morgan and Bloomberg global indices elevated the demand for G-Secs. This has helped the benchmark yield on 10-year papers within a relatively narrow range of 6.95% to 7.35%. In comparison, the yield on US 10-year govt papers fluctuated between 3.3% to 5%.In FY24, the yield on Indian 10-year paper also exhibited a softening bias. Also, there was no devolvement or cancellation of auctions despite record high gross borrowing of around Rs 15.4 lakh crore, RBI data showed. In comparison, in FY23, about Rs 10,000 crore worth of sovereign bonds had devolved while it was nearly Rs 1 lakh crore in FY22 and Rs 1.3 lakh crore in FY21, data from RBI showed.Bond market players expect govt and the central bank to continue to maintain the high quality of coordination during the current fiscal. This is expected to boost growth and come in as a positive factor for foreign and domestic fixed income investors.“Govt’s intention towards credible and sustainable fiscal management with continued thrust on infrastructure and RBI’s vigilance on domestic price stability while ensuring proactive liquidity and exchange rate management are likely to provide strong foundation for sustainable growth over medium term,” said Ram Kamal Samanta, senior VP (investment), Star Union Dai-ichi Life Insurance.","For the first time in nearly 20 years, there was neither devolvement nor any cancellation of bond auctions during FY24. This could play as a positive kicker for Indian gilts once they are included in bond indices by JP Morgan and Bloomberg, starting next month.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109766431,imgsize-1054053,width-400,resizemode-4/109766431.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Yearend sales and better compliance helped goods and services tax (GST) collections soar past the Rs 2-lakh-crore mark for the first time, with experts suggesting that this could be a tipping point for the nearly-seven-year-old indirect tax regime. Based on transactions in March, the latest data released by the finance ministry estimated a 12.4% increase in GST collections , pegged at over Rs 2.1 lakh crore in April, driven largely by domestic demand.The mop-up from domestic transactions was seen to have risen 13.4%, while the figure from imports was up 8.3%. After accounting for refunds, the net GST revenue went up 15.5% to Rs 1,92,000 crore. The numbers buoyed the mood in govt. Post-Covid there has been a consistent rise in collections.Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman tweeted, “GST collection crosses Rs 2 lakh crore benchmark, thanks to the strong momentum in the economy and efficient tax collections . Congratulations to the Central Board of Indirect Taxes & Customs, dept of revenue, all officers at the state and central levels. Their sincere and collaborative efforts have achieved this landmark”.It started with the crackdown on bogus registration and fake invoices along with tightening of norms, with data analytics playing a key role.“These collections could be the tipping point in the GST collection trajectory. While some part of the increased collections are attributable to the financial yearend upswing, it is also reflective of significant improvements in compliance by businesses . The relentless focus on audits by central and state GST authorities together with periodic drives to stamp out evasion has led to this,” said M S Mani, partner at Deloitte India.Among states, Mizoram led the growth charts with a 52% jump in April, while Sikkim (down 5%), Nagaland (3% lower), and Meghalaya and J&K (2% fall) lagged. Among the bigger states, UP recorded a 19% increase, followed by Maharashtra and Gujarat (13% each), Karnataka (9%) and Tamil Nadu (6%).“With the next wave of GST reforms expected after the formation of a new govt, growth may be further accelerated. It may also enable the govt to take bolder decisions, such as rate rationalisation or bringing products such as ATF and natural gas under GST ambit,” said Partik Jain, partner at PwC India.",Yearend sales and better compliance helped goods and services tax (GST) collections soar past the Rs 2-lakh-crore mark for the first time.

The finance minister set the stage for a ""Viksit Bharat by 2047"", on the core principles of ‘Sabka Saath’, ‘Sabka Vikas’, ‘Sabka Vishwas’, with ‘Sabka Prayas’ being added as a new theme in the interim Budget.This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data i.e., farmer welfare and N for Nari utthan i.e., support for women entrepreneurs.These form the pillars of a comprehensive inclusive development. The Government's commitment to sustainable development under the strategy for Amrit Kaal includes achieving 'Net Zero' by 2070, rooftop solarization for one crore households and robust health initiatives.The Indian economy's resilience takes center stage amidst positive indicators of declining current account deficit as a percentage of GDP, falling unemployment rates, and a notable rise in digital transactions. These statistics affirm the robustness of the economy, showcasing a trajectory of growth and stability.The achievements in taxation reforms are nothing short of remarkable, with direct tax collections more than trebling in the last decade, the number of tax return filers increasing by 2.4 times, average processing time of tax returns plummeting from 93 days in FY 2013-14 to an impressive 10 days in FY 2023-24, resulting in issuance of quick refunds. These are the results of consistent progressive measures thus obviating the need for, and rightly avoiding, any last-minute populist measures.No change in existing tax rates, both for direct and indirect taxes, is a good indicator of stability and predictability for investors and taxpayers.A welcome move to waive outstanding tax demands that are minor, disputed, and unreconciled. This involves the withdrawal of outstanding direct tax demands up to Rs. 25,000 pertaining to the period up to FY 2009-10 and up to Rs.10,000 for FY 2010-11 to 2014-15.The Government's commitment to fostering a business-friendly environment is evident in its intent to extend specific tax benefits for start-ups, investments by sovereign wealth funds/ pension funds, and certain IFSC units. The extension has been made now until March 31, 2025. This might help in creating a conducive landscape for business.To align with the CBDT notification issued earlier, the provisions relating to tax collection at source concerning remittances under the Liberalized Remittance Scheme have now been formally incorporated in the Finance Bill, 2024, setting the rate at 20% for amounts exceeding Rs. 7 lakhs in a financial year.The Finance Bill, 2024 proposes an extension of the time limit for introducing the faceless scheme by the Central Government for transfer pricing proceedings, DRP Proceedings, and ITAT Proceedings, up to March 31, 2025.The interim Budget 2024 may not have proposed significant tax announcements, but it very well positioned the prelude to the full budget post the upcoming elections. Considering the potential impact on the population across the four pillars of GYAN, a sizable portion of India stands to be covered. The interim Budget’s focus on the tax front resembles a report card, highlighting the maturity achieved by our tax system. The enhancement of taxpayer services was emphasized as a key priority.","This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data and N for Nari utthan.

Interim Budget for a Viksit Bharat: It’s for everyone and all,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/interim-budget-for-a-viksit-bharat-its-for-everyone-and-all/articleshow/107497439.cms,"By Akhilesh Tuteja

The Finance Minister on February 01, 2024, delivered a truly innovative interim budget. At first glance, it did not seem like an interim budget but looked more like the budget to drive further growth and a continuum of inclusive growth-oriented investments.At the outset, this budget brings a wonderful balance between fiscal prudence and continued investment for growth.It's not easy to continue the glide path of reducing the fiscal deficit and continuing to make significant investments in all areas including infrastructure, R&D, energy transition, technology, skilling, and social welfare. The surprising reduction in fiscal deficit of 5.8% as against the budgeted 5.9% for FY24 and the projection of 5.1% in FY25 with a clear focus on increasing investments was a huge positive.This was a budget for everyone and all because it caters to every part of the Indian economy and society. The FM has carefully catered to the investment needs of various sectors. The continued focus on youth, impoverished, women and farmers to increase their involvement and contribution to economic growth is evident. By committing an 11.1% increase in capital expenditure to 11,11,111 lakh crore, the FM has clearly brought every single 1 in this growth journey.What was very impressive was the inclusion strategy of the government. The focus on women's empowerment for the past few years is unprecedented, which is reflected in the inclusion of women in the workforce moving from 23.3% to 37% in the last five years. The thirty crore Mudra Yojna loans to women entrepreneurs were a great boost to the Nari Shakti initiative. We already have over 10 million Lakhpati Didis and what is truly evident is like a corporate CFO, the FM has revised the earlier target of 20 million Lakhpati Didis to 30 million. The government also plans to invest in initiatives to encourage young girls between the ages of 9 and 14 to undertake the vaccination for cervical cancer which is again a great boost to Nari Shakti.A lot needs to be done to bring more women into all parts of economic growth but the journey so far and the vision of the future is truly inspiring.While India continues on its technological prowess and makes its mark in new technologies like Artificial Intelligence, we need a multi-pronged strategy to harness the power of AI. We need a clear focus on building AI systems in India so that we not only emerge as a global leader in this new era but can build models, which are specific to India that will benefit Indians. At the same time, we need a very wide coverage program to build skills to leverage AI to its fullest potential. The biggest contribution we can make to the inclusion of youth in the economic development of the country is by skilling them in new skill areas. In the last few years, the Skill India Mission has trained 14 million youth, reskilled over 5 million youth and established a staggering 3,000 new ITIs. The future of any country will depend as much on capital investments as on skill investments.The focus on agricultural development and support to the farmer continues through direct financial assistance to farmers. The farmers have benefited by getting crop insurance through PM Fasal Bima Yojana. It's not just the farmers, the PM-SVANidhi provides credit assistance to a large number of street vendors.The last few years have seen the journey of affordable housing through Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY). There is a slight increase in allocation to launch a scheme for encouraging the middle class to build or buy new homes. This investment will likely propel a wider economic development and increase employment.India has seen a tremendous rise in entrepreneurship in the last few years. In order to continue the journey and promote new startups, the government proposes to extend certain tax benefits, which are expiring from March 2024 to March 2025. The MSMEs have not been left behind. With a proposal to provide timely finances to such enterprises, the government has paved the way for their growth, so they can look to compete globally.All in all, it’s a truly inclusive budget with a clear focus on development not just by giving away freebies but enabling the people to participate in the economic development activity. While the FM calls the comprehensive GDP - Governance, Development & Performance – to me, this budget is inclusive of another GDP – gender, demography, and professions.","Akhilesh Tuteja is Partner and Head, Clients and Markets, KPMG in India.

‘Enough domestic sources of demand to counter drag from external sector’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/enough-domestic-sources-of-demand-to-counter-drag-from-external-sector/articleshow/107372012.cms,"Do you think the

creates room for lower interest rates?

One of the issues that the Budget has flagged is the demographic challenge and opportunity and the societal change that is taking place. How do you view this?

Niti Aayog is working on the Viksit Bharat roadmap. What will be the focus areas?

You are as much a representative of the Centre as well as the states. Is it time to revisit the entire formula for transfers to states particularly on the issue of cesses and surcharges?

Suman Bery , who heads Niti Aayog , the govt think tank, is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China, which he says is also an opportunity for India. The economist is confident that Indian states remain resilient. Excerpts of the interview with TOI.The finance ministry expects the economy to grow 7% next year.Given the global situation, how do you see the prospects?The belief in the finance ministry is that we have a possible drag coming from the external sector but that we have other sources. We have enough domestic sources of demand. One has to applaud the political and economic judgment of FM in deciding that it was appropriate to pursue the path of fiscal consolidation. There is transparency. What this actually reflects is responsible economic management, which is one reason we are where we are. Second, it also creates a buffer so that there is policy space if we do encounter headwinds.That’s the hope and expectation. We have an independent central bank and an inflation targeting central bank, so it is up to the monetary policy committee to take a call through the monetary policy committee on the repo rate .The PM has said that when India grows its states grow. India is a composite of 37 states and UTs. They are each at very different points in their demographic transition. There are some states where the net replacement rate is down to 1%, like Kerala . There are others, particularly UP and Bihar, which are in their earliest stage of demographic transition and each one of these states is the size of a large European country. There are two implications of that — one is internal labour mobility and it will become an even larger part of our growth model. The govt has taken several steps to create a unified market. Our main endowment is our human capital and that has to be equipped to participate in global exchange in many ways. We know from China, Japan that the demographic dividend partly depends on markets and on human capital. But the golden period is fairly short lived, about 15 years, when the so called dependency ratio declines. The other big opportunity the PM has been highlighting is bringing women much more into the active labour force.When Niti was set up there was the idea of a three-year vision and a seven-year strategy paper. The reality is that schemes of govt tend to be aligned with the award of the Finance Commission . There are various established building blocks or hand holds which are already a matter of govt policy. The PM is much more interested in a national debate on what it means to be a Viksit Bharat or modern society. We have a collective goal and it is for the democratic polity to define what that goal should be. Its emphatically not for a super mandarin bureaucracy. It is not going to be Lee Kwan Yew’s Singapore led from the top.It’s entirely a finance ministry matter but I would be lying if I didn’t say when I visit certain states there is this complaint. A big frontier would be resource mobilisation at the state level. Second is going to be rationalisation of subsidies not only at the Union level, but also at the state level. All chief ministers sit on my governing council. When they convene as the governing council, I see them in their role as development practitioners. The world is beginning to appreciate quite how much institutional and political maturity India attained in our 75 years and the most fundamental dimension of a democracy, we have orderly transfers of power. There are enough buffers to ensure that what happens in state finances is unlikely to create macro instability. Those risks are well contained by our Constitution. The chief ministers know that they are going to be judged by development outcomes and so you can have the sugar rush of changing of pension plans or various handouts but if the cupboard is bare you are not going to be able to deliver.","Suman Bery is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China.

So is it the idea to keep the Budget completely transparent?

The capex has risen 11.1% and there is an emphasis on infrastructure spending. But there is also the hope that the private sector will now take over and start capital spending. Given the geopolitical situation, how confident is the govt that it will pan out as planned?

Finance secretary T V Somanathan, in an interview with TOI, says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047 . Excerpts:If you see the Budget speech you will see the emphasis on 2047. The govt has set its sight on running that marathon.Running to 2047 is a marathon , it’s not a sprint. If you are going to run a marathon, you need to be in good shape and you can’t have short-term stimulants or something that will get you some yards and then it’s done.The whole focus is on making India a developed country by 2047, for which a healthy present and a strong fiscal position is an important concomitant. Some purely short term measures don’t really fit into that picture. It’s a consistent picture: focus on the long term for which you need to build strength in the short term and that needs to be done by prudence in fiscal policy and by not doing things which can detract you from that path. Not doing the wrong thing is more important than appearing to do things.The idea is that govt finances may be good, bad or indifferent depending on the times, depending on the circumstances, depending on the policies. But what is the position should be reflected as reasonably and accurately as possible. That is an emphasis. As regards the Finance Commission, again the terms of reference that have been given to them are the terms in the Constitution.What is the means by which the devolution should be done is a matter they have full discretion. They can actually take all kinds of factors into account and in a sense we felt this time based on my review of the previous commissions that the right expression would be less is more. The shorter, less prescriptive terms of reference gives full scope for all stakeholders including state govts to express their viewpoints and for the commission to take a balanced view of the different perspectives and then come to its award. Ultimately the award of the Finance Commission is about devolution and grant for which full scope has now been given to them.n There are incipient signs of private capital expenditure accelerating. There are some surveys I have seen done by some of the chambers industry, which show high levels of investment. The PMI, which is a sort of leading indicator, is also looking pretty healthy. Capacity utilisation is one reason that private sector capital expenditure doesn’t immediately pick up when the economy starts accelerating because there is surplus capacity.But increasingly I get the sense that many industries are beginning to reach levels where they have to add capacity. When that happens capital investment will happen. Another pointer also mentioned in the Budget speech you may notice that our airlines have placed large orders for planes — that is capital expenditure.When you import 1,000 aircraft, it’s just not 1,000 aircraft, there are concomitant additions to ground handling facilities, you need airports to expand, you need to employ people to do that. That means a lot of jobs. The aircraft is capital but then look at the effect it is going to have on skilled jobs. So capital expenditure is happening. I am fairly confident that we will have decent capital expenditure in the year to come and that will become a new source of acceleration.",Finance secretary T V Somanathan says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047. The capex has risen 11.1% and there is an emphasis on infrastructure spending.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-107371891,imgsize-720422,width-400,resizemode-4/107371891.jpg"
What is the Section 80C limit for tax deduction for FY 2024-25 after Interim Budget 2024?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/income-tax-budget-2024-2024-2025-section-80c-limit-epf-ppf-elss-nsc/articleshow/107353021.cms,"ALSO READ |

Income Tax Changes Budget 2024 : In the recent Budget 2024 speech, the Finance Minister kept the Section 80C tax deduction limit unchanged. The maximum limit for claiming tax benefits under Section 80C remains at Rs 1.5 lakh for the current fiscal year 2023-24 and will stay the same for individuals looking to save on taxes through Section 80C investments in the upcoming fiscal year 2024-25.Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions. Individuals can reduce their gross taxable income by up to Rs 1.5 lakh per financial year by engaging in these specific investments or expenditures.You can save on taxes through Section 80C by investing in things like Employees' Provident Fund (EPF), Public Provident Fund (PPF), Equity Linked Saving Scheme (ELSS) mutual funds, National Savings Certificate (NSC), and 5-year tax-saving fixed deposits with banks or post offices. Additionally, paying life insurance policy premiums also qualifies for tax benefits under Section 80C.It is important to note that each eligible investment comes with its specific maximum limit, rate of return, liquidity, and taxation rules for the earned returns, states ET in a report. For instance, the most you can invest in PPF in a financial year is Rs 1.5 lakh. Meanwhile, there's no limit on the amount you can invest in ELSS mutual funds, but the Section 80C deduction is capped at Rs 1.5 lakh.If individuals can't make specific investments, they can still get deductions under Section 80C from their gross taxable income through certain expenses. These expenses include repaying the principal amount of a home loan, tuition fees for children, payment of stamp duty, registration fees, and other costs related to buying a house.Since the financial year 2020-21, individuals without any business income must annually choose between the old and new tax regimes. As of the fiscal year 2023-24, the new tax regime is the default option. Consequently, individuals seeking tax deductions under Section 80C must opt for the old tax regime since this deduction isn't available in the new tax regime. It's crucial for taxpayers to be aware of these rules to make informed decisions about their tax planning and investment strategies.","Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget which is an interim budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year. The budget talks about inclusive development both, social and geographical, especially for youth, women, farmers, and the poor. Continued focus on improving logistics through infrastructure spend on roads, rail, airports, ports increases productivity for companies and citizens alike.To make ‘Viksit Bharat’ by 2047, the government’s focus is on improving and empowering people’s capabilities through various skilling initiatives. It is encouraging to see that Skill India Mission has succeeded in training more than 1.4 crore youth and upskilling and reskilling 54 lakh youth. I am particularly happy to see the continued focus on youth and women entrepreneurship and the announcement of a new fund which will give interest free 50 year loans for startups will provide a domestic fillip to startups supplementing venture capital we have traditionally relied on from abroad.PM Mudra Yojana has sanctioned 43 crore loans aggregating to 22.5 lakh crore to youth entrepreneurs and thirty crore Mudra Yojana loans to women entrepreneurs. There are several other schemes like Fund of Funds, Start-Up India, and Start-Up Credit Guarantee schemes that are assisting our youth. Further, the extension of tax benefits to Start-ups and investments made by sovereign wealth funds/pension funds, till 31st March 2025 depicts the government’s effort to support the startup eco- system.This aligns quite well with India Sanitation Coalition’s efforts to give impetus to the start-up world. Over the past 7 editions of our ISC-FICCI Sanitation Awards, we have recognized and promoted several start-ups in the sanitation space, many of whom are successful businesses now!While the finance minister did not provide detailed information on Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH), the budget allocation sees a slight increase in spend demonstrating continued focus on this highly successful program. The acknowledgement that the private sector has increasingly played a substantial role in addressing WASH issues in both urban and rural areas, with numerous projects underway through Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs), highlights the government's commitment to addressing challenges in this sector.A perfect example is the LightHouse Initiative initiated by the Department of Drinking Water along with the India Sanitation Coalition (ISC) by partnering with major corporates across India to develop model villages in Solid and Liquid Waste Management (SLWM) under SBM-Grameen. From this budget, there is an expectation that the government will persist in prioritizing Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) as the path toward achieving the country's Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6). Additionally, it is hoped that the government will uphold its commitment to making necessary infrastructural investments for SLWM.The budget speech rightly celebrates the fact that we have 83 lakh SHGs and 9 crore women beneficiaries. The microfinance movement in the country and the possibility of empowering women members of SHGs through livelihood skilling is a key to bringing women into mainstream economic advancement.The focus on green growth, rooftop solar, wind, biomass, e-vehicles all help with our green energy thrust. The tourism sector was mentioned and could be a huge job provider for youth and women.Guided by the principle ‘Reform, Perform, and Transform’, the budget emphasizes efficient implementation of various policies by improving coordination with states and relevant stakeholders. This is critical both for infra spend and social programsIt is noteworthy that ISC’s Climate Resilient Coastal Cities project which is being implemented in PPP (Public-Private Partnership) mode in four coastal states of Karnataka, Gujarat, Goa and Maharashtra is congruent with the government’s priority of promoting climate-resilient activities for the blue economy 2.0, a scheme for restoration and adaptation measures, and coastal aquaculture.The budget also focuses on the Aspirational districts program where assistance will be given to the states for faster development of aspirational districts and blocks, including the generation of ample economic opportunities. This is again very crucial as it has a huge potential to transform the landscape of our country while making sure no -one is left behind.Overall, this budget has embraced economic strategies and develops the building blocks that nurture and uphold growth, promote inclusive and sustainable development, and enhance productivity.","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year.

"Flush with funds, venture capitals scout for startup deals",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/flush-with-funds-venture-capitals-scout-for-startup-deals/articleshow/109766297.cms,"MUMBAI/CHENNAI: After a brief period of lull, investors seem to have actively started scouting for deals and cutting cheques for Indian startups.Of late, both global and domestic venture capital (VC) and private equity (PE) investors including the likes of US-based Norwest Venture Partners have raised new funds. A sizeable amount of this capital is earmarked for India and there is pressure on investors to deploy.LVMH-backed PE fund L Catterton, for instance, is launching a new investment vehicle which will fund consumer-focused Indian firms.In fact, an estimated $25 billion of India-focused capital is sitting unallocated, according to industry executives. Moreover, with China facing a slowdown, India has become more palatable for investors within the broader Asia market.“The China slowdown has benefited India and it will continue to do so for some more time,” Vikram Gupta, founder and managing partner at homegrown VC fund IvyCap Ventures, which has backed startups like Purplle and Dhruva Space, told TOI. On Tuesday, the company made the final close of its fund III, raising Rs 2,100 crore.About Rs 1,250 crore from the Rs 2,100 crore fund will be used to make 25 new series A investments and a portion of the fund’s corpus will also go towards follow-on investments in existing companies. IvyCap Ventures is looking to bet on consumer focused firms deploying AI, machine learning and other new emerging technologies to build products. “Series A is our sweet spot. Besidesconsumer tech, we are also closing two health tech deals as we speak. We also see opportunities in fintech, space tech, climate and clean tech spaces,” Gupta said, adding that deals including late stage ones will pick up in the second half of the year.PE-VC funding sure still lags — data sourced from market research firm Venture Intelligence showed that investments in the January-April period stood at $8.1 billion, lower than $12.3 billion during the year-ago period. However, with enough capital, new fund launches by investors and ecosystem stability setting in, second half is expected to see significant deal momentum. Last week, Norwest Venture Partners closed a $3 billion fund, a portion of which will be used to make investments in India alongside US and Israel. The company which has been operational in India since 2005 and has backed unicorns like Swiggy and OfBusiness typically invests $250-$300 million in the country annually. Earlier this year, Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin’s B Capital also raised a large $750 million fund to bet on late stage tech companies with focus on Asia and North America. Indian startups Meesho, PharmEasy and Khatabook are among its portfolio firms.“The general sense is that we will start seeing a sustained recovery on a YoY basis starting in the second half of 2024. In the VC segment, home grown firms like Blume Ventures, Fireside Ventures and Anicut Capital, are taking new bets in recent months,” said Arun Natarajan, founder at Venture Intelligence.For L Catterton, there has never been a better time to deepen its India commitment given the country’s huge population and high GDP growth , said global co-CEO Michael Chu. The company’s Asia platform has formed a joint venture partnership with former Hindustan Unilever chief Sanjiv Mehta to drive its India strategy. Gurgaon-based institutional investor Oister Global has recently launched a Rs 440 crore fund, a significant part of which will fund tech startups. The company will not directly invest in a startup but instead rout its funding through investments in VC and PE funds.","After a brief period of lull, investors seem to have actively started scouting for deals and cutting cheques for Indian startups.

While G&B will design and construct projects on the land, GPL will market them, a source said, adding “GPL will earn 10% of the net sales of the development on the land”.A significant part of the 3,000-acre sprawl is covered with mangroves which are protected, but nearly 1,000 acres of it can be developed. The family has held these land parcels since the early 1940s after winning them in a government auction and acquiring adjoining plots over the decades. This developable land is estimated to be worth Rs 1 lakh crore.A 2015 survey by the state’s Slum Rehabilitation Authority showed that nine private landowners and private trusts control around 6,600 acres in Mumbai, whose limits stretch from Colaba to Dahisar in the western suburbs and up to Mulund in the eastern suburbs.The F E Dinshaw Trust (controlled by Wadia Group chairman Nusli Wadia) owns 683 acres of land in Malad while the Pratap Singh Surji Vallabhdas family controls 647 acres in Bhandup, showed the survey, which is the last available findings by a state authority.According to the Godrej family settlement pact, both branches of the family can use the Godrej brand across the spectrum of real estate businesses— from design to development to marketing of projects and for facilities management services.However, the agreement restricts G&B from buying additional land for developing residential projects though it can buy land for its in-house requirements like setting up a manufacturing facility. In other words, G&B can only use its existing land banks to develop residential projects. This existing land bank would include holdings outside Vikhroli, for which G&B will control everything—from development to sales of projects, the source added.GPL will have no construction or marketing rights there.G&B is unlisted and will be under full ownership of Jamshyd and Smita as part of the settlement agreement. GPL, with a market capitalisation of Rs 73,641 crore, is one of the most successful companies in the Godrej Group.","Siblings Jamshyd Godrej and Smita Crishna will hold exclusive construction rights over 3,000-odd acres of land holdings in Mumbai.

Industry watchers blamed it on poor traction from the agriculture sector after harvesting, spaced out polling and people’s preference for personal transport — the latter also boosting petrol sales, particularly from people driving to cooler climes to escape the heat.Aviation fuel also got a boost from early start of holiday season at the end of school exams, the heat wave and marriages.","Preliminary sales data of the state-run fuel retailers put diesel demand — a key indicator of economic activities — falling 2.3% in April from a year ago.

"Canada curtails its start-up visa program, less than a 1000 applications will be accepted this year",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/canada-curtails-its-start-up-visa-program-less-than-a-1000-applications-will-be-accepted-this-year/articleshow/109729628.cms,"MUMBAI: In July last year, Canada sought to make its start-up visa program more attractive, but an announcement on Monday night, will put an end to the dreams of aspiring immigrant entrepreneurs . In fact, several of them, who had got initial funding or got support from business incubators may find themselves at a loose end.From April 30, Canada has capped the number of permanent residence applications that will be accepted for processing each year, to those associated with no more than 10 startups per designated organisation.According to a release issued by the Immigration Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC), the reason behind this move is to reduce the backlog and improve processing times of the applications filed.Put simply, currently there are approximately 82 such designated organisations comprising venture capital funds (VCFs), angel investors and business incubators. Thus, it means that not more than 820 applications will be accepted (assuming that the number of such organisations remains constant).In addition, the announcement states that priority processing will be available for entrepreneurs whose start-up is supported by Canadian capital or by a business incubator that is a member of Canada’s Tech Network.The startup visa (SUV) program offers a clear path to permanent residence and does not require the entrepreneur-applicants to invest any of their funds or have a minimum net worth, but they need to show adequate funds to support themselves and their family on arrival in Canada. Support from one or more of the designated partners, viz: venture capital funds (VCF), angel investor groups (who need to invest at least Canadian dollars (CAD) 200,00 and 75,000 respectively) or acceptance into a program by a business incubator is a must.The immigration level targets under this program were set at 5,000 for the current year and 6,000 for 2025 and 2026. Josh Schachnow, an immigration lawyer and founder of a tech fir, points out, “But now they're being reduced to basically nothing (with less than 100 designated entities, it means less than 1,000 applications through SUV for the entire year).”Many in the entrepreneur-funding sector and immigration experts, view this to be a bad move. In 2023, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) had ranked Canada as the most attractive destination for startup founders. Since the program began in 2013, about 900 entrepreneurs have become permanent residents through this category, representing the launch of more than 300 start-ups. Incidentally, the US does not have a specific visa with a pathway to citizenship for immigrant entrepreneurs.In addition, Canada’s immigration minister, Marc Miller announced a full pause on application intake for the Self-­Employed Persons Program to focus on processing applications from the inventory, starting April 30, 2024. The Self-Employed Persons Program provides a pathway to permanent residence for people with notable experience in art, culture, recreation or sports and who will contribute to Canada’s cultural vitality. Due to the high number of applications submitted for this program, processing times have increased to beyond four years. While the pause is in place, IRCC will continue finalizing applications from the backlog while assessing options for reforming the program and ensuring its integrity, states a release.","From April 30, Canada has capped the number of permanent residence applications that will be accepted for processing each year.

With their growth potential, meme coins have been shaking things up in the digital currency sector. Traders put their money into meme coins rather than gold as gold prices reach all-time highs. Today, we will discuss five of the popular meme coins that have piqued interest: KangaMoon (KANG), Floki (FLOKI), Bonk (BONK), Dogwifhat (WIF) and Shiba Inu (SHIB).First on our meme coins to watch list is KangaMoon (KANG) - a shining presale star that many traders gravitate toward as gold prices rise.This presale project has already obtained over $5.8M and may reach $6M before April 2024 ends. Moreover, over 20,000 people are registered community members, and 6,000 are KANG holders.This number is projected to increase as KangaMoon recently announced a significant partnership with RaidSharks. With this development, KangaMoon will introduce thrilling raids with an outstanding $1,000 monthly reward pool.Unlike most meme coins, KANG will have actual utility. It will be the main in-game currency for KangaMoon’s upcoming P2E game, allowing you to buy in-game items and upgrade your characters. Moreover, KangaMoon is now giving its most active community members free KANG tokens before its official launch, which is an excellent way to give back to its community.In Stage 5 of its presale, one KANG costs only $0.0196 - a 290% ROI for those who bought it early on. Market analysts predict another 100x jump once a Tier-1 CEX lists this meme coin in Q2 of 2024. This price prediction could come true thanks to its connections to the resilient P2E market, which may reach $885M by 2028. Thus, KANG is one of the best meme coins to invest in now.Next, we must discuss Floki (FLOKI) trading in the green. CoinMarketCap data shows that the Floki price soared from $0.00013 to $0.00019 over the last seven days, and its market cap increased from $1.30B to $1.90B in that time. Crypto analyst Captain Faibik predicts Floki will soon see a 2x or 3x bullish rally.The technical analysis for this meme coin supports this prediction. For example, the Floki coin is now trading above its 50—and 100-day EMAs. Not only that, but Floki boasts 26 technical indicators in the buy zone. Therefore, experts in the crypto field predict a rise to $0.000287 for Floki within Q2 of 2024, making it one of the top meme coins to invest in as gold is soaring.Bonk (BONK) is another dominant force in the meme coin space . Over the last week, the Bonk price increased from $0.000014 to $0.000027, according to CoinMarketCap data. Its market cap surged from $905M to $1.78B during that period. The crypto analyst behind the More Crypto Online YouTube channel forecasts a jump to $0.00078 for this meme coin soon.Currently, the Bonk crypto is trading above its 21 and 50-day EMAs. In addition, over 24 technical indicators are showing green for Bonk. Thus, market analysts forecast a potential hike to $0.000039 for BONK before Q2 of 2024 ends.In second-to-last place on our meme coin list is Dogwifhat (WIF). According to CoinMarketCap data, the Dogwifhat price surged from $2.49 to $3.41 in the past seven days, and its market cap rose from $2.45B to $3.40B. With this trend continuing, Dogwifhat is another of the best meme coins to buy as the value of gold skyrockets.The technical analysis for the Dogwifhat crypto also shows bullish signals. For instance, there are now 19 technical indicators in the buy zone for Dogwifhat. Because of this, experts in the crypto field have made a bullish Dogwifhat price prediction. They forecast a surge to $4.53 within Q2 of 2024 for Dogwifhat.Last, we must mention Shiba Inu (SHIB) - one of the meme coin titans . The Shiba Inu price rose from $0.000021 to $0.000026 during the previous seven days. In that period, SHIB’s market cap surged from $12.76B to $15.76B.The Shiba Inu technical analysis has recently been under bull control. Notably, the Shiba Inu coin is now trading above its 100—and 200-day EMAs. Additionally, 28 technical indicators are flashing green for Shiba Inu. As a result, market analysts remain bullish for SHIB. They foresee a potential jump to $0.000040 for this meme coin before Q2 of 2024 finishes.Traders are looking towards meme coins for possible profits as the price of gold soars to record levels. Meme coins have risks and volatility but can yield massive returns if you’re open to digital assets. With rapid expansion, KangaMoon, Floki, Bonk, Dogwifhat and Shiba Inu could skyrocket.However, KangaMoon has a distinct advantage—a low market cap of $19.6M. In other words, KANG will need only $19.6M for its current price to double, which means faster growth than its rivals. With this advantage plus its utility, KANG emerges as one of the best meme coins to invest in now.

"IMF boosts Asia growth forecast this year on China, India",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/imf-boosts-asia-growth-forecast-this-year-on-china-india/articleshow/109709554.cms,"The International Monetary Fund boosted its growth forecast for Asia this year, reflecting a rosier outlook for the region’s two largest economies and flagging a possible upward revision in its outlook for China.Asia is set to expand 4.5% in 2024 from the prior year, 0.3 percentage points higher than the October regional outlook but a slowdown from last year’s 5% pace, according to the IMF report on Tuesday.The latest data has taken into account the higher forecast for India published earlier this month and China’s pace, on the back of expectations that government stimulus will boost growth. On China, the IMF said first-quarter growth came in stronger than expected on robust exports and manufacturing demand, which may prompt another upward revision.“Global disinflation and the prospect of lower central bank interest rates have made a soft landing more likely, hence risks to the near-term outlook are now broadly balanced,” Krishna Srinivasan , director of IMF’s Asia and Pacific department, wrote in a blog post.China’s central government has ramped up spending this year to support an economy still reeling from a weakened property sector and to propel growth to its target near 5% this year. In India, the government ramped up capital spending by a third for 2024, the third year in a row.China’s real gross domestic product is seen expanding 4.6% in 2024 from the prior year, and India to rise 6.8% this year, the IMF said. Officials left the 2025 regional outlook unchanged at a 4.3% advance.Several risks remain, the IMF said. Chief among them is a long-term property sector downturn in China, which would weaken demand and prolong deflation. Other challenges include growing fiscal deficits and risks to trade from US-China tensions.Officials also warned Asian nations of pinning too much on expectations for the Federal Reserve’s path when deciding their own monetary policy. Indonesia this month unexpectedly raised interest rates to address a currency walloped by a strengthening US dollar. Southeast Asia’s largest economy is among many countries in the region contending with currency depreciation as the prospects of early Fed rate cuts wane.While following the Fed “could limit exchange rate volatility” but “it risks that central banks would fall behind (or move ahead of) the curve and destabilize inflation expectations,” Srinivasan wrote.","Asia is set to expand 4.5% in 2024 from the prior year, 0.3 percentage points higher than the October regional outlook.

China firms go 'underground' on Russia payments as banks pull back,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/china-firms-go-underground-on-russia-payments-as-banks-pull-back/articleshow/109683902.cms,"Going 'underground'

Sanctions warning

'Channel can be shut'

An appliance maker in southern China is finding it hard to ship its products to Russia , not because of any problems with the gadgets but because China's big banks are throttling payments for such transactions out of concern over US sanctions.To settle payments for its electrical goods, the Guangdong-based company is considering using currency brokers active along China's border with Russia, said the company's founder, Wang, who asked to be identified only by his family name.The US has imposed an array of sanctions on Russia and Russian entities since the country invaded Ukraine in 2022.Now the threat of extending these to banks in China - a country Washington blames for ""powering"" Moscow's war effort - is chilling the finance that lubricates even non-military trade from China to Russia.This is posing a growing problem for small Chinese exporters, said seven trading and banking sources familiar with the situation.As China's big banks pull back from financing Russia-related transactions, some Chinese companies are turning to small banks on the border and underground financing channels such as money brokers - even banned cryptocurrency - the sources told Reuters.Others have retreated entirely from the Russian market, the sources said.""You simply cannot do business properly using the official channels,"" Wang said, as big banks now take months rather than days to clear payments from Russia, forcing him to tap unorthodox payment channels or shrink his business.A manager at a large state-owned bank he previously used told Wang the lender was worried about possible US sanctions in dealing with Russian transactions, Wang said.A banker at one of China's Big Four state banks said it had tightened scrutiny of Russia-related businesses to avert sanctions risk. ""The main reason is to avoid unnecessary troubles,"" said the banker, who asked not to be named.Since last month, Chinese banks have intensified their scrutiny of Russia-related transactions or halted business altogether to avoid being targeted by US sanctions, the sources said.""Transactions between China and Russia will increasingly go through underground channels,"" said the head of a trade body in a southeastern province that represents Chinese businesses with Russian interests. ""But these methods carry significant risks.""Making payments in crypto, banned in China since 2021, might be the only option, said a Moscow-based Russian banker, as ""it's impossible to pass through KYC (know-your-customer) at Chinese banks, big or small"".The sources spoke on condition of anonymity, citing the sensitivity of the topic. Reuters could not determine the extent of transactions that had shifted from major banks to more obscure routes.China's foreign ministry is not aware of the practices described by the businesspeople to arrange payments or troubles in settling payments through major Chinese banks, a spokesperson said, referring questions to ""the relevant authorities"".The People's Bank of China and the National Financial Regulatory Administration, the country's banking sector regulator, did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken , after meeting China's top diplomat Wang Yi for five and a half hours in Beijing on Friday, said he had expressed ""serious concern"" that Beijing was ""powering Russia's brutal war of aggression against Ukraine"".Still, his visit, which included meeting President Xi Jinping , was the latest in a series of steps that have tempered the public acrimony that drove relations between the world's biggest economies to historic lows last year.While officials have warned that the United States was ready to take action against Chinese financial institutions facilitating trade in goods with dual civilian and military applications and the US preliminarily has discussed sanctions on some Chinese banks, a US official told Reuters last week Washington does not yet have a plan to implement such measures.The Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said, ""China does not accept any illegal, unilateral sanctions. Normal trade cooperation between China and Russia is not subject to disruption by any third party.""A State Department spokesperson, asked about Reuters findings that Chinese banks were curbing payments from Russia and the impact on some Chinese companies, said, ""Fuelling Russia's defence industrial base not only threatens Ukrainian security, it threatens European security.""Beijing cannot achieve better relations with Europe while supporting the greatest threat to European security since the end of the Cold War,"" the spokesperson said.Blinken made clear to Chinese officials ""that ensuring transatlantic security is a core US interest,"" the spokesperson said. ""If China does not address this problem, the United States will.""Nearly all major Chinese banks have suspended settlements from Russia since the beginning of March, said a manager at a listed electronics company in Guangdong.Some of the biggest state-owned lenders have reported drops in Russia-related business, reversing a surge in assets after Russia's invasion.Among the Big Four, China Construction Bank posted a drop of 14% in its Russian subsidiary's assets last year and Agricultural Bank of China a 7% decline, according to their latest filings.By contrast, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China , the country's biggest lender, reported a 43% jump in assets of its Russian unit. Bank of China (BOC), the fourth-largest, did not give the breakdown.The four banks did not respond to requests for comment on their Russian businesses or the impact on Chinese companies.Some rural banks in northeast China along the Russian border can still collect payments, but this has led to a bottleneck, with some businesspeople saying they have been lining up for months to open accounts.A chemical and machinery company in Jiangsu province has been waiting for three months to open an account at Jilin Hunchun Rural Commercial Bank in the northeastern province of Jilin, said Liu, who works at the firm and also asked to be identified by family name.Calls to the bank seeking comment went unanswered.BOC has blocked a payment from Liu's Russian clients since February, and a bank loan officer said firms exporting heavy equipment face more stringent reviews in receiving payments, Liu said.The manager at the listed Guangdong company said their firm had opened accounts at seven banks since last month but none agreed to accept payments from Russia.""We gave up on the Russian market,"" the manager said. ""We eventually didn't receive more than 10 million yuan ($1.4 million) in payments from the Russian side, and we just gave up. The process of collecting payments is extremely annoying.""Wang is also having second thoughts about his Russian business.""I may gradually shrink my business in Russia as the slow process of collecting money is not good for the company's liquidity management,"" he said.""What's more, you don't know what will happen in the future. The channel can be shut completely one day.""",China's big banks are throttling payments for such transactions out of concern over US sanctions. The US has imposed an array of sanctions on Russia and Russian entities since the country invaded Ukraine in 2022. Now the threat of extending these to banks in China is chilling the finance that lubricates even non-military trade from China to Russia.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109684415,imgsize-1183423,width-400,resizemode-4/109684415.jpg"
Yen sinks to 34-year low past 160 per dollar,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/yen-sinks-to-34-year-low-past-160-per-dollar/articleshow/109677576.cms,"HONG KONG: The yen sank to a new 34-year low past 160 per dollar on Monday after a forecast-beating US inflation reading dented expectations for US interest rate cuts this year.The greenback bought 160.17 yen in morning trade - its weakest since 1990 - fanning speculation that Japanese authorities would step in to support their currency.Friday's forecast-beating reading on the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index came after the Bank of Japan (BoJ) refused to tighten monetary policy further at its meeting last week.Officials have repeatedly said they are ready to step in if there are wild movements in the exchange rate, citing speculators as a key issue.However, observers were sceptical that a first intervention since late 2022 would have much of an impact.""Expectations of intervention having a sustained impact may disappoint given macro fundamentals do not support a sudden shift to a hawkish monetary stance,"" said National Australia Bank's Tapas Strickland.The advance in the US PCE followed a third straight jump in the consumer price index.That, along with push-back by US Federal Reserve decision-makers warning against cutting too soon, has led investors to revise their outlook for how many reductions there would be this year.They now expect just one, having priced in as many as six at the start of 2024.The Fed's latest policy announcement this week will be pored over for fresh guidance on officials' plans for monetary policy.The BoJ called time on negative rates last month with its first rise in borrowing costs in 17 years as inflation finally settled around two percent after the ""lost decades"" of deflation and stagnation.Friday's decision to keep its benchmark rate between zero and 0.1 percent was keenly awaited, with the bank saying that ""accommodative financial conditions will be maintained for the time being"".The BoJ has been a global outlier in sticking to an ultra-loose policy while other central banks pushed rates up as they fought against surging inflation -- causing a wide differential that saw investors buy up other currencies.""Markets appear to be trying to push dollar-yen towards 160 in the absence of official intervention,"" said Vishnu Varathan, at Mizuho Bank.",The greenback bought 160.17 yen in morning trade - its weakest since 1990.
