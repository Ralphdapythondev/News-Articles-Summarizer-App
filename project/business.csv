Millennials, also known as Generation Y, are people born between 1981 and 1996. This means, currently their age range is between 28 to 43 years old, precisely.Diwali signifies the start of Samvat 2082 , the start of the new year, making it an auspicious opportunity for millennials to begin their new investing habits.Based on the age group mentioned above, millennials can be categorized into two segments based on their age groups: one is less than 30 years old, and the other is in their late 30s or early 40s. These two groups are in two different stages of their lives; the first category will have different aspirations or goals to achieve, and they will be focused on consumption-oriented goals like purchasing a house, covering marriage expenses, purchasing a car, etc.They will be in an acquisition stage and also moving towards planning for wealth creation . The other category will have achieved most of their aspirations in life and will be looking forward to wealth generation and retirement planning.Millennials typically have a bucket of regular expenses like living expenses, travel expenses, child education expenses, EMIs, rental costs, etc. The key to addressing these challenges is budgeting, where one can set up basic expense percentages like income to expenses should be less than 50%, EMI expenses should be 20 to 25%, and investment portion should be at least 25%; anything above this could be a best. This broad diversification of budgeting helps you to improve financial discipline and meet your obligations comfortably.Diwali is a very common time when individuals get bonuses from their respective organizations, and this lump sum amount can be prudently used towards savings and partially towards celebrations.Apart from this setting goals forms an important aspect and such as creating a basket for each goal, such as short-term goals like paying off small debts and taking a domestic holiday vacation. Medium-term goals like purchasing a car or going on a holiday trip to a dream destination. Long-term goals like retirement planning, purchasing a house, and generational wealth.As we enter this auspicious period, it’s essential to balance your portfolio by including both growth and defensive assets. Equity and real estate are seen as growth-oriented, while gold and debt are considered defensive assets. But each investment option carries a degree of risk; investors can manage those by understanding the underlying risks of each investment option.Investing exclusively in debt products can lead to zero real returns in an inflationary environment, making it essential to pair them with growth assets like equities, which can yield 12-14% returns over the long term. While gold has not consistently outperformed in all five-year timeframes, making it less reliable as a defensive asset compared to debt, real estate has notably underperformed, with most of the properties in urban cities failing to outperform Nifty 50 returns along with liquidity issues.In an asset mix, the primary consideration should be investing across the assets that are low-correlated to each other, like equity and debt. This approach will help to reduce volatility.For instance, an investor Rahul invested a 10 lakhs FD 10 years ago, which had an interest rate of around 6.5%, which helped him a corpus of 18 lakhs, but if he had invested the same in the asset mix of equity and debt, in the same period he could have generated more than 33 lakhs, which is significantly substantial.Thus , diversifying across the asset classes is key to reducing volatility and enhancing overall portfolio stability.Investors can take exposure to equity through multiple options like direct equity, PMS, AIF, and equity MF. However, among all equity, MF is the best choice as it offers diversification and professional management with expertise fund managers, which makes it a cost-effective option to take exposure in equities.These products that offer fixed returns of 6 to 8%, investors have various avenues to invest, such as FDs, debt MFs, PFs, arbitrage funds, etc.No one can predict an unexpected emergency crisis that could be like your medical expenses or any other unexpected expenditure, so having a safety net consisting of your next 6 months to 1 year expenses in liquid corpus helps you to avoid disturbing your investment account for an emergency crisis.Investing during Diwali presents a wonderful opportunity to align your financial goals with the spirit of the season. By considering a well-bounded investment strategy,millennials can create a diversified portfolio, which would keep the darkness away from your portfolio and keep it shining. Investors should also remember to diversify their investments across the asset classes.By following these steps, investors can make informed decisions that lead to sustainable wealth growth and financial security.","Millennials typically have a bucket of regular expenses like living expenses, travel expenses, child education expenses, EMIs, rental costs, etc. The key to addressing these challenges is budgeting, where one can set up basic expense percentages like income to expenses should be less than 50%.

Top Performing Silver ETFs

Gold vs Silver buying: Silver presents an attractive option for aggressive investors seeking portfolio diversification and alpha generation beyond traditional equities, believe analysts. Despite the recent surge in domestic prices, which saw silver reach the Rs 1 lakh per kg mark, analysts suggest that investors consider allocating 3-5% of their portfolio to the white metal by buying on dips over the next 1-3 months.Since the beginning of the calendar year 2024, silver has experienced impressive gains, rising by 33.65% to touch the Rs 1 lakh per kg mark. In the past month alone, it has gained 12.5%, outperforming the Nifty 50 index, which returned 12.5% during the calendar year but lost 5.6% over the past month.In dollar terms, silver's performance has been even more remarkable, with gains of 47.25% and 13.56%, respectively, over the same periods.Vishnu Kant Upadhyay, AVP-Research and Advisory at Master Capital Services, attributes the increasing market value of silver to its extensive use in various industries.""Silver is extensively utilised in electronics, solar panels, batteries, and increasingly in semiconductors, making it a critical component in modern technology. The growing industrial demand for silver along with the anticipation of another rate cut by the Federal Reserve is causing an increase in the metal's market value,” he told ET.Also Read | Silver better than gold for investment? Silver prices cross Rs 1 lakh mark! Manav Modi, a bullion analyst at Motilal Oswal Financial Services, highlights the factors supportingsilver prices , including ""Rising industrial demand, high domestic imports, ETF buying by investors and Fed rate cuts have been supportive for silver.""While acknowledging the possibility of profit-booking following the sharp rally, Modi advises investors to view major dips as buying opportunities. He projects that silver could reach Rs 1.25 lakh per kg over the next 12 months.As advancements in technology continue and the need for electronic devices and semiconductors grows, the demand for silver is expected to remain strong, leading to a sustained upward trend in prices.Bhavesh Jain, co-head of Hybrid and Solutions Funds at Edelweiss Asset Management, stated, ""Silver has seen a strong long-term bullish break; the trend could likely continue supported by lower rates for longer and the revival in Chinese industrial activity."" Jain suggests that investing in silver ETFs is a more convenient option for investors compared to purchasing physical silver.Also Read | Looking to beat fixed deposit returns? Here’s what investors can consider instead of FD However, some fund managers believe that the long-term prospects of silver will be influenced by the adoption and adherence to climate change and green technology initiatives by major global economies.Vikram Dhawan, head of commodities and fund manager at Nippon India Mutual Fund, explained, ""If investors believe in Earth's rising temperature problem and its consequences, silver can serve as a proxy hedge.""Nirav Karkera, head of research at Fisdom, advises, ""Aggressive investors could buy on every fall and allocate 5-15% of their portfolio to the white metal.""Dhawan pointed out that in the short term, silver prices may be affected by a Republican victory in the US, as Donald Trump is not known for his environmentalist stance and instead favors fossil fuels.Considering the anticipated volatility, the upcoming US elections, and uncertainty regarding further rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, wealth managers recommend that investors consider staggering their silver purchases.","Since the beginning of calendar year 2024, silver has experienced impressive gains, rising by 33.65%.

Lulu Retail Holdings IPO : Running one of the Middle East's biggest hypermarket chains, Lulu Retail Holdings, has started the process for its initial public offering (IPO). According to bankers, this IPO has the potential to be the largest in the UAE this year.Lulu, founded in 1974 by Indian businessman Yusuff Ali , follows other grocery firms that have recently listed, such as UAE-based Spinneys this year and Saudi grocery retailer BinDawood Holding in 2020.The IPO, scheduled from October 28 to November 5, will offer more than 2.582 billion shares, with trading expected to commence on the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange on November 14, as per Lulu's IPO document.The conglomerate, which operates over 240 stores across the six Gulf Co-operation Council countries, is launching its IPO amidst a thriving retail spending environment in the region, which is encouraging domestic listings by companies in the sector.Two sources involved in the transaction told Reuters that the offering could raise between $1.7 billion and $1.8 billion for the 25% stake.Chief Executive Saifee Rupawala expressed confidence in Lulu's continued success, saying in the IPO document, ""We are confident that Lulu will continue to be where the world comes to shop.""He highlighted the $100-billion market opportunity presented by GCC retail over the next five years and emphasized the firm's potential for further growth in Saudi Arabia.Consumers in the Middle East are increasingly opting for local and regional brands over international ones.

(AI image)

DA Hike Calculator: How much will the take home salary increase?

To understand the impact of this 3% DA hike, let's consider an example:

Assuming a central government employee has a basic pay of Rs 46,200, their previous dearness allowance at 50% was Rs 23,100. With the DA now at 53%, their dearness allowance will increase to Rs 24,486.

This means they will receive an additional Rs 1,386 (Rs 24,486 - Rs 23,100) in DA from October. As the DA hike is effective from July 1, 2024, they will also receive arrears for the last three months.

DR Hike Calculator: How much will the pension increase?

If a central government pensioner receives a basic pension of Rs 50,400 per month, at the previous 50% DR, they were getting Rs 25,200.

With the DR now at 53%, they will receive Rs 26,712 monthly as dearness relief. This means their pension will increase by Rs 1,512 per month.

DA hike calculator : PM Narendra Modi-led Union Cabinet has approved a 3% increase in the dearness allowance (DA) for central government employees on October 16, 2024. Additionally, the dearness relief (DR) for central government pensioners has also been raised by 3%. As a result of this latest hike, the DA and DR now stand at 53% for both central government employees and pensioners respectively. This decision is set to benefit over 1 crore individuals.The dearness allowance, a component of the salary for government employees and pensioners, has been increased to 53%. This rise in DA will lead to an increase in the take-home salary of central government employees starting from October 2024.The effective date for the increased DA and DR is July 1, 2024. The central government typically revises these allowances twice a year, in January and July, with official announcements being made at a later date. Consequently, the DA/DR hike is implemented retrospectively from the cut-off date of July 1, 2024.Also Read | Dearness allowance hiked!

Revenue from operations stayed flat Rs 37,449 crore during the second quarter of the current financial year, as against Rs 37,339 crore in the year-ago period.Bhargava said the company has cut down on wholesales to align its inventory levels to retail demand.

Traders will continue to watch key technical levels on the Nifty index after Tuesday’s dramatic intra-day recovery.

There could be sharp reactions to earnings, with Larsen & Toubro and Tata Power among the key announcements today.Shares of India’s biggest e-scooter maker Ola Electric fell below their IPO price, as the company struggles with market share losses and rising consumer complaints. This has not been a good month for investors in mainboard offerings, with three out of the four listings — Hyundai Motor India, Garuda Construction and Deepak Builders — trading below their issue prices. They don’t ring a bell at the top, goes a market saying. But a string of flops could be a good indicator that the IPO frenzy may have peaked for now.Shares of two-wheeler majors TVS Motor, Bajaj Auto and Hero MotoCorp have had a miserable October so far, falling between 14% and 20%. Bajaj Auto warned of weak demand during the festive season, but the situation on the ground appears to be slightly better. According to Yes Securities, two-wheeler sales are expected to be much better than car sales mainly due to a recovery in demand from first-time buyers in both rural and urban markets. The broker sees October retail two-wheeler sales rising 20% over last year.October has been bruising for investors in mid-cap stocks, but November may hold promise. The Nifty Midcap 100 index has risen in November during eight out of the past 10 years, with an average gain of about 3%, according to JM Financial. The mid-cap gauge has also outperformed the Nifty 50 index in seven out of the past 10 instances.

MG, a unit of Chinese giant SAIC , had been facing challenges in expanding its operations in India after the introduction of Press Note 3 in 2020 during the Covid-19 lockdown.The measure had seen govt withdraw automatic FDI approval for companies with significant beneficial ownership from countries that share a land border with India. The move was initiated to scrutinise proposals related to Chinese companies instead of giving an automatic green light in non-strategic sectors.Facing challenges in accessing fresh funding, SAIC decided to dilute stake in the India subsidiary through the deal with JSW Group. It also diluted 8% equity in favour of an Indian financial investor and gave 5% to employees as ESOPs and 3% to dealers. After this, the Chinese partner has 49% equity.The new entity is now petitioning govt to allow access to PLI benefits, especially in view of its changed ownership where Indian entities and nationals hold the majority stake.JSW MG Motor India said: “The consolidated Indian shareholding after JV is 51% and Chinese shareholding is 49%.” “The company and JV partners obtained requisite clearances/ approvals as may be required for consummation of the transaction,” it said.Sources said that under the new JV — called JSW MG Motor India — has been petitioning the govt for “relaxation in scrutiny in view of the majority holding by Indians”.

Coca-Cola plans price cut,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/campa-effect-coca-cola-plans-price-cut/articleshow/114753849.cms,"Mumbai: Coca-Cola is planning to slash the price of its 400 ml PET bottles to Rs 20 from Rs 25 earlier, distributor sources told TOI. The revised prices are likely to be implemented in a week at least in the Southern markets of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Kerala. Coca-Cola did not respond to queries.""Since the company has been selling the 400 ml PET bottles for Rs 25, they cannot suddenly change the packaging of the same bottles and mark the price as Rs 20. For attracting customers, they will launch a new packaging wherein they will market the bottles as 250 ml and 150 ml free (250 ml + 150 ml free will be written on the pack) and the MRP will be Rs 20,"" sources said.The move comes amid rival Campa Cola's aggressive market expansion with lower pricing. The Reliance Industries-owned brand has priced its packs lower by Rs 5-20, nudging global beverage giants like Coca-Cola to tweak their own pricing strategies. For instance, Campa Cola sells its 500 ml PET bottles for Rs 20 while Coca Cola's current pricing for 400 ml is Rs 25. Campa's 600 ml bottles are priced at Rs 30 while Coca Cola sells them for Rs 40. For the bigger 2 litre bottles, Campa has a price differential of Rs 20 when compared with Coca-Cola's 2.25 litre bottle packs. To be sure, Coca-Cola largely sells 250 ml, 400 ml, 600ml, 1 litre and 2.25 litre pack size PET bottles through the general trade channels. For modern trade, the availability of PET bottles may vary. They push more of 750 ml and 1.25 litre PET bottles through the modern trade channel compared to 600 ml and 1 litre in general trade.However, distributors of Coca-Cola are concerned as they are sitting on considerable stock of 250 ml bottles which are priced at Rs 20 and they will need to clear them out before the repackaged 400 ml bottles with reduced prices hit the markets. It is not clear as to what will be Coca-Cola's pricing and marketing strategy for the 250 ml bottles going ahead. ""The 250 ml stock will need to be liquidated,"" distributors said.","The revised prices are likely to be implemented in a week at least in the Southern markets of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Kerala.

Railway Budget 2024 : The government has wavered little in its efforts to spur a modernisation of railways in the country, pivoting on technology, to support the country’s economic ambitions. In line with expectations, Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore, marking yet another year of successive increase in outlay.That takes forward the past policies and the government’s vision, which have paved the way for modernisation of the transport behemoth.In earlier decades, the government had focused on laying tracks on new routes, electrification and incremental rolling stock capacity addition. That was the need of the hour back then and has helped set up the base for a larger transformation.For instance, the massive Dedicated Freight Corridor ( DFC ) as well as locomotive factories at Marhaura and Madhepura in Bihar were conceptualised over a decade ago and we are seeing their completion now.More recently, the focus has shifted to modernisation—of rolling stock and safety systems, among other aspects.This year, emphasis has also been laid on the railways’ crucial role in industrial development. Commodity-specific corridors have been planned in eastern India and impetus given to port connectivity. Vande Bharat and technology-led upgrades in rolling stock remain in focus. Safety has been prioritised through budgetary allocations for the anti-collision systemKavach . That said, there are other cogs in the wheel that demand attention from a long-term perspective.First, the target for the Operating Ratio, the crucial efficiency gauge, has been set at 98.22% for 2024-25, compared with 98.65% in 2023-24. This reflects an imminent need for operational transformation. An effective overhaul of the world’s fourth-largest rail network will take many years and thus we need to start focusing on improving efficiency and reducing costs now.DFC is almost entirely operational and will be complete over the next few months. To ensure the project achieves its twin goals of reducing logistics costs and enhancing freight efficiency, railways need to attract more cargo on the corridor. This will help increase the rail coefficient and make the railways’ approach more market-oriented, which will in turn aid future corridors.A revamp of railway stations is on track, with sufficient funds dedicated to this end. But even though new coaches and wagons are increasingly being added to meet footfalls, the stations and passenger trains themselves remain synonymous with chaos.Just as safety, comfort and convenience have been prioritised, there is a need for solutions to address the capacity and demand challenges. As a first step, the government could target development of new stations and setting up of new coach production units.As a leading freight mover, Indian Railways carried a record 1,588 MT cargo in fiscal 2024, up from 1,095 MT in fiscal 2015. It accounts for 26% of the cargo moved in the country—by no means an easy feat. The railways aims to take this volume to 3,000 MT by 2030, which would require a 11% CAGR against the around 4.2% witnessed over the last 10 years. As per a report by TERI and Shakti Foundation, from carrying about 62% of freight traffic in 1990-91, Indian Railways’ share has declined to ~27% in 2014-15. This has been due to the expanding road network, cost competitiveness over railways, and door-to-door service. Thus, commencing the cycle of increasing the rail share again is commendable.DFCs, a high-capacity track network, high-power locomotives and improvement in wagon designs have set the ball rolling for larger capacity, faster freight trains that deliver better efficiency.Yet, achieving exponential growth is a tall ask given the current dynamics. Possibly, similar challenges might apply to other goals the railways might have for 2047.To be fair, despite its scale and complexity, Indian Railways has been able to achieve diverse developments at commendable speed.But the track ahead is long and it is time to start discussing the reinvention of the institutional set-up.Indian Railways sees substantial private sector involvement in the form of vendors and contractors. Policymakers could start mulling extreme options such as parallel privately-owned and operated railway infrastructure, coupled with centralised planning and an evolved role for the railways. This will need a robust policy framework from the Government of India.The time is perhaps also ripe to bring user charge and asset monetisation-driven segments for passengers as well as cargo to the discussion table. Globally, the separation of infrastructure and operations in railways has delivered mixed results, for example in the United Kingdom. The model should be analysed and revisited to understand its potential relevance in the Indian context.The key would be to retrace our steps and align our long-term goals to identify not just incremental changes but also ways to explore bold and path-breaking alternatives that put Indian Railways on a smooth track and bring it up to speed.","Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore.

Budget 2024 capital gains tax changes: The Narendra Modi government is considering suggestions for tweaks in the new long term capital gains tax regime that was announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman in Union Budget 2024.The July 23 budget reduced the LTCG tax on property from 20% to 12.5%. The indexation benefit, which allowed taxpayers to adjust the acquisition cost for inflation before calculating capital gains and thus reduce their tax liability, is proposed to be eliminated for properties purchased on or after April 1, 2001.The government publishes the Cost Inflation Index (CII) annually for this calculation.India Inc is appealing to the government for a gradual shift to the long-term capital gains tax regime proposed in the FY25 budget, which aims to eliminate indexation benefits for property, gold, and other unlisted assets.According to an ET report by Deepshikha Sikarwar, the industry is suggesting alternatives such as a higher tax rate with indexation or a lower rate of 12.5% without indexation, as well as some form of grandfathering for ancestral properties.The finance ministry is currently reviewing these proposals and will discuss them with the Prime Minister's Office.

Budget 2024 for manufacturing sector : The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth. While the middle class has been offered tax relief, the government's primary focus remains on judicious spending to maximize economic impact. The budget's core themes are employment, skilling, MSME development, and support for the middle class.Largely focus has remained intact on spending money judiciously to ensure that each penny spent creates a ripple effect in the entire economic landscape.Although at first glance, manufacturing might appear to have taken a backseat, a deeper analysis reveals a multifaceted approach to bolstering the sector. Initiatives like employment-linked benefits and internship programs, while primarily aimed at job creation and skill development, indirectly benefit manufacturing companies by expanding the talent pool.Extensive focus on the MSME manufacturing units by way of extending term loan facility for purchase of machinery and equipment without collateral or third-party guarantee, would help companies in augmenting their capital base/ capacity and strengthen the very foundation of the manufacturing ecosystem in the country. Development of a new credit-assessment model by Public Sector Banks to assess MSME credit shall provide much needed regulatory relief to the units.With respect to the large manufacturing entities, while there is no direct fiscal/ tax incentive introduced in this budget, some support has been provided with an extensive focus on development of ‘industrial parks’ in nearly 100 cities under the ‘plug and play’ model. Reforms proposed with respect to land administration, planning and management, shall also ease out acquisition related difficulties often faced by entrepreneurs/ business houses in acquiring lands for manufacturing set-ups.Targeted Customs duty interventions like, rationalization of Customs duty provisions in Mobile phone manufacturing setups, extension of Customs duty exemption on import of capital goods for manufacturing of solar cells and panels, full Customs duty exemption on import of 25 critical minerals,, shall provide the required impetus for enhancing domestic manufacturing environment.Governments’ focus on formulating an Economic Policy Framework to set the scope for next-gen reforms in the country, has a target to improve the productivity of factors of production, namely, land, labour, capital, entrepreneurship and technology. This shall pave the way for enabling achievement of a target of 25% manufacturing sector contribution to the nation’s GDP over the course of next 7-10 years.While the overall outlook is positive, the extension of tax benefits under Section 115BAB for manufacturing entities and the absence of new PLI schemes are notable omissions.The country’s manufacturing base is expanding as is reflective from the continuously increasing tax collections and expanding Purchasing Manager’s Index. It would be pertinent to see how the ground realities evolve vis-à-vis the vision envisaged, in the upcoming Financial Year.","While the overall outlook is positive, the extension of tax benefits under Section 115BAB for manufacturing entities and the absence of new PLI schemes are notable omissions.

Budget 2024: Armed with the vision to propel India to become a developed country by 2047, the Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business thereby providing the required stimulus to the manufacturing sector and enabling large scale job creation.On the Indirect tax front, the industry welcomes the much-needed announcement for a comprehensive review of the rate structure under Customs enabling ease in product classification and dispute reduction.The proposal of lowering of Customs duty on a plethora of raw materials and products including solar cells, critical minerals and bullion are encouraging measures. The rationale behind such reduction clearly indicates support towards domestic manufacturing, deepening value addition and supporting targets in reducing carbon footprint.Relevant amendments under the Customs law have been made to provide increased time limits for re-imports and re-exports to enhance competitiveness of the fledgling MRO sector. The government has extended significant duty reduction and exemption benefits to the healthcare and electronics sectors, continuing the impetus of incentives provided under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme.Since their introduction in March 2020, the PLI schemes have indeed supported in revitalizing the manufacturing sector and strengthening the necessary supply chains. The success achieved in the mobile manufacturing sector has now enabled the Government to reduce customs duties on mobile phones and components, signalling a mature environment. The Budget proposals aim at reproducing similar outcomes for semiconductor and pharmaceutical industry by increasing the budgetary allocation.Buoyed by the increasing revenue collection under GST signalling a shift towards a mature tax regime, this Budget has harmonized the timeframes for the issuance of demand notices and adjudication orders for cases involving fraud, suppression or otherwise. Significant amendments to the GST legislations have been introduced reflecting the recommendations proposed by the GST Council such as regularizing non-levy of GST due to general practice which may turn out to be a breather for certain impacted industries reeling under huge tax demands.The Insurance sector has been provided much relief through the GST council recommendations which have been cemented in the present budget thereby ending long standing disputes on their business practices.The Government's efforts to push forward with its reform agenda are evident as plans to incentivize states for their business reform actions plans and digitalization through the Jan Vishwas Bill 2.0 is proposed. Further, setting up of e-commerce export hubs is envisaged to facilitate easier access to international markets for domestic players.The recent implementation of Budget proposals allows the government to maintain momentum in its reform agenda. These policy measures implicitly reaffirm the significance of India Inc as a crucial element in the development of infrastructure. However, there are still some expectations required to be met to march towards a Viksit Bharat 2047.",Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business.

Budget 2024 : Real estate, a significant contributor to employment generation, has received a fair bit of attention in Budget 2024-25. Recent years have seen the sector transform rapidly, driven by factors such as favourable government policies, Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, strong economic growth and changing consumer preferences.Added to that, the budgetary focus on job creation, skilling and employment-linked incentives, infrastructure, urban development, rural connectivity, digitalisation and land-related norms, all dovetail to promote growth of the sector.Launched in June 2015, the PMAY aims to provide affordable housing to all eligible beneficiaries. The budget unveiled PMAY Urban 2.0, under which the housing needs of 1 crore urban poor and middle class will be addressed with an investment of Rs 10 lakh crore.The central government’s additional Rs 2.2 lakh crore injection in the next 5 years to make housing more affordable has the potential to revitalise the affordable housing market.Such an approach can play an important role in realising the government's vision of Housing for All and push growth and development. Hence, the significant investment under PMAY Urban 2.0 is expected to alleviate urban housing deficits, spurring construction and economic growth.Steps to introduce technological reforms within the regulatory framework for land, such as digitalisation or GIS mapping of land records, will improve transparency.Rationalisation of stamp duty across states will also be critical to bring in uniformity and initiate land-related reforms such as urban planning, usage and building bylaws.These are steps in the right direction and will boost growth. Moreover, they will improve the ease of property transactions and strengthen municipal finances through increased property taxes. Rationalization of stamp duty with an emphasis on women homebuyers may boost home-buyer sentiment in major cities, too.The budget has also given ample attention to urban and rural development, with rental housing for industrial workers through the public private partnership model, interest subsidies for rental housing, and transit-oriented developments.The proposal to develop investment-ready plug-and-play industrial parks in 100 cities may attract industrial investment, leading to increased demand for industrial real estate and support the growth of ancillary services and residential developments in these regions.Initiatives for industrial parks and rental housing for industrial workers align with the country’s manufacturing goals and addresses worker accommodation needs.These steps are expected to promote industrial growth and stability in labour-intensive sectors, while also creating new opportunities for real estate developers specialising in rental and affordable housing.The changes in long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax, however, have evoked a mixed reaction. The government lowered the long-term capital gains tax from 20% to 12.5%, which is a welcome step. However, this came with the removal of the indexation benefit.The changes could encourage more liquidity in property transactions and potentially increase the effective tax burden depending on the property’s acquisition date.The launch of Phase IV of the PM Gram Sadak Yojana in 25,000 rural habitations will improve connectivity in rural areas, promoting rural development and making these regions more accessible for investment. The primary objective of PMGSY is to build robust, all-weather roads in rural habitations. This initiative focuses on enhancing connectivity and supporting economic development in rural areas.In essence, the budget is geared towards stimulating growth and investment in the real estate sector , fostering a more transparent and investor-friendly environment, and contributing to overall development. It aims to create a balanced and inclusive growth environment by addressing the needs of various segments, including affordable housing, industrial workers and urban infrastructure.The effectiveness of the initiatives, however, hinges on their implementation and continued support of complementary reforms.","The budget unveiled PMAY Urban 2.0, under which the housing needs of 1 crore urban poor and middle class will be addressed with an investment of Rs 10 lakh crore.

New Budget 2024 rule: Why Income Tax Department is likely to issue a huge number of tax notices this month,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-budget-2024-rule-why-income-tax-department-is-likely-to-issue-a-huge-number-of-tax-notices-this-month/articleshow/112186079.cms,"Taxing Times

Income Tax Notice on the way? The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month, as there are concerns that many taxpayers might escape the tax net due to the impending implementation of the new reassessment law on September 1, 2024.According to the amended regulation announced in Budget 2024 , the tax authorities can only go back a maximum of five years to reassess a taxpayer's records if the escaped income is at least Rs 50 lakh, and three years for an amount less than Rs 50 lakh.Previously, they could reassess cases up to 10 years old.According to an ET report, tax officials are now faced with the challenge of compiling and corroborating data on tax and income mismatches for the financial years 2013-14 to 2017-18 within the next few weeks, as these years will become time-barred for reassessment from September 1, 2024.The I-T department relies on information from various sources, such as banks, property registrars, and search findings from the investigation wing, to build reassessment cases.A tax officers' body has raised concerns about the feasibility of issuing notices under Section 148 (or 148A) in a large number of cases within a single month, given the overburdened nature of the jurisdictional assessing officers and the time-consuming process of obtaining sanction from the chief commissioner, who is the specified authority for such notices.Moreover, the law provides taxpayers with the right to explain their position before reassessment orders are finalized, a process that most believe cannot be completed by the end of August.Also Read | ITR refund status for FY 2023-24: How to check income tax refund status online - here’s a step-by-step guide for incometax.gov.in & NSDL websites The Central Board of Direct Taxes ( CBDT ) has been urged by its officers to postpone the effective date of the proposed amendment. However, this suggestion is unlikely to be well-received by corporations and high net worth individuals.""Capping the reassessment period at five years was a great decision as it would reduce hassles and litigation. But if the department fears there could be a genuine loss of revenue as it may not be possible to wrap up several matters by August 31, the government can think of strict parameters where time-bound cases can be selectively reopened - based on trails of steps taken in identifying escaped income,"" said Mitil Chokshi, partner at CA firm Chokshi & Chokshi.""Taxpayers may expect a rush of reassessment notices in August 2024. These notices are likely to be for the AYs 2018-19 and prior to that. It is pertinent to note that the Bombay High Court in a recent ruling in a case of Hexaware Technologies has taken a view on a proviso introduced in 2021, which can be interpreted to mean that AY 2017-18 (and prior years) got time barred on March 31, 2024. These reassessment notices (for AYs 2017-18 and prior) are likely to rake up new interpretation issues in the already muddled reassessment provisions,"" said Ashish Mehta, partner at law firm Khaitan & Co.The current situation is similar to the conflict between the Income Tax office and taxpayers in 2021. The reassessment law was amended in April 2021, allowing the tax office to reopen 10-year-old tax returns if the total undisclosed income exceeded Rs 50 lakh and reassess 4-year-old matters if the amount was less than Rs 50 lakh.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? However, this change led to over 10,000 writ petitions being filed by companies, arguing that they were not given sufficient time to explain and that the notices were issued without considering the carve-out that cases which couldn't be reopened earlier couldn't be reassessed under the new law.The Supreme Court invoked its extraordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution on May 4, 2022, to uphold all reassessment notices issued after March 31, 2021. However, the court left room for judicial proceedings based on the merits of each case, and several such matters are currently pending before the court.","The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month.

Latest NPS rules, news: In the Union Budget 2024 speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced two new initiatives with regard to National Pension Scheme (NPS) - extension of NPS 14% employer contribution benefits to private setcor and the intended launch of NPS Vatsalya.Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries, bringing it at par with the provisions available for government employees.Sriram Iyer, CEO, HDFC Pension Management told ET that with this move the “ground rules have been harmonised among government and non-government employees, which is a positive step.”Effectively, this means that now, private-sector employees can choose to reduce the taxable portion of employers’ contribution to their NPS corpus, thereby paying less tax and leaving greater funds in their pension deposits.“Employees will benefit from tax savings . More importantly, the 40% increase in contribution will have a significant impact on the terminal value of the retirement corpus,” remarked Iyer. The extended savings will “help in retirement planning, working as an option that is at par with the Provident Fund,” Dinesh Rohira, CEO & Founder, 5nance.com was quoted as saying.Moreover, the endeavour aims to increase NPS penetration by increasing tax incentives for the private sector, providing them a social security-cushion post-retirement.The scheme’s motive to widen the NPS subscriber base may not prove to be flawlessly effective, however. This is explained by Agrees Mrin Agarwal, Founder, Finsafe India: “While it’s good that the limit has been raised, it may not increase adoption as employees need to be educated in a big way. Also, the benefit is only for the salaried opting for the new tax regime,” she says.The mandatory contribution to the EPF, too, threatens to relegate the provisions of NPS under the umbrella of near-superfluity. This sentiment is echoed by Varun Sahay, a software engineer in a Delhi-based IT company: “When 12% of my salary is already deducted for the EPF, why should I put in more in the NPS and cut my take-home pay?”Rohira feels otherwise. “There’s no competition between the NPS and EPF as employees can contribute to both and build a 3-4 times bigger corpus while earning 3-4% higher returns via marketlinked options in the NPS,” he counters.Also Check | New Tax Regime 2023 vs 2024 After Budget: How Much Income Tax Will Salaried Taxpayers Save & How Do New Tax Slabs Compare To Old Regime? Top 10 Points You Must Know To jumpstart retirement savings for children, a new initiative called NPS Vatsalya has been unveiled in the Budget. This scheme allows parents and guardians to contribute to a minor's account, which can be converted into a regular NPS account once the child reaches adulthood.""It provides a very long duration for reaping the compounding benefits and accumulating a huge bounty at a later age. This can be a good way to plan a better future for kids who may not opt for a service segment in the future,"" says Rohira. Sriram Iyer agrees, stating, ""It’s a good move to help the child start his retirement journey. Even if a parent starts when the child is 10 years old, by the time he starts working, it can be a solid foundation for the compounding journey after that.""However, some experts question the utility of a product with such a long lock-in period, especially when parents cannot use the funds for essential goals like their child’s education amidst soaring education costs of 11-12%.""Parents are struggling to save for their own retirement, so it might be a bit of a stretch to expect them to save for their kids’ retirement. The need of the hour is a market-linked product that allows withdrawals only for the child’s education,"" says Mrin Agarwal, Founder of Finsafe India.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? Though the NPS permits partial withdrawals, it allows only 25% of the corpus after three years of joining, and this can be done only three times during the entire tenure. A premature exit before 60 years with 100% withdrawal is only possible if the corpus is less than Rs.2.5 lakh, an amount insufficient for most children's goals.""In its current form, there won’t be any uptake,"" asserts Agarwal. Rohira concurs, ""It’s a vanilla product with a lock-in, which does not make it very attractive and it may not take off. However, the government may optimise it and introduce new features later."" Iyer adds, ""This is just a start and there may be more subscriber-friendly features as we take it to the market. The regulator is proactive and open to feedback.""","Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries.

Gold import duty cut: Why Indians may not find buying gold from Dubai as attractive post Budget 2024,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-import-duty-cut-why-indians-may-not-find-buying-gold-from-dubai-as-attractive-post-budget-2024/articleshow/112097671.cms,"Gold import duty cut: Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group, estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India.

Gold import duty cut in Budget 2024: The recent reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai. Indian jewellers with stores in both India and the UAE believe that the narrowed duty differential will result in lower gold prices in India, making it less attractive for Indians to purchase gold in Dubai.The emirate had attracted gold-enthusiast Indians following a steep rise in customs duty in India in July 2022. In the fiscal 2024-25 budget, the duty on gold imports was more than halved.The duty cut is also expected to boost gold jewellery production in India, particularly the popular 'Kolkatti' jewellery from Kolkata, which is favored by Indian expats in Dubai and tourists from various countries. This move will encourage gold artisans to create new designs in both heavyweight and lightweight jewellery, attracting consumers to purchase gold from India.According to an ET report, Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group , estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India as Indian tourists who previously bought jewellery in Dubai will now prefer to shop in India. However, Indian expats living in Dubai and other customers may continue to buy from the UAE.Also Read | Gold losing sheen? Government cuts gold bond issuance target as investors look at better alternatives Rajiv Popley, director at Popley & Sons, believes that the perception of overseas gold being cheaper than in India is merely a mindset. He points out that the labour cost is significantly lower in India, and with the introduction of mandatory hallmarking and HUID numbers, the purity of gold in India is no longer a concern.Furthermore, NRIs in Dubai do not receive VAT refunds, and Indians travelling abroad only receive about 60% of the VAT back on their gold purchases. Gold trade analyst Bhargav Baidya suggests that the 1% duty differential between gold jewellery in India and Dubai will be offset by Indian jewellers offering discounts to retain and attract customers.Saurabh Gadgil, chairman of PNG Jewellers, notes that Indian import duty is now on par with the US, allowing Indian jewellers to offer competitive prices compared to other countries worldwide. The reduced customs duty is expected to make gold purchases in India more attractive and convenient for Indian consumers, potentially leading to a significant shift in their gold shopping preferences.","The reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers.

Gold Bonds losing sheen

Gold losing sheen? The government has reduced its target for issuing gold bonds in the financial year 2024-25 by 38% compared to the previous interim budget goal, according to a senior official. The revised target stands at Rs 18,500 crore, down from Rs 29,638 crore estimated in the interim budget and Rs 26,852 crore (revised estimate) in 2023-24.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told ET ""The decision followed a reassessment of various factors, including investor demand, other investment products and uncertainties around the global economy, as the situation has changed since the interim budget in February.""After accounting for redemptions, the net issuances of sovereign gold bonds are now estimated at Rs 15,000 crore for this fiscal year, a significant decrease from the Rs 26,138 crore projected in the interim budget and Rs 25,352 crore in the revised estimate for 2023-24.Harish Galipelli, director at ILA Commodities India, attributed this shift to retail investors increasingly opting for equities in anticipation of better returns. He also noted that people are uncertain about the potential for further increases in gold prices in the short-to-medium term following a recent rally. Additionally, Galipelli pointed out that savings in rural areas have been impacted by retail inflation and other factors.The gold bond and gold monetisation schemes were introduced by the government in late 2015 to discourage the physical purchase of precious metals and reduce imports, thereby mitigating the negative impact on the current account deficit.The gross collection through these two schemes is now projected to be Rs 20,030 crore in 2024-25, compared to Rs 31,168 crore in the interim budget and Rs 28,240 crore (revised estimate) in the previous fiscal year. Similarly, the net collection is estimated at Rs 16,433 crore, down from Rs 27,571 crore in the interim budget and Rs 26,653 crore in the previous year. However, the estimates for the gold monetisation scheme remain unchanged from the interim budget level.Also Read | Budget 2024: Duty cuts on gold, silver, platinum, and diamonds to make jewellery more affordable The sovereign gold bond scheme targets investors who view gold as an investment, encouraging them to purchase paper gold instead of physical gold.On the other hand, the gold monetisation scheme aims to bring out idle gold held by households, temple trusts, and others to increase domestic supply. Both schemes were designed to curb gold imports, which, along with crude oil, have been significant contributors to India's current account deficit. Gold bond issuances had moderated after reaching Rs 16,049 crore during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020-21, before experiencing a surge in 2023-24.","The government has reduced its target for issuing gold bonds in the financial year 2024-25 by 38% compared to the previous interim budget goal.

Two-wheelers also had a similar story to tell.Sales of smartphones, from iPhones to Oppo, stayed strong as was the case with TV sets, with LG and Panasonic reporting good demand for premium, large-screen sizes. “Premiumisation continues to be the flavour of the season with growth coming in from large-screen 4K LED TVs, smart inverter ACs, and other smart appliances,” said Manish Sharma, chairman of Panasonic Life Solutions.Baljinder Singh, director of Unicorn Infosolutions, Apple’s largest premium retailer in India, said overall sales were seen to be growing 10% over last Dhanteras. “This may have been higher, but demand for the new iPhone 16 model has remained robust since its launch in Sept.”Tanishq, a leading organised retailer of jewellery, said footfalls started to build up as the day progressed and added that overall sales on Dhanteras appeared on course to surpass last year’s numbers, especially as the auspicious period stretches to around noon on Wednesday.“The festive season may have taken time to pick up, but it has been gathering pace over past few weeks. On Dhanteras, there has been a lot of interest in purchase of gold coins, jewellery and even diamond jewellery… we are confident to surpass what we did last year in terms of value,” Arun Narayan, VP (marketing & retail) at Tanishq told TOI.Dinesh Jain, MD, PM Shah group, that runs five gold and diamond stores in Mumbai and caters to budget buyers, said people are buying despite higher rates as they expect prices to risefurther. “But yes, there is focus on light-weight products when compared to last year due to higher prices.”Maruti Suzuki said car deliveries are at record levels. “Against the near 23,000 units that we sold on Dhanteras last year, we are looking to close with deliveries between 40,000 and 42,000 units this time.

Tata Motors’ MD for passenger vehicles and electric mobility Shailesh Chandra said while there has been a 30% growth in deliveries in Oct, Dhanteras has seen retail of around 15,000 vehicles.Footfalls increased as the day came to a close. “This will continue till late night.

Dhanteras delight: RBI says 102-ton gold shifted to India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/dhanteras-delight-rbi-says-102-ton-gold-shifted-to-india/articleshow/114751987.cms,"NEW DELHI: It is not just Indian households which look to bring gold into their lockers. On Dhanteras , the Reserve Bank of India disclosed that it has shipped another 102 tonnes of gold from Bank of England ’s vaults in London to secure locations within the country.At the end of September, of the 855 tonnes of yellow metal held by the Indian central bank, 510.5 tonnes was held domestically, the latest report on management of foreign exchange reserves revealed. Since Sept 2022, 214 tonnes have moved into the country as RBI and govt sought to secure their holdings amid heightened geopolitical tensions across the globe. Many in govt believe that it's safer to hold gold at home.On May 31, TOI was the first to report about 100 million tonnes being moved from the UK and had also said that a similar quantity was planned to be shipped again. The movement marked the first significant shift since gold moved out in early 1990s after govt was forced to pledge it amid a balance of payments crisis.Like the last time, RBI and govt undertook a secret mission involving special aircraft and detailed security arrangements to move the gold, acutely aware that the information should not leak out. The shipments also require an exemption from the levy of taxes. Authorities are not ruling out further movement although significant shipments are unlikely this year.Now, 324 tonnes are held in the safe custody of the Bank of England and the Bank for International Settlements, which also keeps the bulk of the precious metal in the UK. A little over 20 tonnes of RBI's holdings was kept in gold deposits.The Bank of England provides safe custody for the gold reserves of the UK and other central banks and is the second largest gold custodian after the New York Federal Reserve. The “bullion warehouse” — built in 1697 and subsequently expanded to deal with the gold rush from Brazil to Australia and from California to South Africa — holds around 4 lakh bars of gold. At the start of Sept, these vaults held nearly 5,350 tonnes (or around 17 crore fine troy ounces) of yellow metal.Quick liquidity given access to the London bullion market was cited as a key advantage of storing gold with the Bank of England. RBI data also revealed that RBI has increased its gold holdings, which at the end of Sept accounted for 9.3% of India’s foreign exchange reserves, compared with 8.1% in end-March.","Of the 855 tonnes of yellow metal held by the Indian central bank, 510.5 tonnes was held domestically.

"TMB looks at growth outside TN, says MD&CEO Nair",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tmb-looks-at-growth-outside-tn-says-mdceo-nair/articleshow/114743687.cms,"TMB MD & CEO Salee S Nair

You assumed charge as the new MD&CEO in August this year. What are your growth plans?

What are the other initiatives to enhance the efficiency of the bank?

TMB is a Tamil Nadu centric bank. What are your plans enhancing its footprint pan-India?

The bank has seen three MD&CEOs within a span of three calendar years (between CY2022 and CY2024)? Will it not have an adverse impact on the functioning of the bank?

CHENNAI: Tamilnad Mercantile Bank (TMB), which has 73% of its operations in the state, is looking to build its national footprint. In an interview to TOI, TMB MD & CEO Salee S Nair said 170 officers would be recruited outside Tamil Nadu for being accommodated in their respective state branches for local connect. Excerpts:In order to strengthen our branches on the deposits front, we are trying to get credit portfolio out off of the branches. We are setting up centralised Credit Management Centres (CMC). The CMCs will handle the entire credit portfolio except for gold loan, loan against deposit and some of the smaller government sponsored schemes. Each of our 12 regions will have one CMC and every CMC will cover about 50 branches. With the setting up of the CMCs, we hope to bring back our focus into other areas in the credit portfolio. Also, we are expecting that the bandwidth at the branch will substantially increase and this will be utilized for strengthening the deposit franchise. We have just started the process and this will take two quarters. We are hoping to have it by April 1, 2025.We have entered into a wage settlement agreement on Monday, which is aligned with the performance of the employees. According to the agreement, 21% employees fell under the fixed pay bracket, while 79% of the staff are under the Cost to Company (CTC) model with a significant variable component. And the variable component is aligned to the growth objectives of the bank. During the previous wage settlement agreement, 81% were in the fixed pay package model.About 27% of our branches are situated outside Tamil Nadu, where 24% of TMB's business is generated. Currently, TMB has 567 branches. In the last few years, we have not been growing up to the optimum. As a first step, we are absorbing local talent in different states, where they will be posted in their respective state branches for the local connect. About 170 officers are being recruited outside Tamil Nadu for the purpose. This would be mainly in the south Indian states and extending up to Maharashtra and Gujarat. So, effectively we can increase the share of business from outside Tamil Nadu to 40% over the next three years. The other area that we are looking at is setting up a global NRI centre , which is likely to come up in Kochi. At the same time, the number of our branches will increase by another 280 in the next three years.I think we can put the past behind us. And going forward, I think a certain amount of stability in the management is being brought in.","Tamilnad Mercantile Bank (TMB), which has 73% of its operations in the state, is looking to build its national footprint.

Also present were panchayat minister Pradip Majumdar and agriculture minister Shobhandeb Chatterjee. Sources close to the developments said the scheme would not only include two-wheeler owners and those whose homes were partly made of concrete — these categories are ineligible for PMAY — but also fast-track applications from elderly citizens, people with disabilities, women-headed households and people whose homes suffered damage during natural disasters, including Cyclone Dana.State govt is expected to roll out the scheme by Dec-end to an estimated 12 lakh citizens, the sources indicated. Beneficiaries would include those who applied for PMAY funds but have not received the grant.Bengal govt and Centre have been in a deadlock over the non-release of PMAY funds in the state. While Centre alleges a lack of background checks in applications, Bengal has questioned Centre's intent, alleging it has been stalling funds for 11.3 lakh beneficiaries. The sources indicated that Bengal govt had decided to release funds from its own resources for those who failed to procure the PMAY grant, like it has been doing with NREGS beneficiaries.After the CM's meeting, panchayat secretary P Ulganathan held a separate meeting with district officials apprising them about the rules. Sources said it was decided that the grants could cover both reconstruction of damaged houses and for building new units. Technical support will be provided to ensure the houses have adequate disaster-resistant features. Panchayat bodies would have to set up help desks to assist beneficiaries with documentation and technicalities.The new norms would also include special provisions for residents in coastal areas and flood-prone zones. Local panchayats are expected to play a crucial role in identifying genuine beneficiaries and facilitating the application process. BDOs have been directed to conduct regular field visits to assess the ground situation while selecting beneficiaries.State govt also plans to integrate the housing scheme with other welfare programmes to provide comprehensive support to affected families. Panchayats and police would be involved in the monitoring process to ensure transparency and timely completion of homes. Govt will also set up a grievance redress mechanism to address complaints and concerns promptly, an official said.The focus of the CM's meeting was to streamline norms to provide housing assistance to victims of recent natural calamities, an official said. During the meeting, she reviewed damage caused by Dana and recent floods, which left many families homeless across several districts. She also asked Majumdar and Chatterjee to visit the districts to assess the extent of the damage caused to crops and houses by the cyclone.

US job openings fell in September to a 3 1/2-year low,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-job-openings-fell-in-september-to-a-3-1/2-year-low/articleshow/114741663.cms,"Representative image

WASHINGTON: US job openings tumbled last month to their lowest level since January 2021, a sign that the labor market is losing some momentum. Still, posted vacancies remain well above pre-pandemic levels.The Labor Department reported Tuesday that the number of job openings dropped to 7.4 million in September from 7.9 million in August. Economists had expected the level of openings to be virtually unchanged. Job openings fell in particular at healthcare companies and at government agencies at the federal, state and local levels.The number of layoffs also rose. And the number of Americans who quit their jobs fell below 3.1 million, the fewest since August 2020.""Workers (are) not as confident as they have been about being able to find a job if they quit without another to step into,″ Carl Weinberg and Rubeela Farooqi of High Frequency Economics wrote in a commentary. Still, they added, ""there is no signal here of any sudden collapse of the labor market here or any imminent recession. The labor market is softer, sure, but it is not imploding.""Though job openings have fallen sharply since peaking at 12.2 million in 2022, they remain higher than they were before the coronavirus pandemic paralyzed the American economy in early 2020. When the economy roared back with unexpected strength from the COVID-19 recession, companies scrambled to find enough workers to keep up with customer orders.The overheating economy caused an outburst of inflation, and theFederal Reserve responded by raising its benchmark interest rate 11 times in 2022 and 2023. Inflation has plummeted from a peak of 9.1% in June 2022 to 2.4%.The economy proved surprisingly resilient in the face of the Fed hikes, dodging a widely forecast recession. Compared with a surge in hiring from 2021 through 2023, though, job creation has slowed this year - to an average of 200,000 new jobs a month from January through September this year. That is healthy though down from a record average of 604,000 jobs a month in 2021 at the end of pandemic lockdowns, 377,000 in 2022 and 251,000 last year.Still, employers did add an unexpectedly strong 254,000 jobs in September. On Friday, the Labor Department is expected to report that the economy added 120,000 jobs in October, a total that will likely be held down by the effects of Hurricanes Helene and Milton and a strike at Boeing. The unemployment rate is expected to remain at a low 4.1%, according to a survey of forecasters by the data firm FactSet.","The number of job openings dropped to 7.4 million in September from 7.9 million in August.

Investors are looking for the next big breakout stars as the cryptocurrency market prepares for a potential surge. Five cryptos , Rexas Finance , Sui , Chainlink , Solana , and Litecoin , are set to skyrocket this November. Smart investors should keep an eye on these coins as they exhibit indications of a notable increase in line with the current market momentum.Rexas Finance's novel approach to the real-world asset (RWA) tokenisation has garnered the project's rapid attention in the market. The project has achieved a significant milestone with $4 million raised in its Stage 4 presale. Real estate, artwork, and other tangible assets can be tokenized with Rexas Finance, releasing liquidity and giving investors access to illiquid markets.Rexas Finance has several important features, such as a no-code Token Builder that makes it easier to create NFTs and utility tokens and a QuickMint Bot that allows tokenization over major chat platforms instantly. Additionally, its AI Shield inspects smart contracts to improve security and ensure the platform's safety. Investor trust has increased after the platform's recent CoinMarketCap listing, which increased token performance transparency. The current $1 million giveaway adds to the enthusiasm surrounding Rexas Finance. Twenty winners will receive $50,000 worth of RXS apiece. As November approaches, investors will be closely watching the token price rise to $0.070 during the next presale stage, with a public launch listing price of $0.20.Sui's increasing Total Value Locked (TVL), which has risen by 260% since August and reached $1.49 billion, has helped it gain popularity. Sui's bullish channel pattern indicates that the token may see a 22.9% price surge to $2.6 as the cryptocurrency market continues to trend upward. Expectations of additional expansion have been fueled by the SUI Foundation's recent clarification on insider selling claims, further enhancing investor faith. Sui, now trading at $2.04, is set up for an upward breakout, making it a strong contender in November.Recent upgrades to the ecosystem have given Chainlink (LINK) a positive momentum and demonstrated tremendous potential. The introduction of Secure Mint, the growth of the data oracle, and the staking feature of LINK have all helped to drive up the price of the cryptocurrency, which is currently trading at $11.53. With increased on-chain activity and declining exchange reserves, the market is becoming more bullish, and the token may soon overcome its $13 resistance level. It could spark a surge to new highs in the upcoming weeks if LINK is able to break through current resistance.As it gets ready to introduce Firedancer, a new high-performance validator that will speed up the blockchain's transaction processing, Solana (SOL) has continued to develop steadily. Solana has gained 2% as of late, trading at $153.82, as the community excitedly awaits the mainnet launch in early 2025. Momentum indications point to a potential gain of around 11% for SOL, with the $169.43 resistance level as the goal. The ecology and long-term profit potential of the Solv Protocol is further strengthened by the recent introduction of its Bitcoin staking token on Solana.Recently, Litecoin (LTC) broke all previous records by having its intraday trading volume hit $4 billion for the first time in 16 months. LTC's price has surged beyond $70, indicating significant purchasing demand. With a market capitalization of $5.45 billion, Litecoin has risen more than 10% in the previous week thanks to the wider crypto movement and growing acceptance by world payment networks. Analysts expect LTC to keep rising near the $100 threshold; hence, this coin is important to watch this November.November is already proving to be an interesting month for investors, with these five cryptocurrencies exhibiting clear indications of rapid growth. Particularly noteworthy is Rexas Finance, with its cutting-edge technology and quickly expanding business. Don't pass up this opportunity to participate in the Rexas Finance presale and help shape the future of cryptocurrency!","Five cryptos, Rexas Finance, Sui, Chainlink, Solana, and Litecoin, are set to skyrocket this November.

Oil giant BP reports drop in third-quarter net profit,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/oil-giant-bp-reports-drop-in-third-quarter-net-profit/articleshow/114728059.cms,"Britain's BP on Tuesday announced a sharp fall in net profit for the third quarter, with the oil and gas giant hit by weak oil trading and refining margins .Profit after taxation slumped to $206 million in the three months to September, after a net profit of $4.9 billion in the same period in 2023, BP said in a results statement.The group earlier this month flagged to markets that its latest earnings would take a sizeable hit after oil prices have fallen on concerns over Chinese demand and the prospect of higher crude production in 2025.The company's underlying replacement cost profit excluding exceptional items -- a measure of operating earnings -- came in at $2.3 billion, down more than $1 billion from a year earlier.Total revenue dropped around 11 percent to $48.3 billion.Energy majors have also been impacted by declining gas prices, which have fallen heavily since soaring after the invasion of Ukraine by major energy producer Russia in early 2022.""In oil and gas, we see the potential to grow through the decade with a focus on value over volume,"" chief executive Murray Auchincloss said in an earnings statement.Looking to the fourth quarter, the company said it expects to report lower upstream production and lower volumes, and for refining margins to remain low.Despite the results beating analysts expectations, shares in the company dropped around one percent in morning deals on the news.""Refining margins continue to be a thorn in BP's side,"" said Derren Nathan, head of equity research at Hargreaves Lansdown.The oil giant is ""holding its nerve"" by upping its dividend payment and releasing another $1.75 billion to buy back more shares, he added.- Oil prices -Global oil demand has been weighed down in recent months by an economic slowdown in China, the world's largest importer of crude.""The uncertain economic backdrop, including growth concerns for China, continue to offer uncertainty over future energy demand and usage"", said Keith Bowman, equity analyst at Interactive Investor.However, oil prices soared in early October on escalating tensions in the Middle East, particularly between Israel and Iran, which drove concerns about supply from the region.Prices have since eased again after Israel came under international pressure not to strike Iranian oil installations and concerns around Chinese demand reignited.Under the new CEO Auchincloss, who took up the role in January, BP has said it will focus more on oil and gas to raise profits and has walked away from various climate commitments -- a strategy also taken up by its rival Shell.Earlier this year, BP gave the green light to the Kaskida oil project in the US Gulf of Mexico, the group's sixth hub in the area, with production set to begin in 2029.Shell will report its third-quarter earnings on Thursday, after it too warned of lower refining margins.",Britain's BP announces a sharp fall in net profit for the third quarter.

Taiwan attempts to join IMF to achieve financial protection from China,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/taiwan-attempts-to-join-imf-to-achieve-financial-protection-from-china/articleshow/114629473.cms,"Taiwan, an economy comparable to Poland yet excluded from global organizations, is attempting to join the International Monetary Fund (IMF), a 190-country organization that provides emergency loans and other financial assistance to its members.""Taiwan's membership in the IMF would enhance financial resilience,"" stated the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in Washington during this week's IMF and World Bank annual meetings. This office acts as Taiwan's de facto embassy in the US.In a bid to enhance its global status, Taiwan is also seeking to participate in the UN World Health Organization's annual World Health Assembly and join Interpol. The United States and its allies support Taiwan's initiatives.However, China views Taiwan as a breakaway province and has threatened to annex it by force, blocking such initiatives and insisting on representing Taiwan in international forums. Consequently, the island is referred to as ""Taiwan Province of China"" in IMF literature.Four years ago, in 2020, then-President Donald Trump had signed legislation that established US policy to support Taiwan's membership or observer status in international organizations like the IMF.The US State Department said the world ""stands to benefit from Taiwan's expertise and resources to address some of today's most difficult global challenges,"" and said it will continue to support Taiwan's membership in international organizations where statehood is not required and encourage Taiwan's meaningful participation in groups where its membership is not possible.The IMF has responded to Taiwan's efforts to gain membership. While the United States holds the most influence within the organization, China also wields significant power, possessing more voting weight than any country except the United States and Japan.Bo Li, who had worked as vice governor of the People's Bank of China, now serves as the IMF's deputy managing director.The proposal for Taiwan to join the IMF aims to safeguard the democratically governed island from potential financial attacks by China, which is intent on seizing Taiwan, even if it requires the use of force.While Washington is worried over a military conflict in the Taiwan Strait, analysts and observers have raised concerns that Beijing could wage an economic and cyber war to force a surrender from Taiwan.In a report this month, the research group Taiwan Academy of Banking and Finance cautioned that China might attempt to destabilize the Taiwanese currency by making significant bets against Taiwan's stock market and manipulating foreign exchange markets. Joining the IMF would provide Taiwan access to a rainy-day fund that it could use for self-defense.The US House has approved a bill that would direct the United States to advocate for Taiwan's IMF membership. The legislation reflects growing concern from Republicans and Democrats alike over Beijing's rising threats to Taiwan, an island critical to the global supply of computer chips.North Carolina Republican and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, Patrick McHenry, argued that the United States needed to look beyond Beijing's military threats and help Taiwan defend itself financially.""As one of the world's most advanced and innovative economies, Taiwan should be included under the fund's activities,"" McHenry said.Although Taiwan lacks a seat at the United Nations , Young Kim, a Republican from California, has pointed out that Kosovo, located in southeastern Europe, is a member of the IMF despite not being recognized by the UN.",Taiwan's membership in the IMF would enhance financial resilience. China views Taiwan as a breakaway province and has threatened to annex it by force.
