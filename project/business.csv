New Income Tax Regime Vs Old Income Tax Regime 2024-25: Selecting the most tax-efficient income tax regime, either the old or new, can be a challenging decision for many salaried taxpayers. April is the first month of the new financial year, and employers would have asked salaried individuals to share their choice of preferred income tax regime for the purpose of TDS.One must remember that the new income tax regime is now the default tax regime and in case you don’t tell your employer your chosen tax regime, your TDS will be deducted as per the new tax regime. If at the time of filing your tax return you want to switch regimes, you can, provided the ITR is filed within the due date provided by the Income Tax Department.New Vs Old Tax Regime: Understanding the break-evenThe optimal choice between the new income tax regime and the old income tax regime depends on the amount of deductions that can be claimed from gross total income to reduce taxable income. If taxpayers are aware of their gross total income and the minimum deductions required to pay the same tax under both regimes, the decision becomes more straightforward.When the claimable deductions exceed this minimum amount, the old tax regime proves more beneficial, while the new tax regime saves more tax if the deductions fall below this threshold, explains an ET analysis.It is crucial to note that the minimum deductions necessary to equalize the tax outgo in both regimes vary based on the income level. The table provided below as part of an ET analysis illustrates the minimum deduction amounts that individuals at different gross taxable income levels must claim to achieve equal income tax payable, also known as their break-even level of deductions.From the table above, it can be seen that once the income crosses the threshold of Rs 15.5 lakh, the maximum deduction of Rs 4.25 lakh remains constant. This is because the income tax rate of 30% remains constant after income crosses Rs 15 lakh in the new tax regime. Under the old tax regime, the income tax rate of 30% becomes constant once income exceeds Rs 10 lakh. Do remember that surcharges are levied when taxable income exceeds Rs 50 lakh. Hence, for those incomes, the minimum deduction amount will vary.Also Read | New Vs Old Tax Regime: How income of even Rs 10 lakh can be tax-free under old tax regime The table is specifically designed for salaried individuals who can benefit from a standard deduction of Rs 50,000 from salary income in both tax regimes. The deduction available on the employer's contribution to NPS has not been considered when determining the break-even or minimum deduction amount. If a salaried individual claims this deduction in both regimes, the break-even or minimum deduction amount will be lower.",New Vs Old Tax Regime: Understanding the break-even.

Insolvency Proceedings: Subhash Chandra Faces Insolvency Proceedings,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/subhash-chandra-faces-insolvency-proceedings/articleshow/109512434.cms,"NEW DELHI: The National Company Law Tribunal ( NCLT ) on Monday admitted a petition filed by Indiabulls Housing Finance and directed initiation of personal insolvency proceedings against Subhash Chandra , the founder-chairman emeritus of Zee Entertainment Enterprises.Chandra had given a personal guarantee of around Rs 170 crore to a group entity Vivek Infracon and Indiabulls Housing Finance had moved NCLT for a default that took place in 2022.Chandra had challenged the move, arguing NCLT did not have powers.Following discussion around a settlement, the case was withdrawn from the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT). Subsequently, the terms of the agreement were allegedly not met, resulting in Indiabulls Housing Finance approaching the tribunal (NCLT) once again for action under section 95 of the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code (IBC). The move also followed last year’s Supreme Court ruling, which upheld the validity of provisions related to personal insolvency in IBC.The apex court ruling has opened the floodgates for creditors to initiate action against a host of corporate chiefs even in cases where they have not been able to recover the full amount in corporate insolvency cases. On Monday, NCLT pronounced the order, but a detailed judgment is awaited. It, however, rejected pleas filed by two other creditors, IDBI Trusteeship and Axis Bank.“The copy of the order is awaited. Appropriate steps will be actioned in accordance with the applicable law,” says a statement from office of Chandra. Chandra can appeal against the order in the appellate tribunal (NCLAT).Unlike a corporate insolvency resolution process, where the promoters are ousted and a resolution professional takes charge, along with a committee of creditors, personal insolvency proceedings work differently. As a first step, NCLT will appoint a resolution professional.Once an application is admitted, there is a moratorium, when every legal action or proceeding pending in respect of any debt owed by the personal guarantor is deemed to have been stayed. Once claims are received from creditors, the personal guarantor prepares a repayment plan, along with the resolution professional, which may involve restructuring of loans or transfer or sale of some assets. So far, progress on personal insolvency cases has been slow.","Chandra had given a personal guarantee of around Rs 170 crore to a group entity Vivek Infracon.

"No more OTP frauds? Home Ministry teams up with SBI Cards, telecom operators for innovative solution on stolen one-time passwords",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/no-more-otp-frauds-home-ministry-teams-up-with-sbi-cards-telecom-operators-for-innovative-solution-on-stolen-one-time-passwords/articleshow/109524380.cms,"Crooks on the prowl

No more OTP frauds? India's home ministry, SBI Cards and Payment Services Ltd (SBI Card), and telecom operators are collaborating to create a solution that will alert customers about stolen one-time passwords (OTPs) as part of a larger initiative to address the increasing risk of cyber fraud and phishing attacks on the banking system.According to two individuals familiar with the matter, the government is evaluating a solution that will enable banks to monitor a customer's registered address and the geolocation where an OTP is being delivered.If there is a discrepancy between the two locations, the customer can be notified of a potential phishing attempt, said an ET report. The solution is currently in the testing phase, and the goal is to use the telecom database to track the customer's geolocation and ensure that the OTP is being sent to the correct location.The Reserve Bank of India had advocated for an additional factor of authentication for any digital payment transaction primarily to prevent fraud. However, over time, fraudsters have developed sophisticated capabilities to either steal OTPs by deceiving unsuspecting bank customers or redirect OTPs to their own devices through fraudulent means, rendering the second factor of authentication ineffective in combating cybercrime.If there is a problem with the OTP delivery location, two steps can be taken: either an alert can be displayed on the device, or the OTP can be blocked entirely. While the specifics of the solution are still being developed with telecom companies, a customer's SIM location can be verified in real-time and compared to the geolocation of OTP delivery. Banks also have their own data on customers' residences, so capabilities will need to be developed to triangulate the data in real-time.Also Read | Getting wrong calls from loan recovery agents, unable to link number with bank account? You may have got a recycled mobile number “For instance, the customer lives in Bengaluru and the OTP is getting delivered in some place in Uttar Pradesh where the person has never been or from where the person has not made any calls recently, which means he or she is not traveling to that place; this is a typical red flag scenario,” a banker said.According to the Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (i4C), cyber criminals siphoned off as much as Rs 10,319 crore between April 2021 and December 2023. The majority of the crimes originated in China, Cambodia, and Myanmar and involved non-state actors. Under i4C, the government established the 'Citizen Financial Cyber Fraud Reporting and Management System', which has prevented approximately Rs 1,200 crore in fraudulent transfers from more than 470,000 citizen complaints received until February 2024. In the calendar year 2023, the registry received 1.12 million complaints totaling Rs 7,488 crore in fraudulent transfers.","India's home ministry, SBI Cards and Payment Services Ltd (SBI Card), and telecom operators are collaborating to create a solution that will alert customers about stolen one-time passwords.

"Now, airlines to ensure kids below 12 are seated with at least one parent or guardian without extra charge",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/now-airlines-to-ensure-kids-below-12-are-seated-with-at-least-one-parent-or-guardian-without-extra-charge/articleshow/109522491.cms,"NEW DELHI: Airlines will now have to ensure that young children are seated with at least one of their parents or guardians on flights without being required to pay extra for seat selection charge if travelling on the same PNR (booking reference). Following numerous complaints from passengers travelling in groups about being seated separately — especially from their children — if they choose not to pay extra for seat selection, the DGCA on Tuesday issued a directive to airlines on this issue.“Airlines shall ensure that children upto the age of 12 years are allocated seats with at least one of their parents/guardians, who are travelling on the same PNR and a record of the same shall be maintained,” says an amended rule by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA).The regulator’s Air Transport Circular (ATC)-01 of 2024 titled “unbundle of services and fees by scheduled airlines” allows airlines to charge extra for services like zero baggage, preferential seating , meals, snacks, beverages, and carriage of musical instruments. On an opt-in basis, passengers can choose to pay for these extra services if they desire to do so.“Such unbundled services are provided on ‘opt-in’ basis by airlines and are not mandatory. There is also a provision for auto seat assignment to passengers who have not selected any seat for web check-in before scheduled departure. In view of the various instances that came to the notice of DGCA wherein children below the age of 12 years were not seated along with their parent/guardian, the existing Air Transport Circular 01 of 2021 has been suitably modified,” a senior official said.The issue of people travelling in groups being seated separately if they do not pay extra for seat selection has been irking travellers across the world and not just in India. The US, for instance, has been grappling with this issue.US President Joe Biden had on Feb 5, 2023, said on X (former Twitter): “Some airlines charge extra to pick your seat, including for parents who want to sit next to their child on a plane. Congress should pass the Junk Fee Protection Act so we can crack down on these fees and give hard-working Americans just a little bit more breathing room.” Then on March 1, 2023, US department of transport secretary tweeted: “Next week,(the department) will publish afamily seating dashboard to show which airlines guarantee families can sit together for free. I appreciate American Airlines becoming the first US airline to commit to putting this guarantee in its customer service plan.” In response, President Biden Tweeted: “I called for airlines to eliminate family seating fees in my State of the Union – and today, American Air announced they're doing just that. No one should have to pay extra to be seated with their kids. Time for more airlines to follow suit.”Airlines globally, including in India, offer pre-seat selection for a charge and those who do not wish to pay this get allocated whatever seats were not pre-booked. As a result, groups or families travelling together are mostly seated separately on flights if they do not book their seats in advance by paying extra.",Airlines will now have to ensure that young children are seated with at least one of their parents or guardians on flights without being required to pay extra for seat selection charge if travelling on the same PNR.

Concerns on debt and capex



Reliance Industries share price today: Reliance Industries ( RIL ), led by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, on Monday announced its quarterly earnings for the January to March period. After the release of these results, several brokerages have raised their target prices for the company's stock.As per an ET report by Nikhil Agarwal, the boost in target prices was influenced by positive remarks from RIL's management regarding moderation of capital expenditures ( capex ) and the possibility of increased telecom tariffs .The question now is: Is it time to buy RIL shares?RIL's stock has seen a 14% increase this calendar year, but was trading flat on Tuesday morning after the earnings release. However, brokerages are showing optimism, with several increasing their target prices to up to Rs 3,500.The global brokerage firm Jefferies has raised its target price for Reliance Industries (RIL) from Rs 3,140 to Rs 3,380, expecting a 14% EBITDA growth in FY25, largely driven by Jio's expected tariff hike.UBS has set a target price of Rs 3,420 for RIL, suggesting that retail business sales will grow in the near term due to increased sales per square foot from new stores opened in the last two years.Macquarie has kept a neutral outlook on RIL but has raised its target price from Rs 2,560 to Rs 2,630. Morgan Stanley, meanwhile, has maintained a positive outlook with a target price of Rs 3,046.Bank of America (BoFA) has a target price of Rs 3,250, while Bernstein's target price is Rs 3,160.Domestic brokerage Nuvama has set the highest target price for Reliance Industries (RIL) at Rs 3,500. They believe that RIL's new energy projects will drive the company's next phase of growth while supporting its traditional businesses. Reliance Retail 's year-on-year growth was only 11%, the slowest in three years, mainly due to store restructuring and a higher baseline.According to Equirus Securities, the ongoing decline in discretionary spending worsened the situation. However, Reliance Industries maintained a solid operating margin of 7.4% in the recent quarter. Although they expect this weakness to continue in the near term, Reliance Retail has significant potential in the Indian market. Equirus predicts that the company will achieve a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13% in revenue and 16% in EBITDA between FY24 and FY27.Analysts believe that worries about Reliance Industries' debt are exaggerated, as they expect the company's net debt to decrease gradually. This is because capital expenditures (capex) are set to moderate, and the funding for capex will come from an increase in internal cash generation.","Reliance Industries ( RIL ), led by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, on Monday announced its quarterly earnings for the January to March period.

It, however, added that conditions are shaping up for an extension of a trend upshift in real GDP growth, backed by strong investment demand and upbeat business and consumer sentiments.The report warns of climate risks, such as an increase in above-normal heatwave days across India. The report suggests monitoring of food prices, as overlapping price shocks could occur before an above-normal monsoon this year, as projected by the India Meteorological Department (IMD).The report states that to achieve India's developmental goals over the next three decades, the economy must grow at 8-10% annually to take advantage of the demographic dividend that started accruing in 2018 and will persist until 2055. ""Conditions are shaping up for an extension of the trend upshift that took the average real GDP growth above 8% during 2021-24,"" the report said.According to govt data, the economy grew at 8.4% from Oct-Dec - its fastest pace in a year and a half. This resulted in three consecutive quarters of growth over 8%. Several agencies have raised their growth estimates for India on the back of a stellar Dec quarter performance.The prediction of a normal monsoon augurs well for inflation in the months ahead, although prices of some food items including vegetables pose a risk. RBI governor Shaktikanta Das had said that inflation has come down significantly but remained above the 4% target and food inflation continues to exhibit considerable volatility impeding the ongoing disinflation process. He had also said that high and persistent food inflation could unhinge anchoring of inflation expectations which is underway.The report said that the current growth trajectory is powered primarily by capital deepening, fuelled by sustained public investment, and supported by productivity improvements. It also quotes the Asian Development Bank (ADB), highlighting a renewed increase in private investment. The report aligns with the MPC observation, which expects private consumption to increase as rural activity picks up and urban demand remains steady due to improving consumer confidence.","Extreme weather events may pose a risk to inflation along with prolonged geopolitical tensions that could keep crude oil prices volatile.

French Barrier: Indian Cos Face French Barrier For Generic Deal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/indian-companies-face-french-barrier-for-generic-deal/articleshow/109543659.cms,"NEW DELHI: You can call it a Swadeshi spirit in French style. The French government is planning to block the sale of generic drugs firm Biogaran to potential foreign bidders, which include two Indian pharma companies, according to French media reports.Torrent Pharmaceuticals and Aurobindo Pharma have emerged as potential bidders, along with other entities, including a foreign PE firm, industry sources told TOI.The French industry minister Roland Lescure has been pretty vocal recently, reports say, about his government’s decision to block the sale, indicating a thorough examination of all bids. The French government has cited reasons, including safeguarding the pharma company’s critical supply chain as well as national interest. Emails sent by TOI to Torrent and Aurobindo went unanswered.Biogaran, founded in 1996 with primarily generic drugs, has added biosimilars and OTC medicines and markets its drugs in Africa, Europe and Latin America, according to its website.Further, Biogaran is one of the first companies to have invested in the development of biosimilar drugs and launched its first biosimilar drug in February 2015. Its parent Servier is focusing on innovative treatment, including oncology, and has not made a final decision on the sale, amid govt scrutiny, media reports say. Servier Group’s consolidated revenue for 2022-23 (year ending September 30, 2023) increased by 9.2% to 5.3 billion euro compared to 2021-2022.The company was put on the block at the end of 2023. No commercial offer has been made, while Servier has not officially confirmed the information as yet, according to French media. Pharmaceuticals are considered of strategic importance in France, while the issue of Europe’s pharmaceutical sovereignty has been a subject of raging debate, particularly in the wake of the Covid crisis and recent drug shortages.This incident however does not sound entirely new for India. In the past, Indian govt has blocked hostile takeovers by UK-based NRI businessman Swaraj Paul for Escorts and DCM Shriram and global tobacco maker BAT’s bid for ITC.In 2020, govt tweaked FDI policy mandating that all investments from neighbouring countries, including China, would now require Centre’s approval. This effectively closed the “automatic route” for these nations, including blocking potential investments from China.

Bose pressed charges of cheating, criminal intimidation, conspiracy and harassment. Bose was sacked from the top post in May 2022 by the Singapore-based B2B fashion startup over alleged financial irregularities.In her six-page complaint, which was reviewed by TOI, Bose alleged that Kapoor and Vaidya misled her and the company’s investors in an attempt to gain financial advantages and coerced her into relinquishing her shares and business under false pretences.This behaviour, Bose said, had been ongoing from April 2020 through 2022.“As the chief operating officer, Aadi Vaidya engaged in misconduct by falsely attributing loss-making deals to me and extending trade credit to various parties in my name. He then used those deals to threaten me by falsely implicating me to investors, despite the fact that all operational dealings were conducted by him in my previous company. I have been threatened, deceived, and had errors attributed to me in order for Vaidya to fraudulently acquire my shares, which are valued at multiple crores,” Bose said, adding that Kapoor and Vaidya chose to be “sneaky and shady” by hiding various company-related data and information.“This made it extremely difficult to make informed decisions and collaborate effectively. Additionally, both Kapoor and Vaidya intentionally did not attend the Kroll meetings, which further complicated matters for me and disrupted the other team members,” Bose said.Zilingo had appointed Kroll and Deloitte for forensic audit to investigate the complaints received by the company against Bose. Kapoor and Vaidya didn’t respond to messages. Law firm Singhania & Co, representing Bose, confirmed the development. Bose, who co-founded Zilingo with Kapoor in 2015, was one of the most celebrated startup founders. Prior to her dismissal as CEO, the board placed her under suspension when it appointed an independent forensics firm to look into the alleged financial irregularities.",Ankiti Bose filed a criminal complaint against fellow co-founder Dhruv Kapoor and ex-COO Aadi Vaidya.

The finance minister set the stage for a ""Viksit Bharat by 2047"", on the core principles of ‘Sabka Saath’, ‘Sabka Vikas’, ‘Sabka Vishwas’, with ‘Sabka Prayas’ being added as a new theme in the interim Budget.This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data i.e., farmer welfare and N for Nari utthan i.e., support for women entrepreneurs.These form the pillars of a comprehensive inclusive development. The Government's commitment to sustainable development under the strategy for Amrit Kaal includes achieving 'Net Zero' by 2070, rooftop solarization for one crore households and robust health initiatives.The Indian economy's resilience takes center stage amidst positive indicators of declining current account deficit as a percentage of GDP, falling unemployment rates, and a notable rise in digital transactions. These statistics affirm the robustness of the economy, showcasing a trajectory of growth and stability.The achievements in taxation reforms are nothing short of remarkable, with direct tax collections more than trebling in the last decade, the number of tax return filers increasing by 2.4 times, average processing time of tax returns plummeting from 93 days in FY 2013-14 to an impressive 10 days in FY 2023-24, resulting in issuance of quick refunds. These are the results of consistent progressive measures thus obviating the need for, and rightly avoiding, any last-minute populist measures.No change in existing tax rates, both for direct and indirect taxes, is a good indicator of stability and predictability for investors and taxpayers.A welcome move to waive outstanding tax demands that are minor, disputed, and unreconciled. This involves the withdrawal of outstanding direct tax demands up to Rs. 25,000 pertaining to the period up to FY 2009-10 and up to Rs.10,000 for FY 2010-11 to 2014-15.The Government's commitment to fostering a business-friendly environment is evident in its intent to extend specific tax benefits for start-ups, investments by sovereign wealth funds/ pension funds, and certain IFSC units. The extension has been made now until March 31, 2025. This might help in creating a conducive landscape for business.To align with the CBDT notification issued earlier, the provisions relating to tax collection at source concerning remittances under the Liberalized Remittance Scheme have now been formally incorporated in the Finance Bill, 2024, setting the rate at 20% for amounts exceeding Rs. 7 lakhs in a financial year.The Finance Bill, 2024 proposes an extension of the time limit for introducing the faceless scheme by the Central Government for transfer pricing proceedings, DRP Proceedings, and ITAT Proceedings, up to March 31, 2025.The interim Budget 2024 may not have proposed significant tax announcements, but it very well positioned the prelude to the full budget post the upcoming elections. Considering the potential impact on the population across the four pillars of GYAN, a sizable portion of India stands to be covered. The interim Budget’s focus on the tax front resembles a report card, highlighting the maturity achieved by our tax system. The enhancement of taxpayer services was emphasized as a key priority.","This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data and N for Nari utthan.

Interim Budget for a Viksit Bharat: It’s for everyone and all,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/interim-budget-for-a-viksit-bharat-its-for-everyone-and-all/articleshow/107497439.cms,"By Akhilesh Tuteja

The Finance Minister on February 01, 2024, delivered a truly innovative interim budget. At first glance, it did not seem like an interim budget but looked more like the budget to drive further growth and a continuum of inclusive growth-oriented investments.At the outset, this budget brings a wonderful balance between fiscal prudence and continued investment for growth.It's not easy to continue the glide path of reducing the fiscal deficit and continuing to make significant investments in all areas including infrastructure, R&D, energy transition, technology, skilling, and social welfare. The surprising reduction in fiscal deficit of 5.8% as against the budgeted 5.9% for FY24 and the projection of 5.1% in FY25 with a clear focus on increasing investments was a huge positive.This was a budget for everyone and all because it caters to every part of the Indian economy and society. The FM has carefully catered to the investment needs of various sectors. The continued focus on youth, impoverished, women and farmers to increase their involvement and contribution to economic growth is evident. By committing an 11.1% increase in capital expenditure to 11,11,111 lakh crore, the FM has clearly brought every single 1 in this growth journey.What was very impressive was the inclusion strategy of the government. The focus on women's empowerment for the past few years is unprecedented, which is reflected in the inclusion of women in the workforce moving from 23.3% to 37% in the last five years. The thirty crore Mudra Yojna loans to women entrepreneurs were a great boost to the Nari Shakti initiative. We already have over 10 million Lakhpati Didis and what is truly evident is like a corporate CFO, the FM has revised the earlier target of 20 million Lakhpati Didis to 30 million. The government also plans to invest in initiatives to encourage young girls between the ages of 9 and 14 to undertake the vaccination for cervical cancer which is again a great boost to Nari Shakti.A lot needs to be done to bring more women into all parts of economic growth but the journey so far and the vision of the future is truly inspiring.While India continues on its technological prowess and makes its mark in new technologies like Artificial Intelligence, we need a multi-pronged strategy to harness the power of AI. We need a clear focus on building AI systems in India so that we not only emerge as a global leader in this new era but can build models, which are specific to India that will benefit Indians. At the same time, we need a very wide coverage program to build skills to leverage AI to its fullest potential. The biggest contribution we can make to the inclusion of youth in the economic development of the country is by skilling them in new skill areas. In the last few years, the Skill India Mission has trained 14 million youth, reskilled over 5 million youth and established a staggering 3,000 new ITIs. The future of any country will depend as much on capital investments as on skill investments.The focus on agricultural development and support to the farmer continues through direct financial assistance to farmers. The farmers have benefited by getting crop insurance through PM Fasal Bima Yojana. It's not just the farmers, the PM-SVANidhi provides credit assistance to a large number of street vendors.The last few years have seen the journey of affordable housing through Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY). There is a slight increase in allocation to launch a scheme for encouraging the middle class to build or buy new homes. This investment will likely propel a wider economic development and increase employment.India has seen a tremendous rise in entrepreneurship in the last few years. In order to continue the journey and promote new startups, the government proposes to extend certain tax benefits, which are expiring from March 2024 to March 2025. The MSMEs have not been left behind. With a proposal to provide timely finances to such enterprises, the government has paved the way for their growth, so they can look to compete globally.All in all, it’s a truly inclusive budget with a clear focus on development not just by giving away freebies but enabling the people to participate in the economic development activity. While the FM calls the comprehensive GDP - Governance, Development & Performance – to me, this budget is inclusive of another GDP – gender, demography, and professions.","Akhilesh Tuteja is Partner and Head, Clients and Markets, KPMG in India.

‘Enough domestic sources of demand to counter drag from external sector’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/enough-domestic-sources-of-demand-to-counter-drag-from-external-sector/articleshow/107372012.cms,"Do you think the

creates room for lower interest rates?

One of the issues that the Budget has flagged is the demographic challenge and opportunity and the societal change that is taking place. How do you view this?

Niti Aayog is working on the Viksit Bharat roadmap. What will be the focus areas?

You are as much a representative of the Centre as well as the states. Is it time to revisit the entire formula for transfers to states particularly on the issue of cesses and surcharges?

Suman Bery , who heads Niti Aayog , the govt think tank, is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China, which he says is also an opportunity for India. The economist is confident that Indian states remain resilient. Excerpts of the interview with TOI.The finance ministry expects the economy to grow 7% next year.Given the global situation, how do you see the prospects?The belief in the finance ministry is that we have a possible drag coming from the external sector but that we have other sources. We have enough domestic sources of demand. One has to applaud the political and economic judgment of FM in deciding that it was appropriate to pursue the path of fiscal consolidation. There is transparency. What this actually reflects is responsible economic management, which is one reason we are where we are. Second, it also creates a buffer so that there is policy space if we do encounter headwinds.That’s the hope and expectation. We have an independent central bank and an inflation targeting central bank, so it is up to the monetary policy committee to take a call through the monetary policy committee on the repo rate .The PM has said that when India grows its states grow. India is a composite of 37 states and UTs. They are each at very different points in their demographic transition. There are some states where the net replacement rate is down to 1%, like Kerala . There are others, particularly UP and Bihar, which are in their earliest stage of demographic transition and each one of these states is the size of a large European country. There are two implications of that — one is internal labour mobility and it will become an even larger part of our growth model. The govt has taken several steps to create a unified market. Our main endowment is our human capital and that has to be equipped to participate in global exchange in many ways. We know from China, Japan that the demographic dividend partly depends on markets and on human capital. But the golden period is fairly short lived, about 15 years, when the so called dependency ratio declines. The other big opportunity the PM has been highlighting is bringing women much more into the active labour force.When Niti was set up there was the idea of a three-year vision and a seven-year strategy paper. The reality is that schemes of govt tend to be aligned with the award of the Finance Commission . There are various established building blocks or hand holds which are already a matter of govt policy. The PM is much more interested in a national debate on what it means to be a Viksit Bharat or modern society. We have a collective goal and it is for the democratic polity to define what that goal should be. Its emphatically not for a super mandarin bureaucracy. It is not going to be Lee Kwan Yew’s Singapore led from the top.It’s entirely a finance ministry matter but I would be lying if I didn’t say when I visit certain states there is this complaint. A big frontier would be resource mobilisation at the state level. Second is going to be rationalisation of subsidies not only at the Union level, but also at the state level. All chief ministers sit on my governing council. When they convene as the governing council, I see them in their role as development practitioners. The world is beginning to appreciate quite how much institutional and political maturity India attained in our 75 years and the most fundamental dimension of a democracy, we have orderly transfers of power. There are enough buffers to ensure that what happens in state finances is unlikely to create macro instability. Those risks are well contained by our Constitution. The chief ministers know that they are going to be judged by development outcomes and so you can have the sugar rush of changing of pension plans or various handouts but if the cupboard is bare you are not going to be able to deliver.","Suman Bery is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China.

Government's Marathon to 2047: Emphasis on Fiscal Prudence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/governments-marathon-to-2047-emphasis-on-fiscal-prudence/articleshow/107371788.cms,"What was the thinking behind keeping the vote on account absolutely straight?

So is it the idea to keep the Budget completely transparent?

The capex has risen 11.1% and there is an emphasis on infrastructure spending. But there is also the hope that the private sector will now take over and start capital spending. Given the geopolitical situation, how confident is the govt that it will pan out as planned?

Finance secretary T V Somanathan, in an interview with TOI, says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047 . Excerpts:If you see the Budget speech you will see the emphasis on 2047. The govt has set its sight on running that marathon.Running to 2047 is a marathon , it’s not a sprint. If you are going to run a marathon, you need to be in good shape and you can’t have short-term stimulants or something that will get you some yards and then it’s done.The whole focus is on making India a developed country by 2047, for which a healthy present and a strong fiscal position is an important concomitant. Some purely short term measures don’t really fit into that picture. It’s a consistent picture: focus on the long term for which you need to build strength in the short term and that needs to be done by prudence in fiscal policy and by not doing things which can detract you from that path. Not doing the wrong thing is more important than appearing to do things.The idea is that govt finances may be good, bad or indifferent depending on the times, depending on the circumstances, depending on the policies. But what is the position should be reflected as reasonably and accurately as possible. That is an emphasis. As regards the Finance Commission, again the terms of reference that have been given to them are the terms in the Constitution.What is the means by which the devolution should be done is a matter they have full discretion. They can actually take all kinds of factors into account and in a sense we felt this time based on my review of the previous commissions that the right expression would be less is more. The shorter, less prescriptive terms of reference gives full scope for all stakeholders including state govts to express their viewpoints and for the commission to take a balanced view of the different perspectives and then come to its award. Ultimately the award of the Finance Commission is about devolution and grant for which full scope has now been given to them.n There are incipient signs of private capital expenditure accelerating. There are some surveys I have seen done by some of the chambers industry, which show high levels of investment. The PMI, which is a sort of leading indicator, is also looking pretty healthy. Capacity utilisation is one reason that private sector capital expenditure doesn’t immediately pick up when the economy starts accelerating because there is surplus capacity.But increasingly I get the sense that many industries are beginning to reach levels where they have to add capacity. When that happens capital investment will happen. Another pointer also mentioned in the Budget speech you may notice that our airlines have placed large orders for planes — that is capital expenditure.When you import 1,000 aircraft, it’s just not 1,000 aircraft, there are concomitant additions to ground handling facilities, you need airports to expand, you need to employ people to do that. That means a lot of jobs. The aircraft is capital but then look at the effect it is going to have on skilled jobs. So capital expenditure is happening. I am fairly confident that we will have decent capital expenditure in the year to come and that will become a new source of acceleration.",Finance secretary T V Somanathan says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047.

Income Tax Changes Budget 2024 : In the recent Budget 2024 speech, the Finance Minister kept the Section 80C tax deduction limit unchanged. The maximum limit for claiming tax benefits under Section 80C remains at Rs 1.5 lakh for the current fiscal year 2023-24 and will stay the same for individuals looking to save on taxes through Section 80C investments in the upcoming fiscal year 2024-25.Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions. Individuals can reduce their gross taxable income by up to Rs 1.5 lakh per financial year by engaging in these specific investments or expenditures.You can save on taxes through Section 80C by investing in things like Employees' Provident Fund (EPF), Public Provident Fund (PPF), Equity Linked Saving Scheme (ELSS) mutual funds, National Savings Certificate (NSC), and 5-year tax-saving fixed deposits with banks or post offices. Additionally, paying life insurance policy premiums also qualifies for tax benefits under Section 80C.It is important to note that each eligible investment comes with its specific maximum limit, rate of return, liquidity, and taxation rules for the earned returns, states ET in a report. For instance, the most you can invest in PPF in a financial year is Rs 1.5 lakh. Meanwhile, there's no limit on the amount you can invest in ELSS mutual funds, but the Section 80C deduction is capped at Rs 1.5 lakh.If individuals can't make specific investments, they can still get deductions under Section 80C from their gross taxable income through certain expenses. These expenses include repaying the principal amount of a home loan, tuition fees for children, payment of stamp duty, registration fees, and other costs related to buying a house.Since the financial year 2020-21, individuals without any business income must annually choose between the old and new tax regimes. As of the fiscal year 2023-24, the new tax regime is the default option. Consequently, individuals seeking tax deductions under Section 80C must opt for the old tax regime since this deduction isn't available in the new tax regime. It's crucial for taxpayers to be aware of these rules to make informed decisions about their tax planning and investment strategies.","Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget which is an interim budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year. The budget talks about inclusive development both, social and geographical, especially for youth, women, farmers, and the poor. Continued focus on improving logistics through infrastructure spend on roads, rail, airports, ports increases productivity for companies and citizens alike.To make ‘Viksit Bharat’ by 2047, the government’s focus is on improving and empowering people’s capabilities through various skilling initiatives. It is encouraging to see that Skill India Mission has succeeded in training more than 1.4 crore youth and upskilling and reskilling 54 lakh youth. I am particularly happy to see the continued focus on youth and women entrepreneurship and the announcement of a new fund which will give interest free 50 year loans for startups will provide a domestic fillip to startups supplementing venture capital we have traditionally relied on from abroad.PM Mudra Yojana has sanctioned 43 crore loans aggregating to 22.5 lakh crore to youth entrepreneurs and thirty crore Mudra Yojana loans to women entrepreneurs. There are several other schemes like Fund of Funds, Start-Up India, and Start-Up Credit Guarantee schemes that are assisting our youth. Further, the extension of tax benefits to Start-ups and investments made by sovereign wealth funds/pension funds, till 31st March 2025 depicts the government’s effort to support the startup eco- system.This aligns quite well with India Sanitation Coalition’s efforts to give impetus to the start-up world. Over the past 7 editions of our ISC-FICCI Sanitation Awards, we have recognized and promoted several start-ups in the sanitation space, many of whom are successful businesses now!While the finance minister did not provide detailed information on Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH), the budget allocation sees a slight increase in spend demonstrating continued focus on this highly successful program. The acknowledgement that the private sector has increasingly played a substantial role in addressing WASH issues in both urban and rural areas, with numerous projects underway through Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs), highlights the government's commitment to addressing challenges in this sector.A perfect example is the LightHouse Initiative initiated by the Department of Drinking Water along with the India Sanitation Coalition (ISC) by partnering with major corporates across India to develop model villages in Solid and Liquid Waste Management (SLWM) under SBM-Grameen. From this budget, there is an expectation that the government will persist in prioritizing Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) as the path toward achieving the country's Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6). Additionally, it is hoped that the government will uphold its commitment to making necessary infrastructural investments for SLWM.The budget speech rightly celebrates the fact that we have 83 lakh SHGs and 9 crore women beneficiaries. The microfinance movement in the country and the possibility of empowering women members of SHGs through livelihood skilling is a key to bringing women into mainstream economic advancement.The focus on green growth, rooftop solar, wind, biomass, e-vehicles all help with our green energy thrust. The tourism sector was mentioned and could be a huge job provider for youth and women.Guided by the principle ‘Reform, Perform, and Transform’, the budget emphasizes efficient implementation of various policies by improving coordination with states and relevant stakeholders. This is critical both for infra spend and social programsIt is noteworthy that ISC’s Climate Resilient Coastal Cities project which is being implemented in PPP (Public-Private Partnership) mode in four coastal states of Karnataka, Gujarat, Goa and Maharashtra is congruent with the government’s priority of promoting climate-resilient activities for the blue economy 2.0, a scheme for restoration and adaptation measures, and coastal aquaculture.The budget also focuses on the Aspirational districts program where assistance will be given to the states for faster development of aspirational districts and blocks, including the generation of ample economic opportunities. This is again very crucial as it has a huge potential to transform the landscape of our country while making sure no -one is left behind.Overall, this budget has embraced economic strategies and develops the building blocks that nurture and uphold growth, promote inclusive and sustainable development, and enhance productivity.","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year.

How India's digital public infrastructure can push inclusive global growth,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/how-indias-digital-public-infrastructure-can-push-inclusive-global-growth/articleshow/109545965.cms,"(The writer is Ambassador of India to United Nations)

Over the past decade, India has embraced a digital-first approach, effectively integrating technology into the fabric of its society to ensure economic inclusion for all citizens. This has been embodied in the Citizen Stack framework , a robust digital infrastructure enabling presence-less identities, cash-less transactions, seamless service delivery , and scalable techno-legal regulations.This infrastructure is integral to India's commitment to inclusive growth and mirrors the principle of 'Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam' (the world is one family), emphasised at the G20.India's dedication to the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is evident in its strategic use of digital tools to promote digital equity and progress towards SDGs focused on poverty, gender equality, economic growth, and reduced inequalities. The investment in Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) has expanded access to essential services, particularly for underserved communities, enhancing livelihoods and aligning with global commitments.DPI, a collaboration between private entities, technology innovators, and policymakers, includes initiatives like the Aadhaar system, which provides a unique digital identity to over 1.4 billion citizens. The JAM Trinity (Jan Dhan-Aadhaar-Mobile) strategy has significantly accelerated financial inclusion, with India emerging as a role model in digital finance. This strategy has enabled large volumes of digital payments, improved financial access through micro-lending and pensions, and reduced leakages in govt transfers, thus saving substantial amounts and increasing the Tax Revenue to GDP ratio from 8.2% to 17.1%.The private sector's role has been crucial, particularly in the fintech industry, which has contributed to India becoming the third-largest startup ecosystem globally with 113 unicorns. The digital economy, which grew from 8.5% of GVA in 2019 to 12.5% in 2023, is expected to contribute between 2.9% and 4.2% of the GDP by 2030. This growth has been supported by increased smartphone use, enhanced internet connectivity, and govt initiatives pushing for a digital economy.In recent years, India has focused on expanding its data economy, ensuring secure data flows and robust digital infrastructure. Citizens now enjoy broader access to e-commerce, capital markets, and financial services, moving towards a 'digital-first open network society.' The DPI has also demonstrated its agility during the Covid-19 pandemic, with platforms like CoWIN facilitating rapid vaccination of 90% of India's adult population by streamlining processes from scheduling to certificate issuance.Looking forward, India aims to continue leveraging its DPI not only for current technological needs but also as a foundation for future innovations in areas like artificial intelligence (AI), data protection and decentralised infrastructures. The Data Empowerment and Protection Framework (DEPA) will guide the ethical use of AI and data, ensuring security and privacy, while fostering an inclusive digital ecosystem.Against this backdrop, we have invited all member states to join us at Citizen Stack, the inaugural conference on Digital Public Infrastructures, at United Nations headquarters in New York on April 25-26. This will be an opportunity to share our experiences and insights on DPI implementation. Citizen Stack (inspired by India Stack) is designed to an 'open-source playbook' for all nations to hear about our journey, our wins, perhaps some misses, so that nations can write their own digital priorities more effectively.As we share our journey and experiences with the global community, we recognise that there is no one-size-fits-all solution. Instead, we offer our learnings and models as dynamic resources that countries can build upon and adapt to innovate according to their own national priorities and contexts. The ultimate goal is the upliftment of people everywhere, ensuring that the SDGs are achieved through a spirit of cooperation and mutual respect.","India has embraced a digital-first approach, effectively integrating technology into the fabric of its society to ensure economic inclusion for all citizens.

The European Union ( EU ) last week adopted a “more favourable” visa regime for Indians “with an established travel history , if (their) passport validity allows.” They will now get up to five-year validity Schengen visas.Though less than America’s 10-year visitor visas and United Kingdom’s option of getting a visa valid for up to the same period by paying over 1lakh as fees, EU officials told TOI five years is also “a big step”.“According to the newly adopted visa ‘cascade’ regime for India, Indian nationals can now be issued long-term, multi-entry Schengen visas valid for two years after having obtained and lawfully used two visas within the previous three years. The two-year visa will normally be followed by a five-year visa, if the passport has sufficient validity remaining. During the validity period of these visas, holders enjoy travel rights equivalent to visa-free nationals,” the EU said in a statement.The decision was taken on April 18, because of “strengthened relations under the EU-India common agenda on migration and mobility, which seeks comprehensive cooperation on migration policy between the EU and India, with facilitation of people-to-people contacts being of key aspect due to the importance of India as a partner for the EU.”Before this change, Schengen countries mostly granted short term visas even to frequent travellers to Europe.

He had tried to break open three houses in the area in vain before jamming open the kitchen window of the director’s house. The locker in which the gold was kept was not locked,” police said.Interestingly, the accused’s wife is a Sitamarhi district panchayat council member and he used it to his advantage. The car which he was using had the board of the district panchayat which helped him evade police inspections to an extent, police said.City police commissioner Shyamsundar said it was a proud moment for Kochi police to have arrested the accused within 15 hours after the crime. As much as 1.20-cr worth of gold ornaments and valuables was stolen from the house.Irfan is also accused in a case registered by Museum police in 2021 when ornaments worth Rs 2.5 lakh and Rs 60,000 in cash were stolen from the house of a prominent jewelry chain owner.Museum police said attempts were made to get him in custody when Goa police had arrested him, but this didn’t pan out due to the pandemic. We would soon record his arrest and take him into custody after getting permission from the court in Kochi, said a Museum police officer.The team of Kochi police which made the arrest under DCP K S Sudarshan and ACP P Rajkumar included Inspectors Premananda Krishnan and Richard Varghese.

US Congress passes divest-or-ban bill on TikTok: What happens now,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-congress-passes-divest-or-ban-bill-on-tiktok-what-happens-now/articleshow/109547042.cms,"What is the main objective of the recent US legislation regarding TikTok?

How will TikTok respond to the legislation?

What changes will TikTok users in the US notice in the interim?

What are the potential consequences if ByteDance does not comply with the divestiture order?

How does the Chinese government view this legislation?

On Tuesday, the US Senate passed a bill mandating that the highly popular social media platform TikTok be sold off from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance , or face exclusion from the US market. This legislation forms a part of a substantial $95 billion foreign aid package that includes military support for Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan, and has successfully passed through Congress to await President Joe Biden 's signature.Concerns have been raised by US and other Western officials regarding TikTok's immense popularity among the youth, suggesting that it enables the Chinese government to gather data and conduct surveillance on its users, who number 170 million in the United States alone. Critics contend that TikTok acts in subordination to Beijing and serves as a medium for disseminating propaganda. However, these allegations are vehemently refuted by both China and the company.This legislative action, which might lead to the unprecedented exclusion of a company from the US market, received approval in the Senate with a vote of 79-18, following strong bipartisan support in the House of Representatives three days earlier. President Biden has expressed his intention to sign the bill into law.The primary goal of the legislation is to compel ByteDance to divest its TikTok operations in the US within a specified timeframe—about nine months, with a potential three-month extension if necessary. This drastic step is intended to mitigate concerns that the Chinese government could access US user data or manipulate content to conduct espionage and spread propaganda.TikTok is expected to challenge the constitutionality of the legislation through the legal system. Immediately after the bill becomes law, TikTok may seek a preliminary injunction to halt its enforcement, thereby allowing the company to continue operations while the court considers the case. This legal approach is consistent with TikTok's previous strategies in confronting restrictive measures from US authorities.Until the legal and corporate battles are resolved, TikTok users in the US are unlikely to experience any immediate changes to their app usage. The platform will continue to operate as usual, providing content tailored to individual preferences through its sophisticated algorithm, unless a court ruling or the completion of the divestiture alters the status quo.If ByteDance fails to sell TikTok within the allotted timeframe and no legal injunctions are in place, the app could be removed from major US app stores, effectively cutting off new downloads and potentially limiting functionality for existing installations. This would not only impact users but also millions of businesses that utilize the platform for marketing and community engagement.The Chinese government has opposed the forced sale of TikTok and is likely to view this legislation as another strain on US-China relations. China's regulation of technology exports, including algorithms like those used by TikTok, could complicate any potential sale, adding another layer of complexity to the negotiations and international diplomatic interactions.(With inputs from agencies)","On Tuesday, the US Senate passed a bill mandating that the highly popular social media platform TikTok be sold off from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance.
