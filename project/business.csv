India's capital expenditure outlay for FY25 could see an increase of 8-10% from the Rs 11.11 lakh crore allocated in the interim budget. This is due to better-than-expected tax revenue and a record surplus transfer from the RBI .""Both tax and non-tax revenue are expected to be better,"" a senior official told ET. ""Additional surplus transfer from RBI provides enough headroom to spend more.""The interim budget for the current election year was presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in February, with the full budget expected to be announced approximately a month after the formation of the new government, following the declaration of election results on June 4.The Reserve Bank of India's recent announcement of a Rs 2.1 lakh crore surplus transfer to the Centre could be partially utilized by the government to strengthen capital expenditure in the current year, maintaining its focus on public investment-led growth to support the gradual increase in private investment.Also Read | FM Nirmala Sitharaman: Modi government reshaped Union Budget in 10 years; reforms to continue for Viksit Bharat India's capital expenditure saw significant increases of 42% in FY22 and 24% in FY23.

India big gainer from China plus one strategy! 'Exports to almost double to $835 billion'; here’s why,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/india-big-gainer-from-china-plus-one-strategy-exports-to-almost-double-to-835-billion-heres-why/articleshow/110523123.cms,"Trade Prowess

India and Vietnam are benefiting the most from the China plus one strategy, which is anticipated to create new growth opportunities for Asian economies, as per a report by Nomura released on Tuesday. The report predicts that India's exports will surge to $835 billion by 2030 from $431 billion in 2023, driven by its large domestic market that attracts firms seeking supply chain alternatives to China.ET quoted Nomura as saying, ""Firms in electronics, apparel & toys, automobile & components, capital goods and semiconductor manufacturing are looking to invest in India. Given India's large domestic consumer market, firms setting up shop in India are attracted also because of the captive domestic market.""The report forecasts a 10% annual growth in exports over the period, with electronics becoming the fastest-growing sector, achieving a compound annual growth rate of 24% and nearly tripling in value to $83 billion by 2030. Machinery exports are expected to more than double to $61 billion by 2030 from $28 billion in 2023.Nomura believes that ""the low production linked incentive (PLI) disbursements are not a good reflection of India's potential on global value chain integration. Its large market size, faster growth, lower labour cost and political and economic stability make it an attractive investment destination for consumer goods production to both cater to domestic demand and also for exports.""The report anticipates India's share of global trade to increase to 2.8% by 2030.The competitiveness of Indian production is expected to accelerate exports and improve the country's trade balance and current account, according to Nomura.

Japan and Korea are also investing in India's auto, consumer durable and electronics sectors to take advantage of the growing domestic demand and to use it as a manufacturing base,"" the report said.Nomura added that the strengthening of India's manufacturing sector and its increasing share in exports will help the corporate sector sustain 12-17% earnings growth over the medium term.","Nomura predicts that India's exports will surge to $835 billion by 2030 from $431 billion in 2023.

Will the next Satya Nadella sit out of India?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/will-the-next-satya-nadella-sit-out-of-india/articleshow/110516271.cms,"In the past decade, as startups have boomed, it has been common to hear experts say: ""It's a matter of time before India produces a Google or Facebook."" That hasn't happened yet, though we too believe it will, sooner than later.Today, as global capability centres (GCCs, the offshore tech & business entities of MNCs ) in India surge, we are beginning to hear similar excited words. ""Maybe the next Satya Nadella is going to be sitting somewhere in Bengaluru,"" says Lalit Ahuja, founder & CEO of ANSR, a consultancy that has helped over 100 GCCs establish bases in India.TOI, and Times Techies in particular, have been tracking the meteoric rise of GCCs for years now. In 2018, we carried a two-pager in TOI on how core operations of MNCs are being moved into their GCCs in India, why India's vast tech talent has become so globally coveted, and how the faces of cities like Bengaluru are being changed by the entry of GCCs. Late last year, we wrote, based on consultancy Zinnov's estimates, that more than 5,000 global leaders of MNCs are sitting out of India GCCs. These are not just tech leaders, but also operations' leaders, including, significantly, the chief customer officer of US data protection and management company Commvault (by that yardstick, the possibility of a Nadella sitting out of India isn't far-fetched). Zinnov estimates this number will rise to 30,000 by 2030. In February, we wrote, based on consultancy Wizmatic's estimates, that the GCC revenue figure of $46 billion that Nasscom put out for 2022-23 could be a gross underestimate, that it could actually be more than $100 billion. That's more than 3% of India's GDP.Today, the India GCC phenomenon has caught international imagination. The Economist magazine has just written articles on it, pointing out also that American firms have 1.5 million staff in India, more than in any other foreign country. They note the substantial contribution of GCCs to India's GDP, and more particularly the country's services exports. They point out that GCCs could do to India what FDI into China's manufacturing did for that country. And the value brought in could be even more significant, considering what's moving into India is the knowledge base of the world.Ankur Mittal, SVP of technology & MD for India at Lowe's, the $86-billion US retailer specialising in home improvement and which has a 5,000-strong GCC in India, says US companies have realised that talent availability in India is ""far superior to most other locations."" There are, he says, pockets of talent in the US, in countries in Europe, but nowhere is the abundance of talent like in India.Ahuja says it's easy to build a large-scale team in India that can be trusted to drive business outcomes with certainty and predictability. ""A company like Best Buy that is just coming into India can hire from Walmart, Target, Lowe's, Amazon, and even Microsoft and Google. They can hire teams within weeks that can build enterprise-grade capabilities and help in digital transformation. A Cigna comes to India and can do 10,000 people in three years,"" he says.He says given that MNCs today are attempting major transformations, it's also far easier for them to do it out of a new remote location. In home locations, he says, there could be employee resistance to change. Young employees in India, he says, also work a lot harder, and are a lot more committed than employees in home locations.Another huge India advantage is the possibility of housing diverse talent under one roof, which almost every MNC today is consciously putting in place. Mittal notes the presence of technology, design, product management, data science, AI and even business talent like marketing and merchandising in Lowe's Bengaluru facility. ""When business is closer to engineers, bringing out a product becomes a lot faster,"" he says.Over 120 global functions across business and engineering are carried out from Goldman Sachs's India GCCs that have 8,500 employees. Over the last two decades, functions performed from India have evolved from end-of-day support for trading platforms and exchange connectivity, to algo trading platform support, data analytics, and client reporting. ""Today, our India GCC is a CoE (centre of excellence) with thought leadership for several equities engineering functions,"" says Gunjan Samtani, global COO of engineering at Goldman Sachs.A major project that the India centre led is Atlas, a low-latency trading platform that hosts a suite of trading strategies to help clients achieve their trading objectives, perform historical analyses, build quantitative models with real-time market information and trade execution. This platform helped trim microseconds in execution of trades for Goldman Sachs' clients. ""This latency reduction helped us engage existing and newer hedge funds and quant clients,"" Samtani says.JPMorgan Chase, the world's largest bank, has some 55,000 people in its India GCCs. Deepak Mangla, CEO of corporate centres for India & Philippines at the bank, says the India GCC is a microcosm of practically all lines of businesses and functions, not just technology. ""We manage operations for the bank, we engage extensively in risk management, we perform significant work for finance and HR controls,"" he says.Among several path-breaking work done at Lowe's India is what's called LORMN (Lowe's One Roof Media Network). It was conceptualised in India and is among the fastest growing retail ad networks in the US. It allows vendors to put ads on Lowe's website and other sites. ""It's very challenging work because everything has to be automated, all the bidding has to happen in milliseconds, and then we have to provide vendors with analytics around it. It's a very high margin business, so it is driving margin and contributing to the topline,"" says Mittal.And that's precisely why more and more global leaders of MNCs are sitting out of India.","TOI, and Times Techies in particular, have been tracking the meteoric rise of GCCs for years now. In 2018, we carried a two-pager in TOI on how core operations of MNCs are being moved into their GCCs in India.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110516419,imgsize-997768,width-400,resizemode-4/110516419.jpg"
"IL&FS, arms told to recover Rs 150 crore from ex-directors",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/ilfs-arms-told-to-recover-rs-150-crore-from-ex-directors/articleshow/110544007.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a rare move, govt has asked the board of IL&FS and two of its arms to recover excess money of Rs 150 crore, including managerial remuneration and commissions, from ex-directors after the entities restated their accounts to show losses of Rs 9,600 crore for financial years 2013 to 2018, instead of a profit of Rs 1,869 crore estimated by the management and board, which had to be superseded following massive irregularities.Directors of IL&FS Financial Services (I-FIN) and IL&FS Transport Network, where accounts were not found to be in order, are facing similar action, official sources told TOI.A large part of the amount is to be recovered from four key directors - Ravi Parthasarthy, Arun Saha, Hari Sankaran and Ramesh Bawa - with the sum adding up to over Rs 100 crore. Milind Patel, Rajesh Kotian, and Vibhav Kapoor are some of the other directors, who face similar action.The independent directors, some of whom are big names in the corporate sector, have to refund a part of the commission paid during their tenure when the fraud was perpetuated. The list includes prominent names, such as, Maruti Suzuki chairman R C Bhargava, VBHC founder and director Jerry Rao, former HDFC boss K M Mistry, former LIC chairman S B Mathur, retired civil servant Michael Pinto and Rina Kamath.After TOI first reported about the revised accounts on May 6, a former independent director had said that board members like them should not be held responsible as they were not responsible for day-to-day functioning of the entities and went along with the accounts that were presented and discussed at the board meetings.The boards of IL&FS, I-FIN and ITNL had recast the financial statements for five financial years as mandated by NCLAT and submitted their findings to the ministry of corporate affairs (MCA). The company has also filed these accounts with NCLT so that they can be taken on record.When contacted, an IL&FS spokesperson said: ""All three companies, IL&FS, IFIN and ITNL, have written letters to their erstwhile directors informing them of the excess managerial remuneration paid to them between FY2013-18. They have been asked to refund the excess managerial remuneration to the company under applicable laws. These amounts have been computed based on the recasted statements for FY2013-18.""An official source said the action has been initiated under sections 197 and 198 of the Companies Act. Companies Act, 1956, which was replaced by a new law, had stricter provisions related to directors of companies whose boards were superseded as it made them ineligible for board seats in future.","In a rare move, govt has asked the board of IL&FS and two of its arms to recover excess money of Rs 150 crore, including managerial remuneration and commissions.

Sunil Bharti Mittal recalls how an ‘inspiring’ meeting with PM Modi was a turning point for Airtel,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sunil-bharti-mittal-recalls-how-an-inspiring-meeting-with-pm-modi-was-a-turning-point-for-airtel/articleshow/110548707.cms,"In September 2018, a meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi marked a pivotal moment for Sunil Bharti Mittal-led Bharti Airtel , which was grappling with a severe crisis at the time, according to the Bharti Group founder.Airtel was struggling due to the impact of free voice and data services provided by new entrant Reliance Jio and a series of decisions by the telecom regulator that negatively affected the incumbent market leader, Mittal told ET.Mittal, who had recently concluded his chairmanship of the International Chambers of Commerce and used to occasionally brief the PM on WTO, G20, and other matters, sought permission to discuss the Indian telecom industry's dire situation. During the meeting, conducted in Hindi, Mittal conveyed to the PM: ""I will fight in the marketplace, but I can't fight the government.""In response, Modi assured Mittal that the government would not favor either side and would act in the best interest of the country. He encouraged Mittal to compete in the marketplace, emphasizing that the government would remain impartial.

Whatever is good for the country will be done. You fight in the marketplace. I don't have a view on that. But from the side of the government, you can be sure that the government will not take sides,"" Mittal said. ""And that was enough for me. I got up and thanked him... This was the turning point (for Airtel),” Mittal was quoted as saying.During the interview with the financial daily after Airtel surpassed the $100 billion market cap milestone on May 27, Mittal shared his recollection of a meeting with Modi.

Here was a man telling me-who has himself fought against a lot of odds-that you do your work and be very reassured that this government is going to only do things that are good for the nation,"" he said.This encounter led Mittal to view the regulations, which he had previously considered unfavorable to Airtel , from a broader perspective. He realized that lower tariffs might have been advantageous for the government politically and could have helped democratize data services. The reassurance that there was no hidden agenda allowed him to see things differently.Airtel's market cap has grown by more than $80 billion in the past five years, from around $19 billion in 2019, which was less than the total investment in the business up to that point.Also Read | Relief for mobile users!

NEW DELHI: Global ratings agency S&P on Wednesday revised India's outlook to 'positive' from 'stable' citing robust growth and improvement in the quality of govt spending, but kept the sovereign rating at the lowest investment grade of BBB (minus).""We expect sound economic fundamentals to underpin the growth momentum over the next two to three years. Regardless of the election outcome we expect broad continuity in economic reforms and fiscal policies,"" said S&P while explaining the rationale for the revision.Global ratings agency S&P said, “Our positive outlook on India is predicated on its robust economic growth, pronounced improvement in the quality of govt spending, and political commitment to fiscal consolidation.

The finance minister set the stage for a ""Viksit Bharat by 2047"", on the core principles of ‘Sabka Saath’, ‘Sabka Vikas’, ‘Sabka Vishwas’, with ‘Sabka Prayas’ being added as a new theme in the interim Budget.This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data i.e., farmer welfare and N for Nari utthan i.e., support for women entrepreneurs.These form the pillars of a comprehensive inclusive development. The Government's commitment to sustainable development under the strategy for Amrit Kaal includes achieving 'Net Zero' by 2070, rooftop solarization for one crore households and robust health initiatives.The Indian economy's resilience takes center stage amidst positive indicators of declining current account deficit as a percentage of GDP, falling unemployment rates, and a notable rise in digital transactions. These statistics affirm the robustness of the economy, showcasing a trajectory of growth and stability.The achievements in taxation reforms are nothing short of remarkable, with direct tax collections more than trebling in the last decade, the number of tax return filers increasing by 2.4 times, average processing time of tax returns plummeting from 93 days in FY 2013-14 to an impressive 10 days in FY 2023-24, resulting in issuance of quick refunds. These are the results of consistent progressive measures thus obviating the need for, and rightly avoiding, any last-minute populist measures.No change in existing tax rates, both for direct and indirect taxes, is a good indicator of stability and predictability for investors and taxpayers.A welcome move to waive outstanding tax demands that are minor, disputed, and unreconciled. This involves the withdrawal of outstanding direct tax demands up to Rs. 25,000 pertaining to the period up to FY 2009-10 and up to Rs.10,000 for FY 2010-11 to 2014-15.The Government's commitment to fostering a business-friendly environment is evident in its intent to extend specific tax benefits for start-ups, investments by sovereign wealth funds/ pension funds, and certain IFSC units. The extension has been made now until March 31, 2025. This might help in creating a conducive landscape for business.To align with the CBDT notification issued earlier, the provisions relating to tax collection at source concerning remittances under the Liberalized Remittance Scheme have now been formally incorporated in the Finance Bill, 2024, setting the rate at 20% for amounts exceeding Rs. 7 lakhs in a financial year.The Finance Bill, 2024 proposes an extension of the time limit for introducing the faceless scheme by the Central Government for transfer pricing proceedings, DRP Proceedings, and ITAT Proceedings, up to March 31, 2025.The interim Budget 2024 may not have proposed significant tax announcements, but it very well positioned the prelude to the full budget post the upcoming elections. Considering the potential impact on the population across the four pillars of GYAN, a sizable portion of India stands to be covered. The interim Budget’s focus on the tax front resembles a report card, highlighting the maturity achieved by our tax system. The enhancement of taxpayer services was emphasized as a key priority.","This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data and N for Nari utthan.

Interim Budget for a Viksit Bharat: It’s for everyone and all,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/interim-budget-for-a-viksit-bharat-its-for-everyone-and-all/articleshow/107497439.cms,"By Akhilesh Tuteja

The Finance Minister on February 01, 2024, delivered a truly innovative interim budget. At first glance, it did not seem like an interim budget but looked more like the budget to drive further growth and a continuum of inclusive growth-oriented investments.At the outset, this budget brings a wonderful balance between fiscal prudence and continued investment for growth.It's not easy to continue the glide path of reducing the fiscal deficit and continuing to make significant investments in all areas including infrastructure, R&D, energy transition, technology, skilling, and social welfare. The surprising reduction in fiscal deficit of 5.8% as against the budgeted 5.9% for FY24 and the projection of 5.1% in FY25 with a clear focus on increasing investments was a huge positive.This was a budget for everyone and all because it caters to every part of the Indian economy and society. The FM has carefully catered to the investment needs of various sectors. The continued focus on youth, impoverished, women and farmers to increase their involvement and contribution to economic growth is evident. By committing an 11.1% increase in capital expenditure to 11,11,111 lakh crore, the FM has clearly brought every single 1 in this growth journey.What was very impressive was the inclusion strategy of the government. The focus on women's empowerment for the past few years is unprecedented, which is reflected in the inclusion of women in the workforce moving from 23.3% to 37% in the last five years. The thirty crore Mudra Yojna loans to women entrepreneurs were a great boost to the Nari Shakti initiative. We already have over 10 million Lakhpati Didis and what is truly evident is like a corporate CFO, the FM has revised the earlier target of 20 million Lakhpati Didis to 30 million. The government also plans to invest in initiatives to encourage young girls between the ages of 9 and 14 to undertake the vaccination for cervical cancer which is again a great boost to Nari Shakti.A lot needs to be done to bring more women into all parts of economic growth but the journey so far and the vision of the future is truly inspiring.While India continues on its technological prowess and makes its mark in new technologies like Artificial Intelligence, we need a multi-pronged strategy to harness the power of AI. We need a clear focus on building AI systems in India so that we not only emerge as a global leader in this new era but can build models, which are specific to India that will benefit Indians. At the same time, we need a very wide coverage program to build skills to leverage AI to its fullest potential. The biggest contribution we can make to the inclusion of youth in the economic development of the country is by skilling them in new skill areas. In the last few years, the Skill India Mission has trained 14 million youth, reskilled over 5 million youth and established a staggering 3,000 new ITIs. The future of any country will depend as much on capital investments as on skill investments.The focus on agricultural development and support to the farmer continues through direct financial assistance to farmers. The farmers have benefited by getting crop insurance through PM Fasal Bima Yojana. It's not just the farmers, the PM-SVANidhi provides credit assistance to a large number of street vendors.The last few years have seen the journey of affordable housing through Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY). There is a slight increase in allocation to launch a scheme for encouraging the middle class to build or buy new homes. This investment will likely propel a wider economic development and increase employment.India has seen a tremendous rise in entrepreneurship in the last few years. In order to continue the journey and promote new startups, the government proposes to extend certain tax benefits, which are expiring from March 2024 to March 2025. The MSMEs have not been left behind. With a proposal to provide timely finances to such enterprises, the government has paved the way for their growth, so they can look to compete globally.All in all, it’s a truly inclusive budget with a clear focus on development not just by giving away freebies but enabling the people to participate in the economic development activity. While the FM calls the comprehensive GDP - Governance, Development & Performance – to me, this budget is inclusive of another GDP – gender, demography, and professions.","Akhilesh Tuteja is Partner and Head, Clients and Markets, KPMG in India.

‘Enough domestic sources of demand to counter drag from external sector’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/enough-domestic-sources-of-demand-to-counter-drag-from-external-sector/articleshow/107372012.cms,"Do you think the

creates room for lower interest rates?

One of the issues that the Budget has flagged is the demographic challenge and opportunity and the societal change that is taking place. How do you view this?

Niti Aayog is working on the Viksit Bharat roadmap. What will be the focus areas?

You are as much a representative of the Centre as well as the states. Is it time to revisit the entire formula for transfers to states particularly on the issue of cesses and surcharges?

Suman Bery , who heads Niti Aayog , the govt think tank, is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China, which he says is also an opportunity for India. The economist is confident that Indian states remain resilient. Excerpts of the interview with TOI.The finance ministry expects the economy to grow 7% next year. Given the global situation, how do you see the prospects?The belief in the finance ministry is that we have a possible drag coming from the external sector but that we have other sources. We have enough domestic sources of demand. One has to applaud the political and economic judgment of FM in deciding that it was appropriate to pursue the path of fiscal consolidation. There is transparency. What this actually reflects is responsible economic management, which is one reason we are where we are. Second, it also creates a buffer so that there is policy space if we do encounter headwinds.That’s the hope and expectation. We have an independent central bank and an inflation targeting central bank, so it is up to the monetary policy committee to take a call through the monetary policy committee on the repo rate .The PM has said that when India grows its states grow. India is a composite of 37 states and UTs. They are each at very different points in their demographic transition. There are some states where the net replacement rate is down to 1%, like Kerala . There are others, particularly UP and Bihar, which are in their earliest stage of demographic transition and each one of these states is the size of a large European country. There are two implications of that — one is internal labour mobility and it will become an even larger part of our growth model. The govt has taken several steps to create a unified market. Our main endowment is our human capital and that has to be equipped to participate in global exchange in many ways. We know from China, Japan that the demographic dividend partly depends on markets and on human capital. But the golden period is fairly short lived, about 15 years, when the so called dependency ratio declines. The other big opportunity the PM has been highlighting is bringing women much more into the active labour force.When Niti was set up there was the idea of a three-year vision and a seven-year strategy paper. The reality is that schemes of govt tend to be aligned with the award of the Finance Commission . There are various established building blocks or hand holds which are already a matter of govt policy. The PM is much more interested in a national debate on what it means to be a Viksit Bharat or modern society. We have a collective goal and it is for the democratic polity to define what that goal should be. Its emphatically not for a super mandarin bureaucracy. It is not going to be Lee Kwan Yew’s Singapore led from the top.It’s entirely a finance ministry matter but I would be lying if I didn’t say when I visit certain states there is this complaint. A big frontier would be resource mobilisation at the state level. Second is going to be rationalisation of subsidies not only at the Union level, but also at the state level. All chief ministers sit on my governing council. When they convene as the governing council, I see them in their role as development practitioners. The world is beginning to appreciate quite how much institutional and political maturity India attained in our 75 years and the most fundamental dimension of a democracy, we have orderly transfers of power. There are enough buffers to ensure that what happens in state finances is unlikely to create macro instability. Those risks are well contained by our Constitution. The chief ministers know that they are going to be judged by development outcomes and so you can have the sugar rush of changing of pension plans or various handouts but if the cupboard is bare you are not going to be able to deliver.","Suman Bery is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China.

Government's Marathon to 2047: Emphasis on Fiscal Prudence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/governments-marathon-to-2047-emphasis-on-fiscal-prudence/articleshow/107371788.cms,"What was the thinking behind keeping the vote on account absolutely straight?

So is it the idea to keep the Budget completely transparent?

The capex has risen 11.1% and there is an emphasis on infrastructure spending. But there is also the hope that the private sector will now take over and start capital spending. Given the geopolitical situation, how confident is the govt that it will pan out as planned?

Finance secretary T V Somanathan, in an interview with TOI, says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047 . Excerpts:If you see the Budget speech you will see the emphasis on 2047. The govt has set its sight on running that marathon.Running to 2047 is a marathon , it’s not a sprint. If you are going to run a marathon, you need to be in good shape and you can’t have short-term stimulants or something that will get you some yards and then it’s done.The whole focus is on making India a developed country by 2047, for which a healthy present and a strong fiscal position is an important concomitant. Some purely short term measures don’t really fit into that picture. It’s a consistent picture: focus on the long term for which you need to build strength in the short term and that needs to be done by prudence in fiscal policy and by not doing things which can detract you from that path. Not doing the wrong thing is more important than appearing to do things.The idea is that govt finances may be good, bad or indifferent depending on the times, depending on the circumstances, depending on the policies. But what is the position should be reflected as reasonably and accurately as possible. That is an emphasis. As regards the Finance Commission, again the terms of reference that have been given to them are the terms in the Constitution.What is the means by which the devolution should be done is a matter they have full discretion. They can actually take all kinds of factors into account and in a sense we felt this time based on my review of the previous commissions that the right expression would be less is more. The shorter, less prescriptive terms of reference gives full scope for all stakeholders including state govts to express their viewpoints and for the commission to take a balanced view of the different perspectives and then come to its award. Ultimately the award of the Finance Commission is about devolution and grant for which full scope has now been given to them.n There are incipient signs of private capital expenditure accelerating. There are some surveys I have seen done by some of the chambers industry, which show high levels of investment. The PMI, which is a sort of leading indicator, is also looking pretty healthy. Capacity utilisation is one reason that private sector capital expenditure doesn’t immediately pick up when the economy starts accelerating because there is surplus capacity.But increasingly I get the sense that many industries are beginning to reach levels where they have to add capacity. When that happens capital investment will happen. Another pointer also mentioned in the Budget speech you may notice that our airlines have placed large orders for planes — that is capital expenditure.When you import 1,000 aircraft, it’s just not 1,000 aircraft, there are concomitant additions to ground handling facilities, you need airports to expand, you need to employ people to do that. That means a lot of jobs. The aircraft is capital but then look at the effect it is going to have on skilled jobs. So capital expenditure is happening. I am fairly confident that we will have decent capital expenditure in the year to come and that will become a new source of acceleration.",Finance secretary T V Somanathan says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047.

Income Tax Changes Budget 2024 : In the recent Budget 2024 speech, the Finance Minister kept the Section 80C tax deduction limit unchanged. The maximum limit for claiming tax benefits under Section 80C remains at Rs 1.5 lakh for the current fiscal year 2023-24 and will stay the same for individuals looking to save on taxes through Section 80C investments in the upcoming fiscal year 2024-25.Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions. Individuals can reduce their gross taxable income by up to Rs 1.5 lakh per financial year by engaging in these specific investments or expenditures.You can save on taxes through Section 80C by investing in things like Employees' Provident Fund (EPF), Public Provident Fund (PPF), Equity Linked Saving Scheme (ELSS) mutual funds, National Savings Certificate (NSC), and 5-year tax-saving fixed deposits with banks or post offices. Additionally, paying life insurance policy premiums also qualifies for tax benefits under Section 80C.It is important to note that each eligible investment comes with its specific maximum limit, rate of return, liquidity, and taxation rules for the earned returns, states ET in a report. For instance, the most you can invest in PPF in a financial year is Rs 1.5 lakh. Meanwhile, there's no limit on the amount you can invest in ELSS mutual funds, but the Section 80C deduction is capped at Rs 1.5 lakh.If individuals can't make specific investments, they can still get deductions under Section 80C from their gross taxable income through certain expenses. These expenses include repaying the principal amount of a home loan, tuition fees for children, payment of stamp duty, registration fees, and other costs related to buying a house.Since the financial year 2020-21, individuals without any business income must annually choose between the old and new tax regimes. As of the fiscal year 2023-24, the new tax regime is the default option. Consequently, individuals seeking tax deductions under Section 80C must opt for the old tax regime since this deduction isn't available in the new tax regime. It's crucial for taxpayers to be aware of these rules to make informed decisions about their tax planning and investment strategies.","Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget which is an interim budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year. The budget talks about inclusive development both, social and geographical, especially for youth, women, farmers, and the poor. Continued focus on improving logistics through infrastructure spend on roads, rail, airports, ports increases productivity for companies and citizens alike.To make ‘Viksit Bharat’ by 2047, the government’s focus is on improving and empowering people’s capabilities through various skilling initiatives. It is encouraging to see that Skill India Mission has succeeded in training more than 1.4 crore youth and upskilling and reskilling 54 lakh youth. I am particularly happy to see the continued focus on youth and women entrepreneurship and the announcement of a new fund which will give interest free 50 year loans for startups will provide a domestic fillip to startups supplementing venture capital we have traditionally relied on from abroad.PM Mudra Yojana has sanctioned 43 crore loans aggregating to 22.5 lakh crore to youth entrepreneurs and thirty crore Mudra Yojana loans to women entrepreneurs. There are several other schemes like Fund of Funds, Start-Up India, and Start-Up Credit Guarantee schemes that are assisting our youth. Further, the extension of tax benefits to Start-ups and investments made by sovereign wealth funds/pension funds, till 31st March 2025 depicts the government’s effort to support the startup eco- system.This aligns quite well with India Sanitation Coalition’s efforts to give impetus to the start-up world. Over the past 7 editions of our ISC-FICCI Sanitation Awards, we have recognized and promoted several start-ups in the sanitation space, many of whom are successful businesses now!While the finance minister did not provide detailed information on Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH), the budget allocation sees a slight increase in spend demonstrating continued focus on this highly successful program. The acknowledgement that the private sector has increasingly played a substantial role in addressing WASH issues in both urban and rural areas, with numerous projects underway through Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs), highlights the government's commitment to addressing challenges in this sector.A perfect example is the LightHouse Initiative initiated by the Department of Drinking Water along with the India Sanitation Coalition (ISC) by partnering with major corporates across India to develop model villages in Solid and Liquid Waste Management (SLWM) under SBM-Grameen. From this budget, there is an expectation that the government will persist in prioritizing Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) as the path toward achieving the country's Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6). Additionally, it is hoped that the government will uphold its commitment to making necessary infrastructural investments for SLWM.The budget speech rightly celebrates the fact that we have 83 lakh SHGs and 9 crore women beneficiaries. The microfinance movement in the country and the possibility of empowering women members of SHGs through livelihood skilling is a key to bringing women into mainstream economic advancement.The focus on green growth, rooftop solar, wind, biomass, e-vehicles all help with our green energy thrust. The tourism sector was mentioned and could be a huge job provider for youth and women.Guided by the principle ‘Reform, Perform, and Transform’, the budget emphasizes efficient implementation of various policies by improving coordination with states and relevant stakeholders. This is critical both for infra spend and social programsIt is noteworthy that ISC’s Climate Resilient Coastal Cities project which is being implemented in PPP (Public-Private Partnership) mode in four coastal states of Karnataka, Gujarat, Goa and Maharashtra is congruent with the government’s priority of promoting climate-resilient activities for the blue economy 2.0, a scheme for restoration and adaptation measures, and coastal aquaculture.The budget also focuses on the Aspirational districts program where assistance will be given to the states for faster development of aspirational districts and blocks, including the generation of ample economic opportunities. This is again very crucial as it has a huge potential to transform the landscape of our country while making sure no -one is left behind.Overall, this budget has embraced economic strategies and develops the building blocks that nurture and uphold growth, promote inclusive and sustainable development, and enhance productivity.","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year.

RBI puts curbs on 2 Edelweiss companies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rbi-puts-curbs-on-2-edelweiss-companies/articleshow/110544058.cms,"MUMBAI: The RBI has placed restrictions on two companies of the Edelweiss group - ECL Finance and Edelweiss Asset Reconstruction Company (EARCL) - over ' evergreening ' stressed loans.Evergreening of loans is the practice where lenders extend additional credit to borrowers who cannot repay their existing loans. ECL Finance offers corporate finance, loans against property and securities, MSME lending among others. EARCL is among the largest companies dealing with the purchase and recovery of bad loans from lenders.RBI has asked ECL Finance to ""cease and desist, with immediate effect, from undertaking any structured transactions in respect of its wholesale exposures, other than repayment and/or closure of accounts in its normal course of business"". EARCL has received similar orders preventing it from acquiring any new bad loans or restructuring security receipts. Security receipts are units issued to investors in bad debts, entitling the investor to a share in the recovery.RBI said that the decision to take action on ECL was based on concerns identified during supervisory examinations. This action was prompted by the coordinated conduct of Edelweiss group entities, which engaged in a series of structured transactions to artificially improve the financial health of stressed exposures of ECL. They did this by using EARCL's platform and connected alternate investment funds to bypass relevant regulations.Incorrect valuation of security receipts was observed in both ECL and EARCL. Additionally, in ECL, RBI found several issues like providing incorrect details of eligible debts to lenders for calculating borrowing limits, not following rules for loan-to-value ratios when lending against shares, incorrect reporting to the Central Repository for Information on Large Credits and not following KYC guidelines. ECL also took over loans from non-lender entities within its group to eventually sell them to the group's ARC, using this process to bypass regulations that allow ARCs to acquire financial assets only from banks and financial institutions.RBI action comes a few days after deputy governor Swaminathan J warned ARCs against circumventing rules and asked them to maintain regulatory integrity.","The RBI has placed restrictions on two companies of the Edelweiss group.

NEW DELHI: In a bid to drive in transparency and accountability in commercial messaging and tackle the menace of unsolicited consumer contact and frauds , the department of telecom ( DoT ) has decided to allocate a separate 10-digit number series starting with '160' for messaging by central and state govts, banks, insurance companies, pension providers, credit card companies, and investment advisers.

The rules are, however, silent on sectors such as real estate or utilities like electricity or gas supply companies. While the move is expected to put a check on unwanted calls, it is also meant to ensure that frauds are checked as a consumer will be able to identify if a call or a message has come from one of the regulated entities or not.

""The telecom service provider shall obtain an undertaking from the seeking entity that it will use the number assigned from the 160 series exclusively for service and transactional voice calls as per the Telecom Commercial Communication Customer Preference Regulation (TCCPR), 2018,"" the office memorandum said.

DoT believes that with a standardised numbering format, consumers will not pay heed to fraudulent entities who not only seek investments, but also lure consumers in giving out crucial personal information. Government and regulator are also looking at levying higher penalty for unsolicited calls.

Connor's determination to pursue this venture was solidified shortly after the Titan submersible disaster, which resulted in the loss of five passengers. In a call to Lahey just days after the incident, Connor expressed his desire to ""demonstrate to the world that you guys can do that,"" showcasing their capability to reach the depths of the Titanic safely.The planned vessel, named the Triton 4000/2 Abyssal Explorer, is a two-person submersible designed to dive to depths of 4,000 meters. Triton Submarines describes it as a ""high-performance, flexible platform designed specifically for professional applications."" The submersible is equipped with unique ""Gull Wings"" that raise its propulsion system away from the seabed, ensuring delicate marine life remains undisturbed during the descent.Connor shared his vision for the mission in an interview with The Wall Street Journal, saying, ""I want to show people that while the ocean is extremely powerful, it can be wonderful and enjoyable and really kind of life-changing if you go about it the right way.""

Malaysia is a major player in the semiconductor industry, accounting for 13% of global testing and packaging. It has attracted multi-billion dollar investments from leading firms in recent years, including Intel and Infineon.

Anwar said the investment being sought would be for integrated circuit design , advanced packaging and manufacturing equipment for semiconductor chips .

Malaysia also wants to establish at least 10 local companies in design and advanced packaging for semiconductor chips, with revenues between $210 million to $1 billion, Anwar said in a speech at an industry event.

The Southeast Asian country will allocate $5.3 billion in fiscal support to meet these targets, he added.

Shanghai lifts home-buying curbs to boost property sector,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/shanghai-lifts-home-buying-curbs-to-boost-property-sector/articleshow/110483968.cms,"SHANGHAI: Shanghai has relaxed rules on buying property in the city, as local governments across China aim to ease an agonising real estate crisis that is dragging on the economy.Many cities imposed restrictions and tough credit requirements on home purchases well over a decade ago in an effort to tamp down soaring prices and rampant speculation.But they are now reversing those policies in a bid to stem an economic slump characterised by a debt crisis among developers, low demand and falling prices.On Monday, economic powerhouse Shanghai -- China's largest and richest city -- said it would reduce the number of years that people were required to live there before they could buy property. Purchasers only have to have resided in the city three years, instead of five.The megacity also said it would reduce the minimum down payment for commercial housing mortgages to 20 percent, as well as permit families with two or more children to buy an additional home.The announcement followed similar moves in major Chinese cities such as Hangzhou and Xi'an this month, reducing purchase restrictions for first-time buyers.And the central government has moved in recent weeks to stem the crisis in the property and construction sector, which long accounted for a quarter of gross domestic product.This month, Beijing cut the minimum down payment rate for first-time homebuyers to its lowest level in history and suggested the government could buy up unused commercial real estate.No details were provided on how many houses would be bought.","Shanghai relaxes rules on buying property in the city.

Musk's xAI raises $6 billion from VC funds,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/musks-xai-raises-6-billion-from-vc-funds/articleshow/110479955.cms,"Elon Musk 's artificial intelligence startup xAI has raised $6 billion to accelerate its challenge to his former allies at OpenAI .

The series-B round, announced in a blog post on May 26, comes less than a year after xAI's debut and marks one of the bigger investments in the nascent field of developing AI tools. Musk had been an early supporter of AI, backing OpenAI before it introduced ChatGPT in late 2022. He later withdrew his support from the venture and has advocated caution because of the technology's potential dangers. He was among a large group of industry leaders urging a pause to AI development last year.

Musk launched a rival to OpenAI's ChatGPT in Nov, called Grok, which was trained on and integrated into X, the social network formerly known as Twitter. That has so far been the most visible product of xAI's work, which is led by executives with prior experience at Alphabet's DeepMind, Microsoft and Tesla.

The company intends to use the funds to bring its first products to market, build advanced infrastructure and accelerate the development of future technologies, it said in the blog. Its pre-money valuation was $18 billion, Musk said in a post on X. Marquee venture capital names including Sequoia Capital and Andreessen Horowitz backed the fundraising, which is one of the largest so far in the industry. Microsoft has invested about $13 billion in OpenAI, while Amazon put about $4 billion into Anthropic.

As Bitcoin recently gathered bullish momentum and surged beyond the $70,000 mark, other altcoins like Litecoin , Stellar , Avalanche and the new meme coin KangaMoon are also being propelled by this surge. Let us find out why.The Bitcoin price fought to stay over $70,000 on May 22 as Glassnode analysts speculated that the pioneer cryptocurrency was getting ready for a ""bigger move"" upward. Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView data indicate that following a protracted decline from all-time highs, the Bitcoin price has been rising steadily, as evident on the Bitcoin price chart.Glassnode reports that although most important on-chain measures are moving toward equilibrium, Bitcoin's recent recovery to $71,000 is the result of ""compression of volatility"" and easing sell-side pressure. Glassnode analysts saw a “large decline” in the one- and two-year cohorts over the past two months using the Supply Last Active Age Band indicator.In case Bitcoin keeps rising to $73,000, the Litecoin price may have upward momentum since it recently tested the bottom limit of the daily Ichimoku cloud. The lower limit of the Ichimoku cloud serves as an important support level, and keeping a position above it is necessary to keep a bullish trend going. Should the Litecoin price be able to penetrate the cloud, it may advance toward the $93 crucial resistance level.With further support around $85.70 as seen on the Litecoin price chart, the altcoin may go towards the major resistance level around $93. Maintaining the upward trend therefore depends on keeping above the cloud. A first line of protection for Litecoin is the 38.2% Fibonacci level at $85.09. Should this support be breached, the trend may be deteriorating and more selling pressure may be introduced.With the recent deployment of Protocol 21 by the Stellar (XLM) testnet, its main network made a major stride. A mainnet vote is planned for June 18, 2024, and this update includes important features like passkey signing and cheaper smart contract transactions. These improvements are meant to greatly increase the Stellar network efficiency and reduce running costs.Moreover, the continuous dedication of the Stellar network to increasing worldwide access to and affordability of financial services is reflected in Protocol 21. Stellar is carefully improving its infrastructure to support a larger, more inclusive financial ecosystem by putting CAPs 0054, 0055, and 0056 into place, while nevertheless keeping costs low for users worldwide. Amid these, the Stellar price has seen a notable rise by 3% to $0.11 per token within the past week.For weeks, the Avalanche price has stayed between $30 and $40. The Avalanche price dropped to the $35 area in March after rising above $60, and it has subsequently had difficulty breaking beyond the $40 barrier. Nonetheless, recent positive trends suggest that there may be a rally to retake the $40 mark.At $39.91, Avalanche has increased in its price by over 15% during the last week while the Avalanche market cap has also risen slightly by 0.65% to reach $15.68 billion. Moreover, the price of Avalanche might reach its March high of $60.69 if sentiment in the larger cryptocurrency market improves.Because of its presale performance, KangaMoon (KANG) has become more well-known to the general public amid the current meme coin craze. In addition, KANG has almost hit $7 million. Furthermore, there are presently over 32,000 registered KangaMoon users. The primary goal of KangaMoon is to profit from the Play-to-Earn (P2E) gaming market, which is expected to generate $8856 million by 2028.The group intends to develop a play-to-earn (P2E) game in which users may purchase items with KANG and level up their characters. KANG will gain from this development, and it will gain more than 99% of other hype-driven memecoins . The SocialFi aspect of KangaMoon is what distinguishes it from other projects.Put another way, prior to debut, KangaMoon is giving out free KANG based on how much people interact on its social media channels, which include Telegram and X. As a result, a large number of individuals are appreciating and sharing KangaMoon's social media content. Each KANG is currently valued at $0.025—400% higher than its initial pricing of $0.005—during the bonus stage of its presale.Analysts, however, predict that KANG might rise 100x after it is listed on a Tier-1 CEX like BitMart, which has announced the meme coin's listing. This might just be the start. Moreover, KangaMoon is already listed on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko. Considering that fans of cryptocurrencies are anticipating a sharp increase in value, KANG is among the best meme coins to buy now.Among the most promising memecoins, KangaMoon has already attracted the interest of numerous investors. Furthermore, because KangaMoon now has a small market capitalization, inflating the token's price is less expensive. Because of this, experts believe that after KANG is listed on BitMart , its price will soar above $1.Click here to know more.","The Bitcoin price fought to stay over $70,000 on May 22 as Glassnode analysts speculated that the pioneer cryptocurrency was getting ready for a ""bigger move"" upward.

The more-active August contract rose 25 cents to $82.09.US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose 24 cents to $77.96.Brent ended last week about 2% lower and WTI lost nearly 3% after Federal Reserve minutes showed some officials would be willing to tighten interest rates further if they believed it was necessary to control persistent inflation.Public holidays in the US and UK on Monday are expected to keep trading relatively thin.The upcoming meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, known as OPEC+, was pushed back by a day and will be held online, OPEC said on Friday.The producers will discuss whether to extend voluntary output cuts of 2.2 million barrels per day into the second half of the year, with three sources from OPEC+ countries saying an extension was likely.Oil futures are expected to maintain today's gains due expectations of the cuts being extended, said Sugandha Sachdeva, founder of Delhi-based research firm SS WealthStreet.""However, the trajectory of price action will be significantly influenced by the US Producer Price Index (PPI) data scheduled for the week, which will in turn shape the Federal Reserve's approach to potential rate adjustments,"" Sachdeva said.Combined with another 3.66 million bpd of production cuts valid through the end of the year, the output cuts are equivalent to nearly 6% of global oil demand.OPEC has said it expects another year of relatively strong growth in oil demand of 2.25 million bpd, while the International Energy Agency expects much slower growth of 1.2 million bpd.ANZ analysts said in a note that they will be watching gasoline usage as the Northern Hemisphere enters summer, traditionally a high season due to driving holidays.""While US holiday trips are expected to hit a post-COVID high, improved fuel efficiency and EVs could see oil demand remain soft,"" the analysts said. But they added that could be offset by rising air travel.Markets will also be watching the US personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index this week for more signals about interest rate policy.
