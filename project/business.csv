NEW DELHI: Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Tuesday presented the Union Budget 2024 in Parliament. In the first budget of Modi 3.0, Sitharaman announced several key decisions that focused on nine areas including the agriculture, manufacturing, and services sectors. She also announced major changes in the capital gains tax regime and income tax regimes.“The people have given a unique opportunity to our government to take the country on the path of strong development and all-round prosperity,” FM Nirmala Sitharaman said.India's inflation rate is stable and moving toward the government's 4% target, she said, while the economy grew at a sizzling 8.2% rate in the last fiscal year.“India’s economic growth continues to be the shining exception and will remain so in the years ahead,” the finance minister said.The government announced the revised tax slab for the new tax regime. The new income tax regime tax slabs are: Up to Rs 3 lakh the tax is NIL; From Rs 3 lakh to Rs 7 lakh the tax rate is 5 per cent ; From Rs 7 lakh to Rs 10 lakh the tax rate is 10 per cent; From Rs 10 lakh to Rs 12 lakh the tax rate is 15 per cent; From Rs 12 lakh to Rs 15 lakh the tax rate is 20 per cent ; Above Rs 15 lakh income the tax rate is 30 per cent.Sitharaman also announced relief on standard deduction which has been hiked from Rs 50,000 currently to Rs 75,000 now.

First, the standard deduction for salaries employees is proposed to be increased from Rs 50,000 to Rs 75,000. Similarly, deduction on family pension for pensioners is proposed to be enhanced from Rs 15,000 to Rs 25,000. This will provide relief to about 4 crore salaries individuals and pensioners,"" finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said.The first budget of Modi 3.0 gave major boost to Bihar and Andhra Pradesh with announcement of special financial support.The announcement covered human resource development, infrastructure and the generation of economic opportunities to make the eastern region of the country covering Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Odisha and Andhra Pradesh an engine to attain Viksit Bharat.The government announced assistance of Rs 15,000 crore to develop capital city in Andhra Pradesh and to finance Polavaram irrigation project.

""To provide relief to cancer patients, I propose to fully exempt three more medicines from customs duties,"" Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said while presenting the Union Budget for 2024-25 in the Lok Sabha.The custom duties on Trastuzumab Deruxtecan, Osimertinib and Durvalumab will be dropped from 10 per cent to nil.The basic customs duty (BCD) on x-ray tubes and flat panel detectors for use in medical x-ray machines under the phased manufacturing programme will also be changed, so as to synchronise them with domestic capacity addition.""My proposals for customs duties intend to support domestic manufacturing, deepen local value addition, promote export-competitiveness, and simplify taxation, while keeping the interest of the general public and consumers surmount,"" Sitharaman said.In her Budget speech, Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman outlined a plan to generate employment opportunities for approximately 4.1 crore youth over the next five years. To support this initiative, the government has allocated Rs 2 lakh crore.Additionally, the finance minister proposed Rs 1.48 crore for skilling citizens to create job opportunities, with the goal of skilling 20 lakh youth over a five-year period. She also announced the upgrading of 1,000 industrial training institutes. Sitharaman proposed providing a one-time wage to all first-time employees across all sectors, with the incentive being delivered through Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT). The finance minister announced the launch of internship opportunities in 500 companies for one crore youth over five years. ""Interns will get exposure to real-life environments and an allowance of Rs 5000 per month,"" she said. The companies will cover the training costs, with 10 percent of the training cost coming from CSR funds.Sitharaman said the government has provided special attention to MSMEs and labour-intensive manufacturing and formulated a package covering financial and technological support to the sector.She announced a Credit Guarantee scheme of Rs 100 crore for MSMEs, building in-house capabilities, and a paradigm shift in the credit assessment model for credit eligibility.""For facilitating term loans to MSMEs, a credit guarantee scheme will be introduced. The scheme will operate on the cooling of credit risks of such MSMEs. A self-financing guarantee fund will provide to each applicant cover of up to Rs 100 crore while loan amount may be larger,"" she said.In a major boost to the employment and skill development sector, finance minister Sitharaman said that the government is set to launch an internship scheme for one crore youths in over 500 firms.""The Government will launch a scheme to provide internship opportunities to 1 crore youth in 500 top companies with Rs 5000 per month as internship allowance and one-time assistance of Rs 6000,"" she said.Sitharaman announced that the government will offer financial assistance for loans up to Rs 10 lakh for higher education in domestic institutions.

In addition to this, the finance minister also outlined several initiatives for the Skill Development sector.These include the upgrading of 1,000 Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) using the hub and spoke model, aligning course content with the skill requirements of the industry, and revising the model skill loan scheme.In a major relief for the startup ecosystem, the Union finance minister announced to abolish angel tax to further boost local talent and innovation.The industry had sought rationalisation of Angel Tax by removing Section 56(2)(viib) in order to further nurture innovation among startups, saying scrapping this section would ""greatly aid in capital formation"" for the startup sector.Under Section 56(2) (viib) of the Income Tax Act, to become eligible for angel tax exemption, a startup must meet certain conditions which the industry claims are cumbersome and come in the way of attracting more investments.Imported mobile phones, gold, silver and other precious metals are set to become cheaper with the finance minister announcing cuts in custom duty in the Union Budget. The government has reduced customs duty on such shipments to 15 per cent from 20 per cent earlier.Sitharaman in her budget speech also proposed reducing ""customs duties on gold and silver to 6 per cent and that on platinum to 6.4 per cent"" to enhance domestic value addition for jewellery in the country.Meanwhile, the finance minister said that the government would strive to further simplify and rationalise the GST tax structure.However, certain items such as imported garden umbrellas and laboratory chemicals are set to become costlier due to an increase in basic customs duty.","The first budget of Modi 3.0 gave major boost to Bihar and Andhra Pradesh with announcement of special financial support. Three cancer medicines were fully exempted from custom duties, Sitharaman announced.

New Tax Regime: What else can be done?

Income Tax Expectations Budget 2024 : The Modi government has been looking to make the new income tax regime more attractive for the common man, middle class and salaried income taxpayers. Raising of basic exemption limit , introduction of standard deduction , and tweaking of tax slabs and rates under the new tax regime signal that the government wants taxpayers to shift to the new regime.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present the Union Budget 2024 on July 23, 2024 and personal tax experts are of the opinion that some changes in the new income tax regime can be expected.What can be done to make the new income tax regime more attractive than the old tax regime, especially for individuals who have done their tax planning based on the old regime? TOI Online Survey of personal tax experts finds out:Also Check | Budget 2024 Live Updates All personal tax experts unanimously agree that to make the new income tax more attractive for taxpayers, especially for middle class salaried taxpayers , the government needs to tweak it to introduce more deductions and exemptions.One common deduction that experts believe should make way into the new income tax regime, and one that makes the old tax regime more lucrative for taxpayers, is housing loan deduction.Preeti Sharma, Partner, Tax & Regulatory Services, BDO India LLP says that currently under the new tax regime, exemption against interest paid on home loan taken for a self-occupied or vacant property is not available. “This provision may be relooked at and be allowed under the new tax regime,” she tells TOI.Agrees Kuldip Kumar, Partner at Mainstay Tax Advisors, saying, “the deduction for interest on housing loan may be introduced to make it (new tax regime) better for those who still chose the old tax regime.”Also Read | Income Tax Expectations Budget 2024: What are the ideal new tax regime slabs, rates for middle class, salaried? TOI Online Survey findings Yet another recommendation is to increase the basic exemption limit and standard deduction under the new regime.“Increase in the basic exemption limit from Rs 3 to 5 lakhs, raise the standard deduction to Rs 100,000,” Surabhi Marwah, Tax Partner, EY India tells TOI.Chander Talreja, Partner, Vialto Partners says that the basic exemption limit under the new tax regime may be further raised by at least Rs 50,000, which will benefit all individual taxpayers (salaried or non-salaried) opting for the new income tax regime. This will help increase purchasing power of the taxpayers which may further boost the investments.Aarti Raote, Partner, Deloitte India says raising the basic exemption limit to Rs 5 lakh and introducing the 30% tax rate to the income category of Rs 20 lakh & above as against the existing limit of Rs 15 lakh will give tax relief to all. She also believes that the standard deduction should be increased to Rs 1 lakh from the existing Rs 50,000 limit.Aarti Raote is of the view that to make the new regime more attractive the government should consider allowing deductions for employee contributions to the NPS within the new tax regime framework.Vialto’s Chander Talreja notes that the employer’s contribution to the NPS is allowed as a deduction under the new income tax regime. “For the non-salaried individuals, while this deduction is not applicable, they do not even get any deduction for their own contribution. This is a hardship and the government may consider introducing deduction in respect of an individual's contribution to NPS under section 80CCD(1B), currently capped at Rs 50,000. This will benefit salaried as well as non-salaried individuals,” he tells TOI.Also Read | Budget 2024 income tax expectations: Raise basic exemption limit, standard deduction and NPS benefits for taxpayers Preeti Sharma believes that in order to promote savings towards retirement, the government may consider allowing deductions available under section 80C of the Act, under the new tax regime as well.Aarti Raote says that in line with the government’s agenda of affordable housing and green energy, it is anticipated that specific deductions towards mortgage repayments on affordable housing or electric vehicles be provided under the new tax regime besides incentivizing taxpayers for installation or adoption of solar energy equipment.However, Kuldip Kumar, Partner at Mainstay Tax Advisors notes that the government has already rationalized the slabs and the rates in its Budget 2023. “I am not expecting that something more would be done except discontinuing the old tax regime whereby by default everyone is in the new regime,” he tells TOI.","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present the Union Budget 2024 on July 23, 2024.

Big tax boost lets Nirmala raise Capex & yet cut deficit sharply,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/big-tax-boost-lets-nirmala-raise-capex-yet-cut-deficit-sharply/articleshow/111973592.cms,"How has this been possible?

The Budget for 2024-25 looks at first glance like a finance minister’s dream come true. Nirmala Sitharaman has been able to sharply raise the outlay on capital expenditure , which is spending on creating productive assets, over the “provisional actual” (PA) figures for 2023-24 without resorting to borrowing more.As a result, she has been able to project a dramatic cut in fiscal deficit .Let’s look at the receipts side of the Budget to begin with. Revenue receipts are projected to rise about 15% over PA 2023-24 from Rs 27.3 lakh crore to Rs 31.3 lakh crore.Part of this is to come from higher tax receipts, which Sitharaman estimates will rise by 11% from Rs 23.3 lakh crore to Rs 25.8 lakh crore after the share of states has been accounted for. The rise in tax revenues, in turn, is projected to happen largely because of individual income tax collections rising by almost 14% from Rs 10.4 lakh crore to Rs 11.9 lakh crore. income tax on corporates as well as goods and services tax (GST) are expected to record more modest increases of about 12% and 11%, respectively.Non-tax revenues are expected to go up even more sharply from Rs 4 lakh crore to Rs 5.5 lakh crore. This is mainly because dividends and profits that govt earns from the public sector and Reserve Bank of India are slated to jump 70% from Rs 1.7 lakh crore to Rs 2.9 lakh crore, most of this being on account of the record divi dends from RBI.In contrast to revenue receipts, capital receipts are expected to decline a touch from Rs 17.1 lakh crore to Rs 16.9 lakh crore despite “miscellaneous capital receipts” (essentially proceeds of divestment of govt equity in public sector firms) rising from Rs 33,122 crore to Rs 50,000 crore. The decline is mainly expected to come due to reduced borrowings – Rs 16.1 lakh crore compared to Rs 16.5 lakh crore in PA 2023-24.Total receipts, the summation of revenue and capital receipts, are therefore projected to rise 8.5% from Rs 44.4 lakh crore to Rs 48.2 lakh crore. As a result, the FM has been able to provide Rs 15 lakh crore for “effective capital expenditure”, which includes grants-in-aid for creation of capital assets, and yet cut fiscal deficit – in essence the gap between total expenditure and receipts that do not involve aliability for the future – to 4.9% of GDP from 5.6% last year. That 0.7 percentage point drop represents the sharpest cut in deficit in over a decade if we exclude the cut in 2021-22 after the Covid-induced spending surge in 2020-21. The revenue deficit, which economists consider perhaps an even more important measure of fiscal health, is also estimated to come down from 2.6% of GDP to 1.8%.","The Budget for 2024-25 looks at first glance like a finance minister’s dream come true.

"Debt, not deficit, to be fiscal health check parameter",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/debt-not-deficit-to-be-fiscal-health-check-parameter/articleshow/111973623.cms,"Centre on Tuesday indicated a major transition from using fiscal deficit as a measure of fiscal health to debt-GDP ratio being the anchor of fiscal management in the coming years as it vowed to stick to its fiscal consolidation plan and kept the deficit at 4.9% of gross domestic product (GDP), lower than the interim budget estimate of 5.1% for 2024-25.“Hereafter, it is not the intention to focus on a deficit number, but look at what will reduce our debt-GDP ratio in normal years. The reason for this is a fixed figure enshrined in the FRBM Act does not take into account the debt dynamics of a fast-growing economy like India,” finance secretary T V Somanathan told a news conference.He said the 3% target is often attributed to the Maastricht Treaty in Europe, but the growth rate of those countries are very low. India is the fastest-growing major economy in the world and the deficit it can support in a particular year without expanding its debt is not necessarily 3%, but much more. Each year’s calibration will be based on what will be the debt that will keep it on a reducing path, Somanathan added. While this will require amendments to the FRBM Act, the move has not been taken up for now.Sitharaman said in her Budget speech, “The fiscal consolidation path announced by me in 2021 has served our economy very well, and we aim to reach a deficit below 4.5% next year. The govt is committed to staying the course. From 2026-27 onwards, our endeavour will be to keep the fiscal deficit each year such that the central govt debt will be on a declining path as percentage of GDP.”Robust tax revenues and higher dividend payout of Rs 2.11 lakh crore by the Reserve Bank of India has also helped govt in its fiscal consolidation plan.The move to persist with fiscal consolidation was cheered by ratings agencies.“Policy continuity is reflected in govt’s capital spending on infrastructure which remains around 23% of total expenditure, although this remains below the 24% spending on interest payments,” said Gene Fang, associate managing director, Moody’s Ratings. Moody’s Rating said it projects general govt debt to stabilise above 80% of GDP over the next three years, down from 89.3% in fiscal 2020-21.","Finance secretary T V Somanathan said the 3% target is often attributed to the Maastricht Treaty in Europe, but the growth rate of those countries are very low.

Fertiliser subsidy is queering the pitch for agricultural sector's growth,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/fertiliser-subsidy-is-queering-the-pitch-for-agri-sectors-growth/articleshow/111973629.cms,"The finance minister has announced an allocation of Rs 1.52 lakh crore for agriculture and allied sectors in FY 25, constituting 3.1% of the total expenditure of Rs 48.2 lakh crore. This marks only a slight increase from Rs 1.4 lakh crore in the revised estimate (RE, FY24).It hardly adjusts for inflation. Additionally, Nirmala Sitharaman stated that over the next two years, one crore farmers will be introduced to natural farming practices .However, this raises concern, given the budget of Rs 1.64 lakh crore earmarked for fertiliser subsidy in FY25. This subsidy allocation surpasses the total budgetary allocation for agriculture and allied sectors in FY25. Such a discrepancy prompts critical reflection on fertiliser subsidy and raises questions between promoting sustainable farming practices and subsidising granular fertilisers , especially urea, which can have adverse effects on soil health.It is noteworthy that granular urea, as currently applied in fields, is not fully utilised by crops. Estimates of nutrient use efficiency (NUE) indicate only around 35% of nitrogenous urea is absorbed by crops. Since temperature is high, most of the urea will volatilise as ammonia (NH3), nitrogen gas (N2), and nitrous oxide (N2O) gases. Ammonia, upon oxidation, transforms into nitrate (NO3), which is 273 times the carbon equivalence causing global warming. Besides, a portion of applied fertiliser nitrogen is leached into groundwater, rendering it non-potable due to high nitrate content.When fertiliser subsidy was introduced in the 1970s, the ratio of grain yield to fertiliser application was 10:1. Over time, this ratio has dwindled to 2:1. One might question why our policymakers are reluctant to explore alternatives. Fertiliser subsidy should be transferred from ministry of chemicals and fertilisers to ministry of agriculture to ensure direct disbursement to farmers. This step, combined with deregulating prices of specific fertilisers, has the potential to encourage equitable pricing and usage, potentially leading to savings in subsidies.The FM could also consider digitising the distribution process by providing electronic vouchers or coupons that can be used to purchase fertilisers from registered agri-input dealers. This will eliminate leakages and diversions.According to the last two input-output tables of the country, around 20-30% of nitrogenous fertilisers meant for agriculture are being diverted elsewhere - unrelated industries like plywood and glass manufacturing or to neighbouring countries.The Economic Survey 2024 underscored the pressing need for reforms in fertiliser administration. It presented two key policy recommendations. One WAS to leverage Agri Stack, a robust digital platform well-established in major states, to enhance targeting of fertiliser subsidies. Agri Stack enables precise identification of eligible farmers and regulation of fertiliser quantities based on land ownership and primary crops cultivated.The other was adoption of E RUPI, on the lines of e-coupons, to digitally transfer flexible input subsidies directly to farmers' registered bank accounts. This subsidy can be utilised by farmers using authorised PoS machines to purchase fertilisers and other essential items like seeds and pesticides from authorised outlets.However, for these reforms to succeed, it is crucial to integrate farmers' credentials such as Aadhar, mobile number, and bank accounts with all agricultural land owned by them.(Gulati & Juneja are distinguished professor and fellow, ICRIER, respectively.

Budget's big job: Get back BJP's lost votes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budgets-big-job-get-back-bjps-lost-votes/articleshow/111973325.cms,"The best clue to the politics of this Budget ? The acronym emblazoned on the backdrop of Nirmala Sitharaman 's post-Budget presser. First letters of ten different 'priorities' made up that acronym - EMPLOYMENT.Fresh from an where BJP lost its single party majority in part because many voters were unhappy with the lack of decent paying jobs , FM wrote that political lesson into her Budget, via a raft of incentives for industry, both big and small, to employ more people.In a country where the young are the largest population cohort, disaffected young people are a political handicap. More so, when millions of them are college-educated and therefore relatively immune to the promise of welfare schemes. So, Sitharaman put their concerns front and centre, to win back votes that in 2014 and 2019 had played a pivotal role in giving BJP impressive majorities.What will be interesting is how the Budget's unconventional approach to job creation pans out, both in terms of actual jobs created and politically. FM has bet on incentives for private sector employers. If companies respond - and that's a definite 'if' - there will be job creation in the formal sector.There's a rider here. What happens if companies don't respond to the nudges GOI has given on taking on more people? Will the nudge become something stronger?The key question is 'how many jobs'. Because politically, for the Budget to make an appreciable difference to the perception that Modi govt ignored unemployment, a substantial number of new, steady jobs will have to be offered by the private sector. This question is even sharper politically when it comes to the internship programme. After one year, will the new interns get jobs? Or will they be unemployed young people with job experience? If most interns end up in the latter category, BJP's political difficulty over the jobs question may not lessen dramatically.This will be true even if BJP's own argument - that it didn't get enough credit for creating an enabling environment for creating jobs in sectors like the gig economy - remains valid.The Budget takes forward previous attempts on skilling by announcing new schemes. GOI's skilling programmes have had a patchy record so far. If this Budget changes that, many young voters will have a better shot at earning a decent livelihood. That has an obvious positive political impact.The catch, of course, is whether this Budget will do this job more skilfully than previous ones.There's a clear political plan in the Budget's MSME approach, too. First, because labour-intensive MSMEs, now helped by a friendlier credit regime, are reliable job-creators. Second, because MSME promoters contain a large subset of small businessmen generally thought to be sympathetic to BJP.Ally management was always going to be a priority for a coalition govt's budget. On this, Sitharaman's politics is better than that of many other coalition govt FMs. Instead of giving big bags of money to Nitish and Naidu, the budget allocates capex for specific projects, ensuring the help to allies is in tune with the larger focus of building infra, and also trying to ensure that whatever's allocated is spent better. Roads, bridges in Bihar and big irrigation projects in Andhra can deliver both politically and economically. Plus, it's also fiscally prudent.To that extent, therefore, Congress's charge that this was a 'save the govt"" scheme needs to be qualified.Women, who are voting in larger numbers in every successive election, are another big political constituency. The Budget allocates Rs 3 lakh crore for schemes for women and girls. These are likely to be implemented through self-help groups. These schemes aim to double down on the success of both labharti and lakhpati didi initiatives. 2024 elections showed that women vote can act as a counter in regions where other voter groups are dissatisfied with BJP.The investing classes won't be too happy about the Budget, what with capital gains tax burden going up. Urban middle classes, too, will grumble about the smallish tax benefits accruing from tweaks in income taxes. But these are not the voting classes. Right now, BJP wants to get back the votes it lost - that's, basically, the politics of this budget.","The Budget's unconventional approach to job creation pans out, both in terms of actual jobs created and politically.

As Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman gears up to present the Union Budget 2024 today, India's electric vehicle (EV) industry is on high alert for pivotal policy decisions . Having experienced remarkable growth recently, the sector is at a critical point where continued government backing is crucial for sustaining this momentum.The Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid & Electric Vehicles (FAME) India scheme, which has been a cornerstone in promoting EVs, ended on March 31, 2024.Despite its success, the industry still grapples with issues like inadequate charging infrastructure and high battery costs. To further support the sector, the Ministry of Heavy Industries (MHI) introduced the Electric Mobility Promotion Scheme (EMPS) with a budget of Rs. 500 crore, set to expire on July 31, 2024. This scheme provides subsidies for two- and three-wheeler EVs, aiming to boost their adoption and manufacturing in India.Madhumita Agrawal, Founder and CEO of Oben Electric, highlights the financial strain on manufacturers due to the disparity in GST rates on raw materials and finished vehicles. ""We hope the budget will address this disparity to reduce the burden on manufacturers, eventually transferring the cost benefit to the consumer,"" she says.Similarly, Akash Gupta, Co-founder and CEO of Zypp Electric, stresses the need for policy continuity to achieve net-zero carbon emissions. He advocates for the inclusion of EV services in the priority lending scheme and a reduction in GST from 18% to 5% to accelerate EV adoption in delivery services.As the Union Budget 2024 is unveiled, the EV industry looks forward to measures that will enhance growth, address supply chain challenges, and promote sustainable mobility. This is a developing story. Stay tuned to this space for all the latest updates around the automotive sector from Nirmala Sitharaman's milestone seventh budget presentation.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has proposed a complete exemption from custom duties on lithium—a key component for several sectors, including the electric vehicle (EV) industry—as well as on copper, cobalt, and rare earth elements. Additionally, she has suggested reducing the basic customs duty (BCD) on two of these materials.Rajat Mahajan, Partner, Deloitte India: Government is incentivizing the job creation in the manufacturing sector which is likely to impact 30Lakh youth.

Exporters are also dissatisfied with the new taxes on their income.The annual inflation rate for FY24 stood at 23.4%, leaving the real interest rate negative by three per cent.""How can we expect any big cut in the interest rate in the future to stimulate the economy?"" the banker questioned.The sources said that the IMF has asked the State Bank to maintain fiscal discipline, implying no substantial relief in interest rates soon.The high cost of doing business has already led to economic contraction in FY23, with a mere 2.4 per cent growth in FY24.""If the political situation remains unstable, significant growth in FY25 is unlikely, which will increase unemployment and deepen political uncertainties,"" noted an analyst. The IMF projects 3.5% growth for FY25, while Fitch Ratings estimates 3.2%.Faisal Mamsa, CEO of Tresmark, showed optimism and said that the IMF deal will unlock additional funding sources, stabilise the rupee and bolster foreign exchange reserves.However, he expressed concerns about the political and social challenges in the country, which could complicate the successful implementation of IMF conditions, as reported by Dawn.""Moody's points out that Pakistan has historically struggled with implementing the structural reforms required by IMF programmes, which casts doubt on the current deal's effectiveness,"" he said.Despite campaigns for deals with Saudi Arabia, UAE and China, no substantial progress has been made, nor has privatisation of any government entity gone through, Mamsa said, adding that the anti-poor budget may not be sustainable in the long term.","The current fiscal year's tax-laden budget and the Supreme Court's ruling on reserved seats have shifted the focus of politics to the economy.

It enables miners to track how much production quota a miner has left for the period and to alert authorities should there be discrepancies in output and sales data, he added.A senior official has said Jakarta will implement the system on other minerals such as bauxite and copper, but the timing would be decided later on, once the nickel and tin tracking system has run smoothly.","Indonesia is the world's biggest producer of nickel and one of its largest producers of tin.

Stock traders in Asia are ramping up the Trump trade in preparation for a potential second term for the former US president, which will likely create winners and losers in the region.Donald Trump ’s “America first” policies on trade, defense and other industries would hamper the outlook of a myriad of sectors in Asia from agriculture and farm equipment to textiles and weapons production.Asian companies’ momentum in the global race for electric vehicles and chips could slow should a Trump administration follow through on his pledges.China is seen as a clear loser given Trump’s call for higher tariffs and confrontational rhetoric against the world’s second largest economy. Taiwan and South Korea, which are heavily reliant on export revenues from semiconductor and other tech sectors, are also staring at an outlook downturn, market watchers say.India is deemed as a potential beneficiary should the former US president’s polling hold up and lead to his win in November. Southeast Asian economies, whose fortunes aren’t closely tied to exports, may be able to deflect much of the fallout from a change in the White House, investors say.Here is what market watchers are saying“India stands out as an economy that is relatively shielded from these shocks as the country has only a small share of global goods markets and is less exposed to China-related risks.”“It looks like India has a much better relationship with the US than China. At least from India’s side, the impact of Trump was not as bad as it was for many other emerging markets. It’s difficult to think it’ll be different this time.”“China’s obviously going to be one of the most affected if those tariffs really come in place and if Trump successfully can put enough pressure on the EU to also put some tariffs of their own on China.”Still, “a lot of companies are diversifying their markets or starting to diversify the supply chains and build manufacturing facilities outside of China. And even if a Trump presidency imposes high tariffs, Europe might decide not to follow it unless there is some really super strong political pressure.”“For Japan, we believe that risks are more balanced than China as the country’s sensitivity to global trade is a bit lower, and its relations with the US will likely remain solid even under the Trump administration.”“We also see the opportunity for the country to cement its semiconductor sector renaissance if Taiwan or South Korea end up bearing the brunt of the Trump team’s potentially consequential re-calibration of the US strategy for them.”“In Asia, the biggest beneficiaries are likely to be Vietnam, Taiwan, and Malaysia. Vietnam has been benefiting from the lower-end manufacturing, such as textile and wooden furniture, while Taiwan and Malaysia have been benefiting from electronic products supply chain shifts.”“Southeast Asia will be in a pretty good position because of what’s happening with China. So in that sense, Southeast Asia would be good. Thailand even, well, Vietnam may get into some trouble because they’re doing so much manufacturing of Chinese goods, but they’re also doing a lot of manufacturing for Korea.”“For Asia, it would really affect the tech-related ones more. It’s really whether the momentum trade of Taiwan, Korea is going to continue a bit longer, versus Asean being a bit more resilient, less tied to the tech sector, and having the China plus one strategy and secular themes playing out.”","Donald Trump ’s “America first” policies on trade, defense and other industries would hamper the outlook of a myriad of sectors in Asia. China is seen as a clear loser given Trump’s call for higher tariffs and confrontational rhetoric. Taiwan and South Korea, which are heavily reliant on export revenues from semiconductor and other tech sectors, are also staring at an outlook downturn.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111831078,imgsize-59226,width-400,resizemode-4/111831078.jpg"

Bank Of England: UK inflation holds at 2% but underlying price pressures stay strong,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/uk-inflation-holds-at-2-but-underlying-price-pressures-stay-strong/articleshow/111806256.cms,"British inflation held at 2.0 per cent last month, defying forecasts for a slight fall, and underlying price pressures persisted, maintaining uncertainty about the date of the Bank of England 's first interest rate cut since 2020.Economists polled by Reuters had mostly expected headline consumer price inflation would ease to 1.9per cent in the 12 months to June, extending its drop from a peak of 11.1per cent in October 2022.Inflation for services was much stronger at 5.7 per cent, the Office for National Statistics said, unchanged from May. The Reuters poll had pointed to a slightly weaker 5.6per cent increase.Sterling rose against the dollar immediately after the data was published.The BoE - which has a target of consumer price inflation of 2 per cent - has expressed concern about the strength of services inflation, which largely reflects pressure from wage growth in a labour market short of candidates to fill jobs.Data due on Thursday is expected to show wages growing slightly less strongly than in data published a month ago but still rising by almost 6per cent - roughly double the rate that would be compatible with keeping inflation at 2per cent.The BoE is due to announce its next decision on interest rates on Aug. 1 and investors see a roughly 50per cent chance of a first cut to borrowing costs since 2020.A rate cut next month would give an early boost to new Prime Minister Keir Starmer and his finance minister Rachel Reeves who have said they will speed up the slow-moving British economy after winning power in a landslide election two weeks ago.But last week the BoE's Chief Economist, Huw Pill, said he was focused on persistently strong price pressures and said the timing of the first rate cut was an open question.Core inflation - excluding volatile food and energy prices - held at 3.5 per cent in the 12 months to June, the ONS said, matching the median forecast in the Reuters poll.The BoE had expected headline inflation of 2.0 per cent in June and services inflation of 5.1per cent, according to forecasts it published two months ago. The BoE also expected headline inflation to rise back above its target later this year and through 2025.","Inflation for services was much stronger at 5.7 per cent, the Office for National Statistics said. The BoE is due to announce its next decision on interest rates on Aug. 1.
