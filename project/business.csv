SME IPOs: Note of caution

SME IPOs frenzy: The once-exclusive domain of high net worth individuals (HNIs), initial public offerings (IPOs) of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are now attracting a surge of interest from ordinary retail investors . These investors are drawn to the potential for substantial gains when the shares first begin trading on the stock exchange.According to an ET report, the number of applicants for these high-risk share sales has skyrocketed in recent years.In FY20, an average of just 408 individuals applied for each SME IPO, rising slightly to 511 in FY21. However, in the current fiscal year, FY25, the average number of applicants has soared to an astonishing 219,000 per offering.Despite the inherent risks and the requirement to invest a minimum of Rs 1 lakh, retail investors have not been deterred.The average gain on listing price in FY25 stands at an impressive 76%, with some IPOs, such as Hoac Foods India, Medicamen Organics, Koura Fine Diamond Jewelry, and Maxposure, seeing the retail portion oversubscribed by more than a thousand times.The surge in retail interest began in earnest in FY23, fueled by significant rallies and substantial listing gains in certain issuances. In FY22, the average number of applications was 6,042, with average listing gains of 19%. This momentum continued in FY23, with the average number of applications rising to 31,500 and listing gains increasing to 29%. FY24 saw even more impressive figures, with average listing gains exceeding 50% and the number of applications reaching 113,000 per IPO.Pranav Haldea, managing director of PRIME Database Group, attributes this enthusiasm to the allure of potential gains in a bullish market.Also Read | These mutual funds have returned 100% more than Nifty! Where should investors put their SIP money? He was quoted as saying, ""In a bullish market, investors tend to invest in all IPOs, hoping for allotments in some, due to the high likelihood of listing gains."" He also notes that the simplicity of investing through trading apps has made the process more accessible, requiring just a few clicks and allowing funds to remain in the investor's bank account until allotment.The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has issued a cautionary advisory regarding investments in securities of companies listed in the SME segment. This comes in response to the frenzy surrounding SME IPOs. Sebi stated that certain SME companies and their promoters have been employing tactics to present a misleadingly positive picture of their operations, and then capitalizing on this momentum to offload their own holdings at a profit.Also Read | Who are India’s richest investors? These top individual investors made more money in June quarter In an effort to bring more stability to the opening price discovery process for SME stocks, the National Stock Exchange implemented a cap of 90% over the offer price for SME IPOs during a special pre-open session on listing day in early July. It is noteworthy that approximately 60 IPOs this year listed between 90% and 400% above the issue price.Several market experts have also advised retail investors to exercise caution in this regard.Haldea, highlights a pressing concern. ""What is even more troubling is that many retail investors today are relatively new entrants, having opened their demat accounts only in the last 3-4 years. Consequently, they have not experienced significant market corrections or major frauds, which make them more susceptible to risks,"" he said.",SME IPOs are now attracting interest from ordinary retail investors. The number of applicants for these high-risk share sales has skyrocketed in recent years. The Securities and Exchange Board of India has issued a cautionary advisory regarding investments in securities of companies listed in the SME segment.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112986059,imgsize-53120,width-400,resizemode-4/112986059.jpg"

Mumbai-Indore train journey to get shorter! Cabinet approves new Manmad-Indore railway line,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/mumbai-indore-train-journey-gets-shorter-cabinet-approves-new-manmad-indore-railway-line-see-details/articleshow/112991977.cms,"Mumbai to Indore train travel gets a boost! Your Indian Railways train journey between Mumbai and Indore is set to get shorter with the Cabinet approving a new railway line project. Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs on Monday approved a new project that will ensure “shortest rail connectivity between Mumbai and Indore”.The new railway project will come up between Indore and Manmad at a total expenditure of Rs 18,036 crore.It will cover 6 districts in the two states of Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh. The project will increase the existing Indian Railways network by 309 kilometres and will involve the construction of 30 new railway stations as well.The new railway line project is expected to generate direct employment of around 102 lakh man-days during its construction.The project, a result of the PM-Gati Shakti National Master Plan for multi-modal connectivity, has been made possible through integrated planning and will ensure seamless connectivity for the movement of people, goods, and services.The new line will improve connectivity to the aspirational district of Barwani and providing access to around 1,000 villages and a population of about 30 lakh.According to the government’s press release, the project will boost tourism in the region by offering a shorter route between the western and south-western parts of the country and central India, increasing tourist footfall to various tourist and religious sites in the Ujjain-Indore region, including the Sri Mahakaleshwar Jyotirlinga Temple.Moreover, the project will directly connect the Pithampur Auto Cluster, which houses 90 large units and 700 small and medium industries, to the gateway port of JNPA and other state ports.It will also provide direct connectivity to millet-producing districts in Madhya Pradesh and onion-producing districts in Maharashtra, facilitating the distribution of these commodities to northern and southern parts of the country.The route is crucial for transporting various commodities, including agricultural products, fertilizer, containers, iron ore, steel, cement, and POL. The capacity augmentation work is expected to result in additional freight traffic of about 26 MTPA (Million Tonnes Per Annum).","The new railway project will come up between Indore and Manmad at a total expenditure of Rs 18,036 crore.

Source: ET quoting Paisabazaar for interest rates data as on August 14, 2024.

Highest Fixed Deposit Interest Rates: Fixed deposits (FDs) offered by banks are secure and interest-generating investment options. With FDs, you can expect a guaranteed return on your invested funds, which remain unaffected by market fluctuations. This is the reason that FDs are a go to investment option for most risk averse investors.Interest rates for fixed deposits are near all time highs, with RBI pausing the rate cycle for several monetary policy meetings now.Investors have the flexibility to choose between the re-investment deposit option, which allows for the accumulation of compound interest, or the option to receive interest payments at regular intervals (monthly/quarterly) to support their financial planning and budgeting needs, notes an ET report.The interest rates offered on fixed deposits in August 2024 can vary based on several factors, including the specific bank, the age of the depositor, the tenure of the deposit, and the amount invested.In India, private banks are financial institutions where private companies or individuals hold the majority of the equity, in contrast to public-sector banks where the government is the primary shareholder.Public Sector Undertaking (PSU) banks are ones where the government owns the majority of the shares. These banks receive government subsidies with the aim of facilitating their growth and expansion.For investors interested in comparing fixed deposit interest rates between private and public sector banks, a brief analysis of the fixed deposit rates offered to both general citizens and senior citizens is provided below.","Public Banks: Latest Fixed Deposit Interest Rates For General Citizens. Private Banks: Highest Fixed Deposit interest rates for General Citizens and Private Banks. PSU Bank Fixed Deposit Rates: Highest slab, lowest slab, 1-year, 3-year and 5-year tenure.

Banks lack skills to lend to emerging areas: SBI chief,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/banks-lack-skills-to-lend-to-emerging-areas-sbi-chief/articleshow/113008031.cms,"MUMBAI: SBI chairman C S Setty said that even after years of lending to infrastructure, banks lack expertise in advances to emerging areas like green energy and battery storage .He added that after excesses in corporate lending caused a surge in NPAs, banks have been compelled to go after personal loans because a lack of formalisation has made it difficult to lend to small businesses and retail.""While we expect much of the capital to come from overseas and support domestic capital formation, universal banks - particularly large ones like SBI - are expected to play a role in infrastructure financing. Despite our years of expertise in project financing, the skill set required to assess emerging areas is still lacking. One idea is to establish a center of excellence focused on these areas, in collaboration with multilateral development banks and large MNC banks. We are working on that,"" said Setty.","SBI chairman C S Setty said banks lack expertise in advances to emerging areas like green energy and battery storage.

Of those still running, none are on an A350 aircraft. Cathay has said some 48 individual flights, including return legs, have been canceled.The Hong Kong-based airline, among the world’s biggest operators of the long-haul A350, identified the component failure on a plane that was forced to return from a flight originally headed to Zurich on Monday.

Railway Budget 2024 : The government has wavered little in its efforts to spur a modernisation of railways in the country, pivoting on technology, to support the country’s economic ambitions. In line with expectations, Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore, marking yet another year of successive increase in outlay.That takes forward the past policies and the government’s vision, which have paved the way for modernisation of the transport behemoth.In earlier decades, the government had focused on laying tracks on new routes, electrification and incremental rolling stock capacity addition. That was the need of the hour back then and has helped set up the base for a larger transformation.For instance, the massive Dedicated Freight Corridor ( DFC ) as well as locomotive factories at Marhaura and Madhepura in Bihar were conceptualised over a decade ago and we are seeing their completion now.More recently, the focus has shifted to modernisation—of rolling stock and safety systems, among other aspects.This year, emphasis has also been laid on the railways’ crucial role in industrial development. Commodity-specific corridors have been planned in eastern India and impetus given to port connectivity. Vande Bharat and technology-led upgrades in rolling stock remain in focus. Safety has been prioritised through budgetary allocations for the anti-collision systemKavach . That said, there are other cogs in the wheel that demand attention from a long-term perspective.First, the target for the Operating Ratio, the crucial efficiency gauge, has been set at 98.22% for 2024-25, compared with 98.65% in 2023-24. This reflects an imminent need for operational transformation. An effective overhaul of the world’s fourth-largest rail network will take many years and thus we need to start focusing on improving efficiency and reducing costs now.DFC is almost entirely operational and will be complete over the next few months. To ensure the project achieves its twin goals of reducing logistics costs and enhancing freight efficiency, railways need to attract more cargo on the corridor. This will help increase the rail coefficient and make the railways’ approach more market-oriented, which will in turn aid future corridors.A revamp of railway stations is on track, with sufficient funds dedicated to this end. But even though new coaches and wagons are increasingly being added to meet footfalls, the stations and passenger trains themselves remain synonymous with chaos.Just as safety, comfort and convenience have been prioritised, there is a need for solutions to address the capacity and demand challenges. As a first step, the government could target development of new stations and setting up of new coach production units.As a leading freight mover, Indian Railways carried a record 1,588 MT cargo in fiscal 2024, up from 1,095 MT in fiscal 2015. It accounts for 26% of the cargo moved in the country—by no means an easy feat. The railways aims to take this volume to 3,000 MT by 2030, which would require a 11% CAGR against the around 4.2% witnessed over the last 10 years. As per a report by TERI and Shakti Foundation, from carrying about 62% of freight traffic in 1990-91, Indian Railways’ share has declined to ~27% in 2014-15. This has been due to the expanding road network, cost competitiveness over railways, and door-to-door service. Thus, commencing the cycle of increasing the rail share again is commendable.DFCs, a high-capacity track network, high-power locomotives and improvement in wagon designs have set the ball rolling for larger capacity, faster freight trains that deliver better efficiency.Yet, achieving exponential growth is a tall ask given the current dynamics. Possibly, similar challenges might apply to other goals the railways might have for 2047.To be fair, despite its scale and complexity, Indian Railways has been able to achieve diverse developments at commendable speed.But the track ahead is long and it is time to start discussing the reinvention of the institutional set-up.Indian Railways sees substantial private sector involvement in the form of vendors and contractors. Policymakers could start mulling extreme options such as parallel privately-owned and operated railway infrastructure, coupled with centralised planning and an evolved role for the railways. This will need a robust policy framework from the Government of India.The time is perhaps also ripe to bring user charge and asset monetisation-driven segments for passengers as well as cargo to the discussion table. Globally, the separation of infrastructure and operations in railways has delivered mixed results, for example in the United Kingdom. The model should be analysed and revisited to understand its potential relevance in the Indian context.The key would be to retrace our steps and align our long-term goals to identify not just incremental changes but also ways to explore bold and path-breaking alternatives that put Indian Railways on a smooth track and bring it up to speed.","Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore.

Budget 2024 capital gains tax changes: The Narendra Modi government is considering suggestions for tweaks in the new long term capital gains tax regime that was announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman in Union Budget 2024.The July 23 budget reduced the LTCG tax on property from 20% to 12.5%. The indexation benefit, which allowed taxpayers to adjust the acquisition cost for inflation before calculating capital gains and thus reduce their tax liability, is proposed to be eliminated for properties purchased on or after April 1, 2001.The government publishes the Cost Inflation Index (CII) annually for this calculation.India Inc is appealing to the government for a gradual shift to the long-term capital gains tax regime proposed in the FY25 budget, which aims to eliminate indexation benefits for property, gold, and other unlisted assets.According to an ET report by Deepshikha Sikarwar, the industry is suggesting alternatives such as a higher tax rate with indexation or a lower rate of 12.5% without indexation, as well as some form of grandfathering for ancestral properties.The finance ministry is currently reviewing these proposals and will discuss them with the Prime Minister's Office. The final decision will be made closer to the date when the Finance Bill reply is to be presented in Parliament, the reports said.Industry groups are expected to submit formal proposals to the finance ministry in the near future.

Budget 2024 for manufacturing sector : The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth. While the middle class has been offered tax relief, the government's primary focus remains on judicious spending to maximize economic impact. The budget's core themes are employment, skilling, MSME development, and support for the middle class.Largely focus has remained intact on spending money judiciously to ensure that each penny spent creates a ripple effect in the entire economic landscape.Although at first glance, manufacturing might appear to have taken a backseat, a deeper analysis reveals a multifaceted approach to bolstering the sector. Initiatives like employment-linked benefits and internship programs, while primarily aimed at job creation and skill development, indirectly benefit manufacturing companies by expanding the talent pool.Extensive focus on the MSME manufacturing units by way of extending term loan facility for purchase of machinery and equipment without collateral or third-party guarantee, would help companies in augmenting their capital base/ capacity and strengthen the very foundation of the manufacturing ecosystem in the country. Development of a new credit-assessment model by Public Sector Banks to assess MSME credit shall provide much needed regulatory relief to the units.With respect to the large manufacturing entities, while there is no direct fiscal/ tax incentive introduced in this budget, some support has been provided with an extensive focus on development of ‘industrial parks’ in nearly 100 cities under the ‘plug and play’ model. Reforms proposed with respect to land administration, planning and management, shall also ease out acquisition related difficulties often faced by entrepreneurs/ business houses in acquiring lands for manufacturing set-ups.Targeted Customs duty interventions like, rationalization of Customs duty provisions in Mobile phone manufacturing setups, extension of Customs duty exemption on import of capital goods for manufacturing of solar cells and panels, full Customs duty exemption on import of 25 critical minerals,, shall provide the required impetus for enhancing domestic manufacturing environment.Governments’ focus on formulating an Economic Policy Framework to set the scope for next-gen reforms in the country, has a target to improve the productivity of factors of production, namely, land, labour, capital, entrepreneurship and technology. This shall pave the way for enabling achievement of a target of 25% manufacturing sector contribution to the nation’s GDP over the course of next 7-10 years.While the overall outlook is positive, the extension of tax benefits under Section 115BAB for manufacturing entities and the absence of new PLI schemes are notable omissions.The country’s manufacturing base is expanding as is reflective from the continuously increasing tax collections and expanding Purchasing Manager’s Index. It would be pertinent to see how the ground realities evolve vis-à-vis the vision envisaged, in the upcoming Financial Year.","The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth.

Budget 2024: Armed with the vision to propel India to become a developed country by 2047, the Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business thereby providing the required stimulus to the manufacturing sector and enabling large scale job creation.On the Indirect tax front, the industry welcomes the much-needed announcement for a comprehensive review of the rate structure under Customs enabling ease in product classification and dispute reduction. The proposal of lowering of Customs duty on a plethora of raw materials and products including solar cells, critical minerals and bullion are encouraging measures. The rationale behind such reduction clearly indicates support towards domestic manufacturing, deepening value addition and supporting targets in reducing carbon footprint.Relevant amendments under the Customs law have been made to provide increased time limits for re-imports and re-exports to enhance competitiveness of the fledgling MRO sector. The government has extended significant duty reduction and exemption benefits to the healthcare and electronics sectors, continuing the impetus of incentives provided under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme.Since their introduction in March 2020, the PLI schemes have indeed supported in revitalizing the manufacturing sector and strengthening the necessary supply chains. The success achieved in the mobile manufacturing sector has now enabled the Government to reduce customs duties on mobile phones and components, signalling a mature environment. The Budget proposals aim at reproducing similar outcomes for semiconductor and pharmaceutical industry by increasing the budgetary allocation.Buoyed by the increasing revenue collection under GST signalling a shift towards a mature tax regime, this Budget has harmonized the timeframes for the issuance of demand notices and adjudication orders for cases involving fraud, suppression or otherwise. Significant amendments to the GST legislations have been introduced reflecting the recommendations proposed by the GST Council such as regularizing non-levy of GST due to general practice which may turn out to be a breather for certain impacted industries reeling under huge tax demands.The Insurance sector has been provided much relief through the GST council recommendations which have been cemented in the present budget thereby ending long standing disputes on their business practices.The Government's efforts to push forward with its reform agenda are evident as plans to incentivize states for their business reform actions plans and digitalization through the Jan Vishwas Bill 2.0 is proposed. Further, setting up of e-commerce export hubs is envisaged to facilitate easier access to international markets for domestic players.The recent implementation of Budget proposals allows the government to maintain momentum in its reform agenda. These policy measures implicitly reaffirm the significance of India Inc as a crucial element in the development of infrastructure. However, there are still some expectations required to be met to march towards a Viksit Bharat 2047.",The Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business.

Budget 2024 : Real estate, a significant contributor to employment generation, has received a fair bit of attention in Budget 2024-25. Recent years have seen the sector transform rapidly, driven by factors such as favourable government policies, Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, strong economic growth and changing consumer preferences.Added to that, the budgetary focus on job creation, skilling and employment-linked incentives, infrastructure, urban development, rural connectivity, digitalisation and land-related norms, all dovetail to promote growth of the sector.Launched in June 2015, the PMAY aims to provide affordable housing to all eligible beneficiaries. The budget unveiled PMAY Urban 2.0, under which the housing needs of 1 crore urban poor and middle class will be addressed with an investment of Rs 10 lakh crore.The central government’s additional Rs 2.2 lakh crore injection in the next 5 years to make housing more affordable has the potential to revitalise the affordable housing market.Such an approach can play an important role in realising the government's vision of Housing for All and push growth and development. Hence, the significant investment under PMAY Urban 2.0 is expected to alleviate urban housing deficits, spurring construction and economic growth.Steps to introduce technological reforms within the regulatory framework for land, such as digitalisation or GIS mapping of land records, will improve transparency.Rationalisation of stamp duty across states will also be critical to bring in uniformity and initiate land-related reforms such as urban planning, usage and building bylaws.These are steps in the right direction and will boost growth. Moreover, they will improve the ease of property transactions and strengthen municipal finances through increased property taxes. Rationalization of stamp duty with an emphasis on women homebuyers may boost home-buyer sentiment in major cities, too.The budget has also given ample attention to urban and rural development, with rental housing for industrial workers through the public private partnership model, interest subsidies for rental housing, and transit-oriented developments.The proposal to develop investment-ready plug-and-play industrial parks in 100 cities may attract industrial investment, leading to increased demand for industrial real estate and support the growth of ancillary services and residential developments in these regions.Initiatives for industrial parks and rental housing for industrial workers align with the country’s manufacturing goals and addresses worker accommodation needs.These steps are expected to promote industrial growth and stability in labour-intensive sectors, while also creating new opportunities for real estate developers specialising in rental and affordable housing.The changes in long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax, however, have evoked a mixed reaction. The government lowered the long-term capital gains tax from 20% to 12.5%, which is a welcome step. However, this came with the removal of the indexation benefit.The changes could encourage more liquidity in property transactions and potentially increase the effective tax burden depending on the property’s acquisition date.The launch of Phase IV of the PM Gram Sadak Yojana in 25,000 rural habitations will improve connectivity in rural areas, promoting rural development and making these regions more accessible for investment. The primary objective of PMGSY is to build robust, all-weather roads in rural habitations. This initiative focuses on enhancing connectivity and supporting economic development in rural areas.In essence, the budget is geared towards stimulating growth and investment in the real estate sector , fostering a more transparent and investor-friendly environment, and contributing to overall development. It aims to create a balanced and inclusive growth environment by addressing the needs of various segments, including affordable housing, industrial workers and urban infrastructure.The effectiveness of the initiatives, however, hinges on their implementation and continued support of complementary reforms.","Budget 2024-25 is geared towards stimulating growth and investment in the real estate sector.

New Budget 2024 rule: Why Income Tax Department is likely to issue a huge number of tax notices this month,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-budget-2024-rule-why-income-tax-department-is-likely-to-issue-a-huge-number-of-tax-notices-this-month/articleshow/112186079.cms,"Taxing Times

Income Tax Notice on the way? The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month, as there are concerns that many taxpayers might escape the tax net due to the impending implementation of the new reassessment law on September 1, 2024.According to the amended regulation announced in Budget 2024 , the tax authorities can only go back a maximum of five years to reassess a taxpayer's records if the escaped income is at least Rs 50 lakh, and three years for an amount less than Rs 50 lakh.Previously, they could reassess cases up to 10 years old.According to an ET report, tax officials are now faced with the challenge of compiling and corroborating data on tax and income mismatches for the financial years 2013-14 to 2017-18 within the next few weeks, as these years will become time-barred for reassessment from September 1, 2024.The I-T department relies on information from various sources, such as banks, property registrars, and search findings from the investigation wing, to build reassessment cases.A tax officers' body has raised concerns about the feasibility of issuing notices under Section 148 (or 148A) in a large number of cases within a single month, given the overburdened nature of the jurisdictional assessing officers and the time-consuming process of obtaining sanction from the chief commissioner, who is the specified authority for such notices.Moreover, the law provides taxpayers with the right to explain their position before reassessment orders are finalized, a process that most believe cannot be completed by the end of August.Also Read | ITR refund status for FY 2023-24: How to check income tax refund status online - here’s a step-by-step guide for incometax.gov.in & NSDL websites The Central Board of Direct Taxes ( CBDT ) has been urged by its officers to postpone the effective date of the proposed amendment. However, this suggestion is unlikely to be well-received by corporations and high net worth individuals.""Capping the reassessment period at five years was a great decision as it would reduce hassles and litigation. But if the department fears there could be a genuine loss of revenue as it may not be possible to wrap up several matters by August 31, the government can think of strict parameters where time-bound cases can be selectively reopened - based on trails of steps taken in identifying escaped income,"" said Mitil Chokshi, partner at CA firm Chokshi & Chokshi.""Taxpayers may expect a rush of reassessment notices in August 2024. These notices are likely to be for the AYs 2018-19 and prior to that. It is pertinent to note that the Bombay High Court in a recent ruling in a case of Hexaware Technologies has taken a view on a proviso introduced in 2021, which can be interpreted to mean that AY 2017-18 (and prior years) got time barred on March 31, 2024. These reassessment notices (for AYs 2017-18 and prior) are likely to rake up new interpretation issues in the already muddled reassessment provisions,"" said Ashish Mehta, partner at law firm Khaitan & Co.The current situation is similar to the conflict between the Income Tax office and taxpayers in 2021. The reassessment law was amended in April 2021, allowing the tax office to reopen 10-year-old tax returns if the total undisclosed income exceeded Rs 50 lakh and reassess 4-year-old matters if the amount was less than Rs 50 lakh.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? However, this change led to over 10,000 writ petitions being filed by companies, arguing that they were not given sufficient time to explain and that the notices were issued without considering the carve-out that cases which couldn't be reopened earlier couldn't be reassessed under the new law.The Supreme Court invoked its extraordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution on May 4, 2022, to uphold all reassessment notices issued after March 31, 2021. However, the court left room for judicial proceedings based on the merits of each case, and several such matters are currently pending before the court.","The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month.

Are NPS Vatsalya & hiked NPS deduction limit for private sector employees good moves from Budget 2024?

NPS and EPF: Overlapping services

What is NPS Vatsalaya?

Latest NPS rules, news: In the Union Budget 2024 speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced two new initiatives with regard to National Pension Scheme (NPS) - extension of NPS 14% employer contribution benefits to private setcor and the intended launch of NPS Vatsalya.Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries, bringing it at par with the provisions available for government employees.Sriram Iyer, CEO, HDFC Pension Management told ET that with this move the “ground rules have been harmonised among government and non-government employees, which is a positive step.”Effectively, this means that now, private-sector employees can choose to reduce the taxable portion of employers’ contribution to their NPS corpus, thereby paying less tax and leaving greater funds in their pension deposits.“Employees will benefit from tax savings . More importantly, the 40% increase in contribution will have a significant impact on the terminal value of the retirement corpus,” remarked Iyer. The extended savings will “help in retirement planning, working as an option that is at par with the Provident Fund,” Dinesh Rohira, CEO & Founder, 5nance.com was quoted as saying.Moreover, the endeavour aims to increase NPS penetration by increasing tax incentives for the private sector, providing them a social security-cushion post-retirement.The scheme’s motive to widen the NPS subscriber base may not prove to be flawlessly effective, however. This is explained by Agrees Mrin Agarwal, Founder, Finsafe India: “While it’s good that the limit has been raised, it may not increase adoption as employees need to be educated in a big way. Also, the benefit is only for the salaried opting for the new tax regime,” she says.The mandatory contribution to the EPF, too, threatens to relegate the provisions of NPS under the umbrella of near-superfluity. This sentiment is echoed by Varun Sahay, a software engineer in a Delhi-based IT company: “When 12% of my salary is already deducted for the EPF, why should I put in more in the NPS and cut my take-home pay?”Rohira feels otherwise. “There’s no competition between the NPS and EPF as employees can contribute to both and build a 3-4 times bigger corpus while earning 3-4% higher returns via marketlinked options in the NPS,” he counters.Also Check | New Tax Regime 2023 vs 2024 After Budget: How Much Income Tax Will Salaried Taxpayers Save & How Do New Tax Slabs Compare To Old Regime? Top 10 Points You Must Know To jumpstart retirement savings for children, a new initiative called NPS Vatsalya has been unveiled in the Budget. This scheme allows parents and guardians to contribute to a minor's account, which can be converted into a regular NPS account once the child reaches adulthood.""It provides a very long duration for reaping the compounding benefits and accumulating a huge bounty at a later age. This can be a good way to plan a better future for kids who may not opt for a service segment in the future,"" says Rohira. Sriram Iyer agrees, stating, ""It’s a good move to help the child start his retirement journey. Even if a parent starts when the child is 10 years old, by the time he starts working, it can be a solid foundation for the compounding journey after that.""However, some experts question the utility of a product with such a long lock-in period, especially when parents cannot use the funds for essential goals like their child’s education amidst soaring education costs of 11-12%.""Parents are struggling to save for their own retirement, so it might be a bit of a stretch to expect them to save for their kids’ retirement. The need of the hour is a market-linked product that allows withdrawals only for the child’s education,"" says Mrin Agarwal, Founder of Finsafe India.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? Though the NPS permits partial withdrawals, it allows only 25% of the corpus after three years of joining, and this can be done only three times during the entire tenure. A premature exit before 60 years with 100% withdrawal is only possible if the corpus is less than Rs.2.5 lakh, an amount insufficient for most children's goals.""In its current form, there won’t be any uptake,"" asserts Agarwal. Rohira concurs, ""It’s a vanilla product with a lock-in, which does not make it very attractive and it may not take off. However, the government may optimise it and introduce new features later."" Iyer adds, ""This is just a start and there may be more subscriber-friendly features as we take it to the market. The regulator is proactive and open to feedback.""","Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries.

Gold import duty cut: Why Indians may not find buying gold from Dubai as attractive post Budget 2024,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-import-duty-cut-why-indians-may-not-find-buying-gold-from-dubai-as-attractive-post-budget-2024/articleshow/112097671.cms,"Gold import duty cut in Budget 2024: The recent reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai. Indian jewellers with stores in both India and the UAE believe that the narrowed duty differential will result in lower gold prices in India, making it less attractive for Indians to purchase gold in Dubai.The emirate had attracted gold-enthusiast Indians following a steep rise in customs duty in India in July 2022. In the fiscal 2024-25 budget, the duty on gold imports was more than halved.The duty cut is also expected to boost gold jewellery production in India, particularly the popular 'Kolkatti' jewellery from Kolkata, which is favored by Indian expats in Dubai and tourists from various countries. This move will encourage gold artisans to create new designs in both heavyweight and lightweight jewellery, attracting consumers to purchase gold from India.According to an ET report, Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group , estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India as Indian tourists who previously bought jewellery in Dubai will now prefer to shop in India. However, Indian expats living in Dubai and other customers may continue to buy from the UAE.Also Read | Gold losing sheen?

He points out that the labour cost is significantly lower in India, and with the introduction of mandatory hallmarking and HUID numbers, the purity of gold in India is no longer a concern.Furthermore, NRIs in Dubai do not receive VAT refunds, and Indians travelling abroad only receive about 60% of the VAT back on their gold purchases. Gold trade analyst Bhargav Baidya suggests that the 1% duty differential between gold jewellery in India and Dubai will be offset by Indian jewellers offering discounts to retain and attract customers.Saurabh Gadgil, chairman of PNG Jewellers, notes that Indian import duty is now on par with the US, allowing Indian jewellers to offer competitive prices compared to other countries worldwide. The reduced customs duty is expected to make gold purchases in India more attractive and convenient for Indian consumers, potentially leading to a significant shift in their gold shopping preferences.",The reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai.

Gold losing sheen? The government has reduced its target for issuing gold bonds in the financial year 2024-25 by 38% compared to the previous interim budget goal, according to a senior official. The revised target stands at Rs 18,500 crore, down from Rs 29,638 crore estimated in the interim budget and Rs 26,852 crore (revised estimate) in 2023-24.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told ET ""The decision followed a reassessment of various factors, including investor demand, other investment products and uncertainties around the global economy, as the situation has changed since the interim budget in February.""After accounting for redemptions, the net issuances of sovereign gold bonds are now estimated at Rs 15,000 crore for this fiscal year, a significant decrease from the Rs 26,138 crore projected in the interim budget and Rs 25,352 crore in the revised estimate for 2023-24.Harish Galipelli, director at ILA Commodities India, attributed this shift to retail investors increasingly opting for equities in anticipation of better returns. He also noted that people are uncertain about the potential for further increases in gold prices in the short-to-medium term following a recent rally. Additionally, Galipelli pointed out that savings in rural areas have been impacted by retail inflation and other factors.The gold bond and gold monetisation schemes were introduced by the government in late 2015 to discourage the physical purchase of precious metals and reduce imports, thereby mitigating the negative impact on the current account deficit.The gross collection through these two schemes is now projected to be Rs 20,030 crore in 2024-25, compared to Rs 31,168 crore in the interim budget and Rs 28,240 crore (revised estimate) in the previous fiscal year. Similarly, the net collection is estimated at Rs 16,433 crore, down from Rs 27,571 crore in the interim budget and Rs 26,653 crore in the previous year.

Both schemes were designed to curb gold imports, which, along with crude oil, have been significant contributors to India's current account deficit.

Speaking at the CII Financing Summit , Das said, ""First, we are seeking the government's approval for allowing natural dilution of their stake down by up to 10 per cent.The government will take a final call on that.""During a panel discussion he said that the Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency (IREDA) had also submitted a draft Green Taxonomy to the Ministry of New & Renewable Energy ( MNRE ) one and a half years back and it is at an quite advanced stage.He stated that the entity is confident because of the kind of equity it requires and what the sector expects from it. He said, ""We have initially estimated Rs 4,500 crore by January-February in order to ensure that we have a fair amount of loan book as well as capital adequacy ratio which is very important.""According to PTI, Das also expects the agency to be included in the list of companies that can raise funds through bonds covered under 54EC of the Income Tax Act and that whether the quantum of funds to be raised from this instrument had not been decided.The previous week, S&P Global Ratings Limited assigned long term rating 'BBB-', short term rating 'A-3' with outlook as 'Stable', to IREDA which would allow expansion in the international market, tapping into attractive sources of funding and supporting its borrowing plan.Emphasizing on the sustenance of these ratings, Das said, ""As important it is to get the rating, it is even more important to sustain the rating. So we're going about it very responsibly.""""All development finance institutions and multilateral organizations have been associated with us since 1997 but we haven't borrowed from them because the landed cost is high,"" he added.As per Das, currently, the company's capital adequacy ratio is around 20 per cent and needs to ensure this ratio at 17-18 per cent to have a healthy, stable 'AAA' rating in the time to come. He said that this process was in its advanced stages and it is possible to achieve within the coming weeks.""As announced by the Finance Minister in her budget speech, Climate Taxonomy is poised to increase the availability of capital for climate adaptation and mitigation projects.

It had also showed that the top 1% of the active traders who made profit were able to corner 51% of the market's total profit.The study showed that non-institutional investors (NIIs), popularly called the high networth individuals or HNIs, were more aggressive in booking profit in the short term than the absolute retail investors.

The doctor realised she was on a tourist visa and not a medical visa, which takes longer to process. As a result, the hospital could not treat her.Triza Catherine Michael from Tanzania, who is in Chennai for treatment (she didn’t want to share details about the illness), says she came to know about the medical facilities in Chennai after searching online.“Here doctors and the public are hospitable. But it would help if visa processing is made simpler,” she says.Jeanine Louisiane Hariba from Seychelles says people choose hospitals in Chennai and other cities in Tamil Nadu because of the expertise of medical professionals and the facilities available. “The hospital welcomed me from the airport and provided a translator too. The care I received showcases how medical tourism in India offers top-quality care. It truly felt like a home away from home,” she adds.Such experiences will be enhanced now as Tamil Nadu Tourism has decided to set up a team to coordinate with hospitals, wellness centres, and clinics, and streamline processes for people coming for treatment to the state. The aim is to promote the state as a global healthcare destination.“In Chennai, waiting time to meet specialists is very little. In Sri Lanka, it is a minimum of three weeks and in the US and UK it takes months. Allied health care such as physiotherapy is good in TN,” says Dr Prasad E, senior consultant, medical oncology, Apollo Proton Cancer Centre.Currently, about 1.5 million tourists visit Tamil Nadu annually for various types of treatment, including transplant surgeries, minimally invasive and endovascular surgeries, coronary bypass/angioplasty, heart valve replacement, gastric sleeve/bypass, and cornea/retinal surgeries. Most of them are from Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Africa.However, the process of seeking medical care in Tamil Nadu is largely unregulated. “Patients often rely on websites offering medical tour packages, but they sometimes get cheated after being directed to places that are not under the National Accreditation Board for Hospitals and Healthcare Providers (NABH),” says Dr Raju Sivasamy, vice-president of SIMS Hospital.The newly formed vertical under the tourism department plans to address these issues by forming a committee that will tackle concerns related to visas, money transfers, accommodation, post-medical care, and even food. “We often don’t know the difficulties families face. These can range from visa extension issues and money transfer problems to finding suitable post-surgery accommodation,” says an official from the tourism department. “We have met with hotels and hospitals to understand how they can assist in this initiative.”Dr Raju Sivasamy suggests the tourism department launch a website to guide medical tourists. “The site could list NABH-accredited hospitals by specialty. After surgery, patients need to stay for about two weeks for monitoring. The govt could coordinate with the hotel industry to facilitate their stay, and hotels could be upgraded to offer wellness treatments too,” he adds.“We should start focusing on wellness. We have a good talent pool from allied health sciences. A speciality-oriented boost is needed,” says Dr Prasad. “The govt can list out accredited hospitals based on their speciality and schemes available for medical tourists. An algorithm-based workflow has to be introduced to help make the entire medical visa process, hospital admission, post treatment stay easier,” he adds.G S K Velu, Chairman of FICCI Tamil Nadu, stresses the need for improved connectivity and clearance processes, not only for foreign patients but also for pathology samples. “If these issues are resolved, TN could also become a global destination for cutting-edge diagnostics. It recently lost ground to Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Mumbai, and Delhi, particularly due to flight connectivity issues from the Middle East and African countries. Govt coordination is crucial to addressing this,” he adds.","Tamil Nadu Tourism has decided to set up a team to coordinate with hospitals, wellness centres, and clinics.

NEW DELHI: ICICI Bank has issued a strong denial in response to recent allegations from the Congress party on Monday, which accused SEBI Chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch of receiving regular income from the bank and ICICI Prudential, while serving as a whole-time member and later Chairperson of the capital markets regulator. The allegations suggest a conflict of interest and a violation of office for profit norms.Pawan Khera , chairman of the Media and Publicity Department for the Congress in a press conference held on Monday, alleged that Buch received a total of Rs 16.80 crore between 2017 and 2024 from ICICI Bank, ICICI Prudential, ESOPs , and TDS on ESOPs.

Khera further claimed that Buch had relaxed regulatory norms for ICICI Bank during her tenure at SEBI, citing unnamed reports.Khera said, ""The person sitting at the top of the regulator is taking salaries from another entity,"" labeling it a clear case of ""office for profit.""In response, ICICI Bank reiterated its earlier statement denying any post-retirement salary or ESOP grants to Buch after she opted for superannuation on October 31, 2013. The bank stated, ""ICICI Bank or its group companies have not paid any salary or granted any ESOPs to Madhabi Puri Buch after her retirement, other than her retiral benefits."" The bank clarified that any payments made to Buch post-retirement were related to ESOPs and retiral benefits accrued during her employment.ICICI Bank explained that under its ESOP rules, employees, including retired employees, could exercise their ESOPs up to 10 years from the date of vesting, and any income derived from these ESOPs was treated as perquisite income under Income Tax rules.Previously, Buch and her husband were also accused by Hindenburg Research of having stakes in offshore funds linked to the Adani Group, allegations both have denied as baseless.Buch has maintained that her finances are transparent, and the Adani Group has similarly dismissed the allegations, asserting that it has no commercial relationship with Buch or her husband.",ICICI Bank has issued a strong denial in response to recent allegations from the Congress party.

How to choose the right online psychic

Green flags

Transparency. A good psychic will be upfront about their methods and experience and the cost associated with the reading. They won't make outlandish claims or promises.

Empathy. Any real psychic will listen to you and be empathetic and understanding. They should make you feel comfortable and respect your boundaries during a session.

Positive reviews. Positive reviews are an indication that a psychic made a positive impact on previous clients. It’s also an opportunity to learn more about their specific methods.

Red flags

Guaranteed results. No psychic can guarantee an exact outcome. Be cautious of any who do promise something very particular, be that success or failure. Where your life takes you is not something any psychic can control, however accurate readings you may receive.

Pushing for more sessions. Anyone pushing you to book more sessions or purchase more services is likely someone who doesn’t have the top intentions. Be careful about how you spend your money.

Lack of transparency. While there may be price variation for psychic readings, it is a red flag if a price is extraordinarily high with no explanation given as to why. There needs to be transparency in pricing.

The new target is set to replace wealthy nations' current commitment to provide 100 billion dollars every year in climate finance to developing countries.A far larger goal than 100 billion dollars is needed by the vulnerable and developing countries. Donor countries such as the 27 nation EU and Canada state that stretching national budgets would make it unrealistic to increase their public funding.The COP29 summit will be held in Azerbaijan in November.One option in the document reflects the stance of Arab countries, aiming for the developed countries to provide 441 billion Dollars each year in grants, combined to accumulate a total 1.1 trillion dollars in funding from all sources, including private finance, each year from 2025 to 2029.Another option reflects the EU's negotiating perspective by setting a global climate funding target of more than 1 trillion Dollars each year, including countries' domestic investments and private funding, which would also include a lesser amount provided by countries ""with high greenhouse gas emissions and economic capabilities"".The EU has demanded that China, which is the world's biggest polluter and biggest economy today, should contribute to the new climate funding goal.Under a system that was developed in the 1990s, China is categorized as a developing country by the UN. However, the idea that it should be on the hook to pay climate finance is rejected by Beijing.Negotiators expect that the issue of who should contribute is becoming one of the biggest hurdles to agreeing a finance deal at COP29.Another option in the document, supporting Canada's position, suggests to change the list of the contributors to the target. It says that the list should be based on their per-capita emissions and income, a measure that could also add the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and others to the contributor list.",UN climate body published a negotiations document to set out the splits between nations.

China's house prices to drop sharply by 8.5% in 2024,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/chinas-house-prices-to-drop-sharply-by-8-5-in-2024/articleshow/112928274.cms,"NEW DELHI: Housing costs in China are expected to fall at a faster pace this and the following year than previously forecasted, as support policies from Beijing struggle to help the property prevent further decline, as per a Reuters poll.The poll showed that the prices would fall by 8.5 per cent in 2024, versus a 5.0 per cent decline tipped in a previous survey in May.Prices are likely to tumble by 3.9 per cent in 2025 from a constant figure forecast in May.Ma Hong, a senior analyst at GDDCE Research Institution said, ""The actual source of funding for property developers has shrunk more seriously, affecting the release of housing demand .""Ma said, “My house price forecasts have been revised down from May, as cash flow pressures on some big real estate companies will continue to mount, widening risk exposure and putting pressure on confidence in the property market .”A prolonged property crisis since 2021 has led the inventories of unsold apartments to swell, hampering developers' cash flows and weighing heavily on home prices, consumer confidence and economic activity .Chinese policymakers have made continuous efforts to revive the sector, which at its peak accounted for one fourth of the economy, including reducing mortgage rates and lowering home buying costs.The poll of 10 analysts from August 26 to August 29 showed that property sales have shrunk by 16 per cent in 2024, much steeper than the 10 per cent slump forecast in the previous poll, while the investment was expected to fall by 10.3 per cent from the 10 per cent decline forecast in May.Wang Xingping, a senior analyst at Fitch Bohua said, ""The uncertainty of economic environment also adversely impacts on homebuying decisions. Despite the continuous rollout of supportive policies, they are not strong enough to reverse the downward trend.""In July, the Chinese leaders had pledged to continue supporting the delivery of unfinished projects and turn unsold apartments into affordable housing, help stabilize the sector.Beijing's plan to resolve its property problems is having a steady start. Central bank data shows that only 4 per cent of the 300 billion yuan ( USD 42.30 billion) relending scheme to help support the crisis has been drawn by local governments and state firms.UBS Investment Bank this week reduced its 2024 and 2025 forecasts for China's GDP growth from 4.9 per cent to 4.6 per cent and from 4.6 per cent to 4 due to a lower-than-expected property downturn.The bank expects more supportive policies for the remaining 2024, including faster fiscal spending, more government bond issuance, an expansion in equipment and durable goods upgrade and trade-in, and a little more monetary easing.","The poll showed that the prices would fall by 8.5 per cent in 2024, versus a 5.0 per cent decline tipped in a previous survey in May.

Japan's defense ministry seeks record budget as it faces growing threat from China,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/japans-defense-ministry-seeks-record-budget-as-it-faces-growing-threat-from-china/articleshow/112924861.cms,"TOKYO: Japan 's Defense Ministry Friday sought a record 8.5 trillion yen ( Dollar 59 billion) budget for the next year to fortify its deterrence on southwestern islands against China's increasing threat, while focusing on unmanned weapons and AI to make up for the declining number of servicemembers as a result of the country's shrinking population.The ministry's request for 2025 marks the third year of Japan's rapid five-year military buildup plan under the government's ongoing security strategy.Japan aims to spend 43 trillion yen ( Dollar 297 billion) through 2027 to double its annual military spending to around 10 trillion yen, making it the world's third-largest military spender after the United States and China.The budget request was approved at the Defense Ministry meeting Friday ahead of a submission to the Finance Ministry for negotiations through December.Japan has been rapidly building up the defense of the southwestern region in recent years amid China's growing military threats and tension in the regional seas.China has escalated clashes with the Philippine coast guards in disputed waters in the South China Sea and sent a fleet of coast guard boats to routinely violate territorial waters around Japanese-controlled disputed islands in the East China Sea that Beijing also claims.A hefty 970 billion yen ( Dollar 6.7 billion) of the budget request for 2025 covers the cost of bolstering strike-back capability with the development and purchases of long-range missiles and equipment for their launch, including from an Aegis-class destroyer. About one-third of it goes to a satellite constellation aimed at bolstering the capability to detect missile-related activity, as North Korea, China and Russia develop hypersonic missiles that are harder to detect and track.While pushing military buildup, Japan must deal with a shrinking troop size and is focusing on developing and buying more drones for surveillance and combat, requesting 103 billion yen ( Dollar 710 million). It also seeks 314 billion yen ( Dollar 2.17 billion) to build three new multi-purpose compact destroyers that require 90 crewmembers, less than half the crew size currently needed.Japanese defense officials say combat drones are ""game changers"" that can be on hours-long missions and lower human losses in combat and consider it a main pillar of Japan's ongoing military buildup. The unmanned weapons can also help a country struggling with its aging and shrinking population.Japan has been struggling to fulfill SDF troop levels at 247,000 people.The Self-Defense Force has faced difficulty attracting young applicants in recent years and fulfilled only half of its recruiting target of 19,598 last year, making it the lowest in the 70 years of SDF history. Last year, 6,258 mid-career personnel left, the highest number in 30 years.""Due to declining childbirths and working age population, it is inevitable that Japan will face a society of serious labor shortage,"" the ministry said in an interim report on human resources, also released Friday. ""We need to build an organization that can fight in new ways while strengthening defense power.""Shrinking younger population and private companies that offer better salaries and benefits make ""the environment surrounding recruiting servicemembers the worst since the end of World War II,"" the ministry report said.It requested 18 billion yen ( Dollar 124 million) to introduce an AI surveillance system at 40 SDF bases across Japan, aiming to free up 1,000 service personnel. It is also asking 4.3 billion ( Dollar 29.7 million) for automated supply storage for launch in 2027 in Okinawa.In the interim report released Friday, the ministry called for reforms to improve salary, working environment, more training and learning opportunities, as well as support for working mothers to lure more women.The ministry has been hit by a series of revelations of sexual assaults, harassment and abuse of power in recent years. Its internal investigation last year criticized cover-up attempts and a lack of sense of responsibility among supervisors. It came under fire in July over the leak of classified information and corruption scandals.",Japan's Defense Ministry seeks record 8.5 trillion yen ( Dollar 59 billion) budget for the next year.

This data does not include foreign domestic helpers, highlighting a broader trend of economic pressure on local residents.A study released by the UK-based consultancy WTW revealed that nearly 40 percent of Hong Kong companies have reduced their payroll budgets for the financial year ending in March, a substantial increase from the 21 percent reported a year earlier. This reduction is indicative of widespread financial caution among businesses in the region, reported SCMP.Additionally, a survey conducted in May by the Hong Kong Small and Medium Enterprises Association and Junior Chamber International Hong Kong found that 70 percent of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) reported business levels falling below pre-pandemic norms.This underscores the ongoing difficulties faced by the SME sector, which has struggled to recover fully from the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.The official statistics also showed that while the labour force grew by 8,900 to 3,474,400, unemployment surged to 114,700 in the second quarter, an increase of 3,000 from the previous quarter. The construction, retail, accommodation, and food services sectors were hit hardest, with unemployment rates in these sectors significantly surpassing the overall average rate of 3 percent.Furthermore, the number of underemployed residents increased by 4,500, reaching 44,500 during the same period. Underemployment, where individuals are working fewer hours than desired, reflects the broader issue of economic instability, as reported by SCMP.The city has seen a wave of closures across various sectors, including shops, restaurants, and cinemas, contributing to the economic downturn. In response to these challenges, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority recently established a task force to support small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) struggling with loan repayments.Chief Executive John Lee Ka-Chiu acknowledged the economic difficulties but expressed a positive outlook, stating that the transition of old businesses being replaced by new ones is a normal economic process. He projected that the economy could see improvements in the coming year.The economic challenges in Hong Kong reflect a complex interplay of local and global factors, including the ongoing effects of the pandemic and broader economic uncertainties.",Hong Kong's economic situation has seen a notable downturn in the second quarter of this year.
