"Stock market today: BSE Sensex ends over 1,300 points up; Nifty50 above 24,500",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/stock-market-today-bse-sensex-nifty50-august-16-2024-dalal-street-indian-equities-global-markets/articleshow/112556245.cms,"Why BSE Sensex, Nifty50 are rallying today

Stock market today : BSE Sensex and Nifty50, the Indian equity benchmark indices rallied strongly in trade on Monday. While BSE Sensex reclaimed the 80,000 mark, Nifty50 too went above 24,500. BSE Sensex ended the day at 80,436.84, up 1,331 points or 1.68%. Nifty50 closed the day at 24,541.15, up 397 points or 1.65%. The top BSE Sensex gainers were Tech Mahindra, M&M, Tata Motors, TCS, Ultratech Cement, HCL Tech and ICICI Bank.The Indian stock market opened higher on Friday, following positive cues from global peers, as U.S. economic data alleviated recession fears in the world's largest economy.Several factors contributed to the rally, including cooling U.S. inflation, positive sentiment from U.S. markets, a decline in the dollar index, investors capitalizing on recent declines, Q1 results in line with expectations, and buying in IT stocks. The latest U.S. consumer price data, released earlier on Wednesday, showed that consumer prices rose moderately in July, with the annual inflation rate slowing to below 3% for the first time since early 2021.Wall Street's main indices closed higher on Thursday, with the Nasdaq rising more than 2% after July U.S. retail sales data signaled resilient consumer spending. The dollar index declined below the 103 level, making emerging market assets more attractive to foreign investors. Investors also took advantage of recent declines in the Nifty and Sensex, which fell over 2.5% in August.The just-concluded Q1 earning season was in line with street expectations, with net income for Nifty growing by 5.2%. According to Kotak Institutional Equities, ""The positive surprises came from BPCL, COAL and ONGC. The Q1FY25 EBITDA of the Nifty-50 Index grew 3.2% versus our expectation of 0.6% growth. However, earnings are less relevant in the current sentiment-laden market, with the market rewarding modest beats in certain cases (IT service, as an example) and ignoring large misses (APNT and JSTL being two prominent cases) in 1QFY25.""Indian IT stocks also surged, with the Nifty IT Index rising 1.7%, led by gains in Mphasis, LTTS, Wipro, and TCS. The positive sentiment in the U.S. market, driven by favorable economic data, benefited Indian IT companies, which derive a significant portion of their revenue from the U.S.","BSE Sensex reclaims 80,000 mark, Nifty50 too goes above 24,500.

Fastest manufacturing growth in 50 years? Apple’s India business surpasses Rs 2 lakh crore; tech giant India’s largest global value chain,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/fastest-manufacturing-growth-in-50-years-apples-india-business-surpasses-rs-2-lakh-crore-tech-giant-indias-largest-global-value-chain/articleshow/112513335.cms,"Apple's Growing Harvest

Apple’s India business grows in leaps! In FY24, Apple 's India operations witnessed a remarkable surge, reaching a value of over Rs 2 lakh crore ($23.5 billion), a significant increase from Rs 1.15 lakh crore in the previous year. A significant increase in iPhone production, along with strong domestic sales of MacBooks, iMacs, iPads, Watches, and AirPods, has boosted the value of Apple's operations in India.Top officials told ET that Apple's growth in production and exports in India over the last 50 years is likely the fastest and unparalleled by any other company, establishing the tech giant as the largest global value chain (GVC) operating within the country. Moreover, Apple is the first GVC in India to rapidly shift a portion of its supply chain away from China.The acceleration in Apple's operations in India can be attributed to the government's introduction of the smartphone production-linked incentive ( PLI ) scheme in 2020.In 2021, Apple began manufacturing iPhones in India, marking the first time the company produced iPhones outside of China. Since then, iPhone production in India has steadily increased through its three contract manufacturers – Foxconn, Wistron, and Pegatron – reaching Rs 1.20 lakh crore in FY24. The government provides incentives based on the freight on board (FOB) value at which the devices leave the factory, with market value or retail prices being 50-60% higher.The Economic Survey highlights India's contribution to Apple's overall production, which has risen to approximately 14%, positioning the country as a crucial hub for the company's global exports. In FY23, India's share was around 7%. iPhones constitute the majority of these figures, with exported iPhones valued at around Rs 1.35 lakh crore ($15 billion) in the last fiscal year, based on official data calculations.Domestic sales of Apple products in India reached approximately Rs 68,000 crore ($8 billion) in FY24. In FY23, Apple exported iPhones with a market value of Rs 66,000 crore. The company's market share in India, although steadily increasing from 2% in FY18, remains below 6% due to the dominance of the Android ecosystem, led by Chinese brands such as Vivo and Xiaomi. Additionally, India's revenue contribution to Apple's global revenue of $383 billion in FY23 was less than 2%.Also Read | Apple ecosystem becomes biggest blue-collar job creator in India! 1.5 lakh direct jobs created since PLI scheme India revenue figures of Apple do not include export numbers, but the increase in manufacturing by the Apple ecosystem has generated more than 150,000 direct jobs since 2021. The company's largest factory in India, operated by Foxconn, employs 41,000 individuals.During the third-quarter earnings call in August, Apple CEO Tim Cook announced that the company had achieved ""quarterly revenue records in more than two dozen countries and regions, including Canada, Mexico, France, Germany, the UK, India, Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand.""Despite Apple's success, smartphone shipments in India experienced a 2% year-on-year decline in the June quarter, according to Counterpoint Research. The market tracker attributed this decline to factors such as the heatwave, a seasonal slump, and a sequential slowdown in demand compared to the previous quarter.Recognizing the significance of India in the current geopolitical landscape, Cook visited the country in April last year to meet with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and inaugurate the first two company-owned retail stores in Delhi and Mumbai.During the earnings call in May, Cook emphasized the company's comprehensive approach to India, stating, ""the company was working on everything — from developers to markets and operations — in India. I see it as an incredibly exciting market and as a major focus for us.""","In FY24, Apple's India operations witnessed a remarkable surge, reaching a value of over Rs 2 lakh crore ($23.5 billion) A significant increase in iPhone production, along with strong domestic sales of MacBooks, iMacs, iPads, Watches, and AirPods, has boosted the value of Apple's operations in India.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112514332,imgsize-127566,width-400,resizemode-4/112514332.jpg"

Check List Nomination is a crucial aspect of opening lockers and savings accounts in India. The Indian Banks' Association (IBA) says, ""Banking Companies (Nomination) Rules 1985 permits banks to pay dues to nominees in the event of death of depositor(s) without asking for succession certificate or verifying claims of legal heirs. This simplifies settlement. Of course, as Trustee the nominee is accountable to legal heirs.The IBA further clarifies that the nomination facility is available for bank deposits, safe deposit lockers, and safe custody articles. A single deposit account, whether held individually or jointly, can have only one nominee. However, a jointly held locker can have two nominees. In the case of a minor's account, a person legally empowered to operate the account can file a nomination on behalf of the minor.The State Bank of India emphasizes the importance of availing the benefits of nomination facility and survivorship clause for locker-hirers. In the unfortunate event of the death of one of the joint locker-hirers, the contents of the locker do not automatically transfer to the surviving joint locker-hirer or nominee(s) unless there is a survivorship clause or nomination in place.When renting a locker, the bank charges a nominal annual rent based on the size of the locker and the location of the branch. The rent should be paid in advance for the financial year. The bank provides a copy of the signed Locker Agreement to the locker-hirer, outlining their rights and responsibilities.","The Banking Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2024 proposes to increase the number of nominees allowed per bank account and locker from one to four.

Car discounts galore! Car manufacturers and dealers are offering substantial discounts, including cash discounts, exchange bonuses, and additional benefits, even on popular models, in an effort to clear a significant inventory buildup caused by slowing sales.According to trade insiders, major automakers like Maruti Suzuki , Hyundai , Tata Motors , Skoda , and Honda are all providing cash discounts, exchange bonuses, and extra benefits on their popular models.Maruti Suzuki's average discount per vehicle increased by 50% to Rs 21,700 in the first quarter ended June, compared to Rs 14,500 in the last quarter of FY24, according to an ET report.Industry executives and dealers have reported that these discounts are among the highest seen in the local market since FY20, when promotional offers were rolled out to liquidate inventory before the transition to Bharat Stage VI emission standards.The industry started the fiscal year with normal stocks of around 300,000 vehicles, sufficient to meet demand for 30 days. However, sluggish sales led to an additional 100,000 units, prompting car makers and dealers to offer promotional schemes over the last four months, with benefits this month matching those in FY20. ""The discount levels now are among the highest I have ever seen in the market,"" an industry executive said on condition of anonymity.Passenger vehicle sales in the country reached a record high of 4.23 million last fiscal, partly due to pent-up demand after a global semiconductor crisis limited production for several months.However, sales have slowed down in the new fiscal year after three years of robust growth. A senior industry executive attributed the increased discounts to fewer launches this year compared to last year, when multiple SUVs were lined up ahead of the festive season and received a good response.Automakers and dealers are relying on the upcoming festive season, starting with Onam in Kerala next month, to boost market momentum. ""Kerala will be a harbinger of what we can expect during the festive season this year,"" said the senior industry executive.""If sales take off and inventory gets liquidated, wholesales will move. Or else, dealers may be hesitant to take more stocks. So far, vehicle sales in Kerala have been faring well due to inflow of remittances and better natural rubber prices.""","Maruti Suzuki's average discount per vehicle increased by 50% to Rs 21,700 in the first quarter ended June, compared to Rs 14,500 in the last quarter of FY24. Industry executives and dealers have reported that these discounts are among the highest seen in the local market since FY20.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112559581,imgsize-45260,width-400,resizemode-4/112559581.jpg"

Adani group stocks that were under pressure since Hindenburg Research's Aug 10 report too rallied.The sensex opened the day's session on a strong note, up more than 600 points, witnessed some selling pressure at higher levels and then reversed the trend to rally smartly to close at 80,437 points, up 1.7% on the day.On the NSE, Nifty too followed a similar trend and closed 397 points or 1.7% at 24,541 points.The local market had to catch up with gains in the US market and hence the day's rally, market players said. The main reason for the rally in the US market was the retail inflation data that showed a downward path last month to below 3% level which raised the chances of a cut in interest rates by its central bank in the world's largest economy next month. The stability of the Japanese yen and a few other global factors also aided the rally. The day's strong gains also more than made up for the aggregate losses of the previous three sessions.According to Vinod Nair of Geojit Financial Services, the stability of the yen has been instrumental in driving a global market recovery. ""Besides that, strong US retail sales and a decline in weekly jobless claims have helped alleviate fears of a US recession. Further, the market sentiment has improved due to a decrease in US (retail) inflation.""Some of the domestic factors also helped the rally while there are some weak signals too. ""Domestically, Indian retail inflation rate has fallen below the estimate, signalling optimism. However, challenges such as a drop in wholesale inflation, weak IIP (Index of Industrial Production), and lukewarm (first quarter) corporate earnings suggest that market gains may be limited, which is reflected by foreign funds maintaining a net seller position,"" Nair said in a note.In Friday's session, domestic funds, who have mostly been buying stocks in a falling market, were net buyers at Rs 2,606 crore. Interestingly, foreign funds too were net buyers on Friday, at Rs 767 crore, BSE data showed. The day's rally also added about Rs 7.2 lakh crore to investors' wealth with BSE's market capitalisation now at Rs 464 lakh crore.Among the 11 Adani group stocks, Adani Power was up 3.5%, Adani Wilmar 3.1% and flagship Adani Enterprises was up 2.3%.Outside of the blue-chips and large companies, recently listed Ola Electric Mobility, which announced a slew of new plans on Thursday, rallied the maximum possible 20% during the day's session to close at Rs 133 on BSE. The company now has a market capitalisation of Rs 58,558 crore, an all-time high level.","Across-the-board buying lifted the sensex by 1,331 points to close above the 80k mark on Friday.

Once they were considered back offices catering to Fortune 500 companies. But that was then. Global Capability Centres (GCCs) have since emerged from the shadows, expanding their sphere of influence within the Indian tech landscape. They have evolved into tech powerhouses, seamlessly integrating with their parent enterprises and becoming strategic assets providing access to digital talent at scale.This has reshaped the perception of GCCs within the Indian tech industry. From peripheral centres, GCCs have emerged as global hubs of strategic operations.Nearly 40 years after India's GCC poster boy, Texas Instruments, made Bengaluru its home for R&D operations, Indian GCCs have created a compelling story for global companies to acknowledge India's enviable tech talent pool. This has, a) created more tech jobs in India; and b) solidified India's position as a hub for advanced technological development.Just consider these numbers: India now has about 1,600 GCCs. This is estimated to go up to 1,900 by next year. According to a Nasscom-KPMG report, their combined market size now is $60 billion. In 2014-15, it was $19.6 billion, which more than doubled to $46 billion in 2022-23, a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.4%. GCCs added over 6 lakh new jobs between 2018-19 and 2023-24, taking the total job count to over 16 lakh or 1.6 million.If this sounds good, here's some better news for the sector. The latest Economic Survey was upbeat about the future of GCCs. By 2030, the Survey projects, GCCs will contribute a total revenue of $121 billion - roughly 3.5% of India's current GDP. Of this, $102 billion will come from exports.Take JPMorganChase , for instance. Its headcount in India grew to over 55,000 from 34,000 in 2018. Deepak Mangla, CEO, corporate centres, India, and Philippines at JPMorganChase, in a recent interaction with TOI, said its India operations are a microcosm of all lines of businesses and functions, not just technology. ""We consider ourselves a technology-driven bank. I think we have a very good strategy for distributed talent across the globe. We have more than 60,000 technologists at the firm and approximately one-third of them are in India. Our India corporate centres specifically employ 55,000 people, of which there are approximately 20,000 people in technology.""Gunjan Samtani, global COO of engineering at Goldman Sachs and country head of Goldman Sachs Services India, said over 120 global functions across business and engineering are carried out from its Indian GCCs in Bengaluru and Hyderabad, which employ 8,500 people. ""Over the last two decades, functions performed from India have evolved from end-of-day support for trading platforms and exchange connectivity to algo trading platform support, data analytics, and client reporting. Today, the India GCC is a centre of excellence with thought leadership for several equities engineering functions,"" he said.GCCs in India have emerged as a playbook for innovation hubs. Texas Instruments (TI) India, for instance, is one of the first players to enable end-to-end chip design in the country. ""TI engineers play a significant role in the entire chip design process, from concept to design, product engineering, testing and validating, and system software... Some of the best teams in the industry for product development exist here in TI India,"" said Santhosh Kumar, TI president and managing director.Goldman Sachs' India centre has developed Atlas, a low-latency trading platform that hosts a comprehensive suite of trading strategies to help clients achieve their trading objectives, perform historical analyses, build quantitative models with real-time market information, and trade execution. ""This platform helped trim microseconds in the execution of trades for our (low-latency trading) clients. The latency reduction from this platform helped us engage existing and newer hedge funds and quant clients,"" Samtani said.Recently, GE Aerospace CEO Larry Culp told TOI that the company's 1,200 engineers at the John F Welch Technology Centre in Bengaluru are involved in cutting-edge work on the future of aviation - including the Leap engine for narrow-body aircraft, the GEnx in the wide-body space, and the next-generation Rise platform for the narrow-body market. The company also announced an investment of over Rs 240 crore to expand and upgrade its manufacturing facility in Pune. The factory already produces components that are supplied to GE's global factories, where they are used to assemble engines like the G90, GEnx, GE9X, the world's most powerful commercial jet engine, and the Leap engines by CFM, a GE and Safran joint venture.Sangeeta Gupta, senior VP and chief strategy officer at Nasscom, said India will continue to be central to the growth of GCCs, making significant impacts across economic, human capital, innovation, social, and environmental dimensions. ""Talent will be a key driver of this growth, with both new and established centres expanding their capacities. There's a notable shift towards incorporating corporate functions, analytics, and AI, with tasks increasingly focusing on corporate functions, product management, decision support, and embedded systems capabilities.""Gupta added: ""GCCs are increasingly important to their parent enterprises, focusing on moving up the value chain, creating opportunities for future leadership, and enhancing their overall impact.""Ramkumar Ramamoorthy, partner in tech growth advisory firm Catalincs, said, ""With several hundred GCCs gaining critical size, I expect their employment numbers to accelerate from here. I will not be surprised if the GCC headcount crosses 4 million in India in the next five years. The other big impact that today's GCCs are making is the transfer of technology through R&D, and knowhow in newer areas such as product development and management, AI, cyber engineering, edge computing, synthetic biology, etc. The fact that ISB, IIMs and IITs today offer advanced programmes in product management is a case in point.""As the boundaries blur between tech and traditional industries, GCCs are becoming talent hotspots in newer areas like full-stack development, AI, IoT, embedded systems, and automation, reshaping global markets. ""Established GCCs are nurturing advanced skills beyond pure technology, including product management and architecture, where they are building deep domain expertise. This shift enables them to deliver higher-value work and gain a more comprehensive understanding of business contexts,"" said Pari Natarajan, CEO of global management consultancy Zinnov. Its research showed that the number of global roles in GCCs in India is projected to grow from a mere 115 in 2015 to 30,000 by 2030.Lalit Ahuja, founder of Bengaluru and US-based ANSR, which has set up over 120 GCCs, said GCCs have emerged as good paymasters, outshining their IT services peers in several roles across firms. Around 100 Indian GCCs have top leaders netting nearly $1 million in annual compensation, which includes cash and stock rewards, Ahuja added. These roles include India-based site leaders and senior VPs who lead technology functions.Arindam Sen, EY India Global Business Services & Operations partner, said roles like CIO, CTO, chief financial officer, chief procurement officer will be increasingly based out of India. ""People from these centres are growing within the organisation and assuming these roles. Either the role itself sits here or people selected from these centres as part of their talent strategy are eventually taking up those roles.""","GCCs in India have emerged as a playbook for innovation hubs. By 2030, GCCs will contribute a total revenue of $121 billion - roughly 3.5% of India's current GDP. GCCs added over 6 lakh new jobs between 2018-19 and 2023-24, taking total job count to over 16 lakh.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112577324,imgsize-918924,width-400,resizemode-4/112577324.jpg"
7% growth not coming with enough jobs: Gita Gopinath,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/7-growth-not-coming-with-enough-jobs-gopinath/articleshow/112573455.cms,"’s first deputy managing director

Gita Gopinath

, who is in India, spoke to TOI on a range of issues from the global crisis to AI and the need to create

jobs

. Excerpts:

How do you see wars and crises affecting the world and India?

Will it be difficult for countries like India to grow faster given that China, Korea or Japan had more favourable conditions?

India is doing very well in terms of growth. But is it getting carried away by the growth hype?

What would be your prescription or your suggestions on the reform agenda?

What are your views on the policy of incentivizing the private sector to create jobs?

How big is this challenge coming from artificial intelligence? How does it impact future job creation? There have been suggestions of a robot tax to create a social security buffer.

Can billionaire tax and wealth tax be effective in dealing with inequality?

Would you advocate a universal basic income for a country like India?

In the last few years, we have seen a big rise in geo-political uncertainty, that’s a reflection of the conflicts, Russian invasion of Ukraine, conflicts in the Middle East (West Asia).More generally, because of the pandemic and the war there has been a rethinking by countries of what should be the rules of engagement. It’s not always efficiency driven, but also driven by resilience, national security concerns. This is a very different environment from what we have lived in over the last three decades in terms of global integration.In the short term, the energy crisis that came after the war and the food insecurity fed into much higher cost of living in countries. But given that these conflicts remain, we could see a further increase, for example, in oil prices, which will have negative implications for many countries, including for India. The other aspect is just uncertainty. We are in a year of elections that brings a lot of uncertainty on the policy front. And uncertainty has a bit of a chilling effect on investments.Trade fragmentation is a serious concern. In 2022 and 2023 there were around 3,000 new trade restrictions that were put in place. We are seeing a lot of industrial policies in countries that are also tied to trade restricting measures grow. Countries that are geopolitically close are seeing trade hold up much better than countries that are geopolitically distant. We are still in the early stages of geo economic fragmentation. The risk of causing this could become much more severe, in which case there are no winners.Trade has been an engine of growth for countries, and there’s also been a lot of desire for reshoring production that affects the ability for other developing countries to benefit from trade. One of the political consequences is that countries are looking for other trade partners, they want to diversify. So being purely efficiency driven with focusing on one trade partner is now considered risky, which presents its opportunities to countries like India, because India is viewed favourably as a country to work with.It is very important for India and other nations to ensure that we have a well-functioning, multilateral, -based system.India is doing very well in terms of its growth rates. This year we have (projected) 7%, medium term growth (will be) 6.5- 7%; it’s contribution to global growth is 17%. It is one of the fastest growing major global economies in the world. To get to even higher growth numbers, to keep up the momentum, it would require a very strong reform agenda, that’s something govt is working on.The 7% growth is coming along with not as much employment creation, and that’s an area where attention needs to be given. If you look at investment, private investment, you’re seeing private investment strong in the household sector and real estate. But if you look at, say, investment in machinery and equipment, that’s not as strong.First, a continued focus on improving the ease of doing business in the regulatory environment, in terms of red tape, will be super helpful. We studied where did foreign direct investment go in India. Two states that stand out are Gujarat and Tamil Nadu, and the other states that also rank very well in terms of business climate.In the near term, labour market flexibility is important. That can be done because parliament approved new labour laws in 2020, but it needs implementation, and that's going to require regulations in the states. It’s going to require incentivizing the states to implement these laws.India’s s tariff rates are higher than for its peers. If India wants to be part of the global supply chains. Being part of global supply chains, you have to have fairly costless importing and exporting in the absence of that it is going to be hard to attract investment into the country.If you look at foreign direct investment in India, there is a lot of interest. You look at announced projects, we’re looking at large numbers, like $80 billion worth of projects. India’s opening up in being able to have fewer trade restrictions will help bring this investment in. Last, something the government has done really well is investing in public infrastructure, both the physical and the digital. But India still is an economy that needs a lot more, and the budget has put in additional funding for public investment.Then there is a more medium term. Increasing levels of education, increasing skilling, including digital digital skills, are going to be important. Second, agricultural sector reforms are going to be important.It’s certainly a measure that has been and tested. Incentives help. There is the employment linked incentive that was part of the budget that certainly is addressing the problem. As with all policies, it’s important at some point to do a cost-benefit analysis. We crunched some numbers and additional jobs that need to be created between now and 2030 cumulatively ranges between 60 million and 148 million. To get that kind of job creation to happen, it will require broad based reforms.There are risks. First, AI, as always, with general purpose technologies, offers the promise of raising productivity growth, which in general is good for jobs and for productivity. But on the other hand, given the nature of this technology, the risks in terms of displacing labour are also there. There is a lot of uncertainty about all of these numbers. Some estimates are close to zero, and some of them are very large. It depends upon how quickly this can be adapted into the economy.We have our own study; on average, for the world, about 40% of jobs are exposed to AI. That doesn't mean it’s a bad thing, about half that are complemented by AI and half that are substituted by AI. So the impact can be quite large, depending upon how this technology develops.In terms of the question of what this implies for taxation, first, all policy makers should be paying pretty close attention to how AI is developing and being adopted, because it has implications on multiple fronts. There is a regulatory aspect of it, the technology being ethically used, and data disclosures being respected.AI tax depends on the specifics. Whether there should be a (robot) tax, our view is, no because we believe in efficiency and in productivity. But that said, it is helpful for governments around the world, to look at their tax structures, because you could actually end up incentivizing automation in a direction right now. Sometimes you may incentivize it for good reasons, but sometimes it’s just that you haven't paid enough attention, and your marginal effective tax rate is much lower for automating than for hiring a worker. We have done some analysis that shows that is indeed the case. There are countries, especially some advanced economies, where it seems to be more favouring automation and away from labour.IMF is in favour of a progressive tax structure. We think better implementation of what's there in terms of capital income taxes, property taxes can be encoded into the tax system properly. With wealth taxes, there are some additional complications. For example, for a lot of people, wealth is basically their home. There are implementation issues associated with it, but if you can get capital income tax, well, well done.If you are truly universal it means everybody, (and) that’s very costly for countries. So, either you give everybody extremely little, in which case, it doesn't really have an impact. Or, if you give them a meaningful amount, it is a very large amount of money. So, it is fiscally large. The point is to do this in a much more targeted fashion, as many countries do, but that's something that we have seen is if you increase the generosity of unemployment insurance.","India is doing very well in terms of growth.

Why it’s time to explore bold & path-breaking alternatives that put Indian Railways on a smooth track,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-its-time-to-explore-bold-path-breaking-alternatives-that-put-indian-railways-on-a-smooth-track/articleshow/112317406.cms,"By Ashutosh Bhandari

Railway Budget 2024 : The government has wavered little in its efforts to spur a modernisation of railways in the country, pivoting on technology, to support the country’s economic ambitions. In line with expectations, Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore, marking yet another year of successive increase in outlay.That takes forward the past policies and the government’s vision, which have paved the way for modernisation of the transport behemoth.In earlier decades, the government had focused on laying tracks on new routes, electrification and incremental rolling stock capacity addition. That was the need of the hour back then and has helped set up the base for a larger transformation.For instance, the massive Dedicated Freight Corridor ( DFC ) as well as locomotive factories at Marhaura and Madhepura in Bihar were conceptualised over a decade ago and we are seeing their completion now.More recently, the focus has shifted to modernisation—of rolling stock and safety systems, among other aspects.This year, emphasis has also been laid on the railways’ crucial role in industrial development. Commodity-specific corridors have been planned in eastern India and impetus given to port connectivity. Vande Bharat and technology-led upgrades in rolling stock remain in focus. Safety has been prioritised through budgetary allocations for the anti-collision systemKavach . That said, there are other cogs in the wheel that demand attention from a long-term perspective.First, the target for the Operating Ratio, the crucial efficiency gauge, has been set at 98.22% for 2024-25, compared with 98.65% in 2023-24. This reflects an imminent need for operational transformation. An effective overhaul of the world’s fourth-largest rail network will take many years and thus we need to start focusing on improving efficiency and reducing costs now.DFC is almost entirely operational and will be complete over the next few months. To ensure the project achieves its twin goals of reducing logistics costs and enhancing freight efficiency, railways need to attract more cargo on the corridor. This will help increase the rail coefficient and make the railways’ approach more market-oriented, which will in turn aid future corridors.A revamp of railway stations is on track, with sufficient funds dedicated to this end. But even though new coaches and wagons are increasingly being added to meet footfalls, the stations and passenger trains themselves remain synonymous with chaos.Just as safety, comfort and convenience have been prioritised, there is a need for solutions to address the capacity and demand challenges. As a first step, the government could target development of new stations and setting up of new coach production units.As a leading freight mover, Indian Railways carried a record 1,588 MT cargo in fiscal 2024, up from 1,095 MT in fiscal 2015. It accounts for 26% of the cargo moved in the country—by no means an easy feat. The railways aims to take this volume to 3,000 MT by 2030, which would require a 11% CAGR against the around 4.2% witnessed over the last 10 years. As per a report by TERI and Shakti Foundation, from carrying about 62% of freight traffic in 1990-91, Indian Railways’ share has declined to ~27% in 2014-15. This has been due to the expanding road network, cost competitiveness over railways, and door-to-door service. Thus, commencing the cycle of increasing the rail share again is commendable.DFCs, a high-capacity track network, high-power locomotives and improvement in wagon designs have set the ball rolling for larger capacity, faster freight trains that deliver better efficiency.Yet, achieving exponential growth is a tall ask given the current dynamics. Possibly, similar challenges might apply to other goals the railways might have for 2047.To be fair, despite its scale and complexity, Indian Railways has been able to achieve diverse developments at commendable speed.But the track ahead is long and it is time to start discussing the reinvention of the institutional set-up.Indian Railways sees substantial private sector involvement in the form of vendors and contractors. Policymakers could start mulling extreme options such as parallel privately-owned and operated railway infrastructure, coupled with centralised planning and an evolved role for the railways. This will need a robust policy framework from the Government of India.The time is perhaps also ripe to bring user charge and asset monetisation-driven segments for passengers as well as cargo to the discussion table. Globally, the separation of infrastructure and operations in railways has delivered mixed results, for example in the United Kingdom. The model should be analysed and revisited to understand its potential relevance in the Indian context.The key would be to retrace our steps and align our long-term goals to identify not just incremental changes but also ways to explore bold and path-breaking alternatives that put Indian Railways on a smooth track and bring it up to speed.","Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore.

Budget 2024 capital gains tax changes: The Narendra Modi government is considering suggestions for tweaks in the new long term capital gains tax regime that was announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman in Union Budget 2024.The July 23 budget reduced the LTCG tax on property from 20% to 12.5%. The indexation benefit, which allowed taxpayers to adjust the acquisition cost for inflation before calculating capital gains and thus reduce their tax liability, is proposed to be eliminated for properties purchased on or after April 1, 2001.The government publishes the Cost Inflation Index (CII) annually for this calculation.India Inc is appealing to the government for a gradual shift to the long-term capital gains tax regime proposed in the FY25 budget, which aims to eliminate indexation benefits for property, gold, and other unlisted assets.According to an ET report by Deepshikha Sikarwar, the industry is suggesting alternatives such as a higher tax rate with indexation or a lower rate of 12.5% without indexation, as well as some form of grandfathering for ancestral properties.The finance ministry is currently reviewing these proposals and will discuss them with the Prime Minister's Office. The final decision will be made closer to the date when the Finance Bill reply is to be presented in Parliament, the reports said.Industry groups are expected to submit formal proposals to the finance ministry in the near future.

Budget 2024 adopts multifaceted approach to bolstering manufacturing sector,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2024-adopts-multifaceted-approach-to-bolstering-manufacturing-sector/articleshow/112216383.cms,"By Saurabh Agarwal and Mohit Sharma

Budget 2024 for manufacturing sector : The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth. While the middle class has been offered tax relief, the government's primary focus remains on judicious spending to maximize economic impact. The budget's core themes are employment, skilling, MSME development, and support for the middle class.Largely focus has remained intact on spending money judiciously to ensure that each penny spent creates a ripple effect in the entire economic landscape.Although at first glance, manufacturing might appear to have taken a backseat, a deeper analysis reveals a multifaceted approach to bolstering the sector. Initiatives like employment-linked benefits and internship programs, while primarily aimed at job creation and skill development, indirectly benefit manufacturing companies by expanding the talent pool.Extensive focus on the MSME manufacturing units by way of extending term loan facility for purchase of machinery and equipment without collateral or third-party guarantee, would help companies in augmenting their capital base/ capacity and strengthen the very foundation of the manufacturing ecosystem in the country. Development of a new credit-assessment model by Public Sector Banks to assess MSME credit shall provide much needed regulatory relief to the units.With respect to the large manufacturing entities, while there is no direct fiscal/ tax incentive introduced in this budget, some support has been provided with an extensive focus on development of ‘industrial parks’ in nearly 100 cities under the ‘plug and play’ model. Reforms proposed with respect to land administration, planning and management, shall also ease out acquisition related difficulties often faced by entrepreneurs/ business houses in acquiring lands for manufacturing set-ups.Targeted Customs duty interventions like, rationalization of Customs duty provisions in Mobile phone manufacturing setups, extension of Customs duty exemption on import of capital goods for manufacturing of solar cells and panels, full Customs duty exemption on import of 25 critical minerals,, shall provide the required impetus for enhancing domestic manufacturing environment.Governments’ focus on formulating an Economic Policy Framework to set the scope for next-gen reforms in the country, has a target to improve the productivity of factors of production, namely, land, labour, capital, entrepreneurship and technology. This shall pave the way for enabling achievement of a target of 25% manufacturing sector contribution to the nation’s GDP over the course of next 7-10 years.While the overall outlook is positive, the extension of tax benefits under Section 115BAB for manufacturing entities and the absence of new PLI schemes are notable omissions.The country’s manufacturing base is expanding as is reflective from the continuously increasing tax collections and expanding Purchasing Manager’s Index. It would be pertinent to see how the ground realities evolve vis-à-vis the vision envisaged, in the upcoming Financial Year.","The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth.

Budget 2024: Armed with the vision to propel India to become a developed country by 2047, the Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business thereby providing the required stimulus to the manufacturing sector and enabling large scale job creation.On the Indirect tax front, the industry welcomes the much-needed announcement for a comprehensive review of the rate structure under Customs enabling ease in product classification and dispute reduction. The proposal of lowering of Customs duty on a plethora of raw materials and products including solar cells, critical minerals and bullion are encouraging measures. The rationale behind such reduction clearly indicates support towards domestic manufacturing, deepening value addition and supporting targets in reducing carbon footprint.Relevant amendments under the Customs law have been made to provide increased time limits for re-imports and re-exports to enhance competitiveness of the fledgling MRO sector. The government has extended significant duty reduction and exemption benefits to the healthcare and electronics sectors, continuing the impetus of incentives provided under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme.Since their introduction in March 2020, the PLI schemes have indeed supported in revitalizing the manufacturing sector and strengthening the necessary supply chains. The success achieved in the mobile manufacturing sector has now enabled the Government to reduce customs duties on mobile phones and components, signalling a mature environment. The Budget proposals aim at reproducing similar outcomes for semiconductor and pharmaceutical industry by increasing the budgetary allocation.Buoyed by the increasing revenue collection under GST signalling a shift towards a mature tax regime, this Budget has harmonized the timeframes for the issuance of demand notices and adjudication orders for cases involving fraud, suppression or otherwise. Significant amendments to the GST legislations have been introduced reflecting the recommendations proposed by the GST Council such as regularizing non-levy of GST due to general practice which may turn out to be a breather for certain impacted industries reeling under huge tax demands.The Insurance sector has been provided much relief through the GST council recommendations which have been cemented in the present budget thereby ending long standing disputes on their business practices.The Government's efforts to push forward with its reform agenda are evident as plans to incentivize states for their business reform actions plans and digitalization through the Jan Vishwas Bill 2.0 is proposed. Further, setting up of e-commerce export hubs is envisaged to facilitate easier access to international markets for domestic players.The recent implementation of Budget proposals allows the government to maintain momentum in its reform agenda. These policy measures implicitly reaffirm the significance of India Inc as a crucial element in the development of infrastructure. However, there are still some expectations required to be met to march towards a Viksit Bharat 2047.",The Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business.

Budget 2024 : Real estate, a significant contributor to employment generation, has received a fair bit of attention in Budget 2024-25. Recent years have seen the sector transform rapidly, driven by factors such as favourable government policies, Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, strong economic growth and changing consumer preferences.Added to that, the budgetary focus on job creation, skilling and employment-linked incentives, infrastructure, urban development, rural connectivity, digitalisation and land-related norms, all dovetail to promote growth of the sector.Launched in June 2015, the PMAY aims to provide affordable housing to all eligible beneficiaries. The budget unveiled PMAY Urban 2.0, under which the housing needs of 1 crore urban poor and middle class will be addressed with an investment of Rs 10 lakh crore.The central government’s additional Rs 2.2 lakh crore injection in the next 5 years to make housing more affordable has the potential to revitalise the affordable housing market.Such an approach can play an important role in realising the government's vision of Housing for All and push growth and development. Hence, the significant investment under PMAY Urban 2.0 is expected to alleviate urban housing deficits, spurring construction and economic growth.Steps to introduce technological reforms within the regulatory framework for land, such as digitalisation or GIS mapping of land records, will improve transparency.Rationalisation of stamp duty across states will also be critical to bring in uniformity and initiate land-related reforms such as urban planning, usage and building bylaws.These are steps in the right direction and will boost growth. Moreover, they will improve the ease of property transactions and strengthen municipal finances through increased property taxes. Rationalization of stamp duty with an emphasis on women homebuyers may boost home-buyer sentiment in major cities, too.The budget has also given ample attention to urban and rural development, with rental housing for industrial workers through the public private partnership model, interest subsidies for rental housing, and transit-oriented developments.The proposal to develop investment-ready plug-and-play industrial parks in 100 cities may attract industrial investment, leading to increased demand for industrial real estate and support the growth of ancillary services and residential developments in these regions.Initiatives for industrial parks and rental housing for industrial workers align with the country’s manufacturing goals and addresses worker accommodation needs.These steps are expected to promote industrial growth and stability in labour-intensive sectors, while also creating new opportunities for real estate developers specialising in rental and affordable housing.The changes in long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax, however, have evoked a mixed reaction. The government lowered the long-term capital gains tax from 20% to 12.5%, which is a welcome step. However, this came with the removal of the indexation benefit.The changes could encourage more liquidity in property transactions and potentially increase the effective tax burden depending on the property’s acquisition date.The launch of Phase IV of the PM Gram Sadak Yojana in 25,000 rural habitations will improve connectivity in rural areas, promoting rural development and making these regions more accessible for investment. The primary objective of PMGSY is to build robust, all-weather roads in rural habitations. This initiative focuses on enhancing connectivity and supporting economic development in rural areas.In essence, the budget is geared towards stimulating growth and investment in the real estate sector , fostering a more transparent and investor-friendly environment, and contributing to overall development. It aims to create a balanced and inclusive growth environment by addressing the needs of various segments, including affordable housing, industrial workers and urban infrastructure.The effectiveness of the initiatives, however, hinges on their implementation and continued support of complementary reforms.","Budget 2024-25 is geared towards stimulating growth and investment in the real estate sector.

New Budget 2024 rule: Why Income Tax Department is likely to issue a huge number of tax notices this month,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-budget-2024-rule-why-income-tax-department-is-likely-to-issue-a-huge-number-of-tax-notices-this-month/articleshow/112186079.cms,"Taxing Times

Income Tax Notice on the way? The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month, as there are concerns that many taxpayers might escape the tax net due to the impending implementation of the new reassessment law on September 1, 2024.According to the amended regulation announced in Budget 2024 , the tax authorities can only go back a maximum of five years to reassess a taxpayer's records if the escaped income is at least Rs 50 lakh, and three years for an amount less than Rs 50 lakh.Previously, they could reassess cases up to 10 years old.According to an ET report, tax officials are now faced with the challenge of compiling and corroborating data on tax and income mismatches for the financial years 2013-14 to 2017-18 within the next few weeks, as these years will become time-barred for reassessment from September 1, 2024.The I-T department relies on information from various sources, such as banks, property registrars, and search findings from the investigation wing, to build reassessment cases.A tax officers' body has raised concerns about the feasibility of issuing notices under Section 148 (or 148A) in a large number of cases within a single month, given the overburdened nature of the jurisdictional assessing officers and the time-consuming process of obtaining sanction from the chief commissioner, who is the specified authority for such notices.Moreover, the law provides taxpayers with the right to explain their position before reassessment orders are finalized, a process that most believe cannot be completed by the end of August.Also Read | ITR refund status for FY 2023-24: How to check income tax refund status online - here’s a step-by-step guide for incometax.gov.in & NSDL websites The Central Board of Direct Taxes ( CBDT ) has been urged by its officers to postpone the effective date of the proposed amendment. However, this suggestion is unlikely to be well-received by corporations and high net worth individuals.""Capping the reassessment period at five years was a great decision as it would reduce hassles and litigation. But if the department fears there could be a genuine loss of revenue as it may not be possible to wrap up several matters by August 31, the government can think of strict parameters where time-bound cases can be selectively reopened - based on trails of steps taken in identifying escaped income,"" said Mitil Chokshi, partner at CA firm Chokshi & Chokshi.""Taxpayers may expect a rush of reassessment notices in August 2024. These notices are likely to be for the AYs 2018-19 and prior to that. It is pertinent to note that the Bombay High Court in a recent ruling in a case of Hexaware Technologies has taken a view on a proviso introduced in 2021, which can be interpreted to mean that AY 2017-18 (and prior years) got time barred on March 31, 2024. These reassessment notices (for AYs 2017-18 and prior) are likely to rake up new interpretation issues in the already muddled reassessment provisions,"" said Ashish Mehta, partner at law firm Khaitan & Co.The current situation is similar to the conflict between the Income Tax office and taxpayers in 2021. The reassessment law was amended in April 2021, allowing the tax office to reopen 10-year-old tax returns if the total undisclosed income exceeded Rs 50 lakh and reassess 4-year-old matters if the amount was less than Rs 50 lakh.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? However, this change led to over 10,000 writ petitions being filed by companies, arguing that they were not given sufficient time to explain and that the notices were issued without considering the carve-out that cases which couldn't be reopened earlier couldn't be reassessed under the new law.The Supreme Court invoked its extraordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution on May 4, 2022, to uphold all reassessment notices issued after March 31, 2021. However, the court left room for judicial proceedings based on the merits of each case, and several such matters are currently pending before the court.","The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month.

The last Budget presented by the Manmohan Singh government in 2014 was of Rs 16 lakh crore. Ten years later, the Union Budget 2024 presented by us a few days ago is Rs 48 lakh crore, which is three times, Modi said.Modi also said that the capital expenditure allocation under his governments has grown manifold.""Capital expenditure is called the biggest productive medium of resource investment,"" he said at the ‘Journey Towards Viksit Bharat: A Post Union Budget 2024-25' conference. In 2004, the capex allocation of UPA’s first Budget was Rs 90,000 crore. This increased to only Rs 2 lakh crore in the last UPA budget in 2014, Modi said. At present the capex allocation is over Rs 11 lakh crore, Modi added. Modi pointed out that the capex allocation of railways and highways has become 8 times under his government.PM Modi said that India, which is currently the world’s fifth largest economy, will soon become the third largest. He also noted the time when India had been ranked among the ‘Fragile Five’ economies in the world.

He also said that India's fiscal prudence has become an example for the world to see.Modi spoke of the government's initiatives to transform the manufacturing sector of the economy with steps like 'Make in India', Production Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes, liberalisation of FDI norms, setting up of multi-modal logistics hubs.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman presented the first Union Budget of the newly elected NDA government on July 23, 2024.","PM Modi said that India, which is currently the world’s fifth largest economy, will soon become the third largest.

Are NPS Vatsalya & hiked NPS deduction limit for private sector employees good moves from Budget 2024?

NPS and EPF: Overlapping services

What is NPS Vatsalaya?

Latest NPS rules, news: In the Union Budget 2024 speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced two new initiatives with regard to National Pension Scheme (NPS) - extension of NPS 14% employer contribution benefits to private setcor and the intended launch of NPS Vatsalya.Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries, bringing it at par with the provisions available for government employees.Sriram Iyer, CEO, HDFC Pension Management told ET that with this move the “ground rules have been harmonised among government and non-government employees, which is a positive step.”Effectively, this means that now, private-sector employees can choose to reduce the taxable portion of employers’ contribution to their NPS corpus, thereby paying less tax and leaving greater funds in their pension deposits.“Employees will benefit from tax savings . More importantly, the 40% increase in contribution will have a significant impact on the terminal value of the retirement corpus,” remarked Iyer. The extended savings will “help in retirement planning, working as an option that is at par with the Provident Fund,” Dinesh Rohira, CEO & Founder, 5nance.com was quoted as saying.Moreover, the endeavour aims to increase NPS penetration by increasing tax incentives for the private sector, providing them a social security-cushion post-retirement.The scheme’s motive to widen the NPS subscriber base may not prove to be flawlessly effective, however. This is explained by Agrees Mrin Agarwal, Founder, Finsafe India: “While it’s good that the limit has been raised, it may not increase adoption as employees need to be educated in a big way. Also, the benefit is only for the salaried opting for the new tax regime,” she says.The mandatory contribution to the EPF, too, threatens to relegate the provisions of NPS under the umbrella of near-superfluity. This sentiment is echoed by Varun Sahay, a software engineer in a Delhi-based IT company: “When 12% of my salary is already deducted for the EPF, why should I put in more in the NPS and cut my take-home pay?”Rohira feels otherwise. “There’s no competition between the NPS and EPF as employees can contribute to both and build a 3-4 times bigger corpus while earning 3-4% higher returns via marketlinked options in the NPS,” he counters.Also Check | New Tax Regime 2023 vs 2024 After Budget: How Much Income Tax Will Salaried Taxpayers Save & How Do New Tax Slabs Compare To Old Regime? Top 10 Points You Must Know To jumpstart retirement savings for children, a new initiative called NPS Vatsalya has been unveiled in the Budget. This scheme allows parents and guardians to contribute to a minor's account, which can be converted into a regular NPS account once the child reaches adulthood.""It provides a very long duration for reaping the compounding benefits and accumulating a huge bounty at a later age. This can be a good way to plan a better future for kids who may not opt for a service segment in the future,"" says Rohira. Sriram Iyer agrees, stating, ""It’s a good move to help the child start his retirement journey. Even if a parent starts when the child is 10 years old, by the time he starts working, it can be a solid foundation for the compounding journey after that.""However, some experts question the utility of a product with such a long lock-in period, especially when parents cannot use the funds for essential goals like their child’s education amidst soaring education costs of 11-12%.""Parents are struggling to save for their own retirement, so it might be a bit of a stretch to expect them to save for their kids’ retirement. The need of the hour is a market-linked product that allows withdrawals only for the child’s education,"" says Mrin Agarwal, Founder of Finsafe India.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? Though the NPS permits partial withdrawals, it allows only 25% of the corpus after three years of joining, and this can be done only three times during the entire tenure. A premature exit before 60 years with 100% withdrawal is only possible if the corpus is less than Rs.2.5 lakh, an amount insufficient for most children's goals.""In its current form, there won’t be any uptake,"" asserts Agarwal. Rohira concurs, ""It’s a vanilla product with a lock-in, which does not make it very attractive and it may not take off. However, the government may optimise it and introduce new features later."" Iyer adds, ""This is just a start and there may be more subscriber-friendly features as we take it to the market. The regulator is proactive and open to feedback.""","Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries.

Gold import duty cut: Why Indians may not find buying gold from Dubai as attractive post Budget 2024,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-import-duty-cut-why-indians-may-not-find-buying-gold-from-dubai-as-attractive-post-budget-2024/articleshow/112097671.cms,"Gold import duty cut in Budget 2024: The recent reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai. Indian jewellers with stores in both India and the UAE believe that the narrowed duty differential will result in lower gold prices in India, making it less attractive for Indians to purchase gold in Dubai.The emirate had attracted gold-enthusiast Indians following a steep rise in customs duty in India in July 2022. In the fiscal 2024-25 budget, the duty on gold imports was more than halved.The duty cut is also expected to boost gold jewellery production in India, particularly the popular 'Kolkatti' jewellery from Kolkata, which is favored by Indian expats in Dubai and tourists from various countries. This move will encourage gold artisans to create new designs in both heavyweight and lightweight jewellery, attracting consumers to purchase gold from India.According to an ET report, Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group , estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India as Indian tourists who previously bought jewellery in Dubai will now prefer to shop in India. However, Indian expats living in Dubai and other customers may continue to buy from the UAE.Also Read | Gold losing sheen? Government cuts gold bond issuance target as investors look at better alternatives Rajiv Popley, director at Popley & Sons, believes that the perception of overseas gold being cheaper than in India is merely a mindset. He points out that the labour cost is significantly lower in India, and with the introduction of mandatory hallmarking and HUID numbers, the purity of gold in India is no longer a concern.Furthermore, NRIs in Dubai do not receive VAT refunds, and Indians travelling abroad only receive about 60% of the VAT back on their gold purchases. Gold trade analyst Bhargav Baidya suggests that the 1% duty differential between gold jewellery in India and Dubai will be offset by Indian jewellers offering discounts to retain and attract customers.Saurabh Gadgil, chairman of PNG Jewellers, notes that Indian import duty is now on par with the US, allowing Indian jewellers to offer competitive prices compared to other countries worldwide. The reduced customs duty is expected to make gold purchases in India more attractive and convenient for Indian consumers, potentially leading to a significant shift in their gold shopping preferences.",The reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai.

Gold losing sheen? The government has reduced its target for issuing gold bonds in the financial year 2024-25 by 38% compared to the previous interim budget goal, according to a senior official. The revised target stands at Rs 18,500 crore, down from Rs 29,638 crore estimated in the interim budget and Rs 26,852 crore (revised estimate) in 2023-24.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told ET ""The decision followed a reassessment of various factors, including investor demand, other investment products and uncertainties around the global economy, as the situation has changed since the interim budget in February.""After accounting for redemptions, the net issuances of sovereign gold bonds are now estimated at Rs 15,000 crore for this fiscal year, a significant decrease from the Rs 26,138 crore projected in the interim budget and Rs 25,352 crore in the revised estimate for 2023-24.Harish Galipelli, director at ILA Commodities India, attributed this shift to retail investors increasingly opting for equities in anticipation of better returns. He also noted that people are uncertain about the potential for further increases in gold prices in the short-to-medium term following a recent rally. Additionally, Galipelli pointed out that savings in rural areas have been impacted by retail inflation and other factors.The gold bond and gold monetisation schemes were introduced by the government in late 2015 to discourage the physical purchase of precious metals and reduce imports, thereby mitigating the negative impact on the current account deficit.The gross collection through these two schemes is now projected to be Rs 20,030 crore in 2024-25, compared to Rs 31,168 crore in the interim budget and Rs 28,240 crore (revised estimate) in the previous fiscal year. Similarly, the net collection is estimated at Rs 16,433 crore, down from Rs 27,571 crore in the interim budget and Rs 26,653 crore in the previous year.

Both schemes were designed to curb gold imports, which, along with crude oil, have been significant contributors to India's current account deficit.

Mid-tier IT companies beat bigger peers in hikes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/mid-tier-it-companies-beat-bigger-peers-in-hikes/articleshow/112575619.cms,"BENGALURU: In recent years, some mid-sized IT companies have outperformed their larger counterparts in terms of employee compensation , offering more substantial salary increases. Companies such as Birlasoft, KPIT, Happiest Minds , and Cyient have consistently provided double-dig it average salary hikes over the past three financial years.In contrast, many larger IT firms have restricted their salary increases to a range of 5% to 9%.Large IT companies offered double-digit hikes in 2021-22, when they were striving to retain talent to meet the increased demand brought about by the pandemic. Cyient, for example, doubled its hike 10.4% in 2023-24, while KPIT's average increment rose by 60% to 16% during the same period.Pareekh Jain, CEO and lead analyst at Pareekh Consulting, attributes this trend to mid-tier companies' reliance on lateral talent rather than freshers. He expects the hikes to moderate but believes these companies will continue to offer better salaries than their larger counterparts. ""Many mid-tiers pay higher salaries for junior or mid-level roles in comparison to bigger firms to attract talent from bigger firms. Mid-tier IT firms want to maintain that gap to retain talent by giving higher hikes. This could also indicate that mid-tiers are more confident and want to retain talent when growth is expected to return,"" Jain said.Sunil C, the India country manager at Adecco, said that some employees at mid-cap firms have received salary raises of 20% to 25% in 2023-24. He attributes this trend to the leaner structures of mid-tier companies, which enable them to make decisions more quickly.

TMC maintained that the protestors at the hospital were not students but ""outsider politicians"" trying to stoke unrest in the state. The march led by the CM will start at 3pm in Kolkata.Anticipating widespread disruptions, the state govt has issued a notification warning that absence from work, unless pre-approved or due to medical emergencies or family bereavements, will be treated as a ""break in service"".Speaking to reporters on Thursday, CM Banerjee addressed the vandalism: ""I don't blame students. Some outsider politicians are trying to foment trouble in Bengal. This is a BJP-Left collusion...

"Core US inflation eases a fourth month, sealing Fed rate cut",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/core-us-inflation-eases-a-fourth-month-sealing-fed-rate-cut/articleshow/112529157.cms,"Underlying US inflation eased for a fourth month on an annual basis in July, keeping the Federal Reserve on track to lower interest rates next month.The so-called core consumer price index — which excludes food and energy costs — increased 3.2% in July from a year ago, still the slowest pace since early 2021. The monthly measure rose 0.2%, a slight pickup from June’s surprisingly low reading, Bureau of Labor Statistics figures showed Wednesday.Economists see the core gauge as a better indicator of underlying inflation than the overall CPI.That measure also climbed 0.2% from the prior month and 2.9% from a year ago. BLS said nearly 90% of the monthly advance was due to shelter, which accelerated from June.Inflation is still broadly on a downward trend as the economy slowly shifts into a lower gear. Combined with a softening job market, the Fed is widely expected to start lowering interest rates next month, while the size of the cut will likely be determined by more incoming data.“Investors and policymakers alike will find this report mostly good for markets and the economy,” said Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial. “As inflation decelerates, the Fed can legitimately cut rates yet keep policy restrictive overall.”Before their September meeting, officials will get more inflation readings plus another jobs report — which will be heavily scrutinized after the disappointing July figures helped spark a global market selloff and fanned recession fears.Fed Chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues have recently said they’re focusing more on the labor side of their dual mandate, which they’re likely to stress at their annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming next week.The S&P 500 fluctuated and two-year Treasury yields — the most sensitive to Fed policy — rose. Traders assigned a lower probability of a 50-basis-point cut in September.Though the figures are reported to one decimal point by the BLS, Fed officials and economists like to look further out for a better sense of the inflation trajectory. On a two-decimal basis, core CPI rose 0.17%. And to get a feel for the recent trend, the three-month annualized figure advanced 1.58%, the lowest since February 2021.The most disappointing part of the report was shelter prices, which economists and policymakers have been widely expecting to ease and help move inflation closer to the Fed’s target. Shelter, the largest category within services, jumped 0.4% after 0.2% in June, which was the lowest since 2021 and thought to be the start of the long-awaited slowdown.Within shelter, owners’ equivalent rent — the biggest individual component of the CPI — also rose 0.4%. Rent of primary residence climbed 0.5%, the most since February.Other categories were more encouraging, particularly for consumers. Prices fell last month for apparel, new and used cars and airfares. Hospital services declined by the most on record. Gasoline prices have mostly dropped in recent months.Meantime, subscription services for video games rose by the most ever after registering a steep decline in May.Excluding housing and energy, service prices were up 0.2%, the first increase in three months but still a tame pace, according to Bloomberg calculations. While central bankers have stressed the importance of looking at such a metric when assessing the nation’s inflation trajectory, they compute it based on a separate index.That measure, known as the personal consumption expenditures price index, doesn’t put as much weight on shelter as the CPI does — and that’s part of the reason why the PCE gauge is trending closer to the Fed’s 2% target.The PCE measure, released later this month, draws from the CPI as well as certain categories within the producer price index. Those parts of the PPI were fairly tame in July, and the headline figures rose by less than forecast, according to government data out Tuesday.Part of the lower PPI reading stemmed from weaker margins at wholesalers and retailers — corroborating companies’ assertion that they’re losing pricing power as well as recent discounting and promotional activity like Amazon.com Inc.’s Prime Day. From restaurants to airlines, businesses recognize that consumers are growing more discerning in their spending, particularly for discretionary purchases.A sustained decline in the price of goods over most of the past year has largely been providing some relief to consumers. So-called core goods prices, which exclude food and energy commodities, fell by the most since the start of the year. On an annual basis, they dropped by the most since 2004.A separate report Wednesday that combines the inflation figures with recent wage data showed that real earnings growth decelerated in July from a year ago.","Core CPI, which excludes food and energy costs, rose 3.2% in July from a year ago.

On the other hand, Chipotle shares slid 7.5%, for a loss in value of $5.7 billion.Niccol is being hailed as the top public restaurant CEO in the US by several analysts, including Bloomberg Intelligence’s Michael Halen, who said the hire is a “no brainer.” Oppenheimer & Co’s Brian Bittner said Niccol is a “dream hire” for Starbucks. In just a few hours following the announcement, the stock received at least four upgrades, with Niccol earning praise for his successful track record as chief at Chipotle, as well as at Taco Bell, which is owned by Yum Brands.The optimism is well deserved. Chipotle shares climbed 773% since Niccol took over as CEO in March 5, 2018 through Monday’s close. Starbucks shares are up just 35% for the same period, while the S&P 500 has gained 99%.“In our view, Starbucks picks up a hall of fame restaurant CEO, and his appointment as Starbucks CEO and Chairman suggests a new era is underway,” according to TD Cowen analyst Andrew Charles, who upgraded Starbucks to buy from hold. Charles said he sees similarities between the turnaround at Chipotle and what Starbucks needs to do to improve traffic, including in marketing, product innovation, and operations.Danilo Gargiulo, a restaurants analyst at Bernstein, writes to clients that “while it is always hard to find the ‘right time’ to enter a stock, we doubt investors will find a better time to consider a position in Starbucks if the new CEO brings the same rigor as when turning around Chipotle.” He currently rates Starbucks market perform.","Shares of Seattle-based Starbucks surged 25%, the most ever, and added $21.4 billion in market capitalization.
