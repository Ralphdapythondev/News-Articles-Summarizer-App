"'Hands were shaking': Google engineer details personal experience after tech gaint lays off employees, disbands entire python team",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/hands-were-shaking-google-engineer-details-personal-experience-after-tech-gaint-lays-off-employees-disbands-entire-python-team/articleshow/109701469.cms,"NEW DELHI: Alphabet-owned Google has commenced a round of layoffs, according to several media reports, indicating the latest cost-cutting measures within the technology giant.Reports suggest that Google has disbanded its entire Python team , purportedly in an effort to streamline expenses by outsourcing work to cheaper labor markets outside the US.A former Google employee, Matt Hu , took to LinkedIn to recount the night he discovered his layoff, along with his manager and several team members.Hu, a software engineer at Google for the past two years, shared his experience of receiving the unsettling news.As Hu opened his laptop around 9 pm, he encountered a perplexing email indicating a ""Cloudtop StopInstance operation."" Sensing trouble, Hu's apprehensions intensified when he lost access to multiple sites and experienced a forced laptop reboot. Subsequently, an email titled ""Notice regarding your employment"" confirmed his fears - his tenure at Google had abruptly ended.""I went downstairs and opened up my laptop. That was 21:00. I got a weird email saying 'You Cloudtop StopInstance operation has begun' and I suddenly recalled I just had the cloudtop maintenance a few days back, it couldn't be a scheduled task, there is definitely something bad happening.

Ola Cabs lays off 10% employees; CEO quits in three months,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/ola-cabs-lays-off-10-employees-ceo-quits-in-three-months/articleshow/109703214.cms,"MUMBAI: Ola Cabs is laying off 10% or close to 200 employees as part of its restructuring exercise ahead of a planned initial public offering (IPO), sources said. The company aims to file its draft IPO papers with markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) in three months and get listed in the bourses later this year. The support teams have largely been impacted by the move which also comes amid the company’s increased focus on deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) in its operations while the core technology and product teams are understood to have not been affected by the downsizing process.In a letter to employees which was reviewed by TOI, founder Bhavish Aggarwal said that the restructuring exercise is aimed at “improving profitability” and preparing the company for the “next phase of growth.”In a separate development, the Bengaluru-based firm’s CEO Hemant Bakshi quit from his position within three months of joining the company. Ola Cabs declined to comment. Aggarwal said that Bakshi is leaving to pursue opportunities outside the company.The job cuts come amid the company’s attempts to build a leaner team structure and grow sustainably. The firm claims to have already posted operational profits of Rs 250 crore on a standalone basis in FY23 against losses of Rs 66 crore in the year ago period. “Profitability is a lucrative proposition for the public markets and the firm wants to further build on it,” a source aware of the company’s thinking said. Aggarwal said that the company has made substantial investments in areas of AI and technology which has led to significant cost advantages. “….we will continue to focus on these areas to ensure that we build cutting edge products and services across our business verticals. These changes will result in certain roles within the company becoming redundant,” Aggarwal said.Subsidiary Ola Electric has already filed draft IPO papers with SEBI and aims to raise Rs 5,500 crore through issuance of new shares.","The Bengaluru-based firm’s CEO Hemant Bakshi quit from his position within three months of joining the company.

Save lakhs in interest cost? What RBI’s new rules for interest overcharging on loans mean for borrowers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/save-lakhs-in-interest-cost-what-rbis-new-rules-for-interest-overcharging-on-loans-mean-for-borrowers/articleshow/109720536.cms,"What unfair practices have been highlighted by the RBI?

According to the RBI notification, following are some of the unfair practices that have been observed:

Charging of interest from the date of sanction of loan or date of execution of loan agreement and not from the date of actual disbursement of the funds to the customer. Similarly, in the case of loans being disbursed by cheque, instances were observed where interest was charged from the date of the cheque whereas the cheque was handed over to the customer several days later. In the case of disbursal or repayment of loans during the course of the month, some Regulated Entities were charging interest for the entire month, rather than charging interest only for the period for which the loan was outstanding. In some cases, it was observed that Regulated Entities were collecting one or more installments in advance but reckoning the full loan amount for charging interest.

What action has RBI taken?

What does RBI’s notification mean for consumers?

Suppose a borrower has been sanctioned a home loan of Rs 50 lakhs at an interest rate of 8.5% per annum for a tenure of 30 years. However, due to various administrative processes, the actual disbursement of the loan takes three months from the date of sanction.

If the lender charges interest from the date of sanction, the borrower would be liable to pay interest on the entire sanctioned amount of Rs 50 lakhs for the three-month period, even though they haven't received the funds yet.

Let's do the math:

Loan amount: Rs 50,00,000

Interest rate: 8.5% per annum

Tenure: 30 years

Interest for 3 months = Rs 1,15,338.

Has your lender been overcharging you interest for loans? The Reserve Bank of India has come across instances of lenders resorting to certain unfair practices in charging of interest. The same has been flagged by the central bank in a new notification dated April 29, 2024.RBI’s latest notification comes as a relief for loan borrowers, who have been fleeced by lenders who unfairly levied interest charges .The RBI has asked such practices to be discontinued and a refund to be provided by banks and NBFCs for excess interest collected. One such unfair practice is the calculation of interest from the date of loan execution rather than actual disbursement.What do RBI’s latest guidelines and instructions to banks and NBFCs mean for loan borrowers? We explain the math and answer your common questions:According to the RBI notification, these and other such non-standard practices of charging interest are not in consonance with the spirit of fairness and transparency while dealing with customers. “Wherever such practices have come to light, RBI through its supervisory teams has advised REs to refund such excess interest and other charges to customers. REs are also being encouraged to use online account transfers in lieu of cheques being issued in a few cases for loan disbursal,” the central bank has said.Also Read | Mutual Fund KYC issues: What problems are MF investors facing with new rules and how they can check their KYC status Adhil Shetty, the CEO of Bankbazaar.com told TOI, “The current RBI administration has been systematically pushing for greater transparency around loan charges. The latest notification is a step in the same direction. The central bank has called out what it has termed unfair practices by lenders, such as charging interest on loans from the date of sanction instead of the date of disbursal.""“The notification highlights that loan disbursal through cheques is a way through which there can be a gap between sanction and disbursal, thus increasing the interest burden on customers. This notification is positive for customers who can expect to trim their interest outflows,” he said.Atul Monga, CEO and Co-Founder, BASIC Home loan explains, “Charging interest from the date of loan sanction rather than from the date of actual disbursement can indeed impose additional financial burden on borrowers, particularly in the case of home loans where there might be a significant time gap between sanction and disbursement.”Monga elaborates with an example:So, the borrower would end up paying Rs 1,15,338 as additional interest for the three-month period if interest is charged from the date of sanction, Monga tells TOI.Also Read | Credit limit, billing cycle and 10 other important credit card terms you must know He adds that it is imperative for lenders to adhere to fair lending practices norms and charge interest from the date of actual disbursement rather than from the date of loan sanction, to ensure transparency and fairness in lending practices, especially in scenarios like home loans where substantial amounts are involved.Similarly, to recover interest on the full loan amount, even when some installments have been taken in advance, increases the loan burden on the borrower, and is an unfair practice since the borrower is overcharged since he pays interest on loan amount not received or utilized. To take an example, if a customer takes a loan for Rs 20,000 and repayment requires 12 EMIs, but the lender takes two advance installments of Rs 4,000. Even though an individual has received only Rs 16,000 in loan, he ends up paying interest on the entire Rs 20,000 loan amount.",The Reserve Bank of India has flagged instances of lenders resorting to certain unfair practices in charging of interest. One such unfair practice is the calculation of interest from the date of loan execution rather than actual disbursement.

Incomplete KYC: 1.3 crore investor accounts on hold,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/incomplete-kyc-1-3-crore-investor-accounts-on-hold/articleshow/109738398.cms,"MUMBAI: KYC registration entities, KRAs in market parlance, on Tuesday said out of nearly 11 crore investors under Sebi’s regulatory purview, about 1.3 crore accounts are ‘on hold’ (meaning these investors can’t transact in stocks, MFs and commodities using these KYCs) since these do not conform to Sebi rules for various reasons. The five KRAs jointly came out with a detailed release as there were cases where investors were not sure if their KYCs, even if done properly, would allow them to continue to invest in stocks, commodities and MFs.The need to reclassify KYCs under various categories arose after it was found that KYCs of many investors were still not updated with PAN and Aadhar, and the linkages were missing.Several of these KYCs were done using documents like utility bills (electricity, telephone), bank account statements etc, which are no longer accepted as valid documents for KYC compliance by Sebi.Effective April 1, under the updated KYC compliance process, KRAs have categorised each investor’s KYC in three categories: validated, registered and on hold. The categorisation was based on availability of PAN, Aadhaar, email and mobile number of the investors, an official from a KRA said.Investors with validated KYCs don’t need to act and can continue their investment process. Those with registered KYCs can also continue their investments but will need to resort to the re-KYC process if they invest in any new fund house or open a new demat account.KYCs that were done using bank statements, utility bills and other similar documents are on hold now and investors with these KYCs can’t invest anymore. They would also not be allowed to withdraw funds unless they update KYC documents.Of nearly 11 crore investors, about 7.9 crore or 73% have valid KYC, a release from the KRAs said. KYCs of about 1.6 crore investors are under the registered category, who now have limited access to investing, while 12% of the total can’t operate their demat accounts and MF folios.“Investors can verify their KYC status through any of the KRA websites under ‘KYC inquiry and initiate action,” the release said. Investors can also modify their KYCs through the websites of their brokers and MFs. And if the KYC is modified once, that will reflect on all their investments like stocks, MFs and commodities. Investors need not update their KYC with each broker and fund house they have accounts or folios with.","About 1.3 crore accounts are ‘on hold’ (meaning these investors can’t transact in stocks, MFs and commodities using these KYCs) The need to reclassify KYCs under various categories arose after it was found that KYCs of many investors were still not updated with PAN and Aadhar.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109738404,imgsize-588853,width-400,resizemode-4/109738404.jpg"
Industry’s share in bank credit shrinks to 23%: RBI,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/industrys-share-in-bank-credit-shrinks-to-23-rbi/articleshow/109738516.cms,"MUMBAI: Bank loans to the services and agriculture sectors were the main drivers of the 20% credit growth in FY24, with both sectors growing at over 20%, according to data released by RBI . While the pace of credit growth to large industries more than doubled in FY24 (7%) from the year before (3.1%), it remained sluggish, resulting in a further decline in market share.As of March 22, 2024, the share of industry in bank credit shrunk to 23.1% from 24.8% in March 2023 and 27.1% in March 2022.The share of the services sector has increased marginally to 28.3%. Personal loans now account for 31% of bank credit, up from 30.6% in March 2023 and 29% in March 2022.Banks added Rs 27.6 lakh crore to non-food credit in FY24, expanding their book by 20% to Rs 164.1 lakh crore. The exceptional growth was due to the merger of HDFC with HDFC Bank, which added Rs 5.3 lakh crore to bank loans or nearly 400 basis points to credit growth. Without the merger, the credit growth would have been 16.3%.Of the Rs 22.4 lakh crore that banks added to their books, around Rs 3 lakh crore went to industry. Within this, more than half of the incremental credit (Rs 1.7 lakh crore) went to large industry . Credit to the services sector (excluding the HDFC-HDFC Bank merger ) grew 20.2% to Rs 44.9 lakh crore, while personal loan growth (excluding HDFC merger impact) moderated to 17.7%. Total personal loans outstanding as of March 22, 2024 were Rs 49.2 lakh crore.Within services, the highest credit growth was recorded by the aviation sector, which grew 56% to Rs 43,246 crore. The ‘tourism, hotels and restaurant’ segment saw the biggest turnaround, with credit growth rising from 2.4% to 12% to Rs 77,642 crore.According to Madan Sabnavis, an economist with the Bank of Baroda , the higher capital norms imposed by RBI on unsecured and NBFC loans did help to slow down the credit growth rates to 15.3% from 29.9% for this segment.The growth rate of personal loans decelerated to 17.7%, compared to 21% recorded in the previous year. This decline was primarily attributed to a significant slowdown in ‘other personal loans’ to 18.7% and vehicle loans at 17.3%. However, home loans sustained their growth momentum, reaching 17.4% compared to 15.2% in the preceding year. Although the growth rate of credit cards moderated, it remained relatively high at 25.6%. Conversely, education loans experienced an uptick, with a growth rate of 23.3% in FY24.Within the industry, the sector that saw the biggest accretion to the loan book (in absolute amount) was infrastructure, which saw loans grow by 6.5% (Rs 77,653 crore) to Rs 12.8 lakh crore, followed by iron & steel (Rs 43,362 crore). Within infrastructure, banks grew their telecom loan book by 27% (Rs 29,954 crore) to Rs 1.4 lakh crore.

Binance crypto founder Changpeng Zhao sentenced to four months in prison,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/cryptocurrency/bitcoin/binance-crypto-founder-changpeng-zhao-sentenced-to-four-months-in-prison/articleshow/109742453.cms,"‘Unprecedented’

Regulatory ‘Oops’

Terrorist groups

Binance founder Changpeng Zhao was ordered to spend four months in prison for failures that allowed cybercriminals and terrorist groups to freely trade on the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange .Zhao, 47, was sentenced Tuesday by US District Judge Richard Jones in Seattle. Dressed in a dark suit with a light blue tie, the billionaire arrived in court flanked by half a dozen lawyers.His mother and sister watched his sentencing from the front row of the courtroom.The sentence was far below the three years requested by prosecutors, who had sought to make an example out of Zhao to a heavily-scrutinized industry rebounding from a slew of high-profile scandals. It is the first time a chief executive officer has ever gone to jail for a bank secrecy act violation, a charge that has been used repeatedly in crypto prosecutions in recent years.In imposing the sentence, Jones said he hoped Zhao understood that, despite “wealth, power and status,” no person is immune from prosecution or above the law. Zhao, who didn’t visibly react to the sentence, is expected to serve his four-month stint at Seattle’s Federal Detention Center, SeaTac. A date for Zhao to turn himself in to prison authorities has not been decided, although he has expressed eagerness to get back to his family in the United Arab Emirates.The sentence wraps up a yearslong probe by the Justice Department that cast a shadow over Binance and the man known as ‘CZ’, one of the industry’s most recognizable figures. The case also comes off the back of the 25-year prison sentence handed to Sam Bankman-Fried, a former crypto titan who stole billions of dollars from FTX customers.Zhao’s lawyers said he couldn’t serve time in a minimum-security facility, where most white collar defendants end up, because he wasn’t a US citizen. That put him at a greater risk than other inmates, his lawyers argued as they implored Jones to spare him from prison.Zhao’s attorneys pointed to cases involving similar banking law violations that resulted in probation, like the prosecution of crypto platform BitMEX executives. But Jones said this particular crime was “unprecedented” as it involved millions of dollars and led to illicit actors, including terrorists and hackers, moving funds across Binance.Zhao pleaded guilty in November for failing to implement an adequate money laundering program at Binance, an exchange that began in Shanghai in 2017 and ballooned to process trillions of dollars worth of trades each year. At the same time, Binance pleaded guilty to anti-money laundering and sanctions law violations and agreed to pay $4.3 billion to resolve investigations with the Justice Department and other US regulators.Zhao, who moved from China to Canada at age 12 and later settled in Dubai, has been barred from leaving the US since then. Addressing the judge on Tuesday, he expressed remorse and said he had traveled to Seattle last November to plead guilty instead of staying at his home in the UAE, which doesn’t have an extradition treaty with the US.“I left my family to come to the US to take responsibility for my actions,” Zhao said. “That’s because responsibility is a core value for me, and I live by that.” He described a life outside of crypto next, focusing on a philanthropic education project.While federal sentencing guidelines called for a punishment up to 18 months in prison, the US government pushed for more. Federal prosecutor Kevin Mosley said the Binance founder’s violations of US law were intentional, not an oversight.“This wasn’t a mistake,” Mosley said. “It wasn’t a regulatory ‘oops.’” But he also said the sentence the US sought was proportionate. Mosley said the government wasn’t suggesting Zhao’s crimes were comparable to Bankman-Fried and also wasn’t “trying to kill the crypto industry.”He zeroed in on a phrase Zhao used years prior: “It’s better to ask for forgiveness than permission.”By not asking for permission, Mosley argued, Zhao made his company great and rose to fame, becoming a crypto celebrity while sidestepping US compliance laws. The failure to maintain an adequate money laundering program opened the door to illicit actors, including crypto mixers, hackers and terrorist groups including al-Qaeda and ISIS, to trade Bitcoin on the platform.In an example detailed by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN, the al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas, used Bitcoin transactions to raise money for the Palestinian resistance. Hamas, which has been designated by the US as a terrorist organization, murdered more than 1,200 Israelis on Oct. 7.The lack of proper compliance led to some customers trading with residents of Iran in contravention of US sanctions. Between 2018 and 2022, Binance processed at least 1.1 million transactions that violated U.S sanctions, worth about $898 million, according to the government’s memo.While Zhao stepped down as CEO as part of his plea deal with the government, he continued to own the company and will “profit handsomely,” Mosley said, arguing that a fine alone was insufficient.The judge said he was also troubled by the ‘better to ask for forgiveness than permission’ statement, pointing to the irony of Zhao now coming before him to ask for forgiveness.Zhao’s lawyer Mark Bartlett said he couldn’t think of anything else a person could do to show their remorse.“Did he make mistakes? Absolutely, that’s why we are here,” Bartlett said.Some of that was financially motivated, he said, but Zhao got into crypto “to change the world.”Despite Zhao’s well-publicized criminal case, he has held onto his personal fortune. His wealth ballooned by $25 billion as the crypto industry recovered last year and he is currently ranked as the 42nd richest person in the world, according to Bloomberg Billionaires Index.","Binance founder Changpeng Zhao sentenced to four months in prison. Zhao pleaded guilty in November to failing to implement an adequate money laundering program. He is expected to serve his four-month stint at Seattle’s Federal Detention Center, SeaTac. The sentence was far below the three years requested by prosecutors.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109742455,imgsize-57838,width-400,resizemode-4/109742455.jpg"
Godrej family seals deal to split group’s assets,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/godrej-family-seals-deal-to-split-groups-assets/articleshow/109738329.cms,"MUMBAI: The Godrejs have reached a settlement to split the Rs 59,000-crore ($7 billion) locks-to-land development group to “better align ownership in acknowledgement of the differing visions of the family members”.While Adi Godrej and his brother Nadir Godrej will gain complete ownership over the five listed entities of the Godrej Group — Godrej Consumer Products, Godrej Properties, Godrej Industries , Godrej Agrovet and Astec Lifesciences — Jamshyd and his sister Smita will fully control the closely- held Godrej & Boyce.Adi and Nadir, together with their children, have been managing the five entities, while Jamshyd, his sister Smita and their families have been leading Godrej & Boyce, which is into appliances, aerospace, locking solutions and construction.Their other cousin Rishad, who too owns a stake in the Godrej companies, however, has no formal role in the conglomerate. Their grandfather, along with his brother, had established the Godrej Group 127 years ago.The two branches have held shares across the group and sat on each other’s companies’ boards. But now, they’ll transfer their equity interests after having stepped down from the boards to facilitate a clean separation.Adi and Nadir will divest their shares in Godrej & Boyce to Jamshyd and Smita, while Smita and Jamshyd will transfer their shares in Godrej Consumer Products and Godrej Properties to Adi and Nadir. Rishad, who is a bachelor, will reportedly distribute his assets equally among the other family members upon his death. He couldn’t be contacted for immediate comments. Both sides will continue to use the Godrej brand for their respective businesses, according to a late evening statement from the family.Adi, Nadir, Jamshyd, Smita and Rishad own around 10% each in Godrej & Boyce, while about 24% is held by Pirojsha Godrej Foundation — a philanthropic trust created by the family — and 27% by Godrej Investments. The five listed companies have a market capitalisation of Rs 2.4 lakh crore ($29 billion), revenues of over Rs 41,750 crore ($5 billion) and profit of Rs 4,175 crore ($500 million). Godrej & Boyce has a revenue of nearly $2 billion and a pre-tax profit of $72 million.“The shareholding realignment in Godrej companies has been arrived at in a respectful and mindful way to maintain harmony,” the statement said. The realignment will be implemented after the relevant regulatory approvals have been obtained.Godrej & Boyce and its affiliates will now be controlled by Jamshyd, Smita’s daughter Nyrika Holkar, and their immediate families. Godrej Industries and the other four listed companies will be controlled by Adi, Nadir and their immediate families.Adi’s son Pirojsha will be the executive vice chairperson of GIG (Godrej Industries Group) and will succeed Nadir Godrej as chairperson in August 2026, the statement added. It remains to be seen how the group’s real estate assets worth over Rs 3,000 crore, held under Godrej & Boyce, will be split between the two sides. Godrej Properties has been developing some of the Godrej & Boyce land. The split comes even as the fourth generation of the family has been deeply involved in the affairs of the conglomerate.Commenting on the future outlook, Jamshyd Godrej said: “Since 1897, Godrej & Boyce has always been driven by the strong purpose of nation building. With this future-facing family agreement now in place, we can further drive our growth aspirations with fewer complexities and focus on leveraging our core strengths in high tech engineering and design-led innovation across our strong portfolio of strategic, consumer and emerging businesses.”Nadir Godrej said, “Godrej was founded in 1897 to help build economic independence for India. This deep purpose of innovating for a cause - the values of trust and respect and the belief in trusteeship and making communities that the companies operate in stronger and better - continue to form the bedrock of who we are 125 years later. We look forward to building on this legacy with focus and agility.” “The Godrej family settlement was ‘locked’ today with the elegance and dignity that the family is known for. No controversies, just all clean like their soaps,” said a post from RPG Group’s Harsh Goenka on X.","The Godrejs have reached a settlement to split the Rs 59,000-crore ($7 billion) locks-to-land development group.

Nearly 5 lakh women employed in Indian GCCs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/nearly-5-lakh-women-employed-in-indian-gccs/articleshow/109738561.cms,"BENGALURU: Indian global capability centres (GCCs) have made significant strides in gender diversity, with nearly five lakh women currently employed in the sector. This represents 28% of the total 16 lakh employees working in GCCs across India, as shown in the Pure Storage and Zinnov report titled “Towards a Gender Equitable World”. Within the deep tech ecosystem, gender diversity stands at 23%.Despite this positive development, it highlights the substantial ground that still needs to be covered to bridge the diversity gap in the industry. With only 6.7% of women in executive roles in GCCs and 5.1% in deep tech organisations, there is a considerable decrease in the available talent pool of women as they move up the career ladder. In GCCs, at the senior level (9-12 years of experience), the representation stands at 15.7%, the report said.India has nearly 1,600 GCCs. In 2022-23, GCCs added 2.8 lakh employees, taking its talent base to over 1.6 million. The report stated that family and caregiving responsibilities, limited access to career advancement and opportunities, and poor work-life balance are some factors influencing women’s attrition.“While India proudly leads in the number of women STEM graduates globally, their under-representation in the deep tech workforce stems from systemic barriers hindering their education and career advancement. To unlock the full potential of our talent pool, we need to take a comprehensive approach, including strategic actions to increase the enrolment of women in leading technological institutions and retaining them in the workforce,” said Ajeya Motaganahalli, VP of engineering and MD, India R&D at Pure Storage.The median representation of women graduates from top engineering universities stands at 25% between 2020-23, which directly affects the inflow of female candidates in GCCs, especially in the deep tech sector. Despite this disparity in women’s representation, women graduates consistently outperformed in securing placements compared to the overall average in top-tier universities.“Advancement in any industry is stagnant without equity. While deep tech has pushed the boundaries of possibility, the sobering truth is that the sector has only 5.1% women at the executive level. Interventions to solve the talent pipeline issue and create work environments enabling women to thrive have become an urgent necessity,” said Karthik Padmanabhan, managing partner at tech advisory firm Zinnov.","India has nearly 1,600 GCCs.

The finance minister set the stage for a ""Viksit Bharat by 2047"", on the core principles of ‘Sabka Saath’, ‘Sabka Vikas’, ‘Sabka Vishwas’, with ‘Sabka Prayas’ being added as a new theme in the interim Budget.This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data i.e., farmer welfare and N for Nari utthan i.e., support for women entrepreneurs.These form the pillars of a comprehensive inclusive development. The Government's commitment to sustainable development under the strategy for Amrit Kaal includes achieving 'Net Zero' by 2070, rooftop solarization for one crore households and robust health initiatives.The Indian economy's resilience takes center stage amidst positive indicators of declining current account deficit as a percentage of GDP, falling unemployment rates, and a notable rise in digital transactions. These statistics affirm the robustness of the economy, showcasing a trajectory of growth and stability.The achievements in taxation reforms are nothing short of remarkable, with direct tax collections more than trebling in the last decade, the number of tax return filers increasing by 2.4 times, average processing time of tax returns plummeting from 93 days in FY 2013-14 to an impressive 10 days in FY 2023-24, resulting in issuance of quick refunds. These are the results of consistent progressive measures thus obviating the need for, and rightly avoiding, any last-minute populist measures.No change in existing tax rates, both for direct and indirect taxes, is a good indicator of stability and predictability for investors and taxpayers.A welcome move to waive outstanding tax demands that are minor, disputed, and unreconciled. This involves the withdrawal of outstanding direct tax demands up to Rs. 25,000 pertaining to the period up to FY 2009-10 and up to Rs.10,000 for FY 2010-11 to 2014-15.The Government's commitment to fostering a business-friendly environment is evident in its intent to extend specific tax benefits for start-ups, investments by sovereign wealth funds/ pension funds, and certain IFSC units. The extension has been made now until March 31, 2025. This might help in creating a conducive landscape for business.To align with the CBDT notification issued earlier, the provisions relating to tax collection at source concerning remittances under the Liberalized Remittance Scheme have now been formally incorporated in the Finance Bill, 2024, setting the rate at 20% for amounts exceeding Rs. 7 lakhs in a financial year.The Finance Bill, 2024 proposes an extension of the time limit for introducing the faceless scheme by the Central Government for transfer pricing proceedings, DRP Proceedings, and ITAT Proceedings, up to March 31, 2025.The interim Budget 2024 may not have proposed significant tax announcements, but it very well positioned the prelude to the full budget post the upcoming elections. Considering the potential impact on the population across the four pillars of GYAN, a sizable portion of India stands to be covered. The interim Budget’s focus on the tax front resembles a report card, highlighting the maturity achieved by our tax system. The enhancement of taxpayer services was emphasized as a key priority.","This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data and N for Nari utthan.

Interim Budget for a Viksit Bharat: It’s for everyone and all,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/interim-budget-for-a-viksit-bharat-its-for-everyone-and-all/articleshow/107497439.cms,"By Akhilesh Tuteja

The Finance Minister on February 01, 2024, delivered a truly innovative interim budget. At first glance, it did not seem like an interim budget but looked more like the budget to drive further growth and a continuum of inclusive growth-oriented investments.At the outset, this budget brings a wonderful balance between fiscal prudence and continued investment for growth.It's not easy to continue the glide path of reducing the fiscal deficit and continuing to make significant investments in all areas including infrastructure, R&D, energy transition, technology, skilling, and social welfare. The surprising reduction in fiscal deficit of 5.8% as against the budgeted 5.9% for FY24 and the projection of 5.1% in FY25 with a clear focus on increasing investments was a huge positive.This was a budget for everyone and all because it caters to every part of the Indian economy and society. The FM has carefully catered to the investment needs of various sectors. The continued focus on youth, impoverished, women and farmers to increase their involvement and contribution to economic growth is evident. By committing an 11.1% increase in capital expenditure to 11,11,111 lakh crore, the FM has clearly brought every single 1 in this growth journey.What was very impressive was the inclusion strategy of the government. The focus on women's empowerment for the past few years is unprecedented, which is reflected in the inclusion of women in the workforce moving from 23.3% to 37% in the last five years. The thirty crore Mudra Yojna loans to women entrepreneurs were a great boost to the Nari Shakti initiative. We already have over 10 million Lakhpati Didis and what is truly evident is like a corporate CFO, the FM has revised the earlier target of 20 million Lakhpati Didis to 30 million. The government also plans to invest in initiatives to encourage young girls between the ages of 9 and 14 to undertake the vaccination for cervical cancer which is again a great boost to Nari Shakti.A lot needs to be done to bring more women into all parts of economic growth but the journey so far and the vision of the future is truly inspiring.While India continues on its technological prowess and makes its mark in new technologies like Artificial Intelligence, we need a multi-pronged strategy to harness the power of AI. We need a clear focus on building AI systems in India so that we not only emerge as a global leader in this new era but can build models, which are specific to India that will benefit Indians. At the same time, we need a very wide coverage program to build skills to leverage AI to its fullest potential. The biggest contribution we can make to the inclusion of youth in the economic development of the country is by skilling them in new skill areas. In the last few years, the Skill India Mission has trained 14 million youth, reskilled over 5 million youth and established a staggering 3,000 new ITIs. The future of any country will depend as much on capital investments as on skill investments.The focus on agricultural development and support to the farmer continues through direct financial assistance to farmers. The farmers have benefited by getting crop insurance through PM Fasal Bima Yojana. It's not just the farmers, the PM-SVANidhi provides credit assistance to a large number of street vendors.The last few years have seen the journey of affordable housing through Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY). There is a slight increase in allocation to launch a scheme for encouraging the middle class to build or buy new homes. This investment will likely propel a wider economic development and increase employment.India has seen a tremendous rise in entrepreneurship in the last few years. In order to continue the journey and promote new startups, the government proposes to extend certain tax benefits, which are expiring from March 2024 to March 2025. The MSMEs have not been left behind. With a proposal to provide timely finances to such enterprises, the government has paved the way for their growth, so they can look to compete globally.All in all, it’s a truly inclusive budget with a clear focus on development not just by giving away freebies but enabling the people to participate in the economic development activity. While the FM calls the comprehensive GDP - Governance, Development & Performance – to me, this budget is inclusive of another GDP – gender, demography, and professions.","Akhilesh Tuteja is Partner and Head, Clients and Markets, KPMG in India.

‘Enough domestic sources of demand to counter drag from external sector’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/enough-domestic-sources-of-demand-to-counter-drag-from-external-sector/articleshow/107372012.cms,"Do you think the

creates room for lower interest rates?

One of the issues that the Budget has flagged is the demographic challenge and opportunity and the societal change that is taking place. How do you view this?

Niti Aayog is working on the Viksit Bharat roadmap. What will be the focus areas?

You are as much a representative of the Centre as well as the states. Is it time to revisit the entire formula for transfers to states particularly on the issue of cesses and surcharges?

Suman Bery , who heads Niti Aayog , the govt think tank, is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China, which he says is also an opportunity for India. The economist is confident that Indian states remain resilient. Excerpts of the interview with TOI.The finance ministry expects the economy to grow 7% next year.Given the global situation, how do you see the prospects?The belief in the finance ministry is that we have a possible drag coming from the external sector but that we have other sources. We have enough domestic sources of demand. One has to applaud the political and economic judgment of FM in deciding that it was appropriate to pursue the path of fiscal consolidation. There is transparency. What this actually reflects is responsible economic management, which is one reason we are where we are. Second, it also creates a buffer so that there is policy space if we do encounter headwinds.That’s the hope and expectation. We have an independent central bank and an inflation targeting central bank, so it is up to the monetary policy committee to take a call through the monetary policy committee on the repo rate .The PM has said that when India grows its states grow. India is a composite of 37 states and UTs. They are each at very different points in their demographic transition. There are some states where the net replacement rate is down to 1%, like Kerala . There are others, particularly UP and Bihar, which are in their earliest stage of demographic transition and each one of these states is the size of a large European country. There are two implications of that — one is internal labour mobility and it will become an even larger part of our growth model. The govt has taken several steps to create a unified market. Our main endowment is our human capital and that has to be equipped to participate in global exchange in many ways. We know from China, Japan that the demographic dividend partly depends on markets and on human capital. But the golden period is fairly short lived, about 15 years, when the so called dependency ratio declines. The other big opportunity the PM has been highlighting is bringing women much more into the active labour force.When Niti was set up there was the idea of a three-year vision and a seven-year strategy paper. The reality is that schemes of govt tend to be aligned with the award of the Finance Commission . There are various established building blocks or hand holds which are already a matter of govt policy. The PM is much more interested in a national debate on what it means to be a Viksit Bharat or modern society. We have a collective goal and it is for the democratic polity to define what that goal should be. Its emphatically not for a super mandarin bureaucracy. It is not going to be Lee Kwan Yew’s Singapore led from the top.It’s entirely a finance ministry matter but I would be lying if I didn’t say when I visit certain states there is this complaint. A big frontier would be resource mobilisation at the state level. Second is going to be rationalisation of subsidies not only at the Union level, but also at the state level. All chief ministers sit on my governing council. When they convene as the governing council, I see them in their role as development practitioners. The world is beginning to appreciate quite how much institutional and political maturity India attained in our 75 years and the most fundamental dimension of a democracy, we have orderly transfers of power. There are enough buffers to ensure that what happens in state finances is unlikely to create macro instability. Those risks are well contained by our Constitution. The chief ministers know that they are going to be judged by development outcomes and so you can have the sugar rush of changing of pension plans or various handouts but if the cupboard is bare you are not going to be able to deliver.","Suman Bery is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China.

Government's Marathon to 2047: Emphasis on Fiscal Prudence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/governments-marathon-to-2047-emphasis-on-fiscal-prudence/articleshow/107371788.cms,"What was the thinking behind keeping the vote on account absolutely straight?

So is it the idea to keep the Budget completely transparent?

The capex has risen 11.1% and there is an emphasis on infrastructure spending. But there is also the hope that the private sector will now take over and start capital spending. Given the geopolitical situation, how confident is the govt that it will pan out as planned?

Finance secretary T V Somanathan, in an interview with TOI, says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047 . Excerpts:If you see the Budget speech you will see the emphasis on 2047. The govt has set its sight on running that marathon.Running to 2047 is a marathon , it’s not a sprint. If you are going to run a marathon, you need to be in good shape and you can’t have short-term stimulants or something that will get you some yards and then it’s done.The whole focus is on making India a developed country by 2047, for which a healthy present and a strong fiscal position is an important concomitant. Some purely short term measures don’t really fit into that picture. It’s a consistent picture: focus on the long term for which you need to build strength in the short term and that needs to be done by prudence in fiscal policy and by not doing things which can detract you from that path. Not doing the wrong thing is more important than appearing to do things.The idea is that govt finances may be good, bad or indifferent depending on the times, depending on the circumstances, depending on the policies. But what is the position should be reflected as reasonably and accurately as possible. That is an emphasis. As regards the Finance Commission, again the terms of reference that have been given to them are the terms in the Constitution.What is the means by which the devolution should be done is a matter they have full discretion. They can actually take all kinds of factors into account and in a sense we felt this time based on my review of the previous commissions that the right expression would be less is more. The shorter, less prescriptive terms of reference gives full scope for all stakeholders including state govts to express their viewpoints and for the commission to take a balanced view of the different perspectives and then come to its award. Ultimately the award of the Finance Commission is about devolution and grant for which full scope has now been given to them.n There are incipient signs of private capital expenditure accelerating. There are some surveys I have seen done by some of the chambers industry, which show high levels of investment. The PMI, which is a sort of leading indicator, is also looking pretty healthy. Capacity utilisation is one reason that private sector capital expenditure doesn’t immediately pick up when the economy starts accelerating because there is surplus capacity.But increasingly I get the sense that many industries are beginning to reach levels where they have to add capacity. When that happens capital investment will happen. Another pointer also mentioned in the Budget speech you may notice that our airlines have placed large orders for planes — that is capital expenditure.When you import 1,000 aircraft, it’s just not 1,000 aircraft, there are concomitant additions to ground handling facilities, you need airports to expand, you need to employ people to do that. That means a lot of jobs. The aircraft is capital but then look at the effect it is going to have on skilled jobs. So capital expenditure is happening. I am fairly confident that we will have decent capital expenditure in the year to come and that will become a new source of acceleration.",Finance secretary T V Somanathan says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047.

The maximum limit for claiming tax benefits under Section 80C remains at Rs 1.5 lakh for the current fiscal year 2023-24 and will stay the same for individuals looking to save on taxes through Section 80C investments in the upcoming fiscal year 2024-25.Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions. Individuals can reduce their gross taxable income by up to Rs 1.5 lakh per financial year by engaging in these specific investments or expenditures.You can save on taxes through Section 80C by investing in things like Employees' Provident Fund (EPF), Public Provident Fund (PPF), Equity Linked Saving Scheme (ELSS) mutual funds, National Savings Certificate (NSC), and 5-year tax-saving fixed deposits with banks or post offices. Additionally, paying life insurance policy premiums also qualifies for tax benefits under Section 80C.It is important to note that each eligible investment comes with its specific maximum limit, rate of return, liquidity, and taxation rules for the earned returns, states ET in a report. For instance, the most you can invest in PPF in a financial year is Rs 1.5 lakh. Meanwhile, there's no limit on the amount you can invest in ELSS mutual funds, but the Section 80C deduction is capped at Rs 1.5 lakh.If individuals can't make specific investments, they can still get deductions under Section 80C from their gross taxable income through certain expenses. These expenses include repaying the principal amount of a home loan, tuition fees for children, payment of stamp duty, registration fees, and other costs related to buying a house.Since the financial year 2020-21, individuals without any business income must annually choose between the old and new tax regimes. As of the fiscal year 2023-24, the new tax regime is the default option. Consequently, individuals seeking tax deductions under Section 80C must opt for the old tax regime since this deduction isn't available in the new tax regime. It's crucial for taxpayers to be aware of these rules to make informed decisions about their tax planning and investment strategies.","Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions.

Budget 2024 focuses on youth and women entrepreneurship,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/budget-2024-focuses-on-youth-and-women-entrepreneurship/articleshow/107357923.cms,"By

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget which is an interim budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year. The budget talks about inclusive development both, social and geographical, especially for youth, women, farmers, and the poor. Continued focus on improving logistics through infrastructure spend on roads, rail, airports, ports increases productivity for companies and citizens alike.To make ‘Viksit Bharat’ by 2047, the government’s focus is on improving and empowering people’s capabilities through various skilling initiatives. It is encouraging to see that Skill India Mission has succeeded in training more than 1.4 crore youth and upskilling and reskilling 54 lakh youth. I am particularly happy to see the continued focus on youth and women entrepreneurship and the announcement of a new fund which will give interest free 50 year loans for startups will provide a domestic fillip to startups supplementing venture capital we have traditionally relied on from abroad.PM Mudra Yojana has sanctioned 43 crore loans aggregating to 22.5 lakh crore to youth entrepreneurs and thirty crore Mudra Yojana loans to women entrepreneurs. There are several other schemes like Fund of Funds, Start-Up India, and Start-Up Credit Guarantee schemes that are assisting our youth. Further, the extension of tax benefits to Start-ups and investments made by sovereign wealth funds/pension funds, till 31st March 2025 depicts the government’s effort to support the startup eco- system.This aligns quite well with India Sanitation Coalition’s efforts to give impetus to the start-up world. Over the past 7 editions of our ISC-FICCI Sanitation Awards, we have recognized and promoted several start-ups in the sanitation space, many of whom are successful businesses now!While the finance minister did not provide detailed information on Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH), the budget allocation sees a slight increase in spend demonstrating continued focus on this highly successful program. The acknowledgement that the private sector has increasingly played a substantial role in addressing WASH issues in both urban and rural areas, with numerous projects underway through Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs), highlights the government's commitment to addressing challenges in this sector.A perfect example is the LightHouse Initiative initiated by the Department of Drinking Water along with the India Sanitation Coalition (ISC) by partnering with major corporates across India to develop model villages in Solid and Liquid Waste Management (SLWM) under SBM-Grameen. From this budget, there is an expectation that the government will persist in prioritizing Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) as the path toward achieving the country's Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6). Additionally, it is hoped that the government will uphold its commitment to making necessary infrastructural investments for SLWM.The budget speech rightly celebrates the fact that we have 83 lakh SHGs and 9 crore women beneficiaries. The microfinance movement in the country and the possibility of empowering women members of SHGs through livelihood skilling is a key to bringing women into mainstream economic advancement.The focus on green growth, rooftop solar, wind, biomass, e-vehicles all help with our green energy thrust. The tourism sector was mentioned and could be a huge job provider for youth and women.Guided by the principle ‘Reform, Perform, and Transform’, the budget emphasizes efficient implementation of various policies by improving coordination with states and relevant stakeholders. This is critical both for infra spend and social programsIt is noteworthy that ISC’s Climate Resilient Coastal Cities project which is being implemented in PPP (Public-Private Partnership) mode in four coastal states of Karnataka, Gujarat, Goa and Maharashtra is congruent with the government’s priority of promoting climate-resilient activities for the blue economy 2.0, a scheme for restoration and adaptation measures, and coastal aquaculture.The budget also focuses on the Aspirational districts program where assistance will be given to the states for faster development of aspirational districts and blocks, including the generation of ample economic opportunities. This is again very crucial as it has a huge potential to transform the landscape of our country while making sure no -one is left behind.Overall, this budget has embraced economic strategies and develops the building blocks that nurture and uphold growth, promote inclusive and sustainable development, and enhance productivity.","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year.

India fumes at Trudeau taking part in pro-Khalistan event,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-fumes-at-trudeau-taking-part-in-pro-khalistan-event/articleshow/109708322.cms,"Trudeau seen smiling at pro-Khalistan rally

NEW DELHI: Ministry of external affairs summoned the Canadian deputy high commissioner on Monday and strongly protested the unabashed chanting of separatist pro-Khalistan slogans at an event addressed by Canadian PM Justin Trudeau .Trudeau addressing a ‘ Khalsa Day ’ gathering in Toronto, which flaunted ‘Modi wanted’ banners, has left the Indian intelligence establishment alarmed, sources said.The banners were allegedly put up by secessionist group Sikhs For Justice (SFJ), which has called for the killing of terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar in June last year to be avenged, and has incited violence against Indian diplomats in Canada .Addressing the event, Trudeau vowed to protect the rights and freedoms of Sikhs. India has in the past blamed Trudeau’s “vote-bank politics” for Canada’s reluctance to rein in pro-Khalistan leaders who continue to target Indian interests in the country.A huge banner at the event identified PM Narendra Modi, defence minister Rajnath Singh and external affairs minister S Jaishankar as “Nijjar’s killers”.Trudeau pushed bilateral ties into a downward spiral by saying Canadian law enforcement had uncovered a “plot” by India to eliminate Nijjar, wanted for terrorist crimes and who has been blamed for the killing of a Sikh for taking control of a rich gurdwara.Trudeau, who also raised his allegation with Modi, is yet to back the claim he made in public that Royal Canadian Mounted Police and Canadian Security Intelligence Agency had got evidence of India’s hand in Nijjar’s killing and had identified those who pulled the trigger.Also, while he said that he had got the evidence from a fellow member of Five Eyes Alliance, an Anglosphere intelligence group comprising US, UK, New Zealand and Australia, other members of the grouping have not allowed the episode to cast a shadow on their ties with New Delhi.The latest incident triggered an angry protest from MEA which conveyed govt’s “deep concern and strong protest” as disturbing actions were being allowed to continue unchecked at the event.The govt said the unchecked separatist activity once again illustrated the political space that has been given in Canada to separatism, extremism and violence. “Their continued expressions not only impact India-Canada relations but also encourage a climate of violence and criminality in Canada to the detriment of its own citizens,” it added.During Trudeau’s address, pro-Khalistan Sikhs demanded the prosecution of Indian high commissioner Sanjay Verma for “orchestrating the assassination of Hardeep Singh Nijjar”. In a video released by SFJ, Trudeau was seen smiling at the chants of “Khalistan zindabad”.SFJ chief Pannun said, “Trudeau’s address is reassuring that pro-Khalistan Sikhs’ right to campaign for liberation of Punjab from Indian occupation was protected under Canadian Charter of Rights and the liberal govt will always stand with Canadian Sikhs.”","The banners were allegedly put up by secessionist group Sikhs For Justice (SFJ), which has called for the killing of terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar in June last year to be avenged.

Defense counsel gets time to file counter documents

MADURAI: Six years after a damning audio clip where she was heard luring college girls to do sexual favours for ‘senior officers’, Nirmala Devi, who was assistant professor then, was found guilty of the offence and convicted by Srivilliputhur mahila court on Monday. The court will pronounce the quantum of sentence on Tuesday.Judge T Bagavathiammal, however, acquitted two other accused — V Murugan, assistant professor at Madurai Kamaraj University, and S Karuppasamy, a research scholar, for lack of evidence.Nirmala Devi was arrested on April 16, 2018. Nirmala Devi, an assistant professor at Devanga Arts College in Aruppukottai in Virudhunagar district, affiliated with Madurai Kamaraj University (MKU), was arrested on Apr 16, 2018.She was arrested after an audio clip of her telephonic conversation with girl students in which she purportedly suggested them to do ‘favours’ for senior officials, went viral on social media. State govt transferred the case to CB-CID on April 17, 2018, and Murugan was arrested on April 24.Karuppasamy surrendered at Madurai district court on April 25. CB-CID booked the three under IPC sections 370 (1) and (3) for bid to traffic persons, 120 (b) for criminal conspiracy and provisions of immoral trafficking and IT Act and Tamil Nadu Prohibition Harassment of Women Act. After completing the investigation, CB-CID filed the charge sheet before they were given bail after almost one year. During trial, the CB-CID filed 1,360 pages of chargesheet and the court heard the testimonies of 104 people, including the affected girl students, their parents, college authorities, MKU officials and teaching staff.On Friday, judge T Bagavathiammal was constrained to adjourn the case to Monday, as Nirmala Devi did not appear before the court when it was scheduled to pronounce the judgment. On Monday, the judge held Nirmala Devi guilty and convicted her while acquitting Murugan and Karuppsamy citing lack of evidence. All three accused were present in the court with their counsel.Though initially the judge said the quantum of punishment would be announced on Monday evening, counsel representing Nirmala Devi requested the judge two days’ time to present a few more documents. However, the public prosecutor objected to it, and requested the judge to pronounce the quantum of punishment. Judge Bagavathiammal, accepting the argument of the defence counsel, adjourned the sentence to Tuesday 2.30pm, by which time he could file the documents to the court.","Nirmala Devi, an assistant professor at Devanga Arts College in Aruppukottai in Virudhunagar district, affiliated with Madurai Kamaraj University (MKU), was arrested on April 16, 2018.

In fact, several of them, who had got initial funding or got support from business incubators may find themselves at a loose end.From April 30, Canada has capped the number of permanent residence applications that will be accepted for processing each year, to those associated with no more than 10 startups per designated organisation.According to a release issued by the Immigration Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC), the reason behind this move is to reduce the backlog and improve processing times of the applications filed.Put simply, currently there are approximately 82 such designated organisations comprising venture capital funds (VCFs), angel investors and business incubators. Thus, it means that not more than 820 applications will be accepted (assuming that the number of such organisations remains constant).In addition, the announcement states that priority processing will be available for entrepreneurs whose start-up is supported by Canadian capital or by a business incubator that is a member of Canada’s Tech Network.The startup visa (SUV) program offers a clear path to permanent residence and does not require the entrepreneur-applicants to invest any of their funds or have a minimum net worth, but they need to show adequate funds to support themselves and their family on arrival in Canada. Support from one or more of the designated partners, viz: venture capital funds (VCF), angel investor groups (who need to invest at least Canadian dollars (CAD) 200,00 and 75,000 respectively) or acceptance into a program by a business incubator is a must.The immigration level targets under this program were set at 5,000 for the current year and 6,000 for 2025 and 2026. Josh Schachnow, an immigration lawyer and founder of a tech fir, points out, “But now they're being reduced to basically nothing (with less than 100 designated entities, it means less than 1,000 applications through SUV for the entire year).”Many in the entrepreneur-funding sector and immigration experts, view this to be a bad move. In 2023, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) had ranked Canada as the most attractive destination for startup founders. Since the program began in 2013, about 900 entrepreneurs have become permanent residents through this category, representing the launch of more than 300 start-ups. Incidentally, the US does not have a specific visa with a pathway to citizenship for immigrant entrepreneurs.In addition, Canada’s immigration minister, Marc Miller announced a full pause on application intake for the Self-­Employed Persons Program to focus on processing applications from the inventory, starting April 30, 2024. The Self-Employed Persons Program provides a pathway to permanent residence for people with notable experience in art, culture, recreation or sports and who will contribute to Canada’s cultural vitality. Due to the high number of applications submitted for this program, processing times have increased to beyond four years. While the pause is in place, IRCC will continue finalizing applications from the backlog while assessing options for reforming the program and ensuring its integrity, states a release.","From April 30, Canada has capped the number of permanent residence applications that will be accepted for processing each year.

With their growth potential, meme coins have been shaking things up in the digital currency sector. Traders put their money into meme coins rather than gold as gold prices reach all-time highs. Today, we will discuss five of the popular meme coins that have piqued interest: KangaMoon (KANG), Floki (FLOKI), Bonk (BONK), Dogwifhat (WIF) and Shiba Inu (SHIB).First on our meme coins to watch list is KangaMoon (KANG) - a shining presale star that many traders gravitate toward as gold prices rise.This presale project has already obtained over $5.8M and may reach $6M before April 2024 ends. Moreover, over 20,000 people are registered community members, and 6,000 are KANG holders.This number is projected to increase as KangaMoon recently announced a significant partnership with RaidSharks. With this development, KangaMoon will introduce thrilling raids with an outstanding $1,000 monthly reward pool.Unlike most meme coins, KANG will have actual utility. It will be the main in-game currency for KangaMoon’s upcoming P2E game, allowing you to buy in-game items and upgrade your characters. Moreover, KangaMoon is now giving its most active community members free KANG tokens before its official launch, which is an excellent way to give back to its community.In Stage 5 of its presale, one KANG costs only $0.0196 - a 290% ROI for those who bought it early on. Market analysts predict another 100x jump once a Tier-1 CEX lists this meme coin in Q2 of 2024. This price prediction could come true thanks to its connections to the resilient P2E market, which may reach $885M by 2028. Thus, KANG is one of the best meme coins to invest in now.Next, we must discuss Floki (FLOKI) trading in the green. CoinMarketCap data shows that the Floki price soared from $0.00013 to $0.00019 over the last seven days, and its market cap increased from $1.30B to $1.90B in that time. Crypto analyst Captain Faibik predicts Floki will soon see a 2x or 3x bullish rally.The technical analysis for this meme coin supports this prediction. For example, the Floki coin is now trading above its 50—and 100-day EMAs. Not only that, but Floki boasts 26 technical indicators in the buy zone. Therefore, experts in the crypto field predict a rise to $0.000287 for Floki within Q2 of 2024, making it one of the top meme coins to invest in as gold is soaring.Bonk (BONK) is another dominant force in the meme coin space . Over the last week, the Bonk price increased from $0.000014 to $0.000027, according to CoinMarketCap data. Its market cap surged from $905M to $1.78B during that period. The crypto analyst behind the More Crypto Online YouTube channel forecasts a jump to $0.00078 for this meme coin soon.Currently, the Bonk crypto is trading above its 21 and 50-day EMAs. In addition, over 24 technical indicators are showing green for Bonk. Thus, market analysts forecast a potential hike to $0.000039 for BONK before Q2 of 2024 ends.In second-to-last place on our meme coin list is Dogwifhat (WIF). According to CoinMarketCap data, the Dogwifhat price surged from $2.49 to $3.41 in the past seven days, and its market cap rose from $2.45B to $3.40B. With this trend continuing, Dogwifhat is another of the best meme coins to buy as the value of gold skyrockets.The technical analysis for the Dogwifhat crypto also shows bullish signals. For instance, there are now 19 technical indicators in the buy zone for Dogwifhat. Because of this, experts in the crypto field have made a bullish Dogwifhat price prediction. They forecast a surge to $4.53 within Q2 of 2024 for Dogwifhat.Last, we must mention Shiba Inu (SHIB) - one of the meme coin titans . The Shiba Inu price rose from $0.000021 to $0.000026 during the previous seven days. In that period, SHIB’s market cap surged from $12.76B to $15.76B.The Shiba Inu technical analysis has recently been under bull control. Notably, the Shiba Inu coin is now trading above its 100—and 200-day EMAs. Additionally, 28 technical indicators are flashing green for Shiba Inu. As a result, market analysts remain bullish for SHIB. They foresee a potential jump to $0.000040 for this meme coin before Q2 of 2024 finishes.Traders are looking towards meme coins for possible profits as the price of gold soars to record levels. Meme coins have risks and volatility but can yield massive returns if you’re open to digital assets. With rapid expansion, KangaMoon, Floki, Bonk, Dogwifhat and Shiba Inu could skyrocket.However, KangaMoon has a distinct advantage—a low market cap of $19.6M. In other words, KANG will need only $19.6M for its current price to double, which means faster growth than its rivals. With this advantage plus its utility, KANG emerges as one of the best meme coins to invest in now.

"IMF boosts Asia growth forecast this year on China, India",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/imf-boosts-asia-growth-forecast-this-year-on-china-india/articleshow/109709554.cms,"The International Monetary Fund boosted its growth forecast for Asia this year, reflecting a rosier outlook for the region’s two largest economies and flagging a possible upward revision in its outlook for China.Asia is set to expand 4.5% in 2024 from the prior year, 0.3 percentage points higher than the October regional outlook but a slowdown from last year’s 5% pace, according to the IMF report on Tuesday.The latest data has taken into account the higher forecast for India published earlier this month and China’s pace, on the back of expectations that government stimulus will boost growth. On China, the IMF said first-quarter growth came in stronger than expected on robust exports and manufacturing demand, which may prompt another upward revision.“Global disinflation and the prospect of lower central bank interest rates have made a soft landing more likely, hence risks to the near-term outlook are now broadly balanced,” Krishna Srinivasan , director of IMF’s Asia and Pacific department, wrote in a blog post.China’s central government has ramped up spending this year to support an economy still reeling from a weakened property sector and to propel growth to its target near 5% this year. In India, the government ramped up capital spending by a third for 2024, the third year in a row.China’s real gross domestic product is seen expanding 4.6% in 2024 from the prior year, and India to rise 6.8% this year, the IMF said. Officials left the 2025 regional outlook unchanged at a 4.3% advance.Several risks remain, the IMF said. Chief among them is a long-term property sector downturn in China, which would weaken demand and prolong deflation. Other challenges include growing fiscal deficits and risks to trade from US-China tensions.Officials also warned Asian nations of pinning too much on expectations for the Federal Reserve’s path when deciding their own monetary policy. Indonesia this month unexpectedly raised interest rates to address a currency walloped by a strengthening US dollar. Southeast Asia’s largest economy is among many countries in the region contending with currency depreciation as the prospects of early Fed rate cuts wane.While following the Fed “could limit exchange rate volatility” but “it risks that central banks would fall behind (or move ahead of) the curve and destabilize inflation expectations,” Srinivasan wrote.","Asia is set to expand 4.5% in 2024 from the prior year, 0.3 percentage points higher than the October regional outlook.

China firms go 'underground' on Russia payments as banks pull back,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/china-firms-go-underground-on-russia-payments-as-banks-pull-back/articleshow/109683902.cms,"Going 'underground'

Sanctions warning

'Channel can be shut'

An appliance maker in southern China is finding it hard to ship its products to Russia , not because of any problems with the gadgets but because China's big banks are throttling payments for such transactions out of concern over US sanctions.To settle payments for its electrical goods, the Guangdong-based company is considering using currency brokers active along China's border with Russia, said the company's founder, Wang, who asked to be identified only by his family name.The US has imposed an array of sanctions on Russia and Russian entities since the country invaded Ukraine in 2022.Now the threat of extending these to banks in China - a country Washington blames for ""powering"" Moscow's war effort - is chilling the finance that lubricates even non-military trade from China to Russia.This is posing a growing problem for small Chinese exporters, said seven trading and banking sources familiar with the situation.As China's big banks pull back from financing Russia-related transactions, some Chinese companies are turning to small banks on the border and underground financing channels such as money brokers - even banned cryptocurrency - the sources told Reuters.Others have retreated entirely from the Russian market, the sources said.""You simply cannot do business properly using the official channels,"" Wang said, as big banks now take months rather than days to clear payments from Russia, forcing him to tap unorthodox payment channels or shrink his business.A manager at a large state-owned bank he previously used told Wang the lender was worried about possible US sanctions in dealing with Russian transactions, Wang said.A banker at one of China's Big Four state banks said it had tightened scrutiny of Russia-related businesses to avert sanctions risk. ""The main reason is to avoid unnecessary troubles,"" said the banker, who asked not to be named.Since last month, Chinese banks have intensified their scrutiny of Russia-related transactions or halted business altogether to avoid being targeted by US sanctions, the sources said.""Transactions between China and Russia will increasingly go through underground channels,"" said the head of a trade body in a southeastern province that represents Chinese businesses with Russian interests. ""But these methods carry significant risks.""Making payments in crypto, banned in China since 2021, might be the only option, said a Moscow-based Russian banker, as ""it's impossible to pass through KYC (know-your-customer) at Chinese banks, big or small"".The sources spoke on condition of anonymity, citing the sensitivity of the topic. Reuters could not determine the extent of transactions that had shifted from major banks to more obscure routes.China's foreign ministry is not aware of the practices described by the businesspeople to arrange payments or troubles in settling payments through major Chinese banks, a spokesperson said, referring questions to ""the relevant authorities"".The People's Bank of China and the National Financial Regulatory Administration, the country's banking sector regulator, did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken , after meeting China's top diplomat Wang Yi for five and a half hours in Beijing on Friday, said he had expressed ""serious concern"" that Beijing was ""powering Russia's brutal war of aggression against Ukraine"".Still, his visit, which included meeting President Xi Jinping , was the latest in a series of steps that have tempered the public acrimony that drove relations between the world's biggest economies to historic lows last year.While officials have warned that the United States was ready to take action against Chinese financial institutions facilitating trade in goods with dual civilian and military applications and the US preliminarily has discussed sanctions on some Chinese banks, a US official told Reuters last week Washington does not yet have a plan to implement such measures.The Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said, ""China does not accept any illegal, unilateral sanctions. Normal trade cooperation between China and Russia is not subject to disruption by any third party.""A State Department spokesperson, asked about Reuters findings that Chinese banks were curbing payments from Russia and the impact on some Chinese companies, said, ""Fuelling Russia's defence industrial base not only threatens Ukrainian security, it threatens European security.""Beijing cannot achieve better relations with Europe while supporting the greatest threat to European security since the end of the Cold War,"" the spokesperson said.Blinken made clear to Chinese officials ""that ensuring transatlantic security is a core US interest,"" the spokesperson said. ""If China does not address this problem, the United States will.""Nearly all major Chinese banks have suspended settlements from Russia since the beginning of March, said a manager at a listed electronics company in Guangdong.Some of the biggest state-owned lenders have reported drops in Russia-related business, reversing a surge in assets after Russia's invasion.Among the Big Four, China Construction Bank posted a drop of 14% in its Russian subsidiary's assets last year and Agricultural Bank of China a 7% decline, according to their latest filings.By contrast, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China , the country's biggest lender, reported a 43% jump in assets of its Russian unit. Bank of China (BOC), the fourth-largest, did not give the breakdown.The four banks did not respond to requests for comment on their Russian businesses or the impact on Chinese companies.Some rural banks in northeast China along the Russian border can still collect payments, but this has led to a bottleneck, with some businesspeople saying they have been lining up for months to open accounts.A chemical and machinery company in Jiangsu province has been waiting for three months to open an account at Jilin Hunchun Rural Commercial Bank in the northeastern province of Jilin, said Liu, who works at the firm and also asked to be identified by family name.Calls to the bank seeking comment went unanswered.BOC has blocked a payment from Liu's Russian clients since February, and a bank loan officer said firms exporting heavy equipment face more stringent reviews in receiving payments, Liu said.The manager at the listed Guangdong company said their firm had opened accounts at seven banks since last month but none agreed to accept payments from Russia.""We gave up on the Russian market,"" the manager said. ""We eventually didn't receive more than 10 million yuan ($1.4 million) in payments from the Russian side, and we just gave up. The process of collecting payments is extremely annoying.""Wang is also having second thoughts about his Russian business.""I may gradually shrink my business in Russia as the slow process of collecting money is not good for the company's liquidity management,"" he said.""What's more, you don't know what will happen in the future. The channel can be shut completely one day.""",China's big banks are throttling payments for such transactions out of concern over US sanctions.

It has cut the prices of its Shanghai-made vehicles by up to six per cent to maintain its leading position in China's premium EV segment.","Billionaire Elon Musk met Chinese Premier Li Qiang and discussed future expansion plans for his automobile.
