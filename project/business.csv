"ITR Filing FY 2023-24: What happens if I file income tax return after deadline? Check penalties, consequences for late filing",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/taxation/itr-filing-fy-2023-24-what-happens-if-i-file-income-tax-return-after-deadline-check-penalties-consequences-for-late-filing/articleshow/112105116.cms,"What is the penalty for belated ITR filing?

Who is required to pay the penalty?

Income Exceeds Basic Exemption Limit: Taxpayers whose income exceeds the basic exemption limit will be penalised for late filing. The limit varies by tax regime: Rs 3 lakh under the new tax regime, irrespective of age, and different limits under the old tax regime based on age.

Section 139(1) Conditions: Even if income is below the exemption limit, taxpayers must file an ITR if they meet specific conditions in Section 139(1). These include:

Spending Rs 2 lakh or more on foreign travel. Paying Rs 1 lakh or more in electricity bills. Depositing Rs 1 crore or more in current accounts.

Holding Foreign Assets: Residents with foreign assets or income must file an ITR, even if their income is below the exemption limit. Late filing fees apply in these cases.

Exceptions to Penalties

How is a belated ITR filed?

Income Tax Return Filing FY 2023-24 : For individual taxpayers whose accounts do not need auditing, the last date to file income tax returns (ITRs) for FY 2023–24 (AY 2024–25) is July 31, 2024. Missing this deadline means filing a belated ITR , which comes with penalties and interest.Under Section 234F of the Income Tax Act, 1961, filing a belated ITR incurs a penalty of up to Rs 5,000.For small taxpayers with a taxable income not exceeding Rs 5 lakh, the penalty is restricted to Rs 1,000, according to an ET report. The important thing to note is that this penalty applies even if the belated ITR shows zero tax payable. Additionally, penal interest on the pending tax payable must be paid when filing a belated ITR.Certain taxpayers are required to pay penalties if they miss the ITR filing deadline and they fulfil the following conditions:Also Read | ITR refund status for FY 2023-24: How to check income tax refund status online - here’s a step-by-step guide for incometax.gov.in & NSDL websites Individuals might need to submit an income tax return to receive a refund. However, if their taxable income is below the basic exemption limit, they will not face penalties for filing after the due date, according to income tax laws. This means the gross taxable income is considered before any eligible deductions are accounted for.The process for filing a belated ITR is the same as filing on time, with the key difference being the selection of Section 139(4) instead of 139(1) on the ITR form.","Filing a belated ITR incurs a penalty of up to Rs 5,000 under the Income Tax Act, 1961.

Boost for security forces on India-China border! The Border Roads Organisation ( BRO ), in collaboration with the Central Public Works Department ( CPWD ) and the National Projects Construction Corporation , has commenced the third phase of the strategic India, China Border Roads ( ICBR ) project.This initiative aims to enhance the road network in eastern Ladakh, facilitating faster movement of security forces along the Line of Actual Control.While some key roads under Phase II of ICBR are still under construction, most of the phase has been completed, providing all-weather roads for improved connectivity, according to an ET report.India and China share a 3,488 km border spanning across Ladakh, Arunachal, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and Sikkim. Following the 2020 standoff with the Chinese army at Galwan in eastern Ladakh, the Union government has accelerated the pace of road construction and identified new roads under the third phase of ICBR.According to official data, India has achieved a formation cutting rate of 470 km roads per year from 2017-20, a significant increase from the 230 km per year maintained in the previous decade until 2017. Under ICBR phases I and II, 73 roads were identified as strategic, with 61 of them assigned to BRO. In eastern Ladakh, five new roads have been identified under phase 3, to be constructed by BRO and CPWD. In many cases, single or double-lane roads have been upgraded to four lanes.Last week, Prime Minister Narendra Modi initiated the first blast for the Shinku La tunnel, which is expected to provide all-weather connectivity from Manali to Leh. The 4.1-kilometre tunnel is anticipated to facilitate the movement of armed forces and equipment.The Union Budget 2024 recently allocated Rs 6,500 crore to BRO for 2024-25, a 30% increase compared to the allocation for 2023-24.

The new format for IPO applications will also have separate sections for explaining complexities related to the offerings.""The document will be precise, meaningful and any variation will be explained separately,"" she said. Puri Buch was speaking at industry trade body FICCI's annual Capam event in the city.Currently, all companies that have filed offer documents with Sebi aim to raise about Rs 80,000 crore from the market, sources said. The deluge of IPO application papers had forced Sebi to allocate resources from other departments to the one that deals with new offers, they added.Sebi is also working on a process that will combine the processes of taking regulatory approval for rights and preferential issues. The plan is to have a two-page document that will have all the relevant information relating to the planned fund-raising but could nearly halve the time for obtaining Sebi's approval. The process would also be cost effective since it would eliminate the intervention of merchant bankers, Sebi chief said.Later during the conference, Sebi's whole-time member Kamlesh Chandra Varshney said that the regulator was finalising a consultation paper to bring in rules to regulate financial influencers.

The full amount is scheduled to be paid by Aug 9.""As it has been generally said, the first hour of justice is the hour of compromise... where the offer has been made by one of the suspended director (Riju), at the behest of the corporate debtor (Byju's), to bury the hatchet forever with the operational creditor (BCCI), the court can invoke Rule 11 (of NCLAT Rules, 2016) for the purpose of exploring settlement between the parties... in view of the undertaking given and the affidavit filed (by Riju), the settlement between the parties is hereby approved and as a result thereof.... the impugned order is set aside,"" the judge said while pronouncing the order.The court said that the settlement is being arrived at before the committee of creditors could be formed and the source of the money is not in dispute.In a statement, Byju's said that during the court proceedings, it became clear that the promoters of the company have gone to great lengths and made immense personal sacrifice to keep their company running. ""Today's NCLAT order is not just a legal victory, but a testament to the heroic efforts made by our Byju's family in the last two years. Today, we stand not just stronger, but more united than ever,"" said Raveendran who is in Dubai even as his Bengaluru-based company is fighting for survival.The NCLAT also said that the US lenders of Byju's could not provide any evidence to establish that the funds being used by Riju to settle BCCI's dues is part of the missing $533 million, quashing their claims of round tripping. The $533 million, which the lenders have accused Byju's of hiding, is part of the $1.2-billion term loan B proceeds that they had extended the company in 2021. The lenders who argued that the payments to BCCI are allegedly fraudulent had approached a US court on Thursday, understood to be seeking some kind of an injunction.","The NCLAT on Friday approved a settlement between the troubled startup and BCCI over a dispute related to non-payment of Rs 159 crore dues that the edtech company owed to the cricket governing body. The appellate tribunal's order means that Byju's can now exit insolvency, putting founder Byju Raveendran back in the saddle as the CEO.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112237000,imgsize-15826,width-400,resizemode-4/112237000.jpg"

Budget 2024 capital gains tax changes: The Narendra Modi government is considering suggestions for tweaks in the new long term capital gains tax regime that was announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman in Union Budget 2024.The July 23 budget reduced the LTCG tax on property from 20% to 12.5%. The indexation benefit, which allowed taxpayers to adjust the acquisition cost for inflation before calculating capital gains and thus reduce their tax liability, is proposed to be eliminated for properties purchased on or after April 1, 2001.The government publishes the Cost Inflation Index (CII) annually for this calculation.India Inc is appealing to the government for a gradual shift to the long-term capital gains tax regime proposed in the FY25 budget, which aims to eliminate indexation benefits for property, gold, and other unlisted assets.According to an ET report by Deepshikha Sikarwar, the industry is suggesting alternatives such as a higher tax rate with indexation or a lower rate of 12.5% without indexation, as well as some form of grandfathering for ancestral properties.The finance ministry is currently reviewing these proposals and will discuss them with the Prime Minister's Office. The final decision will be made closer to the date when the Finance Bill reply is to be presented in Parliament, the reports said.Industry groups are expected to submit formal proposals to the finance ministry in the near future.

Budget 2024 for manufacturing sector : The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth. While the middle class has been offered tax relief, the government's primary focus remains on judicious spending to maximize economic impact. The budget's core themes are employment, skilling, MSME development, and support for the middle class.Largely focus has remained intact on spending money judiciously to ensure that each penny spent creates a ripple effect in the entire economic landscape.Although at first glance, manufacturing might appear to have taken a backseat, a deeper analysis reveals a multifaceted approach to bolstering the sector. Initiatives like employment-linked benefits and internship programs, while primarily aimed at job creation and skill development, indirectly benefit manufacturing companies by expanding the talent pool.Extensive focus on the MSME manufacturing units by way of extending term loan facility for purchase of machinery and equipment without collateral or third-party guarantee, would help companies in augmenting their capital base/ capacity and strengthen the very foundation of the manufacturing ecosystem in the country. Development of a new credit-assessment model by Public Sector Banks to assess MSME credit shall provide much needed regulatory relief to the units.With respect to the large manufacturing entities, while there is no direct fiscal/ tax incentive introduced in this budget, some support has been provided with an extensive focus on development of ‘industrial parks’ in nearly 100 cities under the ‘plug and play’ model. Reforms proposed with respect to land administration, planning and management, shall also ease out acquisition related difficulties often faced by entrepreneurs/ business houses in acquiring lands for manufacturing set-ups.Targeted Customs duty interventions like, rationalization of Customs duty provisions in Mobile phone manufacturing setups, extension of Customs duty exemption on import of capital goods for manufacturing of solar cells and panels, full Customs duty exemption on import of 25 critical minerals,, shall provide the required impetus for enhancing domestic manufacturing environment.Governments’ focus on formulating an Economic Policy Framework to set the scope for next-gen reforms in the country, has a target to improve the productivity of factors of production, namely, land, labour, capital, entrepreneurship and technology. This shall pave the way for enabling achievement of a target of 25% manufacturing sector contribution to the nation’s GDP over the course of next 7-10 years.While the overall outlook is positive, the extension of tax benefits under Section 115BAB for manufacturing entities and the absence of new PLI schemes are notable omissions.The country’s manufacturing base is expanding as is reflective from the continuously increasing tax collections and expanding Purchasing Manager’s Index. It would be pertinent to see how the ground realities evolve vis-à-vis the vision envisaged, in the upcoming Financial Year.","The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth.

Budget 2024: Armed with the vision to propel India to become a developed country by 2047, the Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business thereby providing the required stimulus to the manufacturing sector and enabling large scale job creation.On the Indirect tax front, the industry welcomes the much-needed announcement for a comprehensive review of the rate structure under Customs enabling ease in product classification and dispute reduction. The proposal of lowering of Customs duty on a plethora of raw materials and products including solar cells, critical minerals and bullion are encouraging measures. The rationale behind such reduction clearly indicates support towards domestic manufacturing, deepening value addition and supporting targets in reducing carbon footprint.Relevant amendments under the Customs law have been made to provide increased time limits for re-imports and re-exports to enhance competitiveness of the fledgling MRO sector. The government has extended significant duty reduction and exemption benefits to the healthcare and electronics sectors, continuing the impetus of incentives provided under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme.Since their introduction in March 2020, the PLI schemes have indeed supported in revitalizing the manufacturing sector and strengthening the necessary supply chains. The success achieved in the mobile manufacturing sector has now enabled the Government to reduce customs duties on mobile phones and components, signalling a mature environment. The Budget proposals aim at reproducing similar outcomes for semiconductor and pharmaceutical industry by increasing the budgetary allocation.Buoyed by the increasing revenue collection under GST signalling a shift towards a mature tax regime, this Budget has harmonized the timeframes for the issuance of demand notices and adjudication orders for cases involving fraud, suppression or otherwise. Significant amendments to the GST legislations have been introduced reflecting the recommendations proposed by the GST Council such as regularizing non-levy of GST due to general practice which may turn out to be a breather for certain impacted industries reeling under huge tax demands.The Insurance sector has been provided much relief through the GST council recommendations which have been cemented in the present budget thereby ending long standing disputes on their business practices.The Government's efforts to push forward with its reform agenda are evident as plans to incentivize states for their business reform actions plans and digitalization through the Jan Vishwas Bill 2.0 is proposed. Further, setting up of e-commerce export hubs is envisaged to facilitate easier access to international markets for domestic players.The recent implementation of Budget proposals allows the government to maintain momentum in its reform agenda. These policy measures implicitly reaffirm the significance of India Inc as a crucial element in the development of infrastructure. However, there are still some expectations required to be met to march towards a Viksit Bharat 2047.",The Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business.

Budget 2024 : Real estate, a significant contributor to employment generation, has received a fair bit of attention in Budget 2024-25. Recent years have seen the sector transform rapidly, driven by factors such as favourable government policies, Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, strong economic growth and changing consumer preferences.Added to that, the budgetary focus on job creation, skilling and employment-linked incentives, infrastructure, urban development, rural connectivity, digitalisation and land-related norms, all dovetail to promote growth of the sector.Launched in June 2015, the PMAY aims to provide affordable housing to all eligible beneficiaries. The budget unveiled PMAY Urban 2.0, under which the housing needs of 1 crore urban poor and middle class will be addressed with an investment of Rs 10 lakh crore.The central government’s additional Rs 2.2 lakh crore injection in the next 5 years to make housing more affordable has the potential to revitalise the affordable housing market.Such an approach can play an important role in realising the government's vision of Housing for All and push growth and development. Hence, the significant investment under PMAY Urban 2.0 is expected to alleviate urban housing deficits, spurring construction and economic growth.Steps to introduce technological reforms within the regulatory framework for land, such as digitalisation or GIS mapping of land records, will improve transparency.Rationalisation of stamp duty across states will also be critical to bring in uniformity and initiate land-related reforms such as urban planning, usage and building bylaws.These are steps in the right direction and will boost growth. Moreover, they will improve the ease of property transactions and strengthen municipal finances through increased property taxes. Rationalization of stamp duty with an emphasis on women homebuyers may boost home-buyer sentiment in major cities, too.The budget has also given ample attention to urban and rural development, with rental housing for industrial workers through the public private partnership model, interest subsidies for rental housing, and transit-oriented developments.The proposal to develop investment-ready plug-and-play industrial parks in 100 cities may attract industrial investment, leading to increased demand for industrial real estate and support the growth of ancillary services and residential developments in these regions.Initiatives for industrial parks and rental housing for industrial workers align with the country’s manufacturing goals and addresses worker accommodation needs.These steps are expected to promote industrial growth and stability in labour-intensive sectors, while also creating new opportunities for real estate developers specialising in rental and affordable housing.The changes in long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax, however, have evoked a mixed reaction. The government lowered the long-term capital gains tax from 20% to 12.5%, which is a welcome step. However, this came with the removal of the indexation benefit.The changes could encourage more liquidity in property transactions and potentially increase the effective tax burden depending on the property’s acquisition date.The launch of Phase IV of the PM Gram Sadak Yojana in 25,000 rural habitations will improve connectivity in rural areas, promoting rural development and making these regions more accessible for investment. The primary objective of PMGSY is to build robust, all-weather roads in rural habitations. This initiative focuses on enhancing connectivity and supporting economic development in rural areas.In essence, the budget is geared towards stimulating growth and investment in the real estate sector , fostering a more transparent and investor-friendly environment, and contributing to overall development. It aims to create a balanced and inclusive growth environment by addressing the needs of various segments, including affordable housing, industrial workers and urban infrastructure.The effectiveness of the initiatives, however, hinges on their implementation and continued support of complementary reforms.","Budget 2024-25 is geared towards stimulating growth and investment in the real estate sector.

New Budget 2024 rule: Why Income Tax Department is likely to issue a huge number of tax notices this month,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-budget-2024-rule-why-income-tax-department-is-likely-to-issue-a-huge-number-of-tax-notices-this-month/articleshow/112186079.cms,"Taxing Times

Income Tax Notice on the way? The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month, as there are concerns that many taxpayers might escape the tax net due to the impending implementation of the new reassessment law on September 1, 2024.According to the amended regulation announced in Budget 2024 , the tax authorities can only go back a maximum of five years to reassess a taxpayer's records if the escaped income is at least Rs 50 lakh, and three years for an amount less than Rs 50 lakh.Previously, they could reassess cases up to 10 years old.According to an ET report, tax officials are now faced with the challenge of compiling and corroborating data on tax and income mismatches for the financial years 2013-14 to 2017-18 within the next few weeks, as these years will become time-barred for reassessment from September 1, 2024.The I-T department relies on information from various sources, such as banks, property registrars, and search findings from the investigation wing, to build reassessment cases.A tax officers' body has raised concerns about the feasibility of issuing notices under Section 148 (or 148A) in a large number of cases within a single month, given the overburdened nature of the jurisdictional assessing officers and the time-consuming process of obtaining sanction from the chief commissioner, who is the specified authority for such notices.Moreover, the law provides taxpayers with the right to explain their position before reassessment orders are finalized, a process that most believe cannot be completed by the end of August.Also Read | ITR refund status for FY 2023-24: How to check income tax refund status online - here’s a step-by-step guide for incometax.gov.in & NSDL websites The Central Board of Direct Taxes ( CBDT ) has been urged by its officers to postpone the effective date of the proposed amendment. However, this suggestion is unlikely to be well-received by corporations and high net worth individuals.""Capping the reassessment period at five years was a great decision as it would reduce hassles and litigation. But if the department fears there could be a genuine loss of revenue as it may not be possible to wrap up several matters by August 31, the government can think of strict parameters where time-bound cases can be selectively reopened - based on trails of steps taken in identifying escaped income,"" said Mitil Chokshi, partner at CA firm Chokshi & Chokshi.""Taxpayers may expect a rush of reassessment notices in August 2024. These notices are likely to be for the AYs 2018-19 and prior to that. It is pertinent to note that the Bombay High Court in a recent ruling in a case of Hexaware Technologies has taken a view on a proviso introduced in 2021, which can be interpreted to mean that AY 2017-18 (and prior years) got time barred on March 31, 2024. These reassessment notices (for AYs 2017-18 and prior) are likely to rake up new interpretation issues in the already muddled reassessment provisions,"" said Ashish Mehta, partner at law firm Khaitan & Co.The current situation is similar to the conflict between the Income Tax office and taxpayers in 2021. The reassessment law was amended in April 2021, allowing the tax office to reopen 10-year-old tax returns if the total undisclosed income exceeded Rs 50 lakh and reassess 4-year-old matters if the amount was less than Rs 50 lakh.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? However, this change led to over 10,000 writ petitions being filed by companies, arguing that they were not given sufficient time to explain and that the notices were issued without considering the carve-out that cases which couldn't be reopened earlier couldn't be reassessed under the new law.The Supreme Court invoked its extraordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution on May 4, 2022, to uphold all reassessment notices issued after March 31, 2021. However, the court left room for judicial proceedings based on the merits of each case, and several such matters are currently pending before the court.","The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month.

NPS and EPF: Overlapping services

What is NPS Vatsalaya?

Latest NPS rules, news: In the Union Budget 2024 speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced two new initiatives with regard to National Pension Scheme (NPS) - extension of NPS 14% employer contribution benefits to private setcor and the intended launch of NPS Vatsalya.Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries, bringing it at par with the provisions available for government employees.Sriram Iyer, CEO, HDFC Pension Management told ET that with this move the “ground rules have been harmonised among government and non-government employees, which is a positive step.”Effectively, this means that now, private-sector employees can choose to reduce the taxable portion of employers’ contribution to their NPS corpus, thereby paying less tax and leaving greater funds in their pension deposits.“Employees will benefit from tax savings . More importantly, the 40% increase in contribution will have a significant impact on the terminal value of the retirement corpus,” remarked Iyer. The extended savings will “help in retirement planning, working as an option that is at par with the Provident Fund,” Dinesh Rohira, CEO & Founder, 5nance.com was quoted as saying.Moreover, the endeavour aims to increase NPS penetration by increasing tax incentives for the private sector, providing them a social security-cushion post-retirement.The scheme’s motive to widen the NPS subscriber base may not prove to be flawlessly effective, however. This is explained by Agrees Mrin Agarwal, Founder, Finsafe India: “While it’s good that the limit has been raised, it may not increase adoption as employees need to be educated in a big way. Also, the benefit is only for the salaried opting for the new tax regime,” she says.The mandatory contribution to the EPF, too, threatens to relegate the provisions of NPS under the umbrella of near-superfluity. This sentiment is echoed by Varun Sahay, a software engineer in a Delhi-based IT company: “When 12% of my salary is already deducted for the EPF, why should I put in more in the NPS and cut my take-home pay?”Rohira feels otherwise. “There’s no competition between the NPS and EPF as employees can contribute to both and build a 3-4 times bigger corpus while earning 3-4% higher returns via marketlinked options in the NPS,” he counters.Also Check | New Tax Regime 2023 vs 2024 After Budget: How Much Income Tax Will Salaried Taxpayers Save & How Do New Tax Slabs Compare To Old Regime? Top 10 Points You Must Know To jumpstart retirement savings for children, a new initiative called NPS Vatsalya has been unveiled in the Budget. This scheme allows parents and guardians to contribute to a minor's account, which can be converted into a regular NPS account once the child reaches adulthood.""It provides a very long duration for reaping the compounding benefits and accumulating a huge bounty at a later age. This can be a good way to plan a better future for kids who may not opt for a service segment in the future,"" says Rohira. Sriram Iyer agrees, stating, ""It’s a good move to help the child start his retirement journey. Even if a parent starts when the child is 10 years old, by the time he starts working, it can be a solid foundation for the compounding journey after that.""However, some experts question the utility of a product with such a long lock-in period, especially when parents cannot use the funds for essential goals like their child’s education amidst soaring education costs of 11-12%.""Parents are struggling to save for their own retirement, so it might be a bit of a stretch to expect them to save for their kids’ retirement. The need of the hour is a market-linked product that allows withdrawals only for the child’s education,"" says Mrin Agarwal, Founder of Finsafe India.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? Though the NPS permits partial withdrawals, it allows only 25% of the corpus after three years of joining, and this can be done only three times during the entire tenure. A premature exit before 60 years with 100% withdrawal is only possible if the corpus is less than Rs.2.5 lakh, an amount insufficient for most children's goals.""In its current form, there won’t be any uptake,"" asserts Agarwal. Rohira concurs, ""It’s a vanilla product with a lock-in, which does not make it very attractive and it may not take off. However, the government may optimise it and introduce new features later."" Iyer adds, ""This is just a start and there may be more subscriber-friendly features as we take it to the market. The regulator is proactive and open to feedback.""","Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries.

Gold import duty cut: Why Indians may not find buying gold from Dubai as attractive post Budget 2024,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-import-duty-cut-why-indians-may-not-find-buying-gold-from-dubai-as-attractive-post-budget-2024/articleshow/112097671.cms,"Gold import duty cut in Budget 2024: The recent reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai. Indian jewellers with stores in both India and the UAE believe that the narrowed duty differential will result in lower gold prices in India, making it less attractive for Indians to purchase gold in Dubai.The emirate had attracted gold-enthusiast Indians following a steep rise in customs duty in India in July 2022. In the fiscal 2024-25 budget, the duty on gold imports was more than halved.The duty cut is also expected to boost gold jewellery production in India, particularly the popular 'Kolkatti' jewellery from Kolkata, which is favored by Indian expats in Dubai and tourists from various countries. This move will encourage gold artisans to create new designs in both heavyweight and lightweight jewellery, attracting consumers to purchase gold from India.According to an ET report, Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group , estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India as Indian tourists who previously bought jewellery in Dubai will now prefer to shop in India. However, Indian expats living in Dubai and other customers may continue to buy from the UAE.Also Read | Gold losing sheen?

Gold trade analyst Bhargav Baidya suggests that the 1% duty differential between gold jewellery in India and Dubai will be offset by Indian jewellers offering discounts to retain and attract customers.Saurabh Gadgil, chairman of PNG Jewellers, notes that Indian import duty is now on par with the US, allowing Indian jewellers to offer competitive prices compared to other countries worldwide. The reduced customs duty is expected to make gold purchases in India more attractive and convenient for Indian consumers, potentially leading to a significant shift in their gold shopping preferences.",The reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai. Indian jewellers with stores in both India and the UAE believe that the narrowed duty differential will result in lower gold prices in India.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112098027,imgsize-124986,width-400,resizemode-4/112098027.jpg"
Gold losing sheen?

Gold losing sheen? The government has reduced its target for issuing gold bonds in the financial year 2024-25 by 38% compared to the previous interim budget goal, according to a senior official. The revised target stands at Rs 18,500 crore, down from Rs 29,638 crore estimated in the interim budget and Rs 26,852 crore (revised estimate) in 2023-24.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told ET ""The decision followed a reassessment of various factors, including investor demand, other investment products and uncertainties around the global economy, as the situation has changed since the interim budget in February.""After accounting for redemptions, the net issuances of sovereign gold bonds are now estimated at Rs 15,000 crore for this fiscal year, a significant decrease from the Rs 26,138 crore projected in the interim budget and Rs 25,352 crore in the revised estimate for 2023-24.Harish Galipelli, director at ILA Commodities India, attributed this shift to retail investors increasingly opting for equities in anticipation of better returns. He also noted that people are uncertain about the potential for further increases in gold prices in the short-to-medium term following a recent rally. Additionally, Galipelli pointed out that savings in rural areas have been impacted by retail inflation and other factors.The gold bond and gold monetisation schemes were introduced by the government in late 2015 to discourage the physical purchase of precious metals and reduce imports, thereby mitigating the negative impact on the current account deficit.The gross collection through these two schemes is now projected to be Rs 20,030 crore in 2024-25, compared to Rs 31,168 crore in the interim budget and Rs 28,240 crore (revised estimate) in the previous fiscal year. Similarly, the net collection is estimated at Rs 16,433 crore, down from Rs 27,571 crore in the interim budget and Rs 26,653 crore in the previous year. However, the estimates for the gold monetisation scheme remain unchanged from the interim budget level.Also Read | Budget 2024: Duty cuts on gold, silver, platinum, and diamonds to make jewellery more affordable The sovereign gold bond scheme targets investors who view gold as an investment, encouraging them to purchase paper gold instead of physical gold.On the other hand, the gold monetisation scheme aims to bring out idle gold held by households, temple trusts, and others to increase domestic supply. Both schemes were designed to curb gold imports, which, along with crude oil, have been significant contributors to India's current account deficit. Gold bond issuances had moderated after reaching Rs 16,049 crore during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020-21, before experiencing a surge in 2023-24.","The government has reduced its target for issuing gold bonds in the financial year 2024-25 by 38% compared to the previous interim budget goal.

1% TDS on property purchase over Rs 50 lakh even in case of multiple buyers or sellers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/1-tds-on-property-purchase-over-rs-50-lakh-even-in-case-of-multiple-buyers-or-sellers/articleshow/112032080.cms,"Mumbai: In case of purchase of immovable property (other than agricultural land) from a resident seller, of over Rs. 50 lakh, a TDS of 1% will apply, even if there are more than one buyers and the contribution of each buyer works out to less than Rs. 50 lakh. The same principle will also apply in case of multiple sellers, where the share of each seller is less than Rs.50 lakh, but the aggregate sale-price of the property is over Rs. 50 lakh.The 1% TDS applies on the purchase price or the stamp duty value, whichever is higher. This amendment proposed in Budget 2024 , comes into effect from October 1.The explanatory memorandum points out that, “Some taxpayers are interpreting that the consideration being paid or credited refers to each individual buyer’s payment rather than the total consideration paid for the immovable property.” The memorandum illustrates that based on this interpretation, if buyers are paying less than Rs. 50 lakh each, no tax is being deducted, even if the purchase value of the immovable property or stamp duty value exceeds Rs. 50 lakh. “This is against the intention of the legislature,” it states.“Accordingly, it is proposed to amend sub-section (2) of section 194-IA of the Act to clarify that where there is more than one transferor (seller) or transferee (buyer) in respect of an immovable property, then such consideration shall be the aggregate of the amounts paid or payable by all the transferees to the transferor or all the transferors for transfer of such immovable property.”Tax experts point out that buyers should be aware of this change as the penalties for not deducting and depositing tax at source are significant. In addition to deducting and depositing the TDS the buyers also have to issue the TDS certificates after generating the same on the I-T department’s e-portal (TRACES). This amendment will increase the compliance burden for buyers.","The 1% TDS applies on the purchase price or the stamp duty value, whichever is higher.

The details of the provisions will only be clear once finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman introduces the bill in Parliament.

But unclaimed deposits soared to over Rs 78,000 crore at the end of March, 2024 despite banks launching drives to settle claims.Separately, the law is also proposed to be amended to allow for transfer of dividends and bonds to the Investor Education Protection Fund (IEPF) if the money is lying unclaimed. Currently, only shares of banks are transferred to IEPF.Govt has also proposed to give banks greater freedom in deciding the remuneration to be paid to auditors, a decision that was hitherto left to RBI.

In any case, they pointed out that a circular issued by the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs on June 26 had sought to remove ambiguities.

Infosys had also not shown the expenses as sales revenue.The law and circular, experts and officials said, provided that entities were entitled to full input tax credit (ITC) and the valuation given by them, including nil valuation, had to be accepted by the tax department.On its part, authorities in DGGI seem to have factored in that the IT major, generated nearly 40% of its revenue at various branches for sales and onsite work, which, according to the agency, is subject to 18% Integrated GST (levied on imports). The consolidated revenue from July 2018 to March 2022 was estimated to be around Rs 4.3 lakh crore. Of this, roughly Rs 1.7 lakh crore was attributed to the branch-level sales and onsite work. Applying the IGST rate of 18% on this portion of the revenue would result in a tax of approximately Rs 31,000 crore, showed a rough calculation by TOI.Tax professionals have expressed concerns that the an assertive approach to GST taxation will impact govt's drive to ease life for businesses.","Karnataka GST authorities ""stepped back"" and withdrew their ""pre-show cause"" notice.

NEW DELHI: Days after three UPSC aspirants drowned after rainwater accumulated on the road flooded the library at Rau’s IAS coaching centre in central Delhi’s Old Rajender Nagar, Anand Kumar , the renowned founder of Super 30 , expressed his concerns about the current state of coaching institutes . Kumar pointed out that students have now become 'clients' for the coaching centres.Despite the prevalence of online content, students still flock to Delhi for coaching, prompting Kumar to comment on the future of educational centers and the need for a shift towards online education .""They can read. It's my prediction that might be wrong. In the coming 10 to 15 years, 90 per cent of these coaching institutes are going to disappear. I can say this from my experience,"" said Kumar.""Now only one per cent of experiments have been done in the field of online classes.

He noted that considerable effort has gone into producing quality educational materials like NCERT books and suggested a similar initiative for online coaching.""I would like to appeal to the government for form a team for UPSC aspirants and free coaching. After years of effort, a good book like NCERT has been written. I am praising the book and not the government. I am praising the team involved in writing the book.

I request coaching institutions that education should not become a business but rather, continue the teaching process by keeping the interests of the children at the center,"" Kumar added.Kumar also pointed out that many coaching centers today refer to parents as ""clients,"" highlighting the commercialized nature of modern education.Earlier, Rajya Sabha chairman Jagdeep Dhankar said on Monday that coaching has become ""virtually commerce.""""I find that youth demographic dividend of the country has to nurtured, I further find that coaching has become virtually commerce every time we read a newspaper front one or two pages are by way of advertisements.

Amazon reports boost in quarterly profits but misses revenue estimates,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/amazon-reports-boost-in-quarterly-profits-but-misses-revenue-estimates/articleshow/112215057.cms,"Amazon's quarterly profits has surged, but the company's revenue fell short of analysts' expectations. For the April-June period, Amazon reported earnings of $13.5 billion, exceeding the $10.99 billion anticipated by industry analysts surveyed by FactSet. This marks an increase from the $6.7 billion earned during the same period last year. Earnings per share for the second quarter were $1.26, surpassing analysts' expectations of $1.03.Despite the positive earnings, investors reacted negatively to other results, leading to a more than 6% drop in Amazon shares after the closing bell.The company's revenue of $148 billion, a 10% increase, slightly missed analyst expectations of $148.67 billion. Amazon also provided a lower-than-expected revenue forecast for the current quarter, ending Sept. 30, ranging from $154 billion to $158.5 billion, compared to the $158.22 billion predicted by analysts.During the Covid-19 pandemic, Amazon increased its spending to meet the higher demand from consumers who relied more on online shopping. However, as demand cooled and other parts of its business faced economic pressures, the company implemented aggressive cost-cutting measures, including eliminating unprofitable businesses and laying off more than 27,000 corporate employees. These cost-cutting efforts have contributed to the growth in profits.Amazon is also benefiting from the excitement surrounding generative artificial intelligence, which has helped revitalize its cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services (AWS), after experiencing a slowdown. The company reported a 19% increase in revenue for AWS compared to the same period last year. ""We're continuing to make progress on a number of dimensions, but perhaps none more so than the continued reacceleration in AWS growth,"" said Amazon CEO Andy Jassy in a statement.However, Amazon is expected to increase its spending this year to support AWS. Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky stated that the company spent more than $30 billion on capital expenditures during the first half of the year, primarily to enhance infrastructure for AWS, and anticipates further increases in the second half. Like other tech companies, Amazon is investing in data centers, chips, and power infrastructure to support AI workloads.Meanwhile, Amazon's core e-commerce business experienced a more modest 5% revenue growth, excluding sales from its annual Prime Day discount event. Olsavsky attributed the slower growth in North America to customers being cautious with their spending and opting for cheaper items.The company's advertising business, primarily consisting of ad listings on its online platform, saw a 20% jump in sales. Amazon recently began placing ads on movies and TV shows on its Prime Video service to generate additional revenue. Prime Video also secured an 11-year media rights deal with the National Basketball Association, alongside two other companies.Despite these developments, Amazon faces challenges, including a recall of more than 400,000 hazardous products sold by third-party sellers on its platform and an antitrust lawsuit alleging overcharging of sellers and stifling competition. Amazon's results followed earnings reports from other tech giants such as Microsoft, Meta, and Alphabet Inc, the parent company of Google.(With inputs from agencies)","Amazon reported earnings of $13.5 billion, exceeding the $10.99 billion anticipated by industry analysts.

"Intel to lay off 15,000 employees in major cost-cutting move",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/intel-to-lay-off-15000-employees-in-major-cost-cutting-move-amid-struggles-against-rivals/articleshow/112209650.cms,"Intel Corp. announced on Thursday that it will cut approximately 15% of its global workforce, amounting to 15,000 jobs, in a bold attempt to streamline its operations and remain competitive with industry leaders like Nvidia and AMD . The sweeping layoffs come as part of a broader strategy to save $10 billion by 2025, according to a memo from Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger .“Simply put, we must align our cost structure with our new operating model and fundamentally change the way we operate,” Gelsinger wrote. He cited disappointing revenue growth and the company’s slow adaptation to emerging trends like artificial intelligence (AI) as key reasons for the drastic measures.The job cuts follow a challenging quarter for Intel, which reported a $1.6 billion loss in its April-June earnings report, alongside a slight revenue decline to $12.8 billion. The disappointing performance led to a 19% drop in Intel’s stock during after-hours trading, signaling a potential $24 billion loss in market value when trading resumes on Friday.To further curtail expenses, Intel also announced the suspension of its stock dividend, a move that underscores the severity of the company’s financial woes. The layoffs and other cost-cutting measures are expected to be largely completed by the end of the year.In his memo, Gelsinger acknowledged the difficulty of the decision, calling it “the hardest thing I’ve done in my career.” The company plans to offer enhanced retirement options and a voluntary departure program for eligible employees.Analysts, however, are skeptical that these cuts alone will be enough to reposition Intel in the rapidly evolving semiconductor market. “Intel’s announcement of a significant cost-cutting plan including layoffs may bolster its near-term financials, but this move alone is insufficient to redefine its position in the evolving chip market,"" said eMarketer analyst Jacob Bourne.Intel has struggled to keep pace with competitors like Nvidia, whose dominance in the AI chip market has been a particular challenge. Unlike its rivals, Intel also manufactures its own chips, which has placed additional pressure on the company’s margins as it invests heavily in expanding its U.S. foundry business.The company’s efforts have been buoyed by significant support from the U.S. government, particularly through the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act, which aims to bolster domestic semiconductor manufacturing. Intel has secured up to $8.5 billion in direct funding and $11 billion in loans to build new chip plants across the country, part of a long-term strategy to reduce reliance on Asian-made semiconductors.Despite these investments, Gelsinger acknowledged that Intel’s focus on the AI PC market would strain profit margins in the short term, though he expressed confidence that the trade-offs would pay off in the coming years. “We believe the trade-offs are worth it. The AI PC will grow from less than 10% of the market today to greater than 50% in 2026,” he told analysts.","Intel Corp. announced on Thursday that it will cut approximately 15% of its global workforce, amounting to 15,000 jobs.

How some companies manipulated the H-1B visa lottery,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/how-some-companies-manipulated-the-h-1b-visa-lottery/articleshow/112201712.cms,"Each year in April, the US conducts a lottery that shapes the lives of hundreds of thousands of people. And each year, only around 85,000 are granted an H-1B visa for highly-skilled workers. With skyrocketing application numbers, the odds of winning have only gotten slimmer. But new data obtained by Bloomberg News has revealed how certain companies have manipulated the system, gaining an advantage over people who play it fair.In other words, the game was rigged.On today’s Big Take podcast, host Sarah Holder speaks to investigative journalists Eric Fan and Zachary Mider, who explain how outsourcing companies and staffing firms exploited loopholes in the H-1B system to get extra shots at the lottery.Here is a lightly edited transcript of the conversation:Holder: When Sandeep Maganti first moved to the US from India for college, he had a passion for technology and a laser focus on the future.Maganti: I was a teenager that was hoping to build a whole new life and whole new career and trying to see where my luck or all my hard work takes me at that point.Holder: After getting a computer science degree from Arizona State University, he teamed up with a fellow ASU alum to launch a startup.Maganti: It's an AI-powered real estate investment platform. We run the models on the back end, predicting the revenue of short-term real estate investments or commercial real estate investments.Holder: Sandeep said they raised $400,000 from a private investor and turned their idea into a company valued at over a million dollars. It was just a few years into his time in the US, and he was already on track to build the kind of life and career he’d dreamed of as a teenager. But something else loomed over him. He’d managed to stay in the country legally through a student visa and a series of work authorizations, but his status in the States was still temporary. And that meant he was living with a lot of uncertainty.Holder: And throughout all this, Sandeep, did your immigration status weigh on you at all? How did it impact your work?Maganti: So that's been the whole problem. You can't have a solid decision or like anything solid until you have your immigration plan solid because you can't buy a house or you can't build a business or you can't do whatever you're looking for in your life. It’s not something you can be stable on. It impacts every decision that you're making in your life.Holder: Sandeep wanted a more long-term plan. So he stepped away from the day to day of running his startup, got a job at another US-based company and set his sights on the H-1B — a visa designed for highly-skilled workers with employers in the US. A limited number of H-1B visas are handed out each year through a lottery system. And the first time he applied, he wasn’t picked. Or the next. Or the next.Maganti: It was really devastating for me. I was like eight years into the United States, and I still don't have a life which I can rely on or a career that I can rely on. So I don't have clarity on what I need to do.Holder: Sandeep had the job and the sponsor. But his lottery ticket wasn’t drawn.Eric: His qualification didn't matter. His investment and entrepreneurship didn't matter. The fact that he was already employing people and starting a company here didn't matter. It was a complete game of luck.Holder: Eric Fan is an investigative data reporter at Bloomberg. And for the past few months, he’s been looking into how the H-1B system actually works. And he found that there’s something else at play — making that game of luck even more precarious, and it’s stacking the deck against workers and employers who seem to be doing everything right. Today on the show: a Bloomberg investigation reveals how companies have been exploiting loopholes to game the H-1B system — and what that could mean for hundreds of thousands of visa hopefuls.Holder: Every year, employers in the US submit hundreds of thousands of applications for H-1Bs, hoping to give their employees a shot at a visa. An H-1B typically lasts up to six years, and is often an on-ramp to permanent residency. The number of visas awarded every year is currently capped at about 85,000. But when Eric tried to figure out the chances of getting one, he noticed that between 2020 and 2023, the number of applications for that limited pool had doubled. That meant the odds of getting an H-1B visa were getting worse, fast.Fan: So, as I talked to my friends, as I go online, it became very apparent that there's a huge problem in the system.Holder: And that problem goes back to the way the system was designed.Mider: Since the very beginning, the program has sort of been dogged by concerns that certain companies were kind of finding a way to get a disproportionate share of the visas.Holder: That's Bloomberg investigative reporter Zach Mider. He says the flaws in the system trace back to the way the H-1B program was set up in response to pressure from tech companies that started building in the 1980s.Mider: Employers in the US were telling Congress, we can't get enough workers in certain fields, especially high-tech fields. And so when Congress reformed its immigration laws in 1990, they said, we're going to create this category of visa called H-1B that's going to be specifically for high-skilled workers that you don't think you can find in the American job market.Holder: At first, the system was first come, first serve. The vision was that employers would apply for the visas gradually throughout the year — and once they ran out, the government would stop granting them. But by the mid-2000s, it was clear that the system needed to change. Because on April 1st every year, when the visa application window opened, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services office would be overrun.Fan: Hundreds of thousands of applications were coming in literal paper boxes from FedEx. And the US government would have so much trouble processing those paperwork, there wasn't enough time for them to figure out who came first and who came second. It became a necessity to run a random lottery.Holder: A random lottery… with very expensive tickets.Fan: Employers had to file a full visa application, which runs hundreds of pages. They have to pay thousands of dollars in application fees. They have to describe exactly what job they want to fill. Here's the individual, here's the job, here's the salary we're going to pay them, here's the location they're going to work from.Holder: But in any lottery, the odds of winning go up if you buy more tickets. The same principle applied to the H-1B lottery. Employers who could submit more applications had a better chance of getting their employees visas. And Zach says, that gave an advantage to certain types of companies, like huge IT outsourcing firms, mostly based overseas.Mider: Let's say you're an outsourcing company that has 200,000 workers in India, and you have a need for a certain number of those workers to be in the United States for a certain period of time. If you say, figure you need a thousand of them next year, but you're not too particular about which thousand, then you can simply do the math and you could say, well, my chances of success in the lottery are, you know, 25%. And I need a thousand people. So I'll put in 4,000 applications of people who would be good enough at those roles, and I'll get about a thousand. And so, while your company that just had the one worker has a 25% chance of getting what they want, the outsourcing company can kind of leverage its foreign workforce to get 100% of the visas they want.Holder: In 2020, the Trump administration changed the application process. Instead of entering the lottery with a full-fledged application, employers would only need to fill out a short form and pay a $10 fee to get their employee’s name in the mix. Then, only if their lottery ticket was drawn would they need to go through with the whole application. The goal was to cut down on paperwork and save money. But it also had another effect.Fan: That massively increased the opportunity to flood the lottery.Holder: When tickets got cheaper in 2020, Eric and Zach said it created opportunities for another kind of company to game the system: staffing firms. These firms essentially work as middlemen: recruiting foreign workers and connecting them with contract jobs at US-based companies. And part of their pitch is that they can get you an H-1B visa because of how adept they’ve become at gaming the system.Mider: The new opportunity worked like this. If I have a person who I want to help get a visa, I can simply just create a bunch of other companies or just conspire with other companies that already exist to put that person's name in multiple times. And so it becomes a system where, essentially, if someone wants a visa and they can kind of work with these— a group of these very small companies. They can almost be guaranteed to get one. And so the chances really skyrocket for people who are willing to work with these kinds of companies that are willing to cheat and kind of budge ahead in the lottery. And so anybody who's just doing it the old-fashioned way of like, I actually have a real job and I want this worker to have an H-1B. They get pushed to the end of the line because they're not putting the person's name in more than once.Holder: Zach says those staffing firms have been able to fly under the radar. Because many of them are very small.Mider: If it was Apple or Tesla that did this, I think with thousands of employees, I think the government would have caught on pretty quickly and probably tried to do something to them. But these are all like companies you've never heard of, often that don't really have much physical existence. Like maybe they have an office, maybe they don't, maybe they're just like an LLC that somebody created without much real existence at all.Holder: For a long time, it was impossible for reporters like Eric and Zach to figure out the extent of the problem or which companies were the worst offenders.Fan: That data was never public and we had to file a FOIA lawsuit. So for the first time, we're able to say exactly how many companies are gaming the system. And we were very surprised because we've found thousands and thousands of them. And it became immediately clear that these staffing companies have— sometimes 99%, 100% of their entries are these multiple entries as compared to a regular company, such as Apple, Google, would usually have less than 5%.Holder: There are legitimate reasons for someone to have multiple applications entered on their behalf – say, if they have competing offers from several companies to sponsor them. But those situations are uncommon. So when Eric found these instances in which 100% of a company’s applicants were being entered multiple times, the stat was striking.Fan: I thought there was a problem, but it was so much worse than I imagined. And it turned out almost half of all the visas that were approved last year went to either outsourcing or staffing companies, meaning for most of the folks who study and live and work in the US who have a job offer from one of the top companies like Google and Tesla, they're losing out.Holder: So Eric and Zach identified the biggest H-1B cheaters, the question was, would anything be done to stop them? That’s after the break.Holder: A Bloomberg investigation found that about half of the coveted H-1B skilled worker visas between 2020 and 2023 were going to outsourcing companies and staffing firms — and that an estimated one in six involved the slippery tactic of submitting multiple lottery entries for the same person.Holder: What's the impact of this type of gaming of the system? Who exactly is this hurting?Mider: I think the big picture is it's hurting the American economy.Holder: According to a 2023 Wharton School study, for every 10 H-1B visas that top US multinational companies lose out on, nine jobs are moved abroad. The Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond estimated that reducing the number of high-skilled immigrant workers in the US by 10% would shrink the economy by about $86 billion. So there's the economic toll. There's the toll on H-1B hopefuls who are competing in a lottery that's rigged. And then there's the toll on the H-1B recipients whose futures are now tied to companies that skirt the rulesFan: So I've interviewed a number of workers and former workers at these staffing companies and what they told me was they usually knew full well that staffing companies pay them very little and there’s no job security and they often had to sign contracts that forbid them from leaving the company for years. And most egregiously, they were often asked to pay the lawyer fees and visa fees and registration fees, which is not allowed.Holder: Eric and Zach wanted to know, what happened to the companies that they found were bending the rules?Mider: Now, some of the visa recipients have had their visas taken away and have to be sent home or whatever. But the companies themselves, which often were kind of the masterminds of this, don't really have any consequences that we can see. And so, what the government says in response is essentially they don't have the authority to bar anyone from the lottery. And so as long as people keep submitting applications and there's nothing on the application that looks suspect, they have to keep handing out visas to these companies.Holder: Have you gotten comment from any of these companies? What do they say about their practices?Mider: We spoke to a representative of the staffing industry, who said that the laws are actually pretty vague. And that, in his view, it wasn't really clear, especially during the first couple years of this new program, that it was actually forbidden to collude with other companies to put people's names in multiple times. And even after it kind of became more clear that that wasn't allowed under the law, the government may have not followed the proper procedures to kind of make sure everyone is aware of that. And so, from the staffing industry's perspective, it wasn't so much cheating as more just like they saw an opportunity in the law and they took it.Holder: That opportunity no longer exists. Last year, the US government made a significant change to the system that shifted the dynamics of the lottery.Fan: So, last year the government introduced new rules so that each candidate has an equal chance in the lottery. So instead of selecting on the number of registrations submitted by employers, each candidate, regardless of how many registrations they have, has an equal chance. So that drastically removed the incentive to cheat. That removed the incentive for staffing companies to collude and submit multiple registrations.Holder: And Eric says that change has had an immediate effect.Fan: This year, according to government data, the number of multiple registrations declined 90%.Holder: Specific loopholes like these have been opening and closing for decades. But a big takeaway of Eric and Zach’s reporting is that the H-1B program has fallen far short of its initial goal.Mider: Immigration is a very difficult issue for Washington. The last time there was a real effort to reform the immigration system was more than a decade ago, and it kind of famously failed and collapsed. And up until this point, even when there's been times of a lot of consensus about fixing H-1B, it's always been thought of as something we have to resolve as part of this bigger immigration deal, which means that in practice, it'll never get done.","Each year in April, the US conducts a lottery that shapes the lives of hundreds of thousands of people.
