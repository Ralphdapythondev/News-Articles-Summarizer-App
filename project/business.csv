Budget 2024 expectations : Ahead of the upcoming Union Budget 2024 presentation on July 23 by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman , the government is weighing a proposal to significantly raise the minimum guaranteed amount under its flagship social security initiative , the Atal Pension Yojana (APY).Currently, the scheme offers a guaranteed minimum pension ranging from Rs 1,000 to Rs 5,000 per month, depending on the subscriber's contributions.However, according to an ET report, in a move aimed at enhancing social security benefits, the Modi government is contemplating doubling this amount to Rs 10,000 per month. The decision on this proposal is expected closer to the budget date.The potential hike in APY benefits comes amidst efforts to strengthen India's social security framework, aligning with the imminent rollout of the labour code on social security.As of June 20, the Atal Pension Yojana has garnered over 66.2 million enrolments, with 12.2 million new accounts added in the fiscal year 2023-24 alone.""Some proposals have been made for making the Atal Pension Yojana more attractive, including increasing the guaranteed amount. These are being examined,"" commented an official.Also Read | Budget 2024: Insurance cover under Ayushman Bharat PMJAY scheme to be doubled to Rs 10 lakh? Earlier this year, Deepak Mohanty, Chairman of the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA), highlighted the need to enhance the guaranteed pension amount, citing concerns over its adequacy in meeting future needs.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has previously underscored APY's success in targeting the poor and lower-middle-class segments, noting the scheme's deliberate design to ensure widespread affordability and accessibility.Introduced as part of the National Pension System (NPS), Atal Pension Yojana allows subscribers to exit the scheme at the age of 60, with options for annuitisation of pension wealth upon retirement. Notably, individuals liable to pay income tax are excluded from enrolling in the scheme, reinforcing its focus on supporting economically disadvantaged groups.","The government is weighing a proposal to significantly raise the minimum guaranteed amount under its flagship social security initiative, the Atal Pension Yojana.

The Vizhinjam International Sea Port , India's largest transhipment port in Kerala, has welcomed its first container ship, a large cargo vessel named 'San Fernando' from China. The ship's arrival was celebrated with a water salute by four tugs that guided it to the dock, marking a significant milestone for India's largest transhipment port.The ship, with a capacity of 8,000 to 9,000 TEUs, is owned by the prominent shipping company Maersk and arrived from Xiamen Port in China.The 300-meter-long San Fernando is set to unload 1,900 containers at Vizhinjam International Seaport Limited (VISL).The mothership carries large containers that will be transferred to other vessels and subsequently transported to various ports within the country and internationally.Vizhinjam, equipped with state-of-the-art equipment and advanced automation and IT systems, is poised to become India's first semi-automated port.Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd (APSEZ) is responsible for the development of the Vizhinjam International Seaport. Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan acknowledged Adani Group's commitment to completing the project within the stipulated timeframe.The port's construction, which commenced in 2016, is a public-private partnership project with a total investment of Rs 8,867 crore. The Kerala state government contributed approximately Rs 5,595 crore, while the central government provided Rs 818 crore towards the port's development.

Budget 2024 income tax expectations: Why new tax regime is likely to be made more attractive,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2024-income-tax-expectations-why-new-tax-regime-is-likely-to-be-made-more-attractive/articleshow/111717575.cms,"By Tanu Gupta

Popularizing the New and Simplified Personal Tax Regime

Increasing the standard deduction

Direct payment of income tax refund to overseas bank accounts

(The author is Partner Mainstay Tax Advisors LLP. Views expressed are personal)

Budget 2024 income tax expectations : Increase in the limits of various exemptions and deductions is one of the prime expectations of the individual taxpayers from any Union Budget. But with the current government’s focus on a simplified tax regime with minimal exemptions and deductions, do the taxpayers need to adjust their old-time favorite expectation ? Should the taxpayer expect tax reliefs in the New Tax Regime instead ? Either way, the individual taxpayers have high hopes from this Budget, especially in the absence of any tax proposals announced in the interim budget in Feb 2024.In this article, I list some of the expectations of individual taxpayers from the Union Budget 2024 to be presented on 23 July 2024.A New Personal Tax Regime was introduced in Budget 2020 which was simple, in the sense that it allowed for very limited exemptions and deductions. To increase the takers for this regime and make it more tax beneficial for them, the Government then brought several changes in the new regime. Such as allowing standard deduction , higher basic exemption limit of Rs 3 lakh (as against Rs 2.5 lakh in the old regime), wider tax slabs, reduced surcharge from 37% to 25% on incomes above Rs 5 crore, nil tax liability for individuals with incomes up to Rs 7 lakh etc.The government further made it a default tax regime w.e.f. FY 2023-24, continuing to move to its vision of a simplified tax system in India.Marching towards the same goal, I expect that the government may propose further changes in the regime, to attract even those taxpayers who are still opting for the old tax regime. This may involve either further relaxing the slabs by widening them or restructuring them. Currently, 30% tax rate is applicable on incomes above Rs 15 lakh. The government may increase the same to Rs 20 lakh.Also Read | Budget 2024: Government may offer guarantee under NPS to allay fears Standard deduction is a vanilla / blanket tax deduction allowed to the salaried taxpayers, irrespective of the expenses or investments done by them.To provide further tax relief to the salaried taxpayers while keeping the tax system simple, I expect that the government may increase the standard deduction from Rs 50,000 to Rs 75,000 under the new tax regime.The income tax return form provides for mentioning the foreign bank account for direct credit of income tax refund, where the Non-Resident taxpayer does not have an Indian bank account. However, practically, such a facility is not yet active and the refunds cannot be credited to the foreign bank account for the NR taxpayer.Also Read | Income Tax expectations Budget 2024: Tax exempt limit for savings account interest to be raised to Rs 25,000? With a focus to improve taxpayer services and increasing use of technology and digital platforms in the tax system, I hope that the government activates the facility of direct credit of tax refund to foreign bank accounts.With India on its track to “Viksit Bharat” by 2047, and with a high growth target, the Government may put more disposable income in the hands of taxpayers, so as to further fuel consumption and growth of the economy. Therefore, one may expect some tax reliefs in the Union Budget 2024, however, they may continue to be along the same theme followed in earlier budgets – simplifying and rationalizing the India tax system!","Budget 2024 income tax expectations: Increase in the limits of various exemptions and deductions is one of the prime expectations of the individual taxpayers from any Union Budget.

What makes capital gains tax so complicated & how to simplify it,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/what-makes-capital-gains-tax-so-complicated-how-to-simplify-it/articleshow/111822078.cms,"By Prachi KulkarniIncome tax rules on capital gains are complex, with different holding periods and tax rates for different assets. The length of time an asset is held by a taxpayer determines if the gains are considered long-term (LTCG) or short-term (STCG), affecting how they are taxed.For LTCG, the holding period also influences if indexation benefits apply.Indexation allows adjusting purchase price for inflation, thereby lowering the tax.The current system is marked by a patchwork of holding periods and tax rates tailored to specific asset types. The above list (see table) is only illustrative, and the capital gains tax rules must be carefully reviewed for each asset type. The complexities increase further with the availability of indexation benefit on LTCG for certain class of assets (e.g. land and building), and not for certain other assets (e.g. listed shares). The capital gains tax provisions for certain assets vary between resident and non-resident taxpayers too.One simplification could be to standardise taxation for all asset classes. For example, a single 10% tax rate on LTCG could be applied to all financial assets, such as equity shares, preference shares, and mutual funds, with a uniform holding period of over 12 months to qualify as LTCG. Similarly, a consistent holding period of more than 24 months could be established for all non-financial assets.There are some other provisions that need a relook. For instance, the law stipulates that share transfers by a shareholder in a merging company are not considered transfers, provided certain conditions are met. This exemption is only granted when shares are held as an investment. If shares are held as stock-in-trade, the profits from their sale are taxed as business income, and the exemption does not apply. This distinction should be eliminated, extending the exemption to shares held as stock-in-trade.(The writer is tax director, EY India; Views expressed are personal)",The current system is marked by a patchwork of holding periods and tax rates tailored to specific asset types. One simplification could be to standardise taxation for all asset classes.

Truth has won and BJPs conspiracy has been defeated: AAP

Supreme Court grants interim bail to CM Arvind Kejriwal in money laundering case, AAP claims victory over BJP conspiracy. Court order highlights lack of evidence. Party emphasizes the need for new politics and good governance.

NEW DELHI: Seeking to ensure a timely payments for micro, small and medium enterprises, the ministry of corporate affairs has asked all companies to disclose information on payments made or overdue to such small businesses on a half-yearly basis.The move comes amid demands for a review of income tax provisions that allowed only the amount that has been cleared to be used as a deduction for expenditure by companies.The provision has split small businesses, some of whom have complained of being forced to deregister as an MSME.Ahead of the Budget, MCA has issued a new form that requires payments to all MSMEs as well as outstandings for 45 days or less or dues pending for over 45 days to be disclosed along with the reason for delay. For long, overdues have been a major concern for small businesses as they typically depend on internal generation to meet their funding requirement with only a small portion relying on bank credit. In fact, access to bank credit has been a major area of concern, which the govt is seeking to address.A paper by ICRIER economists Radhicka Kapoor and Tanu Goyal has suggested that the use of digital public infrastructure has helped address a part of the problem, but the gap still remains. “The first phase of the Account Aggregator (scheme) rollout (April 2022 – Jan 2023) in India has resulted in early positive benefits to the MSME sector. Of the total loans disbursed during the period, about 38% of the unsecured business loans were disbursed to MSMEs. The AA network has lowered cost of doing business, reduced paperwork, and enabled a turnaround with loans available in 3-5 clicks in a digital process,” they said in a paper.Industry bodies have suggested several steps in the Budget to address the concerns of MSMEs. “There is a pressing need to establish a dedicated working group tasked with identifying underperforming schemes related to MSMEs,” said Assocham president Sanjay Nayar.","Ahead of the Budget, MCA has issued a new form that requires payments to all MSMEs as well as outstandings for 45 days or less or dues pending for over 45 days to be disclosed.

Gig workers find it tough to assess advance tax payment,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gig-workers-find-it-tough-to-assess-advance-tax-payment/articleshow/111822080.cms,"MUMBAI: The employment stratosphere is constantly evolving. It is no longer a rarity for a salaried individual to have a side gig. Further, the number of non-salaried gig workers is also on the rise.Non-salaried have to meticulously compute and pay their own advance taxes. The Income-tax (I-T) Act prescribes for payment of advance taxes if a taxpayer's liability is more than Rs 10,000.Salaried individuals can disclose their total income (including the non-salary portion, such as bank interest) to their employer, who then deducts tax at source (TDS), each month. If not, they must ensure advance taxes are duly paid as the tax deducted at source by the employer would not cover their entire tax liability .Those with income flowing from gigs find it difficult at the very onset of a financial year to estimate their income for the entire year. This results in difficulties in correctly paying the first instalment of advance tax, which falls due on June 15 - within just 75 days from the start of the new financial year. The first instalment calls for payment of 15% of the annual tax liability.Under section 44ADA of the presumptive scheme, individuals can pay their entire advance tax in one instalment by March 15. However, moonlighters (who also hold a job) typically do not opt for the presumptive tax scheme where 50% of the gross revenue has to be offered to tax. Further, this side income is not disclosed to the employer to facilitate TDS.Section 234C provisions, which entail payment of interest for an entire three-month period for non-payment or shortfall in a particular instalment till the next instalment, date is perceived as harsh.Currently, 15% of the tax liability for the year is to be paid by June 15, 45% by Sept 15, 75% by Dec 15 and the full sum by March 15. Prior to the 2016 amendment, the three due dates for payment of advance taxes for individuals were Sept 15 (30% of the tax liability), Dec 15 (60% of the tax liability) and March 15 (100% of the tax liability).The Bombay Chartered Accountants Society (BCAS), in its pre-Budget memorandum, states that prior to the 2016 amendment, only corporates had to pay advance tax in four instalments. In addition to seeking reinstatement of a three-instalment mechanism for individuals, it adds that the threshold limit of Rs 10,000 - which was set by the Finance Act, 2009 - needs a suitable upward revision.The sting lies in the penal interest prescribed under section 234C of the I-T Act. Sandeep Jhunjhunwala, partner at Nangia Andersen LLP, said, ""Even a one-day delay in any of the first three quarterly instalments results in a substantial 3% interest charge for the delayed quarter. Ideally, a more nuanced approach should be implemented. For example, if the June 15 instalment is paid by July 14, a lower interest rate of perhaps 1% could be applied.""","Non-salaried have to meticulously compute and pay their own advance taxes.

IDBI Bank: IDBI Bank Disinvestment: Govt's Next Move After RBI's 'Fit & Proper' Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/idbi-bank-disinvestment-govts-next-move-after-rbis-fit-proper-report/articleshow/111819164.cms,"NEW DELHI: With RBI giving its “fit and proper” report on bidders for IDBI Bank , all eyes are now on govt and the Budget as the market awaits for a signal on disinvestment .IDBI Bank has been up for privatisation for several years, and govt had been awaiting an RBI’s assessment on bidders meeting the “fit and proper” norms — or are compliant with regulations and are not under the scanner of other regulators — to move to the next stage of the process.RBI has given its report on all but one bidder, a foreign player, which did not share information and the overseas regulator too has not provided data. Govt holds 45.5% in the erstwhile development financial institution that became a bank, with LIC being the largest shareholder with over 49% stake.The plan envisages the sale of 60.7% in the bank, including govt’s 30.5% and LIC’s 30.2%. Based on the current market cap of almost Rs 95,000 crore, the Centre can hope to realise almost Rs 29,000 crore from the disinvestment, although several observers have said that the terms of the transaction are not very attractive.While the Modi govt had lined up an ambitious privatisation agenda, including public sector companies such as BPCL, Concor, BEML, Shipping Corporation, IDBI Bank, state-run lenders and an insurance company, it has failed to report any progress with a virtual freeze on the exercise for the last 18 months as the general elections were due.While there were expectations that things will move post-polls, but the verdict has put a question mark over the fate of disinvestment, especially with petroleum minister Hardeep Puri recently stating that BPCL privatisation has been shelved.Modi govt stance on privatisation is eagerly awaited, given that this time it is dependent on coalition partners and the Budget is likely to provide cues.Given the recent rise in PSU stocks, the govt can hope to meet its disinvestment target of Rs 50,000 crore during the current financial year.While the govt has repeatedly spoken about getting out of sectors that are “non-strategic”, in the last 10 years, it only has the Air India disinvestment to count as a success.Market observers see IDBI Bank as an easier entity to divest, given that it is a private lender for all practical purposes with govt stake rising due to massive capital infusion to help the bank deal with bad debt-driven losses.","RBI has given its report on all but one bidder, a foreign player, which did not share information.

The halwa ceremony also marks the beginning of the process of printing all thebudget documents in preparation for the presentation in Parliament.Every year, before the ""lock-in"" process of budget preparation begins, a traditional halwa ceremony is held.The halwa ceremony holds great significance as it signals the commencement of the lockdown at the finance ministry. During this period, no official is permitted to exit the ministry premises.The entire Budget team can only depart after the financial document has been presented in Parliament. Since 1980, the Union Budget has been consistently printed in the basement situated at the North Block.With the upcoming Budget Presentation, Sitharaman will surpass the record set by former Prime Minister Morarji Desai, who presented five annual budgets and one interim budget between 1959 and 1964 as finance minister.

Budget 2024: Why Modi government is likely to maintain disinvestment and dividend targets of close to Rs 1 lakh crore,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2024-why-modi-government-is-likely-to-maintain-disinvestment-and-dividend-targets-of-close-to-rs-1-lakh-crore/articleshow/111780424.cms,"Outlook for FY25

Analysts' Perspective

Budget 2024 expectations : The Modi government is likely to maintain its revenue collection targets of nearly Rs 1 lakh crore for the fiscal year 2024-25 (FY25) through disinvestment , asset monetization, and dividends from non-financial Central Public Sector Enterprises ( CPSEs ), according to senior officials.The interim budget presented in February combined disinvestment and asset monetisation under the 'miscellaneous capital receipts' category, instead of listing them separately, according to an ET report.This change pegged the combined realisation for the current fiscal at Rs 50,000 crore, up from the revised estimate of Rs 30,000 crore for FY24.Additionally, another Rs 48,000 crore was expected from dividends from non-financial CPSEs and entities where the government holds minority stakes. The actual dividend collections have surpassed initial estimates for the third consecutive year, reaching a new high of Rs 63,749 crore in FY24, approximately 27.5% higher than the revised estimate of Rs 50,000 crore.This remarkable performance, as noted by the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM), reflects the robust health of state-run firms across various sectors. Disinvestment and asset monetization also showed strong results, with proceeds totaling Rs 16,507 crore and Rs 16,000 crore respectively, beating the combined revised target of Rs 30,000 crore for FY24.Also Read | Budget 2024 income tax expectations: Top 5 things FM Sitharaman should do for taxpayers - from tax slab changes to hiking standard deduction Despite these successes, the government is not inclined to increase its revenue targets for FY25 from the levels set in the interim budget, the rationale being to guard against presenting ""estimates that will fall short of actual realisations and upset resource allocation plans,"" in the words of an official.A final decision on the specific asset monetisation target will be made closer to the budget presentation on July 23. The government anticipates significant proceeds from the planned privatisation of IDBI Bank and divestments in Shipping Corporation of India and NMDC Steel, among others, in FY25.Analysts at CareEdge Ratings have noted that with a substantial dividend of Rs 2.11 lakh crore from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the government's fiscal position remains robust, potentially reducing the urgency to aggressively pursue divestments.The combined target for divestment and asset monetisation represents just 1.6% of the government’s budgeted non-debt receipts for FY25, indicating a reduced reliance on these revenues to manage the fiscal deficit.Also Read | Budget 2024: Top 3 steps Modi government should consider for employment generation However, CareEdge analysts have identified a significant disinvestment potential of about Rs 11.5 lakh crore at current market valuations, assuming the government maintains at least a 51% stake in public firms and offloads excess shares.DIPAM Secretary Tuhin Kanta Pandey had previously emphasised that setting overly high annual disinvestment targets could create market uncertainties and adversely impact the value creation strategy for the CPSEs. Therefore, the government is committed to a ""calibrated disinvestment strategy"" to optimise outcomes, he said.","The Modi government is likely to maintain its revenue collection targets of nearly Rs 1 lakh crore for the fiscal year 2024-25 (FY25) This is through disinvestment, asset monetization, and dividends from non-financial Central Public Sector Enterprises ( CPSEs ), according to senior officials.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111780695,imgsize-49796,width-400,resizemode-4/111780695.jpg"

4. Tax Benefits for Home Buyers:

5. Enhancement of long-term capital gains exemption limit

Other procedural amendments

Currently, home buyers who purchase property from non-residents (NR) are required to compute the income of the seller and deduct appropriate tax on such income. This casts an onerous obligation on the individual home buyers. In fact they are also required to obtain Tax Deduction Account (TAN) and file quarterly withholding tax returns. Contrast this with the situation where the seller is a resident – they buyer simply has to deduct 1 percent TDS on sales proceeds and file a challan-cum return without obtaining a TAN. A similar system, with a higher rate of TDS say 2 or 5 per cent, may be introduced for buyers of residential property from a NR taxpayer. Electric vehicles (EV) are the future. In line with the ESG agenda of the organization, many employers are encouraging employees to consider an EV in their employer car lease arrangement. However, the current perquisite rules provide for valuation only based on the cubic capacity of the car. Hence, it may be prudent for the Government to specific a separate value for EVs as well.

Budget 2024 income tax expectations : The Finance Minister (FM) will present the full Union Budget for Financial Year (FY) 2024-25 in Parliament on July 23rd. The Budget is of significant interest to individual taxpayers as they have a long wish list of the desired announcements on the personal tax front from the newly formed government.Some of the heightened expectations are as under:It is anticipated that the government may raise the income tax exemption limit to Rs 5 lakh from the current Rs 3 lakh limit under the new tax regime in the upcoming Budget. The new tax regime is the default tax regime now. However, there are taxpayers still opting for the old tax regime to avail of HRA exemption, 80C deduction, etc. Hence, this increase in the basic exemption limit would provide even further encouragement for taxpayers to opt for the new tax regime. This would provide more disposable income in the hands of the salaried/pensioned taxpayers, thereby stimulating economic activity and consumption, without complex investment/ expenditure related conditions.In the last year’s budget, the FM effected some major changes in the new tax regime to attract taxpayers towards the same. A full tax rebate was also announced on taxable income up to Rs 7 lakh. This year, there is a further expectation for an increase in such a rebate to Rs 7.5 lakh. Such adjustment would provide much-needed relief to middle-income taxpayers, potentially boosting spending and investment.Also Read | Budget 2024 income tax expectations: Why new tax regime is likely to be made more attractive For salaried individuals, exemption towards medical reimbursement and conveyance allowance was done away with a few years ago in lieu of introduction of standard deduction. To keep pace with the ever-rising medical cost and the fuel cost, the standard deduction may be increased from the existing limit of Rs 50,000 to at least Rs 1 lakh.To boost the momentum in the real estate sector, one can expect an increase in tax benefits for home buyers. This could include increased deduction on home loan interest or principal repayment. Currently, the overall limit to claim loss under the head income from house property is restricted to Rs 2 lakhs p.a. This limit should be revisited and enhanced to, say Rs 3 lakhs p.a., to provide further impetus to the ‘housing for all’ initiative.Effective FY 2018-19, Long-term Capital Gains (‘LTCG’) exceeding Rs 1 lakh earned from transfer of equity shares of a company or a unit of an equity oriented mutual funds on which Securities Transaction Tax (STT) has been paid at the time of acquisition, are subject to taxation at 10 per cent, without the indexation benefit.

Budget 2024 expectations : India’s robust automotive industry is accelerating through a landscape transitioning in terms of demand, policy and technology. Given these variables, Budget 2024 will be crucial for the industry for three reasons.One, while the industry was rebounding after the Covid-19 pandemic, passenger and commercial vehicles faced growth hurdles, such as supply-chain disruptions, semiconductor shortage and a steep rise in commodity prices.Then in fiscal 2023 pent-up demand gushed forth and continued to chug along last fiscal. The industry could thus shake off degrowth and low-capacity utilization. Yet, recovery in a few segments continues to lag with volumes far below the pandemic levels. The right impetus will thus be key to accelerate all segments.Two, the industry is navigating a technological overhaul. The advancements, collectively known as CASE (connected, autonomous, shared and electric), will lead to cleaner powertrains, added safety, and connected and autonomous features. These consider vehicles as a shared service rather than assets for ownership.At the same time, transmission, mechanical and electronic systems are also becoming more advanced.The industry is taking the disruption head-on — electrification has gained traction this year and the share of other cleaner technologies such as hybrid and compressed natural gas has increased. However, futuristic technologies, including flex fuel, hydrogen and fuel cell, will need propulsion to translate into commercial reality. Long-term policy clarity on that front will help industry navigate through short-term bumps.Three, the structural nature of the automotive industry itself demands that it remain robust. It supports multiple sectors as part of its long value chain. Major industries such as steel, rubber, plastics, electronics, and other semi-processed and intermediary components are critical end-users. Retailing, servicing, banking, insurance, fueling, charging, logistics and personal and commercial mobility are some important forward linkages.Given this milieu, we believe the budget should focus on the following measures:It could restore the benefit of a higher deduction of 200%, as earlier. Such benefits are available to companies in many geographies, especially the ones in South Asia.The government’s focus on infrastructure should continue. It has a multiplier effect not only on employment, thereby generating income prospects, but also creates significant opportunities for EPC (engineering, procurement and construction) players/contractors, increasing demand for steel and cement and investments thereof. This will help bolster the commercial vehicles industry segment through higher sales and logistics service providers with better turnaround time on account of improved road infrastructure, thereby supporting the objective of reducing the logistics cost.The scrapping policy is a step in the right direction. But the government needs to put in place adequate incentives for owners to scrap their older vehicles. Today, owners scrapping older vehicles are unlikely to afford new ones if there is no income security. So, they would tend to purchase pre-owned vehicles rather than new ones. The current incentives are just not lucrative enough to scrap vehicles. However, the right kind will help shrink the aging on-road fleet, reduce the proportion of BSI to BS-IV vehicles and lower emissions.Two-wheelers and commercial vehicles using alternative fuels (cargo vehicles, including three-wheelers L5 category and passenger segment for mass public commute and goods movement) can be made eligible for goods and services tax (GST) rationalization. The dual GST rate for auto components, i.e., 18% and 28%, encourages grey market distribution in the aftermarket space. This is a safety hazard on the one hand and an incentive to the informal economy and loss to GST revenue on the other. Hence, it would make sense to have one GST rate for all auto components at 18%.FAME-2 was extended for two years but ended in March 2024; the Electric Mobility Promotion Scheme (EMPS) ends in July. The government will need to announce longer-term policy support for the electric vehicles (EV) industry in the budget. The consistency in its structure and fewer frequent changes by the government would reduce confusion, thereby enabling increased private sector capex. Inclusion of private players for charging infrastructure and light, medium and heavy commercial vehicles under the policy will also help proliferate EV adoption in India. The focus should also be to remove the challenges/issues currently existing to install chargers at a community level.The automotive tyre industry caters to local demand and has the potential to become a large foreign exchange earner for India. New technologies such as run-flat tyre, smart tyres, noise reduction, puncture-proof and tyres for EVs, have been introduced in this industry as well. These advancements require companies to invest heavily in capex and R&D. Extending the PLI scheme to tyres would be a welcome step for the industry and help it become more competitive vis-à-vis China, Thailand and Vietnam in the exports market.Rupee trade with developing countries that are curtailing imports due to foreign exchange/dollar crisis and are important trade partners such as Egypt, Nigeria and Turkey will help maintain exports. Also, high trade deficit countries from which India imports, such as the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Iran and Iraq, do not manufacture automobiles. Free trade agreements with these countries would also help boost automobile exports.The introduction of Section 80EEB in the Income Tax Act in 2019 allowed a deduction of up to Rs 1.5 lakh per annum on interest paid for EV loans. This was a significant step, but the benefit was not extended beyond March 2023. Re-introducing the same and raising the deduction to Rs 2 lakh a year will encourage EV adoption.Any further enhancement in deductions under section 80 will help improve/increase disposable incomes in the hands of people, improving buying power and supporting sales of discretionary items, including automobiles.Taking these actionable steps in the budget can go a long way in boosting India’s automotive industry.","India’s robust automotive industry is accelerating through a landscape transitioning in terms of demand, policy and technology. Budget 2024 will be crucial for the industry for three reasons. The right impetus will thus be key to accelerate all segments.

Budget 2024: From income tax relief to infrastructure boost,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2024-from-income-tax-relief-to-infrastructure-boost-nomura-identifies-5-expected-themes-for-union-budget/articleshow/111750272.cms,"Budget 2024 expectations: 5 Key Themes

Nomura has identified five prominent themes that could shape the Budget:

1. Boosting Consumption: Income Tax Changes Expected

2. Enhancing Social Sector Spending

3. Promoting Manufacturing

4. Infrastructure Development

5. Establishing a Medium-Term Economic Vision

Budget 2024 expectations : As Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman prepares to unveil her seventh Budget on July 23, the Modi 3.0 government’s Budget will not only reflect the administration's response to new financial demands from its allies but also articulate its vision and reform agenda for the next five years. Brokerages such as Nomura anticipate a clear message of policy continuity and a robust commitment to fiscal consolidation.Nomura analysts Sonal Varma and Aurodeep Nandi predict that the government will lower its fiscal deficit target for FY25 from 5.1% to 5% of GDP. This adjustment would signal the government’s determination to maintain fiscal stability, even in the face of a weakened political mandate. The emphasis on fiscal discipline is expected to be a cornerstone of this year’s Budget, according to an ET report quoting Nomura.To stimulate consumer demand, the government may consider increasing the standard deduction limit for taxpayers under the new tax regime, which offers lower rates without exemptions. There could also be a rise in the exemption threshold for income derived from bank interest. Furthermore, a reduction in personal income tax rates for individuals earning between Rs 5 lakh and Rs 15 lakh is on the table, Nomura said, quoting reports.Also Read | Budget 2024 income tax expectations: Why new tax regime is likely to be made more attractive The Budget is likely to prioritize the rural sector by boosting allocations for various schemes. This includes an increase in subsidies for housing, estimated at Rs 23,000 crore (approximately 0.07% of GDP), along with enhanced funding for rural roads and employment initiatives. Additionally, the government might expand the public health insurance program and rejuvenate the Lakhpati Didi economic empowerment initiative for women.Nomura anticipates that the government will reaffirm its commitment to domestic manufacturing. Potential measures include raising the minimum local content requirement for public procurement, reinstating the 15% concessional corporate tax rate for new manufacturing facilities, and revising the 2019 policy on integrating the electronics global value chain. The Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme is also expected to be extended to electronic components.Also Read | Budget 2024 expectations: Ramp up private participation in airports & railways, says expert Public capital expenditure (capex) is poised to remain a fundamental aspect of the government’s economic strategy. Nomura forecasts an increase in the total capex outlay to 3.5% of GDP, up from 3.4% in the interim Budget. In response to state demands, the government might also enhance the unconditional transfers under the 50-year interest-free loan scheme for infrastructure projects.This Budget marks the first significant financial roadmap following the recent elections, making it a critical opportunity for the government to lay out its medium-term economic vision. Analysts expect a comprehensive plan that outlines India’s aspiration to become a developed economy by 2047, detailing specific objectives for the next five years.",Nomura has identified five prominent themes that could shape the Budget.

What does the bill say?

NEW DELHI: Amid the raging debate over the quota for locals in Karnataka , chief minister Siddaramaiah on Wednesday deleted his post on 'X' in which he confirmed the cabinet's approval of the bill , making it mandatory to recruit '100 per cent' Kannadigas for 'C and D' grade posts in all private institutions within the state.In his post on X, the CM said the government's commitment to the welfare of Kannadigas.""The Cabinet meeting held yesterday approved a bill to make it mandatory to hire 100 percent Kannadigas for 'C and D' grade posts in all private industries in the state. It is our government's wish that the Kannadigas should avoid being deprived of jobs in the land of Kannada and should be allowed to build a comfortable life in the motherland. We are a pro-Kannada government. Our priority is to look after the welfare of Kannadigas,"" Siddaramaiah wrote.The controversy over the bill brought into focus the ongoing tension between local employment policies and the needs of industries, particularly in a competitive global market.After apparent concern by industrialists in Karnataka over a Bill mandating 100 per cent reservation for Kannadigas in ""C and D"" grade government jobs , commerce and industries minister MB Patil assured that wider consultations will be held to address and resolve these apprehensions.He also ensured that the interests of both Kannadigas and industries will be protected.Patil acknowledged the concerns and stated that the government would work to clear any confusion caused by the new Bill. ""I have seen that many people have apprehension regarding this...We will resolve this confusion...We will sit with the CM and resolve this so that it does not have any adverse effect...,"" he stated when speaking to ANI on Wednesday.He emphasized the necessity of maintaining a balance between protecting the interests of Kannadigas and fostering a positive environment for industries.

In this competitive era, states like Karnataka, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, and Telangana are striving to be at their best. It is of utmost importance for all states to be at their competitive peak,"" Patil noted.Patil further stressed that Karnataka should not lag behind in this critical period of industrialization. ""Karnataka is a progressive state, and we cannot afford to lose in this once-in-a-century race of industrialization. We will make sure that everyone's interests are safeguarded. The Industries are assured that they need not have any fear or apprehensions and can rest assured,"" he articulated.This response came after the Karnataka cabinet approved a Bill on Tuesday seeking to reserve 50 percent of management jobs and 75 percent of non-management jobs for locals in the private sector, alongside the 100 percent reservation for locals in ""C&D"" grade government jobs.Several industry leaders in Karnataka expressed their objections to the new Bill, describing it as discriminatory and worrying about potential negative impacts on the tech industry.The reservation of jobs in private firms in Karnataka is limited to 70 percent for non-management positions and 50 percent for management-level roles.The Karnataka State Employment of Local Candidates in Industries, Factories and Other Establishments Bill, 2024 proposes that 50% of managerial roles and 70% of non-managerial roles in all industries, factories, and establishments in the state must be reserved for local candidates.The candidates without a secondary school certificate in Kannada must pass a Kannada proficiency test as specified by the designated agency.The bill allows establishments to train and engage local candidates in collaboration with government agencies if sufficiently qualified local candidates are not available within three years.In cases where an adequate number of local candidates cannot be found, establishments can seek relaxation, but the proportion of local candidates must not drop below 25% for managerial positions and 50% for non-managerial roles.",Chief minister Siddaramaiah deleted his post on 'X' in which he confirmed the cabinet's approval of the bill.

Bank Of England: UK inflation holds at 2% but underlying price pressures stay strong,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/uk-inflation-holds-at-2-but-underlying-price-pressures-stay-strong/articleshow/111806256.cms,"British inflation held at 2.0 per cent last month, defying forecasts for a slight fall, and underlying price pressures persisted, maintaining uncertainty about the date of the Bank of England 's first interest rate cut since 2020.Economists polled by Reuters had mostly expected headline consumer price inflation would ease to 1.9per cent in the 12 months to June, extending its drop from a peak of 11.1per cent in October 2022.Inflation for services was much stronger at 5.7 per cent, the Office for National Statistics said, unchanged from May. The Reuters poll had pointed to a slightly weaker 5.6per cent increase.Sterling rose against the dollar immediately after the data was published.The BoE - which has a target of consumer price inflation of 2 per cent - has expressed concern about the strength of services inflation, which largely reflects pressure from wage growth in a labour market short of candidates to fill jobs.Data due on Thursday is expected to show wages growing slightly less strongly than in data published a month ago but still rising by almost 6per cent - roughly double the rate that would be compatible with keeping inflation at 2per cent.The BoE is due to announce its next decision on interest rates on Aug. 1 and investors see a roughly 50per cent chance of a first cut to borrowing costs since 2020.A rate cut next month would give an early boost to new Prime Minister Keir Starmer and his finance minister Rachel Reeves who have said they will speed up the slow-moving British economy after winning power in a landslide election two weeks ago.But last week the BoE's Chief Economist, Huw Pill, said he was focused on persistently strong price pressures and said the timing of the first rate cut was an open question.Core inflation - excluding volatile food and energy prices - held at 3.5 per cent in the 12 months to June, the ONS said, matching the median forecast in the Reuters poll.The BoE had expected headline inflation of 2.0 per cent in June and services inflation of 5.1per cent, according to forecasts it published two months ago. The BoE also expected headline inflation to rise back above its target later this year and through 2025.","Inflation for services was much stronger at 5.7 per cent, the Office for National Statistics said.

This rally was fueled by expectations of potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve in 2024, which could boost the economy and corporate profits. The positive sentiment was further supported by strong earnings reports from major companies like Bank of America and UnitedHealth Group.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 742.76 points, or 1.85%, to 40,954.48, the S&P 500 gained 35.98 points, or 0.64%, at 5,667.2 and the Nasdaq Composite added 36.77 points, or 0.2%, at 18,509.34.Of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500, industrials enjoyed the largest percentage gains, while technology and communication services were the only two sectors to end in negative territory.Economically sensitive small caps extended their rally. The Russell 2000 scored a fifth straight day of gains greater than 1%, its longest winning streak since April 2000. The index gained 3.5%, touching its highest level since January 2022.Federal Reserve Governor Adriana Kugler's comments about the possibility of lowering interest rates sooner if the job market cools ""too much"" added to the optimism on Wall Street. Analysts believe that the current market environment assumes a perfect scenario where the Fed cuts rates while inflation slows down without pushing the economy into a recession. Additionally, rising expectations of a Donald Trump victory in the 2024 US presidential election, which could lead to tax cuts and deregulation, further contributed to the bullish sentiment.In contrast to the US market, European bourses experienced declines, with German investor confidence falling for the first time in a year. The International Monetary Fund maintained its global growth forecast for this year at 3.2% but trimmed its projections for the United States and Japan while warning of ongoing inflation risks and trade tensions.Gold prices also reached a new record, jumping 1.9% to $2,450.07 per ounce, driven by shifting expectations regarding the Fed's monetary policy. In Asia, markets were mixed, with Hong Kong experiencing losses in the tech sector, while other major indices saw modest gains or declines.

"'Just like real': Bill Gates-backed startup makes butter out of air, claims it tastes really good",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/just-like-real-bill-gates-backed-startup-makes-butter-out-of-air-claims-it-tastes-really-good/articleshow/111782626.cms,"A startup based in California , has claimed to have developed a process for creating butter without the use of milk or any other dairy product.The company, named Savor , backed by Microsoft founder Bill Gates said it produces butter using a combination of carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and oxygen chains, and asserts that the resulting product ""tastes like the real thing"", as reported by The Guardian.Savor has been conducting experiments to create dairy-free alternatives for various products, including ice-cream, cheese, and milk. The company employs a thermochemical process that enables them to develop fat molecules using gases, rather than relying on traditional dairy sources.The livestock industry is responsible for a significant portion of global greenhouse gas emissions , accounting for 14.5 percent according to the United Nations.Reducing the consumption of meat and dairy products is considered one of the essential ways to mitigate the environmental impact of this industry.Savor has said that their products will have a substantially lower carbon footprint compared to their animal-based counterparts.Real butter has a carbon footprint of 16.9kg CO2 equivalent per kg, while the butter created by Savor has a carbon footprint of less than 0.8g CO2 equivalent per kg, highlighting the potential environmental benefits of this innovative approach todairy-free butter production, as reported by The Guardian.Backing this idea on his blogpost, Bill Gates wrote: ""It might sound like a pipe dream, but a company called Savor (which I’m invested in) is in the process of doing it. They started with the fact that all fats are made of varying chains of carbon and hydrogen atoms. Then they set out to make those same carbon and hydrogen chains—without involving animals or plants. They ultimately developed a process that involves taking carbon dioxide from the air and hydrogen from water, heating them up, and oxidizing them to trigger the separation of fatty acids and then the formulation of fat. The result is real fat molecules like the ones we get from milk, cheese, and vegetable oils.""“The process doesn’t release any greenhouse gases, and it uses no farmland and less than a thousandth of the water that traditional agriculture does. And most important, it tastes really good – like the real thing, because chemically it is,” he c.""The idea of switching to lab-made fats and oils may seem strange at first. But their potential to significantly reduce our carbon footprint is immense. By harnessing proven technologies and processes, we get one step closer to achieving our climate goals,"" he added.However the Savor's butter, crafted through innovative techniques, is not yet ready for commercial distribution.Savor's chief executive, Kathleen Alexander said: “We are currently pre-commercial and working through regulatory approval to be able to sell our butter. We are not expecting to be able to move forward with any kind of sales until at least 2025. So far, we had informal taste panels with tens of people.

China making youth unemployment a 'top priority',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/china-making-youth-unemployment-a-top-priority/articleshow/111772468.cms,"'Policy shift under way'

'Lower expectations'

SHANGHAI: At a job fair for soon-to-be graduates in central Shanghai, recruiters sat bored under washed-out tarpaulins as rain and an apparent lack of interest kept potential young employees away.The empty seats belied China's stubbornly high youth unemployment rate -- a problem so pressing that President Xi Jinping has told top Communist Party (CCP) cadres it should be a ""top priority"".His words have been seen by many analysts as a signal that reforms could be in the pipeline ahead of the ongoing Third Plenum, a meeting that has historically unveiled important changes in economic policy direction.Youth unemployment stood at 14.2% in May, official data showed -- and last month, another 11.8 million students graduated from university, adding to the bottleneck.That number had soared to an unprecedented 21.3% in mid-2023 before officials paused publishing monthly figures. They began releasing them again in December after adjusting the calculation method.Hospitality and human resources firms dominated the small job fair in late May, one of many hosted by local authorities in anticipation of an influx of university leavers.""It's difficult to find a job that matches your degree and aspirations,"" one of the few young jobseekers at the fair, a data sciences student, told AFP.""Lots of college students actually have too high expectations,"" said Julia Shao, who was recruiting for a restaurant chain.""They do not prefer this kind of basic position. They prefer... a fancy job.""Xi specifically mentioned graduates in a speech to the CCP Politburo in May, noting that ""more jobs should be created for them to apply what they have learned and what they are adept at"".His remarks follow ""a steady drumbeat of comments from China's leadership underlining the urgency"" of the matter, Erica Tay, director of macro research at Maybank, told AFP.The issue has been hanging over the government for some time.Together with persistently low consumption and a long-running property sector crisis, the unemployment situation has been labelled a key culprit for China's uneven post-pandemic recovery.""While details in Xi's comments are vague, it's clear a policy shift is under way,"" said Harry Murphy Cruise of Moody's Analytics.""We expect policies aimed at reducing youth unemployment to be a key pillar of the discussions (at the Third Plenum).""Xi has said young people should be encouraged ""to find jobs or start businesses in key fields (and) industries"".""Market-oriented and social channels should be expanded for young people to find a job,"" he was quoted as saying.Murphy Cruise said he expected the government to increase wage subsidies to persuade companies to hire recent graduates, as well as create more work placements for students.However, these were only ""band-aid solutions"", he said.In the long term, ""larger industrial and education policy reforms"" were needed to ensure a better match between graduates' skills and employer demands, he said.There is now a push to fill roles that ""dovetail with key policy priorities"" or where skills shortages exist, said Tay, like industrial upgrading and scientific innovation.With job opportunities drying up for those holding sociology, journalism and law degrees, she said, some kind of ""government-sponsored earn-as-you-learn training programmes"" might be needed to fill more in-demand roles.Near the law faculty of a top Shanghai university, final-year students said the job market was indeed tough.""Post-pandemic, it is a little more difficult than before,"" 22-year-old Qian Le said, referencing recent layoffs and pay cuts at top Chinese law firms.""Even those who are already in jobs may not be able to keep them, so it may be more difficult for new people to get in.""Qian and her classmate Wang Hui had both opted to pursue further study.""The economic situation is quite sluggish, many companies have gone bankrupt, and many jobs have been reduced,"" Wang told AFP.China's once-freewheeling private sector has slowed significantly, in part because of past government crackdowns on companies including tech giants and private tutoring firms.Many young people are opting to study for civil service exams -- seen as a more stable option -- or like Wang and Qian, taking on post-graduate degrees.In March, universities urged their students to actively look for jobs instead, said Tay.But ""competition is huge, and the number of undergraduates is gradually increasing every year"", Wang said.Karl Hu, another law student, said the difficulty was not in finding a job.The problem was finding ""a suitable career"" in terms of salary level and benefits, he explained.He himself had secured a good job at a bank, he said -- but many would have to ""lower their expectations"".","Youth unemployment stood at 14.2% in May, official data showed.

"From Elon Musk to David Sacks, Silicon Valley’s Trump backers cheer JD Vance as VP pick",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/from-elon-musk-to-david-sacks-silicon-valleys-trump-backers-cheer-jd-vance-as-vp-pick/articleshow/111768711.cms,"Major Silicon Valley investors hailed Donald Trump ’s choice of Ohio senator and former venture capitalist JD Vance as his running mate, a move that puts the technology industry closer to center stage in Washington if the former president takes the White House in November. Elon Musk called the decision a “great choice” and said the lineup “resounds with victory” on X, the social platform he owns.David Sacks , an investor and Trump supporter scheduled to speak at the GOP convention on Monday night, called Vance an “American patriot” in a post.And at Founders Fund, a venture capital firm backed by billionaire Peter Thiel, partner Delian Asparouhov summed up the mood of many in his orbit, posting: “IT’S JD VANCE. WE HAVE A FORMER TECH VC IN THE WHITE HOUSE. GREATEST COUNTRY ON EARTH BABY.”The Silicon Valley tech industry has long been a liberal bastion nestled in California, a Democratic stronghold, with roots in deeply progressive San Francisco. But a Republican contingent within tech has recently become increasingly visible, with major players like Musk, Sacks and Shaun Maguire from Sequoia Capital throwing their endorsements and donations to Trump for his White House bid against President Joe Biden .Representatives for Thiel and Founders Fund didn’t provide comment on the announcement.After graduating from Yale Law School, Vance in 2016 became a principal at Mithril Capital Management, a venture firm backed by Thiel, where he served a relatively brief stint. In 2017, he joined the Steve Case-backed firm Revolution LLC in Washington, as a partner focusing on startups. In 2019, he moved back to Ohio and formed Narya Capital. Taking a page from Thiel’s book, Vance made a Lord of the Rings reference with his new firm, naming Narya after a ring worn by the wizard Gandalf in the books. Narya was backed by Thiel, alongside other big-name investors including Eric Schmidt and Marc Andreessen.Vance’s proximity to the tech industry has thrilled even former Democrats in tech. One supporter is Chamath Palihapitiya, a former donor to Hillary Clinton who appears alongside Sacks on the tech podcast All In, where the hosts refer to each other as besties. After Trump’s announcement about Vance, he tweeted, “A Bestie adjacent as the VP?!?!?! ????????????????”Crystal McKellar, founder and managing partner of Aloft VC, worked with Vance at Mithril Capital in 2012 and greeted the news enthusiastically.“He will be good for Silicon Valley because he is a good free market capitalist who believes in growth and innovation and eliminating the regulation that strangles growth,” she said in a text. “And he’ll be good for the country for all the same reasons and because he feels genuine compassion for those forgotten and left behind by progress.”Matt Murphy, a partner at Menlo Ventures, said that while he didn’t know Vance, 39, or his positions well, his pick was an encouraging sign. “I think having somebody who understands tech is great,” Murphy said. “We actually have a young candidate who seems to be tech savvy. I think it’s good for the party.”Vance has had a somewhat complicated relationship with Silicon Valley. During his successful campaign for the Senate in 2022, which was backed by Thiel, he was critical of big tech companies, saying that they wield too much power and influence over politics. He argued that his background has positioned him to take on the “big tech oligarchy.”Vance has also cheered the Biden administration’s tech-focused antitrust enforcement, especially Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan. This sets Vance apart from Chamber of Commerce-type Republicans who have consistently criticized Khan’s broad interpretation of existing antitrust law to prosecute tech companies that don’t fit the profile of historic monopolies.“I look at Lina Khan as one of the few people in the Biden administration that I think is actually doing a pretty good job,” Vance said at a conference in February.But while Vance’s criticism of large tech players may rankle some in the industry, it’s similar to sentiments expressed by smaller ones. Startups and venture capitalists have long complained that the size and power of big tech players had made it difficult for small companies to compete. VC firm Andreessen Horowitz has nicknamed the startup world “Little Tech,” and pointed out the difference in priorities between small companies and bigger firms.Vance has also taken on Wall Street in other ways, backing legislation with Elizabeth Warren to claw back pay for bank executives when their institutions fail, and railroad companies with his Trump-endorsed safety bill with Democratic Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown after the East Palestine disaster.He also bucked his party in leading support for the extension of an expired Biden program providing subsidies for broadband access for millions of people. Those bipartisan efforts had earned him plaudits from Democrats but didn’t succeed in getting bills enacted into law.","The Silicon Valley tech industry has long been a liberal bastion nestled in California, with roots in deeply progressive San Francisco.

"Burberry appoints new CEO, warns on profit",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/burberry-appoints-new-ceo-warns-on-profit/articleshow/111757054.cms,"British luxury brand Burberry appointed Joshua Schulman as its new CEO on Monday, replacing Jonathan Akeroyd after a two-year tenure. The change in leadership comes as the brand struggles amid the slowdown in the luxury sector.Additionally, the company also issued a profit warning and suspended its dividend payments.Joshua Schulman previously served as the CEO of the US brand Michael Kors from 2021 to 2022 and held the position of brand president at Coach prior to that.Burberry's underlying sales witnessed 21% decline in the 13 weeks leading up to June 29 as the company acknowledged the deepening weakness in its market.While some high-end luxury brands, such as Hermes and Prada, have demonstrated greater resilience, Burberry has faced challenges. Consumers in the United States and Europe have become more cautious due to rising living costs, while demand in China has been dampened by a property crisis and record-high youth unemployment.Meanwhile, the brand also warned that based on current trends, it would fall short of annual profit forecasts and would forgo this year's dividend to invest in growth initiatives.The British brand has been undergoing a turnaround process for some time, with several leadership changes. Designer Riccardo Tisci departed in 2022 after less than five years, while Akeroyd's predecessor left after four years.""This is a kitchen sink exercise par excellence, and underscores the enormity of the challenge facing Burberry in a world where Chinese sales can no longer be taken for granted,"" said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at online trading platform IG.Burberry announced on Monday that it would realign its offerings to be ""more familiar"" to its ""core customers,"" with a marketing campaign for outerwear set to launch in October. The company's last collection deviated from its classic camel, red, and black check print in favor of bold colors.
