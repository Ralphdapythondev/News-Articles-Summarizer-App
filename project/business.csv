EC mandates publisher identification on political hoardings amid complaints,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ec-mandates-publisher-identification-on-political-hoardings-amid-complaints/articleshow/109199885.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Election Commission on Wednesday told all the states and Union territories to ensure that every print campaign for polls — including hoardings, posters and banners — clearly identifies the name and address of the printer and publisher on its face, in the interest of accountability and transparency.In a letter sent to the chief secretaries and chief electoral officers of all states/UTs, the commission said it had received various representations stating that anonymous hoardings , bearing no detail of the printer or publisher, had been noticed in spaces controlled or regulated by local self governments or municipal authorities.Most of these hoardings were peddling untruthful content or unverified/unsubstantiated allegations about political rivals.EC underlined that the provisions of Representation of the People Act, 1951, and the model code of conduct dealing with campaigning in the print mode, warrant the disclosure of identity of the publisher so that the responsibility of the content can be fixed. Stating that identification of the publisher is linked to the issue of campaign financing and fixing of responsibility in case the content is found unbecoming of the framework of model code of conduct or the statutory scheme, the poll panel said it is also a vital information for the elector.The chief secretaries were accordingly advised to bring its instructions on mandatory disclosure of printer and publisher in printed poll campaigns, “to the notice of all municipal authorities or such authorities that are responsible for hoardings/posters/banners/etc, for strict compliance”At the press conference on March 16 to announce general elections, chief election commissioner Rajeev Kumar had listed misinformation as one of the key challenges, along with money and muscle power, to a level playing field. He had warned people against blindly forwarding/sharing fake news or social media posts. With the latest directive, the Commission has put the accountability on printers, publishers, licensees/contractors of urban local bodies renting out outdoor advertising space, for misleading political advertisements published on outdoor media.Section 127A of the RP Act, 1951 prohibits printing or publishing of election pamphlet/poster without bearing the name and address of the printer and publisher. Section 127A(3)(b) gives wide amplitude to the meaning of the phrase ‘election pamphlet or poster’, to include ‘placard or poster’. “Thus any non-compliances or obfuscations of this requirement are always to be viewed seriously,” EC said on Wednesday.","EC underlined that the provisions of Representation of the People Act, 1951,

5. Important point for salaried individuals:

(Ammu Sadanandhan, Director, People Advisory Services, EY India contributed to the article)

New versus old tax regime: As the new financial year begins, salaried taxpayers across the nation are gearing up to provide income-tax declarations to their employers. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (ITA) requires employers to deduct tax on the estimated salary income of their employees for the financial year.To facilitate this, employees have to intimate the employers of the tax regime that they intend to opt for along with the details of exemptions and deductions to be claimed, if applicable. In case the option is not declared to the employers, the concessional tax regime (CTR) or the new tax regime will be considered as the default tax regime for withholding taxes from the employees’ salary.Resident individuals with total income up to Rs 5,00,000 are eligible for tax rebate under the regular tax regime. For resident individuals opting for the new tax regime, this limit was increased to Rs 7,00,000 effective financial year 2023-24. This means that if individual taxpayers who are resident in India have total income up to Rs 7,00,000 and opt for CTR, they will not have to pay any income-tax.Also Read | Income Tax Rules FY 2024-25: New vs old tax regime - 6 rules salaried individuals should know Further, to ensure that those resident taxpayers whose income is marginally above the said threshold are not adversely affected, marginal relief was also introduced under the CTR for resident individuals whose net taxable income exceeds Rs 7,00,000 marginally and their incremental income-tax liability is higher than the incremental income above Rs 7,00,000.It is now well-known that individual taxpayers have to forego certain exemptions and deductions to avail the benefits of the lower tax rates available under the new income tax regime. While standard deduction, exemptions for gratuity and leave encashment etc. are available under both tax regimes, there are several other commonly claimed exemptions and deductions that are available only under the regular tax regime such as –In contrast, the deduction for employer’s contribution to the National Pension System is the only deduction under Chapter VI-A available to taxpayers under the new tax regime. Hence, it is one of the essential aspects that individual taxpayers with income above Rs 7,00,000 should keep in mind before choosing the tax regime.As mentioned above, the tax benefit on account of lower tax rates under the new tax regime have to be compared with the tax benefit available due to exemptions and deductions under the regular tax regime with higher tax rates. The tax rates under both the regimes for individual taxpayers are given below:Another aspect that is to be considered by high income taxpayers is the difference in the surcharge rates. Surcharge is levied on the income-tax where the taxable income exceeds Rs 50 lakhs. The surcharge rates under both regimes are as below:The maximum surcharge rate is 37% under the regular tax regime for individuals with taxable income above Rs 5 crores. However, the maximum surcharge rate is capped to 25% under the CTR for taxable income above Rs 2 crores. Hence, it is likely to be beneficial for high-salaried taxpayers to opt for the CTR given the reduction in surcharge rate by 12%.Also Read | New Vs Old Tax Regime: How income of even Rs 10 lakh can be tax-free under old tax regime As one can see from the above, employees with income up to Rs 7,00,000 can opt for CTR as it is beneficial for them. Similarly, salaried individuals with income above Rs 5 Crores may also opt for CTR given the surcharge capping at 25%. However, if they have a significant amount of exemptions and deductions to be claimed, the regular regime may become beneficial.It is the salaried taxpayers who fall between these two categories, who will need to clearly assess their estimated tax liability under both the regimes after taking into account the various exemptions and deductions that they may be eligible to claim vis-à-vis the lower tax rates before submitting the declaration to their employers. Nevertheless, irrespective of the tax regime declared to the employer for tax deduction, the salaried taxpayers (without income from business or profession) have an option to switch tax regimes while filing their income-tax return within the prescribed due date.","Salaried employees have to be cognizant of the following key aspects in choosing
the tax regime this financial year. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (ITA) requires
employers to deduct tax on the estimated salary income of their employees.
Salaried individuals should know that taxpayers whose income is marginally above
the said threshold are not adversely affected.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109194353,imgsize-24692,width-400,resizemode-4/109194353.jpg"

Stating that identification of the publisher is linked to the issue of campaign financing and fixing of responsibility in case the content is found unbecoming of the framework of model code of conduct or the statutory scheme, the poll panel said it is also a vital information for the elector.The chief secretaries were accordingly advised to bring its instructions on mandatory disclosure of printer and publisher in printed poll campaigns, “to the notice of all municipal authorities or such authorities that are responsible for hoardings/posters/banners/etc, for strict compliance”At the press conference on March 16 to announce general elections, chief election commissioner Rajeev Kumar had listed misinformation as one of the key challenges, along with money and muscle power, to a level playing field. He had warned people against blindly forwarding/sharing fake news or social media posts. With the latest directive, the Commission has put the accountability on printers, publishers, licensees/contractors of urban local bodies renting out outdoor advertising space, for misleading political advertisements published on outdoor media.Section 127A of the RP Act, 1951 prohibits printing or publishing of election pamphlet/poster without bearing the name and address of the printer and publisher. Section 127A(3)(b) gives wide amplitude to the meaning of the phrase ‘election pamphlet or poster’, to include ‘placard or poster’. “Thus any non-compliances or obfuscations of this requirement are always to be viewed seriously,” EC said on Wednesday.","EC underlined that the provisions of Representation of the People Act, 1951,

Choice screen on iPhones and Android devices

The market share of smaller web browser companies has risen since the European Union’s (EU) Digital Markets Act came into force last month, a report has said, suggesting that the new tech laws are working in favour of players like Aloha Browser, DuckDuckGo, and Brave.Citing data provided by six companies, Reuters reported that independent browser companies in the EU are seeing a spike in users in the first month after EU legislation forced Alphabet's Google , Microsoft and Apple to make it easier for users to switch to rivals.In mobile devices that run Android, Chrome browser comes as default and iPhones have Safari as the default option – making them the dominant browsers in the market.Cyprus-based Aloha Browser said users in the EU jumped 250% in March. It has 10 million monthly average users and earns money through paid subscriptions, rather than selling ads by tracking users.“Before, the EU was our number four market, right now it's number two,” Aloha CEO Andrew Frost Moroz was quoted as saying.Norway's Vivaldi, Germany's Ecosia and US-based Brave have also seen user numbers rise following the new regulation.Meanwhile, US-based DuckDuckGo, which has about 100 million users, and its rival, Norway-based Opera have also reported to have seen growth in users.“We are experiencing record user numbers in the EU right now,” said Jan Standal, vice president at Opera, which counts over 324 million global users.Under the new EU rules, mobile software makers are required to show a choice screen where users can select a browser and search engine as well as virtual assistant when they set up their phones.Reportedly, Apple is now showing up to 11 browsers in addition to Safari in the choice screens curated for each of the 27 countries in the EU, and will update those screens once every year for each country.Google, meanwhile, is currently showing browser choices on devices made by the company. It added that new devices made by other companies running the Android operating system will also display a choice screen in the coming months.","EU's Digital Markets Act came into force last month.

The service, held early in the morning, was attended by a large number of people in the province considered the Taliban's birthplace.Although worshippers did not physically see Akhundzada deliver his speech, a voice over a loudspeaker introduced the sermon as his own words, as reported by an AFP.The mosque courtyard was filled with thousands of people, with strict security measures in place to prevent access to the main worship hall. Akhundzada is known to maintain a low profile, with only one known photograph of him in existence. The press is typically not allowed to cover his public appearances, and Afghan attendees are prohibited from taking photos or videos on their phones.In a previous public appearance in Kandahar during last year's Eid al-Fitr, Akhundzada extended congratulations to Afghans on their ""victory, freedom, and success"".

Embracing artificial intelligence

Jamie Dimon , CEO of JPMorgan, has issued a cautionary message in his annual letter to shareholders, expressing deep concern over global geopolitical tensions and the overly optimistic view of investors on economic threats . Released on Monday, the letter warns that we may be entering one of the most precarious geopolitical times since World War II.Dimon points to ongoing wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, increasing US-China trade tensions, and a resurgence in terrorist attacks as destabilizing factors.He expresses concern over the sharp rise in food and energy prices, the growing possibility of a recession, and volatile markets, which have heightened global fears and uncertainties.""As these events unfold, America’s global leadership role is being challenged outside by other nations and inside by our polarized electorate. We need to find ways to put aside our differences and work in partnership with other Western nations in the name of democracy. During this time of great crises, uniting to protect our essential freedoms, including free enterprise, is paramount,"" Dimon wrote in his letter.The CEO also delved into the issue of persistent inflation, driven by factors such as government deficit spending, the trend towards remilitarization, the restructuring of global supply chains, the costs associated with the transition to green energy, and potential future energy price hikes due to a lack of investment in infrastructure.In the letter,Dimon challenges market predictions that there's a 70% to 80% chance of a 'soft landing' for the US economy, believing the true odds to be much lower. He urges caution against fixating on short-term inflation data or the timing of the next interest rate cut, suggesting that larger forces may have already set long-term rates.Despite these concerns, Dimon is optimistic about the potential of artificial intelligence, which he believes could be as transformative as historic technological advancements like the printing press and the internet. AI's impact has already become a prominent market theme, and JPMorgan is convinced of its extraordinary future consequences.Jamie Dimon's shareholder letter is a sobering reminder of the complex interplay of geopolitical and economic factors shaping the current global environment and the challenges that lie ahead for investors and financial institutions.","Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan, has issued a cautionary message in his annual

Tragically, hopes were dashed as news of his demise surfaced, leaving his family in a state of profound grief.The ordeal took a disturbing turn when Arfath's father, Mohammed Saleem, recounted a harrowing phone call from an unidentified individual claiming Arfath had been abducted by a drug trafficking gang, demanding a ransom of $1,200 for his release. The caller's threats of selling Arfath's organs only compounded the family's anguish.""I got a call from an unknown number, and the caller informed me that my son had been kidnapped and demanded money. The caller did not mention the mode of payment but just asked to pay the amount.

Donald Trump no longer on Bloomberg Billionaires Index,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-no-longer-on-bloomberg-billionaires-index/articleshow/109183522.cms,"NEW DELHI: Trump Media, the parent company behind former President Donald Trump 's social media platform Truth Social , has experienced a significant decline in stock prices, consequently impacting Trump's ranking on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index . The index, which daily ranks the world's 500 richest people, no longer lists Trump following a notable nosedive in Trump Media 's stock price.The company's shares fell 12% on Friday and an additional 8% on Monday, with a further decline of 4.8% on Tuesday before making a slight recovery to close at $37.47, marking an 0.8% increase for the day. However, this was still a more than 50% decrease from its peak in late March. This drastic drop in value occurred after Trump Media merged with Digital World Acquisition Corp, initiating trading under the ticker DJT on March 26, a USA Today report said.This downturn has erased billions from the company’s market valuation , which stood at nearly $8 billion following its market debut. Trump, who owns approximately 60% of Trump Media, equating to 78.75 million shares, saw his stake's value soar to as much as $6 billion post-IPO, briefly earning him a spot on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.As of the latest evaluations, Trump's stake is estimated at closer to $3 billion, significantly affecting his net worth which Forbes pegged at $4.8 billion on Tuesday afternoon, ranking him as the 653rd richest person globally. This estimation falls below the Bloomberg Index's minimum net worth requirement for listing, which was $5.81 billion as of Tuesday.Trump Media's stock has been marked by volatility since its inception, reflecting major fluctuations in Trump's net worth. Despite the company's valuation standing at $5 billion recently, it contrasts starkly with its financial performance in 2023, reporting a loss of over $58 million against a revenue of $4 million.Critics argue that the company is overvalued compared to other social media entities, attributing its inflated value to investments by Trump supporters. An audit firm previously cautioned that Trump Media’s significant operating losses cast doubt on its sustainability. Nevertheless, Trump has vocally defended the company on Truth Social, asserting its solidity and rapid growth, and expressing his confidence in its effectiveness and promising future.(With inputs from agencies)","Trump Media, the parent company behind former President Donald Trump's social

Delta IV Heavy retires after decades of service with secret mission,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/delta-iv-heavy-retires-after-decades-of-service-with-secret-mission/articleshow/109178869.cms,"(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: The US space force and a joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin on Tuesday sent a secret reconnaissance payload into orbit using a Delta IV Heavy rocket . This launch marks the final flight for this renowned launch vehicle, which has served for decades, tallying nearly 400 missions since its inception in 1960.The rocket, managed by United Launch Alliance (ULA), lifted off from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida at approximately 1pm EDT (1700 GMT).This launch comes after a 12-day delay due to a technical issue encountered during a previous attempt. Standing at approximately 23 stories tall, the Delta IV Heavy ascended into the sky amidst partly cloudy conditions, as seen in a live webcast by ULA.The mission aimed to deploy a satellite for the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), a classified operation known as NROL-70. Hours later, the Space Force confirmed the successful placement of the payload into orbit. Originating from a modified ballistic missile, these rockets have played crucial roles in space missions since the 1960s, with a total of 389 launches.Some of the achievements of the Delta rockets include launching the world's first weather and GPS satellites, as well as numerous NASA missions, such as sending spacecraft to Mars. Among these missions were the launches of the Mars rovers Spirit and Opportunity in 2003 and the Parker Solar Probe in 2018.Tony Bruno, the president and CEO of ULA, emphasised the pivotal role of the Delta rocket saying, ""The Delta rocket played a pivotal role in the evolution of space flight since the 1960s.""Moving forward, ULA plans to retire the Delta and Atlas rockets in favor of its newly developed Vulcan rocket. Despite a recent setback where the payload malfunctioned before reaching the moon, the Vulcan rocket showcased a successful inaugural flight earlier this year.The Atlas V, another ULA rocket, still had 17 missions scheduled before its planned retirement. The Delta IV Heavy, weighing 1.6 million pounds when fully fueled, consists of a triple-booster lower stage and a single-engine upper stage. During Tuesday's flight, key stages separated as planned, culminating in the jettisoning of cargo panels protecting the NROL-70 payload.The exact nature and objectives of the NROL-70 mission remain classified. In a statement preceding the launch, the US government mentioned the mission's aim to enhance the NRO's capabilities. ""Strengthen the NRO's ability to provide a wide range of timely intelligence information to national decision makers, warfighters and intelligence analysts,"" the statement said.","The US space force and a joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin on

"Arizona can enforce an 1864 law criminalizing nearly all abortions, court says",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/arizona-can-enforce-an-1864-law-criminalizing-nearly-all-abortions-court-says/articleshow/109177672.cms,"PHOENIX: Arizona will soon join 14 other states that have banned abortion at all stages of pregnancy, a change triggered by a state Supreme Court ruling Tuesday that found officials may enforce an 1864 law criminalizing all abortions except when a woman's life is at stake.The court said enforcement won't begin for at least two weeks. The law provides no exceptions for rape or incest.The number of abortions in the state is expected to drop from about 1,100 monthly - as estimated by a survey for the Society of Family Planning - to nearly zero. The forecast is based on what has happened in other states that ban abortion at all stages of pregnancy.Arizona Sen. Eva Burch, who has had an abortion since announcing on the Senate floor last month that she was seeking one because her pregnancy wasn't viable, criticized GOP lawmakers who back the ban.""The fight for reproductive rights is not over in Arizona,"" she said, referring to a statewide petition campaign to put the issue on the ballot this fall. ""This moment must not slow us down.""According to AP VoteCast, six of 10 Arizona voters in the 2022 midterm elections said they would favor guaranteeing access to legal abortion nationwide.Planned Parenthood officials vowed to continue providing abortions for the short time they are still legal and said they will reinforce networks that help women travel out of state to places like New Mexico and California to access abortion.""Even with today's ruling, Planned Parenthood Arizona will continue to provide abortion through 15 weeks for a very short period of time,"" said Angela Florez, president of the organization's Arizona chapter.Brittany Crawford, a 34-year-old mother of three who owns a hair salon in Phoenix, said the high court's ruling could have far-reaching consequences.""You are going to have a lot of desperate girls doing whatever they can to get rid of their babies,"" said Crawford. ""Some could end up dead.""She herself had an abortion at 18, right out of high school, and said she suffered extreme emotional trauma.""I still think I should have the right to decide whether I do have a child, or whether I don't have a child,"" she said. Nevertheless, the Center for Arizona Policy, a longtime backer of anti-abortion proposals before the Legislature, said the state's highest court reached the appropriate conclusion. ""Today's outcome acknowledges the sanctity of all human life and spares women the physical and emotional harms of abortion,"" the group said in a statement.Nearly every state ban on abortions has been challenged with a lawsuit. Courts have blocked enforcing some restrictions, including prohibitions throughout pregnancy in Utah and Wyoming.The Arizona ruling suggests doctors can be prosecuted for performing the procedure and the 1864 law carries a sentence of two to five years in prison for doctors or anyone else who assists in an abortion.""In light of this Opinion, physicians are now on notice that all abortions, except those necessary to save a woman's life, are illegal,"" the Arizonal Supreme Court said in its decision, adding that additional criminal and regulatory sanctions may apply to abortions performed after 15 weeks.Jill Gibson, chief medical officer at Planned Parenthood Arizona, said that means legal considerations are now likely to weigh heavily on any decision about abortion.""It just creates this environment that makes it really impossible for a physician to understand her risk in taking care of her patients,"" Gibson said. ""Rather than, you know, making clinical decisions based on what my patients are telling me, I will be phoning my lawyers for guidance on what I can do.""Since the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, most Republican-controlled states have started enforcing new bans or restrictions and most Democrat-dominated ones have sought to protect abortion access. Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich, a Republican, persuaded a state judge in Tucson to lift a restriction on enforcing the state's 1864 law. Brnovich's Democratic successor, Attorney General Kris Mayes, had urged the state's high court to hold the line against it.""Today's decision to reimpose a law from a time when Arizona wasn't a state, the Civil War was raging, and women couldn't even vote will go down in history as a stain on our state,"" Mayes said Tuesday.Former Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey, a Republican who signed the state's current law restricting abortion after 15 weeks, posted on X saying that the state Supreme Court's ruling was not the outcome he would have wanted.""I signed the 15-week law as governor because it is thoughtful policy, and an approach to this very sensitive issue that Arizonans can actually agree on,"" he said.","Arizona will soon join 14 other states that have banned abortion at all stages

Muhammad Aurangzeb: From JPMorgan to Pakistan’s finance minister with no pay,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/muhammad-aurangzeb-from-jpmorgan-to-pakistans-finance-minister-with-no-pay/articleshow/109147941.cms,"Seats of power

Fresh face

Pakistan’s new finance minister is on a mission to fix his country. To many, it’s an unenviable task.Muhammad Aurangzeb took up the post last month at a time when Pakistan’s economy is enduring the most turbulent period in its history.Lurching from one bailout program to the next with the International Monetary Fund classifying its debt as only borderline sustainable, Pakistan has Asia’s fastest inflation, anemic growth, and one of the lowest tax-collection rates in the world.As a prominent banker and JPMorgan Chase & Co alumnus, Aurangzeb comes as well equipped as any of his predecessors to face the challenge. But that’s to disregard an array of extra factors affecting the role which are outside his control, including volatile domestic politics, tensions with neighbors India, Afghanistan and Iran, and a catastrophic position on the front line of climate change.“Broadly, the finance minister’s job is to manage and steer the economy,” said Mosharraf Zaidi, a former government adviser and founder of policy think tank Tabadlab based in Pakistan’s capital, Islamabad. “It seems simple when framed this way. In fact, it is one of the most complex jobs on the planet.”Among the most immediate of his tasks is to seal a deal by June with the IMF for a minimum three year program worth at least $6 billion. Key objectives in the negotiations for the fund will include broadening the tax base, improving debt sustainability and restoring viability to the energy sector — all steps that Pakistan has avoided for decades.Aurangzeb cites a shared sense of urgency with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, who was elected to a second successive term in March. “He’s a person who wants to get things done,” he said of Sharif in an interview in his ministry in Islamabad.“This is the time to actually capitalize on that mandate and ensure that all the tough decisions that need to be taken are taken now,” said Aurangzeb. The alternative would be “a huge missed opportunity that we can ill afford.”“We should consult with everyone, we should try to build a consensus, but a few things we’ll just have to bite the bullet and do it,” he said.Hailing from a prominent family in Lahore — his father was Pakistan’s attorney general — Aurangzeb, 59, went to the nation’s elite Aitchison College then studied at Wharton on a scholarship before working at Citigroup Inc. in New York early in his career.He returned to Pakistan to work at a unit of ABN Amro Bank NV, later shifting to the bank’s headquarters in Amsterdam. In 2018, he again accepted a move back to his home country when he left JPMorgan in Singapore to take over as chief executive officer of Pakistan’s largest lender, Habib Bank Ltd, just after it had been fined $225 million and forced to end its US operations for weak anti-money-laundering controls and sanctions compliance.At the time, his return to Pakistan surprised those he worked with, since he was seen to be leaving the comfort of Singapore and a cushy role at JPMorgan for a post that few considered a dream job, according to a former colleague.Aurangzeb would often speak about his love for the country of his birth and the elevation to finance minister is seen as evidence of his commitment to the nation, the person said, asking not to be named discussing personal decisions.Married with two adult children, Aurangzeb — also known as Auri — was a member of the prime minister’s economic advisory council in 2022 during Sharif’s previous term, a role that gave him an inside view of the premier’s management style. He was tapped for the finance post a few weeks before the election, flying from his base in the commercial capital Karachi to meet with Sharif multiple times before accepting the offer.“It’s a huge privilege,” he said. “But then it comes with a set of expectations.”His ministry sits close to the Margalla hills that bound the capital to the north, a 20 minute walk from the prime minister’s office, with the national assembly midway between the two seats of government power. A recent introduction to his office is a large television with split screens showing stock market prices, economic indicators, and Bloomberg TV.Aurangzeb was one of the highest paid corporate leaders in Pakistan before joining the government. Now, in line with other cabinet members, he’s not drawing a salary. He also renounced his Dutch citizenship to become eligible for the post.What he describes as “national service” will mean reaching tough decisions under the toughest IMF program in years if he and Sharif are to bring the economy back from the brink. These include putting a stop to accumulating more state losses by raising energy prices and selling state-owned companies, unpopular choices that will inevitably trigger pushback from powerful business lobbies and stoke public anger — a chief reason they’ve been avoided to date.Aurangzeb will approach the challenge as a political outsider. He is not part of Sharif’s political party, and was appointed in a technocratic capacity. Sharif leads a shaky coalition whose two main allies have said they will support the government on a case-by-case basis only.There have already been attempts to contain Aurangzeb’s role. Sharif decided to chair the Economic Coordination Committee, a top policy-making forum that is usually headed by the finance minister, before backtracking a day later after public criticism.Foreign minister Ishaq Dar — a veteran politician who served four separate stints as finance minister until he was shunted sideways by Sharif — has been installed as head of a privatization committee that would normally have been led by Aurangzeb or the minister for privatization.With ministers routinely swapped out and back in again, his is the first fresh face at the finance ministry in six years. Finance ministers are regularly blamed for Pakistan’s economic woes, and there have been more than 10 in the past decade; Sharif had two in his previous 16-month tenure.Aurangzeb is clear that his key challenge is the economy and not politics. For all his corporate experience, he says he’s focused on Pakistan’s future rather than dwelling on his past achievements.“You have to push yourself,” he said. “You have to get out of your comfort zone.”","Muhammad Aurangzeb took up the post last month at a time when Pakistan’s economy

Pakistan is reportedly preparing to initiate the second phase of expelling Afghan migrants starting April 10, following the removal of 535,000 individuals since November last year.Abdul Rahman Rashid, a deputy in the Afghan-Taliban Ministry of Migrants, made this plea during a meeting with Junaid Waziri, the Charge d'Affaires of the Pakistani Embassy in Kabul, emphasizing the bilateral nature of immigration decisions.In a recent meeting at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Kabul, attended by diplomats and representatives from various nations, Abdul Salam Hanafi, Deputy Prime Minister of the Taliban, stated that over a million Afghan migrants had been expelled from neighboring countries.Amnesty International has urged the immediate cancellation of the plan to expel Afghan migrants from Pakistan, citing violations of international human rights laws.James Jennion from TOLOnews expressed disappointment in the Pakistani government's decision to extend the deportation drive to Afghan Citizen Card holders, highlighting the potential risks Afghan refugees face in a Taliban-controlled Afghanistan.Afghan migrants in Pakistan are anxious about the upcoming second phase of expulsions, raising concerns about police treatment and uncertainty about their future. The first phase of expelling undocumented Afghan migrants commenced in November 2023, with the 'repatriation plan' including citizens as well set to begin on April 10.Despite criticism from human rights organizations and Afghanistan, the Pakistani government defends its actions, asserting that the measures are not aimed at any specific ethnic group.","The acting minister of Refugees and Repatriation Affairs for the Taliban has

"Peter Higgs, Nobelist who found 'God Particle', dies",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/peter-higgs-nobelist-who-found-god-particle-dies/articleshow/109174387.cms,"Peter Higgs , who predicted the existence of a new particle that came to be named after him (as well as God) and sparked a half-century, worldwide, billion-dollar search for it culminating in champagne in 2012 and a Nobel Prize a year later, died on Monday. He was 94. His death was announced by the University of Edinburgh , where he was an emeritus professor.No further details were provided. Dr Higgs lived in Edinburgh.Higgs was a 35-year-old assistant professor at the university in 1964 when he suggested the existence of a new particle that would explain how other particles acquire mass. The Higgs boson , also known as ""the God particle "", would become the keystone of a suite of theories known as the Standard Model, which encapsulated all human knowledge so far about elementary particles and the forces by which they shaped nature and the universe.A half-century later, on July 4, 2012, he received a standing ovation as he walked into a lecture hall at the European Organisation for Nuclear Research, or CERN, in Geneva and heard that his particle had finally been found. On a webcast from the laboratory, the whole world watched him pull out a handkerchief and wipe away a tear. ""It's really an incredible thing that it's happened in my lifetime,"" he said.Declining to stick around for the after-parties, Higgs flew right back home, celebrating on the plane with a can of London Pride beer. CERN, which has shelves of empty Champagne bottles commemorating great moments lining its control room, asked if it could have the can, but Higgs had already thrown it away.Higgs was born in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, England, in May 29, 1929. His interest in physics was tweaked when he was attending the same school, Cotham Grammar School, as had Paul Dirac, the great British theorist who was one of the fathers of quantum mechanics. That theory, which describes the forces of nature as a game of catch between force-carrying bits of energy called bosons, would be the same field in which Higgs would rise to fame.After temporary research posts at the University of Edinburgh, Imperial College London and University College London, he took a permanent job as a lecturer at Edinburgh in 1960. At Edinburgh, he redirected his research from chemistry and molecules to his first love, elementary particles.The boson became a big deal in 1967 when Steven Weinberg, of the University of Texas in Austin, made it the linchpin in unifying the weak and electromagnetic forces. It became an even bigger deal in 1971, when the Belgian theorist Gerardus't Hooft proved that the whole scheme made mathematical sense. Higgs said Benjamin Lee, a physicist who later died in a car crash, christened it the Higgs boson during a conference in about 1972, perhaps because Higgs's paper was cited first in Weinberg's paper.The name stuck, not just to the particle, but to the molasses field that produced it and the mechanism by which that field gave mass to other particles - somewhat to the embarrassment of Higgs and the annoyance of the other theorists. He cringed every time the term ""Higgs boson"" was used in his presence. But as a life-long atheist, he disliked the ""God particle"" even more.","Peter Higgs predicted the existence of a new particle that came to be named

LONDON: A new report is calling for colonial-era paintings in the foreign office’s Whitehall headquarters to be removed and for the department’s name to be changed from what it describes as “somewhat elitist and rooted in the past”.A group of former diplomats, ministers, national security advisers, and senior officials have written the report, “The World in 2040: Renewing the UK's Approach to International Affairs”, in collaboration with the UCL Policy Lab and Hertford College, Oxford.It was not commissioned by the UK govt.""The very name of the Foreign, Commonwealth (formerly ‘Colonial’) and Development Office (FCDO) is anchored in the past,” the report states. “A new Department for International Affairs (or Global Affairs UK) would signal a potentially quite different role. Former colonies are making increasingly vocal demands around the need for reparations from colonialism and compensation for damage arising from historical industrial emissions. UK has often sought to project an image of ‘greatness’ to the world that today seems anachronistic. We should give space, be more of a ‘team-player’, showing humility and respect,” it states.Britain will no longer be able to rely on its traditional alliances with the US and Europe and, instead, the countries in the G20 should be a core focus, it says, since UK will “have to share rights in multilateral institutions with emerging powers” now that the world’s economic gravity is moving back towards the East driven by growth in China, India and Southeast Asia.“Today, the UK is undoubtedly less politically and economically influential than in the immediate aftermath of the Second World War. This trend is likely to continue,” it says. “Western values and dominance of the international order are being challenged by countries with differing political and value systems.”The report describes the UK as ""an ‘offshore’ mid-sized power.” While in the past the UK compared itself to France and Germany, its future has more in common with Japan, Canada, Norway and Switzerland, it states.Downing Street has rejected the report with UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak saying he did not agree the FCDO was ""elitist"", nor that colonial-era paintings should be removed, and that he was proud of the UK’s history.An FCDO spokesperson said: “We are committed to having an even greater impact and influence on the world stage.”","A new report is calling for colonial-era paintings in the foreign office’s

New York to London in 3.5 hours? This supersonic jet may redefine fast travel,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/new-york-to-london-in-3-5-hours-this-supersonic-jet-may-redefine-fast-travel/articleshow/109127925.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a groundbreaking advancement for aviation, a demonstrator aircraft, heralding what might be the first civil supersonic plane since the 1960s, successfully soared through its first test flight earlier this month. This event marks a pivotal milestone in the eagerly awaited resurgence of supersonic travel.The aircraft, named XB-1, was developed by Colorado-based Boom Supersonic and completed its initial test flight at California's Mojave Air & Space Port, announced on March 22.The XB-1 is celebrated as the world’s first independently developed supersonic jet and serves as a precursor to Boom’s Overture, the commercial plane in development, a CNN report said.Blake Scholl , CEO of Boom Supersonic, shared his vision with CNN Travel, saying, “I very much believe in the return of supersonic air travel, and ultimately to bring it to every passenger on every route. And that’s not something that takes place overnight.” He emphasized the challenges of designing a sleek and efficient supersonic jet capable of safe takeoff and landing.During its debut flight, the XB-1 achieved all its test objectives, reaching an altitude of 7,120 feet (2,170 meters) and speeds up to 238 knots (273 miles per hour), which is below the typical altitudes of commercial airliners but a significant step towards achieving supersonic speeds.Scholl revealed plans for a series of flights over the next five to seven months aimed at breaking the sound barrier, an achievement that has been elusive since the era of the Soviet Tupolev Tu-144 and the British-French Concorde, which last flew in October 2003.The aviation industry is currently buzzing with supersonic and hypersonic projects, such as Nasa and Lockheed Martin's ""quiet"" X-59 aircraft and Atlanta-based Hermeus, which recently unveiled its first flyable aircraft. Scholl attributes the revival of supersonic flight to advancements in digital engineering, aerodynamics, materials, and propulsion.The XB-1, constructed primarily from carbon fiber composites, employs an innovative augmented reality vision system for landing, eliminating the need for a movable nose, which was a notable feature of the Concorde.With the aviation industry aiming for net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, Boom’s Overture is designed to run on up to 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), addressing the current challenges of SAF's availability and cost. Scholl is optimistic about SAF becoming the future of aviation, emphasizing the importance of balancing speed and sustainability.Scholl's vision extends beyond immediate advancements, aiming for a future where supersonic flights are more affordable, efficient, and accessible, aligning with his dream of enabling people to ""fly anywhere in the world in four hours for $100."" Boom Supersonic aims to carry its first passengers on Overture, boasting speeds of Mach 1.7, before the end of the decade, with an impressive order book from notable airlines.As Boom Supersonic prepares to open its super-factory in Greensboro, North Carolina, later this year, Scholl anticipates 2024 as a pivotal year for supersonic flight, envisioning a future where supersonic planes replace conventional jets, making air travel faster, more sustainable, and widely accessible, the CNN report said.","Aircraft, named XB-1, completed its initial test flight at California's Mojave

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: English centenarian John Alfred Tinniswood crowned world's oldest man at 111 John Alfred Tinniswood, a 111-year-old Englishman from Southport, northwest England, has officially been named the world's oldest living man by Guinness World Records. This recognition comes after the passing of the previous record holder, Juan Vicente Pérez of Venezuela, at the age of 114, and Gisaburo Sonobe from Japan, who died on March 31 at 112.Tinniswood attributes his remarkable longevity to a combination of luck, moderation , and a weekly indulgence in fish and chips.Born on August 26, 1912, in Liverpool, shortly after the Titanic tragedy, Tinniswood has witnessed over a century of history, including two World Wars, serving in the British Army Pay Corps during World War II.The retired accountant and great-grandfather emphasizes a life of moderation as the key to health. ""If you drink too much or you eat too much or you walk too much — if you do too much of anything — you’re going to suffer eventually,"" Tinniswood shared with Guinness World Records. Despite his disciplined lifestyle, he believes longevity ultimately boils down to chance: ""It’s pure luck. You either live long or you live short, and you can’t do much about it.""Currently residing in a care home in Southport, Tinniswood enjoys a quiet life filled with reading newspapers, listening to the radio, and supporting Liverpool football club. His long-standing support has seen him celebrate all nineteen of Liverpool's league title wins and eight FA Cup victories. Care home manager Katie Howard describes Tinniswood as ""an amazing individual with so many stories to tell.""The title of the world's oldest woman and the oldest living person is held by 117-year-old Maria Branyas Morera of Spain. Tinniswood's recognition not only celebrates his individual milestone but also highlights the incredible stories and experiences of those who have lived through more than a century of global events.","John Alfred Tinniswood, 111, has officially been named the world's oldest living
