They highlighted ongoing investment monetization and identified new energy cash flow streams set to begin by the end of 2024 as the next significant event to watch. Morgan Stanley does not anticipate any further tariff hikes until FY27 but suggested that an additional 20% tariff increase within the next year could boost earnings by 10-15%.The global brokerage firm has rated RIL as 'overweight' with a target price of Rs 3,046.Jefferies noted Jio's tariff hikes ranged between 13-25% and subsequently reduced Jio's FY25-27 estimates by up to 3%.

Infosys & Wipro see sharp decline in number of employees earning over Rs 1 crore,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/infosys-wipro-see-sharp-decline-in-number-of-employees-earning-over-rs-1-crore-heres-why/articleshow/111275702.cms,"Paycheck at IT companies

Number of crorepati employees at Indian IT companies dips! The number of employees earning over Rs 1 crore at India's leading IT companies, Infosys and Wipro , has significantly decreased over the past two fiscal years. This decline is attributed to the slowdown in demand for technology services following the pandemic.The post-pandemic surge in demand for digital services had initially led to a fierce talent war, with companies like Infosys, Wipro, TCS, and HCLTech offering substantial salary increases to attract the best talent.However, this talent war quickly subsided due to global macroeconomic uncertainty and geopolitical tensions.According to an ET report, Infosys experienced a nearly 16% reduction in crorepati employees, with the number dropping from 123 in FY22 to 103 at the end of FY24. Similarly, Wipro saw a 12% decrease, with the number of crorepati employees falling from 92 in FY22 to 81 in FY24.Industry experts believe that this decline in high-earning employees at top IT exporters is a result of the reset across the $250 billion IT industry, which is currently facing one of the most challenging demand environments in recent years.In the financial year 2024, Infosys witnessed an addition of 12 employees earning over Rs 1 crore annually. Notably, these high earners were among the 1,400 IT staff transferred from Danske Bank to the Bengaluru-based firm following an outsourcing agreement in September of the previous year. Interestingly, Infosys itself did not directly hire any employees with a yearly compensation exceeding Rs 1 crore in fiscal 2024, marking the first such instance since FY17.On the other hand, Wipro onboarded eight employees with salaries of Rs 1 crore or more throughout the fiscal year 2024. The company's annual report, released on Monday, revealed that more than 60% of its workforce had been hired in the past three years. This highlights the significant talent turnover experienced during the tenure of former CEO Thierry Delaporte, which came to an unexpected end in April 2024, a year before his five-year term was set to conclude.Among the senior executives who departed from Wipro during FY24 were former CFO Jatin Dalal and former chief growth officer Stephanie Trautman, along with other key personnel.Also Read | Infosys announces up to Rs 8 lakh incentive package for employees open to transfer to Hubballi campus It is important to note that the number of crorepati employees listed in the annual reports of Infosys and Wipro only includes those who were posted in India during FY24 and have drawn their salary for the full fiscal year. This number does not account for employees who joined or resigned mid-year and were employed by these companies for only a portion of the year.Additionally, experts highlight the impact of the rapid growth in global capability centres (GCCs) on the talent profile of India's leading software exporters.The Indian IT industry is witnessing a significant shift in leadership talent, with many executives moving to midcap companies and Global Capability Centers (GCCs) in pursuit of top leadership positions, particularly CEO roles. Munira Loliwala, vice president for business strategy and growth at TeamLease Digital, a staffing firm, highlighted this trend, stating, ""A lot of leadership talent has, of late, switched to midcaps (IT companies) and GCCs in India, largely to become CEOs or as part of the top leadership.""Also Read | Why IT majors like Cognizant, Infosys, HCLTech are acquiring engineering services companies However, the industry is also facing challenges due to a slowdown in demand, which has forced companies to reduce hiring as they grapple with pressure on both margins and growth. Loliwala noted, ""Due to the continuing softness in demand, companies which are pressured on both margins and growth front have put brakes on hiring."" Consequently, five out of the six largest Indian IT services firms have experienced a decrease in their headcounts during the fiscal year 2024.The combined headcount reduction for these top six companies amounts to nearly 75,000 employees, a situation that is unprecedented for an industry that was once considered a bellwether. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), the industry leader, saw its headcount decline by 13,249 in FY24, while Infosys and Wipro recorded drops of 25,994 and 24,516, respectively, during the same period. HCLTech stood out as the only exception, with a modest increase of 1,537 in its headcount.",The number of employees earning over Rs 1 crore at India's leading IT companies has significantly decreased over the past two fiscal years.

Standard deduction may rise under new tax regime,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/standard-deduction-may-rise-under-new-tax-regime/articleshow/111212512.cms,"NEW DELHI: The finance ministry is assessing the possibility of raising the standard deduction limit for income taxpayers under the new regime, without tinkering with the exemption-laced older regime.Besides, as the NDA govt readies to present its first Budget of its third term, it is unlikely to undertake major tweaks in capital gains mechanism, an issue on which the income tax department has been seeking a review.There have been suggestions to align the holding period across asset classes but govt may not be inclined to disturb the system, at least for the moment.While discussions on the contours of the Budget have just begun with finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman undertaking public consultations, most of the exercise is currently limited to the finance ministry and internal assessment is being undertaken on multiple issues some of which will be discussed with other wings of govt before the finance ministry takes a final call, based on feedback from the PMO.The overall mood indicates that most wings of govt are in favour of offering concessions to taxpayers, especially the middle class, which has been a supporter of the Modi regime but is increasingly raising questions about the returns it gets for the tax it pays, be it through public healthcare or education.In the 2023 Budget, FM had introduced a standard deduction of Rs 50,000 for salaried taxpayers and those who earn pension under the new tax regime, which became the default option, unless you opted out. Also, rebate under Section 87A was increased under the new tax regime for taxable incomes not exceeding Rs 7 lakh, allowing those earning up to this level (taxable income) to not pay any tax under the new regime. The highest surcharge under the new regime was also removed.Currently, individuals with a taxable income of upwards of Rs 3 lakh have to pay 5% income tax and there have been suggestions from industry leaders to tweak the rates in the higher brackets to boost consumption. A higher standard deduction will benefit all the salaried taxpayers, including those in the upper segment although it will entail some revenue loss.","The finance ministry is assessing the possibility of raising the standard deduction limit for income taxpayers under the new regime.

Relief for taxpayers soon? ‘Faceless' income tax assessment mechanism to be made friendlier,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/relief-for-taxpayers-soon-faceless-income-tax-assessment-mechanism-to-be-made-friendlier/articleshow/111281170.cms,"Income Tax Assessment

Income Tax Assessment mechanism to be more taxpayer friendly? The Indian government is currently evaluating the 'faceless' income tax (I-T) assessment system to enhance its taxpayer-friendliness, based on recommendations for improving the program's effectiveness.Introduced on April 1, 2021, the scheme was designed to minimize human interaction in tax disputes and assessments.Under this system, the income tax department handles return processing, refund issuance, tax assessments , scrutiny, and appeal management. Cases are randomly assigned to assessing officers, irrespective of geographical jurisdiction.Sources familiar with the matter told ET that a hybrid approach is under consideration, which would allow taxpayers to choose between the faceless scheme and in-person resolution. ""It is being reviewed to assess effectiveness,"" an official was quoted as saying. He also said that making it optional for taxpayers is a potential solution.Another official mentioned that the aim is to tackle implementation challenges and further simplify compliance for taxpayers. The final decision will be made soon, the official added.Although the video conferencing-based assessment system is considered stable, there has been an increasing demand from both individual and business taxpayers to allow some level of in-person interaction. Additionally, the income tax department's field formations have been advocating for a more hybrid approach to ensure optimal and effective resource utilization.Assessing taxes is a multifaceted process, and experts believe that interactive communication between the taxpayer and the tax officer can lead to more effective outcomes.Also Read | Form 26 AS: Filing Income Tax Return?

Prediction of a good monsoon - which often translates into availability of cash for people employed with the farming sector or adjacent industries - is also expected to help consumption .To be sure, some green shoots of consumption were visible towards the end of the March quarter, as indicated by companies, but a full recovery in demand is awaited. The slowdown in spending is more pronounced in lower (includes lower middle class) income households, impacting the mass segment, while premium continues to fare well.The mass segment, weighed down by economic pressures , is displaying ""cautious spending behaviours"" and is recovering at a slower pace, Joy Alukkas, chairman and managing director of Joyalukkas Group told TOI. ""The biggest requirement in the market is for the bottom of the pyramid to come in and spend,"" said Kumar Rajagopalan, CEO at Retailers Association of India (RAI). Demand has remained flat in the current quarter and most retailers are worried because they had planned for a much bigger growth, he added.The industry, analysts said, will also be closely watching for consumption-favourable announcements in the upcoming Budget. Within middle-income households, those earning between Rs 5-8 lakh annually seem to be more strained financially, industry executives indicated.""FY25... things may improve but it is good if we plan that the uptick is gradual. Maybe we are also looking at a good monsoon, good industrial output, agricultural output... so, these are all good things which should help us to boost demand in the later part of the year,"" V S Ganesh, managing director at Page Industries (exclusive licensee of the Jockey brand in India), said in the company's Q4 earnings call.A recent study by Deloitte India showed that about 32% of the 660 respondents surveyed intended to reduce their spending on apparel and footwear in the next 12 months. Accessories like watches and jewellery saw the lowest percentage of respondents intending to increase their purchase frequency. While adequate wardrobes, financial constraints and minimalist lifestyle choices all dictate the cohort's spending preferences, 30% of respondents cited financial constraints to be the key reason for a lesser likelihood of spending on consumer durables.""The big risk is that the mass segment does not revive as quickly as expected in the near term and we have continued pressure on volume growth, while the premium segment also remains sluggish with consumers feeling that their needs have already been met by past purchases,"" Anand Ramanathan, partner and consumer products & retail sector leader at Deloitte India, said about the near-term challenges to consumption.Paritosh Tiwari, head of retail at Raymond Lifestyle Business, said that the company saw an uptick in consumer spending in Q4, but which dwindled significantly in Q1 largely on account of fewer wedding dates.

Budget 2024 income tax expectations : Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is expected to present the first full Union Budget 2024 of the Modi 3.0 government in July. Like every year, salaried individuals are looking at FM Sitharaman to provide tax relief in the form of reduced tax rates, changed income tax slabs and even higher deductions.One such relief that is sought is to include more non-metro cities in the 50% House Rent Allowance (HRA) exemption list.HRA is a common component of employee compensation packages provided by many employers.Employees receiving HRA and paying rent for their accommodation can claim a tax exemption on the allowance under the old income tax regime. The exemption amount depends on whether the employee resides in a metro city or not for tax purposes. However, if an employee receiving HRA does not live in a rented house, the entire allowance becomes fully taxable.According to an ET report quoting Radhika Viswanathan, Executive Director at Deloitte Haskins & Sells LLP, the Income-tax Act, 1961, under Section 10(13A), provides tax exemption for HRA. The amount of HRA that can be claimed as tax exempt is the lowest of the following:1. Actual HRA received;2. Actual Rent paid minus 10% of basic salary;3. 50% of basic salary (for metro cities)/40% of basic salary (for non-metro cities).Also Read | Budget 2024 income tax expectations: Modi government may lower personal tax rates, says report - top 5 points Currently, rented houses in Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, and Chennai are eligible for a 50% exemption from HRA, while those in other locations fall under the 40% category. It is important to note that this classification was established over three decades ago, according to Viswanathan.As cities have expanded in terms of population and economic growth, it has become necessary to re-evaluate the way we define metro and non-metro cities.Interestingly, the Constitution (seventy-fourth Amendment) Act, 1992, also recognizes the National Capital Region (NCR), Bangalore, Pune, Hyderabad as metro cities. Despite this, the HRA tax exemption for salaried individuals in these cities remains at 40% due to outdated tax laws.Also Read | Standard deduction may rise under new tax regime Residing outside of metro cities can result in a higher proportion of one's income being paid in taxes. For instance, an individual living in Bengaluru may have to pay a higher average rent compared to someone residing in Kolkata or Chennai, which are classified as metro cities for tax purposes.Those living in rapidly developing non-metro cities, as defined by the Income-tax Act, may pay higher rents due to rapid urbanization. But, they receive lower tax benefits for house rent compared to metro cities. With an increasing number of people relocating to these non-metro cities for employment, it is crucial for the government to reassess the regulations for claiming rent exemptions to alleviate the financial strain on taxpayers, feel experts.",Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is expected to present the first full Union Budget 2024 of the Modi 3.0 government in July.

The sources told Reuters that a reduction in personal tax could boost consumption and increase savings for the middle class. The first source mentioned that individuals earning over Rs 15 lakh ($17,960.42) annually, up to a certain undetermined amount, may receive some tax relief.

The changes could be made to the new income tax regime introduced in 2020, where annual income up to Rs 15 lakh is taxed at rates between 5% and 20%, while earnings over Rs 15 lakh are taxed at 30%.

The second source pointed out that the personal tax rate increases six-fold when an individual's income rises from Rs 300,000 to Rs 15 lakh, which they described as ""quite steep.""

The government may also consider lowering personal tax rates for annual incomes of Rs 10 lakh, according to the first source. They added that a new threshold is being discussed for income taxed at the highest rate of 30% under the old tax system.

The second source noted that any loss of tax income to the government through tax cuts could be partially offset by increased consumption from this category of income earners.

The finance minister set the stage for a ""Viksit Bharat by 2047"", on the core principles of ‘Sabka Saath’, ‘Sabka Vikas’, ‘Sabka Vishwas’, with ‘Sabka Prayas’ being added as a new theme in the interim Budget.This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data i.e., farmer welfare and N for Nari utthan i.e., support for women entrepreneurs. These form the pillars of a comprehensive inclusive development. The Government's commitment to sustainable development under the strategy for Amrit Kaal includes achieving 'Net Zero' by 2070, rooftop solarization for one crore households and robust health initiatives.The Indian economy's resilience takes center stage amidst positive indicators of declining current account deficit as a percentage of GDP, falling unemployment rates, and a notable rise in digital transactions. These statistics affirm the robustness of the economy, showcasing a trajectory of growth and stability.The achievements in taxation reforms are nothing short of remarkable, with direct tax collections more than trebling in the last decade, the number of tax return filers increasing by 2.4 times, average processing time of tax returns plummeting from 93 days in FY 2013-14 to an impressive 10 days in FY 2023-24, resulting in issuance of quick refunds. These are the results of consistent progressive measures thus obviating the need for, and rightly avoiding, any last-minute populist measures.No change in existing tax rates, both for direct and indirect taxes, is a good indicator of stability and predictability for investors and taxpayers.A welcome move to waive outstanding tax demands that are minor, disputed, and unreconciled. This involves the withdrawal of outstanding direct tax demands up to Rs. 25,000 pertaining to the period up to FY 2009-10 and up to Rs.10,000 for FY 2010-11 to 2014-15.The Government's commitment to fostering a business-friendly environment is evident in its intent to extend specific tax benefits for start-ups, investments by sovereign wealth funds/ pension funds, and certain IFSC units. The extension has been made now until March 31, 2025. This might help in creating a conducive landscape for business.To align with the CBDT notification issued earlier, the provisions relating to tax collection at source concerning remittances under the Liberalized Remittance Scheme have now been formally incorporated in the Finance Bill, 2024, setting the rate at 20% for amounts exceeding Rs. 7 lakhs in a financial year.The Finance Bill, 2024 proposes an extension of the time limit for introducing the faceless scheme by the Central Government for transfer pricing proceedings, DRP Proceedings, and ITAT Proceedings, up to March 31, 2025.The interim Budget 2024 may not have proposed significant tax announcements, but it very well positioned the prelude to the full budget post the upcoming elections. Considering the potential impact on the population across the four pillars of GYAN, a sizable portion of India stands to be covered. The interim Budget’s focus on the tax front resembles a report card, highlighting the maturity achieved by our tax system. The enhancement of taxpayer services was emphasized as a key priority.","This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data and N for Nari utthan.

The Finance Minister on February 01, 2024, delivered a truly innovative interim budget. At first glance, it did not seem like an interim budget but looked more like the budget to drive further growth and a continuum of inclusive growth-oriented investments.At the outset, this budget brings a wonderful balance between fiscal prudence and continued investment for growth.It's not easy to continue the glide path of reducing the fiscal deficit and continuing to make significant investments in all areas including infrastructure, R&D, energy transition, technology, skilling, and social welfare. The surprising reduction in fiscal deficit of 5.8% as against the budgeted 5.9% for FY24 and the projection of 5.1% in FY25 with a clear focus on increasing investments was a huge positive.This was a budget for everyone and all because it caters to every part of the Indian economy and society. The FM has carefully catered to the investment needs of various sectors. The continued focus on youth, impoverished, women and farmers to increase their involvement and contribution to economic growth is evident. By committing an 11.1% increase in capital expenditure to 11,11,111 lakh crore, the FM has clearly brought every single 1 in this growth journey.What was very impressive was the inclusion strategy of the government. The focus on women's empowerment for the past few years is unprecedented, which is reflected in the inclusion of women in the workforce moving from 23.3% to 37% in the last five years. The thirty crore Mudra Yojna loans to women entrepreneurs were a great boost to the Nari Shakti initiative. We already have over 10 million Lakhpati Didis and what is truly evident is like a corporate CFO, the FM has revised the earlier target of 20 million Lakhpati Didis to 30 million. The government also plans to invest in initiatives to encourage young girls between the ages of 9 and 14 to undertake the vaccination for cervical cancer which is again a great boost to Nari Shakti.A lot needs to be done to bring more women into all parts of economic growth but the journey so far and the vision of the future is truly inspiring.While India continues on its technological prowess and makes its mark in new technologies like Artificial Intelligence, we need a multi-pronged strategy to harness the power of AI. We need a clear focus on building AI systems in India so that we not only emerge as a global leader in this new era but can build models, which are specific to India that will benefit Indians. At the same time, we need a very wide coverage program to build skills to leverage AI to its fullest potential. The biggest contribution we can make to the inclusion of youth in the economic development of the country is by skilling them in new skill areas. In the last few years, the Skill India Mission has trained 14 million youth, reskilled over 5 million youth and established a staggering 3,000 new ITIs. The future of any country will depend as much on capital investments as on skill investments.The focus on agricultural development and support to the farmer continues through direct financial assistance to farmers. The farmers have benefited by getting crop insurance through PM Fasal Bima Yojana. It's not just the farmers, the PM-SVANidhi provides credit assistance to a large number of street vendors.The last few years have seen the journey of affordable housing through Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY). There is a slight increase in allocation to launch a scheme for encouraging the middle class to build or buy new homes. This investment will likely propel a wider economic development and increase employment.India has seen a tremendous rise in entrepreneurship in the last few years. In order to continue the journey and promote new startups, the government proposes to extend certain tax benefits, which are expiring from March 2024 to March 2025. The MSMEs have not been left behind. With a proposal to provide timely finances to such enterprises, the government has paved the way for their growth, so they can look to compete globally.All in all, it’s a truly inclusive budget with a clear focus on development not just by giving away freebies but enabling the people to participate in the economic development activity. While the FM calls the comprehensive GDP - Governance, Development & Performance – to me, this budget is inclusive of another GDP – gender, demography, and professions.","Akhilesh Tuteja is Partner and Head, Clients and Markets, KPMG in India.

‘Enough domestic sources of demand to counter drag from external sector’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/enough-domestic-sources-of-demand-to-counter-drag-from-external-sector/articleshow/107372012.cms,"Do you think the

creates room for lower interest rates?

One of the issues that the Budget has flagged is the demographic challenge and opportunity and the societal change that is taking place. How do you view this?

Niti Aayog is working on the Viksit Bharat roadmap. What will be the focus areas?

You are as much a representative of the Centre as well as the states. Is it time to revisit the entire formula for transfers to states particularly on the issue of cesses and surcharges?

Suman Bery , who heads Niti Aayog , the govt think tank, is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China, which he says is also an opportunity for India. The economist is confident that Indian states remain resilient. Excerpts of the interview with TOI.The finance ministry expects the economy to grow 7% next year. Given the global situation, how do you see the prospects?The belief in the finance ministry is that we have a possible drag coming from the external sector but that we have other sources. We have enough domestic sources of demand. One has to applaud the political and economic judgment of FM in deciding that it was appropriate to pursue the path of fiscal consolidation. There is transparency. What this actually reflects is responsible economic management, which is one reason we are where we are. Second, it also creates a buffer so that there is policy space if we do encounter headwinds.That’s the hope and expectation. We have an independent central bank and an inflation targeting central bank, so it is up to the monetary policy committee to take a call through the monetary policy committee on the repo rate .The PM has said that when India grows its states grow. India is a composite of 37 states and UTs. They are each at very different points in their demographic transition. There are some states where the net replacement rate is down to 1%, like Kerala . There are others, particularly UP and Bihar, which are in their earliest stage of demographic transition and each one of these states is the size of a large European country. There are two implications of that — one is internal labour mobility and it will become an even larger part of our growth model. The govt has taken several steps to create a unified market. Our main endowment is our human capital and that has to be equipped to participate in global exchange in many ways. We know from China, Japan that the demographic dividend partly depends on markets and on human capital. But the golden period is fairly short lived, about 15 years, when the so called dependency ratio declines. The other big opportunity the PM has been highlighting is bringing women much more into the active labour force.When Niti was set up there was the idea of a three-year vision and a seven-year strategy paper. The reality is that schemes of govt tend to be aligned with the award of the Finance Commission . There are various established building blocks or hand holds which are already a matter of govt policy. The PM is much more interested in a national debate on what it means to be a Viksit Bharat or modern society. We have a collective goal and it is for the democratic polity to define what that goal should be. Its emphatically not for a super mandarin bureaucracy. It is not going to be Lee Kwan Yew’s Singapore led from the top.It’s entirely a finance ministry matter but I would be lying if I didn’t say when I visit certain states there is this complaint. A big frontier would be resource mobilisation at the state level. Second is going to be rationalisation of subsidies not only at the Union level, but also at the state level. All chief ministers sit on my governing council. When they convene as the governing council, I see them in their role as development practitioners. The world is beginning to appreciate quite how much institutional and political maturity India attained in our 75 years and the most fundamental dimension of a democracy, we have orderly transfers of power. There are enough buffers to ensure that what happens in state finances is unlikely to create macro instability. Those risks are well contained by our Constitution. The chief ministers know that they are going to be judged by development outcomes and so you can have the sugar rush of changing of pension plans or various handouts but if the cupboard is bare you are not going to be able to deliver.","Suman Bery is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China.

Government's Marathon to 2047: Emphasis on Fiscal Prudence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/governments-marathon-to-2047-emphasis-on-fiscal-prudence/articleshow/107371788.cms,"What was the thinking behind keeping the vote on account absolutely straight?

So is it the idea to keep the Budget completely transparent?

The capex has risen 11.1% and there is an emphasis on infrastructure spending. But there is also the hope that the private sector will now take over and start capital spending. Given the geopolitical situation, how confident is the govt that it will pan out as planned?

Finance secretary T V Somanathan, in an interview with TOI, says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047 . Excerpts:If you see the Budget speech you will see the emphasis on 2047. The govt has set its sight on running that marathon. Running to 2047 is a marathon , it’s not a sprint. If you are going to run a marathon, you need to be in good shape and you can’t have short-term stimulants or something that will get you some yards and then it’s done.The whole focus is on making India a developed country by 2047, for which a healthy present and a strong fiscal position is an important concomitant. Some purely short term measures don’t really fit into that picture. It’s a consistent picture: focus on the long term for which you need to build strength in the short term and that needs to be done by prudence in fiscal policy and by not doing things which can detract you from that path. Not doing the wrong thing is more important than appearing to do things.The idea is that govt finances may be good, bad or indifferent depending on the times, depending on the circumstances, depending on the policies. But what is the position should be reflected as reasonably and accurately as possible. That is an emphasis. As regards the Finance Commission, again the terms of reference that have been given to them are the terms in the Constitution.What is the means by which the devolution should be done is a matter they have full discretion. They can actually take all kinds of factors into account and in a sense we felt this time based on my review of the previous commissions that the right expression would be less is more. The shorter, less prescriptive terms of reference gives full scope for all stakeholders including state govts to express their viewpoints and for the commission to take a balanced view of the different perspectives and then come to its award. Ultimately the award of the Finance Commission is about devolution and grant for which full scope has now been given to them.n There are incipient signs of private capital expenditure accelerating. There are some surveys I have seen done by some of the chambers industry, which show high levels of investment. The PMI, which is a sort of leading indicator, is also looking pretty healthy. Capacity utilisation is one reason that private sector capital expenditure doesn’t immediately pick up when the economy starts accelerating because there is surplus capacity.But increasingly I get the sense that many industries are beginning to reach levels where they have to add capacity. When that happens capital investment will happen. Another pointer also mentioned in the Budget speech you may notice that our airlines have placed large orders for planes — that is capital expenditure.When you import 1,000 aircraft, it’s just not 1,000 aircraft, there are concomitant additions to ground handling facilities, you need airports to expand, you need to employ people to do that. That means a lot of jobs. The aircraft is capital but then look at the effect it is going to have on skilled jobs. So capital expenditure is happening. I am fairly confident that we will have decent capital expenditure in the year to come and that will become a new source of acceleration.",Finance secretary T V Somanathan says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047.

Jayachandran Ramachandran: Claude 3.5 Sonnet sets new coding benchmarks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/times-techies/claude-3-5-sonnet-sets-new-coding-benchmarks/articleshow/111329656.cms,"Anthropic’s latest AI model , Claude 3.5 Sonnet , arrived seemingly out of nowhere last week, free to use for everyone, and is now setting new benchmarks in a number of metrics. Most notably, it aced the leader boards in key categories of the LMSYS Chatbot Arena , a benchmark used to measure large language model performance. Specifically, it secured the top position in the ‘Coding Arena’ and ‘Hard Prompts’ categories, beating industry behemoths like GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro , all while being a lighter, faster model to run.Jayachandran Ramachandran , senior VP of Artificial Intelligence Labs for C5i, says the LMSYS Chatbot Arena is a crowdsourced open benchmarking platform and that users perform various tasks in pair wise comparison of models and provide feedback on which models can satisfactorily provide the best response. “The ranking system is quite transparent, robust, and reliable. In recent times, the top position was occupied by frontier models such as GPT-4 series and Gemini-1.5 series. It is a significant development for Claude 3.5 Sonnet to outsmart other leading frontier models and occupy the top position, especially in coding tasks,” he says.Saurav Swaroop , co-founder & CTO of financing platform Velocity, which recently launched Vani AI , a GenAIled customer calling solution for financial institutions, says that while GPT-4 has been assisting developers with writing code for some time now, it has been prone to errors and hallucinations. “However, Claude can write production level deployable code now. This will boost developer productivity and the time to build software will keep coming down,” he says.With its advanced reasoning skills, it’s great at handling multi-step workflows too, which is essential for complex projects, says Sourabh Kumar, senior manager of experience engineering for Publicis Sapient. “Compared to other industry leaders like GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet offers faster processing speeds and higher accuracy in complex coding and reasoning tasks. For industries such as finance, where accurate data analysis is critical, or retail, where trend prediction can drive success, integrating Claude 3.5 Sonnet can lead to significant efficiency gains and innovation,” he says.Claude 3.5 Sonnet can also offer alternative solutions that coders might not have even considered, says Bebi Negi, senior lead data scientist at the Analytics Centre of Excellence for Happiest Minds Technologies.However, Bebi says coders will still need to check the code created by the model. “While it can create code quickly, it is very important to understand the code and make sure it meets a project’s requirements and standards. Even though benchmarks rate the model at around 90%, the remaining 10% gap underscores the necessity for coders to review the outputs,” she says.Securing the top spot in the Hard Prompts category was also a big deal, says Bebi. “The Hard Prompts category was all about handling complex tasks and instructions. The model did a great job here too, showing it can understand and generate high-quality content, even when the instructions are quite tricky.”","Anthropic’s latest AI model, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, is now free to use for everyone.

GenAI: On-device AI is cheaper and faster than cloud,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/times-techies/on-device-ai-is-cheaper-and-faster-than-cloud/articleshow/111329501.cms,"As devices such as smartphones , laptops, tablets and cars become more intelligent and powerful with increased processing capabilities and sensors, the tech industry is focusing on harnessing the power of AI on the edge or on-device AI to come up with more context-aware personalised user experiences.And while AI may have started off as something very specific to image processing, it has over the past four to five years evolved and exploded, especially with GenAI coming into play, to include a lot more use cases around text processing, voice processing and multimodal use cases, said Rajesh Narayanan, vice president of engineering at Qualcomm .He was speaking on ₹AI on the Edge’ at the first edition of the ‘TechForward’ research seminar series launched by Indian Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad (IIITH). The series seeks to spark regular and deep academia-industry conversations around emerging technologies.Narayanan pointed out that on-device AI has evolved to offer advantages such as personalisation , privacy and security, and with lower energy consumption and costs, and better performance compared to AI on the cloud.“Today, smartphones, smartwatches, devices that are a part of home automation, devices in the car and industrial IoT are equipped with plenty of cameras and sensors and are becoming a lot more powerful with the ability to collect more data. They also have more processing capacities, leading to more context aware user experience that can lead to a much better day-to-day life for all of us,” he said.He said that for all this to become a reality, you need a very powerful AI engine, and the overall solution has to be extremely power efficient.Personalisation is a key selling point for on-device AI as all the data that was earlier being sent to the cloud, potentially compromising privacy and security, can be done on the device. On-device AI also brings down energy consumption significantly compared to running workloads on a much bigger infrastructure like the cloud.Performance too improves as processing on the device itself can enable low latency as opposed to sending the query to the cloud, as with devices like Alexa.Narayanan said on-device AI is also a lot more affordable compared to the cloud. “As we transition from traditional AI to GenAI, the cost per query is actually going up and cloud economics isn’t going to work as compared to doing it on the device,” he said.In his talk on Vision on the AI edge’, Anoop Namboodiri , who heads the Biometrics and Secure Identity Lab and is associated with the Centre for Visual Information Technology at IIITH, said computer vision is playing a key role in pushing AI, and now GenAI.","The tech industry is focusing on harnessing the power of AI on the edge or on- device AI to come up with more context-aware personalised user experiences.

Service bots get our lingo,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/times-techies/service-bots-get-our-lingo/articleshow/111329125.cms,"Moving to complex functions

Indic language capability

is a little expensive now

The other day I decided to check out an airline’s chatbot to see how it works. I keyed in: “I’m travelling with my 8-year-old son, recommend the best flight without disturbing his sleep”. It asked for my source and destination, which I gave as Chennai and Hyderabad. It asked for the date. I typed ₹Mon’ (for Monday), but it did not recognise what I meant.I typed ₹tom’, it correctly recognised it as tomorrow.The bot responded that there were no flights that “fully meet” my specified criteria and provided a bunch of options. I then asked for the cheapest flight, and non-stop flights. The options it provided were correct – I confirmed that on MakeMyTrip and Google Flights. It automatically filled the passenger list as 1 adult and 1 child for booking. It even clarified the availability of gluten free food for my fictional son.Customer support bots have come a long way from the days of clunky bots that only answered FAQs. These sophisticated generative AI-based tools are much better than their predecessors, though still far from perfect. Sometimes they ask silly questions even after being explicitly told. They struggle to recognise colloquial words, have woefully poor memory, unlike human agents. But at least you don’t have to listen to hold music for 15 minutes.The leap comes from GenAI ’s ability to understand conversations better, their ability to understand multilingual queries , and support for interfaces like voice and videos. As these systems improve, customer support will become a lot quicker and easier for users, and hugely cheaper for companies, since they won’t have to hire thousands of contact centre staff.Ramprakash Ramamoorthy, director of AI Research at Zoho Corp, says with GenAI, the next goal is to make customer assistant bots do more complex and autonomous functions. He says they could hand over the issue to human agents when it figures it can’t handle it. He says they may even be able to process warranty claims, for instance. “As soon as you reach out, the system will be able to cross-check the database for similar issues/ queries where warranty claims are applicable. A human agent will have to call a supervisor to do the same job,” he says.But these are still some time away. Even for basic customer support services, companies are being careful due to concerns around data privacy, and hallucination. Nobody, after all, wants to get into a situation like Air Canada did earlier this year when its chatbot offered a discount to a customer that it wasn’t supposed to.Chaitanya Chokkareddy, cofounder of Ozonetel, the Hyderabadbased customer experience tech provider, says the focus currently is on automating the most common, repetitive queries. Chatbots, he says, fail in non-common areas of work.He says a lot of work is happening with AI in the back-end like data analysis, summary, intent analysis, and quality control, focusing on efficiency and productivity of human customer agents and improving margins of companies. “We handle about 20 million calls per day which last about 3 to 5 minutes each, and a lot of that data is currently not accessible to managers to make better decisions on their product and services. Demand for back-end services is higher than customer facing applications,” he says.While AI assistants perform relatively well in English, their performance in Indic languages is not great. Ozonetel is building Telugu language tokenisation by working with a non-profit and 1 lakh student interns to build a Telugu database. But Indian languages, he says, cost around 5x to 10x more compared to English because of the complex tokenisation of Indian languages compared to the Roman alphabet. “AI models are charged based on usage and chatbots using Indic scripts have more tokens and hence have higher computational costs. In many cases, the costs are equivalent to a human being and so our customers don’t want to automate,” Chaitanya says.Ankush Sabharwal’s CoRover.ai also has a local language model called BharatGPT. The bot can respond to voice queries in Indian languages, and provide tailored information. It also has video chatbots with pre-generated videos and text-to-video conversion and lip sync, which can be used for purposes like internal training.Ankush says redundant workload should be automated first, and as the adoption increases, more clear use cases will emerge. He says problems like hallucination can be reduced with retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and use of domain-specific small models.Abhiroop Medhekar, founder & CEO of financing platform Velocity, says they have built text-to-speech and speech-to-text tech for AI-agent voice call automation. They initially used it internally and then started commercial offerings. “Some BFSI applications require an immediate response from customers, but customers frequently don’t respond to mails or WhatsApp reminders. The current robotic IVR calls are not effective either. But these GenAI-based voice calls are interactive and provide better results,” he says.","Chatbots have come a long way from the days of clunky bots that only answered FAQs.

Charges in absentia

The United States announced a reward of up to $5 million for information leading to the capture of OneCoin founder Ruja Ignatova popularly known as "" cryptoqueen ."" She is wanted by both the United States and Germany ""for her participation in one of the largest global fraud schemes in history,"" which resulted in losses exceeding $4 billion for victims, according to US ambassador to Bulgaria Kenneth Merten.Ambassador Merten stated that the United States will release a statement later on Wednesday detailing how individuals can ""anonymously provide tips to assist us in this ongoing investigation.""Ruja Ignatova, aged 44 is a German citizen of Bulgarian origin, who launched a ripoff of bitcoin named 'BigCoin' with her friend Sebastian Karl Greenwood . Later, both of them launched another fake cyptocurrency named 'OneCoin' in Sofia in 2014 and raised billion of dollars. It was later revealed that she duped investors worldwide of an estimated $4 billion between 2014 and in 2017.She evaded arrest by fleeing on a flight from Sofia to Athens just two weeks after her indictment in October 2017, and her current location remains unknown. It is believed that she bugged her American boyfriend flat whom she suspected of cooperating with the FBI.She was later added to the list of the 10 most wanted fugitives by the Federal Bureau of Investigation on charges of forgery and money laundering in 2022. Some reports also suggests that that she underwent a plastic surgery and frequently changes her appearance.However, her partner Greenwood was arrested in 2018 in Thailand and later extradited to the US. He was sentenced to 20 years in prison and was also ordered to pay back $300 million back to the investors.Ignatova's brother Konstantin Ignatov was arrested at Los Angeles International Airport in March 2019. He pleaded guilty to wire fraud in a deal with US authorities and was sentenced to 34 months in jail. He was released in March 2024.Meanwhile, a recent BBC investigation claims that that a top mafia figure in Bulgaria, Hristoforos Nikos Amanatidis, better known as Taki, who has a El Chapo-like image in his native Bulgaria might have murdered her.Ignatova and her associates tapped the global network to market the fake crypto to friends and family in exchange for their own payouts. Millions of investos infused funds in large amounts before they realised that OneCoin wasn’t a cryptocurrency and was not backed by any secured, independent blockchain-type technology like other crypto currencies.Meanwhile, the FBI said that when OneCoin users logged in to check their wallets, they’d simply see random numbers on a screen. The US government has termed OneCoin as one of the “biggest fraud schemes” in the global history.It was a classic Ponzi scheme , in which early investors are encouraged to find others and then paid out by receipts from later investorsMoreover OneCoin's prices were always rigged as it didn’t have any independent foundation, no technological basis. While Bitcoin had ups and downs, OneCoin rose steadily in ‘value’ from €0.5 in January 2015 to €29.95 in January 2019.Additionally, the fake crypto never traded on public exchange. Ignatova had created a private exchange named Xcoinx.com for trading, however, it was designed to prevent quick exits. If you owned 1,000 OneCoins, you were allowed to sell a maximum of 15 (1.5%) in a day. Besides, there was no guarantee that your sell order would be executed. Additionally, starting January 2017, Xcoinx was always ‘under maintenance’, so selling became impossible.Bulgaria has announced to prosecute Igantovs in absentia, as announced by chief prosecutor Borislav Sarafov on Wednesday, enabling proceedings to confiscate her property worth over 10 million euros.","Ruja Ignatova, 44, is a German citizen of Bulgarian origin.

Nokia taps AI boom with $2.3 billion Infinera purchase,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/nokia-taps-ai-boom-with-2-3-billion-infinera-purchase/articleshow/111339274.cms,"STOCKHOLM: Nokia 's bid to buy US optical networking gear maker Infinera in a $2.3 billion deal puts the Finnish company on track to gain from the billions of dollars in investment pouring into data centres to cater to the rise of artificial intelligence.The deal would help Nokia to leapfrog Ciena and become the second largest vendor in the optical networking market with a 20% share, behind Huawei , which is benefiting from the minimal presence of Western companies in China.Telecom gear makers , struggling with lower sales of 5G equipment, have been looking for ways to diversify their markets and get into growing areas such as AI .Nokia's move will allow the company to sell more equipment to big tech companies such as Amazon , Alphabet and Microsoft as they invest billions of dollars in building new data centres to service the artificial intelligence boom.""This is pretty optimal timing for a deal of this nature when you are timing it just before the market is expected to start to recover,"" Nokia CEO Pekka Lundmark said in an interview with Reuters.""AI is driving significant investments in data centres ... one of the key attractions of this acquisition is that it significantly increases our exposure to data centres,"" he said.Data centres use optical transport networks - cables made of glass that transmit digital signals - to allow electronic devices to talk to each other.Infinera is especially strong in intra data centre communications, which refers to server-to-server communications inside data centers. This will be one of the fastest growing segments in the overall communications technology market, Lundmark said.Nokia shares rose 4% in morning trade, signaling that the shareholders are bullish about the deal. The share price of buyers would typically ease due to dilution in a cash-and-stock deal.Nokia, which will pay 70% of the purchase price in cash and the rest in stock, expects to save 200 million euros ($213.88 million) in costs following the deal's closure next year.While the purchase multiple may be somewhat steep as Infinera had a lumpy growth trajectory, if Nokia could extract the 200 million euros in synergies, then the purchase price would be justified, said Mads Rosendal, analyst at Danske Bank Credit Research.Infinera gets about 60% of its business from the United States, while Nokia had a bigger share in Europe and Asia, making it a complementary transaction, said Lundmark.""The two businesses together have combined cost of sales of over 2 billion euros and operating expenses of over a billion euros ... so against that target, 200 million (euros) is not a particular stretch,"" Lundmark said, adding that it was too early to comment on potential layoffs.",Nokia to buy US optical networking gear maker Infinera in a $2.3 billion deal.

Facebook: Meta says it may block news from Facebook in Australia,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/meta-says-it-may-block-news-from-facebook-in-australia/articleshow/111334769.cms,"SYDNEY: Facebook owner Meta is considering blocking news content from the platform in Australia if the government makes it pay licensing fees, a company representative told a parliamentary hearing on Friday.Meta's regional policy director Mia Garlick told lawmakers ""all options are on the table"" when asked if the company would block Australians from sharing news content to avoid paying fees.""There's a large number of channels that people can get news content from,"" Garlick told the inquiry.She said Meta was waiting for Canberra to decide if it would apply an untested 2021 law which gives the government the right to set the fees US tech giants pay media outlets for links.The comments are the strongest indication so far that Meta would take the same hardline approach in Australia it took in Canada in 2023 when that country introduced similar laws.Meta struck deals with Australian media firms including News Corp and the Australian Broadcasting Corp when the law was brought in Australia, but has since said it will not renew those arrangements beyond 2024.It now falls on Australia's assistant treasurer to decide whether to step in and force Facebook to pay for news content. The assistant treasurer has said he is still collecting advice, but that Meta seems to respect the law only when it suits.Australia's two largest free-to-air television broadcasters, Nine Entertainment and Seven West Media, meanwhile said this week they were cutting jobs, citing loss of revenue once their deals with Meta expire.Asked on Friday if blocking news from Facebook in Australia would amount to sidestepping the law, Meta's Garlick said taking that action would be complying with it.""Every other law - tax laws, safety laws, privacy laws - we work to comply with,"" she said. ""It's just compliance would look slightly different in relation to this law if it's fully enacted.""Garlick defended Meta's processes for Australians to complain if they believed the company was spreading harmful misinformation or scams, although she said its content moderation centres were all in other countries.Asked about Australian mining billionaire Andrew Forrest , who is suing Meta for showing cryptocurrency scam advertisements featuring his face, Garlick said the company had processes in place to detect and stop scams, but ""there are a lot of challenges"".How could Meta call itself an advertising business when ""some ads sell lies"", asked Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young .""We have policies and systems and tools to do everything we can to prevent those ads,"" Garlick replied.","Facebook owner Meta is considering blocking news content from the platform in Australia if the government makes it pay licensing fees.

The Fed's intention was to cool off a red-hot labor market and slow wage growth , which can fuel inflation.Many economists had expected the rapid rate hikes would trigger a recession, but that's been avoided so far thanks to strong consumer demand and sturdier-than-expected labor market.But recent government data suggest that some cracks are beginning to show.Applications for jobless benefits are trending higher in June after mostly staying below 220,000 this year. The unemployment rate ticked up to 4% in May, despite the fact that America's employers added a strong 272,000 jobs last month.

‘Volatile and unpredictable’: Why fast-money traders like Donald Trump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/volatile-and-unpredictable-why-fast-money-traders-like-donald-trump/articleshow/111319089.cms,"Donald Trump ’s from-the-hip style may start making financial markets volatile again — and that’s just fine for a breed of global fast-money traders who thrive on that.With he and President Joe Biden running neck-and-neck ahead of their first debate Thursday night, investors have already been trying to game out how the Republican’s return to the White House could affect everything from the electric-vehicle industry to the direction of long-term interest rates.Markets, as a rule, don’t like that kind of uncertainty. But for a subset of hedge funds that swoop in and out whenever big swings and anomalies make prices look briefly out of whack, that’s almost beside the point.What they see in Trump is far more simple: Memories of the opportunities that arose during his four years in office, when his comments and social-media posts sometimes surprised investors, triggering dramatic short-term moves in the prices of stocks, bonds and currencies.“Politics aside, if you ask a trader whether he wants placid Biden or stormy Trump, the trader is going big wave surfing - so it’s Trump,” said Calvin Yeoh, portfolio manager at hedge fund Blue Edge Advisors in Singapore. “Trump is more volatile and unpredictable.”During the Biden years, of course, there’s been no shortage of volatility. The inflation surge, Russia’s war in Ukraine, and the Federal Reserve’s rate hikes all did plenty to whipsaw markets. As a result, some broad measures of expectedmarket swings have been higher than they were during much of Trump’s tenure, and it’s possible that conflicts with Republicans over issues like the debt ceiling could escalate if Biden wins a second term.Yet Biden has hewed to a traditional style honed by a decades-long career in Washington. By contrast, Trump relished communicating directly with the public through Twitter posts, leaving traders scrambling to determine the implications.With the election still more than four months away, it has so far been overshadowed in markets by the strength of the economy and speculation about when the Fed will start dialing back interest rates. Even so, there’s been some early preparation for heightened volatility around the November election, particularly if the outcome is in doubt.“The consensus view is that Trump will create volatility,” said Vineer Bhansali, founder of the Newport Beach, California-based asset-management firm LongTail Alpha. “The market is already priced for that to happen. So the surprise will be if Trump wins and actually there is less volatility.”Options That Hedge US Presidential Election Risk in Vogue | Premium of six-month options versus three-monthTrump’s initial victory in 2016 dealt a jolt to the bond market. Ten-year Treasury yields jumped nearly a full percentage point by December on anticipation that his tax-cut plans would spur the economy and prod the Fed to speed up its rate hikes.While in office, his comments and social-media posts sometimes sent ripples through the markets. In 2017, for example, Puerto Rico bonds tumbled when he suggested that the island’s debt would need to be erased completely after it was devastated by a hurricane — only to rebound once traders realized the issue would remain in the hands of the court already overseeing its bankruptcy.Amazon.com Inc.’s stock was dragged down the following year when Trump railed against the retailer’s shipping arrangements with the US Postal Service following a report he was “obsessed” with going after the company. In August 2019, US stocks were whipsawed repeatedly by his threats to sharply escalate a trade war with China, helping set off up-or-down moves of more than 1% in the S&P 500 during half of that month’s trading sessions. The spat also moved currency markets — one corner where hedge funds are active.Even some investors with a longer-term, fundamentals-driven approach expect a political shakeup under Trump to create ways to profit.“Trump noise sometimes creates opportunities,” Carol Lye, portfolio manager at Brandywine Global Investment Management in Singapore. She cited the slide in the Mexican peso in late 2016 as he pledged to build a border wall, before the currency rebounded the following year.The US election campaign will likely draw more attention from Wall Street as Election Day gets closer and policy positions become a more prominent part of the contest.Trump and Republicans have already made clear that they will push to renew sweeping tax cuts put in place in 2017 that are set to expire next year, though Biden and the Democrats have also indicated they want to extent at least some of them.Trump is also expected to seek to more aggressively deport those working in the US illegally and has called for 60% tariffs on imports from China and 10% duties on those from the rest of the world. Both of those could put upward pressure on inflation, potentially resetting the market’s expectations for interest-rate cuts.Some informal Trump advisers have floated ideas about possible changes to the Fed that would give him more power over the central bank, as well. While neither he nor the campaign has endorsed doing so, such a step would almost certainly roil the bond market by fanning worries that the bank would face politically motivated pressure to cut interest rates.“You have to address the elephant in the room, that no matter what happens in the scenario that Trump wins — everything that he says will be amplified in North America and globally,” said George Boubouras, head of research at hedge fund K2 Asset Management Ltd. “We in markets love volatility — but we do try not to get too hung up on the amplified emotion that will come from a Trump presidency.”",Hedge funds that swoop in and out whenever big swings and anomalies make prices look briefly out of whack.

"Global Minimum Tax: Global agreement on taxing ultra-rich is technically feasible, states G20-commissioned report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/a-global-agreement-on-taxing-the-ultra-rich-is-technically-feasible-states-g20-commissioned-report/articleshow/111312750.cms,"MUMBAI: In a landmark report unveiled recently Professor Gabriel Zucman has called for the adoption of a coordinated global minimum tax standard targeting the ultra-rich . This initiative aims to impose a 2% annual tax on the wealth of the world's 3,000 billionaires , potentially generating an additional $250 billion in global tax revenues. Extending this tax to individuals with a net worth of over $100 million could add between $100 billion and $140 billion annually.The report, titled ‘A Blueprint for a Coordinated Minimum Effective Taxation Standard for Ultra-High-Net-Worth Individuals’, was commissioned by the Brazilian presidency of the G20 in preparation for the G20 Finance Ministers meeting in Rio de Janeiro which is currently ongoing.""The structural failure of contemporary tax systems has resulted in the wealthiest 0.0001% paying proportionally less in taxes than other socio-economic groups,"" Zucman stated. ""Progressive taxation is essential for democratic societies, promoting social cohesion and public trust in government efforts for the common good. Ensuring that the ultra-rich pay their fair share is not just fair—it’s essential for protecting our democracies and funding critical public services.""The report's proposal builds on recent advances in international tax cooperation, such as the adoption of a 15% minimum tax on multinational corporations by over 130 jurisdictions in 2021 and the significant reduction in offshore tax evasion due to increased information exchange between countries. These developments, Zucman argues, have paved the way for successfully implementing a global minimum tax on the ultra-wealthy.The G20 proposal follows from detailed work conducted by the UN tax committee, whose Subcommittee on Wealth and Solidarity Taxes is now preparing a model wealth tax law to support the introduction of national wealth taxes. In addition, the ongoing negotiations at the Ad-Hoc Committee to Draft Terms of Reference for a UN Framework Convention on International Tax Cooperation, composed of all UN member countries, has identified taxation of high net-worth individuals as a core element and is likely to include this in the terms of reference for the full negotiations to come.Brazilian finance minister Fernando Haddad praised the proposal, emphasizing the importance of ensuring that everyone pays their fair share of taxes. ""The Brazilian G20 Presidency has prioritized international tax cooperation, advocating for a system where a few thousand individuals can finance actions that positively impact billions,"" Haddad said. ""This proposal is fair from social, economic, and political standpoints, and it benefits from world-class analytical research.""The report highlights the disproportionate economic and political power held by billionaires, who, despite being a minuscule fraction of the population, significantly influence large corporations, media, and policymaking. Since the 1980s, tax distortions have allowed the ultra-rich to avoid substantial income taxes by structuring their wealth in ways that minimize taxable income.Zucman suggests that the proposed 2% global minimum tax could be implemented without requiring a multilateral treaty. Participating countries could use various domestic instruments to enforce the standard, ensuring that even billionaires relocating to non-participating countries would still be subject to the tax.Public opinion strongly supports curbing tax injustices, with a global survey conducted by IPSOS indicating that 67% of adults in G20 countries believe economic inequality is excessive and 70% think the rich should pay higher taxes. In the UK, South Africa, and Kenya, this percentage rises to 78%, states the report.""The goal of this report is to start a global political conversation, not to end it,"" Zucman concluded. ""After the progress of the last fifteen years in tax transparency and multinational taxation, the time is ripe for this new form of international cooperation.""","Professor Gabriel Zucman has called for the adoption of a coordinated global minimum tax standard targeting the ultra-rich. This initiative aims to impose a 2% annual tax on the wealth of the world's 3,000 billionaires.
