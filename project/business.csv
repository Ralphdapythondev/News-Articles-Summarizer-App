TDS Deposition - TDS deducted as above should be deposited to the government treasury within 7 days from the end of the month in which such tax is deducted. In case the taxes are deducted in the month of March then TDS is required to be deposited on or before 30th April.

Practically, the concerned Registrar while registering the sale deed of the property may sometimes verify the TDS deducted on the sale of property, hence one needs to have the TDS deposited before proceeding with execution of the sale deed.

Filing of TDS Return – Buyer is required to file quarterly withholding tax Return (in Form 27Q) within the prescribed timelines [i.e., On or before 31st of the month immediately succeeding the quarter in which TDS is deducted. In the case of the last quarter (Jan-March), the due date is 31st May].

With the robust growth in the Indian real estate market there is enhanced interest to own a residential property and benefit from increasing property prices or to simply earn passive incomes.If you are among those individuals who are involved in a property transaction (either as a buyer or a non-resident seller) where the seller of the property is a NR, then it would be imperative for you to be aware of the compliance provisions relating to Tax deduction at source (‘TDS’).First and foremost, it will be pertinent for the buyer of the property to ascertain whether the seller is a NR or not as per the specific provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (‘the IT Act’). This can be done by requesting stay details of the seller in India for the relevant financial year (‘FY’).This article focuses on TDS compliances which need to be complied with by a buyer while buying a property in India from a NR taxpayer.As per the provisions of the IT Act, person responsible for making payment to a NR, any sum chargeable to tax, is required to deduct appropriate TDS at the time of such payment. Accordingly, buyer of the property is required to comply with the following:The buyer of the property is required to deduct TDS at the time of making payment to the NR seller at the following prescribed rates:Technically speaking the buyer of the property is required to deduct TDS on the income element (i.e. computed capital gains) and hence is required to review the quantum of the taxable capital gain income. Considering the practical difficulties associated for the buyer to verify all of this (as the seller may claim capital gains exemption basis proposed re-investment in another property, actual computation may result in loss due to cost of acquisition/ improvements, Tax treaty benefits etc.), as a prevalent market practice TDS is deducted at the aforesaid rates on the total sale consideration.The same may significantly impact the cash flow of the NR seller as a portion of the sale consideration gets blocked in the form of TDS, which can only be claimed as offset against the advance tax/ self-assessment tax liability (if any) against the other income of the NR seller or as a refund (if applicable) in the India tax return for such year.To provide clarity for the buyer and ease the TDS burden for the seller, there are prescribed provisions under the Act wherein the income-tax officer can issue a lower / nil TDS certificate basis the specific facts of the case.As per the provisions of the IT Act, either the buyer or seller of the property, may file an application for obtaining a certificate for lower or nil deduction of tax along with prescribed documents and information. Upon receipt of such certificate, the buyer is required to deduct TDS at the rates prescribed in the certificate only. Process of obtaining certificate needs some time, hence you should appropriately factor the same in the agreed payment terms / completion of transaction.In a summary, either if as an NR you are selling a property in India or as a buyer you are purchasing a property from an NR, you need to be mindful of TDS compliances and related issues, to ensure a smooth transaction and correct compliances.Also, if the NR seller intends to remit money outside India, he/ she would need to evaluate the provisions of Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 (‘FEMA’) in terms of permissibility as well as take note of other prescribed compliances such as filing of Form 15CA, 15CB, etc., as may be applicable at the time of making the remittance.","This article focuses on TDS compliances which need to be complied with by a buyer while buying a property in India from a NR taxpayer.

Mumbai: Former Citigroup CEO Vikram Pandit is set to exit the real estate financing business established by veteran dealmaker Nimesh Kampani .INH Mauritius , an investment fund managed by Pandit, will sell 49% in JM Financial Credit Solutions (JMFCS) — the realty financing business — to Kampani’s JM Financial in a deal valued at about Rs 3,000 crore.Pandit will subsequently step down from the chairman’s position of the mid-tier NBFC.The move will increase JM Financial’s stake in JMFCS to 96% from 47%. The balance 4% is held by Moraine Master Fund and Aparna Aiyar, the wife of Pandit’s business partner Hariharan Aiyar. Hariharan too will step down from the board of JMFCS following the change in shareholding. JM Financial, which has been restricted from managing debt issues as well as offering loans against shares by regulators due to governance lapses, will buy 43% from INH Mauritius for Rs 1,282 crore in the first phase of the transaction. It will finance the deal through internal accruals which stands at over Rs 4,000 crore.INH is exiting JMFCS as the fund’s life is getting over, sources said. It first bought into JMFCS in fiscal 2015 and later acquired more shares in 2017 and then again in 2018, investing a total of Rs 950 crore in the NBFC. JMFCS marked Pandit’s first investment in India’s financial services sector. Pandit also holds 1.2% in the listed JM Financial. The deal valuation of Rs 3,000 crore is lower than JMFCS’ net worth of Rs 4,200 crore. This is because there has been under-recoveries in real estate financing and the same hasn’t been provided in the books. The under-recoveries are a result of stress on developers, said sources.Separately, JMFCS will buy 72% in an asset reconstruction company from JM Financial for Rs 856 crore. The move will increase JMFCS’ stake in JMFARC to 82% from 10%.The balance 18% is held by Ambuja Cements founder Narotam Sekhsaria (9%), Valiant Mauritius Partners and Indian Overseas Bank. The step is being taken as JM Financial Asset Reconstruction (JMFARC) needs funding on a regular basis as it has been under stress because of certain investments. Moreover, JMFCS, with a cash reserve of Rs 1,300 crore, is in a much better position to support JMFARC.","Ex-Citi chief Vikram Pandit to exit Kampani's fin biz in Rs 3k crore deal.

Budget 2024 expectations : As India strives to attain developed nation status, the healthcare sector stands as a crucial component, underpinning the nation's aims for inclusive growth, sustainable development, and a bright future for its citizens. Over the past decade, India has made notable progress in healthcare, with significant advancements in infrastructure, technology, and accessibility.While the government has undertaken numerous vital reforms for the healthcare sector, the industry stakeholders have high expectations from the new government on the healthcare needs of the nation, especially regarding public health spending , which is anticipated to increase to 2.5% of GDP by 2025, aligning with the National Health Policy 2017 . To enhance healthcare infrastructure, there's a need to realign financing schemes to meet sector needs, ensuring a minimum lending period of 10 years. This should cover medical colleges and their academic and hospital wings, including nursing and allied healthcare.Standardization in clinical practice through robust implementation of Standard Treatment Guidelines across all states is essential. For tackling NCDs like Cancer, a nodal agency should be set up for cancer care that will consolidate and simplify various programs and regulations currently under various departments and include innovative screening technologies (AI/non-AI) for early detection of diseases in the national program guidelines.We need to strengthen Ayushman Bharat - Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB-PMJAY) and expand the limit to 10 lakhs for all covered population and 15 lakh for specific diseases like organ transplant, oncology treatment etc. Additionally, a scientific costing study for various treatments under AB-PMJAY is necessary to determine sustainable reimbursement rates, encouraging private healthcare providers to participate and help expand the scheme to senior citizens (70 years & above), as announced by the government, and the underserved. Viable package rates are crucial so that existing secondary and tertiary care private hospitals join the scheme and newer hospitals can be built to meet the increased number of patients who would avail the scheme.Augmenting and strengthening the healthcare workforce is also critical for the Indian healthcare sector. An 'Empowered Group on National Healthcare Workforce' should be established, providing a multi-stakeholder platform to develop a comprehensive strategy for workforce development. A national-level registry for all types of healthcare workers that will serve as a tool to help Central and state governments’ plan for upskilling and interventions for equitable distribution of the workforce can be created. We also need to construct an epidemiologic ‘needs-based’ model for healthcare workforce planning that considers the health needs of the population, disease burden, population growth, healthcare delivery infrastructure, and other critical parameters. Such a model could use demographic population projections to estimate the number of nurses and physicians required to provide this core set of services in 2047.For ease of doing business, we need to reduce the compliance burden by establishing a Single Window Clearance System for the health services sector for investors and companies. Currently 55+ licenses are required, with multiple portals in different states asking for similar data requirements along with multiple application and payment processes. There are 179 Laws, Regulations, Rules and Guidelines applicable to healthcare organisations. Implementation of the Clinical Establishment Act should be uniform for all states.Further, it is important to allow hospitals and healthcare facilities to avail input tax credit (ITC), under the GST regime, so that the credit chain is enabled for the health services sector. Currently the healthcare facilities are unable to avail ITC leading to higher cost of services to patients.","The healthcare sector stands as a crucial component, underpinning the nation's aims for inclusive growth, sustainable development, and a bright future for its citizens.

Additionally, the setting-off of losses against profits and carrying over the loss for up to the next eight years makes the opportunity cost of such alternative investments quite lucrative,"" the report said. It added that govt should tweak the tax on deposit interest and implement a flat tax treatment across the maturity ladder.The report comes at a time when the IDBI Bank sale process is stuck because of RBI not granting 'fit and proper' recognition to any bidder.

Budget 2024 expectations : With an aim to enhance healthcare accessibility, the Modi government is actively pursuing plans to double the reach of its flagship Ayushman Bharat health insurance scheme over the next three years.According to a PTI report, discussions are intensifying to increase the annual insurance coverage under the Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB-PMJAY) from the current Rs 5 lakh to Rs 10 lakh per family - a step that may be announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman in the Union Budget 2024 .The expansion of AB-PMJAY would likely begin by covering all individuals aged 70 years and above, potentially extending comprehensive health coverage to more than two-thirds of India's population. This expansion is expected to add approximately 4 to 5 crore new beneficiaries to the program, significantly enhancing healthcare access for senior citizens across the country.This enhancement is crucial to alleviate financial burdens associated with costly medical treatments like organ transplants and cancer therapies, addressing a critical factor contributing to family indebtedness due to healthcare expenses.Also Read | Budget 2024 income tax expectations: Top 10 things FM Sitharaman should do for salaried taxpayers According to estimates by the National Health Authority, implementing these proposals would necessitate an additional annual expenditure of Rs 12,076 crore for the exchequer.

MUMBAI: The long-term capital gains tax provisions are not fair to certain taxpayers, and this requires an amendment in the upcoming Budget 2024 . Income-tax (I-T) is a progressive tax mechanism, the more you earn the more you pay. Understandably, the very rich, having a taxable income of over Rs 5 crore pay tax at the rate of 42.74 per cent , whereas those having a taxable income of Rs 5 lakh or less fall in the ‘nil’ tax bracket.The latter stand to benefit because of a rebate mechanism, that was introduced by the interim budget of 2019.A rebate is a deduction from the I-T payable and section 87A of the I-T Act allows for a full rebate from tax for an individual having income up to Rs. 5 lakh subject to an upper cap of Rs. 12,500. Thus, while the basic exemption limit is Rs. 2.5 lakh under the old regime and Rs. 3 Lakhs in the new regime owing to the rebate an individual with an income of up to Rs. 5 lakh and up to Rs. 7 lakh under the old and new regime respectively, do not have to pay tax.In fact, if the taxpayer under old regime takes the full benefit of Rs. 1.50 lakh available as a deduction for various investments made during the year (such as public provident fund, repayment of housing loan, LIC Premium, tax saving mutual funds), a gross income of up to Rs. 6.50 lakh may not attract any I-T at all. In addition, if such taxpayer is salaried, the standard deduction of Rs. 50,000 would ensure that a gross income of up to Rs. 7 lakh may not attract any tax. (Refer Case 1).However, the same taxpayer can be in for a rude shock if he has earned long-term capital gains, for which a ‘concessional’ rate of tax at 20 per cent is prescribed under section 112. For instance, long-term capital gains arising on sale/transfer of debt mutual funds, unlisted equity shares, immovable property are taxed under this section at 20 percent, with indexation benefit.Also Read | Budget 2024: Top 3 steps Modi government should consider for employment generation “While the concessional tax rate under section 112 can be an advantage for an individual in the higher tax brackets, it works to a great disadvantage for an individual who is having his/her taxable income, including long term capital gains, at less than Rs. 5 lakh. Under the new regime this disadvantage will continue for a person having income less than Rs. 12 Lakhs,” explains Ketan Vajani, chartered accountant.Vajani goes on to illustrate: An individual, offering his income under old regime, has sold his residential house and has earned a long-term capital gain of Rs. 4 lakh. His other income, during this particular financial year is just Rs. 75,000, which takes his total income to Rs. 4.75 lakh. As per the rational of section 87A, his tax liability should be nil.Unfortunately, he will end up paying a tax of Rs. 32,500. Here is how (Refer Case 2).“Even after getting rebate a rebate of Rs. 12,500, this individual will end up paying Rs. 32,500 as basic tax, plus a cess of Rs. 1,300 bringing his total tax liability to Rs. 33,800. In short – he is paying tax even if his total income is less than Rs. 5 lakh,” explains Vajani.Also Read | Budget 2024: 7 structural reforms FM Nirmala Sitharaman should target for sustainable growth Under the new regime, the tax rate of 20 per cent is provided beyond the income level of Rs. 12 Lakhs and accordingly the disadvantage will continue to the taxpayers having income up to 12 Lakhs, beyond which the calculations will be tax neutral.The Chamber of Tax Consultants had in the past represented that considering the inequity that is created, section 112 should be amended. Tax on long term capital gains should be charged at 5 per cent (instead of 20 per cent), in cases where the total income, including such long-term capital gain is more than the basic exemption limit of Rs. 2.5 lakh but less than Rs. 5 lakh or 7 lakh (for the new regime). Now with the optional tax regimes in place, the need for such an amendment is even more acute.","The long-term capital gains tax provisions are not fair to certain taxpayers, and this requires an amendment in the upcoming Budget 2024.

Interest for a three-month period:

Need for increase in threshold limit :

MUMBAI: The Income-tax (I-T) Act prescribes for payment of advance taxes if a taxpayer’s liability is more than Rs. 10,000. Section 234C provisions which entail payment of interest for an entire three-month period, till the next instalment date is unfair, especially for certain sections of individuals – like gig workers . Will Budget 2024 usher in a suitable amendment?Salaried individuals can disclose their total income (including the non-salary portion, such as bank interest, rent etc) to their employer, who then accordingly deducts tax at source, each month.If not, they must ensure advance taxes are duly paid as the tax deducted at source by the employer would not cover the entire tax liability . Non-salaried, have to meticulously compute and pay their own advance taxes.This is how it is done: Estimate the total income during the financial year. Reduce all eligible exemptions and deductions, based on the tax regime you have opted for. Further, reduce the tax deducted at source, or collected at source. Compute your estimated tax. If the amount of tax is more than Rs. 10,000 advance tax obligations apply.Small taxpayers who have opted for presumptive taxation scheme u/s 44AD (businessmen) and 44ADA (professionals such as doctors, lawyers) can pay their entire advance tax in one instalment by March 15. Further, senior citizens are not required to pay advance tax, if they do not earn any income from business or profession.Also Read | Budget 2024 income tax expectations: Top 10 things FM Sitharaman should do for salaried taxpayers The first instalment falls due within 75 days from the commencement of the new financial year. Those who do not have a steady salaried income (such as gig workers who have not opted for or are not eligible for presumptive taxation) find it challenging to gauge their income for the entire year at the very onset.Several individuals who moonlight – hold a job, but take up a small assignment here and there – for experience as well as additional income, tend to not opt for the presumptive tax scheme where 50% of the gross revenue has to be offered to tax.Capital gains that may arise on future sale of assets also cannot be predicted – this should be covered in the immutably following advance tax instalment.Sandeep Jhunjhunwala, partner, Nangia Andersen LLP says, “The exponential growth of income opportunities, especially for freelancers in the gig economy and new entrepreneurs, makes it exceedingly challenging to accurately predict annual income during the initial months of the financial year.”Also Read | Budget 2024 income tax expectations: Why 50% HRA exemption should include cities like Bengaluru, Hyderabad For their default, taxpayers have to bear interest under section 234C of one per cent per month, until the next instalment which falls due after three months. Even if there is an oversight and a default of one day, the interest payment is for the entire three months.To illustrate: Mr. A ought to have paid advance tax of Rs. 15,000 by June 15. However, he paid only Rs. 5,000. The shortfall is Rs. 10,000. Interest under section 234C will be Rs. 300 (which is @1% for three months).Jhunjhunwala states: “The challenge is further compounded by the stringent interest penalty structure. Even a one-day delay in any of the first three quarterly instalments results in a substantial 3% interest charge for the delayed quarter. Ideally, a more nuanced approach should be implemented. For example, if the June 15 instalment is paid by July 14, a lower interest rate of perhaps 1% could be applied instead of the punitive 3%. This would provide taxpayers with a small buffer period and alleviate the burden of unforeseen delays.”Earlier, the Bombay Chartered Accountants’ Society (BCAS) had in their pre-budget memorandum pointed out that the threshold limit of Rs. 10,000 was last amended by the Finance Act, 2009. Considering inflation, there is a need to increase this limit to a more realistic figure. Further, the requirement to pay advance tax in four instalments (which was only for corporate entities) was introduced for non-corporate taxpayers, by the 2016 budget. The law must be suitably amended to ensure that this requirement is removed for individuals.Prior to this amendment, the three due dates for payment of advance taxes were: September 15 (30% of the tax liability); December 15 (60% of the tax liability) and March 15 (100% of tax liability).Also Read | Budget 2024: 7 structural reforms FM Nirmala Sitharaman should target for sustainable growth “To streamline tax compliance and truly incentivise participation in this evolving economic ecosystem, broader relaxations from advance tax provisions for specific taxpayer categories are warranted. This could include freelancers, whose income is closely tied to project availability and market fluctuations, making income estimation highly improbable.Additionally, early retirees below the age of 60 years, who often generate income from various sources other than PGBP, could also benefit from such relaxation.” “Further, simplifying the current advance tax framework and potentially deferring advance tax liability for the first two quarters (Q1 and Q2) for individuals and new entrepreneurs merits serious consideration.This would alleviate the burden of early and potentially inaccurate income estimation, enhance cash flow management for nascent businesses, and ultimately foster a more supportive environment for taxpayers,” suggests Jhunjhunwala.","The Income-tax (I-T) Act prescribes for payment of advance taxes if a taxpayer’s liability is more than Rs. 10,000.

Differently abled need a fairer treatment under the new tax regime,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/differently-abled-need-a-fairer-treatment-under-the-new-tax-regime/articleshow/111519091.cms,"Deduction limit under section 80U

Is denial of this deduction under the new regime fair?

Since its introduction from the financial year 2020-21, the new ‘simplified’ tax regime has seen a few amendments. Under the new regime, while concessional slab rates are available to income up to Rs. 15 lakh, various exemptions be it for HRA, LTA have to be foregone. A majority of deductions available under Chapter VI-A, say for investments in a PPF (section 80C) are also not available.Even the deduction otherwise available to the differently abled under section 80U is denied.Under section 80U of the Income-tax (I-T) Act (applicable only under the old tax regime) some monetary respite is available to individuals with disabilities , depending on the degree of their disability, by offering a deduction against their total income.·For disability between 40-80% the maximum deduction allowed is Rs. 75,000·In cases of severe disability (80% or more) the deduction limit increases to Rs. 1.25 lakhA range of disabilities (set conditions are prescribed) are covered by this section, which include blindness, visual impairment, deformities arising owing to leprosy, locomotion disability, mental retardation, mental illness and multiple disabilities (combination of two or more disabilities in these specified categories). For a claim under this section a medical certificate from a recognized medical authority, specifying the nature and percentage of disability is required.The question that is being asked is whether denial of a deduction under section 80U under the new regime is fair?The Bombay Chartered Accountants Society (BCAS), a voluntary organization of chartered accountants, in its pre-budget memorandum states: Many disabled individuals need to purchase assistive devices or employ the services of an attendant or assistant to help them in their daily living activities and in their work.For example, blind individuals need to purchase screen reading software to work on computers, employ readers for reading hard-copy documents etc.The government has introduced the new tax regime and has given indications that it is the preferred tax regime. Unfortunately, by denying deductions under section 80U, the new tax regime has greatly disadvantaged the disabled taxpayers. In fact, even the amount of deduction available, which was set more than ten years ago, needs to be revised upwards, states BCAS.Vishesh Sangoi, partner at DPS & Co, a firm of chartered accountants points out that the Memorandum to the Finance Bill, 2016, which had revised the deduction limit had pointed out its necessity. “The government had clearly acknowledged the fact that the medical costs have been increasing and the needs of disabled people need to be given special emphasis. By taking away these deductions under the new tax regime, an ordinary person and a person with disability stand on the same footing as far as income tax is concerned,” said Sangoi.He adds, “Deduction u/s 80U, which is aimed at providing financial relief to individuals with disabilities, is fundamentally different from investment-based tax breaks. Unlike deductions under sections 80C or 80D, which incentivize savings and insurance investments, section 80U offers a flat deduction directly addressing the additional costs incurred due to disability. This essential support is not available under the new tax regime with its lower rates, making it crucial to understand that such deductions serve distinct purposes and should not be compared. The choice between tax regimes must consider the unique benefits that deductions like Section 80U provide, beyond mere tax savings. Inclusion of these deductions would not only provide equitable tax relief to taxpayers but also uphold the principles of fairness and inclusivity in our tax system.”Keeping in view the ground realities, BCAS has also suggested that an additional allowance of at least Rs. 50,000 in the nature of ‘care-giver allowance’ or ‘assistive devices allowance’ should be allowed to disabled individuals.","Under section 80U of the Income-tax (I-T) Act, some monetary respite is available to individuals with disabilities. For disability between 40-80% the maximum deduction allowed is Rs. 75,000. In cases of severe disability (80% or more) the deduction limit increases to Rs. 1.25 lakh.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111519150,imgsize-848614,width-400,resizemode-4/111519150.jpg"

Budget 2024 Income Tax Expectations : Ahead of the Union Budget 2024 presentation by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, the government is currently evaluating a proposal to raise the tax-deductible limit on interest income from savings accounts to Rs 25,000.This suggestion was put forward by banks during a recent meeting with key officials from the finance ministry.Banks have been advocating for deposit incentives due to increasing concerns about the widening credit-deposit ratio.""It (the suggestion) is under review, and there could be some relief for banks, which have demanded incentives to shore up deposits,"" a government official was quoted as saying in an ET report by Dheeraj Tiwari. The final decision on the proposal will be made closer to the budget announcement.Under the old tax regime, interest income up to Rs 10,000 per year from savings accounts is tax-exempt under Section 80TTA of the Income Tax Act . For senior citizens aged 60 and above, this limit is set at Rs 50,000 and includes interest income from fixed deposits under Section 80 TTB. However, these benefits were removed under the new tax regime, when it was introduced in the 2020 budget.""Both issues, including enhancement of the old limit and allowing interest income earned from savings accounts in scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) under existing regulations in the new regime, are being deliberated,"" said the person cited above, noting that banks had previously made a presentation on this matter.Also Read | Budget 2024 income tax expectations: Top 10 things FM Sitharaman should do for salaried taxpayers The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) observed in its latest Financial Stability Report that households are diversifying their financial savings, allocating more to non-banks and the capital market.The report highlighted that the growing gap is reflected in the rising credit-deposit (C-D) ratio, which peaked at 78.8% in December 2023 before moderating to 76.8% at the end of March.Recently, HDFC Bank, the country's largest private sector lender, reported a 5% sequential decline in its current account-savings account (CASA) deposits to Rs 8.63 lakh crore during the first quarter of the current financial year.","The government is evaluating a proposal to raise the tax-deductible limit on interest income from savings accounts to Rs 25,000.

Women Leaders: How cos can help women manage guilt,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/times-techies/how-cos-can-help-women-manage-guilt/articleshow/111620119.cms,"Mentorship is invaluable

One of the most important things for women to be successful is guilt management . We’re always prone to guilt trips, whatever we choose. If we choose to be at home, we are guilty, if we choose to be at work, we are guilty. This needs to be managed.Whatever choices you make, be okay with your choices.” Those were Lalitha Indrakanti’s concluding words at our webinar last week on how global capability centres ( GCCs or the tech and operations arms of MNCs) can build the next generation of women leaders .She should know. She is now CEO of Jaguar Land Rover Technology and Business Services India, and prior to that led the GCC operations of Ingka Group (which runs Ikea stores), and Cargill in India.GCCs have today become the gold standard in many areas of the Indian IT and technology industry – and indeed, of corporate India. That includes HR practices – what they provide in terms of leaves, child-care centres, insurance policies, and diversity policies .Yet, even in GCCs, women's representation in the workforce is less than 30%, and the number in leadership positions is much lower. Our webinar, in association with Nasscom, brought together three of the most accomplished GCC leaders to discuss the best strategies to address this.Veda Persad, who has spent 20 years at Northern Trust and who is now its country executive for India, said it needs to start at the recruitment stage – to ensure large numbers of women enter the workforce. “We’re human beings, we will have affinity biases, and be attracted to people who are more like us. So we need to make sure that we have panels that are diverse, and we demand this from our talent acquisition team,” she said. This is a practice that is now a core part of leading GCCs.While this is ensuring significant women numbers at the junior levels, there’s a huge drop-off of women from the workforce especially when they have children. A variety of initiatives are being used to stem this.Sindhu Gangadharan, who has been with SAP for 25 years and took over as MD of SAP Labs India five years ago, said one of the key practices in the company’s diversity & inclusion policy – which has be- come a Harvard case study – is the “returnship programme” for women.“For women who take a longer break for caregiving or childcare, we have a very structured programme. There are days when you don’t need to do your regular work. There are intermediate times in a week, where you connect with the team, and there’s a person who’s always there to just keep you abreast of everything that’s happening at work. We make sure the person feels absolutely comfortable during the break, to come back fully empowered,” she said.Another hugely successful initiative is the childcare centre. “From a study several years back, we saw the attrition rate among women, after having their second child, was in double digits. When we went into the root cause, we realised it was primarily because of a lack of childcare support . That resulted in our in-house childcare centre called SAPlings. It works beautifully,” Sindhu said.She also underscored mentorship and sponsorship programmes as absolute game changers. “When you talk about advancing women’s careers, it becomes super important that you pair experienced leaders with high-potential women. And it really helps when mentorship programmes have clear objectives, and where you can track progress,” she said.Structured programmes, Veda said, take the learnings that they themselves have benefited from, and institutionalise it, so that they can help the next wave of women.Lalitha said it would be best to encourage mentorship from more successful women leaders who are around you, “because it’s important to foster a sense of belonging to reduce stress.”Veda said they actually encourage people to find a mentor who’s not the same as them. “While there are absolutely learnings that I can take from a woman who’s gone ahead of me, and raised children while having a career, I can also learn a lot from the perspective of someone who isn’t in my same place. And that could be a woman who’s never gotten married and never had children, it could be a man, or someone anywhere on the gender spectrum, different from me,” she said.Veda said Northern Trust also makes sure there’s equal balance and proper representation among people being promoted, and the ratings they get. “It’s onerous to do, but it’s important, and it builds trust,” she said.","GCCs have today become the gold standard in many areas of the Indian IT and technology industry.

IIT: IIT-M is chasing the quantum realm with diamonds,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/times-techies/iit-m-is-chasing-the-quantum-realm-with-diamonds/articleshow/111620078.cms,"But why diamonds?

The largely dark research lab at IIT Madras is gleaming red and green as lasers pass through diamonds. The lab is part of the research centre at IIT Madras focusing on developing hardware for quantum applications, including for quantum computing and communications using diamond materials.As India places strategic importance on developing quantum technologies with the National Quantum Mission, hardware is one of the key parts of the puzzle.Despite best efforts, efficient and large-scale quantum computers are not available at present in the country.Researchers at the centre, officially called the Quantum Centre of Excellence for Diamond and Emergent Materials (QuCenDiEM), aim to develop materials, devices and instruments for various quantum technologies including quantum computing systems.“India missed the boat when the silicon revolution happened. We missed a big chunk of the (electronics) hardware market. We need to focus on the material aspect to make sure that when quantum technology comes about, we are not left behind in the hardware sector,” says Vidya Praveen Bhallamudi, assistant professor at the physics department at IIT-M.The centre at IIT Madras chose to focus on diamonds because diamonds have applications across sectors, including electronics. But more importantly, quantum objects, or qubits as they are called, lose quantum properties like entanglement and phase of their superposition state when they interact with the environment -but when isolated, they can be controlled and utilised for computation tasks. “Diamonds provide a unique platform for isolating and controlling quantum objects or qubits,” says the professor.In order to utilise the diamonds, the researchers first create defects in them called nitrogen vacancy centres. “Defects act as an artificial atom sitting inside the diamond lattice. You can isolate them well. They have magnetic and optical properties which can be utilised for quantum (devices),” says Bhallamudi.The Quantum Centre also does research on the superconducting properties of diamonds. The researchers have developed a new Boron-Doped Diamond (BDD)-based granular superconductor. MS Ramachandra Rao, principal investigator of QuCenDiEM, and a professor of the physics department at IIT Madras, says that their aim is to further the existing studies to other BDD granular-phases and use them in quantum device fabrication.","IIT Madras is focusing on developing hardware for quantum applications, including for quantum computing and communications using diamond materials.

In the sprawling landscape of technological innovation, few frontiers are as tantalising—or as complex—as quantum computing. At the forefront of this revolution stands IBM , a company with the greatest number of quantum machines in the world.Jay Gambetta, IBM fellow and VP of IBM Quantum, is one of the experts at the helm of the ambitious endeavour to build the most sophisticated quantum computers.“We’ve been working on quantum itself for a long time. Actually, IBM dates back to the early creations of quantum information,” Gambetta explains.The journey began in earnest in 2016 when IBM placed a quantum computer on the cloud, making it accessible to researchers and enthusiasts worldwide. Since then, the company has built over 70 quantum computers, with about 20 continuously available through cloud access. The impact has been significant: users have run approximately 3.2 trillion quantum circuits, resulting in some 3,000 scientific papers, says Gambetta.These aren’t your typical computers. Gambetta describes them as superconducting qubit-based machines that operate at temperatures “a thousand times colder than outer space.” Their latest reliable quantum chip boasts around 100 qubits and can perform up to 15,000 gates—quantum operations that manipulate the qubits.But the hardware is only part of the story. The real challenge, according to Gambetta, lies in making these powerful machines useful and accessible. “How do you actually make them easier to use? How do you create the software ? How do you create the mixing of classical and quantum together?”The future, as Gambetta sees it, isn’t about quantum replacing classical computing. Instead, he envisions a world where “bits, neurons, and qubits” work in concert, with CPUs, GPUs, and QPUs (quantum processing units) functioning as an integrated system.This vision is already taking shape. IBM has built its first quantum data centre in the US, with a second underway in Europe. They’ve also installed systems in local data centres in Japan, Canada, Spain, and at the Cleveland Clinic, a non-profit academic medical centre in the US, with plans for one in South Korea and a second installation in Japan.However, the path to widespread adoption is fraught with challenges. “It’s the first time the actual model of computation has changed,” Gambetta notes. This paradigm shift means that even basic mathematical operations function differently in the quantum realm.“How do you debug a quantum computer? Even answering that question is a really hard technical challenge because you can’t just go in the middle of a quantum computation and stop it, because then you kill all the quantum coherences (the qubits are sensitive and can get scrambled easily).”To bridge this gap, IBM created Qiskit, an open-source quantum computing framework. It’s become a cornerstone for quantum education and development, with India emerging as the second-largest user base globally.As quantum computing inches closer to practical applications, the need for skilled professionals grows. Gambetta emphasises the importance of a blend of mathematical prowess and coding skills. “We’re at the stage where we’re actually rewriting how computing is done,” he says, underscoring the unique opportunity this presents for aspiring quantum engineers.Looking ahead, Gambetta says IBM’s roadmap aims for quantum error correction machines by 2029, a milestone that would allow for quantum computations involving hundreds of qubits and billions of gates. Yet, Gambetta is quick to point out that the timeline for industrywide adoption remains uncertain. “The uncertainty of when this is going to have a huge inflection in the industry depends on when the algorithms are discovered,” he explains.The people that discover the algorithms will end up creating their own companies, adds Gambetta. “That’s what happened in the classical computing world.”In India, IBM’s quantum team has been actively collaborating with academic institutions and government bodies, contributing to the national quantum mission. “The biggest thing is the ecosystem work we have done,” Gambetta notes, highlighting the importance of bridging academia, industry, and government in advancing quantum technologies.As the quantum computing landscape continues to evolve, one thing is clear: the race is on to harness this transformative technology.

Claude 3.5: A basic guide to writing code using Claude 3.5,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/times-techies/a-basic-guide-to-writing-code-using-claude-3-5/articleshow/111502364.cms,"Snip from TOI e-paper

How to start

Master prompts

We asked software developers how they would use an AI assistant like Claude 3.5 Sonnet for a coding project . A frequently cited starting tip is to break down a complex problem into smaller, manageable parts. Software development , especially at the enterprise level, is a complex orchestra of parts that need to come together, so whatever your coding task is for the day, you can always get help from an AI assistant, as long as you have a specific task in mind.Shauvik Mazumdar, senior director of front-end engineering at Ascendion, says he has been amazed by Claude 3.5 Sonnet’s capabilities in generating websites, apps, and even games. “With the recent addition of ‘ artifacts ,’ it allows us to view and interact with the results in real time too.”He says if Artifacts is not enabled, you should do that by going to the left sidebar, clicking on your name, and navigating to ₹Feature Preview’, where you have the enabling feature.The next step, Shauvik says, is to get back to the chat window and type a prompt to get your project started.If you’ve been tasked with creating a login page for a business, you could create a prompt like this:Design a login page (plain html). The login form needs to have a username and password as the first step. It also needs a ₹forgot password’ feature. Further on successful login, it should show Multifactor authentication. Use Material stylesheet and do basic validation. To test the system, you can use user name and default password like admin, admin and OTP as 1111. On successful login a message should be shown.“Claude will generate the code and an HTML version of the login page side-by-side.You can quickly test the output and instruct Claude to refine it. For plain HTML and vanilla JavaScript, Claude typically provides a demo. It can also generate Angular or React code, though not a live demo as of now,” says Shauvik.Once you have your code, test it, starting with small, isolated tests, before integrating it into larger systems, says Arun Prakash Agrawal, professor & head of the department of computer science & applications at Sharda School of Engineering and Technology in Greater Noida.Maintaining a comprehensive documentation of the code and decisions made during the project, Arun says, will aid in debugging and future maintenance.Mastering the art of writing prompts might be the most crucial skill to gain to make your coding journey more productive. This is the method by which a developer communicates with AI systems, and so being clear and concise is crucial.“Developers need to be specific, and provide proper context to a problem statement. Breaking down tasks, giving examples of similar codes, and asking for code comments will help the prompt responses to be more aligned with the desired outcome. A basic prompt can be refined through proper feedback,” says Deepak Visweswaraiah, VP of platform engineering, and site MD at Pegasystems, India.Vijay Navaluri, co-founder at Supervity, says structuring interactions as multi-turn conversations is also beneficial for complex tasks, as it allows the model to build on previous responses and maintain context.","Claude 3.5 Sonnet can generate websites, apps, and even games.

AI has become a crucial part of our present truth, remodelling industries and redefining the employment landscape. As AI continues to strengthen at an exponential scale, it is critical for experts to stay informed about the emerging job roles that will form the future of work. Here we look at four AI process titles which look set to play pivotal roles in the coming years.With the increasing integration of AI into various aspects of our lives, the need for responsible and ethical AI improvement has increased even more.AI ethicists are the guardians of this obligation, making sure that AI technologies are designed, developed, and deployed in a manner that upholds moral ideas and considers the societal impact.Examine AI systems for bias, broaden ethical frameworks, advise businesses on responsible AI practices, and engage in public conversations on AI ethics.A strong knowledge of ethical principles, understanding of AI technology, communication and critical thinking capabilities, and a background in philosophy, regulation, or social sciences are beneficial.AI algorithms, much like humans, require continuous training for better inferencing. AI engineers are the ones responsible for continuously training the AI models with relevant data and instructions for continuous upgrades.Prepare and label datasets, develop training parameters, continuously monitor, and evaluate model performance, and further fine tune algorithms to enhance model accuracies.Expertise in machine learning and deep learning techniques, data analysis, programming knowledge (Python, R), and familiarity with AI tools and technologies are desired skill sets.With AI-powered applications and devices becoming more prevalent, the necessity of seamless and intuitive human-computer interaction has increased.AI interaction designers bridge the distance between AI technology and their user interaction, creating user friendly interfaces and experiences.Design conversational interfaces for chatbots and digital assistants, develop consumer-focused frontend for AI products, and perform A/B testing to understand user needs and preferences.Expertise in user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design principles, knowledge of human-computer interaction, understanding of AI capabilities and limitations, and effective communication and collaboration skills are crucial for this role.Ensuring the safety and security of AI systems is of utmost significance. AI safety engineers are required to ensure that.Perform risk assessments of AI systems, develop safety protocols and mitigation techniques, put in place security features to defend AI systems from cyber threats, and stay up to date on the latest research on AI safety.A strong understanding of cybersecurity ideas, knowledge of AI algorithms and architectures, experience with cybersecurity testing and vulnerability assessment, along with problem solving and analytical skill sets are essential.Sukanya Mandal is a member of IEEE, the world’s largest technical professional organisation"," AI has become a crucial part of our present truth, remodelling industries and redefining the employment landscape.

Evolutionary AI: Evolutionary AI is a powerful answer to complex problems,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/times-techies/evolutionary-ai-is-a-powerful-answer-to-complex-problems/articleshow/111501685.cms,"Real-world use cases

Last week on our webinar, we had three experts – Risto Miikkulainen, Babak Hodjat, and Amir Banifatemi — in the field of what’s called evolutionary AI who painted a vivid picture of the innovative technology and its potential to reshape decision making across industries.Miikkulainen, VP of AI research at Cognizant and professor of computer science at the University of Texas at Austin, and a pioneer in the field of evolutionary AI, explains that evolutionary AI takes its cues from biology, much like neural networks .However, unlike most machine learning techniques that rely on supervised learning with clearly defined targets, evolutionary AI thrives in scenarios with weaker feedback. It can navigate complex problem spaces without predetermined answers.While traditional AI might excel at recognising patterns – like identifying a dog in an image – Miikkulainen says stopping at just prediction is akin to “leaving money on the table”. Instead, evolutionary AI goes a step further: it doesn’t just predict, it suggests actions. By simulating a population of potential solutions and allowing them to “evolve” towards better outcomes, evolutionary AI can uncover novel strategies that even human experts might overlook.As Hodjat, CTO of AI at Cognizant, puts it, evolutionary AI is more aligned with the way we go about making decisions. In the real world, decisions often involve balancing multiple, sometimes conflicting objectives. Evolutionary AI excels here, says Hodjat, offering a range of strategies that balance various outcomes, allowing decision-makers to choose the most suitable approach.“Look at the pandemic, you want to reduce the number of cases, but at the same time you don’t want to have a major economic impact on people’s livelihoods. Evolutionary AI is very good at coming up with strategies that give us a balance of multiple outcomes and lets us then choose which balance of outcomes is more interesting to us.”Hodjat describes a two-step process: first, using AI to create “predictors” that forecast outcomes based on different decisions. Then, evolutionary algorithms search the vast space of possible strategies to find optimal solutions. This approach, he argues, mirrors human decision making processes, allowing for scenario testing and collaborative refinement between AI and human experts.Banifatemi, technology and innovation strategist for AI Commons, a nonprofit that seeks to bring the benefits of AI to everyone, high lights evolutionary AI’s creative potential. Unlike traditional AI that derives solutions from existing knowledge, evolutionary algorithms, he says, can create entirely new solutions. This creativity, coupled with the ability to optimise for multiple objectives simultaneously, makes evolutionary AI a powerful tool for tackling complex, multifaceted problems.Banifatemi also points out a crucial advantage: transparency. While many AI models operate as “black boxes,” the solutions generated by evolutionary AI are often more explainable. This transparency is vital in fields where understanding the reasoning behind a decision is as important as the decision itself.Miikkulainen describes an agricultural experiment where evolutionary AI discovered that basil thrives under 24-hour light – a counterintuitive finding that challenged biologists’ assumptions. The experiment involved planting about 300 basil plants and providing them with different amounts of light, water, nutrients, temperature, etc. “Most of them were recipes that the biologists came up with – the usual suspects. But we also had some exploratory examples. And so, we now had 300 points about how the plant grows under different conditions. And then we built a predictive model . We could then come up with crazy recipes and ask the model what would happen in different scenarios. It so happened that we had initially set up a limitation of six hours of darkness. But then we said, let’s open it up to try other solutions. And to the biologists’ big surprise, the model found basil thrives when lights were on 24 hours. This is the kind of solution that will be difficult for humans to discover because they have all kinds of assumptions and evolutionary AI does not,” Miikkulainen says.Banifatemi says evolutionary AI is also showing a lot of promise in pharmaceutical research, particularly for rare diseases where traditional approaches fall short. “For rare diseases, from a pharmaceutical perspective, a number of drug candidates need to be identified. And while the cost of drug research is huge, the market is not that large. With evolutionary AI you can find a cluster of potential molecules for a given set of constraints: like for toxicity, or for a particular genetic background. This accelerates drug research,” he says.The story of evolutionary AI is still unfolding. As researchers and companies like Cognizant continue to invest in and develop this technology, more innovative applications will emerge – and some could come from Cognizant’s India offices. “Cognizant has a very strong presence in India and we have colleagues in India that are well versed in using evolutionary AI,” says Hodjat."," evolutionary AI takes its cues from biology, much like neural networks.

Industry needs to boost capital investments to capitalise on growth opportunities: Anand Mahindra,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/times-techies/industry-needs-to-boost-capital-investments-to-capitalise-on-growth-opportunities-anand-mahindra/articleshow/111465064.cms,"NEW DELHI: Indian companies need to enhance capital investment in order to take advantage of the growth opportunities available in India and abroad, according to Mahindra Group Chairman Anand Mahindra .Addressing shareholders in the company's annual report for 2023-24, the leading industrialist noted that the interplay of geopolitics and economic linkages in the post-Covid era has seen India's position strengthen.India's emerging role as one of the vital nodes in future-proofed supply chains across industries opens the door for growth within the country and expansion beyond, he stated.""How can we, in private industry , ensure that we ride this upsurging tide? ..In the spirit of 'ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country', I would argue that the most important thing industry can do at this critical juncture is to increase private investment ,"" Mahindra said.Private capital investment is the key to capitalising on this opportunity as it is a key driver of growth, jobs, and demand, he stated.After the economic reforms of the 1990s, private investment rose from around 10 per cent to around 27 per cent of GDP, however, from 2011-12 onwards, private investment as a percentage of GDP has been falling to a worrisome level, Mahindra stated.""We need to remedy that situation,"" he added.Mahindra noted that the problem is not one of resources—rather, it is one of mindset.Particularly after Covid, Indian companies have become increasingly risk averse, sticking to the tried and true rather than blazing new trails, he said.""To some extent, this is understandable. But when opportunity beckons, when private industry can make a significant difference, it is time to set aside our fear of failure and take a leap of faith and self-belief,"" he noted.It is undoubtedly a good time to be an Indian company, Mahindra said.""The interplay of geopolitics and economic linkages in the post-COVID era has seen India's position strengthen. A new multi-polar manufacturing world is emerging, as nations and companies rush to reconfigure their supply chains to be more resilient and diversified. India has emerged as a key beneficiary,"" he added.For private industry, particularly manufacturing, this confluence of factors translates into an excellent chance to be a serious player in this new, multi-polar world, Mahindra stated.He noted that India has been heavily investing in infrastructure and logistics and the country has become the cheapest manufacturing destination in the world.""Externally too, conditions are working in our favour. It's time to seize the day,"" he stated.Elaborating on the Mahindra Group, he said, ""On the back of this rising tide, we are stepping up our investments. We have already announced an investment of Rs 37,000 crore across our auto, farm and services businesses (excluding Tech Mahindra) in FY25, FY26 and FY27.""These investments will, to a large extent, go towards building capacity, with a pipeline of 26 new models/facelifts in the next 5 years, he said.The valuation of the company's growth gems increased over fourfold in the last four years, Mahindra said.The contribution of services businesses (Mahindra Finance, Tech Mahindra and growth gems) to M&M's net cash generation was almost Rs 7,000 crore over the FY22-FY24 period, he said.Mahindra & Mahindra MD and CEO Anish Shah said the company recognises the fact that private capital investment plays a crucial role in maximising the opportunities in India.""By outlining a capex plan of Rs 37,000 crore for the next three years, we remain committed to our proven strategy of prudent capital allocation,"" he stated.The Mahindra Group draws confidence from the cash generation across businesses, low debt levels, and a robust balance sheet, he added.",The interplay of geopolitics and economic linkages in the post-Covid era has seen India's position strengthen.

Jerome Powell: More good inflation data would boost Fed confidence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/jerome-powell-more-good-inflation-data-would-boost-fed-confidence/articleshow/111612325.cms,"Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said “more good data” would strengthen confidence that inflation is moving down toward the US central bank’s 2% target, and recent readings point to “modest further progress” on prices.In testimony prepared for a Senate hearing Tuesday, Powell warned that lowering interest rates too little or too late could put the economy and the labor market at risk.“Elevated inflation is not the only risk we face,” he told lawmakers on the first of two days of congressional testimony. “Reducing policy restraint too late or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment.”The Fed chair also said cutting rates too soon or too much could stall or reverse inflation progress.“More good data would strengthen our confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2%,” Powell told the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs in prepared remarks. He testifies Wednesday before the House Financial Services Committee.US central bankers are aiming to bring inflation back to the 2% goal following a post-pandemic surge in prices. While the labor market has held up under pressure from higher interest rates, an uptick in the unemployment rate has added political pressure on Fed officials to start reducing borrowing costs.Powell’s remarks suggest the Federal Open Market Committee is unlikely to reduce rates when it meets at the end of this month.Treasury yields oscillated but were higher on the day and the S&P 500 index remained higher after Powell’s testimony was released.Traders are pricing in a just over 70% probability that the Fed first cuts rates in September. They see two quarter-point rate reductions in 2024.Fed officials have welcomed recent data indicating inflation is decelerating again following a jump in prices at the start of the year, though several other policymakers have also said they need more confidence that the trend will continue before reducing borrowing costs.The Fed’s preferred inflation measure rose 2.6% in the 12 months through May, down from 7.1% in June 2022. While unemployment remains low at 4.1%, it has ticked up in each of the last three months.A number of economists are warning that there’s a slowdown afoot in the job market that could worsen. The number of people who have been looking for a job for 15 weeks or more rose in June to the highest level since early 2022, when that measure was rapidly declining.Powell called the labor market “strong, but not overheated,” adding that the central bank’s restrictive stance is working to bring supply and demand into better balance.“Another increase in the jobless rate in the July report could challenge our base case of one rate cut this year in December, raising the possibility of two cuts starting in September,” said Yelena Shulyatyeva, senior economist at BNP Paribas.The Fed has held its policy rate at what it describes as a restrictive level of 5.25% to 5.5% for a year. Futures traders have almost fully priced in a cut for the Sept 17-18 policy meeting, less than two months before the US election.","Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell testifies before a Senate committee.

It would also be subject to a period of court-supervised probation.The Justice Department determined in May that Boeing breached a 2021 deferred-prosecution agreement tied to the crashes that was struck in the waning days of the Trump Administration. That followed the blowout of a fuselage panel on a 737 Max 9 on Jan 5, just days before the deal was set to expire.The guilty plea marks a low point in the company's century-long history after years of turmoil sparked by two crashes of its 737 Max aircraft in 2018 and 2019 that killed 346 people.

SEATTLE: “IT’S TIME TO EARN IT BACK!!!” Reads the last line (in screaming all capital letters) of a notice board at Boeing ’s Renton final assembly line (FLA) in Seattle where the ill-famed MAX version of the once best-selling B737s are rolled out. It reminds technicians at work here that “737 conformance rate for multiple (assembly) processes have dropped below confidence level” and that the goal is to “ensure a conforming product (for) our customers.”Following two deadly crashes that left 346 people dead; subsequent global grounding for 21 months and a mid-air door blowout involving the MAX in last six years, the 108-year-old aerospace major is battling the biggest crisis of its lifetime — including potential criminal charges by the US justice department.The old slogan “if it’s not Boeing, I am not going,” is a distant memory at least for now.Amid belated enhanced oversight by America’s Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) as a consequence of the MAX mishaps, Boeing is trying hard to win the trust back. It recently opened the doors of its single (737) and twin (777) aisle FLAs in Seattle to a section of the world’s media, including TOI. The senior management there admitted of lapses in recent years, while assuring corrective steps are being taken. Process heads spoke of bringing back checks & balances that had been done away with, in pursuit of churning out planes quickly.Clearly, there’s a lot of work to be done to regain the confidence. Multiple aerospace industry insiders in the US who worked for or with Boeing said the focus in last few years had shifted from engineering excellence to financial performance. “I used to be with a supply chain partner and we were constantly asked to cut corners to reduce cost of our supplies. Beyond a point, it became difficult to work with Boeing,” said an engineer in San Francisco who did not want to be named.The final straw proved to be the most recent MAX scare — Jan 5, 2024, door plug blowout on an Alaska Air B737-9 MAX in the US. Elizabeth Lund, Boeing’s senior VP (quality) says the company’s first reaction “was to take immediate action to ensure that no airplane ever leads our factory that could cause an accident. I will tell you very transparently.”She gave an exhaustive list of steps taken to spruce up safety, including something as basic as spelling out the task required in simple English; end of line inspection for critical systems; ensuring work not completed in a process does not travel to the next stage of FLA; enhanced workforce training; eliminating defects and 100% following of safety and quality management systems.“We knew we needed to address systemic issues. The first is workforce experience. We have brought in so many employees since Covid and it overlapped with the time of the MAX grounding (March 2019-Dec 2020). We didn’t actually do an involuntary layoff but we didn’t get them (many of those who left) back. When we came out of the MAX grounding, we were back flying again. We were coming out of Covid and the market came back, incredibly fast at that point. We were hiring lots and lots of people in a short period of time (many) with less experience. (And in) many cases, no aerospace experience. Our build plans are at times complicated. Particularly for a new employee with no aerospace experience. Perhaps they speak English as a second language, (making things) even more complicated,” she said.Elizabeth Lund (Image credit: Saurabh Sinha)Boeing then started using artificial intelligence to go from “engineering English” to “more clear” English. So Instead of saying Boeing wants a 0.375 (unit of measure) hole plus or minus 0.05, it now says the hole should be between 0.356 and 0.393. Many newcomers were found to be “struggling to do jobs correctly”. So Boeing says it overhauled its foundational training and linked it to proficiency testing.A key challenge for the leadership is to keep the workforce morale high as it tries to the with the world’s confidence in its planes. “We are humans and are affected by what has unfortunately happened in the recent past,” said a technician at the MAX assembly line. Katie Ringgold, VP of the 737 programme and Renton site leader, had one request for the media during the shop floor visit, “Keep the tough questions for me and the leadership (and not pose them to the technicians there).”Jason Clark, VP & GM of the B777 programme and Everett site leader, said “employee involvement (EI) — where workers discuss production issues regularly — has been brought back over a month back. “It was done away with as there was a lot of overlap. By doing so, we lost the voice of the mechanic. Now we have again created groups for mechanics to discuss and fix problems,” Clark said.The increased focus on safety and checks has meant FAA asked Boeing to churn out a lot fewer that the 38 allowed B737 MAX per month. Customer airlines, including Air India Express and Akasa, don’t know what will be the delivery schedule of their ordered MAX. The popular Dreamliner (B787) production, assembled at a FLA in Charleston in South Carolina, is also hit. “The production programme in Charleston has been slowed down to stability due to supply chain issues. The steadfast focus is on fey and processes. We will up the rate in next few years and return to five 787s per month later in 2024,” said Scott Stocker, VP & GM B787 programme and South Carolina site leader.Following the Indonesian Lion Air B737 MAX crash in October 2018; Ethiopian B737 MAX crash in March 2019, these planes were grounded globally. They were allowed to resume flying in Dec 2020 after Boeing assured all required corrective action has been taken. Then the door plug blowout happened this Jan on a US carrier.Asked why should anyone believe Boeing that it is actually all that is required to make safe planes, Lund admitted she gets that question as lot. “After the Max crashes we took (many) positive steps. We (created) a separate organisation focused on safety. Just a couple of days (later) I took over this position. There were various levels of internal audit for our production system focused on quality…. We are a company deeply committed to flying safety; to public safety and to our employees. I believe (the current) plan will make us stronger. We are transparent with you (media), with our regulators and our customers. We have opened our factories up to our customers so that they can come in. The regulator has access to all of our data. There is no hidden agenda. There is no hidden data. We are a transparent company who deeply cares about safety and the public and our employees and we are committed to be better every day,” Lund tried to reassure.“We have for years dedicated to making air transportation as safe as humanly possible and continue that way. I believe that the actions we have taken for many years have allowed air transportation to be the safest means of transportation. We have taken steps to address (safety issues) and continue to do so,” she said.Boeing says it has used the Alaska Air door plug-out to “to step back, holistically look at everything and be very introspective. To see what else could we do? How can we be certain that our system is as absolutely robust as possible. So we started collecting input from many many sources.” Boeing received over 30,000 ideas, pain points and areas for improvement across the board, apart from directives of FAA auditors, which are the “primary foundation” of the make-planes-safe-again plan.“How we make sure we make the perfect airplane? The first is invest in workforce training. The second is simplify plans and processes. The third eliminate defects both coming in and that we create and the fourth, elevate our safety and quality,” Lund said.“A defect, non-conforming rivets, arrived from our supplier which in themselves did not create a safety hazard but needed to be fixed. The airplane then traveled throughout the factory. It moved to the end of the (FLA) line while we discussed with our supplier back and forth. By the time we all reached agreement that the rivets needed to be removed and replaced, we had a non-compliance to our process,” Lund said.That plug was opened “without correct documentation and paperwork”. Boeing has a “loop crew” who just button the airplane up for weather when it rolls out of the factory. “In this case, they closed the plug. They did not reinstall the retaining pins. That is not their job. Their job is to just close it and they count on existing paperwork…. The last step is what we call an okay to close. The the plug had a little bit of a fit. That’s how it was able to fly for roughly 150 cycles (before the blowout happened)… A defect entered our system from our supply chain which travelled throughout our final assembly. And then there was a lack of compliance to our processes,” Lund added.Speaking about this under investigation case has earned Boeing the ire of US regulatory agencies.The reporter was in Seattle at the invitation of Boeing.","Boeing is battling the biggest crisis of its lifetime — including potential criminal charges by the US justice department.

Rheinmetall and Leonardo's agreement seen as key to EU defence consolidation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/rheinmetall-and-leonardos-agreement-seen-as-key-to-eu-defence-consolidation/articleshow/111500424.cms,"Germany's Rheinmetall and Italy's Leonardo have formed a joint venture to consolidate the European defence vehicle sector .The chief executive of the two groups Armin Papperger of Rheinmetall and Roberto Cingolani of Leonardo has expressed their optimism about the partnership on Thursday.Papperger stated that the agreement has the potential to capitalize on a European market worth over 50 billion euros ($53.99 billion), according to Reuters.""My expectation is that, with (this) cooperation only on the vehicle side, there is a market of more than 50 bln euros, a huge market that we can conquer,"" Papperger said in a recorded message posted online.""We can help Europe grow, together, and this is a very first small step on the vehicle side for consolidation on the European level,"" he added.The formation of this joint venture could accelerate the consolidation of defence assets across Europe, a process that has been hindered by diverging national interests. However, Russia's ongoing conflict with Ukraine has raised hopes for more concerted efforts in this direction. Germany, for instance, is currently considering partnering with Carlyle, a private equity firm, to jointly acquire a majority stake in Thyssenkrupp's submarines and frigates division.The alliance between Rheinmetall and Leonardo aligns with the broader objective of both groups to create pan-European consortia for the development of new combat systems.Cingolani stated, ""The target is to create a machine that is cutting-edge for the future. A machine that is cross-domain and interoperable, talking, in the future, to satellites, helicopters and aircraft.""On Wednesday, the companies announced that they have agreed to form a joint venture to produce tanks and other land defence systems, reported Reuters.The first goal of the 50-50 enterprise, which will be headquartered in Italy, will be to develop the Italian Main Battle Tank and Armoured Infantry Combat System for the Italian Army, they said in a joint statement.",Germany's Rheinmetall and Italy's Leonardo have formed a joint venture to consolidate the European defence vehicle sector. The agreement has the potential to capitalize on a European market worth over 50 billion euros ($53.99 billion) The formation of this joint venture could accelerate the consolidation of defence assets across Europe.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111500698,imgsize-110608,width-400,resizemode-4/111500698.jpg"
