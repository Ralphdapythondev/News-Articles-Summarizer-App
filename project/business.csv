How Xi Jinping can surprise world with big-bang moves,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/how-xi-jinping-can-surprise-world-with-big-bang-moves/articleshow/111651557.cms,"China has the firepower to end its housing crisis at a high-stakes policy meeting, including with a “big-bang solution” that involves pumping money like the Federal Reserve. But it’s unlikely to pull the trigger.That’s according to Bloomberg Economics, which said if the People’s Bank of China printed money on a scale similar to the Fed during the global financial crisis, it could finance the purchase of about 70% of the unsold property stock.“That’s a big-bang solution that would result in significant collateral damage — we don’t think Beijing would go that far,” economists David Qu and Chang Shu said. “Still, it shows the potential for policy solutions.”The Third Plenum, set for July 15-18, is one of the most important political meetings of the Chinese Communist Party . It’s expected to unveil a series of economic reforms and policies aimed at addressing long-standing issues that have impeded growth and recovery. Property polices are a key area of focus, as the real estate downturn remains the biggest threat to the economy.The PBOC in May announced a $41 billion program to help state-owned firms buy unsold housing stock. “That’s a promising approach, but so far insufficient to address the scale of the problem,” the Bloomberg economists wrote in a note. This would pay for less than 1% of unsold housing inventory, they said.Bloomberg Economics looked at three scenarios for how much money the PBOC could print to help local governments buy up unsold houses.If the PBOC expanded its balance sheet by about 24 trillion yuan ($3.3 trillion yuan) — similar to what the Fed did from 2008 to 2014 — it would pay for around 70% of the unsold housing stock in China.An expansion of 13 trillion yuan — similar to the European Central Bank from 2009 to 2012 after the European debt crisis — would finance the purchase of about 40% of the inventory.The flip side is that quantitative easing of this scale would come at the cost of rapidly rising debt, pressure on the yuan to fall, faster inflation and much heavier debt loads for state-owned firms and local governments, Bloomberg Economics said.The most likely option would resemble China’s “shanty-town redevelopment” program from 2015 to 2018, which tore down older homes nationwide and replaced them with new apartments. A repeat of this program, with the central bank providing 3.6 trillion yuan to banks, would finance the purchase of 10% of the stock of unsold homes.It could also provide low-cost homes for 1.6% of China’s population, Bloomberg Economics said. This would raise growth by 0.2 percentage points this year and a full percentage point in both 2025 and 2026, they estimate, as banks make more loans and confidence would increase due to the support.“Of course, quantitative easing is not a free lunch,” the economists wrote. “Adding to yuan depreciation pressure, renewing moral hazard and zeroing out future policy space are among the costs.”","China has the firepower to end its housing crisis, including with a “big-bang solution” that involves pumping money like the Federal Reserve.

Budget 2024 expectations : Ahead of the upcoming Union Budget 2024 presentation on July 23 by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman , the government is weighing a proposal to significantly raise the minimum guaranteed amount under its flagship social security initiative , the Atal Pension Yojana (APY).Currently, the scheme offers a guaranteed minimum pension ranging from Rs 1,000 to Rs 5,000 per month, depending on the subscriber's contributions.However, according to an ET report, in a move aimed at enhancing social security benefits, the Modi government is contemplating doubling this amount to Rs 10,000 per month. The decision on this proposal is expected closer to the budget date.The potential hike in APY benefits comes amidst efforts to strengthen India's social security framework, aligning with the imminent rollout of the labour code on social security.As of June 20, the Atal Pension Yojana has garnered over 66.2 million enrolments, with 12.2 million new accounts added in the fiscal year 2023-24 alone.""Some proposals have been made for making the Atal Pension Yojana more attractive, including increasing the guaranteed amount.

Notably, individuals liable to pay income tax are excluded from enrolling in the scheme, reinforcing its focus on supporting economically disadvantaged groups.","The government is weighing a proposal to significantly raise the minimum guaranteed amount under its flagship social security initiative, the Atal Pension Yojana.

Budget 2024 expectations : India has shown remarkable progress in the field of health and nutrition. Presently, over 50 crore Indians benefit from the Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB-PMJAY), ensuring their access to healthcare. The country has established 1.73 lakh Ayushman Aarogya Mandirs (AAMs) to offer comprehensive primary healthcare services.Over the past decade, the number of medical education seats for both under- and post-graduate programmes has more than doubled. Moreover, the out-of-pocket health expenditure has decreased from 63% in 2014 to 39% in 2024.Nevertheless, India still has a considerable distance to cover in comparison to global standards as it aims for Viksit Bharat @ 2047. The current life expectancy in India stands at 71 years, whereas it is 77 in China, 84 in Japan, and 75 in Brazil. India's Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) is 28 per 1000 live births, contrasting with 5 in China and less than 2 in Japan. South Africa's out-of-pocket health expenditure accounts for only about 8% of the total, in contrast to India's 39%.Presently, there are 10 doctors and 17 nurses and midwives per 10,000 individuals in India. In comparison, middle-income countries like China and Brazil have 17 doctors and 40 nurses and midwives per 10,000 persons, while high-income countries like the US and Australia have 39 doctors and 120 nurses and midwives per 10,000 individuals.Also Read | Budget 2024: Top 3 steps Modi government should consider for employment generation Countries such as Singapore, Taiwan, and South Korea have demonstrated the potential of harnessing the demographic dividend to achieve remarkable economic growth through the implementation of progressive policies and initiatives aimed at empowering the youth in making informed health choices. The allocation of adequate funds for the health sector in the Union Budget 2024-25 is of utmost importance. According to theNational Health Policy (NHP) 2017, India's healthcare expenditure should reach 2.5% of GDP by 2024-25.Notably, public healthcare spending in India encompasses health, family welfare, AYUSH, medical research, and water supply and sanitation. While some states have exceeded the 8% target outlined in the NHP 2017, others fall short, highlighting disparities in healthcare expenditure across states. Therefore, the central government plays a crucial role in augmenting state health expenditure to promote greater equity nationwide. Increased funding for nutrition, clean drinking water, and sanitation is also critical. The Budget 2024-25 should prioritize efforts to eradicate childhood undernutrition and anaemia among women and children.It is vital to increase investment in the health of children and adolescents, with a particular focus on early childhood development, care, and education for children aged 0–6 years. The first 1000 days of life, from a woman’s pregnancy to her child’s second birthday, present a unique opportunity to establish the foundation for lifelong health and development. Adequate nutrition and care during this period not only impact a child’s survival but also her ability to thrive, learn, and break the cycle of poverty. Strengthening the existing 14 lakh Anganwadi Centers and providing adequate training to staff in child development and learning, could have a significant impact.Also Read | Budget 2024: 7 structural reforms FM Nirmala Sitharaman should target for sustainable growth One crucial aspect to consider is the health of students in schools. The school-age phase is a key time for the body to start storing nutrients, which aids in rapid growth. Focusing on school children is essential for India to harness the potential of its young population, who will play a vital role in the future workforce and contribute to improving the nation's socio-economic status.Introducing a nationwide school health initiative can ensure the overall well-being of 255 million school children and teenagers aged 6-18, with a focus on physical and mental health, nutrition, wellness, and promoting a healthy lifestyle. Creating a school environment that encourages health and nutrition through activities such as yoga, physical education, mental health support, counselling, and regular health check-ups should be a top priority.The healthcare system's foundation is rooted in primary healthcare, which is essential for achieving the desired health outcomes by 2047. The future well-being of citizens depends heavily on the efficient delivery of services through our AAMs. Therefore, the transformation of all AAMs must be completed by 2027. Since 2018, the primary healthcare platform has been established with 173,000 AAMs, along with the deployment of community health officers, infrastructure upgrades, telemedicine services, and provision of free drugs and diagnostics.However, challenges related to full operationalization, coverage, quality, and continuity persist across states. The implementation of half of the package focusing on mental health, acute care, geriatric care, oral, visual, and ENT treatments, and emergency services needs to be improved. The other half of the package, which has been implemented, faces challenges with the inconsistent availability of medications and diagnostics at some AAMs. Although screenings for hypertension and diabetes have commenced, the emphasis also needs to be on treatment, follow-ups, and other services.

Budget 2024 expectations : All eyes are on Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, who will present the Union Budget 2024 , on July 23. The logistics sector is especially hopeful, given the Rs 11 lakh crore boost allocated by the Interim Budget in February, by way of three major economic railway corridor programmes, including energy, mineral and cement corridors, port connectivity corridors, and high-traffic density corridors, under the PM Gati Shakti scheme .Looking ahead, we perceive the upcoming budget presenting a unique opportunity to balance the nation’s economic growth priorities with fiscal consolidation.To sustain the growth momentum of the logistics sector, prioritising capital expenditure in key infrastructure projects, alongside financial incentives such as PLI, tax benefits and subsidies are crucial as these will help drive innovation in logistics. Further, establishing a ‘One India’ logistics ecosystem and integrating initiatives such as the National Logistics Policy and Sagarmala Project are crucial in terms of enhancing India’s ranking on the global Logistics Performance Index. To reinforce India’s potential as a manufacturing powerhouse, the budget must focus on domestic manufacturing, and on preparing the logistics sector for service integration, growth in fulfilment logistics and multi-modal transportation adoption. The government should also consider automation investments, especially in technologically advanced warehouses, which can position India as a logistics innovation leader.We anticipate a stronger push for the EV industry, in the form of tax incentives, charging infrastructure subsidies and financial support for R&D. Establishing a holistic regulatory framework for last-mile delivery and formal recognition of the gig workforce under labour laws are essential to ensure fair employment practices in today’s digital economy.The logistics industry is a crucial driver of economic efficiency, and we are hopeful for the budget to include transformative measures that will drive innovation and inclusivity in the sector. We urge the government to address the logistics sector’s unique needs by enhancing the strategic allocations towardinfrastructure development , tax reforms and other governance policies. Besides this, a renewed focus on setting up digitally advanced processes with the use of cutting-edge technologies including artificial intelligence, machine learning, IoT, and big data will streamline efficiency.We hope the government will consider the inclusion of diesel under the GST ambit as this is a critical move in enabling India to reduce its logistics costs and become more competitive in the international market. It will also help key logistics players to regulate costs by cutting down on tax outflows.As we await the release of the Interim Budget, the logistics sector is primed for transformative measures that will fuel our nation’s journey to a USD 5 trillion economy. The forthcoming budget presents a significant opportunity to reinforce our commitment to enhancing the ease of doing business with India. India’s logistics costs, as highlighted by DPIIT, are encouraging; but our gaze must look beyond mere cost considerations. A strategic allocation of resources towards infrastructure, competence and traceability is essential for sustained progress.A sustained focus on and adopting a long-term perspective towards building key physical and digital infrastructure, incentivising multimodal logistics for carbon reduction, and robust skilling initiatives for the 22 million individuals employed in the sector should be the key priorities for the upcoming budget. To boost EXIM trade and improve competitiveness, we must maintain the momentum in investments and digitalisation. This approach will empower India to progress rapidly towards a more resilient and sustainable transport and logistics ecosystem.","All eyes are on Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, who will present the Union Budget 2024, on July 23.

Government to Guarantee 50% Pension Under NPS for Central Govt Employees,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/government-may-offer-guarantee-under-nps-to-allay-fears/articleshow/111615520.cms,"NEW DELHI: Govt is looking to assure central govt employees who are part of the National Pension System of 50% of the last pay drawn as pension as it seeks to address their concerns over the payout. This is despite the scheme for those recruited from 2004 currently offering high returns for those who stay invested for 25-30 years.A committee headed by finance secretary T V Somanathan had been set up after an announcement by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman.While the Centre has ruled out a return to the Old Pension Scheme (OPS), it kept the window open to provide a certain level of comfort at a time when Congress was announcing a reversal of a decision taken by the Manmohan Singh govt.OPS is a defined benefit scheme, offering half the last salary drawn as pension for life and subject to adjustments in line with pay commission recommendations. In contrast, NPS is a defined contribution scheme where a govt employee provides 10% of the basic salary as his/her contribution and the Centre provides 14%.While the Somanathan committee has looked at the global experience, as well as the results of the tweak undertaken by the Andhra Pradesh govt, it has also carried out extensive calculations to gauge the impact of providing an assured return. Although it is possible for the Centre to offer 40-45% guarantee, politically, it does not address the concern of employees who work for 25-30 years. As a result, there is growing acknowledgement within the govt of offering a 50% guarantee. Which means in case of a shortfall, the govt will fill the gap.Also Read | Budget 2024 income tax expectations: Top 10 things FM Sitharaman should do for salaried taxpayers This means that an annual estimation will also need to be undertaken as several committee members are of the view that unlike the govt pension system, which is unfunded as the Centre does not have a retirement fund . It is likely that the Centre will this time also create a fund that will set aside money, as is the case with companies that have retiral benefits for their employees.Officials have maintained that those who stay employed for 25-30 years are seeing adequate returns to match the pension payment of those under OPS and the complaints of low payouts was only coming from those who have exited the scheme so far, having completed 20 years or less.",The scheme for those recruited from 2004 currently offers high returns for those who stay invested for 25-30 years.

The writer is CMD, Indian Energy Exchange.

Budget 2024 expectations : As Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman prepares to present the Union Budget this month, the Modi 3.0 government aims to bolster the Indian economy with a keen focus on infrastructure. A critical component of this infrastructure is the power sector, where power exchanges can play a transformative role in enhancing efficiency, transparency, and competitive price discovery.Power exchanges are pivotal in India's power sector, offering over 25 contracts across various market segments and trading more than 120 billion units (BUs) annually. Despite this, power exchanges account for only about 7% of the country's total power generation, a stark contrast to European countries where over 50% of generation is traded through exchanges. This discrepancy underscores the significant growth potential for India's power exchanges.Recognizing the importance of a robust power market, the government’s Draft National Electricity Policy aims to increase the share of spot markets to 25% by 2030. This policy aligns with India's commitment to reducing the emission intensity of its GDP by 45% from 2005 levels and achieving net-zero emissions by 2070. To support these goals, the government plans to have 50% of installed generation capacity from non-fossil sources by 2030, necessitating around 500 GW ofrenewable energy (RE) capacity.The integration of renewable energy (RE) into India's grid can be significantly accelerated through power exchanges. Renewable sources often exhibit variability and intermittent generation, posing challenges for forecasting. Power exchanges offer solutions such as the Day Ahead Market (DAM) and Real Time Market (RTM), which provide flexible trading options to manage these fluctuations effectively.International examples illustrate how power exchanges can reduce renewable integration costs and offer efficient price signals. A Deloitte study highlights that market-based RE projects can achieve higher internal rates of return (IRR) compared to Power Purchase Agreement (PPA)-based projects. This approach addresses issues like signing delays, timely payments, and avoiding disputes.The Ministry of Power’s report on the ""Development of Electricity Market in India"" also advocates for a larger role for power exchanges, citing the inefficiencies of long-term PPAs. The report suggests models such as Contracts for Difference (CfD) and Virtual PPAs, which have been successful in countries like the UK and Germany.The future of renewable energy integration hinges on grid-level energy storage. Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) are poised to drive sector growth, offering cost-effective 24/7 renewable power. Recent tenders have shown significant tariff reductions, making BESS a promising solution for rapid decarbonization.The establishment of a Capacity Market is a key anticipated change, aimed at bridging power generation with national demand and determining optimal energy mixes. Additionally, the government's push for Green Hydrogen and Rooftop Solar projects is setting the stage for Peer-to-Peer (P2P) trading, which will revolutionize power consumption in India.Power exchanges have consistently delivered lower prices compared to other procurement methods over the past 15 years. As India advances towards energy banking solutions, energy storage, and green hydrogen, new products on power exchanges will be crucial in meeting the country's future energy demands. The Union Budget 2024 presents a pivotal opportunity to harness the potential of power exchanges, driving India towards a sustainable and efficient energy future.",Power exchanges offer over 25 contracts across various market segments and trading more than 120 billion units (BUs) annually. Power exchanges account for only about 7% of the country's total power generation.

Budget 2024 expectations : As India strives to attain developed nation status, the healthcare sector stands as a crucial component, underpinning the nation's aims for inclusive growth, sustainable development, and a bright future for its citizens. Over the past decade, India has made notable progress in healthcare, with significant advancements in infrastructure, technology, and accessibility.While the government has undertaken numerous vital reforms for the healthcare sector, the industry stakeholders have high expectations from the new government on the healthcare needs of the nation, especially regarding public health spending , which is anticipated to increase to 2.5% of GDP by 2025, aligning with the National Health Policy 2017 . To enhance healthcare infrastructure, there's a need to realign financing schemes to meet sector needs, ensuring a minimum lending period of 10 years. This should cover medical colleges and their academic and hospital wings, including nursing and allied healthcare.Standardization in clinical practice through robust implementation of Standard Treatment Guidelines across all states is essential. For tackling NCDs like Cancer, a nodal agency should be set up for cancer care that will consolidate and simplify various programs and regulations currently under various departments and include innovative screening technologies (AI/non-AI) for early detection of diseases in the national program guidelines.We need to strengthen Ayushman Bharat - Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB-PMJAY) and expand the limit to 10 lakhs for all covered population and 15 lakh for specific diseases like organ transplant, oncology treatment etc. Additionally, a scientific costing study for various treatments under AB-PMJAY is necessary to determine sustainable reimbursement rates, encouraging private healthcare providers to participate and help expand the scheme to senior citizens (70 years & above), as announced by the government, and the underserved. Viable package rates are crucial so that existing secondary and tertiary care private hospitals join the scheme and newer hospitals can be built to meet the increased number of patients who would avail the scheme.Augmenting and strengthening the healthcare workforce is also critical for the Indian healthcare sector. An 'Empowered Group on National Healthcare Workforce' should be established, providing a multi-stakeholder platform to develop a comprehensive strategy for workforce development. A national-level registry for all types of healthcare workers that will serve as a tool to help Central and state governments’ plan for upskilling and interventions for equitable distribution of the workforce can be created. We also need to construct an epidemiologic ‘needs-based’ model for healthcare workforce planning that considers the health needs of the population, disease burden, population growth, healthcare delivery infrastructure, and other critical parameters. Such a model could use demographic population projections to estimate the number of nurses and physicians required to provide this core set of services in 2047.For ease of doing business, we need to reduce the compliance burden by establishing a Single Window Clearance System for the health services sector for investors and companies. Currently 55+ licenses are required, with multiple portals in different states asking for similar data requirements along with multiple application and payment processes. There are 179 Laws, Regulations, Rules and Guidelines applicable to healthcare organisations. Implementation of the Clinical Establishment Act should be uniform for all states.Further, it is important to allow hospitals and healthcare facilities to avail input tax credit (ITC), under the GST regime, so that the credit chain is enabled for the health services sector. Currently the healthcare facilities are unable to avail ITC leading to higher cost of services to patients.","The healthcare sector stands as a crucial component, underpinning the nation's aims for inclusive growth, sustainable development, and a bright future for its citizens.

Government should cut public sector bank stake: SBI economists,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/government-should-cut-public-sector-bank-stake-sbi-economists/articleshow/111587311.cms,"MUMBAI: A fortnight ahead of the Union Budget , a research report released by the country's largest public sector bank has proposed that govt pare its stake in public sector banks given the positive impact of their 'good financial health' on valuations. The report also called for consolidation in the number of PSU banks.While a recommendation for govt to divest stake in PSU banks is a standard suggestion from management consultancy firms or industry associations, it is considered a radical recommendation for PSU report.In a report containing pre-Budget recommendations, SBI Economics Department, headed by group chief economic adviser Soumya Kanti Ghosh, has suggested multiple reforms for PSU banks, including reduction of ownership stake, HR autonomy, investments in digital & IT infrastructure and aligning the priority sector framework to the nation's priorities. ""As banks are in good condition, govt should take stance on disinvestment of PSBs,"" the report said.The report also calls for clarification on govt on the stake divestment in IDBI Bank. ""Govt and LIC are selling an almost 61% stake in IDBI Bank. They invited bids from buyers in Oct 2022. In Jan 2023, DIPAM received several expressions of interest for the IDBI Bank stake on offer. We expect govt to clarify this in the Budget,"" the report said. The report also calls for bank fixed deposits achieving tax parity with other asset classes.""The present dispensation for equity/mutual fund holdings stipulates a short-term capital gains tax at a flat rate of 15%, while long-term capital gains are taxed at a moderate 10%, with an exemption allowed for income of LTCG up to Rs 1 lakh during a fiscal year. Additionally, the setting-off of losses against profits and carrying over the loss for up to the next eight years makes the opportunity cost of such alternative investments quite lucrative,"" the report said. It added that govt should tweak the tax on deposit interest and implement a flat tax treatment across the maturity ladder.The report comes at a time when the IDBI Bank sale process is stuck because of RBI not granting 'fit and proper' recognition to any bidder. Govt has not managed to sell IDBI Bank despite the lender being re-classified as a private bank in March 2019.","SBI Economics Department, headed by group chief economic adviser Soumya Kanti Ghosh, has suggested multiple reforms for PSU banks.

Budget 2024 expectations : With an aim to enhance healthcare accessibility, the Modi government is actively pursuing plans to double the reach of its flagship Ayushman Bharat health insurance scheme over the next three years.According to a PTI report, discussions are intensifying to increase the annual insurance coverage under the Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB-PMJAY) from the current Rs 5 lakh to Rs 10 lakh per family - a step that may be announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman in the Union Budget 2024 .The expansion of AB-PMJAY would likely begin by covering all individuals aged 70 years and above, potentially extending comprehensive health coverage to more than two-thirds of India's population. This expansion is expected to add approximately 4 to 5 crore new beneficiaries to the program, significantly enhancing healthcare access for senior citizens across the country.This enhancement is crucial to alleviate financial burdens associated with costly medical treatments like organ transplants and cancer therapies, addressing a critical factor contributing to family indebtedness due to healthcare expenses.Also Read | Budget 2024 income tax expectations: Top 10 things FM Sitharaman should do for salaried taxpayers According to estimates by the National Health Authority, implementing these proposals would necessitate an additional annual expenditure of Rs 12,076 crore for the exchequer.

"US inflation broadly cools, likely sealing deal for fed rate cut",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-inflation-broadly-cools-likely-sealing-deal-for-fed-rate-cut/articleshow/111667320.cms,"US inflation cooled broadly in June to the slowest pace since 2021 on the back of a long-awaited slowdown in housing costs , sending the strongest signal yet that the Federal Reserve can cut interest rates soon.The so-called core consumer price index — which excludes food and energy costs — climbed 0.1% from May, the smallest advance in three years, Bureau of Labor Statistics figures showed Thursday.The overall measure fell for the first time since the onset of the pandemic, dragged down by cheaper gasoline.Similar to the May CPI report — which Fed Chair Jerome Powell described this week as “really good” following an unexpected flare-up in the first quarter — the June reading will go a long way toward giving Powell and his colleagues the confidence they need to cut rates, likely starting in September. Policymakers will have a chance to signal such a move may be coming when they meet later in July, especially since unemployment has now risen for three straight months.Powell, in testimony before lawmakers this week, avoided signaling the timing of likely rate cuts and insisted policy moves would be guided by incoming data. The Fed chief is set to speak again Monday afternoon in a moderated discussion hosted by the Economic Club of Washington, DC.“We are sufficiently confident — even if the Fed is not yet ready to admit they are — that inflation is on the way back to the 2% target,” Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM US LLP, said in a note. “The road is now open to a rate cut by the Federal Reserve in September.”After the CPI report, Treasuries rallied and traders all but fully priced in September and December rate cuts. They also marked up the odds of a reduction in November to better than even — a move that would come right after the presidential election. Before Thursday, traders and policymakers were divided as to whether there would be just one or two cuts this year.The report also offered encouraging news for President Joe Biden as he prepares for a high-stakes press conference later Thursday amid calls from fellow Democrats for him to step aside as the party’s nominee. The embattled president cheered the data in a statement, saying it shows “significant progress” in the fight against inflation.Metric Actual EstimateCPI MoM -0.1% +0.1%Core CPI MoM +0.1% +0.2%CPI YoY +3.0% +3.1%Core CPI YoY +3.3% +3.4%Shelter prices, which is the largest category within services, climbed 0.2%, the smallest gain since August 2021. Owners’ equivalent rent — a subset of shelter, which is the biggest individual component of the CPI — climbed 0.3%, also the tamest in three years.“Probably the most significant aspect of the June report is the downshift in housing inflation,” said Julia Coronado, the founder of MacroPolicy Perspectives LLC and former Fed economist. “It looks broad-based and durable, and numerous Fed officials have indicated a downshift would boost their confidence that inflation is indeed returning to 2% in a sustainable way.”In addition to slower rent increases, the costs of other services like airfares, hotel stays and inpatient hospital care all declined from a month earlier. New and used vehicle prices led broader decreases in the core goods basket.The BLS noted that the new vehicles index was estimated with fewer prices than in previous months due to a cyberattack that hit thousands of dealerships in June, but software systems have since been restored. “BLS has no further information on when typical data flows will resume and is monitoring the situation closely,” according to the report.Separate figures Thursday showed recurring applications for jobless benefits held near the highest level since late 2021. At the same time, first-time filings fell by 17,000 last week — matching the largest drop in a year — providing some optimism that the job market is holding up.This is a modal window.The media could not be loaded, either because the server or network failed or because the format is not supported.Excluding housing and energy, services prices fell for a second month, according to Bloomberg calculations. While central bankers have stressed the importance of looking at such a metric when assessing the nation’s inflation trajectory, they compute it based on a separate index.That measure, known as the personal consumption expenditures price index, doesn’t put as much weight on shelter as the CPI does. That helps explain why the PCE gauge has been trending closer to the Fed’s 2% target.The PCE measure, released later this month, draws from the CPI as well as certain categories within the producer price index, which is due Friday.The latest results from Delta Air Lines Inc. suggest more scope for services inflation to cool. The carrier’s revenue projections came in weaker than forecast as competition in the domestic market drives ticket prices lower.Meanwhile, a sustained decline in the price of goods over most of the past year has largely been providing some relief to consumers. So-called core goods prices, which exclude food and energy commodities, fell in June for a fourth month.Prices of new vehicles declined for a sixth month, and several apparel categories dropped as well. The cost of household furnishings has fallen nearly every month for the past year.There are also signs that consumers are growing increasingly sensitive to higher prices. Earlier on Thursday, PepsiCo Inc. reported weaker-than-expected revenue growth as budget-focused shoppers weighed on the volume of goods sold. The salty snacks category has been particularly lackluster.A separate report Thursday, combining the inflation data with figures on wages published last week, showed real earnings growth has been positive for the past year.","US inflation cooled broadly in June to the slowest pace since 2021. The slowdown in housing costs is the strongest signal yet that the Federal Reserve can cut interest rates soon. The overall measure fell for the first time since the onset of the pandemic, dragged down by cheaper gasoline.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111667205,imgsize-70150,width-400,resizemode-4/111667205.jpg"

Honeywell International Inc agreed to buy Air Products and Chemicals Inc’s liquefied natural gas process technology and equipment business for $1.81 billion in cash.

A rally in the world’s largest technology companies sent stocks to all-time highs, with Jerome Powell ’s remarks to Congress not doing much to dissuade traders from betting on Federal Reserve rate cuts this year.For the first time in its history, the S&P 500 topped 5,600. A renewed bid for megacaps drove the US equity benchmark to its longest rally since November, with Nvidia Corp.up over 2.5% and Apple Inc. climbing on news it aims to ship 10% more new iPhones after a bumpy 2023. Treasuries remained fairly stable after a strong $39 billion sale of 10-year bonds. Swaps are pricing in two Fed cuts in 2024 — and higher chances the first comes in September.As Wall Street geared up for the consumer-price index, Powell said the Fed doesn’t need inflation below 2% before cutting rates, while adding officials still have more work to do. He noted the labor market has cooled “pretty significantly.” Powell cited a “good ways to go” on the balance-sheet runoff, and said commercial real estate doesn’t threaten financial stability.“The key takeaway from his testimony is the Fed’s assessment of the balance of risks is shifting in ways that – if supported and sustained by incoming data – will deliver a rate cut in September,” said Krishna Guha at Evercore.The S&P 500 climbed 1% — up for a seventh straight day — to notch its 37th record this year. Gold and silver mining stocks rallied on Fed easing bets. Banks underperformed. Google parent Alphabet Inc. has shelved efforts to acquire HubSpot Inc., according to people with knowledge of the matter.US 10-year yields fell two basis points to 4.28%. Bank of England Chief Economist Huw Pill said the timing of a rate cut is still an “open question,” prompting traders to pare bets on August cut. Oil rose as a US holiday boosted demand for gasoline and jet fuel.S&P 500 Sees Longest Winning Streak Since November“Markets remain remarkably calm despite the flood of data this week, including Fed Chair Powell’s testimony, CPI/PPI reports, and the beginning of earnings season,” said Mark Hackett at Nationwide.The so-called core CPI, which excludes food and energy costs and is seen as a better measure of underlying inflation, is expected to rise 0.2% in June for a second month. That would mark the smallest back-to-back gains since August — a pace more palatable for Fed officials.“June’s CPI report looks to be another ‘very good’ report that should boost the FOMC’s confidence about the inflation trajectory,” said Anna Wong at Bloomberg Economics. “That should set the stage for the Fed to start cutting rates in September.”A survey conducted by 22V Research shows 55% of investors expect the market reaction Thursday’s CPI to be “risk-on,” 16% said “risk-off” and 29% “mixed/negligible.”“There is optimism about inflation generally,” said Dennis DeBusschere at 22V, adding that the survey also showed investors think “CPI is on a Fed-friendly glide path.”Meantime, some trading desks say investors should gear up for a potential break in the eerie calm that’s recently descended on the market.The options market is betting the S&P 500 Index will move 0.8% in either direction after Thursday’s report on consumer prices, based on the price of that day’s at-the-money straddles, according to Stuart Kaiser, Citigroup’s head of US equity trading strategy.If it happens, that would be the biggest move for the index since June 12, the day of the last CPI print and interest-rate decision.Market volatility may pick up in the days and weeks ahead, amid US political uncertainty, comments from the Fed chair, and the start of the second-quarter earnings season, according to Mark Haefele at UBS Global Wealth Management.Source: Citi Global MarketsFor the first time since 2022, S&P 500 earnings may not be laser-focused on just technology, with the quarter’s success hanging on everything aside from the megacap tech heavyweights that have driven stocks to all-time highs, according to Bloomberg Intelligence strategists led by Gina Martin Adams.“While forecasts for the ‘Magnificent Seven’ remain robust, their earnings are expected to slow in the second quarter — just as the rest of the S&P 500 may finally post their first year-on-year growth in at least five quarters,” they noted.The Magnificent Seven may have already peaked, while the remaining S&P 500 stocks may post their first earnings expansion in at least six quarters, the strategists concluded.","S&P 500 Sees Longest Winning Streak Since November.

The retreat's agenda

This week marks the beginning of the “annual fly-in event” at Friedman Memorial Airport in Hailey, Idaho, colloquially known as the “summer camp for billionaires .” Hosted by the New York investment bank Allen & Company, the exclusive Sun Valley retreat attracts some of the richest and most powerful leaders in business, media, and politics.As per a CNN report, the gathering, scheduled from July 9-13, brings together high-profile guests in a relaxed, trail-dad chic atmosphere.Participants, clad in puffy Patagonia vests and Apple watches, engage in off-the-record discussions and enjoy organized adventures such as hiking and rafting.Sun Valley has a reputation for being the birthplace of significant business deals. It is widely believed that Jeff Bezos decided to buy The Washington Post at this retreat, and Comcast's acquisition of NBC Universal was also reportedly conceived here. Warren Buffett famously referred to Sun Valley dealmaking as “acquisitions by walking around.”The Idaho Mountain Express and Variety have reported a parade of private jets arriving on Tuesday, July 9, carrying dozens of power brokers including:Other prominent names from the tech and business sector expected to attend are Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Andy Jassy, Peter Thiel, Daniel Ek, Neal Mohan, Michael J Cavanagh, Dara Khosrowshahi, Brian Chesky, Mike Fries, Barry Diller, Alex Karp, Ynon Kreiz, and Marc Benioff.From the entertainment and fashion world, notable attendees include Shari Redstone, Jason Blum, Brian Grazer, Bobby Kotick, Charles Rivkin, Bryan Lourd, François-Henri Pinault, Sara Blakely, Michael Rapino, Anthony Wood, and Netflix co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters.Political figures expected to attend include Michael Bloomberg, Chuck Schumer, Amos Yadlin, Kyrsten Sinema, Wes Moore, Brad Little, Mark Gordon, Gretchen Whitmer, and Josh Shapiro.Media representatives attending are Gayle King, David Begnaud, Anderson Cooper, Erin Burnett, Elle Duncan, Becky Quick, Tom Friedman, Andrew Ross Sorkin, and Evan Osnos.The retreat's agenda is kept secret, and attendees engage in closed-door lectures on topics ranging from national security to healthcare. Despite the secrecy, there is anticipation of discussions around artificial intelligence, Bob Iger’s succession plan, and the Paramount-Skydance merger.One notable absence this year is Warren Buffett, who at nearly 94, is possibly handing over the reins to his successor, Greg Abel. Elon Musk is also absent, following last year's public fallout with other CEOs.As the elite gather to discuss the future, questions about President Joe Biden’s ability to campaign loom large, with potential 2024 ballot replacements being a hot topic. Governors Gretchen Whitmer, Josh Shapiro, and Wes Moore are seen as potential contenders.","This week marks the beginning of the “annual fly-in event” at Friedman Memorial Airport in Hailey, Idaho.

Jerome Powell: More good inflation data would boost Fed confidence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/jerome-powell-more-good-inflation-data-would-boost-fed-confidence/articleshow/111612325.cms,"Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said “more good data” would strengthen confidence that inflation is moving down toward the US central bank’s 2% target, and recent readings point to “modest further progress” on prices.In testimony prepared for a Senate hearing Tuesday, Powell warned that lowering interest rates too little or too late could put the economy and the labor market at risk.“Elevated inflation is not the only risk we face,” he told lawmakers on the first of two days of congressional testimony. “Reducing policy restraint too late or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment.”The Fed chair also said cutting rates too soon or too much could stall or reverse inflation progress.“More good data would strengthen our confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2%,” Powell told the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs in prepared remarks. He testifies Wednesday before the House Financial Services Committee.US central bankers are aiming to bring inflation back to the 2% goal following a post-pandemic surge in prices. While the labor market has held up under pressure from higher interest rates, an uptick in the unemployment rate has added political pressure on Fed officials to start reducing borrowing costs.Powell’s remarks suggest the Federal Open Market Committee is unlikely to reduce rates when it meets at the end of this month.Treasury yields oscillated but were higher on the day and the S&P 500 index remained higher after Powell’s testimony was released.Traders are pricing in a just over 70% probability that the Fed first cuts rates in September. They see two quarter-point rate reductions in 2024.Fed officials have welcomed recent data indicating inflation is decelerating again following a jump in prices at the start of the year, though several other policymakers have also said they need more confidence that the trend will continue before reducing borrowing costs.The Fed’s preferred inflation measure rose 2.6% in the 12 months through May, down from 7.1% in June 2022. While unemployment remains low at 4.1%, it has ticked up in each of the last three months.A number of economists are warning that there’s a slowdown afoot in the job market that could worsen. The number of people who have been looking for a job for 15 weeks or more rose in June to the highest level since early 2022, when that measure was rapidly declining.Powell called the labor market “strong, but not overheated,” adding that the central bank’s restrictive stance is working to bring supply and demand into better balance.“Another increase in the jobless rate in the July report could challenge our base case of one rate cut this year in December, raising the possibility of two cuts starting in September,” said Yelena Shulyatyeva, senior economist at BNP Paribas.The Fed has held its policy rate at what it describes as a restrictive level of 5.25% to 5.5% for a year. Futures traders have almost fully priced in a cut for the Sept 17-18 policy meeting, less than two months before the US election.","Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell testifies before a Senate committee.

It would also be subject to a period of court-supervised probation.The Justice Department determined in May that Boeing breached a 2021 deferred-prosecution agreement tied to the crashes that was struck in the waning days of the Trump Administration.

SEATTLE: “IT’S TIME TO EARN IT BACK!!!” Reads the last line (in screaming all capital letters) of a notice board at Boeing ’s Renton final assembly line (FLA) in Seattle where the ill-famed MAX version of the once best-selling B737s are rolled out. It reminds technicians at work here that “737 conformance rate for multiple (assembly) processes have dropped below confidence level” and that the goal is to “ensure a conforming product (for) our customers.”Following two deadly crashes that left 346 people dead; subsequent global grounding for 21 months and a mid-air door blowout involving the MAX in last six years, the 108-year-old aerospace major is battling the biggest crisis of its lifetime — including potential criminal charges by the US justice department.The old slogan “if it’s not Boeing, I am not going,” is a distant memory at least for now.Amid belated enhanced oversight by America’s Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) as a consequence of the MAX mishaps, Boeing is trying hard to win the trust back. It recently opened the doors of its single (737) and twin (777) aisle FLAs in Seattle to a section of the world’s media, including TOI. The senior management there admitted of lapses in recent years, while assuring corrective steps are being taken. Process heads spoke of bringing back checks & balances that had been done away with, in pursuit of churning out planes quickly.Clearly, there’s a lot of work to be done to regain the confidence. Multiple aerospace industry insiders in the US who worked for or with Boeing said the focus in last few years had shifted from engineering excellence to financial performance. “I used to be with a supply chain partner and we were constantly asked to cut corners to reduce cost of our supplies. Beyond a point, it became difficult to work with Boeing,” said an engineer in San Francisco who did not want to be named.The final straw proved to be the most recent MAX scare — Jan 5, 2024, door plug blowout on an Alaska Air B737-9 MAX in the US. Elizabeth Lund, Boeing’s senior VP (quality) says the company’s first reaction “was to take immediate action to ensure that no airplane ever leads our factory that could cause an accident. I will tell you very transparently.”She gave an exhaustive list of steps taken to spruce up safety, including something as basic as spelling out the task required in simple English; end of line inspection for critical systems; ensuring work not completed in a process does not travel to the next stage of FLA; enhanced workforce training; eliminating defects and 100% following of safety and quality management systems.“We knew we needed to address systemic issues. The first is workforce experience. We have brought in so many employees since Covid and it overlapped with the time of the MAX grounding (March 2019-Dec 2020). We didn’t actually do an involuntary layoff but we didn’t get them (many of those who left) back. When we came out of the MAX grounding, we were back flying again. We were coming out of Covid and the market came back, incredibly fast at that point. We were hiring lots and lots of people in a short period of time (many) with less experience. (And in) many cases, no aerospace experience. Our build plans are at times complicated. Particularly for a new employee with no aerospace experience. Perhaps they speak English as a second language, (making things) even more complicated,” she said.Elizabeth Lund (Image credit: Saurabh Sinha)Boeing then started using artificial intelligence to go from “engineering English” to “more clear” English. So Instead of saying Boeing wants a 0.375 (unit of measure) hole plus or minus 0.05, it now says the hole should be between 0.356 and 0.393. Many newcomers were found to be “struggling to do jobs correctly”. So Boeing says it overhauled its foundational training and linked it to proficiency testing.A key challenge for the leadership is to keep the workforce morale high as it tries to the with the world’s confidence in its planes. “We are humans and are affected by what has unfortunately happened in the recent past,” said a technician at the MAX assembly line. Katie Ringgold, VP of the 737 programme and Renton site leader, had one request for the media during the shop floor visit, “Keep the tough questions for me and the leadership (and not pose them to the technicians there).”Jason Clark, VP & GM of the B777 programme and Everett site leader, said “employee involvement (EI) — where workers discuss production issues regularly — has been brought back over a month back. “It was done away with as there was a lot of overlap. By doing so, we lost the voice of the mechanic. Now we have again created groups for mechanics to discuss and fix problems,” Clark said.The increased focus on safety and checks has meant FAA asked Boeing to churn out a lot fewer that the 38 allowed B737 MAX per month. Customer airlines, including Air India Express and Akasa, don’t know what will be the delivery schedule of their ordered MAX. The popular Dreamliner (B787) production, assembled at a FLA in Charleston in South Carolina, is also hit. “The production programme in Charleston has been slowed down to stability due to supply chain issues. The steadfast focus is on fey and processes. We will up the rate in next few years and return to five 787s per month later in 2024,” said Scott Stocker, VP & GM B787 programme and South Carolina site leader.Following the Indonesian Lion Air B737 MAX crash in October 2018; Ethiopian B737 MAX crash in March 2019, these planes were grounded globally. They were allowed to resume flying in Dec 2020 after Boeing assured all required corrective action has been taken. Then the door plug blowout happened this Jan on a US carrier.Asked why should anyone believe Boeing that it is actually all that is required to make safe planes, Lund admitted she gets that question as lot. “After the Max crashes we took (many) positive steps. We (created) a separate organisation focused on safety. Just a couple of days (later) I took over this position. There were various levels of internal audit for our production system focused on quality…. We are a company deeply committed to flying safety; to public safety and to our employees. I believe (the current) plan will make us stronger. We are transparent with you (media), with our regulators and our customers. We have opened our factories up to our customers so that they can come in. The regulator has access to all of our data. There is no hidden agenda. There is no hidden data. We are a transparent company who deeply cares about safety and the public and our employees and we are committed to be better every day,” Lund tried to reassure.“We have for years dedicated to making air transportation as safe as humanly possible and continue that way. I believe that the actions we have taken for many years have allowed air transportation to be the safest means of transportation. We have taken steps to address (safety issues) and continue to do so,” she said.Boeing says it has used the Alaska Air door plug-out to “to step back, holistically look at everything and be very introspective. To see what else could we do? How can we be certain that our system is as absolutely robust as possible. So we started collecting input from many many sources.” Boeing received over 30,000 ideas, pain points and areas for improvement across the board, apart from directives of FAA auditors, which are the “primary foundation” of the make-planes-safe-again plan.“How we make sure we make the perfect airplane? The first is invest in workforce training. The second is simplify plans and processes. The third eliminate defects both coming in and that we create and the fourth, elevate our safety and quality,” Lund said.“A defect, non-conforming rivets, arrived from our supplier which in themselves did not create a safety hazard but needed to be fixed. The airplane then traveled throughout the factory. It moved to the end of the (FLA) line while we discussed with our supplier back and forth. By the time we all reached agreement that the rivets needed to be removed and replaced, we had a non-compliance to our process,” Lund said.That plug was opened “without correct documentation and paperwork”. Boeing has a “loop crew” who just button the airplane up for weather when it rolls out of the factory. “In this case, they closed the plug. They did not reinstall the retaining pins. That is not their job. Their job is to just close it and they count on existing paperwork…. The last step is what we call an okay to close. The the plug had a little bit of a fit. That’s how it was able to fly for roughly 150 cycles (before the blowout happened)… A defect entered our system from our supply chain which travelled throughout our final assembly. And then there was a lack of compliance to our processes,” Lund added.Speaking about this under investigation case has earned Boeing the ire of US regulatory agencies.The reporter was in Seattle at the invitation of Boeing.","Boeing is battling the biggest crisis of its lifetime — including potential criminal charges by the US justice department. Senior management there admitted of lapses in recent years, while assuring corrective steps are being taken. Process heads spoke of bringing back checks & balances that had been done away with in pursuit of churning out planes quickly.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111555685,imgsize-2028995,width-400,resizemode-4/111555685.jpg"

However, Russia's ongoing conflict with Ukraine has raised hopes for more concerted efforts in this direction. Germany, for instance, is currently considering partnering with Carlyle, a private equity firm, to jointly acquire a majority stake in Thyssenkrupp's submarines and frigates division.The alliance between Rheinmetall and Leonardo aligns with the broader objective of both groups to create pan-European consortia for the development of new combat systems.Cingolani stated, ""The target is to create a machine that is cutting-edge for the future. A machine that is cross-domain and interoperable, talking, in the future, to satellites, helicopters and aircraft.""On Wednesday, the companies announced that they have agreed to form a joint venture to produce tanks and other land defence systems, reported Reuters.The first goal of the 50-50 enterprise, which will be headquartered in Italy, will be to develop the Italian Main Battle Tank and Armoured Infantry Combat System for the Italian Army, they said in a joint statement.",Germany's Rheinmetall and Italy's Leonardo have formed a joint venture to consolidate the European defence vehicle sector.

"EU imposes duties on China-built EVs, leaving four months for talks",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/eu-imposes-duties-on-china-built-evs-leaving-four-months-for-talks/articleshow/111484993.cms,"BRUSSELS: The European Union will impose tariffs of up to 37.6% from Friday on imports of electric vehicles made in China, EU officials said on Thursday, ratcheting up trade tension with Beijing.There is however a four-month window during which the tariffs are only provisional and intensive talks are expected to continue between the two sides.The European Commission 's provisional duties of between 17.4% and 37.6% without backdating are designed to prevent what its president Ursula von der Leyen has said is a threatened flood of cheap EVs built state subsidies.The rates are almost exactly the same as those announced by the Commission on June 12. The executive made slight adjustments after companies identified minor calculation errors in the initial disclosure.Beijing said then it would take ""all necessary measures"" to safeguard China's interests.These could include retaliatory tariffs on exports to China of products such as cognac or pork.The EU anti-subsidy investigation has nearly four more months to run.At the end of it, the Commission, the EU's executive arm, could propose ""definite duties"", typically applying for five years, on which EU members would vote.China's commerce ministry said on Thursday both sides have so far held several rounds of technical talks over tariffs on the issue.""There is still a four-month window before arbitration, and we hope that the European and Chinese sides will move in the same direction, show sincerity, and push forward with the consultation process as soon as possible,"" He Yadong, a ministry spokesperson, said.BYD will face duties of 17.4%, Geely 19.9% and SAIC 37.6%, the EU said on Thursday. These are on top of the EU's standard 10% duty on car imports.Companies deemed by the EU to have cooperated with the anti-subsidy investigation, including western carmakers Tesla and BMW, will be subject to 20.8% tariffs and those that did not cooperate a rate of 37.6%.The Commission has estimated Chinese brands' share of the EU market has risen to 8% from below 1% in 2019 and could reach 15% in 2025. It says prices are typically 20% below those of EU-made models.European policymakers are keen to avoid a repeat of what happened with solar panels a decade ago, when the EU took only limited action to curb Chinese imports and many European manufacturers collapsed. The EU launched its anti-subsidy investigation into Chinese EVs last October.The Chinese Passenger Car Association has said the tariffs will have only a modest impact on the majority of Chinese firms.The rates are far lower than the 100% tariff Washington plans to apply to Chinese EV imports from August.",The European Commission's provisional duties of between 17.4% and 37.6% without backdating are designed to prevent what its president Ursula von der Leyen has said is a threatened flood of cheap EVs built state subsidies.
