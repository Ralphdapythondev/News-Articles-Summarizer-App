Reducing China dependence: Tata developing complex high-precision machines to make Apple iPhone casing; aims for exports,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/reducing-china-dependence-tata-developing-complex-high-precision-machines-to-make-apple-iphone-casing-aims-for-exports/articleshow/109615098.cms,"Tata Group plans

Tata Electronics , a significant player in assembling enclosures for Apple iPhones in India, is now working on developing sophisticated and complex high-precision machines used to produce iPhone casings, according to sources who spoke to ET. The company has partnered with two Indian manufacturers to develop these capabilities and plans to export these complex machines in the future, moving away from importing them from China.These machines can be utilized in the production lines of contract manufacturers working for global companies like Apple.This move is expected to provide a crucial impetus to the government's target of $300 billion in electronics exports by 2025.A person familiar with the developments told the financial daily, ""The Tata Group is testing these machines in a staged manner at their Hosur facility."" The objective is to grow more of its local capability, as the company aims to develop the ecosystem in the country, rather than just building enclosures. These machines are one of the many inputs that go into making a component or an enclosure, and the company is looking to reduce its exclusive dependence on certain parts.Experts believe that this development could be a significant boost to the Indian manufacturing story, as it showcases the country's ability to produce complex machinery and reduce reliance on imports.Ajai Chowdhry, the co-founder of HCL, emphasized the high demand for casings in the electronics industry. He stated, ""Everybody wants casings. If Tata Group is able to do import substitution and they're able to make these machines in India, it will create an industry because so many people want casings. Anybody who wants to make a phone or a tablet in India needs casings and if they're able to adhere to Apple's stringent standards, it would be a high-quality machine in itself.""According to a source, Indian manufacturers possess varying levels of capability and readiness to implement the plan. This initiative is part of the company's global strategy to decrease reliance on specific low-tech components before transitioning to more intricate parts. The objective is to diversify and mitigate risks associated with global supply chain disruptions while simultaneously fostering the manufacturing ecosystem within the country.Also Read | 5 lakh ‘Apployments’: Apple ecosystem to create huge number of jobs in 3 years; iPhone maker may move half its supply chain from China to India The source mentioned that although Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machines are widely used across various sectors in India, domestic manufacturers currently lack the capability to utilize CNC machines for precision components.The person stated that diversifying and de-risking the supply chain is a priority for all stakeholders, including the government, manufacturers like the Tata Group, and the companies themselves. An official disclosed that the Tata Group operates approximately 40 lines at their facility in Hosur.The Tata Group has formed partnerships with two companies, one located in Pune and the other in Bengaluru, an official said.Although the Tata Group has intentions to export, it may require some time before this plan becomes a reality on the ground, according to one of the sources.Also Read | Apple Awas Yojana?

A lot of machines from India do go overseas, but this one again is about precision stuff, which is so complicated, so it's a maturity curve that will take time.""Pankaj Mohindroo, the chairman of the industry body India Cellular & Electronics Association (ICEA), emphasized the significance of developing key capital goods for the industry. He stated, ""We are working on developing India as a major assembling and components hub for electronics' capital goods.""","Tata Electronics is a significant player in assembling enclosures for Apple iPhones in India.

Why business curbs are new weapon in RBI armoury,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-business-curbs-are-new-weapon-in-rbi-armoury/articleshow/109607898.cms,"MUMBAI: For big banks , a penalty slapped by RBI for violations had as much impact as a traffic violation fine for a BMW owner. The fine did not impact senior management compensation, the share price did not budge and the penalty was a rounding sum in the bank's balance sheet.In the past, in addition to penalties, at best, RBI tried to tighten the screws by either compounding the offences (fining multiple instances of the same offence) or by holding back on permissions for new activities.But this was a stick that the central bank could not use with all. For instance, card networks had little direct role to play in India.RBI had a bigger challenge in dealing with multinationals in getting them to comply particularly when their operations were limited. This was experienced when RBI introduced norms for local data storage of payment system. After waiting for two years, in April 2021, RBI for the first time used business restrictions as enforcement action barring Mastercard and Diners Club from onboarding new customers until they complied with the norms. On its part, RBI has argued that none of its actions has come without giving the entities time to fix the problems.RBI's actions on business restriction have intensified in the last two years with institutions that were considered ""too big to fail"" facing the restrictions as well. ""In banking circles, the fear these days is whose turn is going to be the next...I mean, the actions in the past six months has been relentless by RBI...It started with HDFC Bank three years ago, Bajaj Auto Finance, Paytm (Payments Bank), IIFL (Finance) and a whole lot of fines imposed on so many banks and NBFCs,"" said Suresh Ganapathy research analyst with Macquarie in a note.According to him, no one would have expected an entity like Kotak Mahindra, which entered the market with techonology as its USP and the affluent middle class as its focus, to face the regulatory ire.Incidentally, most of the compliance issues raised by RBI, whether it is HDFC Bank, Kotak Bank or Bank of Baroda, are technology-related and involve not putting required safety systems in place. Bankers said the reluctance to fix systems is not just because of finances but because management does not want to disturb a ""running engine"". Systems that were cutting edge 20 years ago are now creaking legacy systems and many banks need a strong nudge to fix things they feel are not broken.The other tool that RBI has used to get banks to toe the regulatory line is CEO extensions. According to Ganapathy, RBI has also made it difficult to second guess the regulator on CEO extensions , which also matter a lot when it comes to stock performance.According to an executive with a credit rating agency, RBI has been successful in imposing business restrictions while other regulators have not used is because of the powers it enjoys. ""These powers are required given that in the digital age a bank run can will be difficult to stall."" RBI can not only stop a bank from doing business, it can also change the management and board of a bank. ""Unlike Sebi which has found many of its orders overturned by the Securities Appellate Tribunal, the RBI order are not subject to external review,"" he added.RBI's business restrictions hurts regulated entities in two ways. First, it impacts the entity's top line by reducing business. More importantly, the business restrictions almost immediately result in a fall in valuation which can run into thousands of crores and increase shareholder pressure on the management. ""We believe such restrictions should impact business growth, including KMB's,"" Emkay Finance said in a report.","RBI's actions on business restriction have intensified in the last two years with institutions that were considered ""too big to fail"" facing the restrictions.

"No more OTP frauds? Home Ministry teams up with SBI Cards, telecom operators for innovative solution on stolen one-time passwords",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/no-more-otp-frauds-home-ministry-teams-up-with-sbi-cards-telecom-operators-for-innovative-solution-on-stolen-one-time-passwords/articleshow/109524380.cms,"Crooks on the prowl

No more OTP frauds? India's home ministry, SBI Cards and Payment Services Ltd (SBI Card), and telecom operators are collaborating to create a solution that will alert customers about stolen one-time passwords (OTPs) as part of a larger initiative to address the increasing risk of cyber fraud and phishing attacks on the banking system.According to two individuals familiar with the matter, the government is evaluating a solution that will enable banks to monitor a customer's registered address and the geolocation where an OTP is being delivered.If there is a discrepancy between the two locations, the customer can be notified of a potential phishing attempt, said an ET report. The solution is currently in the testing phase, and the goal is to use the telecom database to track the customer's geolocation and ensure that the OTP is being sent to the correct location.The Reserve Bank of India had advocated for an additional factor of authentication for any digital payment transaction primarily to prevent fraud. However, over time, fraudsters have developed sophisticated capabilities to either steal OTPs by deceiving unsuspecting bank customers or redirect OTPs to their own devices through fraudulent means, rendering the second factor of authentication ineffective in combating cybercrime.If there is a problem with the OTP delivery location, two steps can be taken: either an alert can be displayed on the device, or the OTP can be blocked entirely. While the specifics of the solution are still being developed with telecom companies, a customer's SIM location can be verified in real-time and compared to the geolocation of OTP delivery. Banks also have their own data on customers' residences, so capabilities will need to be developed to triangulate the data in real-time.Also Read | Getting wrong calls from loan recovery agents, unable to link number with bank account? You may have got a recycled mobile number “For instance, the customer lives in Bengaluru and the OTP is getting delivered in some place in Uttar Pradesh where the person has never been or from where the person has not made any calls recently, which means he or she is not traveling to that place; this is a typical red flag scenario,” a banker said.According to the Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (i4C), cyber criminals siphoned off as much as Rs 10,319 crore between April 2021 and December 2023. The majority of the crimes originated in China, Cambodia, and Myanmar and involved non-state actors. Under i4C, the government established the 'Citizen Financial Cyber Fraud Reporting and Management System', which has prevented approximately Rs 1,200 crore in fraudulent transfers from more than 470,000 citizen complaints received until February 2024. In the calendar year 2023, the registry received 1.12 million complaints totaling Rs 7,488 crore in fraudulent transfers.","India's home ministry, SBI Cards and Payment Services Ltd (SBI Card), and telecom operators are collaborating to create a solution that will alert customers about stolen one-time passwords.

On the outlook, Batra said, ""We do expect net interest margin to be range-bound adjusted for seasonality unless there is any change in the repo rate as there are imponderables during the year that we are not aware of. Repricing of term deposits will continue into the first quarter. Going ahead, we expect RBI to undertake a shallow rate cut.""""Our deposits have been growing at a healthy rate. We will not be raising deposits at any cost. As a bank, our objective is to meet the overall need of the customer,"" he added.Batra also said that the bank continues to enhance the use of technology in its operations and to provide solutions to customers.

The finance minister set the stage for a ""Viksit Bharat by 2047"", on the core principles of ‘Sabka Saath’, ‘Sabka Vikas’, ‘Sabka Vishwas’, with ‘Sabka Prayas’ being added as a new theme in the interim Budget.This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data i.e., farmer welfare and N for Nari utthan i.e., support for women entrepreneurs.These form the pillars of a comprehensive inclusive development. The Government's commitment to sustainable development under the strategy for Amrit Kaal includes achieving 'Net Zero' by 2070, rooftop solarization for one crore households and robust health initiatives.The Indian economy's resilience takes center stage amidst positive indicators of declining current account deficit as a percentage of GDP, falling unemployment rates, and a notable rise in digital transactions. These statistics affirm the robustness of the economy, showcasing a trajectory of growth and stability.The achievements in taxation reforms are nothing short of remarkable, with direct tax collections more than trebling in the last decade, the number of tax return filers increasing by 2.4 times, average processing time of tax returns plummeting from 93 days in FY 2013-14 to an impressive 10 days in FY 2023-24, resulting in issuance of quick refunds. These are the results of consistent progressive measures thus obviating the need for, and rightly avoiding, any last-minute populist measures.No change in existing tax rates, both for direct and indirect taxes, is a good indicator of stability and predictability for investors and taxpayers.A welcome move to waive outstanding tax demands that are minor, disputed, and unreconciled. This involves the withdrawal of outstanding direct tax demands up to Rs. 25,000 pertaining to the period up to FY 2009-10 and up to Rs.10,000 for FY 2010-11 to 2014-15.The Government's commitment to fostering a business-friendly environment is evident in its intent to extend specific tax benefits for start-ups, investments by sovereign wealth funds/ pension funds, and certain IFSC units. The extension has been made now until March 31, 2025. This might help in creating a conducive landscape for business.To align with the CBDT notification issued earlier, the provisions relating to tax collection at source concerning remittances under the Liberalized Remittance Scheme have now been formally incorporated in the Finance Bill, 2024, setting the rate at 20% for amounts exceeding Rs. 7 lakhs in a financial year.The Finance Bill, 2024 proposes an extension of the time limit for introducing the faceless scheme by the Central Government for transfer pricing proceedings, DRP Proceedings, and ITAT Proceedings, up to March 31, 2025.The interim Budget 2024 may not have proposed significant tax announcements, but it very well positioned the prelude to the full budget post the upcoming elections. Considering the potential impact on the population across the four pillars of GYAN, a sizable portion of India stands to be covered. The interim Budget’s focus on the tax front resembles a report card, highlighting the maturity achieved by our tax system. The enhancement of taxpayer services was emphasized as a key priority.","This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data and N for Nari utthan.

Interim Budget for a Viksit Bharat: It’s for everyone and all,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/interim-budget-for-a-viksit-bharat-its-for-everyone-and-all/articleshow/107497439.cms,"By Akhilesh Tuteja

The Finance Minister on February 01, 2024, delivered a truly innovative interim budget. At first glance, it did not seem like an interim budget but looked more like the budget to drive further growth and a continuum of inclusive growth-oriented investments.At the outset, this budget brings a wonderful balance between fiscal prudence and continued investment for growth.It's not easy to continue the glide path of reducing the fiscal deficit and continuing to make significant investments in all areas including infrastructure, R&D, energy transition, technology, skilling, and social welfare. The surprising reduction in fiscal deficit of 5.8% as against the budgeted 5.9% for FY24 and the projection of 5.1% in FY25 with a clear focus on increasing investments was a huge positive.This was a budget for everyone and all because it caters to every part of the Indian economy and society. The FM has carefully catered to the investment needs of various sectors. The continued focus on youth, impoverished, women and farmers to increase their involvement and contribution to economic growth is evident. By committing an 11.1% increase in capital expenditure to 11,11,111 lakh crore, the FM has clearly brought every single 1 in this growth journey.What was very impressive was the inclusion strategy of the government. The focus on women's empowerment for the past few years is unprecedented, which is reflected in the inclusion of women in the workforce moving from 23.3% to 37% in the last five years. The thirty crore Mudra Yojna loans to women entrepreneurs were a great boost to the Nari Shakti initiative. We already have over 10 million Lakhpati Didis and what is truly evident is like a corporate CFO, the FM has revised the earlier target of 20 million Lakhpati Didis to 30 million. The government also plans to invest in initiatives to encourage young girls between the ages of 9 and 14 to undertake the vaccination for cervical cancer which is again a great boost to Nari Shakti.A lot needs to be done to bring more women into all parts of economic growth but the journey so far and the vision of the future is truly inspiring.While India continues on its technological prowess and makes its mark in new technologies like Artificial Intelligence, we need a multi-pronged strategy to harness the power of AI. We need a clear focus on building AI systems in India so that we not only emerge as a global leader in this new era but can build models, which are specific to India that will benefit Indians. At the same time, we need a very wide coverage program to build skills to leverage AI to its fullest potential. The biggest contribution we can make to the inclusion of youth in the economic development of the country is by skilling them in new skill areas. In the last few years, the Skill India Mission has trained 14 million youth, reskilled over 5 million youth and established a staggering 3,000 new ITIs. The future of any country will depend as much on capital investments as on skill investments.The focus on agricultural development and support to the farmer continues through direct financial assistance to farmers. The farmers have benefited by getting crop insurance through PM Fasal Bima Yojana. It's not just the farmers, the PM-SVANidhi provides credit assistance to a large number of street vendors.The last few years have seen the journey of affordable housing through Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY). There is a slight increase in allocation to launch a scheme for encouraging the middle class to build or buy new homes. This investment will likely propel a wider economic development and increase employment.India has seen a tremendous rise in entrepreneurship in the last few years. In order to continue the journey and promote new startups, the government proposes to extend certain tax benefits, which are expiring from March 2024 to March 2025. The MSMEs have not been left behind. With a proposal to provide timely finances to such enterprises, the government has paved the way for their growth, so they can look to compete globally.All in all, it’s a truly inclusive budget with a clear focus on development not just by giving away freebies but enabling the people to participate in the economic development activity. While the FM calls the comprehensive GDP - Governance, Development & Performance – to me, this budget is inclusive of another GDP – gender, demography, and professions.","Akhilesh Tuteja is Partner and Head, Clients and Markets, KPMG in India.

‘Enough domestic sources of demand to counter drag from external sector’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/enough-domestic-sources-of-demand-to-counter-drag-from-external-sector/articleshow/107372012.cms,"Do you think the

creates room for lower interest rates?

One of the issues that the Budget has flagged is the demographic challenge and opportunity and the societal change that is taking place. How do you view this?

Niti Aayog is working on the Viksit Bharat roadmap. What will be the focus areas?

You are as much a representative of the Centre as well as the states. Is it time to revisit the entire formula for transfers to states particularly on the issue of cesses and surcharges?

Suman Bery , who heads Niti Aayog , the govt think tank, is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China, which he says is also an opportunity for India. The economist is confident that Indian states remain resilient. Excerpts of the interview with TOI.The finance ministry expects the economy to grow 7% next year.Given the global situation, how do you see the prospects?The belief in the finance ministry is that we have a possible drag coming from the external sector but that we have other sources. We have enough domestic sources of demand. One has to applaud the political and economic judgment of FM in deciding that it was appropriate to pursue the path of fiscal consolidation. There is transparency. What this actually reflects is responsible economic management, which is one reason we are where we are. Second, it also creates a buffer so that there is policy space if we do encounter headwinds.That’s the hope and expectation. We have an independent central bank and an inflation targeting central bank, so it is up to the monetary policy committee to take a call through the monetary policy committee on the repo rate .The PM has said that when India grows its states grow. India is a composite of 37 states and UTs. They are each at very different points in their demographic transition. There are some states where the net replacement rate is down to 1%, like Kerala . There are others, particularly UP and Bihar, which are in their earliest stage of demographic transition and each one of these states is the size of a large European country. There are two implications of that — one is internal labour mobility and it will become an even larger part of our growth model. The govt has taken several steps to create a unified market. Our main endowment is our human capital and that has to be equipped to participate in global exchange in many ways. We know from China, Japan that the demographic dividend partly depends on markets and on human capital. But the golden period is fairly short lived, about 15 years, when the so called dependency ratio declines. The other big opportunity the PM has been highlighting is bringing women much more into the active labour force.When Niti was set up there was the idea of a three-year vision and a seven-year strategy paper. The reality is that schemes of govt tend to be aligned with the award of the Finance Commission . There are various established building blocks or hand holds which are already a matter of govt policy. The PM is much more interested in a national debate on what it means to be a Viksit Bharat or modern society. We have a collective goal and it is for the democratic polity to define what that goal should be. Its emphatically not for a super mandarin bureaucracy. It is not going to be Lee Kwan Yew’s Singapore led from the top.It’s entirely a finance ministry matter but I would be lying if I didn’t say when I visit certain states there is this complaint. A big frontier would be resource mobilisation at the state level. Second is going to be rationalisation of subsidies not only at the Union level, but also at the state level. All chief ministers sit on my governing council. When they convene as the governing council, I see them in their role as development practitioners. The world is beginning to appreciate quite how much institutional and political maturity India attained in our 75 years and the most fundamental dimension of a democracy, we have orderly transfers of power. There are enough buffers to ensure that what happens in state finances is unlikely to create macro instability. Those risks are well contained by our Constitution. The chief ministers know that they are going to be judged by development outcomes and so you can have the sugar rush of changing of pension plans or various handouts but if the cupboard is bare you are not going to be able to deliver.","Suman Bery is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China.

Government's Marathon to 2047: Emphasis on Fiscal Prudence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/governments-marathon-to-2047-emphasis-on-fiscal-prudence/articleshow/107371788.cms,"What was the thinking behind keeping the vote on account absolutely straight?

So is it the idea to keep the Budget completely transparent?

The capex has risen 11.1% and there is an emphasis on infrastructure spending. But there is also the hope that the private sector will now take over and start capital spending. Given the geopolitical situation, how confident is the govt that it will pan out as planned?

Finance secretary T V Somanathan, in an interview with TOI, says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047 . Excerpts:If you see the Budget speech you will see the emphasis on 2047. The govt has set its sight on running that marathon.Running to 2047 is a marathon , it’s not a sprint. If you are going to run a marathon, you need to be in good shape and you can’t have short-term stimulants or something that will get you some yards and then it’s done.The whole focus is on making India a developed country by 2047, for which a healthy present and a strong fiscal position is an important concomitant. Some purely short term measures don’t really fit into that picture. It’s a consistent picture: focus on the long term for which you need to build strength in the short term and that needs to be done by prudence in fiscal policy and by not doing things which can detract you from that path. Not doing the wrong thing is more important than appearing to do things.The idea is that govt finances may be good, bad or indifferent depending on the times, depending on the circumstances, depending on the policies. But what is the position should be reflected as reasonably and accurately as possible. That is an emphasis. As regards the Finance Commission, again the terms of reference that have been given to them are the terms in the Constitution.What is the means by which the devolution should be done is a matter they have full discretion. They can actually take all kinds of factors into account and in a sense we felt this time based on my review of the previous commissions that the right expression would be less is more. The shorter, less prescriptive terms of reference gives full scope for all stakeholders including state govts to express their viewpoints and for the commission to take a balanced view of the different perspectives and then come to its award. Ultimately the award of the Finance Commission is about devolution and grant for which full scope has now been given to them.n There are incipient signs of private capital expenditure accelerating. There are some surveys I have seen done by some of the chambers industry, which show high levels of investment. The PMI, which is a sort of leading indicator, is also looking pretty healthy. Capacity utilisation is one reason that private sector capital expenditure doesn’t immediately pick up when the economy starts accelerating because there is surplus capacity.But increasingly I get the sense that many industries are beginning to reach levels where they have to add capacity. When that happens capital investment will happen. Another pointer also mentioned in the Budget speech you may notice that our airlines have placed large orders for planes — that is capital expenditure.When you import 1,000 aircraft, it’s just not 1,000 aircraft, there are concomitant additions to ground handling facilities, you need airports to expand, you need to employ people to do that. That means a lot of jobs. The aircraft is capital but then look at the effect it is going to have on skilled jobs. So capital expenditure is happening. I am fairly confident that we will have decent capital expenditure in the year to come and that will become a new source of acceleration.",Finance secretary T V Somanathan says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047.

Income Tax Changes Budget 2024 : In the recent Budget 2024 speech, the Finance Minister kept the Section 80C tax deduction limit unchanged. The maximum limit for claiming tax benefits under Section 80C remains at Rs 1.5 lakh for the current fiscal year 2023-24 and will stay the same for individuals looking to save on taxes through Section 80C investments in the upcoming fiscal year 2024-25.Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions. Individuals can reduce their gross taxable income by up to Rs 1.5 lakh per financial year by engaging in these specific investments or expenditures.You can save on taxes through Section 80C by investing in things like Employees' Provident Fund (EPF), Public Provident Fund (PPF), Equity Linked Saving Scheme (ELSS) mutual funds, National Savings Certificate (NSC), and 5-year tax-saving fixed deposits with banks or post offices. Additionally, paying life insurance policy premiums also qualifies for tax benefits under Section 80C.It is important to note that each eligible investment comes with its specific maximum limit, rate of return, liquidity, and taxation rules for the earned returns, states ET in a report. For instance, the most you can invest in PPF in a financial year is Rs 1.5 lakh. Meanwhile, there's no limit on the amount you can invest in ELSS mutual funds, but the Section 80C deduction is capped at Rs 1.5 lakh.If individuals can't make specific investments, they can still get deductions under Section 80C from their gross taxable income through certain expenses. These expenses include repaying the principal amount of a home loan, tuition fees for children, payment of stamp duty, registration fees, and other costs related to buying a house.Since the financial year 2020-21, individuals without any business income must annually choose between the old and new tax regimes. As of the fiscal year 2023-24, the new tax regime is the default option. Consequently, individuals seeking tax deductions under Section 80C must opt for the old tax regime since this deduction isn't available in the new tax regime. It's crucial for taxpayers to be aware of these rules to make informed decisions about their tax planning and investment strategies.","Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget which is an interim budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year. The budget talks about inclusive development both, social and geographical, especially for youth, women, farmers, and the poor. Continued focus on improving logistics through infrastructure spend on roads, rail, airports, ports increases productivity for companies and citizens alike.To make ‘Viksit Bharat’ by 2047, the government’s focus is on improving and empowering people’s capabilities through various skilling initiatives. It is encouraging to see that Skill India Mission has succeeded in training more than 1.4 crore youth and upskilling and reskilling 54 lakh youth. I am particularly happy to see the continued focus on youth and women entrepreneurship and the announcement of a new fund which will give interest free 50 year loans for startups will provide a domestic fillip to startups supplementing venture capital we have traditionally relied on from abroad.PM Mudra Yojana has sanctioned 43 crore loans aggregating to 22.5 lakh crore to youth entrepreneurs and thirty crore Mudra Yojana loans to women entrepreneurs. There are several other schemes like Fund of Funds, Start-Up India, and Start-Up Credit Guarantee schemes that are assisting our youth. Further, the extension of tax benefits to Start-ups and investments made by sovereign wealth funds/pension funds, till 31st March 2025 depicts the government’s effort to support the startup eco- system.This aligns quite well with India Sanitation Coalition’s efforts to give impetus to the start-up world. Over the past 7 editions of our ISC-FICCI Sanitation Awards, we have recognized and promoted several start-ups in the sanitation space, many of whom are successful businesses now!While the finance minister did not provide detailed information on Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH), the budget allocation sees a slight increase in spend demonstrating continued focus on this highly successful program. The acknowledgement that the private sector has increasingly played a substantial role in addressing WASH issues in both urban and rural areas, with numerous projects underway through Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs), highlights the government's commitment to addressing challenges in this sector.A perfect example is the LightHouse Initiative initiated by the Department of Drinking Water along with the India Sanitation Coalition (ISC) by partnering with major corporates across India to develop model villages in Solid and Liquid Waste Management (SLWM) under SBM-Grameen. From this budget, there is an expectation that the government will persist in prioritizing Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) as the path toward achieving the country's Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6). Additionally, it is hoped that the government will uphold its commitment to making necessary infrastructural investments for SLWM.The budget speech rightly celebrates the fact that we have 83 lakh SHGs and 9 crore women beneficiaries. The microfinance movement in the country and the possibility of empowering women members of SHGs through livelihood skilling is a key to bringing women into mainstream economic advancement.The focus on green growth, rooftop solar, wind, biomass, e-vehicles all help with our green energy thrust. The tourism sector was mentioned and could be a huge job provider for youth and women.Guided by the principle ‘Reform, Perform, and Transform’, the budget emphasizes efficient implementation of various policies by improving coordination with states and relevant stakeholders. This is critical both for infra spend and social programsIt is noteworthy that ISC’s Climate Resilient Coastal Cities project which is being implemented in PPP (Public-Private Partnership) mode in four coastal states of Karnataka, Gujarat, Goa and Maharashtra is congruent with the government’s priority of promoting climate-resilient activities for the blue economy 2.0, a scheme for restoration and adaptation measures, and coastal aquaculture.The budget also focuses on the Aspirational districts program where assistance will be given to the states for faster development of aspirational districts and blocks, including the generation of ample economic opportunities. This is again very crucial as it has a huge potential to transform the landscape of our country while making sure no -one is left behind.Overall, this budget has embraced economic strategies and develops the building blocks that nurture and uphold growth, promote inclusive and sustainable development, and enhance productivity.","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year. Continued focus on improving logistics through infrastructure spend on roads, rail, airports, ports increases productivity for companies and citizens alike.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-107357973,imgsize-300646,width-400,resizemode-4/107357973.jpg"

Southern states must focus on component making and move out of electronics assembly: MeitY secretary,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/southern-states-must-focus-on-component-making-and-move-out-of-electronics-assembly-meity-secretary/articleshow/109648090.cms,"‘Double

value addition

of electronics in India’

CHENNAI: Southern states should move out of labour-intensive electronics assembly and packaging and focus more on higher value-added component manufacturing, secretary to ministry electronics and information technology (MeitY) S Krishnan said on Saturday.Electronics assembly requires a lot of human resources which companies are finding it difficult to find in these southern states and these activities should be moved to states where labour is more easily available.States like Tamil Nadu should become a centre for component manufacturing just like the automobile sector, he added.Krishnan was speaking on ‘Building Economic Resilience Through Technology’ at the G Ramachandran Endowment Lecture in Chennai.“You are (Tamil Nadu) the largest exporter of electronics. It's only because of Apple iPhones, which are exported from Tamil Nadu. But equally when you look at the other part of the story, it's primarily an assembling exercise. So, what happens is you need a large number of people working in those factory shop floors. We do not have a lot of people prepared to work in that. Companies actually find it difficult to mobilize (people) within the state,” he explained.The secretary said value addition in the Indian electronics manufacturing should double to around 40%. Shifting electronics component making from China is essential to move up the value chain. But electronics are part of global value chains, and India can take up local value addition only in areas where it is possible, according to him.The Union government aims at reaching 10% of the global electronics market from around 3% at present. India’s digital economy is expected to go up from 8% to 20%, touching $1 trillion when the country reaches $5 trillion, according to a preliminary study by MeitY.Krishnan explained that shifting electronics manufacturing is crucial for the resilient supply chain, safeguarding the economy from geo-political risks and strategic requirements.","Electronics assembly requires a lot of human resources which companies are finding it difficult to find in these southern states.

"'Get used to living frugally': China asks officials to use own cup, travel by bike",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/get-used-to-living-frugally-china-asks-officials-to-use-own-cup-travel-by-bike/articleshow/109640681.cms,"Drastic measures in everyday governance

China’s economy is battling a barrage of challenges, including a deepening housing slump, fears of a deflationary spiral and high levels of youth unemployment. As China grapples with a myriad of economic challenges , the government is taking significant steps to tighten its belt, particularly among public officials. Amid concerns of an economic slowdown, soaring debt levels, and faltering consumer confidence, China is now enforcing a frugal lifestyle on its public servants in an effort to redirect resources toward more critical areas of need.In response to economic distress, characterized by a $2 trillion loss in stock market value since 2022 and debt levels nearing three times the national economic output, Chinese authorities have initiated widespread budget cuts across provincial governments.For instance, the governor of Guizhou province has pledged to slash his administration’s operating expenses by 15%. Similarly, in Hunan, officials are urged to embody the spirit of ""red housekeepers,"" a term coined to inspire cost-efficient governance that honors the Communist Party's revolutionary roots, a Wall Street Journal report said.The campaign for frugality has resulted in various stringent measures aimed at curbing unnecessary spending. In Yunnan, for instance, a directive has been issued to set air conditioning thermostats no lower than 26 degrees Celsius (79 degrees Fahrenheit) during summer to save on electricity costs. Meanwhile, in Inner Mongolia, authorities are promoting the repair and reuse of office equipment like desks and chairs instead of purchasing new ones.As per the WSJ report, in recent weeks, numerous local governments have rolled out comprehensive guidelines on how to ""get used to living frugally."" These directives instruct staff to economize by utilizing public transport, opting for less expensive stationery, and printing documents in black-and-white and on both sides of the paper. Additional measures include directives for bureaucrats to consume all their food, reduce work-related travel, and extend the lifespan of resources by repairing and reusing everything from official vehicles to office furniture.At a state-owned ironworks in Yunnan, party officials have called for a 30% reduction in annual drinking water expenses compared to last year's expenditure of 270,000 yuan. The plant's party committee issued a directive saying, “Strictly control the consumption of bottled water in each work unit,” and encouraged employees to use their own cups instead of disposable ones to further cut costs, the WSJ report said.These austerity measures are part of a broader strategy to manage the economic fallout from three years of stringent Covid-19 containment measures and a slumping property market, which have severely depleted local government coffers. This fiscal tightening is further compounded by the reduction in land-sale revenues—a key source of income for many localities.The frugality campaign aligns with Chinese leader Xi Jinping 's broader efforts initiated in 2019 to curb government waste. This campaign not only seeks to alleviate fiscal pressures but also serves a significant political purpose, signaling the government's commitment to sharing the burden of economic slowdown. Senior officials and state media have bolstered this message, appealing to public servants' patriotism and framing frugality as a virtue that aligns with the Communist Party’s values. Historical references to past leaders' simple lifestyles are frequently invoked to strengthen this narrative.Despite these efforts, some experts, like Christine Wong, a visiting professor at the National University of Singapore’s East Asian Institute, view these measures as largely symbolic. They argue that the savings from such cuts are relatively minor compared to the broader challenges facing the Chinese economy, such as the need for substantial reforms in local government revenue generation and debt management. Critics contend that while these frugal measures may yield some savings, they do little to address the underlying structural issues that threaten China's long-term economic stability, the WSJ report said.(With inputs from agencies)",China is enforcing a frugal lifestyle on its public servants in an effort to redirect resources toward more critical areas of need.

Tesla autopilot probed after 20 crashes in months since recall,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/tesla-autopilot-probed-after-20-crashes-in-months-since-recall/articleshow/109629790.cms,"The top US auto-safety regulator is again investigating Tesla Inc.’s Autopilot, this time over whether a fix deployed months ago did enough to stop people from misusing the system.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration disclosed Friday that it’s opened a query into the Autopilot recall Tesla conducted in December. The agency is concerned as to whether the company’s remedy was sufficient, in part due to 20 crashes that have occurred involving vehicles that received Tesla’s over-the-air software update .More than 2 million Tesla vehicles are subject to the probe, according to NHTSA . The carmaker’s shares fell as much as 1.7% shortly after the start of regular trading and are down more than 30% this year.The investigation cuts against Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk ’s exuberance about Tesla’s automated-driving systems . The billionaire has set a date in August to unveil a driverless robotaxi, which he said five years ago would be ready by 2020. During an earnings call this week, he downplayed the difficulty of getting the green light from regulators for that vehicle.“I actually do not think that there will be significant regulatory barriers, provided there is conclusive data that the autonomous car is safer than a human-driven car,” Musk said. Later in the call, he said that those who doubt Tesla’s ability to “solve” autonomy shouldn’t invest in the company.Tesla filed its Autopilot recall in December to address concerns NHTSA raised as part of a years-long defect investigation. A portion of the company’s remedy both requires car owners to opt in and allows drivers to readily reverse changes Tesla has made, according to the agency.The carmaker also has deployed Autopilot updates separate from the one disclosed in its December recall that appear to be related to concerns NHTSA had raised as part of its defect probe , the agency said. The latest query will consider why these updates weren’t a part of the recall, NHTSA said.Tesla has taken heat before from NHTSA over deploying software updates to Autopilot without filing a recall. The company did so in September 2021 weeks after the agency opened its defect investigation into the driving system.",More than 2 million Tesla vehicles are subject to the probe.

NEW DELHI: Google 's parent company Alphabet on Thursday announced its first-ever dividend and a $70 billion stock buyback , leading to the stock surge of nearly 16% after the bell. The dividend will be 20 cents per share.Alphabet is returning capital while spending billions of dollars on data centres to compete with rivals on generative artificial intelligence (AI).Alphabet's Big Tech rival, Meta Platforms , three months ago, announced its own first-ever dividend, a move that spiralled the social media company's stock market value by $196 billion the following day.Amazon.com remains the lone holdout among Big Tech firms not offering a dividend.Alphabet beat expectations for the quarter in sales, profit and advertising - metrics that are all closely watched.""Alphabet's announced dividend payouts and buybacks on top of the solid earnings beat are not only a breath of fresh air for the tech market as a whole, but also a very intelligent strategy for the search engine giant going into a tough time of the year,"" said Thomas Monteiro, senior analyst at Investing.com.Alphabet's after-hours share surge of nearly 16% following the report increased its stock market value by about $300 billion to over $2 trillion.In a call to discuss results, CEO Sundar Pichai touted Google's AI offerings as a boon to its core search results. ""We are encouraged that we are seeing an increase in search usage among people who are using the AI overviews,"" he said.Revenue was $80.54 billion for the quarter ended March 31, compared with estimates of $78.59 billion, according to LSEG data.The search firm exceeded expectations for first-quarter revenue due to increased demand for its cloud services driven by the growing use of artificial intelligence and consistent advertising expenditure.Google stated that advertising increased by 13% in the quarter to $61.7 billion. This amount is compared to the average estimate of $60.2 billion, as per LSEG data.Alphabet had a disappointing fourth quarter where advertising sales fell short, leading to a drop in share prices, due to increased competition from companies such as Facebook and emerging platforms like TikTok.TikTok is uncertain about its future following US President Joe Biden 's approval of a bill that could result in a ban on the app if it is not sold within the next nine to 12 months.Meanwhile, revenue from Google Cloud increased by 28% in the initial quarter, driven by a surge in generative artificial intelligence tools that depend on cloud services to provide the technology to clients.Google's cloud services are appealing to startups backed by venture capital that are working on generative AI technologies because of the pricing and seamless integration with other tools, as mentioned by investors and experts in the past.",Alphabet is returning capital while spending billions of dollars on data centres.

'Impending market plunge: Top strategist forecasts 44% S&P 500 crash',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/impending-market-plunge-top-strategist-forecasts-44-sp-500-crash/articleshow/109592631.cms,"NEW DELHI: Paul Dietrich , the chief investment strategist at B Riley Wealth Management , has issued a stark warning that the S&P 500 could plummet by 44 per cent to approximately 2,800 points—a level last seen during the peak of the pandemic in 2020. Dietrich, who has a history of moving his clients' investments from stocks to safer assets like bonds and gold ahead of major market downturns, argues that such preemptive shifts could shield investors from severe financial losses.In his April market commentary, Dietrich recalled how his strategic moves helped his clients avoid the worst impacts of previous market crashes, such as the dot-com bubble burst in 2000 and the 2008 housing crisis.By exiting stocks early, his clients missed the immediate subsequent gains but more crucially avoided the dramatic falls. For instance, during the 2000-2002 recession, while the S&P and Nasdaq plummeted by 49% and 78% respectively, Dietrich’s clients saw a net gain of 7 per cent before fees, a report in Insider said.Drawing parallels with past market conditions, Dietrich highlighted several indicators suggesting an impending downturn. He pointed to ""wildly overvalued"" stock valuations , historical data showing average declines of 36 per cent in past recessions, and various economic signals flashing red, including a spike in the so-called Buffett Indicator and record high gold prices.Despite these ominous signs, Dietrich noted that the predicted recession has been delayed due to significant government spending, consumer debt accumulation, and a tight labor market showing early signs of stress. He remains cautious, forecasting a mild US recession this year, exacerbated by high interest rates and ongoing global economic pressures, the Insider report said.While some of Wall Street’s leading figures, like JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon and Goldman Sachs' David Solomon, have echoed concerns about underestimating market risks, legendary investors like Warren Buffett have historically advised against trying to time the market. Buffett advocates for consistent investment strategies like dollar-cost averaging as opposed to reactionary selling and buying based on market predictions.Dietrich’s warnings invite skepticism, especially considering the stock market’s resilience in recent years against numerous dire forecasts. Nevertheless, his track record and detailed analysis present a cautionary tale for investors about the potential for significant market corrections in the near future.","Paul Dietrich, the chief investment strategist at B Riley Wealth Management, has issued a stark warning that the S&P 500 could plummet by 44 per cent to approximately 2,800 points.

Is China stockpiling oil and other resources in case of future war?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/is-china-stockpiling-oil-and-other-resources-in-case-of-future-war/articleshow/109589412.cms,"Communications

LONDON: In the eastern Chinese port of Dongying, the start of 2024 has often seen several tankers docked simultaneously discharging Russian crude oil into a new 31.5 million barrel storage facility completed late last year.It is, traders say, all part of a concerted and deliberate Chinese effort to build up strategic stockpiles for a perhaps uncertain future.Estimates of China's total strategic energy reserve vary from 280 to 400 million barrels, the upper amount exceeding the US strategic petroleum reserve at roughly 364 million. China consumes some 14 million barrels a day of oil in peacetime.What does seem clear, however, is that China is deliberately stockpiling at speed, part of a much wider national effort to accumulate essential raw materials and resource.When it comes to energy, much of the new inflows now come primarily from Russia, whose energy exports to China rose by roughly one quarter last year to a record 2.14 million barrels per day.That makes the Kremlin Beijing's largest energy supplier for the second year running, overtaking Saudi Arabia - and allowing China to benefit from substantially discounted Russian oil as US and Western sanctions have turned away multiple other buyers since Vladimir Putin's 2022 invasion of Ukraine.Beijing's stockpiling of oil is just one example of what appears a broad national effort to significantly increase the holdings of key raw materials. It is a move that some increasingly suspect is intended to help insulate Beijing against any future war or international sanctions, such as those that might be sparked by a potential Chinese invasion of Taiwan.In a piece for international affairs and conflict blogging site ""War on the Rocks"" published April 17, Mike Studeman, former commander of the US Office of Naval Intelligence and intelligence and director of the US Indo-Pacific Command, argued that this was part of a much wider process.""Xi Jinping is preparing his country for a showdown,"" he wrote, describing the Chinese leader as ""militarising Chinese society and steeling his country for a potential high-intensity war.""Part of that, he suggested, included building up strategic stockpiles of essential goods and resources, protecting China against the kind of sanctions imposed on Russia after its Ukraine invasion - or, indeed, a militarily enforced blockade as part of a regional or global war.Other examples of heightened preparedness, he said, included the much higher tempo of Chinese military operations around Taiwan - designed to both exercise China's military and implicitly threaten the government in Taipei with the consequences of its own total military blockade.US officials say they believe Xi has given his armed forces until 2027 to be prepared to invade Taiwan, although those inside and outside the US government remain divided on whether a decision to actually attack has genuinely been made.This week, the outgoing head of the US Indo-Pacific Command said Beijing was continuing to plough resources into its military despite economic turmoil caused by a real estate crisis and a slump in US-China trade.""Despite a failing economy, there is a conscious decision to fund military capability,"" Admiral John Aquilino told a naval conference in Japan. ""That's concerning to me.""What is clear, Western experts and officials say, is that the government in Beijing has learned multiple lessons from Russia's troubled experience in Ukraine.These include the desirability of managing any military takeover extremely quickly, presenting the outside world - and particularly the US - with a lightning change of government in Taiwan's capital Taipei before anyone can truly react.Over the last year, US President Joe Biden and counterpart Xi have held one relatively cordial meeting in California in November and at least one follow-on bilateral telephone call, while military officials have held direct meetings aimed at finding ways to ensure communication and reduce tensions in any future crisis.So far, neither Washington nor other Western states have moved to significantly cut China off from raw materials, although the US has increasingly worked to strip Beijing of access to high-tech microchips, particularly those that could be used for weapons.European states remain publicly divided over their approaches to Beijing, with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz visiting China this month in what appeared to be an effort to maintain ongoing trade links.German officials say Scholz pressed Chinese counterparts including Xi on multiple issues including human rights and Beijing's support for Russia in Ukraine.More broadly, however, Western-Chinese relations continue to deteriorate - and not just over Taiwan, which Beijing views as a rogue province with which it vows to pursue ""reunification"" either peaceably or by force.This month, US secretary of state Anthony Blinken told fellow Nato foreign ministers that ever more Chinese components were being found inside Russian weapons in Ukraine. Beijing's support for Moscow, Blinken said, was approaching the threshold of delivering lethal weapons systems.This week also saw two rounds of arrests in Europe linked to alleged espionage by China, including two parliamentary researchers in Britain and three Germans working on defense programs. China's embassies in both countries denied involvement in spying.Having initially recovered following the Covid pandemic, US-Chinese trade nosedived in 2023 and so far shows little signs of recovering.Officials in both the US and Europe also say they are considering introducing trade tariffs on Chinese production of electric vehicles in particular, accusing Beijing of deliberate overproduction in a way that threatens US and European rivals.Should such tariffs be introduced, relations would almost certainly deteriorate still further.China's government buyers have never been ones to turn down a bargain, frequently building up their national stockpiles when short-term prices fall. Newly imposed Western sanctions on Russian nickel, aluminium and copper that entered force this month are seen as likely to spur further Chinese buying.When it comes to lithium, a vital component in many types of battery, Beijing has bought up not just stock but also processing facilities and mines, including overseas.In March, investment bank UBS estimated that China might control a third of all global lithium supply as soon as 2025, again exploiting a price crash to further build its holdings.A US geological survey report from 2016 showed China's mineral deposits containing aluminium, cadmium, cobalt, copper, gallium, germanium, iridium, tantalum, tin, tungsten, zinc and zirconium as well as other rare earth elements.Since then, China has sometimes sold off elements of its strategic reserves when prices have been particularly high, thereby reducing the costs for Chinese industry. More broadly, however, those stockpiles have continued to grow.When it comes to one particular commodity, those purchases appear to go well beyond the government. Chinese consumers and companies, as well as state institutions, have been on a particular buying spree this year for gold, pushing its global price to a record high above $2,400 an ounce.That has prompted speculation that China is about to make a concerted effort to wean itself and other major emerging economies off their long-term dependence on the US dollar.But it may also be a reflection that China's elite expect a more dangerous-feeling world over the rest of the 2020s and beyond, and would rather consolidate their wealth within Chinese borders well before that situation worsens.","China's energy exports to China rose by roughly one quarter last year to a record 2.14 million barrels per day.

Hydrocracking technology can produce SAF at lower costs: Honeywell,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/hydrocracking-technology-can-produce-saf-at-lower-costs-honeywell/articleshow/109588416.cms,"MUMBAI: Honeywell on Thursday announced its hydrocracking technology can be used to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) from biomass, helping to make sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) that is 90% less carbon intensive than traditional fossil-based jet fuels.“The new technology produces 3-5% more SAF enables a cost reduction of up to 20% and reduces by-product waste streams as compared to other commonly used hydroprocessing technologies,” said the company in a press statement.The Fischer-Tropsch (FT) UnicrackingTM technology takes liquids and waxes from processed biomass – including leftovers from crops, wood waste or food scraps – and can be used to produce SAF that complies with the strict standards of the aviation industry and with a lower environmental impact, said the Honeywell statement.In October last year, Honeywell had announced plans to realign its business segments to three compelling megatrends: automation, the future of aviation, and energy transition. The company had announced that the new segmentation will take effect beginning first quarter 2024. The latest innovation involving hydrocracking technology for production of SAF demonstrates the alignment of its portfolio with the three megatrends, it added.“As demand for SAF continues to grow, the aviation industry is challenged by limited supplies of traditional SAF feedstocks such as vegetable oils, animal fats and waste oils,” said Ken West, president and CEO of Honeywell Energy and Sustainability Solutions. “When combined with the existing Fischer-Tropsch process, our new technology will expand the feedstock options available in the industry to sources that are more plentiful, ultimately helping improve our customers’ ability to produce SAF.”Recently, DG Fuels selected Honeywell’s FT Unicracking technology for its biofuels manufacturing facility in Louisiana – the largest in the world for making SAF from the FT process – that will produce 13,000 barrels of SAF each day when it begins operations in 2028.“Using Honeywell's advanced technology, DG Fuels will supply enough fuel for more than 30,000 transatlantic flights every year, contributing significantly to reducing the carbon emissions of global air travel,” said Michael Darcy, CEO of DG Fuels. “This is a big leap forward in supporting the airline industry's goal of reaching net zero carbon emissions from international aviation by 2050.”“Honeywell helped pioneer SAF production with its Ecofiningprocess, which has been used to produce the fuel commercially since 2016. The company now offers solutions across a range of feedstocks to meet the rapidly growing demand for renewable fuels, including SAF,” said the company. In addition to Honeywell Unicracking and Ecofining, Honeywell's renewable fuels portfolio includes Ethanol to Jet technology and eFining™, which converts green hydrogen and carbon dioxide into e-fuels. More than 50 sites globally have licensed Honeywell's SAF technologies, with refineries projected to exceed a combined capacity of more than 500,000 barrels of SAF per day when fully operational.",Honeywell's hydrocracking technology can be used to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) from biomass. Fischer-Tropsch (FT) UnicrackingTM technology takes liquids and waxes from processed biomass.

New rules require airlines to automatically refund consumers for cancelled flights in US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/new-rules-require-airlines-to-automatically-refund-consumers-for-cancelled-flights-in-us/articleshow/109580490.cms,"Departure or arrival time that moves by more than three hours domestically or six hours for international flights

Airlines will now have to provide automatic refunds to travelers if flights are canceled or significantly altered under new US Department of Transportation rules, a significant change for consumers that could drive up costs across the industry.The final regulations released Wednesday outline the circumstances where passengers are entitled to refunds for all travel to, from and within the US.The goal is to make it easier for people to get money back and to make refund policies more consistent from one airline to the next.According to the department, complaints related to airlines and ticket agents rejecting or delaying refunds made up 87% of all air-travel service complaints at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020.“Passengers deserve to get their money back when an airline owes them — without headaches or haggling,” Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said in a statement.Under the new rule, passengers will be entitled to refunds if there is a “significant change” to their flights.These include:Travelers will also get refunds for checked bag fees if the bag is lost and not delivered within 12 hours of a domestic flight’s gate arrival. International flights will have from 15 to 30 hours to return a lost bag, depending on their length.Anyone who pays for a service, such as in-flight Wi-Fi or entertainment, and doesn’t receive it will also get their money back.In addition, DOT made changes to make it easier for the passengers to receive the money they’re owed by requiring prompt automatic refunds in cash or through the original form of payment. Buttigieg said during a news conference at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport Wednesday that the bulk of the new requirements will go into effect in about six months.The refund changes are poised to add significant costs across the airline industry, which could have a disproportionate impact on low-cost carriers, according to Seaport Research analyst Daniel McKenzie. “To the extent low cost carriers have to add costs to comply, reduce growth and/or downsize, they become less competitive,” McKenzie said in a note.The Airlines for America trade group said in a statement that its member carriers already abide by and often exceed regulation on consumer protection.“US airlines are providing more options and better services while ticket prices, including ancillary revenues, are at historic lows,” the group said in a release.Also on Wednesday, the department released a final rule requiring airlines to clearly communicate their extra fees upfront for checked luggage, carry-on bags or for canceling or changing reservations. According to DOT, airlines saw a 30% increase in revenue from baggage fees between 2018 and 2022.“Airlines should compete with one another to secure passengers’ business — not to see who can charge the most in surprise fees,” Buttigieg said in a separate statement, adding that the rule will save travelers more than half a billion dollars a year.Buttigieg told reporters at the news conference that more rules are on the way, including to expand rights for passengers who use wheelchairs and to allow parents to sit with their children on flights without being charged a fee.DOT will also continue to pursue more aggressive enforcement when airlines violate rules, he said, pointing to the department’s $140 million record fine against Southwest Airlines Co. for a meltdown in its operations that left more than 2 million passengers stranded in December 2022.“The level of toughness reflected in the Southwest enforcement is not an exception, but the new standard,” Buttigieg said.",The US Department of Transportation released final regulations on refunds Wednesday. The goal is to make it easier for people to get money back and to make refund policies more consistent from one airline to the next.

TikTok ban in US: How China may retaliate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/tiktok-ban-in-us-how-china-may-retaliate/articleshow/109578157.cms,"Now that President Joe Biden has signed off on a law that could expel TikTok from the US market, Beijing must decide how best to retaliate over an attack on the world’s most-valuable start-up.The legislation approved on Wednesday would give Chinese parent company ByteDance Ltd nearly a year to divest the video-sharing platform before facing an outright ban.At a daily briefing hours before, China’s foreign ministry directed reporters to a vow by commerce officials last month to take “measures to resolutely safeguard its legitimate rights and interests.”President Xi Jinping ’s government has so far shown restraint in responding to a drumbeat of US trade curbs during a hawkish election season. The Communist Party’s moderation has been made easier by Biden’s choice of largely symbolic actions, such as tariffs on metals China exports little of to America.Driving TikTok — or its Chinese owner — out of the US could challenge that calibration, making American firms with large exposure to China’s market, including Apple Inc and Tesla Inc, potential targets for retaliation. Officials last year displayed their willingness to respond in kind to a US campaign to kneecap Beijing’s access to advanced semiconductors, for example, by launching a probe into American memory chipmaker Micron Technology Inc.“China is keeping options open at the moment,” said Xiaomeng Lu, director of the geo-technology practice at Eurasia Group. But she said if TikTok exhausts its legal options and has to exit America, “some US tech brands could be at risk of becoming the collateral damage of this tit-for-tat cycle.”Beijing’s internet restrictions have already forced most American social media firms out of the Chinese market, such as Meta Platforms Inc. and Snap Inc., narrowing the list of potential targets for a tit-for-tat response. Any Chinese action would likely try to avoid inflicting harm on its own economy, as policymakers battle a property crisis that’s weighing on growth along with weak domestic demand.The ratcheting up of trade tensions comes as Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrives in China this week to press US concerns about Chinese companies’ support for Russia’s war machine. The Biden administration has threatened Beijing with sanctions on its banks if they bolster the Kremlin’s campaign in Ukraine, a move that risks hurting US cooperation with China in other geopolitical hot spots such as the Middle East and North Korea.Another consideration would be the optics, after foreign investment into China slumped to a 30-year low in 2023. Xi traveled to San Francisco to woo American CEOs in November and rolled out the red carpet for executives in Beijing this year, as officials ramp up efforts to boost sentiment.“If they sanction US companies this could intensify American firms’ concerns about operating in there,” said Wei Zongyou, a professor in American security and foreign policy at Fudan University in Shanghai. “That means the likelihood of taking further restrictions and sanctions on companies in China is not that big.”Still, China has other, less well-documented weapons at its disposal — including restricting US access to the world’s No. 2 economy, a persistent point of friction between Beijing and Washington.Chinese agencies and government-backed firms ordered staff to stop bringing iPhones and other foreign devices to work last year, in an unprecedented prohibition that’s likely to clip Apple sales in China. Tesla Inc.’s electric vehicles are already subject to restrictions in government compounds, due to concerns about data being collected by the cameras built into the cars.The danger is Beijing will ratchet up semi-official moratoriums on the use of American hardware, potentially pressuring companies like Microsoft Corp and Intel Corp. Many major firms operate influential lobbies in the US and have been known to oppose broader American sanctions for fear of losing market access.Intel was forced to walk away from its $5.4 billion takeover of Tower Semiconductor Ltd. last year after failing to win Chinese regulatory approval in time, a move seen by some in Washington as a response to Biden’s sweeping chip curbs.While Xi has a long-term objective for tech independence, alienating foreign firms in that sector would only slow China’s development, according to Li Mingjiang, associate professor at Nanyang Technological University’s S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies. “What China wants now is to reduce tech decoupling with the US,” he said. “Punishing a US tech company will not be helpful for this purpose.”The most likely immediate action China will take is trying to prevent TikTok being sold to an American entity. Beijing could leverage export controls it imposed in 2020 over content-regulation algorithms, which are the heart of the platform’s global success — a move that would force ByteDance to exit the US market rather than acquiesce to a sale.The company itself has said it would take legal action if the bill is signed into law. That would see the platform rely on the First Amendment argument, as it has done to fend off a state ban in Montana, in an effort that could span years.In another twist, Biden’s challenger Donald Trump — who previously tried to ban the app while in the White House — could end up giving the platform a reprieve, if he wins the November election. The former US president has raised concerns banning TikTok would elevate its rival Meta.For now, Beijing has to wait to see how the US election plays out, said Zhu Feng, executive dean of Nanjing University’s School of International Studies, highlighting that the legislation has an impact on both nations.This kind of ban doesn’t only hurt China, he added, “it hurts the 170 million American users of this app.”",President Joe Biden has signed off on a law that could expel TikTok from the US market. Beijing must decide how best to retaliate over an attack on the world’s most-valuable start-up. The legislation would give Chinese parent company ByteDance Ltd nearly a year to divest the video-sharing platform.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109603305,imgsize-1146732,width-400,resizemode-4/109603305.jpg"
