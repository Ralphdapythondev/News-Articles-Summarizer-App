Stock market crash today: Indian equity benchmark indices, BSE Sensex and Nifty50, plunged in trade on Friday. BSE Sensex plummeted over 1,000 points below 81,300 and the Nifty50 fell below the 24,900 mark. BSE Sensex ended the day at 81,183.93, down 1,017 points or 1.24%. Nifty50 ended the day at 24,852.15, down 293 points or 1.17%.During the trading session, BSE Sensex dropped as much as 1,219.23 points or 1.48 percent to 80,981.93.This marked the third consecutive day of losses for both indices.Among the Sensex constituents, State Bank of India suffered the most, with a decline of over 4 percent. Other major losers included NTPC, ICICI Bank, HCL Technologies, Reliance Industries, Axis Bank, and ITC. However, a few companies, such as Bajaj Finance, Asian Paints, JSW Steel, and Maruti, managed to post gains.Investors remained cautious ahead of the crucial US jobs report, which could influence the Federal Reserve's decision on interest rate cuts. The market capitalization of all listed companies on the BSE decreased by Rs 4.8 lakh crore, reaching Rs 460.85 lakh crore, according to an ET report.nvestors are feeling increasingly apprehensive as they await the release of the US non-farm payrolls report later today, causing a downturn in Indian equity markets. In a recent statement, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell stressed that policymakers are not in favor of further weakening in the labor market, paving the way for a potential rate cut in September.Market experts anticipate an increase of 165,000 new jobs and a slight decrease in the unemployment rate to 4.2%. However, worries are growing after soft job openings and fewer gains in the private sector raised the probability of a half-point rate cut to 42%.""If the August jobs data, due later today, falls short of expectations and unemployment rises higher than forecast, the Fed may cut by 50 basis points,"" said Dr. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services.""However, this may not be well-received by the market, as serious growth concerns and fears of a hard landing for the US economy could weigh heavily,"" he added., the decline in bank stocks was driven by concerns over upcoming data on bank loan and deposit growth, with the widening gap between deposit and credit growth raising concerns about potential liquidity issues.Recent data from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) shows that deposits increased by 11.7% in the June 2024 quarter, while bank credit surged by 15%. The growing gap between deposit and credit growth has raised concerns about potential liquidity issues, heightening investor anxiety and contributing to the drop in bank stocks., major Asian markets in Seoul, Tokyo, Shanghai, and Hong Kong also closed lower. European markets were trading in the red, while the US markets mostly ended in negative territory on Thursday. Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) continued to sell Indian equities , offloading Rs 688.69 crore on Thursday, according to exchange data.In the global commodities market, Brent crude oil prices rose slightly by 0.14 percent to USD 72.79 a barrel.","BSE Sensex dropped over 1,000 points below 81,300 and the Nifty50 fell below the 24,900 mark.

Delhi-Dehradun expressway status: Travel from Delhi to Dehradun in 2.5 hours soon,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/delhi-dehradun-expressway-status-travel-from-delhi-to-dehradun-in-2-5-hours-soon-details-here/articleshow/113013752.cms,"Delhi-Dehradun Expressway: Top Facts

Once finished, the travel time from Akshardham in Delhi to Dehradun will be reduced to just two and a half hours, compared to the current six hours. Similarly, commuters will be able to reach Haridwar from Delhi in two hours.

The 264-km expressway and the Haridwar link, with a total cost of around Rs 14,285 crore, are fully funded by the government. The project boasts special features, including ""Asia's longest elevated wildlife corridor (12 km) and animal underpass,"" which aim to minimize man-animal conflict in the Rajaji National Park and Shiwalik Reserve forest areas.

NHAI sources have indicated that the first leg of the expressway, stretching from Akshardham to the Eastern Peripheral Expressway (EPE) interchange, is expected to be operational by November this year.

This section passes through areas such as Geeta Colony, Shastri Park, and Sonia Vihar in Delhi, as well as Vijay Vihar, Kasim Vihar, and Mandola in Uttar Pradesh. The opening of this stretch is anticipated to provide relief to many commuters from daily traffic congestion.

The Delhi-EPE access-controlled section, spanning 32 kilometers, includes an impressive 19 kilometers of elevated roadway. This elevated portion is designed to accommodate through traffic, while the six-lane service road below will cater to local traffic needs.

The Delhi-Dehradun expressway will offer seven entry points for vehicles traveling from Delhi to Uttar Pradesh, located at Akshardham, Geeta Colony, Shamshan Ghat (Kailash Nagar), Sonia Vihar, Vijay Vihar, and Mandola. Exits will be provided at Khajuri Chowk, Sonia Vihar, Vijay Vihar, and Mandola.

On the other hand, traffic moving from Uttar Pradesh to Delhi will have entry points at Mandola, Vijay Vihar, and 5th Pusta, with exits available at Mandola, Loni, Vijay Vihar, Usmanpur, Shamshan Ghat (Kailash Nagar), Geeta Colony, and Akshardham. Commuters entering and exiting the expressway within Delhi will be exempt from paying tolls, according to an ET report.

Delhi-Dehradun Expressway status: Come December 2024, you may be able to travel between Delhi and Dehradun in just 2.5 hours! The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) plans to open the New Delhi-Dehradun Expressway for traffic by December. The same has been communicated to Prime Minister Narendra Modi by the road transport ministry officials during a recent meeting.However, the link connecting the expressway to Haridwar only will be ready by May 2025. The Prime Minister instructed the ministry to ensure timely completion of the project without any delays. Sources told TOI recently that all land-related issues have been resolved, and the NHAI has committed to finishing the remaining work on the Delhi-Dehradun expressway within the next four months.The access-controlled link from the expressway to Haridwar was a later addition to the project, and the NHAI will require an additional five months to complete it.","The 264-km Delhi-Dehradun expressway is expected to be completed by December 2024.

Source: ET quoting Paisabazaar for interest rates data as on August 14, 2024.

Highest Fixed Deposit Interest Rates: Fixed deposits (FDs) offered by banks are secure and interest-generating investment options. With FDs, you can expect a guaranteed return on your invested funds, which remain unaffected by market fluctuations. This is the reason that FDs are a go to investment option for most risk averse investors.Interest rates for fixed deposits are near all time highs, with RBI pausing the rate cycle for several monetary policy meetings now.Investors have the flexibility to choose between the re-investment deposit option, which allows for the accumulation of compound interest, or the option to receive interest payments at regular intervals (monthly/quarterly) to support their financial planning and budgeting needs, notes an ET report.The interest rates offered on fixed deposits in August 2024 can vary based on several factors, including the specific bank, the age of the depositor, the tenure of the deposit, and the amount invested.In India, private banks are financial institutions where private companies or individuals hold the majority of the equity, in contrast to public-sector banks where the government is the primary shareholder.Public Sector Undertaking (PSU) banks are ones where the government owns the majority of the shares. These banks receive government subsidies with the aim of facilitating their growth and expansion.For investors interested in comparing fixed deposit interest rates between private and public sector banks, a brief analysis of the fixed deposit rates offered to both general citizens and senior citizens is provided below.","Public Banks: Latest Fixed Deposit Interest Rates For General Citizens.

However, they sold equities worth Rs 904.19 crore on Friday.The change in sentiment was primarily due to the expiration of the Securities and Exchange Board of India's ( Sebi ) deadline for unregistered FPIs to disclose their beneficial owners on Friday.The market regulator has mandated that all foreign investors provide details of their ultimate beneficial owners by this deadline, and failure to comply would result in disqualification from investing in Indian markets. Additionally, non-compliant FPIs would be required to liquidate their existing investments.""The domestic market was in panic due to the SEBI's deadline over FIIs disclosure norm, however, this is not expected to impact India's lucrativeness to FIIs in the long-term.

Railway Budget 2024 : The government has wavered little in its efforts to spur a modernisation of railways in the country, pivoting on technology, to support the country’s economic ambitions. In line with expectations, Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore, marking yet another year of successive increase in outlay.That takes forward the past policies and the government’s vision, which have paved the way for modernisation of the transport behemoth.In earlier decades, the government had focused on laying tracks on new routes, electrification and incremental rolling stock capacity addition. That was the need of the hour back then and has helped set up the base for a larger transformation.For instance, the massive Dedicated Freight Corridor ( DFC ) as well as locomotive factories at Marhaura and Madhepura in Bihar were conceptualised over a decade ago and we are seeing their completion now.More recently, the focus has shifted to modernisation—of rolling stock and safety systems, among other aspects.This year, emphasis has also been laid on the railways’ crucial role in industrial development. Commodity-specific corridors have been planned in eastern India and impetus given to port connectivity. Vande Bharat and technology-led upgrades in rolling stock remain in focus. Safety has been prioritised through budgetary allocations for the anti-collision systemKavach . That said, there are other cogs in the wheel that demand attention from a long-term perspective.First, the target for the Operating Ratio, the crucial efficiency gauge, has been set at 98.22% for 2024-25, compared with 98.65% in 2023-24. This reflects an imminent need for operational transformation. An effective overhaul of the world’s fourth-largest rail network will take many years and thus we need to start focusing on improving efficiency and reducing costs now.DFC is almost entirely operational and will be complete over the next few months. To ensure the project achieves its twin goals of reducing logistics costs and enhancing freight efficiency, railways need to attract more cargo on the corridor. This will help increase the rail coefficient and make the railways’ approach more market-oriented, which will in turn aid future corridors.A revamp of railway stations is on track, with sufficient funds dedicated to this end. But even though new coaches and wagons are increasingly being added to meet footfalls, the stations and passenger trains themselves remain synonymous with chaos.Just as safety, comfort and convenience have been prioritised, there is a need for solutions to address the capacity and demand challenges. As a first step, the government could target development of new stations and setting up of new coach production units.As a leading freight mover, Indian Railways carried a record 1,588 MT cargo in fiscal 2024, up from 1,095 MT in fiscal 2015. It accounts for 26% of the cargo moved in the country—by no means an easy feat. The railways aims to take this volume to 3,000 MT by 2030, which would require a 11% CAGR against the around 4.2% witnessed over the last 10 years. As per a report by TERI and Shakti Foundation, from carrying about 62% of freight traffic in 1990-91, Indian Railways’ share has declined to ~27% in 2014-15. This has been due to the expanding road network, cost competitiveness over railways, and door-to-door service. Thus, commencing the cycle of increasing the rail share again is commendable.DFCs, a high-capacity track network, high-power locomotives and improvement in wagon designs have set the ball rolling for larger capacity, faster freight trains that deliver better efficiency.Yet, achieving exponential growth is a tall ask given the current dynamics. Possibly, similar challenges might apply to other goals the railways might have for 2047.To be fair, despite its scale and complexity, Indian Railways has been able to achieve diverse developments at commendable speed.But the track ahead is long and it is time to start discussing the reinvention of the institutional set-up.Indian Railways sees substantial private sector involvement in the form of vendors and contractors. Policymakers could start mulling extreme options such as parallel privately-owned and operated railway infrastructure, coupled with centralised planning and an evolved role for the railways. This will need a robust policy framework from the Government of India.The time is perhaps also ripe to bring user charge and asset monetisation-driven segments for passengers as well as cargo to the discussion table. Globally, the separation of infrastructure and operations in railways has delivered mixed results, for example in the United Kingdom. The model should be analysed and revisited to understand its potential relevance in the Indian context.The key would be to retrace our steps and align our long-term goals to identify not just incremental changes but also ways to explore bold and path-breaking alternatives that put Indian Railways on a smooth track and bring it up to speed.","Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore.

Budget 2024 capital gains tax changes: The Narendra Modi government is considering suggestions for tweaks in the new long term capital gains tax regime that was announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman in Union Budget 2024.The July 23 budget reduced the LTCG tax on property from 20% to 12.5%. The indexation benefit, which allowed taxpayers to adjust the acquisition cost for inflation before calculating capital gains and thus reduce their tax liability, is proposed to be eliminated for properties purchased on or after April 1, 2001.The government publishes the Cost Inflation Index (CII) annually for this calculation.India Inc is appealing to the government for a gradual shift to the long-term capital gains tax regime proposed in the FY25 budget, which aims to eliminate indexation benefits for property, gold, and other unlisted assets.According to an ET report by Deepshikha Sikarwar, the industry is suggesting alternatives such as a higher tax rate with indexation or a lower rate of 12.5% without indexation, as well as some form of grandfathering for ancestral properties.The finance ministry is currently reviewing these proposals and will discuss them with the Prime Minister's Office. The final decision will be made closer to the date when the Finance Bill reply is to be presented in Parliament, the reports said.Industry groups are expected to submit formal proposals to the finance ministry in the near future.

Budget 2024 for manufacturing sector : The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth. While the middle class has been offered tax relief, the government's primary focus remains on judicious spending to maximize economic impact. The budget's core themes are employment, skilling, MSME development, and support for the middle class.Largely focus has remained intact on spending money judiciously to ensure that each penny spent creates a ripple effect in the entire economic landscape.Although at first glance, manufacturing might appear to have taken a backseat, a deeper analysis reveals a multifaceted approach to bolstering the sector. Initiatives like employment-linked benefits and internship programs, while primarily aimed at job creation and skill development, indirectly benefit manufacturing companies by expanding the talent pool.Extensive focus on the MSME manufacturing units by way of extending term loan facility for purchase of machinery and equipment without collateral or third-party guarantee, would help companies in augmenting their capital base/ capacity and strengthen the very foundation of the manufacturing ecosystem in the country. Development of a new credit-assessment model by Public Sector Banks to assess MSME credit shall provide much needed regulatory relief to the units.With respect to the large manufacturing entities, while there is no direct fiscal/ tax incentive introduced in this budget, some support has been provided with an extensive focus on development of ‘industrial parks’ in nearly 100 cities under the ‘plug and play’ model. Reforms proposed with respect to land administration, planning and management, shall also ease out acquisition related difficulties often faced by entrepreneurs/ business houses in acquiring lands for manufacturing set-ups.Targeted Customs duty interventions like, rationalization of Customs duty provisions in Mobile phone manufacturing setups, extension of Customs duty exemption on import of capital goods for manufacturing of solar cells and panels, full Customs duty exemption on import of 25 critical minerals,, shall provide the required impetus for enhancing domestic manufacturing environment.Governments’ focus on formulating an Economic Policy Framework to set the scope for next-gen reforms in the country, has a target to improve the productivity of factors of production, namely, land, labour, capital, entrepreneurship and technology. This shall pave the way for enabling achievement of a target of 25% manufacturing sector contribution to the nation’s GDP over the course of next 7-10 years.While the overall outlook is positive, the extension of tax benefits under Section 115BAB for manufacturing entities and the absence of new PLI schemes are notable omissions.The country’s manufacturing base is expanding as is reflective from the continuously increasing tax collections and expanding Purchasing Manager’s Index. It would be pertinent to see how the ground realities evolve vis-à-vis the vision envisaged, in the upcoming Financial Year.","The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth.

Budget 2024: Armed with the vision to propel India to become a developed country by 2047, the Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business thereby providing the required stimulus to the manufacturing sector and enabling large scale job creation.On the Indirect tax front, the industry welcomes the much-needed announcement for a comprehensive review of the rate structure under Customs enabling ease in product classification and dispute reduction. The proposal of lowering of Customs duty on a plethora of raw materials and products including solar cells, critical minerals and bullion are encouraging measures. The rationale behind such reduction clearly indicates support towards domestic manufacturing, deepening value addition and supporting targets in reducing carbon footprint.Relevant amendments under the Customs law have been made to provide increased time limits for re-imports and re-exports to enhance competitiveness of the fledgling MRO sector. The government has extended significant duty reduction and exemption benefits to the healthcare and electronics sectors, continuing the impetus of incentives provided under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme.Since their introduction in March 2020, the PLI schemes have indeed supported in revitalizing the manufacturing sector and strengthening the necessary supply chains. The success achieved in the mobile manufacturing sector has now enabled the Government to reduce customs duties on mobile phones and components, signalling a mature environment. The Budget proposals aim at reproducing similar outcomes for semiconductor and pharmaceutical industry by increasing the budgetary allocation.Buoyed by the increasing revenue collection under GST signalling a shift towards a mature tax regime, this Budget has harmonized the timeframes for the issuance of demand notices and adjudication orders for cases involving fraud, suppression or otherwise. Significant amendments to the GST legislations have been introduced reflecting the recommendations proposed by the GST Council such as regularizing non-levy of GST due to general practice which may turn out to be a breather for certain impacted industries reeling under huge tax demands.The Insurance sector has been provided much relief through the GST council recommendations which have been cemented in the present budget thereby ending long standing disputes on their business practices.The Government's efforts to push forward with its reform agenda are evident as plans to incentivize states for their business reform actions plans and digitalization through the Jan Vishwas Bill 2.0 is proposed. Further, setting up of e-commerce export hubs is envisaged to facilitate easier access to international markets for domestic players.The recent implementation of Budget proposals allows the government to maintain momentum in its reform agenda. These policy measures implicitly reaffirm the significance of India Inc as a crucial element in the development of infrastructure. However, there are still some expectations required to be met to march towards a Viksit Bharat 2047.",The Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business.

Budget 2024 : Real estate, a significant contributor to employment generation, has received a fair bit of attention in Budget 2024-25. Recent years have seen the sector transform rapidly, driven by factors such as favourable government policies, Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, strong economic growth and changing consumer preferences.Added to that, the budgetary focus on job creation, skilling and employment-linked incentives, infrastructure, urban development, rural connectivity, digitalisation and land-related norms, all dovetail to promote growth of the sector.Launched in June 2015, the PMAY aims to provide affordable housing to all eligible beneficiaries. The budget unveiled PMAY Urban 2.0, under which the housing needs of 1 crore urban poor and middle class will be addressed with an investment of Rs 10 lakh crore.The central government’s additional Rs 2.2 lakh crore injection in the next 5 years to make housing more affordable has the potential to revitalise the affordable housing market.Such an approach can play an important role in realising the government's vision of Housing for All and push growth and development. Hence, the significant investment under PMAY Urban 2.0 is expected to alleviate urban housing deficits, spurring construction and economic growth.Steps to introduce technological reforms within the regulatory framework for land, such as digitalisation or GIS mapping of land records, will improve transparency.Rationalisation of stamp duty across states will also be critical to bring in uniformity and initiate land-related reforms such as urban planning, usage and building bylaws.These are steps in the right direction and will boost growth. Moreover, they will improve the ease of property transactions and strengthen municipal finances through increased property taxes. Rationalization of stamp duty with an emphasis on women homebuyers may boost home-buyer sentiment in major cities, too.The budget has also given ample attention to urban and rural development, with rental housing for industrial workers through the public private partnership model, interest subsidies for rental housing, and transit-oriented developments.The proposal to develop investment-ready plug-and-play industrial parks in 100 cities may attract industrial investment, leading to increased demand for industrial real estate and support the growth of ancillary services and residential developments in these regions.Initiatives for industrial parks and rental housing for industrial workers align with the country’s manufacturing goals and addresses worker accommodation needs.These steps are expected to promote industrial growth and stability in labour-intensive sectors, while also creating new opportunities for real estate developers specialising in rental and affordable housing.The changes in long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax, however, have evoked a mixed reaction. The government lowered the long-term capital gains tax from 20% to 12.5%, which is a welcome step. However, this came with the removal of the indexation benefit.The changes could encourage more liquidity in property transactions and potentially increase the effective tax burden depending on the property’s acquisition date.The launch of Phase IV of the PM Gram Sadak Yojana in 25,000 rural habitations will improve connectivity in rural areas, promoting rural development and making these regions more accessible for investment. The primary objective of PMGSY is to build robust, all-weather roads in rural habitations. This initiative focuses on enhancing connectivity and supporting economic development in rural areas.In essence, the budget is geared towards stimulating growth and investment in the real estate sector , fostering a more transparent and investor-friendly environment, and contributing to overall development. It aims to create a balanced and inclusive growth environment by addressing the needs of various segments, including affordable housing, industrial workers and urban infrastructure.The effectiveness of the initiatives, however, hinges on their implementation and continued support of complementary reforms.","Budget 2024-25 is geared towards stimulating growth and investment in the real estate sector.

New Budget 2024 rule: Why Income Tax Department is likely to issue a huge number of tax notices this month,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-budget-2024-rule-why-income-tax-department-is-likely-to-issue-a-huge-number-of-tax-notices-this-month/articleshow/112186079.cms,"Taxing Times

Income Tax Notice on the way? The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month, as there are concerns that many taxpayers might escape the tax net due to the impending implementation of the new reassessment law on September 1, 2024.According to the amended regulation announced in Budget 2024 , the tax authorities can only go back a maximum of five years to reassess a taxpayer's records if the escaped income is at least Rs 50 lakh, and three years for an amount less than Rs 50 lakh.Previously, they could reassess cases up to 10 years old.According to an ET report, tax officials are now faced with the challenge of compiling and corroborating data on tax and income mismatches for the financial years 2013-14 to 2017-18 within the next few weeks, as these years will become time-barred for reassessment from September 1, 2024.The I-T department relies on information from various sources, such as banks, property registrars, and search findings from the investigation wing, to build reassessment cases.A tax officers' body has raised concerns about the feasibility of issuing notices under Section 148 (or 148A) in a large number of cases within a single month, given the overburdened nature of the jurisdictional assessing officers and the time-consuming process of obtaining sanction from the chief commissioner, who is the specified authority for such notices.Moreover, the law provides taxpayers with the right to explain their position before reassessment orders are finalized, a process that most believe cannot be completed by the end of August.Also Read | ITR refund status for FY 2023-24: How to check income tax refund status online - here’s a step-by-step guide for incometax.gov.in & NSDL websites The Central Board of Direct Taxes ( CBDT ) has been urged by its officers to postpone the effective date of the proposed amendment. However, this suggestion is unlikely to be well-received by corporations and high net worth individuals.""Capping the reassessment period at five years was a great decision as it would reduce hassles and litigation. But if the department fears there could be a genuine loss of revenue as it may not be possible to wrap up several matters by August 31, the government can think of strict parameters where time-bound cases can be selectively reopened - based on trails of steps taken in identifying escaped income,"" said Mitil Chokshi, partner at CA firm Chokshi & Chokshi.""Taxpayers may expect a rush of reassessment notices in August 2024. These notices are likely to be for the AYs 2018-19 and prior to that. It is pertinent to note that the Bombay High Court in a recent ruling in a case of Hexaware Technologies has taken a view on a proviso introduced in 2021, which can be interpreted to mean that AY 2017-18 (and prior years) got time barred on March 31, 2024. These reassessment notices (for AYs 2017-18 and prior) are likely to rake up new interpretation issues in the already muddled reassessment provisions,"" said Ashish Mehta, partner at law firm Khaitan & Co.The current situation is similar to the conflict between the Income Tax office and taxpayers in 2021. The reassessment law was amended in April 2021, allowing the tax office to reopen 10-year-old tax returns if the total undisclosed income exceeded Rs 50 lakh and reassess 4-year-old matters if the amount was less than Rs 50 lakh.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? However, this change led to over 10,000 writ petitions being filed by companies, arguing that they were not given sufficient time to explain and that the notices were issued without considering the carve-out that cases which couldn't be reopened earlier couldn't be reassessed under the new law.The Supreme Court invoked its extraordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution on May 4, 2022, to uphold all reassessment notices issued after March 31, 2021. However, the court left room for judicial proceedings based on the merits of each case, and several such matters are currently pending before the court.","The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month. There are concerns that many taxpayers might escape the tax net due to the impending implementation of the new reassessment law on September 1, 2024. The tax authorities can only go back a maximum of five years to reassess a taxpayer's records if the escaped income is at least Rs 50 lakh.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112186146,imgsize-55630,width-400,resizemode-4/112186146.jpg"

Are NPS Vatsalya & hiked NPS deduction limit for private sector employees good moves from Budget 2024?

NPS and EPF: Overlapping services

What is NPS Vatsalaya?

Latest NPS rules, news: In the Union Budget 2024 speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced two new initiatives with regard to National Pension Scheme (NPS) - extension of NPS 14% employer contribution benefits to private setcor and the intended launch of NPS Vatsalya.Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries, bringing it at par with the provisions available for government employees.Sriram Iyer, CEO, HDFC Pension Management told ET that with this move the “ground rules have been harmonised among government and non-government employees, which is a positive step.”Effectively, this means that now, private-sector employees can choose to reduce the taxable portion of employers’ contribution to their NPS corpus, thereby paying less tax and leaving greater funds in their pension deposits.“Employees will benefit from tax savings . More importantly, the 40% increase in contribution will have a significant impact on the terminal value of the retirement corpus,” remarked Iyer. The extended savings will “help in retirement planning, working as an option that is at par with the Provident Fund,” Dinesh Rohira, CEO & Founder, 5nance.com was quoted as saying.Moreover, the endeavour aims to increase NPS penetration by increasing tax incentives for the private sector, providing them a social security-cushion post-retirement.The scheme’s motive to widen the NPS subscriber base may not prove to be flawlessly effective, however. This is explained by Agrees Mrin Agarwal, Founder, Finsafe India: “While it’s good that the limit has been raised, it may not increase adoption as employees need to be educated in a big way. Also, the benefit is only for the salaried opting for the new tax regime,” she says.The mandatory contribution to the EPF, too, threatens to relegate the provisions of NPS under the umbrella of near-superfluity. This sentiment is echoed by Varun Sahay, a software engineer in a Delhi-based IT company: “When 12% of my salary is already deducted for the EPF, why should I put in more in the NPS and cut my take-home pay?”Rohira feels otherwise. “There’s no competition between the NPS and EPF as employees can contribute to both and build a 3-4 times bigger corpus while earning 3-4% higher returns via marketlinked options in the NPS,” he counters.Also Check | New Tax Regime 2023 vs 2024 After Budget: How Much Income Tax Will Salaried Taxpayers Save & How Do New Tax Slabs Compare To Old Regime? Top 10 Points You Must Know To jumpstart retirement savings for children, a new initiative called NPS Vatsalya has been unveiled in the Budget. This scheme allows parents and guardians to contribute to a minor's account, which can be converted into a regular NPS account once the child reaches adulthood.""It provides a very long duration for reaping the compounding benefits and accumulating a huge bounty at a later age. This can be a good way to plan a better future for kids who may not opt for a service segment in the future,"" says Rohira. Sriram Iyer agrees, stating, ""It’s a good move to help the child start his retirement journey. Even if a parent starts when the child is 10 years old, by the time he starts working, it can be a solid foundation for the compounding journey after that.""However, some experts question the utility of a product with such a long lock-in period, especially when parents cannot use the funds for essential goals like their child’s education amidst soaring education costs of 11-12%.""Parents are struggling to save for their own retirement, so it might be a bit of a stretch to expect them to save for their kids’ retirement. The need of the hour is a market-linked product that allows withdrawals only for the child’s education,"" says Mrin Agarwal, Founder of Finsafe India.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? Though the NPS permits partial withdrawals, it allows only 25% of the corpus after three years of joining, and this can be done only three times during the entire tenure. A premature exit before 60 years with 100% withdrawal is only possible if the corpus is less than Rs.2.5 lakh, an amount insufficient for most children's goals.""In its current form, there won’t be any uptake,"" asserts Agarwal. Rohira concurs, ""It’s a vanilla product with a lock-in, which does not make it very attractive and it may not take off. However, the government may optimise it and introduce new features later."" Iyer adds, ""This is just a start and there may be more subscriber-friendly features as we take it to the market. The regulator is proactive and open to feedback.""","Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries.

Gold import duty cut: Why Indians may not find buying gold from Dubai as attractive post Budget 2024,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-import-duty-cut-why-indians-may-not-find-buying-gold-from-dubai-as-attractive-post-budget-2024/articleshow/112097671.cms,"Gold import duty cut in Budget 2024: The recent reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai. Indian jewellers with stores in both India and the UAE believe that the narrowed duty differential will result in lower gold prices in India, making it less attractive for Indians to purchase gold in Dubai.The emirate had attracted gold-enthusiast Indians following a steep rise in customs duty in India in July 2022. In the fiscal 2024-25 budget, the duty on gold imports was more than halved.The duty cut is also expected to boost gold jewellery production in India, particularly the popular 'Kolkatti' jewellery from Kolkata, which is favored by Indian expats in Dubai and tourists from various countries. This move will encourage gold artisans to create new designs in both heavyweight and lightweight jewellery, attracting consumers to purchase gold from India.According to an ET report, Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group , estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India as Indian tourists who previously bought jewellery in Dubai will now prefer to shop in India. However, Indian expats living in Dubai and other customers may continue to buy from the UAE.Also Read | Gold losing sheen? Government cuts gold bond issuance target as investors look at better alternatives Rajiv Popley, director at Popley & Sons, believes that the perception of overseas gold being cheaper than in India is merely a mindset. He points out that the labour cost is significantly lower in India, and with the introduction of mandatory hallmarking and HUID numbers, the purity of gold in India is no longer a concern.Furthermore, NRIs in Dubai do not receive VAT refunds, and Indians travelling abroad only receive about 60% of the VAT back on their gold purchases. Gold trade analyst Bhargav Baidya suggests that the 1% duty differential between gold jewellery in India and Dubai will be offset by Indian jewellers offering discounts to retain and attract customers.Saurabh Gadgil, chairman of PNG Jewellers, notes that Indian import duty is now on par with the US, allowing Indian jewellers to offer competitive prices compared to other countries worldwide. The reduced customs duty is expected to make gold purchases in India more attractive and convenient for Indian consumers, potentially leading to a significant shift in their gold shopping preferences.",The reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai.

Gold losing sheen? The government has reduced its target for issuing gold bonds in the financial year 2024-25 by 38% compared to the previous interim budget goal, according to a senior official. The revised target stands at Rs 18,500 crore, down from Rs 29,638 crore estimated in the interim budget and Rs 26,852 crore (revised estimate) in 2023-24.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told ET ""The decision followed a reassessment of various factors, including investor demand, other investment products and uncertainties around the global economy, as the situation has changed since the interim budget in February.""After accounting for redemptions, the net issuances of sovereign gold bonds are now estimated at Rs 15,000 crore for this fiscal year, a significant decrease from the Rs 26,138 crore projected in the interim budget and Rs 25,352 crore in the revised estimate for 2023-24.Harish Galipelli, director at ILA Commodities India, attributed this shift to retail investors increasingly opting for equities in anticipation of better returns. He also noted that people are uncertain about the potential for further increases in gold prices in the short-to-medium term following a recent rally. Additionally, Galipelli pointed out that savings in rural areas have been impacted by retail inflation and other factors.The gold bond and gold monetisation schemes were introduced by the government in late 2015 to discourage the physical purchase of precious metals and reduce imports, thereby mitigating the negative impact on the current account deficit.The gross collection through these two schemes is now projected to be Rs 20,030 crore in 2024-25, compared to Rs 31,168 crore in the interim budget and Rs 28,240 crore (revised estimate) in the previous fiscal year. Similarly, the net collection is estimated at Rs 16,433 crore, down from Rs 27,571 crore in the interim budget and Rs 26,653 crore in the previous year.

Both schemes were designed to curb gold imports, which, along with crude oil, have been significant contributors to India's current account deficit.

Byju’s auditor BDO resigns; cites inadequate support from management,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/byjus-auditor-bdo-resigns-cites-inadequate-support-from-management/articleshow/113147566.cms,"MUMBAI: Troubled edtech startup Byju’s auditor BDO (MSKA & Associates) has resigned, adding to the series of setbacks for the firm which faces insolvency proceedings after the Supreme Court set aside a ruling of the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) that approved settlement of dispute between Byju’s and the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).This is the second time that the auditor of the company has resigned. In June last year, Byju’s auditor Deloitte had resigned citing lack of communication on the status of the audit readiness of its FY22 results. Byju’s which published its FY22 results after a prolonged delay revealed losses of over Rs 8,000 crore and is yet to file its FY23 results.In a letter to the company’s board of directors who are now under suspension due to the insolvency proceedings, BDO also cited a similar lack of communication on the part of the firm’s management. BDO said that there has been inadequate support from the management of the company in providing books of account, information and explanations sought by the audit firm and sufficient appropriate audit evidence to enable them complete the audit for FY 2022-23. “We would also like to highlight that on a few occasions certain information had not been provided to us for our consideration and evaluation, which were critical for the purposes of our audit and were only shared with us later after being repeatedly requested. For instance, the notice received from the shareholders for conducting an EGM was not shared with the audit team by the management when the notice was received by the Company in December 2023, notice for initiating insolvency proceedings against the company be certain vendors, notices received from certain statutory authorities, etc. which were received prior to the completion of audit for the year ended March 2022, were shared with the audit team after the completion of audit for the said year. We have therefore reason to believe that the management of the Company lacks transparency with respect to providing full information to the auditor for their consideration and evaluation,” BDO said in the letter reviewed by TOI. BDO could not be reached for a comment.BDO also said that there has been an inordinate delay on the part of Byju’s management to initiate the forensic review of transactions the company had with Dubai based More Ideas General Trading. “Due to the ongoing litigation with the lenders, we are given to understand by the management that the Company has lost control over certain of its subsidiaries and the management would not have access to the books of account of these subsidiaries. This would further hamper the ability of the Company to be able to complete the preparation of its consolidated financial statements,” BDO added.In a statement on Saturday, Byju’s while confirming BDO’s resignation said that the auditor made unethical requests and failed to adhere to proper procedures. “The real reason for BDO’s resignation is Byju’s firm refusal to backdate its reports, while BDO went to the extent of recommending a firm that could facilitate such an illegal activity. Multiple call recordings exist, where BDO representatives explicitly suggest backdating these documents, which Byju’s refused to do. Byju’s strongly believes that this is the main reason for their resignation,” the startup alleged.Byju’s also said that on July 17, a day after the NLCT ordered initiation of insolvency proceedings against the company, BDO sent an email to the suspended board of the company, seeking certain clarification regarding historical transactions that the firm had undertaken with a partner based in the Middle East and in the same email, BDO threatened to resign if they do not receive the requested clarifications within 45 days. “…during the first meeting of the Committee of Creditors held on 3rd of September 2024, the IRP explicitly noted that he had repeatedly reached out to BDO for clarification during the last 45 days but had received no response. BDO’s lack of communication with the IRP (interim resolution professional) is surprising and suspicious,” Byju’s said, adding that it welcomes the RP taking the lead in conducting a forensic audit into this specific matter.Once valued at $22 billion, Byju’s today is battling several litigations, has laid off thousands of employees and is staring at an existential crisis.","This is the second time that the auditor of the company has resigned.

The grassroots organization Hindus for America First has announced its endorsement of Republican candidate Donald Trump . In a bold move that could shift dynamics in the upcoming presidential race, the group also revealed plans to launch a campaign against Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris in pivotal battleground states, including Pennsylvania, Georgia, and North Carolina.At a press conference on Thursday, Utsav Sanduja, chairman and founder of Hindus for America First, voiced strong concerns about Harris's potential presidency. Sanduja warned that Harris could destabilize Indo-US relations. ""If Kamala becomes the president, she might appoint liberal judges who could overturn critical Supreme Court decisions affecting Asian-American voters,"" he said.Sanduja also criticized the Biden-Harris administration’s handling of border security. ""Under their watch, we've seen a surge in illegal immigration, leading to unprecedented crime rates and drug smuggling, which particularly impacts minority communities, including many Asian-American business owners,"" he asserted.In contrast, Sanduja praised Trump for his pro-India stance. He highlighted Trump’s efforts to foster a merit-based immigration system and strengthen defense and technology ties with India. ""Trump has been very supportive of India.

ADB to allocate half of its lending to climate finance by 2030,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/adb-to-allocate-half-of-its-lending-to-climate-finance-by-2030/articleshow/113143075.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Asian Development Bank on Friday announced a new target to allocate half of its annual lendings to climate finance by 2030. Additionally, the bank also aims to increase private sector capital mobilization as a strategy update for the remaining decade.The bank said that the new target would be a big leap from the present ambition of 35 per cent and comes with an aim of $100 billion contribution to climate finance between 2019 and 2030, as only $30 billion have been contributed so far.In an interview with news agency Reuters, ADB strategy director Tomoyuki Kimura said, ""We want to be the climate change bank in the region.""Kimura said that under ADB’s strategy 2030 mid term review, it would focus on tackling five of Asia’s key development issues: climate change, developing robust private sectors, cooperating on public goods such as healthcare, digital transformation and making vulnerable communities more resilient.Planning its expansion in the private sector development, ADB targets to invest $13 billion to finance private sector projects from 2019 to 2030, which is thrice the current amount of $3.7 billion for that period. The target would be achieved with ADB's own private-sector lending and funds from partner institutions and other lenders, said Kimura.It includes a minimum of $4.5 billion in direct private capital mobilization, a major jump from the $1.4 billion since 2019. The lender is working with new types of private sector partners, including investment funds, philanthropies and other institutions.He added that ADB is now looking forward to deploying the additional lending headroom amid strong demand from client countries. However, constraints to lending volume need to be addressed, including improving the preparation of projects for loan approval.ADB president Masatsugu Asakawa stated, ""Cascading shocks have derailed years of development progress in Asia and the Pacific.""He added that ADB is updating its vision, focusing on its financial capacity and modernizing its operational approach to help its members respond to these unprecedented challenges.The news of the new target comes almost a year after ADB permitted reforms to unlock $100 billion in new financing capacity over a decade, meeting a mandate from US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen for the World Bank and other development banks to expand lending for climate change and other global crises.",The Asian Development Bank has announced a new target to allocate half of its annual lendings to climate finance by 2030.

US stock market faces worst week in nearly 18 months following weak jobs data report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-stock-market-faces-worst-week-since-march-2023-following-weak-jobs-data-report/articleshow/113142349.cms,"US stock market on Friday registered one of its worst performances, with technology stocks taking the hardest hit followed by a US job market report that came in weaker than expected, adding to concerns about the economy. The decline was largely attributed to weak performance of some large tech stocks that had been benefiting from the AI boom.The S&P 500 declined 1.7% or 94.99 points to close at 5,408.42 marking its worst week since March 2023, while the Nasdaq fell 2.6% or 436.83 points, settling at 16,690.83, led by tech companies like Broadcom and Nvidia.The Dow Jones Industrial Average also shed 410 points (1%) after initially gaining 250 points in the morning, ending at 40,345.41.However, despite the market's turbulent week, the S&P 500 remains just 4.6% below its record high set in July and is still up 13.4% for 2024 so far, which is considered a good performance.The jobs report, considered the most important of the year, showed that US employers hired fewer workers in August than economists had predicted, marking the second consecutive month of lower-than-expected hiring. This data, along with recent reports indicating weakness in manufacturing and other economic sectors, has raised questions about the extent to which the Federal Reserve will cut its main interest rate at its upcoming meeting.Meanwhile, the report also contained some positive indicators as the unemployment rate decreased from 4.3% to 4.2%, and August's job growth, although weaker than anticipated, surpassed July's figures.The Federal Reserve has been working to curb high inflation by maintaining the federal funds rate at a two-decade high for over a year. However, the central bank is now expected to shift its focus towards protecting the job market and preventing a recession.While interest rate cuts can boost investment prices, there are concerns on Wall Street that the Fed may be acting too late. If a recession does occur, it would negatively impact corporate profits and negate the benefits of lower rates.""All is not well with the labor market,"" said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. ""The Fed wanted the labor market to come into better balance, but any balancing act is unstable.""Federal Reserve board member Christopher Waller highlighted the importance of being data-driven without overreacting to individual data points. He expressed his belief that the economy is not currently in a recession or necessarily heading towards one in the near future. Waller acknowledged the cooling labor market and suggested that a series of rate reductions may be appropriate, given that slowing job growth now appears to be a more significant concern than high inflation. However, he noted that the specific pace and extent of these cuts remain undetermined.Broadcom declined 10.4% despite surpassing analysts' expectations for profit and revenue in the recent quarter, partially attributed to AI. The company's projected revenue of $14 billion for the current quarter fell slightly short of analysts' forecasts of $14.11 billion, according to FactSet. Consequently, Broadcom's stock suffered a substantial weekly drop of 15.9%.Additionally, other chip companies, including Nvidia, also fell on Friday, with Nvidia's stock falling by 4.1%. Following a surge earlier in the year due to increased revenue driven by the AI frenzy, Nvidia's stock has been volatile since mid-July as investors reassess its valuation. Given its substantial market influence, Nvidia's stock significantly impacts Wall Street, and it recorded a weekly decline of 13.9% despite consistently exceeding analysts' growth expectations.On the positive side, US Steel experienced a 4.3% increase after the CEO of competitor Cleveland Cliffs expressed interest in acquiring US Steel during an MSNBC interview, even if the White House were to block the proposed sale to Japan's Nippon Steel.Additionally, the bond market witnessed sharp swings as well, with Treasury yields fluctuating throughout the day following the release of the jobs report.The two-year Treasury yield initially dropped to 3.64% following the release of the jobs report, before quickly rebounding above 3.76%. It then fell back to 3.66% after Waller's comments, down from 3.74% at the close of the previous day.","The S&P 500 declined 1.7% or 94.99 points to close at 5,408.42 marking its worst week since March 2023.

US job growth comes up short in possible warning sign for Fed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-job-growth-for-august-federal-reserve-us-rate-cut/articleshow/113131548.cms,"“The slight improvement in the unemployment rate suggests things have improved, but large downward revisions to July data and the disappointing NFP print — even when adjusted for the estimated overstatement — means jobs creation was probably flat in July, and barely positive in August. Powell may not be able to convince other Fed officials to vote for jumbo rate cut after this print.” Bloomberg economists led by Anna Wong

US hiring fell short of forecasts in August after downward revisions to the prior two months, a development likely to fuel ongoing debate over how much the Federal Reserve should cut interest rates.Nonfarm payrolls rose by 142,000 last month, leaving the three-month average at the lowest since mid-2020, Bureau of Labor Statistics data showed Friday.The unemployment rate edged down to 4.2%, the first decline in five months, reflecting a reversal in temporary layoffs.The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of forecasters called for 165,000. Bloomberg Economics predicted 145,000.Treasury yields fluctuated as traders boosted bets that Fed officials could reduce interest rates by a half percentage point at their upcoming meeting to guard against sustained weakness in hiring. The S&P 500 index opened higher and the dollar was little changed.“The labor market is clearly softening, and the Fed needs to step in to cut off tail risks,” Sonu Varghese, a global macro strategist at Carson Group, said in a note after the release. “The report seals the deal for a September rate cut , but the big question really is whether the Fed goes big.”Other reports suggest the job market is losing steam. While layoffs remain largely subdued, many companies are putting off expansion plans amid high borrowing costs and uncertainty ahead of the November presidential election. A Fed survey of regional businesses published Wednesday indicated employers have become more selective in hiring in recent weeks, with some cutting hours and leaving open positions unfilled.Hiring was weighed down by job losses in the manufacturing, retail trade and information sectors. The education and health care sector — one of the biggest drivers of hiring in the post-pandemic period — boosted headcount by the least since 2022.Total private-sector payrolls rose by 96,000 on average over the last three months, marking the first time that number fell below 100,000 since the onset of the pandemic.While the overall unemployment rate edged lower, the so-called underemployment rate — which includes those working part-time for economic reasons and discouraged workers — rose to 7.9%, the highest since October 2021.The participation rate — the share of the population that is working or looking for work — was unchanged at 62.7%. The rate for workers ages 25-54, also known as prime-age workers, edged lower for the first time since March.Fed officials also pay close attention to wage growth, as it can help inform expectations for consumer spending — the main engine of the economy. Average hourly earnings rose 3.8% from a year ago. Wages for production and nonsupervisory employees, which covers the majority of workers, advanced 4.1%.In prepared remarks published after the release of the jobs numbers, New York Fed President John Williams said it is now appropriate for the central bank to reduce interest rates, given progress on lowering inflation and a cooling in the labor market. Fed Governor Christopher Waller and Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee are scheduled to speak later Friday.“There are two roads they could take: Steady 25-basis-point cuts with a commitment to do more if the labor market shows signs of additional cooling — which it did today — or you go in with larger increments and try and downplay the negative signal,” said Laura Rosner-Warburton, a partner at MacroPolicy Perspectives.“There are two paths. We feel on the fence with this report. It leans toward 50,” she said.","Nonfarm payrolls rose by 142,000 last month, leaving the three-month average at the lowest since mid-2020. The unemployment rate edged down to 4.2%, the first decline in five months.
