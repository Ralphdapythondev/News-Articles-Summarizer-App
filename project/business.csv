(AI image)

Is it ‘Buy China, Sell India’ now? In the past two years, investors in emerging markets who followed the ""Buy India, Sell China"" strategy have made significant profits. However, they are now starting to reverse their positions in response to Beijing's massive stimulus package aimed at reviving the economy and markets.The Chinese stock market has experienced a remarkable resurgence, with the CSI300 index surging 25% in a single week and the Hang Seng index gaining 16%.In contrast, the Nifty and Sensex indices in India have been under selling pressure, with foreign institutional investors (FIIs) withdrawing more than a billion dollars in a single day's trade, resulting in a nearly 1,300-point drop in the Sensex.China has taken steps to boost liquidity and stimulate consumption demand by reducing the reserve ratio for banks and lowering the mortgage rate for existing housing by 50 basis points each. The People's Bank of China has also indicated that it will implement policy easing in the near future.Institutional investors are concerned about peak valuations in the Indian market, which has been driven by retail investor liquidity. Meanwhile, FIIs have compelling reasons to invest in the Chinese resurgence story, including a large stimulus package, attractive valuations, and an underweight stance, according to an ET report.Joanne Siew Chin of DBS Group was quoted as saying, ""India has performed strongly and we are looking at other markets. China and ASEAN could actually outperform. India is actually quite a domestic liquidity market.""The Singaporean financial services firm believes that China will outperform India for the remainder of 2024, following the government's announcement of a range of monetary and liquidity measures and its commitment to further fiscal support.According to Chetan Seth of Nomura, ""Feedback from investors, and assessing some market indicators suggest that, this time around, the rally might be more sustainable relative to previous start-stop rallies. As we noted in the past, investors have been underweight HK/China stocks, and this may cause many of them to chase stocks to neutralise those positions. We suspect that many of the China bulls will likely also emerge from the long winter hibernation.""Recently, India's weight in the MSCI AC World Investable Market Index surpassed that of China, providing FIIs with sufficient room to reallocate their investments. The low valuations of Chinese stocks are also contributing to the ongoing momentum.Dr. V K Vijayakumar of Geojit believes that this could be a tactical trade that may continue for some time, with FIIs potentially selling in India and shifting more funds to better-performing markets. However, he notes that FII selling is unlikely to have a significant impact on the Indian market, as massive domestic investments can easily absorb the sales.Kotak Institutional Equities analysts observed that FII inflows in India have been primarily passive and that active FIIs may consider deploying additional inflows into China.However, they doubt that active FPIs will sell a substantial portion of their holdings in India to invest in China. The analysts also noted that any change in the relative weights of the two countries in various benchmark indices will only affect incremental flows from Global Emerging Markets (GEM) ETF funds.","Investors in emerging markets who followed the ""Buy India, Sell China"" strategy have made significant profits.

Good news for freshers! Indian IT sector entry-level hiring set to double in FY25,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/good-news-for-freshers-indian-it-sector-entry-level-hiring-set-to-double-in-fy25/articleshow/113842030.cms,"<p>The Indian IT industry experienced a turning point in the June quarter, with several companies reporting net headcount additions. (AI image) <br></p>

IT Sector Hiring Outlook

Indian IT sector to see hiring revival: The IT services sector is poised for a significant resurgence in fresher hiring this year, with estimates suggesting a nearly twofold increase in entry-level recruitment compared to the previous fiscal year. Data obtained by ET indicates that the sector is expected to exceed 150,000 fresher hires in FY25.Experts attribute this positive outlook to the growing demand in business, especially in the banking, financial services, and insurance (BFSI) segment, which represents the largest vertical for most IT companies.Additionally, substantial large deal wins and global expansion by major IT players contribute to this optimism.The Indian IT industry experienced a turning point in the June quarter, with several companies reporting net headcount additions after a period of decline.This increase in fresher hiring comes after a subdued FY24, during which clients reduced their technology spending. IT companies have also been expanding their operations beyond their primary geographies to mitigate risks. Recent months have shown signs of recovery in core regions, especially with interest rate cuts by central banks in Europe and the US.""FY2024 saw the lowest intake of freshers in the IT sector since 2000. However, FY2025 is expected to witness a significant rebound, with a potential 100% year-on-year (YoY) growth, surpassing 150,000 entry-level hires,"" said Kapil Joshi, Deputy CEO at Quess IT Staffing. This contrasts with the roughly 60,000 net hires reported by the $250 billion technology services industry in FY24.Aditya Narayan Mishra, MD & CEO of staffing firm CIEL HR, notes, ""Fresher hiring demand is projected to rise by 10-15% in the second half of FY25 compared to the same period last year. This growth is primarily driven by a reduction in bench strength and an optimistic industry outlook for the coming months."" CIEL HR estimates suggest that Indian IT services firms have already hired around 150,000-170,000 freshers in the calendar year 2024.Mishra further commented, ""This reflects a cautious yet strategic hiring approach amid economic uncertainties. Compared to the same period last year, there has been an estimated 10% increase in fresher hiring, signaling a gradual recovery in the sector. Organisations are taking a balanced recruitment approach, aligning fresher intake with project demands while maintaining a prudent outlook on overall growth.""Also Read | Infosys ‘Power’ programme offering freshers Rs 9 lakh salary; substantially higher than Rs 3-3.5 lakh entry-level fresher pay Accenture , the global IT leader, reported a significant increase in headcount during the June-August quarter, with 24,000 new hires, the highest in the past ten quarters. The company's Chair and CEO, Julie Sweet, emphasized that the majority of the hiring is taking place in India, particularly in the technology sector, and includes onboarding new college graduates to refresh their talent pyramid.A report by Nuvama suggests that most companies expanded their workforce in Q1 FY25 and are now focusing on optimizing their talent pyramid. They are preparing to onboard freshers hired in the previous quarters, and this deployment is expected to contribute to future growth. Notably, Infosys has sent onboarding emails to more than 1,000 engineering graduates who had been waiting for placement for over two years.In Q1, Infosys and Wipro announced plans to resume campus hiring this fiscal year after a one-year hiatus. TCS , the industry leader, has committed to hiring 40,000 freshers in FY25, while the top four IT players, including HCLTech , have collectively pledged to hire around 82,000 freshers.Recent reports indicate that these four IT companies signed at least 33 deals in July and August, necessitating the need for talent to execute the projects.","The Indian IT industry experienced a turning point in the June quarter, with several companies reporting net headcount additions.

"Employees take note! Should you be worried about new TDS deposit rules for employers effective from October 1, 2024?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/employees-take-note-should-you-be-worried-about-new-tds-deposit-rules-for-employers-effective-from-october-1-2024/articleshow/113847170.cms,"Employees may be concerned that the relaxation in TDS compliance granted to companies. (AI image)

What are the new TDS Deposit Rules?

New TDS Deposit Rules Explained with Example

Should employees be worried?

New TDS Deposit Rules : The government has eased the regulations surrounding the time frame within which companies or deductors must deposit TDS (deducted from payments made by them) with the government before a prosecution notice is issued. The standard due date for depositing TDS with the government is the 7th of the month following the month in which it is deducted.Employees may be concerned that the relaxation in TDS compliance granted to companies could affect the timely deposit of the tax against their respective PANs.According to an ET report, there have been recent instances of companies, such as SpiceJet and Byju's, not depositing TDS with the government on time, resulting in employees encountering income tax issues.Previously, companies had 60 days from the original due date to deposit the outstanding TDS (tax deducted at source). However, starting from October 1, 2024, the new income tax laws provide companies with additional time to accomplish this.From October 1 onwards, companies will have until the deadline to file the TDS return to deposit TDS with the government. Nevertheless, if the TDS is deposited after the original due date, penal interest would have to be paid in addition.Also Read | New TDS rates from October 1, 2024: What are the revised tax deducted at source rates? Check list of changes for these transactions This effectively grants an extra 20 days to make the TDS deposit, i.e., 60 days from the original due date plus an additional 20 days.The income tax department has introduced a new rule regarding the prosecution notice for companies that fail to deposit the TDS by the due date for filing the TDS return.Previously, the notice would be sent after 60 days from the due date for depositing the TDS. However, under the new TDS laws, the notice will be sent immediately if the company fails to deposit the TDS, along with the penal interest, by the TDS return filing deadline. This change applies only if the TDS amount exceeds Rs 25 lakh.To illustrate this change, consider a scenario where a company deducts tax from an employee's April salary. The last date to deposit the tax deducted in April is May 7, and the last date to file the TDS return for the tax deducted in April, May, and June is July 31. Under the earlier laws, if the company failed to deposit the tax deducted by July 7 (60 days from the due date of May 7), the income tax department would send a notice asking why the company should not be prosecuted.With the new TDS laws, the income tax department will send the prosecution notice if the company fails to deposit the TDS, along with the penal interest, by July 31, the TDS return filing deadline.According to the income tax laws, the tax deductor must deposit the TDS dues on or before the seventh of the subsequent month, with an exception in April. For government employees, the March TDS is deposited on or before April 7, while for others, it is April 30.Also Read | Latest post office small savings schemes interest rates Oct-Dec 2024: Government announces rates for PPF, SSY, SCSS, NSC - check list The recent amendments to the TDS laws provide companies with additional time to deposit the TDS with the government. However, concerns have been raised about the potential negative impact on employees.Many employees do not regularly review their Form 26AS and Annual Information Statement ( AIS ) during the financial year to verify if their employer has deposited the tax deducted from their salary against their PAN.Typically, employees check their Form 26AS and AIS in the following year while filing their income tax returns. When employers fail to deposit the TDS, employees are often surprised when they review their Form 26AS and AIS.Media reports have highlighted instances where employees of Byju's received tax notices from the income tax department regarding unpaid TDS dues. Recently, SpiceJet acknowledged that TDS dues remained unpaid between April 2020 and August 2023.Pranay Bhatia, Partner & Leader, Corporate Tax, Tax & Regulatory Services, BDO India, was quoted as saying by ET, ""The new TDS laws provide extra time for companies to deposit TDS dues with the government. While this relaxation will help companies, it will not adversely affect the employees' TDS credit. The income tax department can still send the prosecution notice to the companies if they fail to deposit the tax deducted on or before the due date to file TDS return statement.""Naveen Wadhwa, Vice President of Research and Advisory Division, Taxmann, adds, ""The relaxation of TDS laws from October 1, 2024, offers companies extra time to deposit TDS along with the penal interest before the prosecution notice is sent. However, the new TDS laws will not adversely impact employees' TDS credit against their PAN.""Recent reports have highlighted instances where employers have withheld TDS from their employees' salaries but failed to remit the funds to the government. As a result, numerous employees faced difficulties in claiming TDS credit when submitting their income tax returns.According to Wadhwa, ""Section 205 of the Income-tax Act prohibits tax recovery from taxpayers, provided tax is deducted from their salary or any other income but not deposited with the tax department. However, taxpayers must provide proof to the income tax department that tax has been deducted from their salary.""By furnishing evidence of TDS deductions, individuals can ensure they receive the appropriate TDS credit and prevent any additional tax liabilities.","The government has eased the regulations surrounding the time frame within which companies or deductors must deposit TDS (deducted from payments made by them) The standard due date for depositing TDS with the government is the 7th of the month following the month in which it is deducted. From October 1 onwards, companies will have until the deadline to file the TDS return to deposit T DS.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113848173,imgsize-50376,width-400,resizemode-4/113848173.jpg"

Sebi's new F&O rules make entry tougher,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sebis-new-fo-rules-make-entry-tougher/articleshow/113863808.cms,"MUMBAI: Sebi has made it tougher for individuals to participate in equity derivatives trading by raising the entry barrier in terms of contract size , and requiring upfront fees and costlier roll-overs.Under the new regulations, option buyers must pay premiums upfront, replacing the practice where brokers were allowed to provide collateral. Sebi has also done away with the special pricing on expiring contracts that enabled traders to take larger positions.Both practices, which allowed investors to sell an expiring option and buy a longer-term one with lower margins, will take effect from Feb 1, 2025.Noting that the current stipulation that index derivatives must have a contract value between Rs 5-10 lakh was set in 2015, Sebi said that derivatives contracts henceforth shall have a value between Rs 15 lakh to Rs 20 lakh. The lot size will also be adjusted so that the contract value stays within the new bracket during reviews.Sebi will monitor position limits throughout the day instead of only at the end to control the high trading activity, especially on expiry days. Exchanges will limit weekly expiries to one index per week, simplifying the current practice of multiple expiries.Speaking to TOI, Dhirendra Kumar, CEO of Value Research, said, ""Unlike equity, which by definition has to generate a better return than fixed income over time, derivatives are a zero-sum game, and it is almost always the individual investor who loses. Sebi should introduce a statutory warning illustrating the risk of losses, just like with cigarettes."" He added that while in equity, the risks are of price volatility and the failure of individual companies - which can be addressed by long-term investing and diversification - derivatives are an unnecessary risk for individuals.

Boeing weighs raising at least $10 billion selling stock,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/boeing-weighs-raising-at-least-10-billion-selling-stock/articleshow/113860184.cms,"Suspended talks

‘Perfectly Comfortable’

Boeing Co. is considering raising at least $10 billion by selling new stock, as the planemaker seeks to replenish cash reserves depleted further by an ongoing strike , according to people familiar with the discussions.The company is working with advisers to explore its options, said the people, asking not to be identified discussing confidential matters. Raising equity isn’t likely to happen for at least a month, assuming the planemaker can resolve the strike, because Boeing wants a firm grasp of the financial toll from the walkout by 33,000 workers, the people said.A spokesman for Boeing declined to comment.No final decision on timing and the amount has been made, and Boeing could end up deciding against the move, the people said.Boeing is under pressure to shore up its finances and hold onto its investment-grade credit rating. The company is one step away from dropping into speculative territory, which would further drive up the cost to service its $58 billion debt load. The situation has been exacerbated by the strike now in its third week that has shut down output of Boeing’s single-aisle airliner, as each day of stoppage further dents reserves.The US planemaker has seen its financial reserves dwindle in the wake of a near-catastrophic accident in January that forced Boeing to slow production of its cash-cow 737 Max airliner. Should Boeing proceed, a sale of that magnitude would stand to be the biggest by a public company since Saudi Arabian Oil Co.’s $12.3 billion sale in June.The stock fell 1% as of 9:45 a.m. in New York as investors weighed the effect of a potential share sale. Through Monday, the planemaker had lost 42% this year, lowering its value to $93.6 billion — and putting Boeing on course for its worst annual return since the financial crisis in 2008.While a potential sale may dilute stock owners, the extra funds would help the company maintain its investment grade credit rating, said Rob Stallard, an analyst with Vertical Research Partners. He said the equity raise could reach as high as $15 billion.Boeing faces a liquidity squeeze after burning through $8.25 billion in free cash during the first half. The US planemaker slowed work on its cash-cow 737 Max and other jets to address quality lapses brought to light by the accident on an aircraft on Jan. 5. Workers have rebuffed two offers from the company for higher pay, and the two sides have engaged a mediator to help overcome the impasse.Analysts expect Boeing to suffer a $3.36 billion cash outflow in the third quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The strike stands to cost the company about $1.5 billion for each month that workers stay off the job, according to estimates by JPMorgan Chase & Co.The outflows risk lowering Boeing’s cash balance to the point where the three major ratings agencies would be compelled to act. Fitch Ratings has warned that an extended strike could have a “meaningful operational and financial impact, increasing the risk of a downgrade.”Chief Financial Officer Brian West told analysts at a Morgan Stanley conference last month that Boeing “will take any necessary actions” to preserve its investment grade rating and repair its balance sheet. Boeing has already initiated a savings plan that includes furloughs for workers, a hiring freeze as well as a pay cut for executives.“We are perfectly comfortable to supplement our liquidity position to support those two objectives,” West said when asked if the company might need to raise debt or equity.While Boeing is currently cash-strapped, the company is pointing to an order backlog of 5,490 aircraft, representing about half a trillion dollars worth of revenue. The 737 Max is largely sold out until the end of the decade, and European arch-rival Airbus SE is also struggling to ramp up production and has been unable to meaningfully capitalize on Boeing’s woes.The US planemaker has a history of tapping markets shortly after it releases quarterly earnings, and the next such report is slated for late October. The company most recently issued $10 billion of bonds at the end of April, about a week after it published its first-quarter results.The company has also said it wants to buy back Spirit AeroSystems Inc., the troubled supplier at the heart of some of its current manufacturing woes. While Boeing plans to pay for the $4.7 billion transaction in stock, the reintegration of its most important supplier will require additional investments to turn the business around.","Boeing is under pressure to shore up its finances and hold onto its investment- grade credit rating.

Railway Budget 2024 : The government has wavered little in its efforts to spur a modernisation of railways in the country, pivoting on technology, to support the country’s economic ambitions. In line with expectations, Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore, marking yet another year of successive increase in outlay.That takes forward the past policies and the government’s vision, which have paved the way for modernisation of the transport behemoth.In earlier decades, the government had focused on laying tracks on new routes, electrification and incremental rolling stock capacity addition. That was the need of the hour back then and has helped set up the base for a larger transformation.For instance, the massive Dedicated Freight Corridor ( DFC ) as well as locomotive factories at Marhaura and Madhepura in Bihar were conceptualised over a decade ago and we are seeing their completion now.More recently, the focus has shifted to modernisation—of rolling stock and safety systems, among other aspects.This year, emphasis has also been laid on the railways’ crucial role in industrial development. Commodity-specific corridors have been planned in eastern India and impetus given to port connectivity. Vande Bharat and technology-led upgrades in rolling stock remain in focus. Safety has been prioritised through budgetary allocations for the anti-collision systemKavach . That said, there are other cogs in the wheel that demand attention from a long-term perspective.First, the target for the Operating Ratio, the crucial efficiency gauge, has been set at 98.22% for 2024-25, compared with 98.65% in 2023-24. This reflects an imminent need for operational transformation. An effective overhaul of the world’s fourth-largest rail network will take many years and thus we need to start focusing on improving efficiency and reducing costs now.DFC is almost entirely operational and will be complete over the next few months. To ensure the project achieves its twin goals of reducing logistics costs and enhancing freight efficiency, railways need to attract more cargo on the corridor. This will help increase the rail coefficient and make the railways’ approach more market-oriented, which will in turn aid future corridors.A revamp of railway stations is on track, with sufficient funds dedicated to this end. But even though new coaches and wagons are increasingly being added to meet footfalls, the stations and passenger trains themselves remain synonymous with chaos.Just as safety, comfort and convenience have been prioritised, there is a need for solutions to address the capacity and demand challenges. As a first step, the government could target development of new stations and setting up of new coach production units.As a leading freight mover, Indian Railways carried a record 1,588 MT cargo in fiscal 2024, up from 1,095 MT in fiscal 2015. It accounts for 26% of the cargo moved in the country—by no means an easy feat. The railways aims to take this volume to 3,000 MT by 2030, which would require a 11% CAGR against the around 4.2% witnessed over the last 10 years. As per a report by TERI and Shakti Foundation, from carrying about 62% of freight traffic in 1990-91, Indian Railways’ share has declined to ~27% in 2014-15. This has been due to the expanding road network, cost competitiveness over railways, and door-to-door service. Thus, commencing the cycle of increasing the rail share again is commendable.DFCs, a high-capacity track network, high-power locomotives and improvement in wagon designs have set the ball rolling for larger capacity, faster freight trains that deliver better efficiency.Yet, achieving exponential growth is a tall ask given the current dynamics. Possibly, similar challenges might apply to other goals the railways might have for 2047.To be fair, despite its scale and complexity, Indian Railways has been able to achieve diverse developments at commendable speed.But the track ahead is long and it is time to start discussing the reinvention of the institutional set-up.Indian Railways sees substantial private sector involvement in the form of vendors and contractors. Policymakers could start mulling extreme options such as parallel privately-owned and operated railway infrastructure, coupled with centralised planning and an evolved role for the railways. This will need a robust policy framework from the Government of India.The time is perhaps also ripe to bring user charge and asset monetisation-driven segments for passengers as well as cargo to the discussion table. Globally, the separation of infrastructure and operations in railways has delivered mixed results, for example in the United Kingdom. The model should be analysed and revisited to understand its potential relevance in the Indian context.The key would be to retrace our steps and align our long-term goals to identify not just incremental changes but also ways to explore bold and path-breaking alternatives that put Indian Railways on a smooth track and bring it up to speed.","Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore.

Gradual Change in LTCG Regime?

Budget 2024 capital gains tax changes: The Narendra Modi government is considering suggestions for tweaks in the new long term capital gains tax regime that was announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman in Union Budget 2024.The July 23 budget reduced the LTCG tax on property from 20% to 12.5%. The indexation benefit, which allowed taxpayers to adjust the acquisition cost for inflation before calculating capital gains and thus reduce their tax liability, is proposed to be eliminated for properties purchased on or after April 1, 2001.The government publishes the Cost Inflation Index (CII) annually for this calculation.India Inc is appealing to the government for a gradual shift to the long-term capital gains tax regime proposed in the FY25 budget, which aims to eliminate indexation benefits for property, gold, and other unlisted assets.According to an ET report by Deepshikha Sikarwar, the industry is suggesting alternatives such as a higher tax rate with indexation or a lower rate of 12.5% without indexation, as well as some form of grandfathering for ancestral properties.The finance ministry is currently reviewing these proposals and will discuss them with the Prime Minister's Office. The final decision will be made closer to the date when the Finance Bill reply is to be presented in Parliament, the reports said.Industry groups are expected to submit formal proposals to the finance ministry in the near future.

Budget 2024 for manufacturing sector : The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth. While the middle class has been offered tax relief, the government's primary focus remains on judicious spending to maximize economic impact. The budget's core themes are employment, skilling, MSME development, and support for the middle class.Largely focus has remained intact on spending money judiciously to ensure that each penny spent creates a ripple effect in the entire economic landscape.Although at first glance, manufacturing might appear to have taken a backseat, a deeper analysis reveals a multifaceted approach to bolstering the sector. Initiatives like employment-linked benefits and internship programs, while primarily aimed at job creation and skill development, indirectly benefit manufacturing companies by expanding the talent pool.Extensive focus on the MSME manufacturing units by way of extending term loan facility for purchase of machinery and equipment without collateral or third-party guarantee, would help companies in augmenting their capital base/ capacity and strengthen the very foundation of the manufacturing ecosystem in the country. Development of a new credit-assessment model by Public Sector Banks to assess MSME credit shall provide much needed regulatory relief to the units.With respect to the large manufacturing entities, while there is no direct fiscal/ tax incentive introduced in this budget, some support has been provided with an extensive focus on development of ‘industrial parks’ in nearly 100 cities under the ‘plug and play’ model. Reforms proposed with respect to land administration, planning and management, shall also ease out acquisition related difficulties often faced by entrepreneurs/ business houses in acquiring lands for manufacturing set-ups.Targeted Customs duty interventions like, rationalization of Customs duty provisions in Mobile phone manufacturing setups, extension of Customs duty exemption on import of capital goods for manufacturing of solar cells and panels, full Customs duty exemption on import of 25 critical minerals,, shall provide the required impetus for enhancing domestic manufacturing environment.Governments’ focus on formulating an Economic Policy Framework to set the scope for next-gen reforms in the country, has a target to improve the productivity of factors of production, namely, land, labour, capital, entrepreneurship and technology. This shall pave the way for enabling achievement of a target of 25% manufacturing sector contribution to the nation’s GDP over the course of next 7-10 years.While the overall outlook is positive, the extension of tax benefits under Section 115BAB for manufacturing entities and the absence of new PLI schemes are notable omissions.The country’s manufacturing base is expanding as is reflective from the continuously increasing tax collections and expanding Purchasing Manager’s Index. It would be pertinent to see how the ground realities evolve vis-à-vis the vision envisaged, in the upcoming Financial Year.","The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth.

Budget 2024: Armed with the vision to propel India to become a developed country by 2047, the Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business thereby providing the required stimulus to the manufacturing sector and enabling large scale job creation.On the Indirect tax front, the industry welcomes the much-needed announcement for a comprehensive review of the rate structure under Customs enabling ease in product classification and dispute reduction.The proposal of lowering of Customs duty on a plethora of raw materials and products including solar cells, critical minerals and bullion are encouraging measures. The rationale behind such reduction clearly indicates support towards domestic manufacturing, deepening value addition and supporting targets in reducing carbon footprint.Relevant amendments under the Customs law have been made to provide increased time limits for re-imports and re-exports to enhance competitiveness of the fledgling MRO sector. The government has extended significant duty reduction and exemption benefits to the healthcare and electronics sectors, continuing the impetus of incentives provided under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme.Since their introduction in March 2020, the PLI schemes have indeed supported in revitalizing the manufacturing sector and strengthening the necessary supply chains. The success achieved in the mobile manufacturing sector has now enabled the Government to reduce customs duties on mobile phones and components, signalling a mature environment. The Budget proposals aim at reproducing similar outcomes for semiconductor and pharmaceutical industry by increasing the budgetary allocation.Buoyed by the increasing revenue collection under GST signalling a shift towards a mature tax regime, this Budget has harmonized the timeframes for the issuance of demand notices and adjudication orders for cases involving fraud, suppression or otherwise. Significant amendments to the GST legislations have been introduced reflecting the recommendations proposed by the GST Council such as regularizing non-levy of GST due to general practice which may turn out to be a breather for certain impacted industries reeling under huge tax demands.The Insurance sector has been provided much relief through the GST council recommendations which have been cemented in the present budget thereby ending long standing disputes on their business practices.The Government's efforts to push forward with its reform agenda are evident as plans to incentivize states for their business reform actions plans and digitalization through the Jan Vishwas Bill 2.0 is proposed. Further, setting up of e-commerce export hubs is envisaged to facilitate easier access to international markets for domestic players.The recent implementation of Budget proposals allows the government to maintain momentum in its reform agenda. These policy measures implicitly reaffirm the significance of India Inc as a crucial element in the development of infrastructure. However, there are still some expectations required to be met to march towards a Viksit Bharat 2047.",The Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business.

Budget 2024 : Real estate, a significant contributor to employment generation, has received a fair bit of attention in Budget 2024-25. Recent years have seen the sector transform rapidly, driven by factors such as favourable government policies, Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, strong economic growth and changing consumer preferences.Added to that, the budgetary focus on job creation, skilling and employment-linked incentives, infrastructure, urban development, rural connectivity, digitalisation and land-related norms, all dovetail to promote growth of the sector.Launched in June 2015, the PMAY aims to provide affordable housing to all eligible beneficiaries. The budget unveiled PMAY Urban 2.0, under which the housing needs of 1 crore urban poor and middle class will be addressed with an investment of Rs 10 lakh crore.The central government’s additional Rs 2.2 lakh crore injection in the next 5 years to make housing more affordable has the potential to revitalise the affordable housing market.Such an approach can play an important role in realising the government's vision of Housing for All and push growth and development. Hence, the significant investment under PMAY Urban 2.0 is expected to alleviate urban housing deficits, spurring construction and economic growth.Steps to introduce technological reforms within the regulatory framework for land, such as digitalisation or GIS mapping of land records, will improve transparency.Rationalisation of stamp duty across states will also be critical to bring in uniformity and initiate land-related reforms such as urban planning, usage and building bylaws.These are steps in the right direction and will boost growth. Moreover, they will improve the ease of property transactions and strengthen municipal finances through increased property taxes. Rationalization of stamp duty with an emphasis on women homebuyers may boost home-buyer sentiment in major cities, too.The budget has also given ample attention to urban and rural development, with rental housing for industrial workers through the public private partnership model, interest subsidies for rental housing, and transit-oriented developments.The proposal to develop investment-ready plug-and-play industrial parks in 100 cities may attract industrial investment, leading to increased demand for industrial real estate and support the growth of ancillary services and residential developments in these regions.Initiatives for industrial parks and rental housing for industrial workers align with the country’s manufacturing goals and addresses worker accommodation needs.These steps are expected to promote industrial growth and stability in labour-intensive sectors, while also creating new opportunities for real estate developers specialising in rental and affordable housing.The changes in long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax, however, have evoked a mixed reaction. The government lowered the long-term capital gains tax from 20% to 12.5%, which is a welcome step. However, this came with the removal of the indexation benefit.The changes could encourage more liquidity in property transactions and potentially increase the effective tax burden depending on the property’s acquisition date.The launch of Phase IV of the PM Gram Sadak Yojana in 25,000 rural habitations will improve connectivity in rural areas, promoting rural development and making these regions more accessible for investment. The primary objective of PMGSY is to build robust, all-weather roads in rural habitations. This initiative focuses on enhancing connectivity and supporting economic development in rural areas.In essence, the budget is geared towards stimulating growth and investment in the real estate sector , fostering a more transparent and investor-friendly environment, and contributing to overall development.

New Budget 2024 rule: Why Income Tax Department is likely to issue a huge number of tax notices this month,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-budget-2024-rule-why-income-tax-department-is-likely-to-issue-a-huge-number-of-tax-notices-this-month/articleshow/112186079.cms,"Taxing Times

Income Tax Notice on the way? The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month, as there are concerns that many taxpayers might escape the tax net due to the impending implementation of the new reassessment law on September 1, 2024.According to the amended regulation announced in Budget 2024 , the tax authorities can only go back a maximum of five years to reassess a taxpayer's records if the escaped income is at least Rs 50 lakh, and three years for an amount less than Rs 50 lakh.Previously, they could reassess cases up to 10 years old.According to an ET report, tax officials are now faced with the challenge of compiling and corroborating data on tax and income mismatches for the financial years 2013-14 to 2017-18 within the next few weeks, as these years will become time-barred for reassessment from September 1, 2024.The I-T department relies on information from various sources, such as banks, property registrars, and search findings from the investigation wing, to build reassessment cases.A tax officers' body has raised concerns about the feasibility of issuing notices under Section 148 (or 148A) in a large number of cases within a single month, given the overburdened nature of the jurisdictional assessing officers and the time-consuming process of obtaining sanction from the chief commissioner, who is the specified authority for such notices.Moreover, the law provides taxpayers with the right to explain their position before reassessment orders are finalized, a process that most believe cannot be completed by the end of August.Also Read | ITR refund status for FY 2023-24: How to check income tax refund status online - here’s a step-by-step guide for incometax.gov.in & NSDL websites The Central Board of Direct Taxes ( CBDT ) has been urged by its officers to postpone the effective date of the proposed amendment. However, this suggestion is unlikely to be well-received by corporations and high net worth individuals.""Capping the reassessment period at five years was a great decision as it would reduce hassles and litigation. But if the department fears there could be a genuine loss of revenue as it may not be possible to wrap up several matters by August 31, the government can think of strict parameters where time-bound cases can be selectively reopened - based on trails of steps taken in identifying escaped income,"" said Mitil Chokshi, partner at CA firm Chokshi & Chokshi.""Taxpayers may expect a rush of reassessment notices in August 2024. These notices are likely to be for the AYs 2018-19 and prior to that. It is pertinent to note that the Bombay High Court in a recent ruling in a case of Hexaware Technologies has taken a view on a proviso introduced in 2021, which can be interpreted to mean that AY 2017-18 (and prior years) got time barred on March 31, 2024. These reassessment notices (for AYs 2017-18 and prior) are likely to rake up new interpretation issues in the already muddled reassessment provisions,"" said Ashish Mehta, partner at law firm Khaitan & Co.The current situation is similar to the conflict between the Income Tax office and taxpayers in 2021. The reassessment law was amended in April 2021, allowing the tax office to reopen 10-year-old tax returns if the total undisclosed income exceeded Rs 50 lakh and reassess 4-year-old matters if the amount was less than Rs 50 lakh.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? However, this change led to over 10,000 writ petitions being filed by companies, arguing that they were not given sufficient time to explain and that the notices were issued without considering the carve-out that cases which couldn't be reopened earlier couldn't be reassessed under the new law.The Supreme Court invoked its extraordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution on May 4, 2022, to uphold all reassessment notices issued after March 31, 2021. However, the court left room for judicial proceedings based on the merits of each case, and several such matters are currently pending before the court.","The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month.

How NPS will increase tax savings

NPS and EPF: Overlapping services

What is NPS Vatsalaya?

Latest NPS rules, news: In the Union Budget 2024 speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced two new initiatives with regard to National Pension Scheme (NPS) - extension of NPS 14% employer contribution benefits to private setcor and the intended launch of NPS Vatsalya.Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries, bringing it at par with the provisions available for government employees.Sriram Iyer, CEO, HDFC Pension Management told ET that with this move the “ground rules have been harmonised among government and non-government employees, which is a positive step.”Effectively, this means that now, private-sector employees can choose to reduce the taxable portion of employers’ contribution to their NPS corpus, thereby paying less tax and leaving greater funds in their pension deposits.“Employees will benefit from tax savings . More importantly, the 40% increase in contribution will have a significant impact on the terminal value of the retirement corpus,” remarked Iyer. The extended savings will “help in retirement planning, working as an option that is at par with the Provident Fund,” Dinesh Rohira, CEO & Founder, 5nance.com was quoted as saying.Moreover, the endeavour aims to increase NPS penetration by increasing tax incentives for the private sector, providing them a social security-cushion post-retirement.The scheme’s motive to widen the NPS subscriber base may not prove to be flawlessly effective, however. This is explained by Agrees Mrin Agarwal, Founder, Finsafe India: “While it’s good that the limit has been raised, it may not increase adoption as employees need to be educated in a big way. Also, the benefit is only for the salaried opting for the new tax regime,” she says.The mandatory contribution to the EPF, too, threatens to relegate the provisions of NPS under the umbrella of near-superfluity. This sentiment is echoed by Varun Sahay, a software engineer in a Delhi-based IT company: “When 12% of my salary is already deducted for the EPF, why should I put in more in the NPS and cut my take-home pay?”Rohira feels otherwise. “There’s no competition between the NPS and EPF as employees can contribute to both and build a 3-4 times bigger corpus while earning 3-4% higher returns via marketlinked options in the NPS,” he counters.Also Check | New Tax Regime 2023 vs 2024 After Budget: How Much Income Tax Will Salaried Taxpayers Save & How Do New Tax Slabs Compare To Old Regime? Top 10 Points You Must Know To jumpstart retirement savings for children, a new initiative called NPS Vatsalya has been unveiled in the Budget. This scheme allows parents and guardians to contribute to a minor's account, which can be converted into a regular NPS account once the child reaches adulthood.""It provides a very long duration for reaping the compounding benefits and accumulating a huge bounty at a later age. This can be a good way to plan a better future for kids who may not opt for a service segment in the future,"" says Rohira. Sriram Iyer agrees, stating, ""It’s a good move to help the child start his retirement journey. Even if a parent starts when the child is 10 years old, by the time he starts working, it can be a solid foundation for the compounding journey after that.""However, some experts question the utility of a product with such a long lock-in period, especially when parents cannot use the funds for essential goals like their child’s education amidst soaring education costs of 11-12%.""Parents are struggling to save for their own retirement, so it might be a bit of a stretch to expect them to save for their kids’ retirement. The need of the hour is a market-linked product that allows withdrawals only for the child’s education,"" says Mrin Agarwal, Founder of Finsafe India.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? Though the NPS permits partial withdrawals, it allows only 25% of the corpus after three years of joining, and this can be done only three times during the entire tenure. A premature exit before 60 years with 100% withdrawal is only possible if the corpus is less than Rs.2.5 lakh, an amount insufficient for most children's goals.""In its current form, there won’t be any uptake,"" asserts Agarwal. Rohira concurs, ""It’s a vanilla product with a lock-in, which does not make it very attractive and it may not take off. However, the government may optimise it and introduce new features later."" Iyer adds, ""This is just a start and there may be more subscriber-friendly features as we take it to the market. The regulator is proactive and open to feedback.""","Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries.

Gold import duty cut: Why Indians may not find buying gold from Dubai as attractive post Budget 2024,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-import-duty-cut-why-indians-may-not-find-buying-gold-from-dubai-as-attractive-post-budget-2024/articleshow/112097671.cms,"Gold import duty cut: Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group, estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India.

Gold import duty cut in Budget 2024: The recent reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai. Indian jewellers with stores in both India and the UAE believe that the narrowed duty differential will result in lower gold prices in India, making it less attractive for Indians to purchase gold in Dubai.The emirate had attracted gold-enthusiast Indians following a steep rise in customs duty in India in July 2022. In the fiscal 2024-25 budget, the duty on gold imports was more than halved.The duty cut is also expected to boost gold jewellery production in India, particularly the popular 'Kolkatti' jewellery from Kolkata, which is favored by Indian expats in Dubai and tourists from various countries. This move will encourage gold artisans to create new designs in both heavyweight and lightweight jewellery, attracting consumers to purchase gold from India.According to an ET report, Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group , estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India as Indian tourists who previously bought jewellery in Dubai will now prefer to shop in India. However, Indian expats living in Dubai and other customers may continue to buy from the UAE.Also Read | Gold losing sheen? Government cuts gold bond issuance target as investors look at better alternatives Rajiv Popley, director at Popley & Sons, believes that the perception of overseas gold being cheaper than in India is merely a mindset. He points out that the labour cost is significantly lower in India, and with the introduction of mandatory hallmarking and HUID numbers, the purity of gold in India is no longer a concern.Furthermore, NRIs in Dubai do not receive VAT refunds, and Indians travelling abroad only receive about 60% of the VAT back on their gold purchases. Gold trade analyst Bhargav Baidya suggests that the 1% duty differential between gold jewellery in India and Dubai will be offset by Indian jewellers offering discounts to retain and attract customers.Saurabh Gadgil, chairman of PNG Jewellers, notes that Indian import duty is now on par with the US, allowing Indian jewellers to offer competitive prices compared to other countries worldwide. The reduced customs duty is expected to make gold purchases in India more attractive and convenient for Indian consumers, potentially leading to a significant shift in their gold shopping preferences.","The reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers.

Gold Bonds losing sheen

Gold losing sheen? The government has reduced its target for issuing gold bonds in the financial year 2024-25 by 38% compared to the previous interim budget goal, according to a senior official. The revised target stands at Rs 18,500 crore, down from Rs 29,638 crore estimated in the interim budget and Rs 26,852 crore (revised estimate) in 2023-24.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told ET ""The decision followed a reassessment of various factors, including investor demand, other investment products and uncertainties around the global economy, as the situation has changed since the interim budget in February.""After accounting for redemptions, the net issuances of sovereign gold bonds are now estimated at Rs 15,000 crore for this fiscal year, a significant decrease from the Rs 26,138 crore projected in the interim budget and Rs 25,352 crore in the revised estimate for 2023-24.Harish Galipelli, director at ILA Commodities India, attributed this shift to retail investors increasingly opting for equities in anticipation of better returns. He also noted that people are uncertain about the potential for further increases in gold prices in the short-to-medium term following a recent rally. Additionally, Galipelli pointed out that savings in rural areas have been impacted by retail inflation and other factors.The gold bond and gold monetisation schemes were introduced by the government in late 2015 to discourage the physical purchase of precious metals and reduce imports, thereby mitigating the negative impact on the current account deficit.The gross collection through these two schemes is now projected to be Rs 20,030 crore in 2024-25, compared to Rs 31,168 crore in the interim budget and Rs 28,240 crore (revised estimate) in the previous fiscal year. Similarly, the net collection is estimated at Rs 16,433 crore, down from Rs 27,571 crore in the interim budget and Rs 26,653 crore in the previous year. However, the estimates for the gold monetisation scheme remain unchanged from the interim budget level.Also Read | Budget 2024: Duty cuts on gold, silver, platinum, and diamonds to make jewellery more affordable The sovereign gold bond scheme targets investors who view gold as an investment, encouraging them to purchase paper gold instead of physical gold.On the other hand, the gold monetisation scheme aims to bring out idle gold held by households, temple trusts, and others to increase domestic supply. Both schemes were designed to curb gold imports, which, along with crude oil, have been significant contributors to India's current account deficit.

Erika Diarte-Carr , a 33-year-old mother of two from Utah, is facing a heart-wrenching reality after being given just three months to live. The young mom was diagnosed with Stage 4 small cell lung carcinoma in May 2022 while undergoing shoulder surgery. Her journey has been both physically and emotionally taxing, and in January, she received another devastating diagnosis: Cushing Syndrome .This rare disorder, caused by an overproduction of cortisol, affects only a small fraction of the population—between 40 to 70 people out of every million, according to the National Institutes of Health. The syndrome, if left untreated, can be life-threatening, adding further complexity to Erika's already difficult battle with cancer.On her GoFundMe page, Erika recently shared the grim news from her oncologist. “I have been given 3 months to live,” she wrote. “3 months to spend with my babies and loved ones. 3 months to make the best of what time I have left.” Her children, Jeremiah, 7, and Aaliyah, 5, are at the forefront of her thoughts as she faces the unimaginable task of planning her own funeral.With financial concerns weighing heavily, Erika explained that she has been unable to work and has no life insurance or savings. “I need to make sure my kids will be okay after I am gone,” she wrote. Her initial goal was to raise $5,000 to cover funeral costs and leave something behind for her children.In an extraordinary show of support, Erika’s story has touched the hearts of many. As of this week, her GoFundMe has raised over $840,000 from more than 29,000 donors, far surpassing her initial goal. Humbled by the generosity, she plans to set up a trust fund for her children. “That way, I can leave behind something for them and still ensure they are going to be ok as they grow up,” Erika shared.Her gratitude shines through as she reflects on the kindness of strangers. “Me and my family thank you ALL from the bottom of our hearts,” she wrote, adding, “[My children] are my whole life, light, and soul. My children are my fight and what keep me going.”In the little time she has left, Erika hopes to create lasting memories with her children. The three will soon embark on a special trip together, and she’s hopeful they will spend one final Christmas as a family.","Erika Diarte-Carr, 33, was diagnosed with Stage 4 small cell lung carcinoma.

Newcastle is experiencing rapid transformation and economic growth, positioning itself as a key player in meeting evolving market demands. As Australia's seventh-largest city, Newcastle serves as a vital global gateway with direct access to both national and international markets through its airport and the Port of Newcastle, one of the world’s largest exporting ports.This strategic advantage has propelled Newcastle and the Hunter region to become the largest regional economy in Australia, creating a growing demand for skilled professionals across various industries.At the heart of the transformation is The University of Newcastle, Australia offering cutting-edge programs in health economics , material science and engineering, and cyber security. These programs are designed to equip students with the skills and knowledge needed to address challenges and build career opportunities in a growing, innovative environment. As Newcastle expands its economic footprint, it creates a prime environment for professionals to make a lasting impact.As healthcare systems grow more complex and the need for affordable and fair healthcare rises, health economics is becoming increasingly important. To address these challenges, there is a need to advance in health economics, and Newcastle, Australia is leading this progress. The redevelopment of the John Hunter Hospital campus through the John Hunter Health and Innovation Precinct will expand and improve clinical services while boosting health, education, and research in the area.As a leading institution in health research, the University of Newcastle Australia offers specialised Master of Health Economics, Management and Policy programs, that explore health through business and social sciences, focusing on economics, data analytics, leadership, management, and policy evaluation. The University's graduates are in demand, with 94.4% employed within four months of graduating1, taking on executive, management, administrator and analyst roles in the ever-growing health sector.Professor Francesco Paolucci, Master of Health Economics, Management and Policy, Program Convenor remarkedAccredited by the Australasian College of Health Services Management (ACHSM) and the Royal Australasian College of Medical Administrators (RACMA), the program has a strong connectivity with industry and governments through the Value in Health Economics and Policy group at the Newcastle Business School which is accredited by both EQUIS and AACSB.Newcastle, Australia’s move towards a more sustainable economy has made material science engineering a key area of growth in Engineering. The city is becoming a hub for advanced manufacturing companies and research facilities dedicated to reducing environmental impact.The Hunter region is a powerhouse in energy, research, and innovation, with the infrastructure and expertise to boost renewable hydrogen generation. As a result, engineering graduates specialising in material science are in high demand in Newcastle and across Australia, particularly in fields like defence, medical technology, environmental services, catalysis, petrochemical, adsorption and separation, metallurgist, mining and minerals, pharmaceuticals, chemical engineering, clean fuels, energy technology (solar cells, batteries, super-capacitors and fuel cells) and data analyst (financial and information).Students choosing to study the Master of Material Science and Engineering program, will have the opportunity to study with a team of world-leading materials science experts in the Global Innovative Centre for Advanced Nanomaterials (GICAN) and learn from leading experts best in their field including Professor of Nanomaterials & Director of GICAN, Professor Ajayan Vinu .According to Professor Vinu, “We have combined deep-rooted theoretical learning with the current application in this program. GICAN has established a huge number of international collaboration and industry partnerships. These connections will help the students find future job opportunities for solving global issues.”The University’s project-based learning approach, particularly through opportunities at the GICAN centre, prepares students for high-paced industrial research and offers insights into the industrial work environment, equipping them with the skills needed to meet the demands of both individuals and industry.In an increasingly interconnected world, cybersecurity skills have become indispensable across industries, from finance to healthcare. As businesses and institutions rely more on digital systems, ensuring data integrity and maintaining trust are paramount. In this evolving landscape, cybersecurity plays a critical role in protecting sensitive information and securing the future of Newcastle’s growing digital economy.The increasing dependence on networked applications for accessing information and making critical business decisions has made securing cyberspace essential for individuals, enterprises, and governments. This shift has driven a rising demand for cybersecurity professionals, with 29,100 new Database & Systems Administrators and ICT Security specialists expected to be needed by 20262.By studying a Master of Cyber Security at the University of Newcastle, students will gain extensive knowledge in cyber systems and infrastructures, addressing the human and legal aspects of cyber security. Employment growth for cyber security professionals needed by 2026 is projected to rise by 38.9%2. These employment prospects combined with the severe skills shortages faced globally, places cyber security professionals in high demand.In Australia, ICT Security professionals can also earn an above average median weekly income of AUD$2,3422, while exploring a variety of career prospects including cryptographer, cyber security analyst, cyber security architect, devOps engineer, IT security engineer, network engineer, security consultant, security system developer, security system manager.For graduates in these fields, Newcastle offers a unique blend of career opportunities, lifestyle advantages, and a supportive community that encourages professional growth, making it an ideal place for those looking to build a successful and impactful career.References -1 Graduate Outcomes Survey 2020 – 2022, Postgraduate - Business and Management2 Labourmarketinsights.gov.auImage Source: City of Newcastle,2024","Newcastle is experiencing rapid transformation and economic growth, positioning itself as a key player in meeting evolving market demands.

ROME: Italian manufacturing activity contracted for a sixth month running in September and at a faster pace than the month before, a survey showed on Tuesday, amid declines in output and new orders.The HCOB Global Purchasing Managers' Index ( PMI ) for manufacturing in the euro zone's third-largest economy declined to 48.3 from August's 49.4, sinking further below the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction.The result was below a median forecast of 49.0 in a Reuters survey of nine analysts.""The situation in Italy's manufacturing sector remains grim. While the headline index saw a slight improvement in August, it has now dropped again in September, remaining firmly in recessionary territory,"" said HCOB economist Jonas Feldhusen .""The global downturn in manufacturing activity, which has worsened in the third quarter, is clearly impacting Italian manufacturers,"" he said, citing competition from abroad, high interest rates and prices among the factors dampening demand.The manufacturing output sub-index decreased to 47.4 from 49.1 the month before, while the new orders indicator declined even more steeply to 45.7 from 48.8.National statistics bureau ISTAT said last month that Italy's 2023 economic growth was weaker than previously estimated, but also revised down the budget deficit and public debt as a proportion of output.Italy is targeting 1% economic growth this year and 1.2% in 2025 and has revised down its deficit goals as a proportion of gross domestic product (GDP) for both this year and next, sources told Reuters.",The HCOB Global Purchasing Managers' Index ( PMI ) for manufacturing in the euro zone's third-largest economy declined to 48.3 from August's 49.4.

Government approval

Qatar Airways will buy a 25 per cent stake in Virgin Australia from U.S. private equity firm Bain Capital , posing a tougher contest for Qantas Airways that has dominated Australian routes and pushed back against giving access to the Middle Eastern carrier.The purchase of the minority stake for an undisclosed amount will need to be signed off by Australia's government, which denied Qatar Airways' requests last year to fly additional services into Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth.""This partnership brings the missing piece to Virgin Australia's longer-term strategy,"" Virgin Australia CEO Jayne Hrdlicka said in a statement.""It means that we've got an important shareholder who has a scale that we don't have, who has the expertise that we don't have, that can help us compete better domestically by giving us access to that scale,"" Hrdlicka said later in an interview with ABC television on Tuesday.Shares in Qantas fell as much as 4.3 per cent by 0239 GMT and were among the worst performers on the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index.The stake sale also serves as a cornerstone investment ahead of an anticipated return of Virgin Australia into public ownership, the companies said.Bain said last year it would explore an IPO of Virgin Australia, which it bought for A$3.5 billion ($2.42 billion) including liabilities after it was placed in voluntary administration in 2020.Bain was targeting an A$1 billion listing, but the plans were delayed, Reuters reported last year.Bain declined to comment further on the IPO plans.As part of the deal with Qatar Airways, Virgin Australia plans to launch flights from Brisbane, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney to Doha with leased aircraft by mid-2025, subject to approval from Australia's competition regulator.That would allow Qatar to gain more traffic to its Doha hub, regardless of whether the Australian government approves Qatar Airways' push for more flying rights.The denial last year raised questions about the Australian government's relationship with Qantas, which lobbied against more access for the Qatari carrier. Qantas has a partnership with Dubai-based Emirates, a rival of Qatar Airways.Qantas did not respond immediately to a request for comment.Qatar Airways CEO Badr Mohammed Al Meer in Tuesday's joint statement said his airline believed competition in aviation was ""a good thing and it helps raise the bar, ultimately benefiting customers.""Australia's Foreign Investment Review Board must approve the sale of the Virgin Australia stake to Qatar Airways, but the treasurer has the power after that to accept or reject the recommendation and impose conditions on the deal.""It wouldn't be appropriate for me to pre-empt that process or comment further,"" Australian Treasurer Jim Chalmers told reporters after the deal was announced. ""More broadly, we do want to see a strong, secure airline industry that delivers for consumers.""Qatar Airways also owns minority stakes in British Airways owner IAG, Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways and China Southern Airlines.","Qatar Airways will buy a 25 per cent stake in Virgin Australia from U.S. private equity firm Bain Capital.

FOMO grips China stock buyers on ‘epic’ trading day before break,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/fomo-grips-china-stock-buyers-on-epic-trading-day-before-break/articleshow/113822270.cms,"The Fear and Greed Indicator of the Shanghai Composite Index, rose to the highest since 2015 on Monday.

‘Painful Time’

For Shao Qifeng, the frenzy in Chinese stock trading in the last five sessions was a first in his 15-year market career.The Beijing-based chief investment officer at Ying An Asset Management Co. has been receiving non-stop client inquiries in his WeChat groups asking whether this is the time to buy stocks, after authorities unveiled a stimulus blitz last week.“I think this means we are in the second phase of a bull market, when stocks are getting wide attention,” Shao said. “On the surface, I’m keeping my cool, but deep down in my heart I’m celebrating.”Shao’s experience was shared by many stock investors in China where the benchmark index posted the biggest gain since 2008 on Monday, entering a bull market. The rush into the market before a weeklong holiday has also sent trading turnover to a record high. The interest was so intense that broker applications collapsed and requests for opening trading accounts surged, according to local media.The latest leap came after three of China’s largest cities relaxed rules for homebuyers, while the central bank also moved to lower mortgage rates. The measures were among the key elements of a sweeping stimulus package released last Tuesday that also included interest rate cuts, freeing-up of cash for banks, as well as liquidity support for stocks. Meanwhile, the Golden Dragon index of US-listed Chinese stocks rallied 4.7%.While Chinese stocks have produced multiple false dawns in recent years, there appears to be growing conviction that this time may be different given the sense of urgency that authorities have shown to achieve their ambitious economic growth target of around 5% this year.The surging retail interest has even prompted some funds to impose a cap on how much people can buy. Beijing Jiuyang Runquan Capital Management, for example, set a one-million-yuan ($142,603) limit on fund subscriptions for investors.For Winnie Wu, chief China equity strategist at BofA Securities, caution still lingers with many of her clients asking whether it’s time to take profit after a few days of strong gains.“It’s really hard to either chase the rally or adjust positions. It’s a very exciting time, but it is also a very difficult, challenging, painful time for many investors,” she said.So far, the fear of missing out is palpable. Brokerages, typically seen as a barometer for market sentiment, led gains Monday with many posting double-digit jump. A Bloomberg Intelligence gauge of Chinese property developers rose as much as 15.7%. Hedge funds are selling US technology stocks and piling into mining and materials firms. Meanwhile, iron ore spiked about 11% as investors bet that China’s efforts to ease property woes will improve demand from the world’s top consumer of the steel-making ingredient.The pivot towards risk assets has sent the country’s ten-year sovereign bonds reeling Monday, extending their biggest weekly drop in a decade.The Fear and Greed Indicator of the Shanghai Composite Index, which measures the buying and selling momentum for the stock benchmark popular among China’s retail investors, rose to the highest since 2015 on Monday.“This is an epic day in the Chinese market history,” said Hao Hong, chief economist at Grow Investment Group. “This is one of the happiest days” of his 30 years covering the Chinese market, he added.Some are urging cooler heads, after being burned chasing past rallies in Chinese stocks.“I must confess, after busily gobbling on this week-long policy banquet, my concern about a potential replay of the previous disappointing cycle lingers,” said Hebe Chen, an analyst at IG Markets Ltd. “It’s still too early to tell if this ‘Golden-Week rush’ will blossom into a true gold rush or fizzle out into another mirage.”",The Shanghai Composite Index posted the biggest gain since 2008 on Monday.

The 2024 CBI Index has unveiled the leading countries for Citizenship by Investment (CBI) programmes, showcasing more than 12 global jurisdictions.This year’s edition, themed 'Transparency Meets Transition: A CBI Reset', delivered an in-depth assessment of the industry’s evolving landscape, highlighting both the challenges and opportunities faced by the sector, along with its ongoing pursuit of transparency and cooperation.For the fourth consecutive year, St. Kitts and Nevis secured the top spot in the Citizenship by Investment (CBI) industry, earning an impressive overall score of 84 percent.Dominica maintained its position at the second spot with a score of 80 percent, marking its second year in this rank. Close behind, Grenada claimed third place with 77 percent, while Saint Lucia and Antigua and Barbuda both garnered 74 percent, taking the fourth and fifth positions, respectively.CBI Index 2024.The latest report revealed that the five Eastern Caribbean nations offering Citizenship by Investment (CBI) programmes have dominated the top rankings, securing all five leading positions.Praising the Caribbean islands for consistently maintaining their top spots among 12 jurisdictions, the CBI Index stated,In contrast, European programmes, including those of Malta, Türkiye, and Austria, also performed well, securing high positions in the rankings.Türkiye's CBI programme ranked 7th with a score of 63%, while Egypt moved up to the 9th spot with 59%. Both programmes experienced improvements when compared with the previous year, with Türkiye advancing by one position and Egypt increasing its score by two percentage points.Jordan and Cambodia concluded the rankings, with Cambodia descending to the twelfth position this year, having been previously surpassed by Jordan. Cambodia's score of 49% indicated a slight decline in its performance.However, while India does not offer second citizenship, India's Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) card offers a unique opportunity for individuals of Indian origin to maintain their connection to the country while enjoying the benefits of multiple entry and multi-purpose visas. This allows them to visit India frequently and participate in various activities without the need for a second citizenship.One of the significant issues which were addressed by the CBI Index 2024 isin the Citizenship by Investment industry.According to the Index,The Index also mentions that comprehensive due diligence and compliance are significant within the CBI industry and countries of respective programmes have tailored compliance processes to address the complexity of applicants to ensure that vetting remains within the parameters of the regulations which govern the programmes.This year's CBI Index is based on nine pillars of excellence, which form the foundation of the entire ranking system.These pillars include standard of living, freedom of movement, investment options and threshold, mandatory travel or residence, citizenship timeline, ease of processing, due diligence, family, and certainty of product.St. Kitts and Nevis emerged as the top performer, achieving a perfect score of 10 in four key pillars: Mandatory Travel or Residence, Ease of Processing, Due Diligence, and Certainty of Product.Malta earned the highest score for standard of living, with nine points, due to its strong performance across sub-indicators such as relative safety, life expectancy, and freedom.Both Malta and Austria led the freedom of movement pillar with perfect scores of 10, while the Caribbean nations of St. Kitts and Nevis, Antigua and Barbuda, Saint Lucia, and Grenada followed with scores of seven.In the investment options and threshold pillar, Antigua and Barbuda, Egypt, and Saint Lucia received the highest score of 9, with St. Kitts and Nevis close behind at 8.Dominica, Grenada, St. Kitts and Nevis, and Saint Lucia all topped the mandatory travel or residence pillar, each scoring 10.For the citizenship timeline pillar, Dominica, Jordan, and Vanuatu ranked first due to their four-month application processing times.In the ease of processing pillar, Dominica, Grenada, and St. Kitts and Nevis shared the top rank with Malta.St. Kitts and Nevis stood alone at the top of the due diligence pillar, one of the most critical categories, with a perfect score of 10.Antigua and Barbuda and Grenada were recognized as the most family-friendly programmes for 2024, offering accommodating application structures that include siblings, parents, and grandparents of both the main applicant and their spouse.Lastly, St. Kitts and Nevis was the only country to score a perfect 10 in the certainty of product pillar, reflecting its swift response to international pressures on Caribbean CBI programmes.The CBI Index highlights the growing importance of adaptability in Citizenship by Investment (CBI) offerings, noting that several changes were implemented this year to ensure programmes remain fit for purpose amid shifting global events, industry expectations, and standards. These adaptations have included regional integration, adjustments to investment thresholds, and improvements in compliance and due diligence.“The Citizenship by Investment (CBI) industry has seen many twists and turns this year, but two key themes stand out: transition and transparency,” the CBI Index noted.One of the most significant changes in the industry, according to the Index, was the introduction of the Memorandum of Agreement (MoA). This MoA exemplified the central theme of the 2024 Index: where transparency meets transition.The report explained that the MoA harmonized practices across the five Caribbean CBI programmes, establishing minimum investment thresholds, facilitating information sharing between Unit heads, and setting uniform operational standards. The agreement mandated a minimum investment threshold of US$200,000, providing greater consistency in programme costs.","The 2024 CBI Index has unveiled the leading countries for Citizenship by Investment (CBI) programmes, showcasing more than 12 global jurisdictions.
