The primary driver of the losses was HDFC Bank, the most heavily weighted stock in the Nifty 50, which fell by 3.4%. While BSE Sensex ended the day at 78,956.03, down 693 points, Nifty50 closed the day at 24,139.00, down 208 points.MSCI, a global indexes provider, increased the proportion of HDFC Bank's shares available for purchase by foreign investors. However, contrary to market expectations of a single adjustment in August, the changes will be implemented in two stages, in August and November. As a result, brokerage firm Nuvama revised its earlier prediction of inflows into HDFC Bank from $3.2 billion-$4 billion to $1.8 billion for August.The decline in HDFC Bank's stock also negatively impacted the financial and banking sectors, which shed 1.9% and 1.5%, respectively.Additionally, investors became increasingly cautious due to geopolitical risks in the Middle East and concerns over the U.S. economy, leading to intensified profit booking across various sectors.According to Reuters, Siddharth Sedani, an equity analyst at Anand Rathi Financial Services, warned that ""volatility and selling pressure could rise in the next few sessions, depending on the quality of U.S. macro data.""Investors are closely monitoring U.S. producer price data, set to be released after Indian market hours, and consumer price data, scheduled for Wednesday, to gauge the timing and magnitude of potential rate cuts and assess the overall health of the U.S. economy.Twelve out of the thirteen major sectors on the Indian stock market experienced losses during the day. However, consumer firm Marico gained 2.1% after resuming its manufacturing operations in Bangladesh, while Dixon Tech and Oil India rose by approximately 2.6% and 3%, respectively, following their inclusion in the MSCI emerging markets index.","BSE Sensex and Nifty50 index both fell by 0.85% and 0.87%.

Sunil Mittal-led Bharti Enterprises to acquire 24.5% stake worth $4 billion in Britain's biggest broadband & mobile company BT Group,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sunil-mittal-led-bharti-enterprises-to-acquire-24-5-in-britains-biggest-broadband-and-mobile-company-bt/articleshow/112459841.cms,"Sunil Bharti Mittal-led Bharti Enterprises announced on Monday its intention to purchase a 24.5% stake in BT Group , the largest broadband and mobile provider in Britain. Bharti Enterprises said that it would acquire a stake worth about 3.2 billion pounds ($4 billion). The acquisition will involve buying out the shares held by Altice UK , the investment vehicle of telecoms entrepreneur Patrick Drahi , who is currently BT's largest shareholder.Drahi initially invested in BT in 2021, but Altice group has been under increasing pressure to divest assets to reduce its debts, which have reached up to $60 billion, a sum that allowed him to expand his media-to-telecoms empire during a period of low interest rates.Bharti outlined its acquisition strategy, stating that it will first acquire a 9.99% stake and then seek to purchase the remaining 14.51% after obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals. This includes voluntarily applying for clearance under the UK National Security and Investment Act.Over the past six months, BT's shares have experienced a 24% increase as the company begins to reap the benefits of its long-term investment plan to develop the country's fibre network. In June of this year, Mexican magnate Carlos Slim acquired a 3.2% stake in BT, providing a boost to Allison Kirkby, who assumed the role of BT's chief executive in February.""This scale of investment from Bharti Global is a great vote of confidence in the future of BT Group and our strategy,"" Kirkby said in a statement following the investment announcement.Bharti, for its part, emphasized that the deal also reflects confidence in Britain and its stable business and policy environment. This statement could be interpreted as a reference to the country's new Labour government, which took office last month following five years of instability under the Conservative party.""Its (BT's) focus on strengthening its networks, driving consumer growth, and optimising every aspect of its business makes it well-placed to consolidate its position as a leading global telecoms company,"" said Sunil Bharti Mittal , Chair of Bharti Enterprises, in the statement.","Bharti Enterprises said that it would acquire a stake worth about 3.2 billion pounds ($4 billion) Bharti outlined its acquisition strategy, stating that it will first acquire a 9.99% stake and then seek to purchase the remaining 14.51% after obtaining regulatory approvals.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112460109,imgsize-43076,width-400,resizemode-4/112460109.jpg"

On the other hand, Chipotle shares slid 7.5%, for a loss in value of $5.7 billion.Niccol is being hailed as the top public restaurant CEO in the US by several analysts, including Bloomberg Intelligence’s Michael Halen, who said the hire is a “no brainer.” Oppenheimer & Co’s Brian Bittner said Niccol is a “dream hire” for Starbucks. In just a few hours following the announcement, the stock received at least four upgrades, with Niccol earning praise for his successful track record as chief at Chipotle, as well as at Taco Bell, which is owned by Yum Brands.The optimism is well deserved. Chipotle shares climbed 773% since Niccol took over as CEO in March 5, 2018 through Monday’s close. Starbucks shares are up just 35% for the same period, while the S&P 500 has gained 99%.“In our view, Starbucks picks up a hall of fame restaurant CEO, and his appointment as Starbucks CEO and Chairman suggests a new era is underway,” according to TD Cowen analyst Andrew Charles, who upgraded Starbucks to buy from hold. Charles said he sees similarities between the turnaround at Chipotle and what Starbucks needs to do to improve traffic, including in marketing, product innovation, and operations.Danilo Gargiulo, a restaurants analyst at Bernstein, writes to clients that “while it is always hard to find the ‘right time’ to enter a stock, we doubt investors will find a better time to consider a position in Starbucks if the new CEO brings the same rigor as when turning around Chipotle.” He currently rates Starbucks market perform.","Shares of Seattle-based Starbucks surged 25%, the most ever, and added $21.4 billion in market capitalization.

Levi's bets big on India as it chases $10 billion target,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/levis-bets-big-on-india-as-it-chases-10-billion-target/articleshow/112508284.cms,"BENGALURU: As American denim giant Levi Strauss & Co chases its target of expanding into a $10 billion business globally from the current $6.2 billion, president and CEO Michelle Gass tells TOI that she has set her sights on India, among the top six markets for the inventor of the blue jeans, to drive the growth .Looking at the opportunity that the 170-year-old company's largest market in Asia offers, Gass, who moved into the corner office last year, has flown down most of the company's leadership team - including chief financial and growth officer Harmit Singh, an alumnus of Delhi's Shri Ram College of Commerce - to take a look at its fastest growing market.India, which houses a large cohort of young shoppers constantly seeking fresh styles, traits that make it any fashion brand's mecca, will have a ""disproportionate"" share (higher than other markets) contribution to the company's growth, Gass told TOI on her first visit to the country as CEO.""We are executing the playbook in India extremely well. We have separated ourselves from the competition. So, I am like how fast can we grow because the more we scale, the more separation we are going to create. India is critical for us to achieve our objectives. The consumer in this market is like the epitome of our target consumer, not only demographically, but psychographically,"" Gass said in an interview.Levi's under Gass is rejigging its growth strategy from having more men shopping for its iconic pair of jeans and khakis to striking a better gender balance. While leading the denim play, especially in the bottoms space, remains the thrust, it also wants to offer its customers ""a lot more"". The brand is widening its assortment of tops. ""The idea is for a shopper to find the right pair of clothing to go with their denim bottoms,"" said Gass.India, where shoppers are already buying more than one top to every one bottom against three bottoms to one top in other markets, opens up a wider scope for the brand to nudge shoppers to buy beyond its jeans.Besides, there is also an opportunity to drive adoption of denim dressing as the penetration of denim skirts and denim dresses is quite low in the country. These two pieces sum up the brand's broader global strategy of what it calls ""owning the denim lifestyle"", a bet that is expected to drive growth for the next decade.""...owning the denim lifestyle... that's probably the biggest area we sharpened our focus on. It isn't just growing the tops business but doing it through the denim lifestyle, owning head to toe, even denim dressing,"" Gass said.In India, getting more assortment for women beyond jeans, increasing the merchandising space for them is paying off. ""In India, 20% of our business used to be from the women segment; now it's 30%,"" said chief financial and growth officer Harmit Singh, adding that Indian consumers are a lot more confident than their Western counterparts and are spending more.Levi's faces stiff competition from global brands such as Zara and H&M in the non-denim space.",President and CEO Michelle Gass has set her sights on India to drive the growth.

"Cognizant's Rs 2.5 lakh annual pay, a decadal low, sparks outrage",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/cognizants-rs-2-5-lakh-annual-pay-a-decadal-low-sparks-outrage/articleshow/112508121.cms,"BENGALURU: Cognizant 's off-campus recruitment drive, expected to begin on Wednesday, has sparked a debate and meme fests across social media platforms. The company offered a yearly compensation package of Rs 2.5 lakh or Rs 20,000 a month, which many consider to be a regressive step in the Indian IT services industry .Indian IT firms typically offer engineering graduates annual salaries in the range of Rs 3.5 lakh to Rs 4 lakh on average.The Rs 2.5 lakh annual salary is a new decadal low for the Indian IT sector , frowned upon by digital natives calibrating their career paths if this is in the offing. In an effort to grow their margins, IT companies are offering lower salaries to entry-level employees . However, the current trend seems to have reached an unprecedented lower level. These salaries are predominantly in roles related to BPM (business process management), testing and infrastucture management services.Cognizant, in its job posting, said that the Rs 2.5-lakh package is for candidates graduating in the 2024 batch with any 3-year full-time degree programme who are eligible to apply. This is a new low in Indian IT services, which is prevalent in roles in BNS and infrastructure management. Companies usually hire 70% of their fresher requirements from campuses between June and December, and depending on the demand pipeline, they source freshers from the open market, including non-technical graduates who make the cut. The Rs 2.5-lakh annual package has raised concerns about how IT firms, which closely track the cost-of-living index across all geographies, haven't closely looked at how expenses have risen in India over time. One of the users took to X to share his view, ""That's barely enough to cover a year's rent in a village and a few packets of Maggi.

Wipro, in its job posting, has said freshers will get a joining bonus of Rs 75,000 and Rs 15,000 as a stipend for the first year and Rs 488 as ESI insurance coverage. This translates into 2.6 lakh annually for the first year. With no bonus component in the second year, they receive a stipend of Rs 17,000 and ESI coverage of Rs 533 a month, which translates to Rs 2.1 lakh annually. Only in the fourth year do they receive a stipend of Rs 23,000 a month, which translates into an annual package of Rs 2.7 lakh. Wipro has an inbuilt penalty clause which states that trainees are liable to pay Rs 75,000 on a pro-rata basis if they leave the organisation before completing their 5 years of the training agreement. Emails sent to Cognizant and Wipro didn't elicit a response till the time of going to press.Krishna Vij, business head of IT staffing at Teamlease Digital, said the compensation benchmark of Rs 3-6 lakh for fresh engineering graduates has remained largely unchanged over the past 8-10 years.","The Rs 2.5 lakh annual salary is a new decadal low for the Indian IT sector.

Railway Budget 2024 : The government has wavered little in its efforts to spur a modernisation of railways in the country, pivoting on technology, to support the country’s economic ambitions. In line with expectations, Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore, marking yet another year of successive increase in outlay.That takes forward the past policies and the government’s vision, which have paved the way for modernisation of the transport behemoth.In earlier decades, the government had focused on laying tracks on new routes, electrification and incremental rolling stock capacity addition. That was the need of the hour back then and has helped set up the base for a larger transformation.For instance, the massive Dedicated Freight Corridor ( DFC ) as well as locomotive factories at Marhaura and Madhepura in Bihar were conceptualised over a decade ago and we are seeing their completion now.More recently, the focus has shifted to modernisation—of rolling stock and safety systems, among other aspects.This year, emphasis has also been laid on the railways’ crucial role in industrial development. Commodity-specific corridors have been planned in eastern India and impetus given to port connectivity. Vande Bharat and technology-led upgrades in rolling stock remain in focus. Safety has been prioritised through budgetary allocations for the anti-collision systemKavach . That said, there are other cogs in the wheel that demand attention from a long-term perspective.First, the target for the Operating Ratio, the crucial efficiency gauge, has been set at 98.22% for 2024-25, compared with 98.65% in 2023-24. This reflects an imminent need for operational transformation. An effective overhaul of the world’s fourth-largest rail network will take many years and thus we need to start focusing on improving efficiency and reducing costs now.DFC is almost entirely operational and will be complete over the next few months. To ensure the project achieves its twin goals of reducing logistics costs and enhancing freight efficiency, railways need to attract more cargo on the corridor. This will help increase the rail coefficient and make the railways’ approach more market-oriented, which will in turn aid future corridors.A revamp of railway stations is on track, with sufficient funds dedicated to this end. But even though new coaches and wagons are increasingly being added to meet footfalls, the stations and passenger trains themselves remain synonymous with chaos.Just as safety, comfort and convenience have been prioritised, there is a need for solutions to address the capacity and demand challenges. As a first step, the government could target development of new stations and setting up of new coach production units.As a leading freight mover, Indian Railways carried a record 1,588 MT cargo in fiscal 2024, up from 1,095 MT in fiscal 2015. It accounts for 26% of the cargo moved in the country—by no means an easy feat. The railways aims to take this volume to 3,000 MT by 2030, which would require a 11% CAGR against the around 4.2% witnessed over the last 10 years. As per a report by TERI and Shakti Foundation, from carrying about 62% of freight traffic in 1990-91, Indian Railways’ share has declined to ~27% in 2014-15. This has been due to the expanding road network, cost competitiveness over railways, and door-to-door service. Thus, commencing the cycle of increasing the rail share again is commendable.DFCs, a high-capacity track network, high-power locomotives and improvement in wagon designs have set the ball rolling for larger capacity, faster freight trains that deliver better efficiency.Yet, achieving exponential growth is a tall ask given the current dynamics. Possibly, similar challenges might apply to other goals the railways might have for 2047.To be fair, despite its scale and complexity, Indian Railways has been able to achieve diverse developments at commendable speed.But the track ahead is long and it is time to start discussing the reinvention of the institutional set-up.Indian Railways sees substantial private sector involvement in the form of vendors and contractors. Policymakers could start mulling extreme options such as parallel privately-owned and operated railway infrastructure, coupled with centralised planning and an evolved role for the railways. This will need a robust policy framework from the Government of India.The time is perhaps also ripe to bring user charge and asset monetisation-driven segments for passengers as well as cargo to the discussion table. Globally, the separation of infrastructure and operations in railways has delivered mixed results, for example in the United Kingdom. The model should be analysed and revisited to understand its potential relevance in the Indian context.The key would be to retrace our steps and align our long-term goals to identify not just incremental changes but also ways to explore bold and path-breaking alternatives that put Indian Railways on a smooth track and bring it up to speed.","Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore.

Budget 2024 capital gains tax changes: The Narendra Modi government is considering suggestions for tweaks in the new long term capital gains tax regime that was announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman in Union Budget 2024.The July 23 budget reduced the LTCG tax on property from 20% to 12.5%. The indexation benefit, which allowed taxpayers to adjust the acquisition cost for inflation before calculating capital gains and thus reduce their tax liability, is proposed to be eliminated for properties purchased on or after April 1, 2001.The government publishes the Cost Inflation Index (CII) annually for this calculation.India Inc is appealing to the government for a gradual shift to the long-term capital gains tax regime proposed in the FY25 budget, which aims to eliminate indexation benefits for property, gold, and other unlisted assets.According to an ET report by Deepshikha Sikarwar, the industry is suggesting alternatives such as a higher tax rate with indexation or a lower rate of 12.5% without indexation, as well as some form of grandfathering for ancestral properties.The finance ministry is currently reviewing these proposals and will discuss them with the Prime Minister's Office. The final decision will be made closer to the date when the Finance Bill reply is to be presented in Parliament, the reports said.Industry groups are expected to submit formal proposals to the finance ministry in the near future.

Budget 2024 for manufacturing sector : The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth. While the middle class has been offered tax relief, the government's primary focus remains on judicious spending to maximize economic impact. The budget's core themes are employment, skilling, MSME development, and support for the middle class.Largely focus has remained intact on spending money judiciously to ensure that each penny spent creates a ripple effect in the entire economic landscape.Although at first glance, manufacturing might appear to have taken a backseat, a deeper analysis reveals a multifaceted approach to bolstering the sector. Initiatives like employment-linked benefits and internship programs, while primarily aimed at job creation and skill development, indirectly benefit manufacturing companies by expanding the talent pool.Extensive focus on the MSME manufacturing units by way of extending term loan facility for purchase of machinery and equipment without collateral or third-party guarantee, would help companies in augmenting their capital base/ capacity and strengthen the very foundation of the manufacturing ecosystem in the country. Development of a new credit-assessment model by Public Sector Banks to assess MSME credit shall provide much needed regulatory relief to the units.With respect to the large manufacturing entities, while there is no direct fiscal/ tax incentive introduced in this budget, some support has been provided with an extensive focus on development of ‘industrial parks’ in nearly 100 cities under the ‘plug and play’ model. Reforms proposed with respect to land administration, planning and management, shall also ease out acquisition related difficulties often faced by entrepreneurs/ business houses in acquiring lands for manufacturing set-ups.Targeted Customs duty interventions like, rationalization of Customs duty provisions in Mobile phone manufacturing setups, extension of Customs duty exemption on import of capital goods for manufacturing of solar cells and panels, full Customs duty exemption on import of 25 critical minerals,, shall provide the required impetus for enhancing domestic manufacturing environment.Governments’ focus on formulating an Economic Policy Framework to set the scope for next-gen reforms in the country, has a target to improve the productivity of factors of production, namely, land, labour, capital, entrepreneurship and technology. This shall pave the way for enabling achievement of a target of 25% manufacturing sector contribution to the nation’s GDP over the course of next 7-10 years.While the overall outlook is positive, the extension of tax benefits under Section 115BAB for manufacturing entities and the absence of new PLI schemes are notable omissions.The country’s manufacturing base is expanding as is reflective from the continuously increasing tax collections and expanding Purchasing Manager’s Index. It would be pertinent to see how the ground realities evolve vis-à-vis the vision envisaged, in the upcoming Financial Year.","The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth.

Budget 2024: Armed with the vision to propel India to become a developed country by 2047, the Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business thereby providing the required stimulus to the manufacturing sector and enabling large scale job creation.On the Indirect tax front, the industry welcomes the much-needed announcement for a comprehensive review of the rate structure under Customs enabling ease in product classification and dispute reduction. The proposal of lowering of Customs duty on a plethora of raw materials and products including solar cells, critical minerals and bullion are encouraging measures. The rationale behind such reduction clearly indicates support towards domestic manufacturing, deepening value addition and supporting targets in reducing carbon footprint.Relevant amendments under the Customs law have been made to provide increased time limits for re-imports and re-exports to enhance competitiveness of the fledgling MRO sector. The government has extended significant duty reduction and exemption benefits to the healthcare and electronics sectors, continuing the impetus of incentives provided under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme.Since their introduction in March 2020, the PLI schemes have indeed supported in revitalizing the manufacturing sector and strengthening the necessary supply chains. The success achieved in the mobile manufacturing sector has now enabled the Government to reduce customs duties on mobile phones and components, signalling a mature environment. The Budget proposals aim at reproducing similar outcomes for semiconductor and pharmaceutical industry by increasing the budgetary allocation.Buoyed by the increasing revenue collection under GST signalling a shift towards a mature tax regime, this Budget has harmonized the timeframes for the issuance of demand notices and adjudication orders for cases involving fraud, suppression or otherwise. Significant amendments to the GST legislations have been introduced reflecting the recommendations proposed by the GST Council such as regularizing non-levy of GST due to general practice which may turn out to be a breather for certain impacted industries reeling under huge tax demands.The Insurance sector has been provided much relief through the GST council recommendations which have been cemented in the present budget thereby ending long standing disputes on their business practices.The Government's efforts to push forward with its reform agenda are evident as plans to incentivize states for their business reform actions plans and digitalization through the Jan Vishwas Bill 2.0 is proposed. Further, setting up of e-commerce export hubs is envisaged to facilitate easier access to international markets for domestic players.The recent implementation of Budget proposals allows the government to maintain momentum in its reform agenda. These policy measures implicitly reaffirm the significance of India Inc as a crucial element in the development of infrastructure. However, there are still some expectations required to be met to march towards a Viksit Bharat 2047.",The Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business.

Budget 2024 : Real estate, a significant contributor to employment generation, has received a fair bit of attention in Budget 2024-25. Recent years have seen the sector transform rapidly, driven by factors such as favourable government policies, Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, strong economic growth and changing consumer preferences.Added to that, the budgetary focus on job creation, skilling and employment-linked incentives, infrastructure, urban development, rural connectivity, digitalisation and land-related norms, all dovetail to promote growth of the sector.Launched in June 2015, the PMAY aims to provide affordable housing to all eligible beneficiaries. The budget unveiled PMAY Urban 2.0, under which the housing needs of 1 crore urban poor and middle class will be addressed with an investment of Rs 10 lakh crore.The central government’s additional Rs 2.2 lakh crore injection in the next 5 years to make housing more affordable has the potential to revitalise the affordable housing market.Such an approach can play an important role in realising the government's vision of Housing for All and push growth and development. Hence, the significant investment under PMAY Urban 2.0 is expected to alleviate urban housing deficits, spurring construction and economic growth.Steps to introduce technological reforms within the regulatory framework for land, such as digitalisation or GIS mapping of land records, will improve transparency.Rationalisation of stamp duty across states will also be critical to bring in uniformity and initiate land-related reforms such as urban planning, usage and building bylaws.These are steps in the right direction and will boost growth. Moreover, they will improve the ease of property transactions and strengthen municipal finances through increased property taxes. Rationalization of stamp duty with an emphasis on women homebuyers may boost home-buyer sentiment in major cities, too.The budget has also given ample attention to urban and rural development, with rental housing for industrial workers through the public private partnership model, interest subsidies for rental housing, and transit-oriented developments.The proposal to develop investment-ready plug-and-play industrial parks in 100 cities may attract industrial investment, leading to increased demand for industrial real estate and support the growth of ancillary services and residential developments in these regions.Initiatives for industrial parks and rental housing for industrial workers align with the country’s manufacturing goals and addresses worker accommodation needs.These steps are expected to promote industrial growth and stability in labour-intensive sectors, while also creating new opportunities for real estate developers specialising in rental and affordable housing.The changes in long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax, however, have evoked a mixed reaction. The government lowered the long-term capital gains tax from 20% to 12.5%, which is a welcome step. However, this came with the removal of the indexation benefit.The changes could encourage more liquidity in property transactions and potentially increase the effective tax burden depending on the property’s acquisition date.The launch of Phase IV of the PM Gram Sadak Yojana in 25,000 rural habitations will improve connectivity in rural areas, promoting rural development and making these regions more accessible for investment. The primary objective of PMGSY is to build robust, all-weather roads in rural habitations. This initiative focuses on enhancing connectivity and supporting economic development in rural areas.In essence, the budget is geared towards stimulating growth and investment in the real estate sector , fostering a more transparent and investor-friendly environment, and contributing to overall development. It aims to create a balanced and inclusive growth environment by addressing the needs of various segments, including affordable housing, industrial workers and urban infrastructure.The effectiveness of the initiatives, however, hinges on their implementation and continued support of complementary reforms.","Budget 2024-25 is geared towards stimulating growth and investment in the real estate sector.

New Budget 2024 rule: Why Income Tax Department is likely to issue a huge number of tax notices this month,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-budget-2024-rule-why-income-tax-department-is-likely-to-issue-a-huge-number-of-tax-notices-this-month/articleshow/112186079.cms,"Taxing Times

Income Tax Notice on the way? The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month, as there are concerns that many taxpayers might escape the tax net due to the impending implementation of the new reassessment law on September 1, 2024.According to the amended regulation announced in Budget 2024 , the tax authorities can only go back a maximum of five years to reassess a taxpayer's records if the escaped income is at least Rs 50 lakh, and three years for an amount less than Rs 50 lakh.Previously, they could reassess cases up to 10 years old.According to an ET report, tax officials are now faced with the challenge of compiling and corroborating data on tax and income mismatches for the financial years 2013-14 to 2017-18 within the next few weeks, as these years will become time-barred for reassessment from September 1, 2024.The I-T department relies on information from various sources, such as banks, property registrars, and search findings from the investigation wing, to build reassessment cases.A tax officers' body has raised concerns about the feasibility of issuing notices under Section 148 (or 148A) in a large number of cases within a single month, given the overburdened nature of the jurisdictional assessing officers and the time-consuming process of obtaining sanction from the chief commissioner, who is the specified authority for such notices.Moreover, the law provides taxpayers with the right to explain their position before reassessment orders are finalized, a process that most believe cannot be completed by the end of August.Also Read | ITR refund status for FY 2023-24: How to check income tax refund status online - here’s a step-by-step guide for incometax.gov.in & NSDL websites The Central Board of Direct Taxes ( CBDT ) has been urged by its officers to postpone the effective date of the proposed amendment. However, this suggestion is unlikely to be well-received by corporations and high net worth individuals.""Capping the reassessment period at five years was a great decision as it would reduce hassles and litigation. But if the department fears there could be a genuine loss of revenue as it may not be possible to wrap up several matters by August 31, the government can think of strict parameters where time-bound cases can be selectively reopened - based on trails of steps taken in identifying escaped income,"" said Mitil Chokshi, partner at CA firm Chokshi & Chokshi.""Taxpayers may expect a rush of reassessment notices in August 2024. These notices are likely to be for the AYs 2018-19 and prior to that. It is pertinent to note that the Bombay High Court in a recent ruling in a case of Hexaware Technologies has taken a view on a proviso introduced in 2021, which can be interpreted to mean that AY 2017-18 (and prior years) got time barred on March 31, 2024. These reassessment notices (for AYs 2017-18 and prior) are likely to rake up new interpretation issues in the already muddled reassessment provisions,"" said Ashish Mehta, partner at law firm Khaitan & Co.The current situation is similar to the conflict between the Income Tax office and taxpayers in 2021. The reassessment law was amended in April 2021, allowing the tax office to reopen 10-year-old tax returns if the total undisclosed income exceeded Rs 50 lakh and reassess 4-year-old matters if the amount was less than Rs 50 lakh.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? However, this change led to over 10,000 writ petitions being filed by companies, arguing that they were not given sufficient time to explain and that the notices were issued without considering the carve-out that cases which couldn't be reopened earlier couldn't be reassessed under the new law.The Supreme Court invoked its extraordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution on May 4, 2022, to uphold all reassessment notices issued after March 31, 2021. However, the court left room for judicial proceedings based on the merits of each case, and several such matters are currently pending before the court.","The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month.

Are NPS Vatsalya & hiked NPS deduction limit for private sector employees good moves from Budget 2024?

NPS and EPF: Overlapping services

What is NPS Vatsalaya?

Latest NPS rules, news: In the Union Budget 2024 speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced two new initiatives with regard to National Pension Scheme (NPS) - extension of NPS 14% employer contribution benefits to private setcor and the intended launch of NPS Vatsalya.Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries, bringing it at par with the provisions available for government employees.Sriram Iyer, CEO, HDFC Pension Management told ET that with this move the “ground rules have been harmonised among government and non-government employees, which is a positive step.”Effectively, this means that now, private-sector employees can choose to reduce the taxable portion of employers’ contribution to their NPS corpus, thereby paying less tax and leaving greater funds in their pension deposits.“Employees will benefit from tax savings . More importantly, the 40% increase in contribution will have a significant impact on the terminal value of the retirement corpus,” remarked Iyer. The extended savings will “help in retirement planning, working as an option that is at par with the Provident Fund,” Dinesh Rohira, CEO & Founder, 5nance.com was quoted as saying.Moreover, the endeavour aims to increase NPS penetration by increasing tax incentives for the private sector, providing them a social security-cushion post-retirement.The scheme’s motive to widen the NPS subscriber base may not prove to be flawlessly effective, however. This is explained by Agrees Mrin Agarwal, Founder, Finsafe India: “While it’s good that the limit has been raised, it may not increase adoption as employees need to be educated in a big way. Also, the benefit is only for the salaried opting for the new tax regime,” she says.The mandatory contribution to the EPF, too, threatens to relegate the provisions of NPS under the umbrella of near-superfluity. This sentiment is echoed by Varun Sahay, a software engineer in a Delhi-based IT company: “When 12% of my salary is already deducted for the EPF, why should I put in more in the NPS and cut my take-home pay?”Rohira feels otherwise. “There’s no competition between the NPS and EPF as employees can contribute to both and build a 3-4 times bigger corpus while earning 3-4% higher returns via marketlinked options in the NPS,” he counters.Also Check | New Tax Regime 2023 vs 2024 After Budget: How Much Income Tax Will Salaried Taxpayers Save & How Do New Tax Slabs Compare To Old Regime? Top 10 Points You Must Know To jumpstart retirement savings for children, a new initiative called NPS Vatsalya has been unveiled in the Budget. This scheme allows parents and guardians to contribute to a minor's account, which can be converted into a regular NPS account once the child reaches adulthood.""It provides a very long duration for reaping the compounding benefits and accumulating a huge bounty at a later age. This can be a good way to plan a better future for kids who may not opt for a service segment in the future,"" says Rohira. Sriram Iyer agrees, stating, ""It’s a good move to help the child start his retirement journey. Even if a parent starts when the child is 10 years old, by the time he starts working, it can be a solid foundation for the compounding journey after that.""However, some experts question the utility of a product with such a long lock-in period, especially when parents cannot use the funds for essential goals like their child’s education amidst soaring education costs of 11-12%.""Parents are struggling to save for their own retirement, so it might be a bit of a stretch to expect them to save for their kids’ retirement. The need of the hour is a market-linked product that allows withdrawals only for the child’s education,"" says Mrin Agarwal, Founder of Finsafe India.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? Though the NPS permits partial withdrawals, it allows only 25% of the corpus after three years of joining, and this can be done only three times during the entire tenure. A premature exit before 60 years with 100% withdrawal is only possible if the corpus is less than Rs.2.5 lakh, an amount insufficient for most children's goals.""In its current form, there won’t be any uptake,"" asserts Agarwal. Rohira concurs, ""It’s a vanilla product with a lock-in, which does not make it very attractive and it may not take off. However, the government may optimise it and introduce new features later."" Iyer adds, ""This is just a start and there may be more subscriber-friendly features as we take it to the market. The regulator is proactive and open to feedback.""","Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries.

Gold import duty cut: Why Indians may not find buying gold from Dubai as attractive post Budget 2024,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-import-duty-cut-why-indians-may-not-find-buying-gold-from-dubai-as-attractive-post-budget-2024/articleshow/112097671.cms,"Gold import duty cut in Budget 2024: The recent reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai. Indian jewellers with stores in both India and the UAE believe that the narrowed duty differential will result in lower gold prices in India, making it less attractive for Indians to purchase gold in Dubai.The emirate had attracted gold-enthusiast Indians following a steep rise in customs duty in India in July 2022. In the fiscal 2024-25 budget, the duty on gold imports was more than halved.The duty cut is also expected to boost gold jewellery production in India, particularly the popular 'Kolkatti' jewellery from Kolkata, which is favored by Indian expats in Dubai and tourists from various countries. This move will encourage gold artisans to create new designs in both heavyweight and lightweight jewellery, attracting consumers to purchase gold from India.According to an ET report, Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group , estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India as Indian tourists who previously bought jewellery in Dubai will now prefer to shop in India. However, Indian expats living in Dubai and other customers may continue to buy from the UAE.Also Read | Gold losing sheen? Government cuts gold bond issuance target as investors look at better alternatives Rajiv Popley, director at Popley & Sons, believes that the perception of overseas gold being cheaper than in India is merely a mindset. He points out that the labour cost is significantly lower in India, and with the introduction of mandatory hallmarking and HUID numbers, the purity of gold in India is no longer a concern.Furthermore, NRIs in Dubai do not receive VAT refunds, and Indians travelling abroad only receive about 60% of the VAT back on their gold purchases. Gold trade analyst Bhargav Baidya suggests that the 1% duty differential between gold jewellery in India and Dubai will be offset by Indian jewellers offering discounts to retain and attract customers.Saurabh Gadgil, chairman of PNG Jewellers, notes that Indian import duty is now on par with the US, allowing Indian jewellers to offer competitive prices compared to other countries worldwide. The reduced customs duty is expected to make gold purchases in India more attractive and convenient for Indian consumers, potentially leading to a significant shift in their gold shopping preferences.",The reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai.

Gold losing sheen? The government has reduced its target for issuing gold bonds in the financial year 2024-25 by 38% compared to the previous interim budget goal, according to a senior official. The revised target stands at Rs 18,500 crore, down from Rs 29,638 crore estimated in the interim budget and Rs 26,852 crore (revised estimate) in 2023-24.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told ET ""The decision followed a reassessment of various factors, including investor demand, other investment products and uncertainties around the global economy, as the situation has changed since the interim budget in February.""After accounting for redemptions, the net issuances of sovereign gold bonds are now estimated at Rs 15,000 crore for this fiscal year, a significant decrease from the Rs 26,138 crore projected in the interim budget and Rs 25,352 crore in the revised estimate for 2023-24.Harish Galipelli, director at ILA Commodities India, attributed this shift to retail investors increasingly opting for equities in anticipation of better returns. He also noted that people are uncertain about the potential for further increases in gold prices in the short-to-medium term following a recent rally. Additionally, Galipelli pointed out that savings in rural areas have been impacted by retail inflation and other factors.The gold bond and gold monetisation schemes were introduced by the government in late 2015 to discourage the physical purchase of precious metals and reduce imports, thereby mitigating the negative impact on the current account deficit.The gross collection through these two schemes is now projected to be Rs 20,030 crore in 2024-25, compared to Rs 31,168 crore in the interim budget and Rs 28,240 crore (revised estimate) in the previous fiscal year. Similarly, the net collection is estimated at Rs 16,433 crore, down from Rs 27,571 crore in the interim budget and Rs 26,653 crore in the previous year. However, the estimates for the gold monetisation scheme remain unchanged from the interim budget level.Also Read | Budget 2024: Duty cuts on gold, silver, platinum, and diamonds to make jewellery more affordable The sovereign gold bond scheme targets investors who view gold as an investment, encouraging them to purchase paper gold instead of physical gold.On the other hand, the gold monetisation scheme aims to bring out idle gold held by households, temple trusts, and others to increase domestic supply. Both schemes were designed to curb gold imports, which, along with crude oil, have been significant contributors to India's current account deficit.

KOLKATA: A Kolkata Police civic volunteer, Sanjay Roy , was taken into custody on Saturday in connection with the brutal rape and murder of a second-year postgraduate trainee doctor at RG Kar Hospital . The arrest came just six hours after the police force had formed a seven-member Special Investigation Team (SIT) to look into the case.On Sunday, investigators discovered the most compelling evidence against Sanjay Roy, the prime suspect in the rape and murder of the 31-year-old doctor.Traces of blood and skin found under the victim's fingernails perfectly matched Roy's DNA and corresponded to the injuries he sustained during the attack, said a senior cop.According to a senior police officer, the victim, despite being half-asleep, had put up a desperate fight against her attacker, and it was this struggle that provided investigators with the crucial evidence they needed to link Roy to the crime.The murder has triggered widespread outrage with doctors and nurses protesting in Kolkata and other parts of India.

What does this leadership change mean for Starbucks' future?

Starbucks on Tuesday made headlines with a surprising leadership change, announcing the appointment of Brian Niccol , the CEO of Chipotle Mexican Grill, as its new CEO. This decision comes after Laxman Narasimhan 's brief 18-month tenure, during which Starbucks faced declining sales and increasing pressure from activist investors. The move sent Starbucks' shares soaring, reflecting investor optimism about Niccol's potential to steer the company through its current challenges.Niccol is recognized for his successful turnaround of Chipotle, where he doubled the company's sales and significantly boosted its stock value.His track record of innovation and growth at Chipotle, particularly in overcoming significant reputational challenges, is seen as a major asset as he steps into his new role at Starbucks. With Starbucks facing declining demand in key markets and pressure to improve its business, Niccol's appointment is viewed as a ""transformational step forward"" by stakeholders, including activist investor Elliott Investment Management.Brian Niccol is the newly appointed CEO of Starbucks, previously serving as the CEO of Chipotle Mexican Grill since 2018. He is credited with reviving Chipotle by doubling its sales and tripling its stock value. Niccol has also held leadership roles at Taco Bell and Procter & Gamble. His experience in leading successful turnarounds and driving growth in the fast-food industry makes him a significant addition to Starbucks' leadership team.Starbucks appointed Niccol in response to declining sales and increased pressure from activist investors like Elliott Investment Management. Niccol's proven ability to drive innovation and growth at Chipotle, along with his experience in overcoming operational challenges, positioned him as an ideal candidate to lead Starbucks through its current difficulties. According to Thomas Hayes, chairman at Great Hill Capital, Niccol ""is going to turn the company around.""Niccol will have to address several key challenges at Starbucks, including declining sales in the U.S. and China, competition from other coffee brands, and pressure from activist investors to improve the company’s performance. Starbucks has also been struggling with a weakening store experience and a lack of innovation, which contributed to its recent downturn. Additionally, Niccol will need to manage ongoing contract negotiations with unionized stores, a departure from Starbucks’ previous stance under former CEO Howard Schultz.The reaction from Wall Street has been overwhelmingly positive. Starbucks shares surged as much as 23.7% following the announcement, reflecting investor confidence in Niccol's ability to turn the company around. In contrast, Chipotle's shares fell by about 14%, likely due to concerns about the impact of Niccol's departure. Analysts have praised the move, with Andrew Charles of TD Cowen stating that Starbucks ""picks up a hall-of-fame restaurant CEO,"" signaling a new era for the company.During his tenure at Chipotle, Niccol was instrumental in doubling the company’s sales to approximately $10 billion in fiscal 2023 and more than tripling its stock value. He also led a successful turnaround following a series of food safety issues by implementing new safety protocols and expanding the company’s digital and delivery capabilities. His leadership in these areas is expected to bring valuable insights to Starbucks as it seeks to enhance its own operations and customer experience.Niccol’s appointment marks a significant shift for Starbucks, as the company looks to rejuvenate its brand and business operations. With Niccol at the helm, there is optimism that Starbucks will regain its footing in the market. As analyst David Palmer noted, Niccol ""has the gravitas to address the Howard Schultz Founder 'overhang',"" suggesting that his leadership could help move the company beyond its recent struggles and into a period of renewed growth and innovation.(With inputs from agencies)","Brian Niccol is the newly appointed CEO of Starbucks.

Starbucks: Starbucks ousts CEO Laxman Narasimhan for Chipotle replacement,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/starbucks-ousts-ceo-laxman-narasimhan-for-chipotle-replacement/articleshow/112502402.cms,"WASHINGTON: Satya Nadella has taken Microsoft to dizzying heights and Sundar Pichai hasn't done too badly with Alphabet/Google either. From FedEx CEO (Raj Subramanium) to the CEO of grocery chain Albertsons (Vivek Sankaran), Indian-American success in c-suites beyond tech companies is the stuff of lore.But in a rare setback to the story, Starbucks announced on Tuesday that it is replacing its CEO Laxman Narasimhan after only 16 months at the helm, after indicating he failed to arrest the beverage chain's flagging sales.Investor activism and disappointment at Narasimhan's performance on part of Starbucks' chairman emeritus Howard Schultz , who handpicked him as CEO, are reasons being attributed for the ouster.Narasimhan will be leaving immediately and be succeeded by Chipotle CEO Brian Nichol , the company said in a statement.The Pune-born Narasimhan joined Seattle-headquartered Starbucks as CEO and moved from London, where he was previously CEO of the consumer goods company Reckitt Benckiser. His taking over came with slowing sales at Starbucks' primary markets, US and China, which he could not staunch, despite, according to one account, the six months he spent learning about Starbucks’ business, including training as a barista. Starbucks' stock dropped more than 20 per cent during his leadership.Meanwhile, Chipotle has been on a tear since Nichol's took over in 2018 after previously helming Taco Bell and Pizza Hut. It's stock has soared more than 700 per cent under him as US customers have begun to disdain vanity drinks for more essential food during inflationary times.In a typical pro-forma statement, Starbucks' board thanked Narasimhan for his services, saying, “In the face of some challenging headwinds, Laxman has been laser focused on improving the business to meet the needs of our customers and partners. We all wish him the very best and know he will do great things in the future.”",Laxman Narasimhan will be succeeded by Chipotle CEO Brian Nichol.

"F1 spikes demand for travel to Singapore, Abu Dhabi, says travel company",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/f1-spikes-demand-for-travel-to-singapore-abu-dhabi-says-travel-company/articleshow/112475266.cms,"MUMBAI: While the Olympics has wrapped up, sports tourism involving outbound travel from India has only got going with enthusiasts already booking the next round of trips to Singapore and Abu Dhabi for the Formula 1 Grand Prix races to be held in September and December respectively. Airfares to these countries for travel around the time of these races have gone up, said a travel search aggregator.The F1 races are scheduled to be held in Singapore from Sept 20 to 22 and in Abu Dhabi from Dec 6 to 8.“The excitement is palpable, with a surge in searches for these high-octane destinations. Our data reveals a staggering 189% increase in flight bookings for Singapore for the date of September 18 September compared to September 17, suggesting Indian fans are eager to soak up the pre-race atmosphere in Singapore,” said Skyscanner. The Singapore Grand Prix, to be held in the evening of Sunday Sept 22 takes place over 62 laps of the 4.94 km Marina Bay Street Circuit.For Abu Dhabi, the action heats up on December 2, with flight bookings jumping 188% compared to the previous day, it added. “It seems many Indian fans are keen to arrive early and gear up for the festivities. Interestingly, there is another spike of 167% in volume of flight bookings for the outbound date of December 07 compared to the previous day, indicating that some fans might be timing their visit to catch the heart-pounding climax of the 2024 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix,” it added.TOI looked at fares on Skyscanner for travel on Sept 22, the day of the race. From Mumbai, the cheapest one-way ticket on non-stop flight was priced at Rs 12172 for a Vistara flight that landed at 9.15 am. But from Delhi, no tickets were available on flights that landed in the morning or early afternoon in time to catch the race which begins at 5.30 pm. For travel a day earlier, on Saturday, Sept 21, the cheapest one-way fare was a Vistara fare on a flight which departs at 11.45 pm and lands in Singapore at 8.15 am (all local times).Giving tips to bag cheap fares, Skyscanner said: “To maximize your savings, you could also consider mixing and matching the airlines and airports you choose to fly with to and from, to seriously cut costs.

Nathan Anderson: Who is Nathan Anderson? Financial sleuth behind Hindenburg research,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/who-is-nathan-anderson-financial-sleuth-behind-hindenburg-research/articleshow/112423390.cms,"Nathan Anderson is the founder of Hindenburg Research, a New York-based forensic financial research firm that specialises in exposing corporate fraud and malpractices. Founded in 2017, Hindenburg Research has gained prominence for its detailed reports on publicly traded companies, often leading to significant declines in their stock prices .Hindenburg Research’s methodology uses fundamental analysis to aid their investment decision-making .They investigate companies that have accounting irregularities, bad actors in management or key service provider roles, undisclosed related-party transactions, illegal/unethical business or financial reporting practices, and undisclosed regulatory, product, or financial issues.The firm is named after the Hindenburg disaster of 1937, symbolizing Anderson’s mission to expose financial “disasters” before they can harm investors.One of Anderson’s most notable reports targeted Nikola Corporation , an electric vehicle startup , in September 2020. Hindenburg accused Nikola of deceiving investors about its technology and capabilities. The report led to a sharp decline in Nikola’s stock value and investigations by federal authorities, including the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).Anderson’s work has drawn both praise and criticism. While many investors and market observers commend his efforts to bring transparency to the financial markets, critics argue that Hindenburg’s short-selling strategy, where the firm profits from a company’s stock price decline following a negative report, raises ethical concerns.Companies targeted by Hindenburg have sometimes responded with legal action, accusing the firm of defamation and market manipulation.Despite the controversies, Anderson continues to be a key figure in financial investigations. His reports have sparked regulatory scrutiny and prompted companies to improve their transparency and corporate governance. Through Hindenburg Research, Anderson has significantly influenced how corporate fraud is identified and addressed in the financial markets.Last year, Hindenburg published a report on the Adani group alleging that the group was involved in stock manipulation and accounting fraud, leading to a massive plunge in Adani’s stock value and triggering regulatory scrutiny across multiple jurisdictions.Meanwhile, Hindenburg on Saturday posted on social media platform X that, ‘Something big soon India’, which has again raised speculations in the Indian market.","Nathan Anderson is the founder of Hindenburg Research, a New York-based forensic financial research firm that specialises in exposing corporate fraud and malpractices.

Hotels and airlines, such as Air France, also reported a decline in bookings.Additionally, the Banque de France acknowledged the uncertainty surrounding its forecast, stating that the positive effect from the Games is countered by the negative impact of the unclear political situation following the inconclusive parliamentary elections in June and July.","French economy is expected to boost from the Olympic and Paralympic Games, according to the French central bank Banque de France.

"Colin Huang, Temu owner’s billionaire founder, becomes China’s richest person",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/colin-huang-temu-owners-billionaire-founder-becomes-chinas-richest-person/articleshow/112391434.cms,"Math Prodigy

Temu Time

Punishing Hours

After several moderately successful ventures in gaming and e-commerce, Colin Huang got sick and retired. At one point, the young entrepreneur stayed home for a year thinking about his next move.The former Google engineer eventually started Pinduoduo , an e-commerce platform known for selling dirt-cheap products with massive promotions, in 2015. He quickly ascended the ranks of the world’s richest people, with his net worth peaking at $71.5 billion in early 2021.Like many so-called Covid billionaires, his fortune collapsed just as fast as it was made, tumbling 87% in the span of about a year.Huang’s decline was especially stark as the slowing global pandemic coincided with China’s abrupt crackdown on the country’s private sector.Then something surprising happened: Huang’s PDD Holdings Inc staged a comeback. Not as big as before, but steady, with its expansion outside of China under the Temu brand name helping counteract a persistently weak domestic economy.As a result, Huang, now 44, has become China’s richest person, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. With a $48.6 billion fortune, he displaces Zhong Shanshan, the country’s bottled-water king who has held the top spot since April 2021.Huang’s remarkable ascent has been fueled by China’s changing shopping habits after the nation’s real estate crisis morphed into a prolonged slowdown. He’s also the first tech tycoon to top the wealth rankings in more than three years, after government pressure on private businesses ensnared rivals like Jack Ma’s Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. Along the way, Huang has also drawn protests from suppliers for driving down prices and set a punishing work schedule for his own employees.“Ma and Jeff Bezos have been corporate leaders in their moments, but the times have changed and Huang is seeing great success with a different, less visible approach,” said Brock Silvers, managing director at private equity firm Kaiyuan Capital.Representatives for PDD didn’t respond to requests for comment.Unlike Ma, the English teacher-turned-founder of Alibaba, Huang represents a new generation of Chinese tech entrepreneurs who started their careers with global opportunities.At 12, his prodigious math talent earned him a place at the elite Hangzhou Foreign Languages School, where he was classmates with the children of China’s political and social elite. After graduating with a computer science degree from Zhejiang University, he left China in 2002 to pursue a master’s degree at the University of Wisconsin.Two years after graduating, he moved back to help set up Google China. He founded his first company in 2007, then sold it in 2010 to start a new one that helped companies market themselves on websites like Alibaba’s Taobao or JD.com. When an ear infection led him to retire in 2013, he hatched the idea for Pinduoduo.PDD “is not about letting people in Shanghai feel like they are living a Parisian life, but making sure that people in Anhui have kitchen paper and fresh fruits,” Huang said in 2018 interview with Caijing magazine. “The goal is not to be cheap, but to make users feel like they got a good deal.”Huang has mainly stayed out of the limelight after he stepped down as PDD’s chief executive in 2020 and left the board as chairman in 2021, as Beijing began cracking down on China’s tech giants. (He said he was pursuing personal interests researching food and life sciences, according to a shareholder letter.)It was around that time that PDD — and his net worth — started to tumble.But Temu, PDD’s offering outside of China, bolstered the company’s top line and underpinned its rebound. It surged to the top of US app stores upon launching in September 2022, targeting inflation-weary Americans with cheap, unbranded products shipped directly from China. PDD reported about 248 billion yuan ($35 billion) in revenue last year, a 90% jump from 2022.“In this economic environment, obviously people are looking for great value for their money, people are looking for low prices,” said Neil Saunders, a retail analyst at GlobalData Retail. “So this is a time to shine for value retailers like Temu.”All that, along with China dropping its Covid-Zero policy in December 2022, has driven a surge in PDD’s valuation. In November, the company surpassed Alibaba for the first time to become China’s second-largest internet firm and the two rivals have been neck-and-neck since.Still, the breakneck growth has drawn scrutiny at home and abroad. Even after a probe into working conditions following the death of an employee in 2021, PDD continues to demand that employees work from 11am to 11pm, six days a week, plus overtime. It’s a variation of the industry’s “996” culture which companies like ByteDance Ltd. and Alibaba steered away from after Beijing’s regulatory scrutiny.Temu’s ultra-cheap offerings also led to growing frustration among some merchants and third-party sellers, who feel the e-commerce giant is increasingly squeezing them for revenue. Things came to a head in a series of public rallies this summer, when, in one case, hundreds of small suppliers yelled slogans outside a Temu office outpost in Guangzhou to protest against what they called unfair penalties the company is levying.Elsewhere, US small businesses have also noted Temu’s rapid growth. The company currently takes advantage of a trade loophole that allows for duty-free shipments up to $800 into the US, by sending small packages from its warehouse in China to individual Americans. Lobbyists are pushing for the threshold to be lowered to $10.Still, PDD has engaged in aggressive promotion campaigns, including spending millions on a 30-second Super Bowl advertisement for Temu. It also has catchy banners on its Temu website, including, among others: “Shop Like a Billionaire.”“Temu at the moment is all about growth,” Saunders said. “Attract people to the site, get them shopping. Then if they become more addicted, maybe then they start to be more tolerant if we push prices up a little bit. So I think for Temu it’s in a land grab era.”","Colin Huang, 44, has become China’s richest person, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

Cash cow

RIYADH: Saudi oil giant Aramco on Tuesday reported net profit of $29.07 billion in the second quarter, a slight drop from the same period last year as output remained subdued.The decrease of 3.4 percent ""mainly reflects the impact of lower crude oil volumes sold and weakening refining margins"", the company said in a statement posted to the Saudi stock exchange.Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest crude exporter, is currently producing roughly nine million barrels per day (bpd), well below its capacity of 12 million bpd.Production averaged 8.8 million bpd in June, Riyadh-based firm Jadwa Investment said last week.The relatively low figure reflects cuts dating back to October 2022, when the OPEC+ bloc of oil producers that Riyadh co-leads with Moscow announced it would reduce output by two million bpd to boost prices.In April 2023, several OPEC+ members announced they would further slash production by more than one million bpd, and in June 2023, Riyadh announced an additional voluntary cut of one million bpd.""Output will remain at similar levels until at least October"", at which point an OPEC+ agreement announced in June 2024 will allow ""for gradual monthly increases"", Jadwa said.Aramco is the jewel of the Saudi economy and the main source of revenue for Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's Vision 2030 reform agenda, which aims to set the Gulf kingdom up for a prosperous post-oil future.The firm's profits help allow Saudi Arabia to finance flagship projects including NEOM, the futuristic mega-city being built in the desert, a giant airport in Riyadh and major tourism and leisure developments.The IMF said in April that, at current production levels, Saudi Arabia's fiscal break-even oil price would be $96.2 per barrel in 2024.Brent, the international benchmark, was trading at $76.43 per barrel on Tuesday after Monday's global stock market rout fuelled by US recession fears.Yet Aramco chief executive Amin Nasser told reporters that Aramco was still ""positive about the outlook for global oil demand"", pointing to ""strong"" demand from China.""The market in my view is overreacting and the fundamentals do not support the drop in prices that we are witnessing today,"" Nasser said.""I think the market is reading too much into the short-term responses to the news coming from the US with regards to the number of jobs.""The government's stake in Aramco, one of the world's biggest companies by market capitalisation, is around 81.5 percent.Aramco's initial public offering in 2019, the biggest flotation in history, raised $29.4 billion, and a secondary offering this year of nearly 1.7 billion shares fetched $12.35 billion.Aramco announced last year it would start paying a performance-based dividend in addition to its base dividend.In May, the firm announced base dividend payouts for the first quarter totalling $20.3 billion and a performance-linked dividend distribution of $10.8 billion to be paid in the second quarter.Those payments will be extended for another quarter and Aramco ""expects to declare industry-leading dividends of $124.2 billion in 2024"", Tuesday's statement said.""We have delivered market-leading performance once again, with strong earnings and cash flows in the first half of the year,"" Nasser said.""Leveraging those strong earnings, we continued to deliver a base dividend that is sustainable and progressive.""Aramco reported record profits in 2022 after Russia's invasion of Ukraine sent oil prices soaring, allowing Saudi Arabia to record its first budget surplus in nearly a decade.But the cash cow saw its profits drop by a quarter last year because of lower oil prices and production cuts, and profits in the first quarter of this year were down 14.5 percent.In January, Aramco said it had been instructed to abandon a plan to increase production capacity to 13 million barrels per day, up from its current level of 12 million bpd.Analysts said the surprise announcement could reflect a lack of confidence in demand, although Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said it was motivated by the transition to cleaner fuels.Saudi Arabia has pledged to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2060, a statement that has drawn intense scepticism from environmental activists.Aramco has vowed to achieve ""operational net-zero"" carbon emissions by 2050, which does not include the emissions from customers burning its products.Nasser told reporters on Tuesday that oil and gas demand ""will not peak any time soon given the vital role that hydrocarbons continue to play in the global economy"".","Saudi oil giant Aramco on Tuesday reported net profit of $29.07 billion in the second quarter.
