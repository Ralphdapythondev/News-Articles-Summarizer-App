Why RBI is stocking up aggressively on gold reserves; central bank buys 1.5 times more gold in Jan-April than entire 2023,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-rbi-is-stocking-up-aggressively-on-gold-reserves-central-bank-buys-1-5-times-more-gold-in-jan-april-than-entire-2023/articleshow/110348249.cms,"RBI's Strategic Diversification

RBI stocks up gold reserves : From January to April 2024, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) added 24 tonnes of gold to its reserves, a strategic move to hedge against volatility amidst geopolitical tensions. This addition is significantly higher than the 16 tonnes added throughout 2023, as per the analysis of RBI data.According to an ET report, as of April 26, 2024, the RBI held 827.69 tonnes of gold as part of its foreign exchange reserves , an increase from 803.6 tonnes at the end of December.The increase in gold reserves is almost 1.5 times the volume added in the whole of 2023.Although India has been a major consumer of gold at the household level, the central bank has so far been less active in accumulating gold reserves. The RBI faced criticism in 1991 when it pledged a portion of its gold reserves during a foreign exchange crisis.RBI started adding to its stocks through market purchases from December 2017, with a more aggressive approach in 2022 and a resurgence in buying activity since January 2024.The share of gold in the total foreign exchange reserves rose from 7.75 per cent at the end of December 2023 to approximately 8.7 per cent by the end of April 2024. Along with the increase in volumes, the central bank is also benefiting from valuation gains due to the steady rise in gold prices.Like many other emerging market central banks, the RBI is diversifying its reserves to hedge against currency volatility.""The heightened global uncertainty is sending emerging market central banks on a spree of gold buying, adding 290 tonnes in the first quarter of 2024 and accounting for a quarter of overall global gold demand,"" according to an assessment of the state of the economy by RBI economists published in its latest monthly bulletin.""Amid geopolitical developments and a slowing global economy, these central banks are signaling that living in challenging times calls for strategic diversification,"" it added.Gold's long-standing credential as a ""store of value"" asset is particularly relevant in the current context. ""Last year central banks placed great emphasis on gold's value in crisis response, diversification attributes and store-of-value credentials,"" said a senior analyst at the World Gold Council in a note. ""A few months into 2024, the world seems no less uncertain, meaning those reasons for owning gold are as relevant as ever.""","From January to April 2024, the Reserve Bank of India added 24 tonnes of gold to its reserves.

Nifty50 ended the day at 22,967.65, up 370 points or 1.64%.At the start of the trading day, investors considered the perspectives of two influential central bankers: Jerome Powell, the head of the US Federal Reserve, and Shaktikanta Das, the Governor of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).The bulls, disregarding the Fed officials' worries about the lack of progress in curbing inflation, as indicated in the Fed minutes, chose to concentrate on the substantial dividend of Rs 2.1 lakh crore declared by the RBI for the government, according to an ET analysis.Consequently, the Sensex surged and reached a new record high, while the Nifty also experienced an over 1% rally, surpassing the 22,900 level and setting a new all-time high.""The higher-than-budgeted RBI surplus transfer would help to boost the government of India's resource envelope in FY2025, allowing for enhanced expenditures or a sharper fiscal consolidation than what was pencilled into the Interim Budget for FY2025. Increasing the funds available for capex would certainly boost the quality of the fiscal deficit,"" ICRA's chief economist Aditi Nayar said.The unexpected revenue windfall, amounting to approximately 0.4% of the GDP, is regarded as a significant macroeconomic positive for the market, directly impacting the fiscal deficit and bond yields.""The infusion of funds is akin to an indirect rate cut for the economy, as it is expected to lead to a reduction in bond yields. Since many investment instruments are linked to government bond yields, this reduction will likely have a broad positive impact across the financial markets. The improved fiscal position could also prompt upgrades in India's economic outlook,"" said Santosh Meena, Head of Research at Swastika Investmart.Economists suggest that the government has the option to allocate the entire windfall, either equally or disproportionately, between revenue and capital expenditure without modifying the fiscal deficit/GDP target.Alternatively, they could partially spend the bonanza and use the remaining portion to decrease market borrowings and fiscal deficit, according to Madhavi Arora, Lead Economist at Emkay Global.Arora stated, ""Either way, this bonanza will lead to fall across the sovereign and corporate cost curves and should help keep upward momentum in the bond market. Bull steepening trade is making a comeback in the near-term, especially as easier liquidity in the order.""The RBI's decision has the potential to assist the government in reducing its fiscal deficit and increasing infrastructure investment. Dr V K Vijayakumar of Geojit Financial Services explained, ""The bond yields have declined sharply reflecting lower borrowing by the government. Decline in bond yields is positive for banking stocks.""The Nifty Bank index outperformed, rising 1.6%, while PSU rail and defence stocks increased in anticipation of higher capex push. GRSE, Cochin Shipyard, and Mazagon Dock saw rallies of up to 20%, and PSU rail stocks like RVNL and IRFC traded 7-8% higher.Despite persistent selling by FIIs in the cash market, analysts anticipate that foreigners may start buying, providing additional support to the market. Meena predicts that the Nifty may experience further growth, with an immediate target of 23,000 and the possibility of reaching 24,000 as the election outcome approaches. However, while large-cap stocks are expected to perform well, mid-cap and small-cap stocks may underperform from this point forward.","BSE Sensex, hit a lifetime high of almost 75,500, Nifty50 touched just short of 23,000 level.

SEC opens the door for spot ether ETFs in big crypto victory,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/sec-opens-the-door-for-spot-ether-etfs-in-big-crypto-victory/articleshow/110378077.cms,"Significant victory

Crypto crackdown

The Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday paved the way for trading in exchange-traded funds that invest directly in the cryptocurrency Ether , putting the digital-asset industry on the cusp of a significant milestone.In a first-of-its-kind blessing, the SEC signed off on a proposal by venues run by Cboe Global Markets Inc., Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange to list products tied to the world’s second-biggest cryptocurrency. The move, which had seemed unlikely as recently as last week, removes a key hurdle for spot Ether ETF trading in the US. Issuers now need a separate sign-off from the regulator; no deadline has been set for that decision.Investment companies, including VanEck, ARK Investment Management, BlackRock Inc., and Fidelity Investments, are all vying for crucial first-mover advantage in the race to launch a spot Ether ETF. Their interest has been piqued by billions of dollars gushing into new Bitcoin ETFs since January when the SEC signed off on trading in those products.Shares of Coinbase gained as much as 4.1% in after-hours trading Thursday, while Robinhood shares rose nearly 3%. The crypto market response to the news was relatively muted - Ether traded around $3819.80 in the immediate aftermath of the releaseBeyond ETFs, the SEC’s announcement on Thursday is laced with US financial policy implications.SEC Chair Gary Gensler has been ambiguous on his views over whether Ether is a security, stoking concerns that the agency was hardening its stance. Crypto enthusiasts say they are worried about him trying to subject Ether — and potentially projects based on the Ethereum blockchain — to the agency’s tough, expensive and onerous investor-protection rules.Meanwhile, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the US’s other main market regulator with jurisdiction over derivatives, has signaled that it doesn’t consider Ether to be a security. The CFTC has for years allowed trading in Ether futures by CME Group Inc.As recently as last week, companies were banking the SEC would reject the Cboe plan — and potentially others — by Thursday’s deadline. Additional SEC approval is still needed for the issuers, but the signoff is a significant victory for the industry.Backers hope a listing will bring a new flood of money to the asset class by appealing to retail and institutional investors, who are interested in crypto but more comfortable investing in ETFs than tokens.Overall, investors, many who retreated after FTX exchange’s collapse, have already been piling back into crypto. Ether, the native token of the Ethereum blockchain, is up more than 60% this year alone thanks to the frenzy.Some of that rally is due to optimism that the US crackdown on the industry may be waning. The Republican-led House on Wednesday advanced sweeping cryptocurrency legislation despite opposition from the White House and Gensler. Although the Senate isn’t expected to approve the measure, it garnered some Democratic support in the House.On the jurisdictional question, Lee Reiners, policy director of the Duke Financial Economics Center at Duke University, said that exchange bids to list the products were based on Ether being a commodity and not a security. An SEC decision to green light the plan bolsters the view that the SEC still considers Ether not to be a security, he said.Investment companies seeking to list the products have already been making concessions to win SEC approval.Fidelity Investments said it will keep Ether it buys as part of the ETF out of programs that pay rewards for blockchain maintenance, known as staking. The latter has been a hot-button issue for Ether because it raises questions about whether the token should be treated as a security. Last year, the SEC in a lawsuit accused Coinbase Global Inc. of breaking its rules by offering staking services.",The Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday paved the way for trading in exchange-traded funds that invest directly in the cryptocurrency Ether.

The finance minister set the stage for a ""Viksit Bharat by 2047"", on the core principles of ‘Sabka Saath’, ‘Sabka Vikas’, ‘Sabka Vishwas’, with ‘Sabka Prayas’ being added as a new theme in the interim Budget.This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data i.e., farmer welfare and N for Nari utthan i.e., support for women entrepreneurs.These form the pillars of a comprehensive inclusive development. The Government's commitment to sustainable development under the strategy for Amrit Kaal includes achieving 'Net Zero' by 2070, rooftop solarization for one crore households and robust health initiatives.The Indian economy's resilience takes center stage amidst positive indicators of declining current account deficit as a percentage of GDP, falling unemployment rates, and a notable rise in digital transactions. These statistics affirm the robustness of the economy, showcasing a trajectory of growth and stability.The achievements in taxation reforms are nothing short of remarkable, with direct tax collections more than trebling in the last decade, the number of tax return filers increasing by 2.4 times, average processing time of tax returns plummeting from 93 days in FY 2013-14 to an impressive 10 days in FY 2023-24, resulting in issuance of quick refunds. These are the results of consistent progressive measures thus obviating the need for, and rightly avoiding, any last-minute populist measures.No change in existing tax rates, both for direct and indirect taxes, is a good indicator of stability and predictability for investors and taxpayers.A welcome move to waive outstanding tax demands that are minor, disputed, and unreconciled. This involves the withdrawal of outstanding direct tax demands up to Rs. 25,000 pertaining to the period up to FY 2009-10 and up to Rs.10,000 for FY 2010-11 to 2014-15.The Government's commitment to fostering a business-friendly environment is evident in its intent to extend specific tax benefits for start-ups, investments by sovereign wealth funds/ pension funds, and certain IFSC units. The extension has been made now until March 31, 2025. This might help in creating a conducive landscape for business.To align with the CBDT notification issued earlier, the provisions relating to tax collection at source concerning remittances under the Liberalized Remittance Scheme have now been formally incorporated in the Finance Bill, 2024, setting the rate at 20% for amounts exceeding Rs. 7 lakhs in a financial year.The Finance Bill, 2024 proposes an extension of the time limit for introducing the faceless scheme by the Central Government for transfer pricing proceedings, DRP Proceedings, and ITAT Proceedings, up to March 31, 2025.The interim Budget 2024 may not have proposed significant tax announcements, but it very well positioned the prelude to the full budget post the upcoming elections. Considering the potential impact on the population across the four pillars of GYAN, a sizable portion of India stands to be covered. The interim Budget’s focus on the tax front resembles a report card, highlighting the maturity achieved by our tax system. The enhancement of taxpayer services was emphasized as a key priority.","This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data and N for Nari utthan.

The Finance Minister on February 01, 2024, delivered a truly innovative interim budget. At first glance, it did not seem like an interim budget but looked more like the budget to drive further growth and a continuum of inclusive growth-oriented investments.At the outset, this budget brings a wonderful balance between fiscal prudence and continued investment for growth.It's not easy to continue the glide path of reducing the fiscal deficit and continuing to make significant investments in all areas including infrastructure, R&D, energy transition, technology, skilling, and social welfare. The surprising reduction in fiscal deficit of 5.8% as against the budgeted 5.9% for FY24 and the projection of 5.1% in FY25 with a clear focus on increasing investments was a huge positive.This was a budget for everyone and all because it caters to every part of the Indian economy and society. The FM has carefully catered to the investment needs of various sectors. The continued focus on youth, impoverished, women and farmers to increase their involvement and contribution to economic growth is evident. By committing an 11.1% increase in capital expenditure to 11,11,111 lakh crore, the FM has clearly brought every single 1 in this growth journey.What was very impressive was the inclusion strategy of the government. The focus on women's empowerment for the past few years is unprecedented, which is reflected in the inclusion of women in the workforce moving from 23.3% to 37% in the last five years. The thirty crore Mudra Yojna loans to women entrepreneurs were a great boost to the Nari Shakti initiative. We already have over 10 million Lakhpati Didis and what is truly evident is like a corporate CFO, the FM has revised the earlier target of 20 million Lakhpati Didis to 30 million. The government also plans to invest in initiatives to encourage young girls between the ages of 9 and 14 to undertake the vaccination for cervical cancer which is again a great boost to Nari Shakti.A lot needs to be done to bring more women into all parts of economic growth but the journey so far and the vision of the future is truly inspiring.While India continues on its technological prowess and makes its mark in new technologies like Artificial Intelligence, we need a multi-pronged strategy to harness the power of AI. We need a clear focus on building AI systems in India so that we not only emerge as a global leader in this new era but can build models, which are specific to India that will benefit Indians. At the same time, we need a very wide coverage program to build skills to leverage AI to its fullest potential. The biggest contribution we can make to the inclusion of youth in the economic development of the country is by skilling them in new skill areas. In the last few years, the Skill India Mission has trained 14 million youth, reskilled over 5 million youth and established a staggering 3,000 new ITIs. The future of any country will depend as much on capital investments as on skill investments.The focus on agricultural development and support to the farmer continues through direct financial assistance to farmers. The farmers have benefited by getting crop insurance through PM Fasal Bima Yojana. It's not just the farmers, the PM-SVANidhi provides credit assistance to a large number of street vendors.The last few years have seen the journey of affordable housing through Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY). There is a slight increase in allocation to launch a scheme for encouraging the middle class to build or buy new homes. This investment will likely propel a wider economic development and increase employment.India has seen a tremendous rise in entrepreneurship in the last few years. In order to continue the journey and promote new startups, the government proposes to extend certain tax benefits, which are expiring from March 2024 to March 2025. The MSMEs have not been left behind. With a proposal to provide timely finances to such enterprises, the government has paved the way for their growth, so they can look to compete globally.All in all, it’s a truly inclusive budget with a clear focus on development not just by giving away freebies but enabling the people to participate in the economic development activity. While the FM calls the comprehensive GDP - Governance, Development & Performance – to me, this budget is inclusive of another GDP – gender, demography, and professions.","Akhilesh Tuteja is Partner and Head, Clients and Markets, KPMG in India.

‘Enough domestic sources of demand to counter drag from external sector’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/enough-domestic-sources-of-demand-to-counter-drag-from-external-sector/articleshow/107372012.cms,"Do you think the

creates room for lower interest rates?

One of the issues that the Budget has flagged is the demographic challenge and opportunity and the societal change that is taking place. How do you view this?

Niti Aayog is working on the Viksit Bharat roadmap. What will be the focus areas?

You are as much a representative of the Centre as well as the states. Is it time to revisit the entire formula for transfers to states particularly on the issue of cesses and surcharges?

Suman Bery , who heads Niti Aayog , the govt think tank, is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China, which he says is also an opportunity for India. The economist is confident that Indian states remain resilient. Excerpts of the interview with TOI.The finance ministry expects the economy to grow 7% next year.Given the global situation, how do you see the prospects?The belief in the finance ministry is that we have a possible drag coming from the external sector but that we have other sources. We have enough domestic sources of demand. One has to applaud the political and economic judgment of FM in deciding that it was appropriate to pursue the path of fiscal consolidation. There is transparency. What this actually reflects is responsible economic management, which is one reason we are where we are. Second, it also creates a buffer so that there is policy space if we do encounter headwinds.That’s the hope and expectation. We have an independent central bank and an inflation targeting central bank, so it is up to the monetary policy committee to take a call through the monetary policy committee on the repo rate .The PM has said that when India grows its states grow. India is a composite of 37 states and UTs. They are each at very different points in their demographic transition. There are some states where the net replacement rate is down to 1%, like Kerala . There are others, particularly UP and Bihar, which are in their earliest stage of demographic transition and each one of these states is the size of a large European country. There are two implications of that — one is internal labour mobility and it will become an even larger part of our growth model. The govt has taken several steps to create a unified market. Our main endowment is our human capital and that has to be equipped to participate in global exchange in many ways. We know from China, Japan that the demographic dividend partly depends on markets and on human capital. But the golden period is fairly short lived, about 15 years, when the so called dependency ratio declines. The other big opportunity the PM has been highlighting is bringing women much more into the active labour force.When Niti was set up there was the idea of a three-year vision and a seven-year strategy paper. The reality is that schemes of govt tend to be aligned with the award of the Finance Commission . There are various established building blocks or hand holds which are already a matter of govt policy. The PM is much more interested in a national debate on what it means to be a Viksit Bharat or modern society. We have a collective goal and it is for the democratic polity to define what that goal should be. Its emphatically not for a super mandarin bureaucracy. It is not going to be Lee Kwan Yew’s Singapore led from the top.It’s entirely a finance ministry matter but I would be lying if I didn’t say when I visit certain states there is this complaint. A big frontier would be resource mobilisation at the state level. Second is going to be rationalisation of subsidies not only at the Union level, but also at the state level. All chief ministers sit on my governing council. When they convene as the governing council, I see them in their role as development practitioners. The world is beginning to appreciate quite how much institutional and political maturity India attained in our 75 years and the most fundamental dimension of a democracy, we have orderly transfers of power. There are enough buffers to ensure that what happens in state finances is unlikely to create macro instability. Those risks are well contained by our Constitution. The chief ministers know that they are going to be judged by development outcomes and so you can have the sugar rush of changing of pension plans or various handouts but if the cupboard is bare you are not going to be able to deliver.","Suman Bery is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China.

Government's Marathon to 2047: Emphasis on Fiscal Prudence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/governments-marathon-to-2047-emphasis-on-fiscal-prudence/articleshow/107371788.cms,"What was the thinking behind keeping the vote on account absolutely straight?

So is it the idea to keep the Budget completely transparent?

The capex has risen 11.1% and there is an emphasis on infrastructure spending. But there is also the hope that the private sector will now take over and start capital spending. Given the geopolitical situation, how confident is the govt that it will pan out as planned?

Finance secretary T V Somanathan, in an interview with TOI, says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047 . Excerpts:If you see the Budget speech you will see the emphasis on 2047. The govt has set its sight on running that marathon.Running to 2047 is a marathon , it’s not a sprint. If you are going to run a marathon, you need to be in good shape and you can’t have short-term stimulants or something that will get you some yards and then it’s done.The whole focus is on making India a developed country by 2047, for which a healthy present and a strong fiscal position is an important concomitant. Some purely short term measures don’t really fit into that picture. It’s a consistent picture: focus on the long term for which you need to build strength in the short term and that needs to be done by prudence in fiscal policy and by not doing things which can detract you from that path. Not doing the wrong thing is more important than appearing to do things.The idea is that govt finances may be good, bad or indifferent depending on the times, depending on the circumstances, depending on the policies. But what is the position should be reflected as reasonably and accurately as possible. That is an emphasis. As regards the Finance Commission, again the terms of reference that have been given to them are the terms in the Constitution.What is the means by which the devolution should be done is a matter they have full discretion. They can actually take all kinds of factors into account and in a sense we felt this time based on my review of the previous commissions that the right expression would be less is more. The shorter, less prescriptive terms of reference gives full scope for all stakeholders including state govts to express their viewpoints and for the commission to take a balanced view of the different perspectives and then come to its award. Ultimately the award of the Finance Commission is about devolution and grant for which full scope has now been given to them.n There are incipient signs of private capital expenditure accelerating. There are some surveys I have seen done by some of the chambers industry, which show high levels of investment. The PMI, which is a sort of leading indicator, is also looking pretty healthy. Capacity utilisation is one reason that private sector capital expenditure doesn’t immediately pick up when the economy starts accelerating because there is surplus capacity.But increasingly I get the sense that many industries are beginning to reach levels where they have to add capacity. When that happens capital investment will happen. Another pointer also mentioned in the Budget speech you may notice that our airlines have placed large orders for planes — that is capital expenditure.When you import 1,000 aircraft, it’s just not 1,000 aircraft, there are concomitant additions to ground handling facilities, you need airports to expand, you need to employ people to do that. That means a lot of jobs. The aircraft is capital but then look at the effect it is going to have on skilled jobs. So capital expenditure is happening. I am fairly confident that we will have decent capital expenditure in the year to come and that will become a new source of acceleration.",Finance secretary T V Somanathan says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047.

What is the Section 80C limit for tax deduction for FY 2024-25 after Interim Budget 2024?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/income-tax-budget-2024-2024-2025-section-80c-limit-epf-ppf-elss-nsc/articleshow/107353021.cms,"ALSO READ |

Income Tax Changes Budget 2024 : In the recent Budget 2024 speech, the Finance Minister kept the Section 80C tax deduction limit unchanged. The maximum limit for claiming tax benefits under Section 80C remains at Rs 1.5 lakh for the current fiscal year 2023-24 and will stay the same for individuals looking to save on taxes through Section 80C investments in the upcoming fiscal year 2024-25.Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions. Individuals can reduce their gross taxable income by up to Rs 1.5 lakh per financial year by engaging in these specific investments or expenditures.You can save on taxes through Section 80C by investing in things like Employees' Provident Fund (EPF), Public Provident Fund (PPF), Equity Linked Saving Scheme (ELSS) mutual funds, National Savings Certificate (NSC), and 5-year tax-saving fixed deposits with banks or post offices. Additionally, paying life insurance policy premiums also qualifies for tax benefits under Section 80C.It is important to note that each eligible investment comes with its specific maximum limit, rate of return, liquidity, and taxation rules for the earned returns, states ET in a report. For instance, the most you can invest in PPF in a financial year is Rs 1.5 lakh. Meanwhile, there's no limit on the amount you can invest in ELSS mutual funds, but the Section 80C deduction is capped at Rs 1.5 lakh.If individuals can't make specific investments, they can still get deductions under Section 80C from their gross taxable income through certain expenses. These expenses include repaying the principal amount of a home loan, tuition fees for children, payment of stamp duty, registration fees, and other costs related to buying a house.Since the financial year 2020-21, individuals without any business income must annually choose between the old and new tax regimes. As of the fiscal year 2023-24, the new tax regime is the default option. Consequently, individuals seeking tax deductions under Section 80C must opt for the old tax regime since this deduction isn't available in the new tax regime. It's crucial for taxpayers to be aware of these rules to make informed decisions about their tax planning and investment strategies.","Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions.

Budget 2024 focuses on youth and women entrepreneurship,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/budget-2024-focuses-on-youth-and-women-entrepreneurship/articleshow/107357923.cms,"By

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget which is an interim budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year. The budget talks about inclusive development both, social and geographical, especially for youth, women, farmers, and the poor. Continued focus on improving logistics through infrastructure spend on roads, rail, airports, ports increases productivity for companies and citizens alike.To make ‘Viksit Bharat’ by 2047, the government’s focus is on improving and empowering people’s capabilities through various skilling initiatives. It is encouraging to see that Skill India Mission has succeeded in training more than 1.4 crore youth and upskilling and reskilling 54 lakh youth. I am particularly happy to see the continued focus on youth and women entrepreneurship and the announcement of a new fund which will give interest free 50 year loans for startups will provide a domestic fillip to startups supplementing venture capital we have traditionally relied on from abroad.PM Mudra Yojana has sanctioned 43 crore loans aggregating to 22.5 lakh crore to youth entrepreneurs and thirty crore Mudra Yojana loans to women entrepreneurs. There are several other schemes like Fund of Funds, Start-Up India, and Start-Up Credit Guarantee schemes that are assisting our youth. Further, the extension of tax benefits to Start-ups and investments made by sovereign wealth funds/pension funds, till 31st March 2025 depicts the government’s effort to support the startup eco- system.This aligns quite well with India Sanitation Coalition’s efforts to give impetus to the start-up world. Over the past 7 editions of our ISC-FICCI Sanitation Awards, we have recognized and promoted several start-ups in the sanitation space, many of whom are successful businesses now!While the finance minister did not provide detailed information on Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH), the budget allocation sees a slight increase in spend demonstrating continued focus on this highly successful program. The acknowledgement that the private sector has increasingly played a substantial role in addressing WASH issues in both urban and rural areas, with numerous projects underway through Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs), highlights the government's commitment to addressing challenges in this sector.A perfect example is the LightHouse Initiative initiated by the Department of Drinking Water along with the India Sanitation Coalition (ISC) by partnering with major corporates across India to develop model villages in Solid and Liquid Waste Management (SLWM) under SBM-Grameen. From this budget, there is an expectation that the government will persist in prioritizing Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) as the path toward achieving the country's Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6). Additionally, it is hoped that the government will uphold its commitment to making necessary infrastructural investments for SLWM.The budget speech rightly celebrates the fact that we have 83 lakh SHGs and 9 crore women beneficiaries. The microfinance movement in the country and the possibility of empowering women members of SHGs through livelihood skilling is a key to bringing women into mainstream economic advancement.The focus on green growth, rooftop solar, wind, biomass, e-vehicles all help with our green energy thrust. The tourism sector was mentioned and could be a huge job provider for youth and women.Guided by the principle ‘Reform, Perform, and Transform’, the budget emphasizes efficient implementation of various policies by improving coordination with states and relevant stakeholders. This is critical both for infra spend and social programsIt is noteworthy that ISC’s Climate Resilient Coastal Cities project which is being implemented in PPP (Public-Private Partnership) mode in four coastal states of Karnataka, Gujarat, Goa and Maharashtra is congruent with the government’s priority of promoting climate-resilient activities for the blue economy 2.0, a scheme for restoration and adaptation measures, and coastal aquaculture.The budget also focuses on the Aspirational districts program where assistance will be given to the states for faster development of aspirational districts and blocks, including the generation of ample economic opportunities. This is again very crucial as it has a huge potential to transform the landscape of our country while making sure no -one is left behind.Overall, this budget has embraced economic strategies and develops the building blocks that nurture and uphold growth, promote inclusive and sustainable development, and enhance productivity.","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year.

MUMBAI: Sensex and Nifty, the two leading indices, hit new all-time highs in late trades on Thursday as RBI's record Rs 2.1 lakh crore dividend payment to the govt boosted investor sentiment on Dalal Street.

Former Wipro CEO Delaporte got $20M as salary; highest paid Indian IT CEO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/ex-wipro-ceo-delaportes-fy24-pay-was-20mn/articleshow/110376802.cms,"BENGALURU: Former Wipro CEO Thierry Delaporte earned a staggering $20 million in the 2023-24 financial year, making him the highest-paid CEO in the Indian IT industry . Delaporte's compensation doubled compared to the previous year, primarily due to a cash compensation of $4.3 million resulting from the accelerated vesting of 989,130 unvested stock options . As of April 6, Srini Pallia has taken over as Wipro's new CEO, succeeding Delaporte.According to the US SEC filing, Delaporte's $20 million compensation package included $3.9 million paid as salary and allowance, $4.3 million as long-term incentives, $5 million as variable pay and commission and $6.8 million as other benefits.In contrast, TCS CEO K Krithivasan received a relatively modest compensation of Rs 25.3 crore in the same financial year, positioning him as one of the lowest-paid CEOs among his counterparts in the Indian IT sector. Rajesh Gopinathan, Krithivasan's predecessor, earned Rs 29.2 crore as total remuneration for the 2022-23 financial year. Meanwhile, Infosys CEO Salil Parekh and Wipro's new CEO Srini Pallia received Rs 56 crore and Rs 50 crore, respectively.Wipro chairman Rishad Premji saw a 19% drop in his compensation to $769,456 in the 2023-24 financial year. Premji is entitled to a commission of 0.35% on the company's incremental consolidated net profits compared to the previous fiscal year. However, due to negative incremental net profits in the 2024 fiscal year, no commission was payable to him.Former Wipro CFO Jatin Dalal, saw a significant drop in earnings to $243,796 in the 2023-24 financial year compared to slightly over $1 million in the previous year.

Currently, it has 40 subsidiaries, two joint ventures and two associate companies.Tata Consumer's international operations are mainly a result of its historical acquisitions like Good Earth herbal tea and Eight O'Clock coffee brands in the US.It is transferring the manufacturing and distribution of instant tea powder business in the US under Tata Tea Extractions and the Eight O'Clock coffee investments, also in the US, under Consolidated Coffee to Tata Consumer Products US Holdings (TCP-US). Once transfers are completed, Tata Tea Extractions and Consolidated Coffee will cease to exist. It is further consolidating the branded business in the US by merging five entities into TCP-US. On completion of the restructuring, the US business will be held by Tata Consumer Products UK Group - a 100% arm of the Indian parent. The restructuring is expected to be completed by Dec 31, Tata Consumer said in its FY24 report.The move is expected to reduce the number of legal entities, simplify operational layers and create a unified holding structure for the US branded business and improve market focus, the foods & beverages company, helmed by Sunil D'Souza said.Further, Tata Consumer is merging three subsidiaries in India - Tata Consumer Soulfull (acquired in 2021), Tata SmartFoodz (also purchased in 2021) and NourishCo Beverages (bought out Pepsico's 50% stake in the company) - with itself.

The coffee plantations business, however, has been separated from Tata Coffee and housed under TCPL Beverages & Foods.Chairman N Chandrasekaran, in his address to shareholders in the FY24 report, said that the acquisition of Capital Foods and Organic India has the potential to substantially expand the company's total addressable market into adjacent high-growth categories.","Tata Consumer's international operations are mainly a result of its historical acquisitions like Good Earth herbal tea and Eight O'Clock coffee brands in the US.

RBI dividend can help boost India's credit rating,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rbi-dividend-can-help-boost-indias-credit-rating/articleshow/110375554.cms,"How does a regulatory and financial authority like RBI declare dividends?

Are profits a goal for RBI?

How did it make a record profit?

Why is this dividend good news ?

Why are bonds rallying?

While RBI can create money, the dividend that it has paid to the government are out of actual earnings. A large part of this earning is higher interest income on foreign securities and profits from selling foreign exchange . The record surplus could help India improve its credit rating ...RBI acts as both a regulator and a monetary authority. It manages money supply and oversees foreign exchange markets. RBI accumulates foreign currency reserves to stabilise the rupee against speculative inflows. During challenging periods like the global financial crisis or the pandemic, central banks expanded their balance sheets through quantitative easing, which involves pumping money by purchasing bonds from banks. As a result, RBI profits from interest on domestic and foreign bonds as well as market operations. In its forex operations, RBI sells dollars it purchased when there is a surge in inflows during times of scarcity. As these sales are at prevailing market prices, it makes a tidy profit.No. Surpluses are a byproduct of RBI working towards its objectives of financial and market stability. It is said that RBI generates more profits during difficult times because it is during crisis that central bank's intervention in forex and money market spikes. Profit cannot be an objective for the central bank in its market operations as RBI is the biggest insider in the market.Since the annual report is not published, we can only conjecture on the reasons. One could be the sharp rise in interest rates in the US where RBI parks a major chunk of its $644 billion forex reserves (Rs 54 lakh crore). Second, RBI has been buying and selling a lot more dollars this year compared to last year as FIIs have been selling equities. The third element of the earnings are RBI's money market operations. Given that RBI has kept liquidity in a deficit mode to combat inflation, it has had many opportunities to lend to banks.The Rs 2.1 lakh crore that govt will receive is a windfall - nearly double what was budgeted from all financial institutions put together. According to S&P, the additional amount is around 0.35% of GDP. Everything else remaining unchanged, it would reduce the fiscal deficit by that extent. S&P has said that if govt uses the money to reduce its deficit (reducing borrowing), that would increase chances of a ratings upgrade. A rating upgrade would improve India's standing for global investors - a positive sign for markets as capital would flow in. If govt chooses to use the windfall to either stimulate the economy or provide relief to the poor, it would again be a positive as it would increase consumption.Record revenues through dividend and GST have led markets to believe that there will be a sharp drop in govt borrowing. When govt borrows less, there is more money left for corporate borrowers and interest rates dip. When interest rates dip, existing bonds that offer higher rates get sold at a premium.","RBI can create money, the dividend that it has paid to the government are out of actual earnings.

Former Lava MD sends imposter for medical bail check-up

Lava International claims Hari Om Rai resigned from the company board. Rai, former MD of Lava mobile phones, was sent to judicial custody after allegedly arranging a fake medical report at AIIMS. Delhi high court refused to extend his medical bail, leading to a fresh FIR against an imposter and others.

NEW DELHI: Country’s sole surviving homegrown mobile phone brand Lava has recast its board after its co-founder Hari Om Rai resigned, months after his arrest by ED on money laundering charges, and is looking to tap private equity player to raise around Rs 600 crore for launching new smartphones .Former BSNL chairman Anupam Srivastava and former LG of Andaman & Nicobar Islands Lt Gen Ajay Kumar Singh (Retd) have been inducted as independent directors.Company officials said that Rai’s arrest “will not have a bearing” on the fund-raise plans. “We have been given to understand by the legal teams that it is a private matter of the promoter,” one of the officials said.Lava, which saw a business turmoil following the arrest of Rai, is betting on new smartphones after witnessing healthy adoption of its 5G devices, where sales grew 250% last year to 1.5 million units. “While feature phones have been the mainstay for us in terms of volumes, we have seen encouraging adoption of our smartphones and thus want to expand in this segment,” Sunil Raina, who has been inducted on the board as executive director, told TOI.Raina said that Lava — a beneficiary of govt’s production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme for smartphones — has a capacity to produce 42 million units, which it can now use to expand business.But fund-raise will be critical for the company (which had revenues of around Rs 2,800 crore last year) as it will have to battle it out with the Chinese brands such as Vivo, Oppo, Xiaomi, and RealMe.Lava has also inducted long-time production hand, Sanjeev Agarwal, on the board, and hopes that a revamped leadership will help investors look at the brand favourably.","Lava, the country's sole surviving mobile phone brand, has recast its board by inducting former BSNL chairman Anupam Srivastava and former Lt.

According to Biswas, he left the next day in a car saying he was going for a medical check-up but did not return.

In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Ramaswamy said he seeks to “engage in a dialogue with board or management about numerous operational and strategic opportunities to maximize shareholder value, including a shift in the company’s strategy.”The stock surged 20% to $3.01, the biggest gain since February 2024.Ramaswamy founded pharmaceutical company Roivant Sciences Ltd in 2014 and co-founded Strive Asset Management in 2022. He stepped away from the asset management firm last year to focus on his presidential run and has said he isn’t returning. Ramaswamy’s position in BuzzFeed marks his latest move since ending his political campaign, and his interest in BuzzFeed raises questions about the direction of the company. “Stay tuned,” Ramaswamy said through a spokesperson when asked for comment about his investment.“BuzzFeed is purposely structured to protect its editorial integrity,” a spokesperson for the company said in a statement. “We are always open to hearing ideas from our shareholders.”Strive Asset Management is an anti-activism fund, which has pushed companies to stay out of “woke” politics and has pressured about a dozen companies to end compensation incentives for environmental and social goals. The purchase makes Ramaswamy the fourth largest shareholder in BuzzFeed, trailing Comcast Corp, NEA Management Co and Hearst Communications Inc.BuzzFeed, known for its online quizzes, lists of “bests” and articles on pop culture, has struggled in recent years due to cutbacks in internet advertising. The company went public in 2021 in a volatile debut and the shares have fallen about 92% since then. Last year, the company eliminated its news division amid broader layoffs and in quarterly results released last week BuzzFeed said it expects revenue to decline 21% to 30% in the current quarter. That’s after an 18% decline in sales in the first three months.To address its capital needs, the company said in a separate securities filing last week that it “may explore options to restructure its outstanding debt, and is working with advisers to optimize its condensed consolidated balance sheet.” Last week, BuzzFeed announced changes that would tie compensation of Chief Executive Officer Jonah Peretti and other executives to the company’s stock performance.Earlier this year BuzzFeed said it would sell media company Complex for $108.6 million and reduce its remaining workforce by 16%.","Vivek Ramaswamy reported a 7.7% stake in BuzzFeed, worth about $6.81 million. The company's stock surged 20% to $3.01, the biggest gain since February 2024.

Stock market alert: JP Morgan predicts major decline for S&P 500,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/stock-market-alert-jp-morgan-predicts-major-decline-for-sp-500/articleshow/110369276.cms,"NEW DELHI: JP Morgan has issued a stark warning about the US stock market , predicting a significant drop in the S&P 500 by the end of the year. The bank's chief market strategist , Marko Kolanovic, projects the index to fall to 4,200, marking the lowest year-end target among major Wall Street banks. This forecast implies a more than 21% decline from current levels.""With very high equity valuations, we do not see equities as attractive investments at the moment, and we don't see a reason to change our stance,"" Kolanovic wrote in an analyst note this week. This pessimistic outlook is one of the most severe on Wall Street, a Fox News report said.Despite recent record highs, including the Dow Jones Industrial Average surpassing 40,000 for the first time and the S&P 500 reaching over 5,300, Kolanovic suggests these gains are unlikely to last. He cites several factors contributing to the bearish forecast, including sustained high interest rates, signs of persistent inflation, evidence of financial strain among lower-income consumers, and increasing geopolitical uncertainties.Kolanovic also pointed out that the recent boost from artificial intelligence developments is unlikely to counterbalance these traditional market challenges. ""We don't think that narrow themes like AI chips can compensate for all of those traditional market challenges that historically worked against the cycle,"" he said.This gloomy forecast follows a volatile year for the stock market. All three major indexes experienced significant declines in mid-2023 due to fears that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates higher than expected and maintain them at peak levels for an extended period. However, the indexes have since recovered those losses and more, with the S&P 500 up more than 29% since its low at the end of October.Year-to-date, the S&P 500 has risen about 11.5%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has climbed 5.5%, and the Nasdaq Composite has increased about 12%. Despite these gains, the warning from JPMorgan suggests that investors should brace for potential turbulence ahead.","JP Morgan has issued a stark warning about the US stock market predicting a significant drop in the S&P 500 by the end of the year.
