No OTP for online transactions? Telecommunications companies have cautioned that a new directive from the industry regulator, set to take effect on November 1, could lead to significant disruptions in the delivery of transactional and service messages. The mandate aims to ensure the traceability of messages sent by principal entities (PEs) such as banks, ecommerce companies, and financial institutions.According to officials, the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), which includes members such as Reliance Jio Bharti Airtel , and Vodafone Idea , has approached Trai seeking relaxations in implementing the traceability mandate.As per the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) mandate, telecom operators must ensure that messages from PEs to recipients are traceable starting from November. Messages with undefined or mismatched telemarketer chains should be rejected, meaning that messages with entirely undefined chains must be blocked or not delivered to the customer.Telecom operators are warning that messages containing OTPs and other critical information may not reach recipients, as telemarketers and PEs have yet to implement the necessary technical solutions, according to an ET report.Industry data reveals that 1.5-1.7 billion commercial messages are sent daily in India, highlighting the potential scale of disruption if messages are blocked or undelivered.While telecom operators have informed the regulator that their systems are prepared to implement the mandate from November 1, they have also noted that telemarketers and PEs require more time to complete the necessary activities on their end. PEs, in turn, are requesting a two-month extension to the deadline to finalize their implementation.Also Read | Don’t fall prey to these scams! 10 common ways in which scamsters can fraud you The telecom companies have requested TRAI to grant them additional time to fully implement the mandate related to commercial messages. According to the telcos, the principal entities (PE) and telemarketers need more time to complete their activities and ensure proper scrubbing of the messaging traffic to minimize any disruption. The industry has proposed to Trai to allow them to implement the mandate in ""logger mode"" starting from November 1, during which telcos will not block the traffic in case of any discrepancies or non-compliance.To minimize inconvenience to consumers and ensure a smooth transition, the telcos have informed the regulator that they will provide daily reports to telemarketers and PEs, enabling them to take necessary corrective measures. The telecom companies plan to fully implement the blocking mode by December 1.This marks the second instance where the telecom industry has requested a one-month extension to comply with Trai's mandate regarding commercial messages. Previously, the regulator had extended the deadline for whitelisting messages containing URLs, OTT links, and other related information by a month until October 1, following a request from the telcos for more time to set up the required systems. After the extension, the systems are reported to be functioning well, with most PEs and telemarketers having come on board.Also Read | Who Will Be World’s First Top 10 Trillionaires? Two Indians, Gautam Adani & Mukesh Ambani, Make It To The List! Elon Musk Leads - Check Full List The whitelisting process requires entities sending commercial messages to provide all relevant information, such as URLs, call-back numbers, and more, to the telecom companies. The telcos then feed this information into their blockchain-based distributed ledger technology (DLT) platform. If the provided information matches the platform's records, the message is allowed to pass through; otherwise, it is blocked.Trai has been actively working on various initiatives to curb the misuse of headers and content templates, aiming to create a more secure and efficient telecom ecosystem. The regulator had been encouraging telcos to implement the whitelisting mechanism since May 2023, but the industry was not fully prepared with the necessary infrastructure.At that time, Trai had instructed the telcos to ensure that only whitelisted URLs, APKs, OTT links, and call-back numbers were included in the content template and to submit a compliance report on the issue within 45 days.","Telecom companies have cautioned that a new directive from the industry regulator could lead to significant disruptions in the delivery of transactional and service messages.

Forget gold buying this festive season?

Top Performing Silver ETFs

Gold vs Silver buying: Silver presents an attractive option for aggressive investors seeking portfolio diversification and alpha generation beyond traditional equities, believe analysts. Despite the recent surge in domestic prices, which saw silver reach the Rs 1 lakh per kg mark, analysts suggest that investors consider allocating 3-5% of their portfolio to the white metal by buying on dips over the next 1-3 months.Since the beginning of the calendar year 2024, silver has experienced impressive gains, rising by 33.65% to touch the Rs 1 lakh per kg mark. In the past month alone, it has gained 12.5%, outperforming the Nifty 50 index, which returned 12.5% during the calendar year but lost 5.6% over the past month.In dollar terms, silver's performance has been even more remarkable, with gains of 47.25% and 13.56%, respectively, over the same periods.Vishnu Kant Upadhyay, AVP-Research and Advisory at Master Capital Services, attributes the increasing market value of silver to its extensive use in various industries.""Silver is extensively utilised in electronics, solar panels, batteries, and increasingly in semiconductors, making it a critical component in modern technology. The growing industrial demand for silver along with the anticipation of another rate cut by the Federal Reserve is causing an increase in the metal's market value,” he told ET.Also Read | Silver better than gold for investment? Silver prices cross Rs 1 lakh mark! Manav Modi, a bullion analyst at Motilal Oswal Financial Services, highlights the factors supportingsilver prices , including ""Rising industrial demand, high domestic imports, ETF buying by investors and Fed rate cuts have been supportive for silver.""While acknowledging the possibility of profit-booking following the sharp rally, Modi advises investors to view major dips as buying opportunities. He projects that silver could reach Rs 1.25 lakh per kg over the next 12 months.As advancements in technology continue and the need for electronic devices and semiconductors grows, the demand for silver is expected to remain strong, leading to a sustained upward trend in prices.Bhavesh Jain, co-head of Hybrid and Solutions Funds at Edelweiss Asset Management, stated, ""Silver has seen a strong long-term bullish break; the trend could likely continue supported by lower rates for longer and the revival in Chinese industrial activity."" Jain suggests that investing in silver ETFs is a more convenient option for investors compared to purchasing physical silver.Also Read | Looking to beat fixed deposit returns? Here’s what investors can consider instead of FD However, some fund managers believe that the long-term prospects of silver will be influenced by the adoption and adherence to climate change and green technology initiatives by major global economies.Vikram Dhawan, head of commodities and fund manager at Nippon India Mutual Fund, explained, ""If investors believe in Earth's rising temperature problem and its consequences, silver can serve as a proxy hedge.""Nirav Karkera, head of research at Fisdom, advises, ""Aggressive investors could buy on every fall and allocate 5-15% of their portfolio to the white metal.""Dhawan pointed out that in the short term, silver prices may be affected by a Republican victory in the US, as Donald Trump is not known for his environmentalist stance and instead favors fossil fuels.Considering the anticipated volatility, the upcoming US elections, and uncertainty regarding further rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, wealth managers recommend that investors consider staggering their silver purchases.","Since the beginning of calendar year 2024, silver has experienced impressive gains, rising by 33.65%.

Lulu Retail Holdings IPO : Running one of the Middle East's biggest hypermarket chains, Lulu Retail Holdings, has started the process for its initial public offering (IPO). According to bankers, this IPO has the potential to be the largest in the UAE this year.Lulu, founded in 1974 by Indian businessman Yusuff Ali , follows other grocery firms that have recently listed, such as UAE-based Spinneys this year and Saudi grocery retailer BinDawood Holding in 2020.The IPO, scheduled from October 28 to November 5, will offer more than 2.582 billion shares, with trading expected to commence on the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange on November 14, as per Lulu's IPO document.The conglomerate, which operates over 240 stores across the six Gulf Co-operation Council countries, is launching its IPO amidst a thriving retail spending environment in the region, which is encouraging domestic listings by companies in the sector.Two sources involved in the transaction told Reuters that the offering could raise between $1.7 billion and $1.8 billion for the 25% stake.Chief Executive Saifee Rupawala expressed confidence in Lulu's continued success, saying in the IPO document, ""We are confident that Lulu will continue to be where the world comes to shop.""He highlighted the $100-billion market opportunity presented by GCC retail over the next five years and emphasized the firm's potential for further growth in Saudi Arabia.Consumers in the Middle East are increasingly opting for local and regional brands over international ones. Companies like Alokozay have emerged as competitors to Coca Cola and Pepsi, while some Western brands, including Starbucks, have faced boycotts due to Israel's offensive in the Gaza Strip, the Reuters report said.In Saudi Arabia, Savola Group announced plans in February to list its grocery subsidiary, Panda Retail.

"Stock market crash today: BSE Sensex ends 663 points down; Nifty50 below 24,200",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/stock-market-today-bse-sensex-nifty50-october-25-2024-dalal-street-indian-equities-global-markets/articleshow/114569351.cms,"The index has been consolidating due to persistent foreign outflows and lackluster earnings reports. (AI image)

Why BSE Sensex and Nifty50 have crashed today

Several key factors were responsible for the market selloff:

1) Weak Q2 Earnings

2) FII Selling

3) High Bond Yields and Strong Dollar

4) US Election

Stock market today : Indian stock market experienced a significant downturn on Friday, with the BSE Sensex plummeting over 800 points and the Nifty50 falling below the 24,150 level. BSE Sensex ended the day at 79,402.29, down 663 points or 0.83%. Nifty50 closed the day at 24,180.80, down 219 points or 0.90%.This decline was primarily attributed to disappointing second-quarter earnings reports from major companies such as IndusInd Bank and NTPC, as well as the ongoing exodus of foreign investors from the Indian market.Several heavyweight stocks, including IndusInd Bank, M&M, L&T, ICICI Bank, Reliance Industries, HDFC Bank, SBI, and NTPC, were the main contributors to the Sensex's decline. Across sectors, Nifty Auto, Bank, Metal, PSU Bank, Realty, and Consumer Durables experienced losses.The disappointing second-quarter results from various blue-chip and other companies left investors dissatisfied, putting pressure on the benchmark indices. ""The consensus downward revision in FY25 earnings estimates and the weak Q2 numbers have soured sentiment, shifting it to a slightly bearish mode,"" said Dr. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services.Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have been consistently selling Indian shares for the past 19 sessions, redirecting their funds to China due to Beijing's stimulus measures and relatively cheaper valuations. As of October 24, FIIs had offloaded Rs 98,085 crore from the Indian market.The elevated 10-year Treasury yield, which remains above 4%, and the strengthening dollar index have negatively impacted the Indian equity market. These factors can trigger foreign fund outflows and increase import costs, ultimately affecting corporate earnings.The uncertainty surrounding the upcoming US election has added to the market's concerns. The tight race between former Republican President Donald Trump and Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris for key competitive states has contributed to the market's volatility.Rising speculation of a Trump win in certain betting markets has supported US yields and the dollar, driven by the Republican candidate's inflationary tax and tariff policies.","BSE Sensex ended the day at 79,402.29, down 663 points or 0.83%.

(AI image)

DA Hike Calculator: How much will the take home salary increase?

To understand the impact of this 3% DA hike, let's consider an example:

Assuming a central government employee has a basic pay of Rs 46,200, their previous dearness allowance at 50% was Rs 23,100. With the DA now at 53%, their dearness allowance will increase to Rs 24,486.

This means they will receive an additional Rs 1,386 (Rs 24,486 - Rs 23,100) in DA from October. As the DA hike is effective from July 1, 2024, they will also receive arrears for the last three months.

DR Hike Calculator: How much will the pension increase?

If a central government pensioner receives a basic pension of Rs 50,400 per month, at the previous 50% DR, they were getting Rs 25,200.

With the DR now at 53%, they will receive Rs 26,712 monthly as dearness relief. This means their pension will increase by Rs 1,512 per month.

DA hike calculator : PM Narendra Modi-led Union Cabinet has approved a 3% increase in the dearness allowance (DA) for central government employees on October 16, 2024. Additionally, the dearness relief (DR) for central government pensioners has also been raised by 3%. As a result of this latest hike, the DA and DR now stand at 53% for both central government employees and pensioners respectively. This decision is set to benefit over 1 crore individuals.The dearness allowance, a component of the salary for government employees and pensioners, has been increased to 53%. This rise in DA will lead to an increase in the take-home salary of central government employees starting from October 2024.The effective date for the increased DA and DR is July 1, 2024. The central government typically revises these allowances twice a year, in January and July, with official announcements being made at a later date. Consequently, the DA/DR hike is implemented retrospectively from the cut-off date of July 1, 2024.Also Read | Dearness allowance hiked!

BSNL gains subscribers as private telcos lose users,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/bsnl-gains-subscribers-as-private-telcos-lose-users/articleshow/114601750.cms,"NEW DELHI: Generally perceived a laggard, BSNL is on a roll over the past few months as many consumers shifted to the state-owned telco after recent tariff hikes by private telecom companies .Numbers released by regulator Trai show that BSNL's subscriber base has been inching up for the past two months, aided by lower tariffs and possibly 'soft launch' of its 4G services.In July, BSNL gained nearly 3 million new subscribers even as all others, including biggies Reliance Jio Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea , lost users. Airtel lost 1.7 million users, Voda Idea was down by 1.4 million and Jio was lower by nearly 0.8 million.In August also BSNL was the only player that gained subscribers as all others declined. BSNL gained 2.5 million new subscribers in the month, while Jio lost 4 million users, Airtel (2.4 million) and Voda Idea (1.9 million).Overall though, BSNL's market share still remains much lower to that of its bigger private rivals. While Jio leads the market with a share of 40.5% at August-end this year, Airtel's market share stands at 33% and Voda Idea at 18%. BSNL's has a share of 7.8% and it becomes 8% if you add 0.2% share of MTNL, Trai said.BSNL seems to be gaining now as its tariffs are the lowest in industry, reflected in its Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) score, which is a key metric to measure per consumer contribution. BSNL's ARPU is understood to be under Rs 100 (estimated at around Rs 90) compared to Airtel's Rs 211, Jio's Rs 195 and Voda Idea (Rs 146). This effectively means that PSU telco is charging the least from its consumers.One of the reasons for the lower tariffs is pretty logical - the company is yet to officially launch high-speed 4G when private operators such as Jio and Airtel have migrated a large part of their users to 5G. Voda Idea is the only private company to be still on 4G, even though it's now moving swiftly to migrate to 5G after recent fund-raise.BSNL's 4G hinges on the success of the govt's efforts to develop an 'India stack' where the network upgradation work has been entrusted to a local consortium that includes TCS and Tejas Networks of Tata group, and govt-owned C-DoT. Govt has refused to give the orders to global giants, such as Nokia, Ericsson and Samsung.","BSNL gained nearly 3 million new subscribers in July as all others, including biggies Reliance Jio Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea, lost users.

Railway Budget 2024 : The government has wavered little in its efforts to spur a modernisation of railways in the country, pivoting on technology, to support the country’s economic ambitions. In line with expectations, Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore, marking yet another year of successive increase in outlay.That takes forward the past policies and the government’s vision, which have paved the way for modernisation of the transport behemoth.In earlier decades, the government had focused on laying tracks on new routes, electrification and incremental rolling stock capacity addition. That was the need of the hour back then and has helped set up the base for a larger transformation.For instance, the massive Dedicated Freight Corridor ( DFC ) as well as locomotive factories at Marhaura and Madhepura in Bihar were conceptualised over a decade ago and we are seeing their completion now.More recently, the focus has shifted to modernisation—of rolling stock and safety systems, among other aspects.This year, emphasis has also been laid on the railways’ crucial role in industrial development. Commodity-specific corridors have been planned in eastern India and impetus given to port connectivity. Vande Bharat and technology-led upgrades in rolling stock remain in focus. Safety has been prioritised through budgetary allocations for the anti-collision systemKavach . That said, there are other cogs in the wheel that demand attention from a long-term perspective.First, the target for the Operating Ratio, the crucial efficiency gauge, has been set at 98.22% for 2024-25, compared with 98.65% in 2023-24. This reflects an imminent need for operational transformation. An effective overhaul of the world’s fourth-largest rail network will take many years and thus we need to start focusing on improving efficiency and reducing costs now.DFC is almost entirely operational and will be complete over the next few months. To ensure the project achieves its twin goals of reducing logistics costs and enhancing freight efficiency, railways need to attract more cargo on the corridor. This will help increase the rail coefficient and make the railways’ approach more market-oriented, which will in turn aid future corridors.A revamp of railway stations is on track, with sufficient funds dedicated to this end. But even though new coaches and wagons are increasingly being added to meet footfalls, the stations and passenger trains themselves remain synonymous with chaos.Just as safety, comfort and convenience have been prioritised, there is a need for solutions to address the capacity and demand challenges. As a first step, the government could target development of new stations and setting up of new coach production units.As a leading freight mover, Indian Railways carried a record 1,588 MT cargo in fiscal 2024, up from 1,095 MT in fiscal 2015. It accounts for 26% of the cargo moved in the country—by no means an easy feat. The railways aims to take this volume to 3,000 MT by 2030, which would require a 11% CAGR against the around 4.2% witnessed over the last 10 years. As per a report by TERI and Shakti Foundation, from carrying about 62% of freight traffic in 1990-91, Indian Railways’ share has declined to ~27% in 2014-15. This has been due to the expanding road network, cost competitiveness over railways, and door-to-door service. Thus, commencing the cycle of increasing the rail share again is commendable.DFCs, a high-capacity track network, high-power locomotives and improvement in wagon designs have set the ball rolling for larger capacity, faster freight trains that deliver better efficiency.Yet, achieving exponential growth is a tall ask given the current dynamics. Possibly, similar challenges might apply to other goals the railways might have for 2047.To be fair, despite its scale and complexity, Indian Railways has been able to achieve diverse developments at commendable speed.But the track ahead is long and it is time to start discussing the reinvention of the institutional set-up.Indian Railways sees substantial private sector involvement in the form of vendors and contractors. Policymakers could start mulling extreme options such as parallel privately-owned and operated railway infrastructure, coupled with centralised planning and an evolved role for the railways. This will need a robust policy framework from the Government of India.The time is perhaps also ripe to bring user charge and asset monetisation-driven segments for passengers as well as cargo to the discussion table. Globally, the separation of infrastructure and operations in railways has delivered mixed results, for example in the United Kingdom. The model should be analysed and revisited to understand its potential relevance in the Indian context.The key would be to retrace our steps and align our long-term goals to identify not just incremental changes but also ways to explore bold and path-breaking alternatives that put Indian Railways on a smooth track and bring it up to speed.","Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore.

Budget 2024 capital gains tax changes: The Narendra Modi government is considering suggestions for tweaks in the new long term capital gains tax regime that was announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman in Union Budget 2024.The July 23 budget reduced the LTCG tax on property from 20% to 12.5%. The indexation benefit, which allowed taxpayers to adjust the acquisition cost for inflation before calculating capital gains and thus reduce their tax liability, is proposed to be eliminated for properties purchased on or after April 1, 2001.The government publishes the Cost Inflation Index (CII) annually for this calculation.India Inc is appealing to the government for a gradual shift to the long-term capital gains tax regime proposed in the FY25 budget, which aims to eliminate indexation benefits for property, gold, and other unlisted assets.According to an ET report by Deepshikha Sikarwar, the industry is suggesting alternatives such as a higher tax rate with indexation or a lower rate of 12.5% without indexation, as well as some form of grandfathering for ancestral properties.The finance ministry is currently reviewing these proposals and will discuss them with the Prime Minister's Office. The final decision will be made closer to the date when the Finance Bill reply is to be presented in Parliament, the reports said.Industry groups are expected to submit formal proposals to the finance ministry in the near future.

Budget 2024 for manufacturing sector : The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth. While the middle class has been offered tax relief, the government's primary focus remains on judicious spending to maximize economic impact. The budget's core themes are employment, skilling, MSME development, and support for the middle class.Largely focus has remained intact on spending money judiciously to ensure that each penny spent creates a ripple effect in the entire economic landscape.Although at first glance, manufacturing might appear to have taken a backseat, a deeper analysis reveals a multifaceted approach to bolstering the sector. Initiatives like employment-linked benefits and internship programs, while primarily aimed at job creation and skill development, indirectly benefit manufacturing companies by expanding the talent pool.Extensive focus on the MSME manufacturing units by way of extending term loan facility for purchase of machinery and equipment without collateral or third-party guarantee, would help companies in augmenting their capital base/ capacity and strengthen the very foundation of the manufacturing ecosystem in the country. Development of a new credit-assessment model by Public Sector Banks to assess MSME credit shall provide much needed regulatory relief to the units.With respect to the large manufacturing entities, while there is no direct fiscal/ tax incentive introduced in this budget, some support has been provided with an extensive focus on development of ‘industrial parks’ in nearly 100 cities under the ‘plug and play’ model. Reforms proposed with respect to land administration, planning and management, shall also ease out acquisition related difficulties often faced by entrepreneurs/ business houses in acquiring lands for manufacturing set-ups.Targeted Customs duty interventions like, rationalization of Customs duty provisions in Mobile phone manufacturing setups, extension of Customs duty exemption on import of capital goods for manufacturing of solar cells and panels, full Customs duty exemption on import of 25 critical minerals,, shall provide the required impetus for enhancing domestic manufacturing environment.Governments’ focus on formulating an Economic Policy Framework to set the scope for next-gen reforms in the country, has a target to improve the productivity of factors of production, namely, land, labour, capital, entrepreneurship and technology. This shall pave the way for enabling achievement of a target of 25% manufacturing sector contribution to the nation’s GDP over the course of next 7-10 years.While the overall outlook is positive, the extension of tax benefits under Section 115BAB for manufacturing entities and the absence of new PLI schemes are notable omissions.The country’s manufacturing base is expanding as is reflective from the continuously increasing tax collections and expanding Purchasing Manager’s Index. It would be pertinent to see how the ground realities evolve vis-à-vis the vision envisaged, in the upcoming Financial Year.","While the overall outlook is positive, the extension of tax benefits under Section 115BAB for manufacturing entities and the absence of new PLI schemes are notable omissions.

Budget 2024: Armed with the vision to propel India to become a developed country by 2047, the Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business thereby providing the required stimulus to the manufacturing sector and enabling large scale job creation.On the Indirect tax front, the industry welcomes the much-needed announcement for a comprehensive review of the rate structure under Customs enabling ease in product classification and dispute reduction.The proposal of lowering of Customs duty on a plethora of raw materials and products including solar cells, critical minerals and bullion are encouraging measures. The rationale behind such reduction clearly indicates support towards domestic manufacturing, deepening value addition and supporting targets in reducing carbon footprint.Relevant amendments under the Customs law have been made to provide increased time limits for re-imports and re-exports to enhance competitiveness of the fledgling MRO sector. The government has extended significant duty reduction and exemption benefits to the healthcare and electronics sectors, continuing the impetus of incentives provided under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme.Since their introduction in March 2020, the PLI schemes have indeed supported in revitalizing the manufacturing sector and strengthening the necessary supply chains. The success achieved in the mobile manufacturing sector has now enabled the Government to reduce customs duties on mobile phones and components, signalling a mature environment. The Budget proposals aim at reproducing similar outcomes for semiconductor and pharmaceutical industry by increasing the budgetary allocation.Buoyed by the increasing revenue collection under GST signalling a shift towards a mature tax regime, this Budget has harmonized the timeframes for the issuance of demand notices and adjudication orders for cases involving fraud, suppression or otherwise. Significant amendments to the GST legislations have been introduced reflecting the recommendations proposed by the GST Council such as regularizing non-levy of GST due to general practice which may turn out to be a breather for certain impacted industries reeling under huge tax demands.The Insurance sector has been provided much relief through the GST council recommendations which have been cemented in the present budget thereby ending long standing disputes on their business practices.The Government's efforts to push forward with its reform agenda are evident as plans to incentivize states for their business reform actions plans and digitalization through the Jan Vishwas Bill 2.0 is proposed. Further, setting up of e-commerce export hubs is envisaged to facilitate easier access to international markets for domestic players.The recent implementation of Budget proposals allows the government to maintain momentum in its reform agenda. These policy measures implicitly reaffirm the significance of India Inc as a crucial element in the development of infrastructure. However, there are still some expectations required to be met to march towards a Viksit Bharat 2047.",Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business.

Budget 2024 : Real estate, a significant contributor to employment generation, has received a fair bit of attention in Budget 2024-25. Recent years have seen the sector transform rapidly, driven by factors such as favourable government policies, Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, strong economic growth and changing consumer preferences.Added to that, the budgetary focus on job creation, skilling and employment-linked incentives, infrastructure, urban development, rural connectivity, digitalisation and land-related norms, all dovetail to promote growth of the sector.Launched in June 2015, the PMAY aims to provide affordable housing to all eligible beneficiaries. The budget unveiled PMAY Urban 2.0, under which the housing needs of 1 crore urban poor and middle class will be addressed with an investment of Rs 10 lakh crore.The central government’s additional Rs 2.2 lakh crore injection in the next 5 years to make housing more affordable has the potential to revitalise the affordable housing market.Such an approach can play an important role in realising the government's vision of Housing for All and push growth and development. Hence, the significant investment under PMAY Urban 2.0 is expected to alleviate urban housing deficits, spurring construction and economic growth.Steps to introduce technological reforms within the regulatory framework for land, such as digitalisation or GIS mapping of land records, will improve transparency.Rationalisation of stamp duty across states will also be critical to bring in uniformity and initiate land-related reforms such as urban planning, usage and building bylaws.These are steps in the right direction and will boost growth. Moreover, they will improve the ease of property transactions and strengthen municipal finances through increased property taxes. Rationalization of stamp duty with an emphasis on women homebuyers may boost home-buyer sentiment in major cities, too.The budget has also given ample attention to urban and rural development, with rental housing for industrial workers through the public private partnership model, interest subsidies for rental housing, and transit-oriented developments.The proposal to develop investment-ready plug-and-play industrial parks in 100 cities may attract industrial investment, leading to increased demand for industrial real estate and support the growth of ancillary services and residential developments in these regions.Initiatives for industrial parks and rental housing for industrial workers align with the country’s manufacturing goals and addresses worker accommodation needs.These steps are expected to promote industrial growth and stability in labour-intensive sectors, while also creating new opportunities for real estate developers specialising in rental and affordable housing.The changes in long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax, however, have evoked a mixed reaction. The government lowered the long-term capital gains tax from 20% to 12.5%, which is a welcome step. However, this came with the removal of the indexation benefit.The changes could encourage more liquidity in property transactions and potentially increase the effective tax burden depending on the property’s acquisition date.The launch of Phase IV of the PM Gram Sadak Yojana in 25,000 rural habitations will improve connectivity in rural areas, promoting rural development and making these regions more accessible for investment. The primary objective of PMGSY is to build robust, all-weather roads in rural habitations. This initiative focuses on enhancing connectivity and supporting economic development in rural areas.In essence, the budget is geared towards stimulating growth and investment in the real estate sector , fostering a more transparent and investor-friendly environment, and contributing to overall development. It aims to create a balanced and inclusive growth environment by addressing the needs of various segments, including affordable housing, industrial workers and urban infrastructure.The effectiveness of the initiatives, however, hinges on their implementation and continued support of complementary reforms.","The budget unveiled PMAY Urban 2.0, under which the housing needs of 1 crore urban poor and middle class will be addressed with an investment of Rs 10 lakh crore.

New Budget 2024 rule: Why Income Tax Department is likely to issue a huge number of tax notices this month,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-budget-2024-rule-why-income-tax-department-is-likely-to-issue-a-huge-number-of-tax-notices-this-month/articleshow/112186079.cms,"Taxing Times

Income Tax Notice on the way? The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month, as there are concerns that many taxpayers might escape the tax net due to the impending implementation of the new reassessment law on September 1, 2024.According to the amended regulation announced in Budget 2024 , the tax authorities can only go back a maximum of five years to reassess a taxpayer's records if the escaped income is at least Rs 50 lakh, and three years for an amount less than Rs 50 lakh.Previously, they could reassess cases up to 10 years old.According to an ET report, tax officials are now faced with the challenge of compiling and corroborating data on tax and income mismatches for the financial years 2013-14 to 2017-18 within the next few weeks, as these years will become time-barred for reassessment from September 1, 2024.The I-T department relies on information from various sources, such as banks, property registrars, and search findings from the investigation wing, to build reassessment cases.A tax officers' body has raised concerns about the feasibility of issuing notices under Section 148 (or 148A) in a large number of cases within a single month, given the overburdened nature of the jurisdictional assessing officers and the time-consuming process of obtaining sanction from the chief commissioner, who is the specified authority for such notices.Moreover, the law provides taxpayers with the right to explain their position before reassessment orders are finalized, a process that most believe cannot be completed by the end of August.Also Read | ITR refund status for FY 2023-24: How to check income tax refund status online - here’s a step-by-step guide for incometax.gov.in & NSDL websites The Central Board of Direct Taxes ( CBDT ) has been urged by its officers to postpone the effective date of the proposed amendment. However, this suggestion is unlikely to be well-received by corporations and high net worth individuals.""Capping the reassessment period at five years was a great decision as it would reduce hassles and litigation. But if the department fears there could be a genuine loss of revenue as it may not be possible to wrap up several matters by August 31, the government can think of strict parameters where time-bound cases can be selectively reopened - based on trails of steps taken in identifying escaped income,"" said Mitil Chokshi, partner at CA firm Chokshi & Chokshi.""Taxpayers may expect a rush of reassessment notices in August 2024. These notices are likely to be for the AYs 2018-19 and prior to that. It is pertinent to note that the Bombay High Court in a recent ruling in a case of Hexaware Technologies has taken a view on a proviso introduced in 2021, which can be interpreted to mean that AY 2017-18 (and prior years) got time barred on March 31, 2024. These reassessment notices (for AYs 2017-18 and prior) are likely to rake up new interpretation issues in the already muddled reassessment provisions,"" said Ashish Mehta, partner at law firm Khaitan & Co.The current situation is similar to the conflict between the Income Tax office and taxpayers in 2021. The reassessment law was amended in April 2021, allowing the tax office to reopen 10-year-old tax returns if the total undisclosed income exceeded Rs 50 lakh and reassess 4-year-old matters if the amount was less than Rs 50 lakh.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? However, this change led to over 10,000 writ petitions being filed by companies, arguing that they were not given sufficient time to explain and that the notices were issued without considering the carve-out that cases which couldn't be reopened earlier couldn't be reassessed under the new law.The Supreme Court invoked its extraordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution on May 4, 2022, to uphold all reassessment notices issued after March 31, 2021. However, the court left room for judicial proceedings based on the merits of each case, and several such matters are currently pending before the court.","The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month.

NPS and EPF: Overlapping services

What is NPS Vatsalaya?

Latest NPS rules, news: In the Union Budget 2024 speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced two new initiatives with regard to National Pension Scheme (NPS) - extension of NPS 14% employer contribution benefits to private setcor and the intended launch of NPS Vatsalya.Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries, bringing it at par with the provisions available for government employees.Sriram Iyer, CEO, HDFC Pension Management told ET that with this move the “ground rules have been harmonised among government and non-government employees, which is a positive step.”Effectively, this means that now, private-sector employees can choose to reduce the taxable portion of employers’ contribution to their NPS corpus, thereby paying less tax and leaving greater funds in their pension deposits.“Employees will benefit from tax savings . More importantly, the 40% increase in contribution will have a significant impact on the terminal value of the retirement corpus,” remarked Iyer. The extended savings will “help in retirement planning, working as an option that is at par with the Provident Fund,” Dinesh Rohira, CEO & Founder, 5nance.com was quoted as saying.Moreover, the endeavour aims to increase NPS penetration by increasing tax incentives for the private sector, providing them a social security-cushion post-retirement.The scheme’s motive to widen the NPS subscriber base may not prove to be flawlessly effective, however. This is explained by Agrees Mrin Agarwal, Founder, Finsafe India: “While it’s good that the limit has been raised, it may not increase adoption as employees need to be educated in a big way. Also, the benefit is only for the salaried opting for the new tax regime,” she says.The mandatory contribution to the EPF, too, threatens to relegate the provisions of NPS under the umbrella of near-superfluity. This sentiment is echoed by Varun Sahay, a software engineer in a Delhi-based IT company: “When 12% of my salary is already deducted for the EPF, why should I put in more in the NPS and cut my take-home pay?”Rohira feels otherwise. “There’s no competition between the NPS and EPF as employees can contribute to both and build a 3-4 times bigger corpus while earning 3-4% higher returns via marketlinked options in the NPS,” he counters.Also Check | New Tax Regime 2023 vs 2024 After Budget: How Much Income Tax Will Salaried Taxpayers Save & How Do New Tax Slabs Compare To Old Regime? Top 10 Points You Must Know To jumpstart retirement savings for children, a new initiative called NPS Vatsalya has been unveiled in the Budget. This scheme allows parents and guardians to contribute to a minor's account, which can be converted into a regular NPS account once the child reaches adulthood.""It provides a very long duration for reaping the compounding benefits and accumulating a huge bounty at a later age. This can be a good way to plan a better future for kids who may not opt for a service segment in the future,"" says Rohira. Sriram Iyer agrees, stating, ""It’s a good move to help the child start his retirement journey. Even if a parent starts when the child is 10 years old, by the time he starts working, it can be a solid foundation for the compounding journey after that.""However, some experts question the utility of a product with such a long lock-in period, especially when parents cannot use the funds for essential goals like their child’s education amidst soaring education costs of 11-12%.""Parents are struggling to save for their own retirement, so it might be a bit of a stretch to expect them to save for their kids’ retirement. The need of the hour is a market-linked product that allows withdrawals only for the child’s education,"" says Mrin Agarwal, Founder of Finsafe India.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? Though the NPS permits partial withdrawals, it allows only 25% of the corpus after three years of joining, and this can be done only three times during the entire tenure. A premature exit before 60 years with 100% withdrawal is only possible if the corpus is less than Rs.2.5 lakh, an amount insufficient for most children's goals.""In its current form, there won’t be any uptake,"" asserts Agarwal. Rohira concurs, ""It’s a vanilla product with a lock-in, which does not make it very attractive and it may not take off. However, the government may optimise it and introduce new features later."" Iyer adds, ""This is just a start and there may be more subscriber-friendly features as we take it to the market. The regulator is proactive and open to feedback.""","Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries.

Gold import duty cut: Why Indians may not find buying gold from Dubai as attractive post Budget 2024,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-import-duty-cut-why-indians-may-not-find-buying-gold-from-dubai-as-attractive-post-budget-2024/articleshow/112097671.cms,"Gold import duty cut: Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group, estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India.

Gold import duty cut in Budget 2024: The recent reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai. Indian jewellers with stores in both India and the UAE believe that the narrowed duty differential will result in lower gold prices in India, making it less attractive for Indians to purchase gold in Dubai.The emirate had attracted gold-enthusiast Indians following a steep rise in customs duty in India in July 2022. In the fiscal 2024-25 budget, the duty on gold imports was more than halved.The duty cut is also expected to boost gold jewellery production in India, particularly the popular 'Kolkatti' jewellery from Kolkata, which is favored by Indian expats in Dubai and tourists from various countries. This move will encourage gold artisans to create new designs in both heavyweight and lightweight jewellery, attracting consumers to purchase gold from India.According to an ET report, Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group , estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India as Indian tourists who previously bought jewellery in Dubai will now prefer to shop in India. However, Indian expats living in Dubai and other customers may continue to buy from the UAE.Also Read | Gold losing sheen?

He points out that the labour cost is significantly lower in India, and with the introduction of mandatory hallmarking and HUID numbers, the purity of gold in India is no longer a concern.Furthermore, NRIs in Dubai do not receive VAT refunds, and Indians travelling abroad only receive about 60% of the VAT back on their gold purchases. Gold trade analyst Bhargav Baidya suggests that the 1% duty differential between gold jewellery in India and Dubai will be offset by Indian jewellers offering discounts to retain and attract customers.Saurabh Gadgil, chairman of PNG Jewellers, notes that Indian import duty is now on par with the US, allowing Indian jewellers to offer competitive prices compared to other countries worldwide. The reduced customs duty is expected to make gold purchases in India more attractive and convenient for Indian consumers, potentially leading to a significant shift in their gold shopping preferences.","The reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers.

Gold Bonds losing sheen

Gold losing sheen? The government has reduced its target for issuing gold bonds in the financial year 2024-25 by 38% compared to the previous interim budget goal, according to a senior official. The revised target stands at Rs 18,500 crore, down from Rs 29,638 crore estimated in the interim budget and Rs 26,852 crore (revised estimate) in 2023-24.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told ET ""The decision followed a reassessment of various factors, including investor demand, other investment products and uncertainties around the global economy, as the situation has changed since the interim budget in February.""After accounting for redemptions, the net issuances of sovereign gold bonds are now estimated at Rs 15,000 crore for this fiscal year, a significant decrease from the Rs 26,138 crore projected in the interim budget and Rs 25,352 crore in the revised estimate for 2023-24.Harish Galipelli, director at ILA Commodities India, attributed this shift to retail investors increasingly opting for equities in anticipation of better returns. He also noted that people are uncertain about the potential for further increases in gold prices in the short-to-medium term following a recent rally. Additionally, Galipelli pointed out that savings in rural areas have been impacted by retail inflation and other factors.The gold bond and gold monetisation schemes were introduced by the government in late 2015 to discourage the physical purchase of precious metals and reduce imports, thereby mitigating the negative impact on the current account deficit.The gross collection through these two schemes is now projected to be Rs 20,030 crore in 2024-25, compared to Rs 31,168 crore in the interim budget and Rs 28,240 crore (revised estimate) in the previous fiscal year. Similarly, the net collection is estimated at Rs 16,433 crore, down from Rs 27,571 crore in the interim budget and Rs 26,653 crore in the previous year. However, the estimates for the gold monetisation scheme remain unchanged from the interim budget level.Also Read | Budget 2024: Duty cuts on gold, silver, platinum, and diamonds to make jewellery more affordable The sovereign gold bond scheme targets investors who view gold as an investment, encouraging them to purchase paper gold instead of physical gold.On the other hand, the gold monetisation scheme aims to bring out idle gold held by households, temple trusts, and others to increase domestic supply. Both schemes were designed to curb gold imports, which, along with crude oil, have been significant contributors to India's current account deficit.

Devi Shetty's Narayana Health to roll out Rs 1 crore health cover for senior citizens,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/devi-shettys-narayana-health-to-roll-out-rs-1-crore-health-cover-for-senior-citizens/articleshow/114596842.cms,"BENGALURU: Dr Devi Shetty 's Narayana Health , which became the first hospital chain in India to also own an insurance company, will introduce a new insurance policy for senior citizens with coverage of up to Rs 1 crore , available at an affordable premium. Unlike some of its peers, the insurance for senior citizens will cover pre-existing conditions after conducting a comprehensive health screening before enrolling them in the insurance scheme. The health scheme is designed to support senior citizens throughout their entire lives, with no upper age limit imposed.About 15% of the heart surgeries done in India are performed by Narayana Hrudayalaya, and a substantial 30% of the surgeries are on senior citizens.""We also want to cover people who had heart surgery or angioplasty before. We will also offer top-up insurance to people who are already insured but their coverage could be anywhere between Rs 5 lakh to Rs 10 lakh. We want them to be covered up to Rs 1 crore,"" said Dr Shetty to TOI. The policy aims to provide coverage for individuals who have undergone cardiac procedures such as heart surgery or angioplasty. Additionally, Narayana Health plans to offer top-up insurance options for those who already have existing insurance coverage ranging from Rs 5 lakh to Rs 10 lakh, with the goal of increasing their total coverage up to Rs 1 crore.Amit Chhabra, chief business officer - general insurance at Policybazaar, said the Indian insurance industry has witnessed innovation recently because of insurers’ innovation and supportive regulatory reforms. “One such move has been to introduce the Rs 1 crore sum insured category in health insurance . A high sum insured like this can help growing families with less disposable income combat the medical inflation, which currently stands at 14% and is almost double the general inflation. Leading insurers like ABHI, Bajaj, Care, Niva Bupa and Tata have all championed this innovation.”Chhabra said the ever-increasing healthcare costs have had a grave impact on the medical needs of senior citizens who may not have access to a regular stream of income and have very specific medical needs. “Recent innovations specifically cater to these needs, offering day 1 coverage for chronic conditions like asthma and hypertension. Insurers are also increasingly becoming more accommodating of heart and diabetes-related risks.""Even as the govt is mulling reducing the GST rate on health insurance products, he said, “Ideally, the govt will be better off without GST on health insurance because as more people buy health insurance, it's less expensive for the govt,” Shetty added.There are three important stakeholders in healthcare delivery -- hospitals, health insurance companies, and patients. Unfortunately, hospitals do not trust health insurance companies, health insurance companies do not trust hospitals, patients do not trust both entities, and both entities do not trust patients. “This must change. Health insurance companies, hospitals, and patients can learn to trust each other if we build a different system,” said Shetty.The hospital's flagship insurance product, called Aditi, offers comprehensive family coverage for an annual premium of Rs 10,000, with a sum insured of Rs 1 crore for surgeries and Rs 5 lakh in treatment costs at Narayana Health network hospitals. Aditi was initially launched in four districts around Mysuru as part of a pilot project, before expanding to other parts of Karnataka. The pilot project aims to cover 1 lakh to 2 lakh people in the first phase of the rollout. Narayana Health has already soft-launched the scheme in Bengaluru and will be rolling out the scheme in Kolkata and New Delhi next year.However, Pankaj Nawani, CEO of CarePal Secure, believes that health insurance products typically come with waiting periods, unless the underwriting process is thorough. “While the recently announced product boasts an appealing price point, there is a lack of comprehensive information available,” he said.Shetty said even mature markets, including the US, can afford free healthcare with taxpayers’ money. Some other countries have a very high tax-to-GDP ratio between 25% to 45%, whereas our tax-to-GDP ratio is about 11.2%, and they spend between 10% to 18% of GDP on healthcare while India spends about 2.1% of GDP on healthcare. “We are in an enviable position to offer health insurance that is affordable to all citizens.”Many people, Shetty said, have silent ischemia, a condition where individuals experience ischemic episodes without any noticeable symptoms or pain. Shetty said that the company has set up a 15,000 sft advanced screening centre in one of the tech parks in the city with facilities including ultrasound, CT scan, mammogram, pap smear, and other diagnostic facilities. “Why do fit people not undergo preventive checkups? This is part of our effort to drive preventive checkups. If people don't want to go to the hospitals, we will come to your place of work,” he said.",Narayana Health is the first hospital chain in India to also own an insurance company.

Lowering ambition or postponing action raises risks and future costs. It is time for shareholders to double down on the speed of evolution of the MDBs.

Similarly, it said there were ""few meaningful signs"" of providing three times more concessional finance to needy countries.While taking note of efforts on mobilising private capital, the group said that the prospects remain a fraction of the $500 billion needed annually for private finance.Summers and Singh called upon shareholders to work on the revamp. ""Major shareholders of the MDBs must shoulder the main responsibility for this disappointing performance.

Global capability centres play spurs demand for office space,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/global-capability-centres-play-spurs-demand-for-office-space/articleshow/114601747.cms,"BENGALURU: The increasing demand for office space by global capability centres (GCCs) underscores India's pivotal role as a hub for advanced technology development. As more MNCs recognise the value of setting up their technology centres in India, the country is poised to play an even greater role in shaping the global GCC landscape.The absorption of office space by GCCs across India is projected to reach 26.1 million square feet by 2027, up from the current 21.8 million square feet, according to a report by real estate consultancy Knight Frank. The report attributes this growth to several factors, including a supportive ecosystem with political stability, a robust consumption-based economy, and a stringent regulatory framework for the financial sector. JLL India, another real estate consultancy firm, said that India is home to over 1,800 GCCs, catering to more than 1,400 unique global corporations, with an addition of over 100 new centres since 2022.JLL's report also highlighted that GCCs currently occupy more than 240 million square feet of Grade A office space across the country's top seven cities, with Bengaluru leading the pack, accounting for about 42% of the total absorption. ""In the last 18 months alone, GCCs leased an astounding 35.2 million square feet of office space. Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Chennai, captured a significant three-quarters of this leasing activity, underscoring the region's appeal with its combination of world-class infrastructure, deep talent pools, and supportive business ecosystems,"" said Samantak Das, chief economist and head of research at JLL India's Real Estate Intelligence Service.The report also said GCCs account for approximately 50% of active, ongoing space requirements across the top seven cities, signalling continued expansion and investment in the country. As GCCs evolve from cost-saving centres to transformation hubs, India's role in driving global business innovation and digital transformation is set to grow even further.Knight Frank's analysis of flex space deals across India's eight major cities from 2018 to the third quarter of 2024 shows that Bengaluru consistently leads in all deal size categories. The city topped the list with 150 deals for small-sized deals under 40,000 square feet, followed by the NCR with 96 deals.","The absorption of office space by GCCs across India is projected to reach 26.1 million square feet by 2027.

""There is no reason to let anyone else harvest that, process that and turn it into something of value. You could do it yourself.""Huang, the architect of the modern day AI revolution, said that a third of Nvidia is here in India.

"Sensex tanks over 6,000 points from peak of nearly 86,000 a month ago",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sensex-tanks-over-6000-points-from-peak-of-nearly-86000-a-month-ago/articleshow/114601416.cms,"MUMBAI:

Across-the-board selling pulled down the sensex and Nifty by nearly 1% each on Friday as dismal quarterly corporate earning numbers and strong selling by foreign funds weighed on investor sentiment. At close, the sensex was down 663 points or 0.8% at 79,402 while Nifty ended 219 points or 0.9% lower at 24,181 points. Both indices are now at levels not seen in over two and a half months.Selling, however, was more intense outside the blue chips pack. BSE’s small-cap index lost 2.4% while the mid-cap index was down 1.4%. The day’s selloff left investors poorer by a little over Rs 7 lakh crore, with BSE’s market capitalisation now at Rs 444.5 lakh crore, official data showed. The sensex has plunged 6,434 points from its Sept 26 life-high of 85,836.According to Shrikant Chouhan, head of equity research at Kotak Securities, markets corrected sharply this week as foreign funds continued to sell in the domestic market. “Market sentiment was also weighed down by weaker-than-expected (quarterly) earnings numbers and weak commentary (from the companies).” He added that going forward, geopolitical developments will likely keep the equity markets and prices of certain commodities volatile. “In the coming weeks, key events include the US elections and the US FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) meet.”Technically, a decisive break below 24,000 points for Nifty could worsen the outlook for the market, Ajit Mishra, SVP (research) at Religare Broking, said. “In the event of a rebound, 24,500 will now serve as a strong resistance level.”Selling by foreign funds — at a new monthly record of net outflow of nearly Rs 90,000 crore — is the main reason for the market’s slide, brokers and dealers said. So far in Oct, foreign portfolio investors were net sellers in stocks on each of the 18 trading sessions, data from NSDL showed.Although domestic funds have been big buyers with a net inflow at nearly Rs 1.1 lakh crore, still they could not neutralise the strong stock liquidation by foreign funds, they said. However, domestic funds have provided some cushion to the impact of selling by FPIs.DIIs have been strong buyers absorbing the selling and mitigating the fall, Vinod Nair, head of research at Geojit Financial Services, said. “Due to the (current) selling, the domestic market is expected to reach (an) oversold territory. We can expect a tactical bounceback in the near-term.”In Friday’s market, of the 30 sensex stocks, 21 closed lower while nine closed with gains. Among the gainers was ITC, with a 2.2% rise, which announced a strong set of quarterly numbers on Thursday.

"Edible oils costlier in festive season, palm oil price up 37% in a month",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/edible-oils-costlier-in-festive-season-palm-oil-price-up-37-in-a-month/articleshow/114599702.cms,"NEW DELHI:

In the midst of the festive season, edible oil prices have spiked, with palm oil prices rising as much as 37% in the past one month, heaping pressure on household budgets and making it expensive for restaurants, hotels and sweet shops which use the oil for preparing popular snacks.The price of mustard oil, used in several households, has surged by 29% in one month. The spurt in oil prices came at a time when retail inflation jumped to a nine-month high of 5.5% in Sept, led by high vegetable and food prices, dashing hopes of a cut in interest rates by the RBI for now.The prices of a large chunk of edible oils have soared after govt increased import duty on crude soybean, palm and sunflower oils last month. What has added to the price rise is a significant increase in global rates in the past one month. Govt increased the import duties on crude palm, soybean, and sunflower to 27.5% from 5.5% and duty on refined edible oil has also been raised to 35.7% from 13.7% effective from September 14. These constitute the major chunk of the country’s edible oil import basket.Officials said the global prices of crude palm, soybean, and sunflower have risen by approximately 10.6%, 16.8%, and 12.3% since last month. India meets around 58% of its edible oil demand through imports. India is the second-largest consumer of edible oil and the biggest importer of vegetable oils.Sources said consumers will have to live with higher prices for the next few months as there is hardly any chance of reducing import duty. Govt had earlier said, “These adjustments are part of the govt’s ongoing efforts to bolster domestic oilseed farmers, especially with the new soybean and groundnut crops expected to arrive in markets from October 2024.” Even industry sources said farmers need to get a good price for oilseeds, and for that, the current regime of import duty needs to continue.The rise in global prices of key edible oils has come as a surprise, impacting the prices of all cooking oils. Govt had said the duty hike was done considering several factors such as increased global production of soybean, oil palm, and other oilseeds; higher global ending stocks compared to last year; and falling prices due to surplus production.B V Mehta, executive director of SEA, said while the immediate price rise seems significant, there has been very little change if seen across the past few years. “If we want to make ourselves self-sufficient in edible oil, we have to encourage farmers to bring more areas under oilseeds. That will happen only when farmers get good prices for years and we don’t go for excess import of oil.”","Price of mustard oil, used in several households, has surged by 29% in one month.

"Tesla rallies most in over a decade, adds close to $150bn in market value on Musk's bold EV forecast",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/tesla-rallies-most-in-over-a-decade-adds-close-to-150bn-in-market-value-on-musks-bold-ev-forecast/articleshow/114565617.cms,"Tesla reported a third-quarter margin that surpassed Wall Street expectations.

Tesla's shares experienced a significant surge on Thursday, closing up nearly 22%, marking their biggest single-day gain in over a decade. CEO Elon Musk 's optimistic forecast of increasing sales reassured investors that the company's core business of selling electric cars remains a priority. Musk predicted a 20%-30% sales growth for the upcoming year and announced plans to launch an affordable vehicle in the first half of 2025. He also highlighted efforts to reduce production costs, which led to improved margins in the third quarter.The stock's session high reached $262.2, with trading volumes of approximately 200 million shares. This rally erased recent losses that stemmed from concerns over Musk's focus on new projects, such as the recently unveiled robotaxi. The company's market value increased by nearly $150 billion at the close of trading. Ed Egilinsky, managing director at investment company Direxion, suggested that the rally might be attributed to a relief rally, as the results exceeded expectations, and some short covering, with short interest on Tesla stock at 2.33% at the end of September, according to LSEG data.Tesla reported a third-quarter margin that surpassed Wall Street expectations, and the labor and material costs of manufacturing vehicles, known as the cost of goods sold per vehicle, dropped to its lowest-ever level of about $35,100. The company recorded $326 million in revenue for its autopilot software, Full Self Driving (FSD), which is used in Cybertruck and other autonomous features. Seth Goldstein, equity strategist at Morningstar, believes that while FSD contributed to the margin expansion, the primary driver was the reduction in unit production costs, and over time, FSD should lead to higher long-term margin expansion.However, not all investors are likely to be satisfied with Tesla's reassurances. Ross Gerber, CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management and a prominent Tesla investor, expressed his preference for Musk to focus on the fundamental businesses rather than robotaxis and AI. Tesla shares are trading at 72.75 times its 12-month forward earnings estimates, compared to 5.94 times for legacy automaker Ford Motor and 30.79 for technology giant Microsoft. At least seven brokerages raised their price targets on the stock, with a median price target of $221, according to LSEG data.Meanwhile, the S&P 500 recorded its first daily gain of the week, although the overall sentiment remained somewhat fragile. Most sectors within the S&P were in negative territory, as other earnings reports and pressure from lower, but still elevated Treasury yields weighed on the market.The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, a key benchmark, eased to 4.20% on the day after hitting a three-month high in the previous session. During Wednesday's trading, the yield reached as high as 4.26%, contributing to losses across all three major equity indexes.Stocks have eased from record levels over the past few sessions due to a reassessment of bets on the Federal Reserve's rate cuts, rising Treasury yields, corporate earnings and uncertainty surrounding the upcoming US election.(With inputs from agencies)","Tesla's shares experienced a significant surge on Thursday, closing up nearly 22%, marking their biggest single-day gain in over a decade.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella 's compensation for fiscal 2024 increased by 63%, reaching $79.1 million, a company filing revealed on Thursday. This surge was primarily due to stock awards.

The European Union fined LinkedIn €310 million ($335 million) on Thursday over violations of the bloc's strict data privacy laws. Ireland’s Data Protection Commission (DPC), acting as LinkedIn's primary regulator in the EU, reprimanded the platform for issues regarding the ""lawfulness, fairness, and transparency"" of its personal data processing practices for advertising.Following an investigation, the DPC found that LinkedIn, owned by Microsoft , lacked a lawful basis to collect and use personal data for targeting ads, breaching the General Data Protection Regulation ( GDPR ). The DPC ordered LinkedIn to comply with EU rules.Deputy Commissioner Graham Doyle emphasized that processing personal data ""without an appropriate legal basis"" is a serious violation of privacy rights in the EU.LinkedIn responded by stating that it believes it has adhered to the rules but is working to align its advertising practices with regulatory requirements.","The European Union fined LinkedIn €310 million ($335 million) on Thursday over violations of the bloc's strict data privacy laws.

Ethereum (ETH) has been tipped to hit $5,000, while SUI ’s recent downturn shifts traders to IntelMarkets (INTL) for its explosive potential.The cryptocurrency market has given rise to both a plethora of slow growth machines and sharp retracements, while big players are constantly looking for the next hot opportunity. Ethereum (ETH) has been a favourite of crypto for a long time, but there are still some experts who are betting on the price of tokens to increase up to $5,000, but carefully.On the other hand, SUI is falling behind, compelling many traders to turn to rising AI crypto like IntelMarkets (INTL), which has fantastic potential for growth.Ethereum (ETH) is amongst one of the top-regarded cryptocurrencies in the market which continues to develop its network with innovative developments, including Ethereum 2.0, enhancing scalability and security. Ethereum maintained a stable presence with deep integration into the dApp ecosystem, NFT and DeFi.As of now Ethereum is trading around $2,630 compared to the all-time high of $4,891 reached in November 2021. After that, Ethereum’s price movement has gone up and down, influenced by macroeconomic factors such as inflation, fast global market correction, and government interventions.Predictions are conservative at best, predicting Ethereum could reach $5,000 by the end of 2024 with increasing institutional interest and adoption of Ethereum’s blockchain to build decentralised applications. Ethereum’s ecosystem and popularity in and of itself are important enough to make it a safer place to buy assets for the long haul despite the recent underperformance.Being a Layer1 blockchain project, SUI brought innovation to the space with its focus on scalability by offering a scalable, robust, and secure development platform. It surprised investors by hitting its all-time high less than two weeks ago, a whopping 30% monthly increase to $2.36.Currently, SUI is trading hands at $1.95, noting a 7% decrease today. After losing its $2 support some investors are looking for the next opportunity that will guarantee them the same success as SUI.IntelMarkets is an upcoming DeFi novel AI-powered project which intends to change the $36 billion global crypto trading scene . The platform is powered by self-learning AI bots to process massive volumes of data, execute trades in multiple asset classes, and optimise trading strategies in real time, is revolutionising.The project has already managed to receive significant traction during the presale, raising over $1.5 million and capturing early investor interest to get huge returns. IntelMarkets tokens, priced at just $0.036 with an expected 75x return during market launch, provide a low entry point into the market. These tailwinds make it a strong choice for traders seeking greater explosive growth than Ethereum or even SUI can currently bring to the table.With Ethereum’s price target of hitting $5,000 and SUI depressed, traders are looking to newer, more exciting assets. Due to this change, the company behind IntelMarkets (INTL), which is powered by AI, is about to exploit these opportunities as its trading platform is going to have an unprecedented growth. For those looking to grab a piece of the next bull market pie, IntelMarkets (INTL) crypto may be one of the top cryptos to invest in today as its presale flies off the shelves.","Ethereum (ETH) has been tipped to hit $5,000, while SUI ’s recent downturn shifts traders to IntelMarkets (INTL) for its explosive potential.

Boeing reports $6.2 billion quarterly loss ahead of vote by union workers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/boeing-reports-6-2-billion-quarterly-loss-ahead-of-vote-by-union-workers/articleshow/114508250.cms,"Boeing suffered a staggering $6.2 billion loss in third-quarter loss, primarily due to labor disputes and expenses associated with its commercial and defense aircraft programs.The aviation major faces a crucial day on Wednesday, as it introduces its new CEO, Kelly Ortberg, during his inaugural earnings call and awaits the outcome of a machinists' strike that has crumbled aircraft production for over a month.Boeing has not registered profit since 2018, and the situation is expected to worsen before improving. The company reported a loss of $9.97 per share for the period ending September 30, with an adjusted loss of $10.44 per share, aligning with analysts' expectations polled by Zacks Investment Research. Revenue amounted to $17.84 billion, matching Wall Street estimates. Company shares experienced a slight decline of 1% in pre-market trading.Ortberg acknowledged that restoring Boeing to its former status will take time. ""It will take time to return Boeing to its former legacy, but with the right focus and culture, we can be an iconic company and aerospace leader once again,"" he said.Ortberg, who assumed the CEO role in August, admitted the erosion of trust in the company, excessive debt, and significant performance shortcomings that have left many customers dissatisfied. However, he also highlighted Boeing's strengths, such as its substantial backlog of airplane orders worth half a trillion dollars.He has already initiated large-scale layoffs and come up with a plan to raise sufficient funds to prevent bankruptcy. He must also persuade federal regulators that Boeing is addressing its safety culture and is prepared to ramp up production of the 737 Max, a critical step in generating much-needed revenue.However, Boeing cannot manufacture any new 737s until it resolves the five-week-old strike by 33,000 machinists, which has halted production at assembly plants in the Seattle region.Tony Bancroft, a portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds and a Boeing investor, said that Ortberg ""got a lot on his plate, but he probably is laser-focused on getting this negotiation completed. That's the closest alligator to the boat.""Meanwhile, the most significant development is expected to unfold on Wednesday evening when the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers announces the results of a vote by striking workers on whether to accept Boeing's offer and return to work.The proposal includes a 35% pay increase over a four-year period, a $7,000 ratification bonus, and the preservation of performance bonuses that Boeing had initially sought to remove.The company has remained resolute in its opposition to the union's demand for the reinstatement of the traditional pension plan, which was frozen ten years ago. Nonetheless, older employees would receive a modest increase in their monthly pension payments.At the picket line outside Boeing's Everett factory in Washington, some machinists are encouraging their colleagues to reject the offer.""The pension should have been the top priority. We all said that was our top priority, along with wage. Now is the prime opportunity in a prime time to get our pension back, and we all need to stay out and dig our heels in,"" said Larry Best, a customer-quality coordinator with 38 years of experience at Boeing.He also believes that the pay increase should be 40% over three years to compensate for the prolonged period of wage stagnation, which is now compounded by high inflation.Bartley Stokes Sr, who began working at Boeing in 1978, also shared his perspective. He said, ""You can see we got a great turnout today. I'm pretty sure that they don't like the contract because that's why I'm here. We're out here in force, and we're going to show our solidarity and stick with our union brothers and sisters and vote this thing down because they can do better.""","Boeing reported a $6.2 billion loss in third-quarter loss, primarily due to labor disputes and expenses associated with its commercial and defense aircraft programs.

Foreign debt financing by Brazilian issuers surges in 2024,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/foreign-debt-financing-by-brazilian-issuers-surges-in-2024/articleshow/114505501.cms,"Foreign debt financing by Brazilian issuers is surging again, reaching a three-year high in 2024, as local companies seek to refinance existing obligations or make new investments.In the first nine months of the year, companies, financial institutions and the federal government issued a total of $17.6 billion worth in foreign bonds, compared with $15.5 billion in the full year of 2023, according to the Brazilian Financial and Capital Markets Association ( Anbima ).The biggest issuer so far in the year was the National Treasury, with $6.5 billion in bonds, including a $2 billion offer of sustainable debt . Issuances by the government serve as benchmarks for private offers, according to bankers.Brazilian companies, meanwhile, have increased their foreign borrowings in recent months, attracted by lower rates as well as a larger pool of long-term investors abroad than at home.Together, financial institutions and companies have raised $11.1 billion in international bonds as of September, compared with $11.3 billion in the full year of 2023, according to Anbima.Local companies are often able to issue debt at longer maturities outside of Brazil, according to Carlos Moura, chief financial and investor relations officer at fuel company Raizen , which also tapped the green bond market twice this year, raising a total of $2.5 billion. Both offers were oversubscribed.Offering green debt securities can substantially increase demand, according to specialists, but non-environmental bonds issued by Brazilian companies with high credit ratings have also found good appetite from investors in 2024.Large primary materials producers, such as petrochemical producer Braskem SA and iron-ore miner Vale SA , have equally taken advantage of their access to foreign debt financing.""A lot of investor cash was built during the rising rate environment and appetite for emerging markets is super strong,"" said Ian Linnell, president of Fitch Ratings.""If you look at the BRICS, Russia is persona non grata and China has significant domestic economic problems. By contrast, India has a good growth story and Brazil, while no longer investment grade, has a solid double B credit and a established policy framework,"" he added. BRICS is an intergovernmental organization comprising several countries, among them Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.While clearly growing, foreign debt offers by local issuers have not reached the peak of 2020 and 2021. In 2020, Brazilian debt offers in the foreign market surpassed $25 billion, according to Anbima. Investors at that time had a lot of money to spend and issuers took advantage of the low rates, according to bankers. Now, after holding borrowing costs, the US Federal Reserve has again started cutting rates, potentially leading more firms to seek the US market, according to Matthew Poulter at global law firm Linklaters, which has been advising companies seeking to issue debt outside of Brazil.""The advantage we have here is being able to count on the foreign market in a complementary way to what we have in the local market,"" said Guilherme Maranhao, head of the capital markets forum at Anbima.","In the first nine months of the year, companies, financial institutions and the federal government issued a total of $17.6 billion worth in foreign bonds.
