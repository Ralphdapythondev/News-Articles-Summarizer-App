New Tax Regime: What else can be done?

Income Tax Expectations Budget 2024 : The Modi government has been looking to make the new income tax regime more attractive for the common man, middle class and salaried income taxpayers. Raising of basic exemption limit , introduction of standard deduction , and tweaking of tax slabs and rates under the new tax regime signal that the government wants taxpayers to shift to the new regime.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present the Union Budget 2024 on July 23, 2024 and personal tax experts are of the opinion that some changes in the new income tax regime can be expected.What can be done to make the new income tax regime more attractive than the old tax regime, especially for individuals who have done their tax planning based on the old regime? TOI Online Survey of personal tax experts finds out:Also Check | Budget 2024 Live Updates All personal tax experts unanimously agree that to make the new income tax more attractive for taxpayers, especially for middle class salaried taxpayers , the government needs to tweak it to introduce more deductions and exemptions.One common deduction that experts believe should make way into the new income tax regime, and one that makes the old tax regime more lucrative for taxpayers, is housing loan deduction.Preeti Sharma, Partner, Tax & Regulatory Services, BDO India LLP says that currently under the new tax regime, exemption against interest paid on home loan taken for a self-occupied or vacant property is not available. “This provision may be relooked at and be allowed under the new tax regime,” she tells TOI.Agrees Kuldip Kumar, Partner at Mainstay Tax Advisors, saying, “the deduction for interest on housing loan may be introduced to make it (new tax regime) better for those who still chose the old tax regime.”Also Read | Income Tax Expectations Budget 2024: What are the ideal new tax regime slabs, rates for middle class, salaried? TOI Online Survey findings Yet another recommendation is to increase the basic exemption limit and standard deduction under the new regime.“Increase in the basic exemption limit from Rs 3 to 5 lakhs, raise the standard deduction to Rs 100,000,” Surabhi Marwah, Tax Partner, EY India tells TOI.Chander Talreja, Partner, Vialto Partners says that the basic exemption limit under the new tax regime may be further raised by at least Rs 50,000, which will benefit all individual taxpayers (salaried or non-salaried) opting for the new income tax regime. This will help increase purchasing power of the taxpayers which may further boost the investments.Aarti Raote, Partner, Deloitte India says raising the basic exemption limit to Rs 5 lakh and introducing the 30% tax rate to the income category of Rs 20 lakh & above as against the existing limit of Rs 15 lakh will give tax relief to all. She also believes that the standard deduction should be increased to Rs 1 lakh from the existing Rs 50,000 limit.Aarti Raote is of the view that to make the new regime more attractive the government should consider allowing deductions for employee contributions to the NPS within the new tax regime framework.Vialto’s Chander Talreja notes that the employer’s contribution to the NPS is allowed as a deduction under the new income tax regime. “For the non-salaried individuals, while this deduction is not applicable, they do not even get any deduction for their own contribution. This is a hardship and the government may consider introducing deduction in respect of an individual's contribution to NPS under section 80CCD(1B), currently capped at Rs 50,000. This will benefit salaried as well as non-salaried individuals,” he tells TOI.Also Read | Budget 2024 income tax expectations: Raise basic exemption limit, standard deduction and NPS benefits for taxpayers Preeti Sharma believes that in order to promote savings towards retirement, the government may consider allowing deductions available under section 80C of the Act, under the new tax regime as well.Aarti Raote says that in line with the government’s agenda of affordable housing and green energy, it is anticipated that specific deductions towards mortgage repayments on affordable housing or electric vehicles be provided under the new tax regime besides incentivizing taxpayers for installation or adoption of solar energy equipment.However, Kuldip Kumar, Partner at Mainstay Tax Advisors notes that the government has already rationalized the slabs and the rates in its Budget 2023. “I am not expecting that something more would be done except discontinuing the old tax regime whereby by default everyone is in the new regime,” he tells TOI.","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present the Union Budget 2024 on July 23, 2024.

Wall Street got a reality check after a disappointing start of the megacap earnings season fueled concern the artificial-intelligence frenzy that has powered the bull market might be overblown.A selloff in big tech sent the S&P 500 to its worst day since December 2022, ending the best stretch without a 2% drop since the start of the global financial crisis.Losses were more pronounced in the Nasdaq 100, which tumbled over 3.5%. Alphabet Inc. slid 5% after sinking more resources into its drive to outmatch rivals in AI, with spending higher than analysts expected. Tesla Inc.’s profit miss and the Robotaxi delay spurred a 12% stock plunge.“Investors are finally waking up to all that AI spend and realizing it is much more of an expense right now rather than a revenue generator,” said Peter Boockvar at The Boock Report.Wednesday’s session was another lesson in the “concentration risk” bears see as latent in a market whose upside has owed disproportionately to a narrow cohort of massive gainers. For a fourth straight session — and the 10th time in 11 days — the performance of smaller companies exceeded larger ones, evidence investor tastes have shifted from the megacap tech names that have come to dominate benchmark indexes.The Treasury curve steepened on bets the Federal Reserve is close to cutting rates. Former New York Fed President William Dudley called for lower borrowing costs — preferably at next week’s gathering. For many analysts, such a move would be worrisome as it would indicate officials rushing to avoid a recession.The loonie fell as the Bank of Canada cut rates, focused on “downside risks.” The yen hit the highest since May amid an unwind in carry trades.To Steve Clayton at Hargreaves Lansdown, this could be the year markets start talking about the “So-So Seven,” noting that results from Tesla and Alphabet are not enough to maintain their momentum.“The market is not impressed with the start of earnings season for the mega tech stocks,” said Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB. “There was a lot resting on these results and we don’t think that they give clear answers to questions about the effectiveness and profit potential for AI right now.”After driving the rally in stocks for most of 2024, big tech slammed into a wall. Traders rotated from megacaps to lagging parts of the market, spurred by bets on Fed rate cuts and concern AI still needs to pay off.“Tech’s problem isn’t just that earnings are less than perfect, but the group is still caught up in the violent rotation trade that kicked off with the June CPI,” said Vital Knowledge’s Adam Crisafulli. “Many assumed the anti-tech rotation would be ephemeral and the fact it’s proving durable is compounding anxiety toward the group and spurring additional selling pressure.”The drubbing in these stocks has seen some of the air come out of valuations. While that’s something that could argue in favor of dip buying, the earnings season is just getting started. Apple Inc, Microsoft Corp, Amazon.com Inc and Meta Platforms Inc are all due toTo Jose Torres at Interactive Brokers, the equity correction is far from over. “Yesterday we wrote that a 10% to 15% correction was in the cards this quarter, historically the worst period of the year,” Torres said. “This quarter, the valuation concerns are paired with front-loaded gains, irrational exuberance, a high bar for earnings estimates and a presidential election.”In fact, the second-quarter US earnings season is off to a weaker start than usual.Among S&P 500 companies that reported results, profits beat analyst estimates by the smallest margin since the end of 2022 — while sales surprises were the worst in at least two years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.“We are still looking for volatility to increase moving through the second half of 2024 - with the potential for a 10% to 15% correction in benchmarks like the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100,” said Dan Wantrobski at Janney Montgomery Scott. “Our work does not point to secular/structural downturn at this time, but rather a pause in the reflationary expansion cycle that began a few years ago.”Just as earnings roll in, a key technical indicator in the US stock market sat close to historic extremes — a crucial gauge that has foretold past selloffs.Known as the “the 200-DMA” — an abbreviation of 200-day moving average — the gauge measures how the S&P 500 is performing against that longer-term measure. At one point last week, the benchmark was trading as much as 15% above it, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.While the gap has since narrowed — to 9% through Wednesday’s close — that kind of gulf above 12% still preceded declines for the index in 2011, 2018 and 2021. Although that does not necessarily mean the market is about to tank, it is a warning sign for investors concerned about lofty tech valuations and concentration risk.","A selloff in big tech sent the S&P 500 to its worst day since December 2022.

Udupi-born Shetty, whose net worth was over $3 billion in 2019, racked up $4 billion in debt allegedly due to inflated financials of NMC through fraudulent loans, credit facilities, and fraudulent related-party round tripping transactions.In a recent ruling, the New York Supreme Court has dismissed Shetty's claim seeking damages amounting to $8 billion in favour of an alternative forum following motions submitted by defendants Bank of Baroda, Credit Europe Bank and Ernst & Young (EY).The other individual defendants in the case include two former top NMC executives Prasanth Manghat and Promoth Manghat.Justice Cohen of the New York State Supreme Court decided the case in favour of Bank of Baroda and other defendants, dismissing the case based on the ground of forum non conveniens. The principle of forum non conveniens allows a court in the United States to refuse to exercise its judicial authority when it determines that the court would be an inappropriate venue for the case, and when a suitable alternative court is available. A majority of the alleged transactions and events that are relevant to the case occurred outside the US.The court determined that New York was not the appropriate jurisdiction to hear the case, considering numerous factors. The presence of a single Bank of Baroda branch in New York was deemed insufficient to overcome the plaintiffs' lack of residency in the forum.When TOI reached out to Shetty, he said, “We are disappointed and strongly disagree with the New York Commercial Division Court’s non-merits decision to dismiss the lawsuit in favor of an alternative forum, especially in light of the evidence my team submitted showing billions of dollars of fraudulent transactions being structured through Bank of Baroda’s New York branch. In any event, we will continue to pursue Bank of Baroda and the other defendants whether by taking the appeal to the NY Appellate Division or pursuing our lawsuit in an alternative forum,” he said in a statement to TOI.Separately, Shetty told TOI that the case will be moved to the Abu Dhabi court. “It's daylight robbery. How can the case be dismissed? Justice delayed is justice denied,"" he told TOI.Dharmendra Chatur, partner in law firm Poovayya & Co, said, ""This is an excellent victory for Bank of Baroda, especially because of the stakes involved and the absence of connection with the jurisdiction (New York). The joint efforts of the Bank and other corporate defendants in the motion to dismiss led to this outcome. The plaintiffs will now have to identify a more appropriate jurisdiction in which to re-file their claims."" The Bank of Baroda was advised on aspects of the litigation by Poovayya & Co. Shetty owes over $250 million to Bank of Baroda. An email sent to Bank of Baroda and EY didn’t elicit a response till the time of going to press.The amended complaint filed by Shetty last year showed that he relinquished day-to-day management responsibilities in late 2012 to the individual defendants. The complaint also showed that individual defendants used the larger off-balance-sheet loans to pay back prior obligations, which was required to keep the Ponzi scheme going. “In addition, the individual defendants siphoned off and unlawfully distributed proceeds from the larger off-balance-sheet loans to themselves and their co-conspirators, including Baroda, CEB, and EY executives and other employees,” it said.“Unbeknownst to Shetty, the Manghat Brothers used his sterling reputation and fortune to further the defendants’ conspiracy and fraud in a variety of ways, including by forging Shetty’s signatures on purported personal guarantees tied to the off-balance sheet loans (including the supply chain finance loans) fraudulently procured by the individual defendants.It alleged the defendants’ fraud has caused Shetty over $7 billion in damages, including from purported personal guaranty exposure, massive reputational damage, the loss of his equity in the group companies, and enormous expenses to defend himself against enforcement actions on the forged guarantees.","Dr. BR Shetty, the Dubai-based billionaire founder of NMC Healthcare, has encountered a fresh setback.

This, in turn, led to under reporting of income. These individuals offered the overseas income net of tax and at the same time claimed a foreign tax credit (FTC) for taxes withheld overseas against their India tax liability.In short - they got a double advantage.The Budget proposes to amend section 198 of the I-T Act to include income taxes paid outside India for the purpose of computing the income of the taxpayer who is liable to tax in India. This proposal will be effective financial year 2024-25.Parizad Sirwalla, partner and head (global mobility services tax) at KPMG India, said, ""The amendment is more clarificatory in nature. This was always the correct position. As explained in the explanatory memorandum. It appears that some taxpayers (including companies) were not doing so and hence this amendment was introduced making it abundantly clear.""She gives an illustration. An Indian employee of an Indian subsidiary of a German company was granted shares under the global Esop plan. He was eligible to receive dividend of 100 euros on such shares. According to German law, 10 euros was withheld and the balance was transferred to the employee's Indian bank account.""The correct tax position was always to offer the entire 100 euros as income and claim 10 euros as a double tax relief (credit against Indian tax liability on such 100 euros),"" KPMG India's Sirwalla added.Ameya Kunte, founder, Globeview Advisors, points out a few decisions where overseas tax was not held part of the total income assessable to tax in India - these now stand overturned.""The MP high court in the case of Yawar Rashid had held that the tax deducted at source outside India from foreign dividends and interest income was not part of the total income and thus not assessable in the hands of the taxpayer.

Budget 2024: Big Relief To Indian Taxpayers | Changes In New Regime Slabs | Nirmala Sitharaman

NEW DELHI: Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Wednesday said most people will be better off under the new capital gains tax structure, despite the indexation benefit being withdrawn for property, and asserted that govt decided on the new structure after undertaking an elaborate exercise.“This perception that you will be at a disadvantage is not realistic, it’s absolutely not correct… In almost every case people have a lower tax burden under this system.The small or the medium people who are going into the market or property investments are going to benefit from it,” she told TOI in an interview.On Tuesday, she had announced a reduction in long term capital gains tax on property and gold from 20% to 12.5%, while withdrawing the benefit to adjust it for inflation. This came with the provision that indexation benefit will be available for properties bought up to 2001.The FM said the amendments have been proposed with the intent to simplify the tax regime and bring all asset classes at par.Sitharaman said the Union Budget presented on Tuesday was a continuation of the interim budget and insisted that the measures announced for Andhra Pradesh were part of the commitments given at the time of bifurcation of the state . “In Bihar’s case can anyone deny the devastation that happens because of Kosi flooding?” she said.She also said that the skilling plan through internship was voluntary for companies and she had received suggestions for such a scheme from various industry bodies. “We're not forcing anybody, we've had a lot of discussion with CII and Ficci and they thought it is possible to do it. It will actually help because they will have industry-ready people, who can be employed.”She hit out at the Opposition, saying, “This brazen method of building a false narrative, repeating it and restating it with the hope that it will stick has been tried in the Lok Sabha elections. They are trying it even now.”Along with the calculations released by the Central Board of Direct Taxes under different scenarios, tax authorities said, “Nominal real estate returns are generally in the region of 12-16% per annum, much higher than inflation. The indexation for inflation in in the region of 4-5%, depending on the period of holding. Therefore, substantial tax savings are expected for a vast majority of taxpayers.”The statement further said that the new regime is beneficial for five-year old properties under the new regime which have seen an appreciation of 1.7 times or more. Similarly, for 10 years, if the value rises 2.4 times the new mechanism is seen to be beneficial. Ditto for property purchased in 2009-10 with appreciation of 4.9 times or more, the tax department said.“It's only where returns are low (less than about 9-11% per annum) that the earlier tax rate is beneficial, but such low returns in real estate are unrealistic and rare (less than 10% of cases),” it said.Revenue secretary Sanjay Malhotra told TOI that benefits of reinvesting the capital gains in a new property and parking the funds in tax-exempt 54EC bonds issued by REC are intact.Asked about the revenue impact, he said that the Centre may end up losing revenue as most taxpayers are likely to gain from the decision.“Simplification of any tax structure has benefits of ease of compliance, including computation filing, maintenance of records. This also removes the differential rates for various asset classes,” CBDT said.","Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman says most people will be better off under the new capital gains tax structure.

Budget 2024 NPS Tax savings

Budget 2024 new NPS benefits: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has announced additional tax benefits for salaried taxpayers investing in the National Pension Scheme . The Union Budget has taken steps to promote retirement planning by enhancing the tax advantage on NPS contributions and introducing a new option for minor children in the pension system .The deduction under Section 80CCD(2) is set to be raised from 10% to 14% of the basic salary. This section permits you to contribute up to 10% of your basic pay to NPS tax-free. Previously, only government employees were eligible for the 14% deduction, but now this benefit has been extended to the private sector as well.“It is proposed to increase the amount of deduction allowed to an employer in respect of his contribution to a pension scheme referred to in section 80CCD, from the extent of 10% to the extent of 14% of the salary of the employee. Further, a non-government employee in the new tax regime shall be allowed deduction of an amount not exceeding 14% of the employee’s salary in place of 10%,” the Budget speech document reads.Also Check | Latest income tax slabs FY 2024-25 For instance, if your basic salary is Rs 1 lakh, your employer can contribute Rs 10,000 (10% of basic pay) to the NPS on your behalf, which is exempt from tax. This deduction will be increased to Rs 14,000. Previously, only government employees were eligible for the 14% deduction, but it has now been extended to the private sector as well.As is evident from the table, if your basic pay is Rs 25,000 per month, then the additional tax saved is Rs 624. At a basic pay of Rs 1 lakh per month, the additional tax benefit is almost Rs 10,000 and at high basic pay levels of Rs 6 lakh, the extra tax saving would be over Rs 1 lakh!""The NPS proposals in the budget take significant steps towards the government's goal of making India a pensioned society by 2047,"" Sriram Iyer, CEO of HDFC Pension was quoted as saying by ET.While the new tax regime offers the NPS benefit only under Section 80CCD (2), the old tax regime allows three deductions under Sections 80CCD (1) (Rs 1.5 lakh), 80CCD (1B) (Rs 50,000) and 80CCD (2). However, the higher limit of 14% is only for those who opt for the new tax regime.""With the employers' contribution increasing to 14%, employees will have extended savings now. This will help in retirement planning, works as an option that is at par with the Provident Fund as per the given limits for employees, and serves an incentive to increase the tax-paying user base for the government,"" says Dinesh Rohira, CEO & Founder, 5nance.com.Also Read | Budget 2024 Income Tax changes Explained: Salaried taxpayers to save Rs 17,500! The budget has also introduced a new scheme called NPS Vatsalya, which encourages long-term savings for children by their parents. Under this scheme, parents and guardians can contribute to the NPS account of minor children below the age of 18.Once the child turns 18, the plan can be seamlessly converted into a regular NPS account. ""NPS Vatsalya is a notable innovation that allows parents or guardians to contribute to a child's pension from birth, ensuring a strong foundation for future retirement savings through compounded returns,"" says Iyer.","The deduction under Section 80CCD(2) is set to be raised from 10% to 14% of the basic salary.

Budget's big job: Get back BJP's lost votes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budgets-big-job-get-back-bjps-lost-votes/articleshow/111973325.cms,"The best clue to the politics of this Budget ? The acronym emblazoned on the backdrop of Nirmala Sitharaman 's post-Budget presser. First letters of ten different 'priorities' made up that acronym - EMPLOYMENT.Fresh from an where BJP lost its single party majority in part because many voters were unhappy with the lack of decent paying jobs , FM wrote that political lesson into her Budget, via a raft of incentives for industry, both big and small, to employ more people.In a country where the young are the largest population cohort, disaffected young people are a political handicap. More so, when millions of them are college-educated and therefore relatively immune to the promise of welfare schemes. So, Sitharaman put their concerns front and centre, to win back votes that in 2014 and 2019 had played a pivotal role in giving BJP impressive majorities.What will be interesting is how the Budget's unconventional approach to job creation pans out, both in terms of actual jobs created and politically. FM has bet on incentives for private sector employers. If companies respond - and that's a definite 'if' - there will be job creation in the formal sector.There's a rider here. What happens if companies don't respond to the nudges GOI has given on taking on more people? Will the nudge become something stronger?The key question is 'how many jobs'. Because politically, for the Budget to make an appreciable difference to the perception that Modi govt ignored unemployment, a substantial number of new, steady jobs will have to be offered by the private sector. This question is even sharper politically when it comes to the internship programme. After one year, will the new interns get jobs? Or will they be unemployed young people with job experience? If most interns end up in the latter category, BJP's political difficulty over the jobs question may not lessen dramatically.This will be true even if BJP's own argument - that it didn't get enough credit for creating an enabling environment for creating jobs in sectors like the gig economy - remains valid.The Budget takes forward previous attempts on skilling by announcing new schemes. GOI's skilling programmes have had a patchy record so far. If this Budget changes that, many young voters will have a better shot at earning a decent livelihood. That has an obvious positive political impact.The catch, of course, is whether this Budget will do this job more skilfully than previous ones.There's a clear political plan in the Budget's MSME approach, too. First, because labour-intensive MSMEs, now helped by a friendlier credit regime, are reliable job-creators. Second, because MSME promoters contain a large subset of small businessmen generally thought to be sympathetic to BJP.Ally management was always going to be a priority for a coalition govt's budget. On this, Sitharaman's politics is better than that of many other coalition govt FMs. Instead of giving big bags of money to Nitish and Naidu, the budget allocates capex for specific projects, ensuring the help to allies is in tune with the larger focus of building infra, and also trying to ensure that whatever's allocated is spent better. Roads, bridges in Bihar and big irrigation projects in Andhra can deliver both politically and economically. Plus, it's also fiscally prudent.To that extent, therefore, Congress's charge that this was a 'save the govt"" scheme needs to be qualified.Women, who are voting in larger numbers in every successive election, are another big political constituency. The Budget allocates Rs 3 lakh crore for schemes for women and girls. These are likely to be implemented through self-help groups. These schemes aim to double down on the success of both labharti and lakhpati didi initiatives. 2024 elections showed that women vote can act as a counter in regions where other voter groups are dissatisfied with BJP.The investing classes won't be too happy about the Budget, what with capital gains tax burden going up. Urban middle classes, too, will grumble about the smallish tax benefits accruing from tweaks in income taxes. But these are not the voting classes. Right now, BJP wants to get back the votes it lost - that's, basically, the politics of this budget.","The Budget's unconventional approach to job creation pans out, both in terms of actual jobs created and politically.

It’s filled with ups and downs that should be embraced and enjoyed,” says Suprabha Mysore , vice president of software development at TransUnion , the US-based consumer credit reporting agency.After a BE in computer science and three years with Nokia in a software development role, Suprabha decided to try her hand at entrepreneurship. It was 2007. Startups were not as fashionable then as they are today. The venture focused on creating mobile software that could facilitate the operations of e-commerce platforms. Such platforms were then just emerging. But after 18 months, she had to shut it down because she couldn’t get investors willing to bring the product to market.That experience, however, was invaluable. She got insights into the workings of a business, as well as the expectations of clients and investors. She highlighted it in subsequent job interviews. Employers recognised the value of her entrepreneurial background and trusted her ability to lead teams.Suprabha went on to work in engineering and product management roles for Cisco, Nokia, and Intel, before assuming her current role at TransUnion.Throughout her career, Suprabha says, she has learned the significance of customer feedback and approaching product development from a user’s perspective rather than solely from a creator’s point of view. She would constantly keep the business aspect in mind while writing code.In all this, music has been a constant companion. Suprabha can play the piano, and was trained in Carnatic music. “It taught me discipline and the importance of being methodical,” she says. “I tend to write everything down. Everything must be done step by step. This has not only helped get things done, but also in the order of importance. Keeping things in order is also what I expect from my team,” she says. During weekends, Suprabha spends time with her mother humming classical music.She also writes short stories – which also trains the mind to be clear while communicating. Her first attempt was for her niece’s school project. After that, Suprabha started writing stories about things that inspired her during her business trips, and sharing it with family and friends. One such was an incident on an airplane. A young boy was creating a fuss about a broken shoe. Suprabha used this scene to create a story narrating how a shoe feels when it is neglected by people, or how it feels when it is a partner only till a race is won. She titled the story ‘A sole-ful run’.","Suprabha Mysore is vice president of software development at TransUnion. Her brief attempt at entrepreneurship failed.

How they navigated tech careers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/how-they-navigated-tech-careers/articleshow/112001096.cms,"Three senior technologists at

Accenture

’s Advanced Technology Centres (ATC) global network talk about how they have navigated their careers and how technologists should look at a career in technology.

I fought Leukaemia at 24:

Mathangi Sandilya (Global technology lead communications, media and technology)

Listen, unlearn and re-learn:

Shylaja Shivaram (Cloud, software and platforms lead)

I like to say that I was born and raised in data , and grew up in AI. Post a Master’s degree in computer science, I started my career as a software engineer in Mumbai.Soon afterwards, I moved to the US where I worked in technology roles at leading financial services firms. Life gave me a jolt when I was diagnosed with leukaemia at the age of 24. Over the next two years, I fought cancer, regained my strength, and got back to work as soon as I got a good bill of health.A few years later, when I became a mother, I took a four-year long break to raise my two boys. While the transition back to work was not easy, I upskilled myself in cloud computing, data mining, and machine learning and returned to the industry. Over the years, I discovered my passion for data warehousing and data architecture, and even developed a patented data extraction system.After nearly two decades in the US, I moved back to India in 2015 and joined Accenture. I believe adversity is often the best teacher. One must seize the moment and never lose sight of the big picture.I started my career as a software developer post a Bachelor’s degree in maths and a Master’s degree in IT. I have been with Accenture for over two decades, and over the years have gained expertise in customer experience technology implementations, product and platform engineering and more recently in the domains of network and 5G. I hold multiple patents including ones for cell site identification methodologies for 5G and NLP-based sign language generation.The telecom sector plays a crucial role as the technology infrastructure backbone to every other industry, and I love the sheer breadth of exposure my role gives me – the opportunity to work on cuttingedge technology for diverse clients across the world.Building the right foundation skills and learning agility are core to a sustainable career in technology. Expertise in data, AI, and security will remain sought-after even as skills for technologies like the edge become important. Creative problem solving and the ability to build strong teams are just as essential.Although I graduated in industrial engineering, I discovered my aptitude for IT during my first job at a consulting firm. My passion for technology was truly ignited when I joined a bank and independently simplified a legacy treasury application within a few months. The success of this project fueled my enthusiasm for how technology can solve complex business problems. Since then, I have honed my expertise in technology solutions across industries including BFSI, utilities, and life sciences, driving large-scale business transformation projects.I value fresh perspectives, like embracing new ideas, and going beyond the status quo. Meeting new people and new experiences inspire me to think differently, and my philosophy of ‘Listen, Unlearn and ReLearn’ helps me stay relevant.As women, we often underestimate our potential and second-guess ourselves. It’s important to recognise and break this pattern.","Accenture’s Advanced Technology Centres (ATC) global network talk about how they have navigated their careers and how technologists should look at a career in technology.

Dheeraj Pandey says AI has made SaaS 2.0 possible,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/dheeraj-pandey-says-ai-has-made-saas-2-0-possible/articleshow/112001069.cms,"On why Indian SaaS has not taken off the way it was expected

On India’s back-end, front-end talent

In August 2020, Dheeraj Pandey made the surprise announcement that he was quitting the US based company, Nutanix, that he had founded eleven years earlier. Nutanix had pioneered the concept of hyperconverged infrastructure (HCI), using software to converge the disparate elements in an enterprise data centre (server, storage, network) into a single appliance.When Dheeraj – who grew up in Patna, did a computer science degree at IIT Kanpur, and then moved to the US when he was 22 – announced his exit, Nutanix was a $1.6-billion revenue company (its market cap today is over $12 billion).Since that exit, he, together with Manoj Agarwal, who was SVP of engineering at Nutanix, has been building another venture they call DevRev . “Dev is for development, which is proxy for product, and Rev is for revenue, which is proxy for customers,” says Manoj. The existence of any company, he says, depends on just these two things – product and customers. “And our very simple idea was to bring the two together in a way that if you are coming from the product side, you know all the work happening for the product, all the customers consuming that product, all the issues coming from the customer side, all the engagement that customers have, all the revenue coming from the product. And if you come from the customer side, then you can look at all the work that I’m doing for the customers, all of the products they are consuming, the engagement they have,” he says.Dheeraj says such a comprehensive look has been made possible by AI and LLMs . He says software-as-a-service (SaaS) emerged more than two decades ago to simplify the complexity of on-premise software systems. But SaaS itself now has become very complex, he says, with lots of SaaS solutions in an enterprise. “All these SaaS tools, specially CRM tools, were created for each department; there’s a sales CRM, a marketing CRM, a support CRM, a product CRM, and they just don’t talk to each other. It’s tough for customers to integrate them. But with AI now, they can all come together in one knowledge graph . It’s what we call SaaS 2.0 ,” he says.DevRev is building a comprehensive knowledge graph of data across departments, feeding this to an LLM, and which in turn is being fed to a cloud data warehouse for visualisation and analytics. On this foundation, it has built a chatbot, and apps for customer support, product management, software development, and sales automation.“We are able to serve the same solution to the smallest customers, who are not willing to pay much because they have not got funding, and the biggest enterprises. We are built for interactive apps, as also analytical apps, which SaaS 1.0 has not done a good job of at all. And we are built for both a desktop experience, as well as a mobile experience; SaaS 1.0 didn’t do anything about mobile first,” Dheeraj says.In addition to AI and GPT, the new SaaS architecture, he says, has also been made possible because of cloud data warehouses, lots of public cloud services, WebAssembly (which brings amazing power in the browser to run complex (content delivthat are much cheaper than they used to be.The product and platform thinking, which is long-term thinking about programmability, extensibility, customisability, security, reliability, all the itys that the enterprise pays for, is a fairly new concept in India. Without it, you hit a ceiling, you can only sell to SMBs, and maybe the lower end of the mid-market. You can’t do 10-15-20-30 million dollar deals. Enterprises say ₹don't give me a black box, because my business processes are bespoke, and they're complex, and they're my grade, it's not your grade’. And that means they need all those itys, and those are very difficult to get right in a multitenant cloud environment. Multitenancy is the nemesis of all these itys. That is a big architecture piece. And then on top of that, you have to make sure you provide for analytics solutions, which is a big part of enterprise thinking. Now, even customisable LLMs – how do you provide for customisable LLM where you open up the hood, and people can go change the LLM. There’s also the selling side. The enterprise selling motion is very different. First of all, you have to hire a chief revenue officer who's probably 20 years senior to you, you need to inspire these senior people, let them go and hire those reps, those SEs (sales engineers), people who make 700k to a million dollars a year. You have to create a culture where enterprise reps are celebrated. We are hobnobbing with the largest BFSIs right now in India, in our first year of selling, because if we do not understand them now, we'll never understand them.We founded Nutanix in 2009, and set up our India centre four years later. We were late, but back then, the ecosystem here was not that developed. We went on to invest $800 million in our Indian R&D operations. In 2020, when we founded DevRev, we didn’t have to think twice, we came to India on day one.You get these IITians and BITS Pilani folks who are very good at back-end. And then you get the nonIIT folks who focus on the front-end, who are very good at thinking about applications. The two require different kinds of patience, and skills. The backend people are about tinker, tinker, make it better, they continue to polish and finesse, performance, scalability and all that. And the frontend guy, they’re equally patient about little things, the UI, the user experience, the fact that it’s off by one pixel here and one pixel there. The two complement each other. I’d say our Bengaluru centre is more AI, Chennai is more UI, and the new Mumbai centre is a mix of the two.","Dheeraj Pandey, co-founder of DevRev, talks about why Indian SaaS has not taken off the way it was expected.

Indian engineers are helping transform this US retail giant,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/indian-engineers-are-helping-transform-this-us-retail-giant/articleshow/112001018.cms,"Target

’s 4,500-strong India base is now akin to an extended HQ

India’s key role

American retailer Target has close to 2,000 stores across the length and breadth of the US, and this traditionally offline behemoth, which embraced digital ecommerce several years ago, is now leveraging cutting-edge AI technologies to enhance customer experiences, streamline operations, and empower its workforce.At the heart of this technological transformation is a robust global engineering team , with Target’s India operation playing a pivotal role.Brad Thompson, SVP of technology at Target, says the company has deployed hundreds of decision models (predictive AI models) across its value chain, impacting everything from inventory management to personalised marketing. “Good oldfashioned traditional AI still adds substantial value,” Thompson explains, highlighting the multibilliondollar contributions these models have made to Target’s bottom line.One of Target’s most significant AI deployments is in demand forecasting, a critical function for any retailer, and especially one that is the second largest importer of goods in the US. The company’s algorithms predict sales for every item in every location, dictating inventory movement throughout its vast supply chain.The company has also been experimenting with generative AI, developing a portfolio of over 20 use cases. One recent innovation is “Store Companion,” an AI-powered tool available to all store associates. This system, trained on tens of thousands of store process documents, which were painstakingly checked and edited, allows Target’s employees to ask questions in their preferred language, simplifying tasks, and this, the company says, enhances productivity massively.“We’re the first retailer in the US to deploy a generative AI companion tool for all store associates,” Thompson proudly says.Rachel Whitcomb, SVP of technology at Target, says these broader AI initiatives have had a tangible impact to the retail behemoth’s financials.“Many of the generative AI use cases we’ve begun to explore have a baseline business case or value evaluation. Take Store Companion, for example. Initially, the focus was on saving or redirecting team member hours of work to do more impactful tasks, a strong value proposition. But in addition to these operational ef ficiencies, there are also additional layers of value. Improving guest service (offline or online shoppers) not only boosts sales and loyalty, but also resolves issues like incorrect signage or product management quickly, leading to cost savings.”While Target’s US-based teams drive many of these innovations, the company’s engineering hub in India has been instrumental in bringing these technologies to life. Andrea Zimmerman, SVP and president of Target in India, says the 4,500-strong team in India plays a critical role for the company.“What’s special and different about the team in India is that these 4,500 team members span a wide range of capabilities, not just a single area,” Zimmerman says. “We have technologists, data scientists, store designers, architects, a distinguished creative and marketing team, HR, finance, enterprise services, and more. What’s unique about the way we work is how we bring these connected capabilities together to deliver impact for Target in the US.”The India operation, celebrating its 20th year, has evolved into an extended headquarters, working in close collaboration with US-based teams. “We operate as an extended headquarters, not in the traditional sense of a GCC, but as a connected global headquarters. Our teams are working together, solving problems, and impacting our strategy together,” says Zimmerman.Of the total India team, approximately 1,700 are part of the technology organisation. These engineers, data scientists, and analysts work on crucial systems that power Target’s operations.The India team’s engineering work has been instrumental in developing the company’s core retail systems, including the item system a high-volume data system that serves as the product catalog for Target’s entire operation. This system, largely developed in India, manages over three million SKUs (stock keeping units) and is crucial for inventory ordering and online display.The team is also heavily involved in supply chain technologies, particularly in transportation systems that manage global shipments and domestic logistics.","American retailer Target has close to 2,000 stores across the length and breadth of the US.

"‘Internship scheme not compulsory, we are nudging industry to do it’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/internship-scheme-not-compulsory-we-are-nudging-industry-to-do-it/articleshow/112000961.cms,"A day after presenting her seventh straight

, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman sat down with TOI’s Surojit Gupta and Sidhartha to discuss the messages — from politics to reforms and the broader economy. Excerpts:

Your budget is being described as a political budget and is being analysed in light of the election results. Did the original intent of the government, reflected in the interim budget, change after the results?

FM:

What about the focus on jobs?

In hindsight, could the interim budget have included steps that would have helped politically in the elections?

Budget 2024: Big Relief To Indian Taxpayers | Changes In New Regime Slabs | Nirmala Sitharaman

Are other demands from Andhra which were part of the reorganisation bill still on the table?

The demand for special status keeps coming, not just from Bihar and AP, but also from others such as Odisha. Is that something that you would want the Finance Commission to take a relook at?

Your govt has stayed away from freebies but the opposition has been promising them, such as Rs 8,500 monthly transfer to women. Given that everyone wants more, how challenging is it to address their demand and convince them that it’s not good in the long run?

How do you deal with the political consequences of not offering these types of schemes?

. Is it based on facts or is there some misinterpretation?

How will govt respond to it?

There is a lot of attention on capital gains tax and the decision to do away with indexation benefit, while reducing tax. What prompted this change and is the assessment that people will be worse off correct?

You have announced this grand scheme for employment and skilling. But you have invited criticism that govt is interfering with the labour market and will direct the private sector. How do you address these concerns?

How will the matching be done?

Jobs are the big thrust of the budget. The Survey also says 78.5 lakh jobs are required every year. Will the measures ensure that the requirement is met?

How challenging is to deal with the employment challenge in a country where population is growing while there is growing application of AI and greater mechanisation in sectors such as construction?

But fewer people…

Economy is doing well but there are price pressures, especially with monsoon being patchy and there is the challenge of climate change. How do you deal with supply side issues?

India has liberal FDI ceilings. Is there a case for better marketing of India as an investment destination and dealing with some of the other issues like bilateral investment treaties, which some countries want to be simplified? The Survey also mentioned that there are some tax and non-tax concerns.

In the past, govt has tried land reforms and farm sector reforms but faced resistance. Will you still pursue it since economists see them as a structural constraint? Some political parties also seem to agree. Or will you leave it to states?

You have raised the securities transaction tax on F&O and there are concerns about that segment. Are more regulatory steps required? How do you deal with this apprehension of speculation in the market at a time when there are more retail investors coming in?

Are you still going ahead with the public sector policy and what is the privatisation plan?

On small savings rate, the RBI Bulletin has periodically suggested that rates are kept lower than market-linked rates. Is the govt looking at the post-tax return while announcing rates?

In recent weeks, there have been demands to ease visa and investment restrictions from China. Is it feasible, given the continuing tension on the border?

MSMEs are another big focus area and you have addressed financing and technological upgrade -related aspects. What about compliance and inspections?

There are concerns over the provisions in the Income Tax Act on booking expenditure for payments that are overdue beyond 45 days, which is a provided for the in SME Development Act. Does that law need to be dealt with first?

One of the manifesto promises was to extend Aayushman Bharat to senior citizens and the expectation was that it will be done in the budget.

You have sought to rationalise the provisions related to TCS and TDS. There are close to 50 entries and now you are getting a lot of data. Will the review of the income tax law also deal with these issues?

What will be the broad mandate?

You have now presented seven budgets, which has been the most difficult one?

Have you enjoyed it?

One issue that you mentioned yesterday, was the PM’s insistence on fiscal consolidation.

Not many of your predecessors have been in this job for five years. Do you get satisfaction that you have been able to see the results?

Do you get a little disturbed because of the attacks on social media?

This budget has every continuity from the interim budget, nothing has been dropped, everything has continued, though newer things have been added.When you say it is political, you refer to projects we have taken up for Bihar and Andhra Pradesh. But we did that for a reason. The AP Reorganisation Act must be honoured. We have been doing it since 2014. That is why backward districts fund had to be given for backward district development in both Telangana and Andhra; many institutions, AIIMS, IIIT, IIT, have been set up there. In some cases, there has been some delay like Polavaram. Now the first cabinet approval has been honoured; because it is a national project, we will have to give money for it. Similarly, Andhra Pradesh is the only state without a capital, we will give money. These are additions but it is not as if they never existed. They need to be honoured now because 10 years have passed.In Bihar’s case, can anyone deny the devastation that happens because of Kosi flooding? Efforts were made at India’s cost to build dams in Nepal to regulate the flow of the river and stop flooding. The progress on that is still awaited and so we decided to do something to stop people from suffering. Proposal from the Bihar govt is for Kosi-Mechi dam and irrigation and there are 20 other minor projects, which we have accepted. At our cost, we are willing to send a team to assess if barrages can be built to divert water to sort out the problem of floods.■ That’s not political. Job creation has always been our priority and we have come up with a packages of five schemes.■ I am not in a position to assess it because I look at the budget as a statement of what we’re doing. As a vote on account, I was expected to ensure that I took care of expenditure till the time a new govt came in. That’s how we went about it, except the solar rooftop scheme, which is required for renewable energy in the country.■ The 14th Finance Commission and a committee under Raghuram Rajan looked at it and for 10-12 years it has been suggested as a unsustainable categorisation. There’s nothing more that I can add to it.■ It is very challenging. Although many parties realise that it is unsustainable, beyond a point, I don’t think there’s political honesty in accepting it. You may probably justify giving a freebie today. In a public position, who is answerable for taxpayers, you have to be clear that collecting tax from someone and paying it to somebody else, however deserving that person may be, should be sustainable. You should be able to generate adequate revenue to meet primary requirements of a society: drinking water, electricity, primary health and education. You have to be honest in ensuring that you don’t borrow left, right and centre and leave a burden on future generations. Look at what is happening in Karnataka. They must honour the electoral promises without saying they don’t have money for development. You need honest debate on these things.■ You need an honest debate on how far one can go. It is not easy to say that your freebie is unacceptable, while defending my own as a welfare measure. And why should people not take the benefit of something being given for free? Buses in Karnataka are full of women who you don’t want to pay, and I won’t blame them (the women). But when you charge men double for it, eventually it’s the family paying for it.■ This is 100% blatant misinformation. Unsubstantiated claims are being made as political narrative setting tools. Till such a time it is refuted and refuted many number of times, they will go on saying it, making people wonder what is going on. People will like to see the facts but there is a lag before truth reaches them. The opposition, particularly Congress, is brazenly pushing this methodology of building a narrative which is not backed by facts, or backed by partial facts. They hide what has happened during their govts. For instance, if I don’t mention the name of a state in my budget speech, they say the state has got nothing at all. To counter it, I will have to take a budget document, open every page and say, for this state, I’ve done this for that state, I’ve done this. As a responsible opposition, you think you have no other way in which you can put the govt on the mat, except for disinformation? This brazen method of building a false narrative, repeating it and restating it with the hope that it will stick has been tried in the Lok Sabha elections. They are trying it even now.■ I will be countering it it. Every time I stand up to do that, I’m sounding defensive. If they were in power, they would be equally defensive. In the election, people voted for the opposition to be responsible, that’s why after a good struggle, they reached 99, they could not cross 100. But even after that, they don’t seem to get the message. By conducting a misinformation campaign and sounding aggressive, they want to posture that they have been very solid as the opposition. But people will see through it sooner or later. You’re filibustering and will, after a point, be exposed. This perception that you will be at a disadvantage is not real . It’s absolutely not correct. The idea is to simplify the way in which different asset classes are being treated for capital gains tax and treat them similarly. That’s why it has resulted in 10% becoming 12.5% for stocks but getting reduced for others. We have gone through several cases or instances, picking up different numbers for assets, including property, bought in 2001, 2002 or 2003 and seen the taxable amount. After working it out, we have arrived at 12.5%. We have released the calculations, and you can see it. In almost every case, people have a lower tax burden under this system. Small or medium, people who are going into the market or property investments are going to benefit from it. Nobody’s going to be worse off, unless you’re a top, big investor. We are accused of working only for Ambani and Adani and they (the opposition) want to bring wealth tax and inheritance tax. Today, you are shouting at me for asking those few people, who have higher earning, to pay more.■ It’s not compulsory for anybody, we are nudging people to do it. Who is intruding into the private sector? By the way, you always accused us of support ing only two (groups) and not the others. Hypocrisy, thy name is Congress party.■ There is no difficulty on the EPFO side. It is only when we want interns to go for training, we will have to ensure that industries come on board. We will have the labour ministry or ministry of corporate affairs to look into this. It is optional. We’re not forcing anybody, we’ve had a lot of discussion with CII and Ficci and they thought it is possible to do it. It will actually help them because they will have industry-ready people, who can be employed.■ First, Economic Survey does it purely from the point of the economy, it is for businesses, entrepreneurs to create jobs. We have come up with eight specific measures, they will create jobs. Once it gathers momentum, many oth ers will also find interns who come out. L&T recently said they were unable to find 45,000 trained workers. So, jobs are there but we don’t have people who can be employed.■ What you failed to point out is that it can still employ that many more, though more like crane operators and not brick carriers. Today, large construction doesn’t happen in situ, material comes from some place, it is fitted as per plan, often with some computerised perfection. Jobs are still there, but no longer that manual. It is still going to take a lot of manpower, but the skill sets have to be different. You still see hundreds of people when a new Parliament building is being built or the Central Vista is being built.■ That’s right. But look at the quantum of construction — flyovers, highways, roads, ports, inland waterways. You didn’t have these many projects happening earlier when labour was just manual. You are doing 22-25 km of highways every day and everything has been scaled up.■ We will have to wait for the meteorological department to tell us whether it (monsoon) has been in the adequate range. There are several things which are being done for perishables — storage, irradiation. There is a scheme for MSME irradiation as well, which will help perishables last longer and reach the market even when it is not production season. We have announced measures to have vegetable production clusters around major cities. There are several ways in which we are managing food products, particularly perishables. We want to ensure better supply chain linkages.■ On investing in India, people realise that if there is one economy in the world whose macroeconomic fundamentals are strong, it is India. Investment protection agreements are being taken up. We’re talking with a lot of countries to have these agreements done wherever the trade agreements happen. I want to be clear that taxation cannot be part of investment agreements. There are some investment-related treaties, which require taxation-related matters also to become a part of the investment treaties. We are clearly hesitant.It is Parliament which decides how tax matters have to be dealt with. Our taxes cannot be subject to arbitration or court proceedings elsewhere. Putting it into a bilateral investment treaty, and opening up Indian taxes to be adjudicated elsewhere is not right; in fact, impossible. So those are the kinds of things on which we’ll have to negotiate and negotiate for India’s sovereign position to be absolutely intact.■ I don’t know if political parties agree, because they seem to take a politically convenient line rather than support any of these issues. In any case, on that, I won’t be able to say anything further.■ As a regulator, Sebi is very alert. It is working to protect the interest of investors and as the regulator, it will have to keep alerting people about the risks involved. Not everything is speculation, people also want to invest and earn legitimately. Indian regulators have done very well. Our regulators are periodically reinforcing their mechanisms, but they are taking a soft touch approach and are in a consultative mode, before they bring in any regulation, thereby giving good confidence to our investors.■ It is intact and it is approved by Parliament, so we will honour it.■ Progressively a lot of steps have been taken to align our rates with the recommendations of the Shyamala Gopinath committee. So, it is not as if we’re deviating from the committee’s suggestions.■ I’m not sure there’s anything in front of me. There may be some discussions going on in other parts of the govt.■ The finance or MSME ministries cannot deal with everything that affects them. The states in which they are located also have a role to play. However, from our side, we’ve announced major measures and I hope problems of credit, financing, problems of addressing the marketing requirements, problems of purchase of equipment have, to a very large extent, been addressed.■ Yes, whether they want 45 days, which has existed in the law for several years, or 90 days or whatever else, is something which relates to the MSME. All that the MSMEs requested finance ministry to do was let them get the tax benefit. By not paying within the stipulated time you (the buyers) are violating the MSME Act while also claiming the benefit for it (payment that was not made). MSMEs said they (buyers) are not paying them but they’re getting tax benefit out of it.

It’s a good thing that, as a team, all of us work together; the immense support and time that the PM gives is unbelievable. It will not be fair for any minister to expect that kind of support, and he has ungrudgingly given time to talk about budget issues.■ That’s been his hallmark from his Gujarat days, he has never been profligate.■ Budget-making today is so different from what it was earlier. The budget document itself is a lot more transparent and accountable, and that’s not to say that they were not accountable earlier. But the document speaks for itself because everything is on board.■ I think I’ve got used to it although I do take some messages seriously because they can be from people who have genuinely been affected and they are voicing it through social media. May be that’s one way they are trying to reach out to govt, to the finance minister, to the Prime Minister. I do take some of the messages like an SOS. But some of the messages are very vicious: in the language that they use and the tone with which they say. But it’s not possible for me to allow that to upset me.

‘We need a graded approach to include petro products under GST’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/we-need-a-graded-approach-to-include-petro-products-under-gst/articleshow/112000328.cms,"CBIC

chairman Sanjay Kumar Agarwal says protection of

industry

by raising

duties

is not permanent. He also discusses

rate rationalisation. Excerpts from an interview with Sidhartha & Surojit Gupta

FM has spoken about fewer customs slabs, if you could use that word. Can you help us understand how it will be structured?

There has been criticism about India raising import duties in the last few years but what you said suggests that several of these increases are probably temporary to get manufacturing to India and, once the ecosystem is there, a review of the duty is possible. Is that a fair assessment?

So protection is not permanent?

How much did the menace of gold smuggling impact in reducing duty or was it due to the fact that the domestic gems and jewellery industry was getting affected due to high tariffs?

The Budget talks about rationalisation of GST rates and inclusion of more products, which we think is a reference to

petroleum products

. What is your view on this issue of rationalisation? Is it time to include petroleum?

We routinely undertake an exercise of the conditional notification.And within two years, we have to take that exercise, and in case we find that exemption need not be continued, we allow that exemption to lapse. In certain cases, this condition is waived, depending on the type of exemption that has been given. The idea is that we want to reduce the number of customs duty rates. In this Budget also, we are seeking to give impetus to domestic manufacturing and, in certain cases, we want to strengthen the supply chains, and help its diversification. We wanted to give certain duty concessions to industries which are in exports. And in some cases where there is an onslaught of cheap imports, such cases have been considered... and likewise where there is duty inversion, those cases also have been addressed. So, if I give a specific example, that in the case of critical minerals 25 in numbers, there is no mining of such minerals in India and the entire demand is met from imports. So, there were varying rates of duty 2.5% or 7.5%, where the exemption has been provided so that these minerals are imported and processed in the country. And for further use in various sectors, maybe it can be electronics, telecommunication or in renewable energy devices or in defence of the space sector.Precisely that is the objective. If we retain the high level of protection, industry becomes uncompetitive, and in future industry has to remain competitive in international markets, because although we have a huge domestic demand, but we will have to be an export-led economy and that will be possible only if industry is very competitive. First, we will have to ensure that industry takes strong roots in the country and then slowly we have to reduce duty so they remain competitive, they don’t become complacent, and then only they can compete with others in the world market.Consumer interest is paramount, protection is not permanent. But initially some kind of protection is required so that industry can be established in the country.It is both because the gems and jewellery sector was persistently asking for reduction in duty on gold because that is the basic raw material. And yes, if the rate of duty is high on gold, the margin between the price differential, price arbitrage is again huge, huge between the international market and domestic market.Now seven years have passed, it has now stabilised and that is reflected in the growth of revenue from GST. Now, the time has come that we look into simplification of the rate structure. There may be a need for rationalisation of rates and bringing down the number of rates, number of slabs. You talked about petroleum items, there are five petroleum items which are outside GST. These are crude oil, natural gas, petrol, diesel and ATF. Petrol and diesel are fuels for automotive purposes but crude oil is a feedstock for further manufacturing. Natural gas is also used by industry, along with its use in CNG and as a cooking fuel. We can see that there can be two categories of these items: Crude is not used by end consumers and it goes into industrial use. It has to be gradual but not in one gap. There can be a graded approach which is possible","CBIC chairman Sanjay Kumar Agarwal says protection of industry is not permanent.

‘Internship beneficiaries will be picked in a fair and transparent way',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/internship-beneficiaries-will-be-picked-in-a-fair-and-transparent-way/articleshow/112000433.cms,"Finance secretary TV Somanathan says there will be

objective criteria

to decide candidates selected for the internship scheme. He argues that some of the

incentives for employment

will pull down entry barriers for first-timers

How is the

employment scheme

going to be implemented?

How will education loan subsidy work?

We are four months into the fiscal year, and you have stuck to the capex target for the year. Do you see more demand coming?

You have had talks with employees on the shape of NPS they would like. What is the feedback and when are you going to give your recommendations?

As with most budgets, there’s the complaint that there is nothing for the middle class. How would you respond to that?

There are three direct incentives for employment, two for skilling. In the first three, there are three parts.One is an incentive which will be paid to every first timer who enters the formal job market. If we receive the CV of somebody with no experience, versus the CV of somebody with experience, the person with experience is preferred. There is a cost to the employer in absorbing a first timer into the organization because that person has to go through the learning curve. By providing a subsidy to the employee, we are encouraging the employer to recruit. The second scheme is also for first timers, but if an employer adds either 50 employees or 25% of the previous year first timers, we are offering a very substantial subsidy over a period of four years, which will be 72% of one a month’s salary. The idea is to again incentivise employment of those who are not able to get employment on their own in the present setup. The third one doesn’t distinguish between first-timers and others, there is an incentive for any employer who creates incremental employment above the baseline and sustains it. Selection for the internship scheme will be done from a list and not in a way that no one gets employment through the backdoor. It’s not that this is a way for a company to take in people it would have placed anyway or recruited anyway and claim subsidy. The list will come from govt from which they will choose. The entire process will be done in an objective manner through a portal and based on open access. Those with lower employability will be chosen and we have a negative list of IITs, IIMs, CAs; any person whose family member with assessed income will be excluded. Govt will soon decide the criteria for selection.This scheme will be administered by the ministry concerned. Students will apply to the bank, like they do, for getting student loans. In that we open an additional window for those who are in this scheme, but they must be ineligible for benefits under any other govt scheme.I wish to emphasize that the Budget is a continuation of the interim budget that was presented for this year. In Feb, we thought that this level of capex will be appropriate, and we are maintaining that level. I don’t know if we will be able to spend the whole thing or there will be acceleration. It is an aspirational target to reach Rs 11,11,111 crore.I can’t comment on the timing. From the staff side the core issue is that they do not want their pension to be at the mercy of fluctuating market forces or market valuations. The second core issue is there should be an element of dearness allowance because there will be inflation, and the real value of the pension must be protected. Then, there is a third one, which is that for those who may not have full service, there must be some kind of base minimum level of pension.Our statistics show that nearly 70% of taxpayers are on the new tax regime and there are substantial concessions for them due to the standard deduction and change in slabs. The incentives given on the employment side, salaries up to Rs 1 lakh is covered and not only for lower pay levels. It will also push employment of middleclass youth. There is subsidy on education loans and several other initiatives including more credit flow to MSME entrepreneurs. They are all in the middle class.","There are three direct incentives for employment, two for skilling.

Sanjay Malhotra says that the govt has not estimated any revenue gain from changes in

capital gains tax

on

real estate

. In an interview to TOI, Malhotra says people are not looking at the reduction in

tax rate

from 20% to 12.5%

There are apprehensions about the changes to capital gains tax, particularly from the real estate point of view as

indexation

What would have been the average?

There is apprehension that it is some kind of a backdoor entry of wealth tax…

Is there any estimate of the revenue that you will get from this measure?

FM has promised a comprehensive review of the income tax law. There was a report earlier too so how will you proceed?

There are complaints that the income tax portal is slow. What are your views?

So any possibility of extending the last date for filing returns?

Why did the govt decide against extending the benefit of lower tax for new manufacturing units?

has been scrapped.Could you explain the impact on taxpayers?This exercise should be seen as a rationalisation exercise. It’s a simplification exercise. Govt has always endeavoured towards a simple tax regime, one that is easy to comprehend and easy to implement. In line with this vision, govt introduced GST. It was a monumental reform. Similarly, even on the income tax side, you have seen a number of measures for simplification that have been announced while some are in the pipeline, including the comprehensive review of income tax. Now, this is only one small measure relative to capital gains. Most people will gain from the removal of indexation. Firstly, unlisted companies stand to hugely gain from this 20% with indexation because their returns every year is generally more than 13%- 14%- 5%. They have widely welcomed this move for removal of indexation. My strong belief is that even in real estate, a vast majority will actually benefit. What people are really looking at is that indexation has been removed, not at the reduction in the tax rate from 20% to 12.5%.My understanding is that the average would be much more than 12.5%.Not at all. This is a canard being spread by some people. There is no inheritance tax. If you reinvest this money in buying another house, your wealth remains and there is no tax on it. But if you sell it generate cash, then that becomes taxable, as is the case with shares. If you reinvest the proceeds from the shares, or the capital gains part, again into shares, there is no such benefit; or even for equity mutual funds. So, to say this is a tax on wealth or inheritance is totally false and baseless.From real estate we have estimated nil. Our estimate is that it is nil, revenue it may even be negative.That exercise was completed and many of its provisions have been incorporated. The purpose is to really make it more simple, lucid, as the FM announced. People should be able to read and understand it easily. It will be a complete review and wherever we need rewriting we will do it. We will take into account whatever work has been done. An internal committee of officers undertake the review and also consult stakeholders.These are implementation issues. The Microsoft servers were down. So these are technology issues. We are monitoring it for the last few days. It’s been very, very smooth. We’ve got about 22 lakh returns on Tuesday. The peak filing is 50 lakh. We are monitoring the performance of the portal and we will do whatever is necessary.No, not at all. That is not on the cards. We are very confident that we will be able to smoothly accept all returns by July 31.Our tax rates are very reasonable, it works out of around 25%. We are confident that these rates will help attract good investment. We have taken a number of measures in the budget to further spur investment – angel tax has been removed, tax on foreign companies have been lowered. There have been changes on the indirect taxes side to help manufacturing.","Malhotra says people are not looking at the reduction in the tax rate from 20% to 12.5%.

food inflation

and billionaire tax. In an interview to TOI, Seth is upbeat about sticking to the fiscal consolidation plan against the backdrop of global uncertainities

How do you see the fiscal consolidation play pan out given the uncertainties?

High food inflation has been an issue. There have been suggestions to keep food inflation separate from the point of view of

monetary policy

. What is your view?

Does the Budget create conditions for

interest rates

to ease?

High food prices and high vegetable prices are recurring issues due to weather related events. What is the strategy to tackle this?

Brazil has put a proposal for a tax on billionaires at the G20. What is your view?

The economy did better last year, and is estimated to continue to do equally well this year.That means we don’t see any downside in revenues. However, there can be some upside. The new expenditure is of the order of Rs 50-60 thousand crore, including for the new schemes, and the RBI dividend has been more than what we had estimated. Keeping all that in mind, it was felt that we can go down to 4.9%. This should put less pressure on the market, more money for the private sector. We can say with reasonable confidence that 4.9% is an achievable aspiration. Budget is an important document of fiscal policy. Fiscal policy and monetary policy has to be in synergy with each other but the question that you are asking is purely monetary policy remit so I would not like to jump into that question. Except saying there have been decisions, various monetary economists have been talking about what is the right anchor for inflation for monetary policy. Organisations like the IMF have been talking about it. What the Budget takes into account that over the course of the next 12 months what is the outlook on inflation?Monetary policy takes several things into consideration. What is the fiscal stance of govt is also one of the factors. So I will park that issue there. This Budget makes it very clear what kind of consolidation we have to do and having the ability and retaining the ability to meet all priority expenditure.I would like to draw your attention to para 13 and para 14 of the Budget speech which point to where govt wants more action. Is overall food inflation at a particular level, headline a little more. The Budget says the pulses mission and the oilseeds mission need to be stepped up. These are not new programmes but we have to do better than what we have been doing. It has already identified a very clear action because the only solution to that can be by becoming self-sufficient which means more production in those areas. We can’t be importing, then we are dependent on others . On vegetables, seasonal variation sets in. How the climate will behave next year we don’t know. But what is in our control, can vegetables be grown closer to large consumption centres rather than saying they will be grown in one part of the country and transported over hundreds of kilometres. These are perishable commodities, and logistics costs are involved. These are the supply side measures of addressing the issue.We have tried in the past taxing wealth and not succeeded. Purely from an economic perspective,it doesn’t make sense to tax that. This discourse that tax wealth is a bad concept.","Ajay Seth, economic affairs secretary, talks about a range of issues from fiscal consolidation to managing high food inflation and billionaire tax.

NEW DELHI: Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman in a move to bolster the Indian start-up ecosystem and to support innovation in the country proposed the abolishment of the ' Angel Tax ' for all classes of investors .""Govt abolishes Angel tax for all classes of investors in startups ,"" the finance minister said.In the interim budget announced in February, The government had put forth a proposal to extend tax incentives for startups and investments facilitated by sovereign wealth or pension funds for an additional year, effective until March 2025.Also See: Budget 2024 Live Updates The ""Angel Tax"" refers to a levy imposed on the capital raised by unlisted companies via the issue of shares to investors. This tax targets the premium paid by investors above the fair market value of shares, often classified as ""income from other sources"" and taxed accordingly.The Finance Act of 2012 brought about a significant change in the Income Tax Act by introducing Section 56(2)(viib). This section specifically targeted investments received by unlisted Indian companies. Under this provision, any investment that is valued above the fair market value is treated as income and subjected to taxation.Implemented in India in 2012, the Angel Tax aims to curb money laundering and prevent the inflow of unaccounted money. However, it has sparked controversy among startups and investors, who argue it stifles innovation and fundraising. To address these concerns, the government has introduced several exemptions and relief measures for eligible startups, easing the tax burden and fostering a more conducive environment for entrepreneurial growth.","The ""Angel Tax"" refers to a levy imposed on the capital raised by unlisted companies via the issue of shares to investors.

The company is accused of unfair practices, misuse of market dominance, unauthorized sharing of Nigerians' personal information, and denying Nigerians the ability to control how their data is utilized.

Using SIMBARA, the government would be able to track the nickel and tin from mines to domestic smelters .""Smelting companies have to register where they buy the nickel from and where the mines are,"" Septian Hario Seto, deputy coordinating minister for maritime and investment affairs, said in an interview.Smelters will not be allowed to unload ore shipments from mines that have not yet paid their royalties. The system successfully increased government revenue in the coal sector, Seto told Reuters, and hoped to see similar improvement in the nickel and tin sectors.The SIMBARA system will also be linked to the government's digital records of mining quotas , known as RKAB. It enables miners to track how much production quota a miner has left for the period and to alert authorities should there be discrepancies in output and sales data, he added.A senior official has said Jakarta will implement the system on other minerals such as bauxite and copper, but the timing would be decided later on, once the nickel and tin tracking system has run smoothly.","Indonesia is the world's biggest producer of nickel and one of its largest producers of tin.

TAIPEI: Taiwan's TSMC , the world's largest contract chipmaker, raised its full-year revenue forecast on Thursday given surging demand for chips used in artificial intelligence, and rejected the idea of a joint venture factory in the United States.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC), a major Apple Inc and Nvidia supplier, has benefited from the global AI boom that has helped it weather the tapering off of pandemic-led electronics demand.The bellwether for the chip industry earlier on Thursday posted net profit that beat market expectations.

Wei told analysts and reporters at an earnings conference.The company's U.S.-listed shares rose 3.3% in pre-market trading following the results.Its Taiwan-listed shares, however, closed down 2.4% before the earnings announcement, extending falls this week after U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said that Taiwan ""did take about 100% of our chip business"" and should pay the U.S. for its defence.TSMC is spending $65 billion on three plants in the U.S. state of Arizona and has other new factories in operation or planning stages in Japan and Germany, which have partner investors.Asked if TSMC would consider a joint venture in the United States following Trump's comments, Wei said no.""So far we did not change any of our original plans of expansion of our overseas fabs. We continue to expand in Arizona, in Kumamoto, and maybe in future in Europe. No change in our strategy. We continue in our current practice,"" he added.On whether TSMC has enough capacity to support the demand for chips, he said things were ""very, very tight"".""We are working very, very hard to get enough capacity to support my customers from now all the way to next year, to 2026.""CFO Wendell Huang said supply for leading edge nodes, including its 3nm and 5nm, would remain very tight next year.For the current quarter, TSMC said its revenue would increase by as much as 34%, in a range of between $22.4 billion to $23.2 billion.The company adjusted its capital expenditure plans for this year to between $30 billion and $32 billion, compared with a previous forecast of $28 billion to $32 billion.TSMC's April-June net profit climbed to T$247.8 billion ($7.60 billion) from T$181.8 billion a year earlier.The profit beat a T$238.8 billion estimate for the quarter ended June 30, according to an LSEG SmartEstimate drawn from 21 analysts. SmartEstimates give greater weighting to forecasts from analysts who are more consistently accurate.""Moving into the third quarter of 2024, we expect our business to be supported by strong smartphone and AI-related demand for our leading-edge process technologies,"" Huang said.Second-quarter revenue at TSMC, Asia's most valuable publicly listed company, rose by 33% to $20.8 billion, better than the company's previous forecast of $19.6 billion to $20.4 billion.",Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) has benefited from the global AI boom.
