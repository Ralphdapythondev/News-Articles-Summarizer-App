Insolvency Proceedings: Subhash Chandra Faces Insolvency Proceedings,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/subhash-chandra-faces-insolvency-proceedings/articleshow/109512434.cms,"NEW DELHI: The National Company Law Tribunal ( NCLT ) on Monday admitted a petition filed by Indiabulls Housing Finance and directed initiation of personal insolvency proceedings against Subhash Chandra , the founder-chairman emeritus of Zee Entertainment Enterprises.Chandra had given a personal guarantee of around Rs 170 crore to a group entity Vivek Infracon and Indiabulls Housing Finance had moved NCLT for a default that took place in 2022.Chandra had challenged the move, arguing NCLT did not have powers.Following discussion around a settlement, the case was withdrawn from the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT). Subsequently, the terms of the agreement were allegedly not met, resulting in Indiabulls Housing Finance approaching the tribunal (NCLT) once again for action under section 95 of the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code (IBC). The move also followed last year’s Supreme Court ruling, which upheld the validity of provisions related to personal insolvency in IBC.The apex court ruling has opened the floodgates for creditors to initiate action against a host of corporate chiefs even in cases where they have not been able to recover the full amount in corporate insolvency cases. On Monday, NCLT pronounced the order, but a detailed judgment is awaited. It, however, rejected pleas filed by two other creditors, IDBI Trusteeship and Axis Bank.“The copy of the order is awaited. Appropriate steps will be actioned in accordance with the applicable law,” says a statement from office of Chandra. Chandra can appeal against the order in the appellate tribunal (NCLAT).Unlike a corporate insolvency resolution process, where the promoters are ousted and a resolution professional takes charge, along with a committee of creditors, personal insolvency proceedings work differently. As a first step, NCLT will appoint a resolution professional.Once an application is admitted, there is a moratorium, when every legal action or proceeding pending in respect of any debt owed by the personal guarantor is deemed to have been stayed. Once claims are received from creditors, the personal guarantor prepares a repayment plan, along with the resolution professional, which may involve restructuring of loans or transfer or sale of some assets. So far, progress on personal insolvency cases has been slow.","Chandra had given a personal guarantee of around Rs 170 crore to a group entity Vivek Infracon.

"No more OTP frauds? Home Ministry teams up with SBI Cards, telecom operators for innovative solution on stolen one-time passwords",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/no-more-otp-frauds-home-ministry-teams-up-with-sbi-cards-telecom-operators-for-innovative-solution-on-stolen-one-time-passwords/articleshow/109524380.cms,"Crooks on the prowl

No more OTP frauds? India's home ministry, SBI Cards and Payment Services Ltd (SBI Card), and telecom operators are collaborating to create a solution that will alert customers about stolen one-time passwords (OTPs) as part of a larger initiative to address the increasing risk of cyber fraud and phishing attacks on the banking system.According to two individuals familiar with the matter, the government is evaluating a solution that will enable banks to monitor a customer's registered address and the geolocation where an OTP is being delivered.If there is a discrepancy between the two locations, the customer can be notified of a potential phishing attempt, said an ET report. The solution is currently in the testing phase, and the goal is to use the telecom database to track the customer's geolocation and ensure that the OTP is being sent to the correct location.The Reserve Bank of India had advocated for an additional factor of authentication for any digital payment transaction primarily to prevent fraud. However, over time, fraudsters have developed sophisticated capabilities to either steal OTPs by deceiving unsuspecting bank customers or redirect OTPs to their own devices through fraudulent means, rendering the second factor of authentication ineffective in combating cybercrime.If there is a problem with the OTP delivery location, two steps can be taken: either an alert can be displayed on the device, or the OTP can be blocked entirely. While the specifics of the solution are still being developed with telecom companies, a customer's SIM location can be verified in real-time and compared to the geolocation of OTP delivery. Banks also have their own data on customers' residences, so capabilities will need to be developed to triangulate the data in real-time.Also Read | Getting wrong calls from loan recovery agents, unable to link number with bank account? You may have got a recycled mobile number “For instance, the customer lives in Bengaluru and the OTP is getting delivered in some place in Uttar Pradesh where the person has never been or from where the person has not made any calls recently, which means he or she is not traveling to that place; this is a typical red flag scenario,” a banker said.According to the Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (i4C), cyber criminals siphoned off as much as Rs 10,319 crore between April 2021 and December 2023. The majority of the crimes originated in China, Cambodia, and Myanmar and involved non-state actors. Under i4C, the government established the 'Citizen Financial Cyber Fraud Reporting and Management System', which has prevented approximately Rs 1,200 crore in fraudulent transfers from more than 470,000 citizen complaints received until February 2024. In the calendar year 2023, the registry received 1.12 million complaints totaling Rs 7,488 crore in fraudulent transfers.","India's home ministry, SBI Cards and Payment Services Ltd (SBI Card), and telecom operators are collaborating to create a solution that will alert customers about stolen one-time passwords.

Deductions that can be claimed under old tax regime

New Tax Regime Vs Old Tax Regime: Selecting the most tax-efficient income tax regime, either the old or new, can be a challenging decision for many salaried taxpayers. The optimal choice depends on the amount of deductions from gross total income that can be claimed to reduce the taxable income. If the gross total income and the minimum amount of deductions at which the tax liability would be the same under both the new tax regime and the old tax regime were known, the decision would be straightforward.When deductions exceed this minimum threshold, the old tax regime would be more advantageous, while the new tax regime would result in lower taxes if the deductions fall below this level.When determining the tax regime for TDS on salary, taxpayers typically use estimated figures for gross total income and proposed deductions. However, once the financial year concludes and the final income and deduction figures are available, precise calculations must be performed before selecting an income tax regime while filing the income tax return. Taxpayers can change the tax regime chosen by them earlier at the time of filing income tax return, provided they file within the deadline. Also, one very important point to note is that the new income tax regime is now the default tax regime, so if you don’t tell your employer your preferred regime, the tax will be deducted as per the new tax regime.The income tax laws under the new tax regime underwent revisions effective from April 1, 2023, and remain unchanged for the current FY, 2024-25 (April 1, 2024-March 31, 2025). The new tax regime offers a basic income exemption limit of Rs 3 lakh for all taxpayers and introduces additional income tax slabs with reduced tax rates.Also Read | Old vs New Income Tax Regime for TDS on salary: Will post-election Budget 2024 impact your choice? Under the new tax regime, salaried individuals are entitled to two deductions: a standard deduction of Rs 50,000 from their salary or pension income, and an employer's contribution to their NPS account, which can be up to 10% of their salary (or 14% of the basic salary for government employees), states an ET report.When comparing the tax regimes, it's crucial to note that the minimum deductions required to equalize the tax outgo in both regimes vary depending on the income level. Individuals with different gross taxable incomes, such as Rs 8 lakh and Rs 12 lakh, will need to claim different total deductions in the old tax regime to make the tax payable equal in both regimes. If an individual's actual total deduction in the old tax regime falls below this break-even level, the new tax regime becomes more advantageous.To illustrate this point, ET considers the example of two individuals, A and B, with gross taxable incomes of Rs 8 lakh and Rs 12 lakh, respectively. Both can claim a deduction of Rs 2.5 lakh in a financial year, which includes a standard deduction of Rs 50,000.The above table shows that for Mr A with gross taxable income of Rs 8 lakh, the final tax amount payable is lower in the old tax regime if the total deduction of Rs 2.5 lakh is claimed.However, despite the same deduction amount, Mr B with a gross taxable income of Rs 12 lakh will find the tax outgo lower in the new tax regime. The old tax regime will be favourable for a person with taxable income of Rs 12 lakh only if more deductions are claimed.Under the old tax regime, individuals can avail various deductions from their gross total income and claim tax exemptions. Both salaried and non-salaried individuals can claim deductions of up to Rs 1.5 lakh under Section 80C by making specified investments and expenditures. These include investing in Employees' Provident Fund (EPF), Public Provident Fund (PPF), ELSS mutual fund, repayment of principal of home loan and payment of children's tuition fees.Also Read | New versus Old regime: Does opting for the old income tax regime for TDS on salary make ITR processing, refunds easier? In addition to Section 80C, individuals can claim an extra deduction of Rs 50,000 for investments made in the National Pension System (NPS) according to specified rules, bringing the total deduction to Rs 2 lakh. Deductions can also be claimed for health insurance premium payments, with the amount varying based on the individual's age and whether the policy covers their parents.Furthermore, individuals can claim a deduction of Rs 2 lakh for interest paid on a home loan during the financial year, while interest paid on an education loan is eligible for deduction under Section 80E without any monetary limit. Savings account interest is eligible for deduction under Section 80TTA, and senior citizens can claim a deduction of Rs 50,000 under Section 80TTB for interest earned from various deposits, including savings accounts and fixed deposits.","The income tax laws under the new tax regime underwent revisions effective from April 1, 2023. salaried individuals are entitled to two deductions: a standard deduction of Rs 50,000 from their salary or pension income, and an employer's contribution to their NPS account, which can be up to 10% of their salary.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109474362,imgsize-22570,width-400,resizemode-4/109474362.jpg"
"Now, airlines to ensure kids below 12 are seated with at least one parent or guardian without extra charge",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/now-airlines-to-ensure-kids-below-12-are-seated-with-at-least-one-parent-or-guardian-without-extra-charge/articleshow/109522491.cms,"NEW DELHI: Airlines will now have to ensure that young children are seated with at least one of their parents or guardians on flights without being required to pay extra for seat selection charge if travelling on the same PNR (booking reference). Following numerous complaints from passengers travelling in groups about being seated separately — especially from their children — if they choose not to pay extra for seat selection, the DGCA on Tuesday issued a directive to airlines on this issue.“Airlines shall ensure that children upto the age of 12 years are allocated seats with at least one of their parents/guardians, who are travelling on the same PNR and a record of the same shall be maintained,” says an amended rule by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA).The regulator’s Air Transport Circular (ATC)-01 of 2024 titled “unbundle of services and fees by scheduled airlines” allows airlines to charge extra for services like zero baggage, preferential seating , meals, snacks, beverages, and carriage of musical instruments. On an opt-in basis, passengers can choose to pay for these extra services if they desire to do so.“Such unbundled services are provided on ‘opt-in’ basis by airlines and are not mandatory. There is also a provision for auto seat assignment to passengers who have not selected any seat for web check-in before scheduled departure. In view of the various instances that came to the notice of DGCA wherein children below the age of 12 years were not seated along with their parent/guardian, the existing Air Transport Circular 01 of 2021 has been suitably modified,” a senior official said.The issue of people travelling in groups being seated separately if they do not pay extra for seat selection has been irking travellers across the world and not just in India. The US, for instance, has been grappling with this issue.US President Joe Biden had on Feb 5, 2023, said on X (former Twitter): “Some airlines charge extra to pick your seat, including for parents who want to sit next to their child on a plane. Congress should pass the Junk Fee Protection Act so we can crack down on these fees and give hard-working Americans just a little bit more breathing room.” Then on March 1, 2023, US department of transport secretary tweeted: “Next week,(the department) will publish afamily seating dashboard to show which airlines guarantee families can sit together for free. I appreciate American Airlines becoming the first US airline to commit to putting this guarantee in its customer service plan.” In response, President Biden Tweeted: “I called for airlines to eliminate family seating fees in my State of the Union – and today, American Air announced they're doing just that. No one should have to pay extra to be seated with their kids. Time for more airlines to follow suit.”Airlines globally, including in India, offer pre-seat selection for a charge and those who do not wish to pay this get allocated whatever seats were not pre-booked. As a result, groups or families travelling together are mostly seated separately on flights if they do not book their seats in advance by paying extra.",Airlines will now have to ensure that young children are seated with at least one of their parents or guardians on flights without being required to pay extra for seat selection charge if travelling on the same PNR. The issue of people travelling in groups being seated separately has been irking travellers across the world and not just in India.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109522558,imgsize-1398465,width-400,resizemode-4/109522558.jpg"

Concerns on debt and capex



Reliance Industries share price today: Reliance Industries ( RIL ), led by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, on Monday announced its quarterly earnings for the January to March period. After the release of these results, several brokerages have raised their target prices for the company's stock.As per an ET report by Nikhil Agarwal, the boost in target prices was influenced by positive remarks from RIL's management regarding moderation of capital expenditures ( capex ) and the possibility of increased telecom tariffs .The question now is: Is it time to buy RIL shares?RIL's stock has seen a 14% increase this calendar year, but was trading flat on Tuesday morning after the earnings release. However, brokerages are showing optimism, with several increasing their target prices to up to Rs 3,500.The global brokerage firm Jefferies has raised its target price for Reliance Industries (RIL) from Rs 3,140 to Rs 3,380, expecting a 14% EBITDA growth in FY25, largely driven by Jio's expected tariff hike.UBS has set a target price of Rs 3,420 for RIL, suggesting that retail business sales will grow in the near term due to increased sales per square foot from new stores opened in the last two years.Macquarie has kept a neutral outlook on RIL but has raised its target price from Rs 2,560 to Rs 2,630. Morgan Stanley, meanwhile, has maintained a positive outlook with a target price of Rs 3,046.Bank of America (BoFA) has a target price of Rs 3,250, while Bernstein's target price is Rs 3,160.Domestic brokerage Nuvama has set the highest target price for Reliance Industries (RIL) at Rs 3,500. They believe that RIL's new energy projects will drive the company's next phase of growth while supporting its traditional businesses. Reliance Retail 's year-on-year growth was only 11%, the slowest in three years, mainly due to store restructuring and a higher baseline.According to Equirus Securities, the ongoing decline in discretionary spending worsened the situation. However, Reliance Industries maintained a solid operating margin of 7.4% in the recent quarter. Although they expect this weakness to continue in the near term, Reliance Retail has significant potential in the Indian market. Equirus predicts that the company will achieve a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13% in revenue and 16% in EBITDA between FY24 and FY27.Analysts believe that worries about Reliance Industries' debt are exaggerated, as they expect the company's net debt to decrease gradually. This is because capital expenditures (capex) are set to moderate, and the funding for capex will come from an increase in internal cash generation.","Reliance Industries ( RIL ), led by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, on Monday announced its quarterly earnings for the January to March period.

The finance minister set the stage for a ""Viksit Bharat by 2047"", on the core principles of ‘Sabka Saath’, ‘Sabka Vikas’, ‘Sabka Vishwas’, with ‘Sabka Prayas’ being added as a new theme in the interim Budget.This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data i.e., farmer welfare and N for Nari utthan i.e., support for women entrepreneurs.These form the pillars of a comprehensive inclusive development. The Government's commitment to sustainable development under the strategy for Amrit Kaal includes achieving 'Net Zero' by 2070, rooftop solarization for one crore households and robust health initiatives.The Indian economy's resilience takes center stage amidst positive indicators of declining current account deficit as a percentage of GDP, falling unemployment rates, and a notable rise in digital transactions. These statistics affirm the robustness of the economy, showcasing a trajectory of growth and stability.The achievements in taxation reforms are nothing short of remarkable, with direct tax collections more than trebling in the last decade, the number of tax return filers increasing by 2.4 times, average processing time of tax returns plummeting from 93 days in FY 2013-14 to an impressive 10 days in FY 2023-24, resulting in issuance of quick refunds. These are the results of consistent progressive measures thus obviating the need for, and rightly avoiding, any last-minute populist measures.No change in existing tax rates, both for direct and indirect taxes, is a good indicator of stability and predictability for investors and taxpayers.A welcome move to waive outstanding tax demands that are minor, disputed, and unreconciled. This involves the withdrawal of outstanding direct tax demands up to Rs. 25,000 pertaining to the period up to FY 2009-10 and up to Rs.10,000 for FY 2010-11 to 2014-15.The Government's commitment to fostering a business-friendly environment is evident in its intent to extend specific tax benefits for start-ups, investments by sovereign wealth funds/ pension funds, and certain IFSC units. The extension has been made now until March 31, 2025. This might help in creating a conducive landscape for business.To align with the CBDT notification issued earlier, the provisions relating to tax collection at source concerning remittances under the Liberalized Remittance Scheme have now been formally incorporated in the Finance Bill, 2024, setting the rate at 20% for amounts exceeding Rs. 7 lakhs in a financial year.The Finance Bill, 2024 proposes an extension of the time limit for introducing the faceless scheme by the Central Government for transfer pricing proceedings, DRP Proceedings, and ITAT Proceedings, up to March 31, 2025.The interim Budget 2024 may not have proposed significant tax announcements, but it very well positioned the prelude to the full budget post the upcoming elections. Considering the potential impact on the population across the four pillars of GYAN, a sizable portion of India stands to be covered. The interim Budget’s focus on the tax front resembles a report card, highlighting the maturity achieved by our tax system. The enhancement of taxpayer services was emphasized as a key priority.","This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data and N for Nari utthan.

Interim Budget for a Viksit Bharat: It’s for everyone and all,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/interim-budget-for-a-viksit-bharat-its-for-everyone-and-all/articleshow/107497439.cms,"By Akhilesh Tuteja

The Finance Minister on February 01, 2024, delivered a truly innovative interim budget. At first glance, it did not seem like an interim budget but looked more like the budget to drive further growth and a continuum of inclusive growth-oriented investments.At the outset, this budget brings a wonderful balance between fiscal prudence and continued investment for growth.It's not easy to continue the glide path of reducing the fiscal deficit and continuing to make significant investments in all areas including infrastructure, R&D, energy transition, technology, skilling, and social welfare. The surprising reduction in fiscal deficit of 5.8% as against the budgeted 5.9% for FY24 and the projection of 5.1% in FY25 with a clear focus on increasing investments was a huge positive.This was a budget for everyone and all because it caters to every part of the Indian economy and society. The FM has carefully catered to the investment needs of various sectors. The continued focus on youth, impoverished, women and farmers to increase their involvement and contribution to economic growth is evident. By committing an 11.1% increase in capital expenditure to 11,11,111 lakh crore, the FM has clearly brought every single 1 in this growth journey.What was very impressive was the inclusion strategy of the government. The focus on women's empowerment for the past few years is unprecedented, which is reflected in the inclusion of women in the workforce moving from 23.3% to 37% in the last five years. The thirty crore Mudra Yojna loans to women entrepreneurs were a great boost to the Nari Shakti initiative. We already have over 10 million Lakhpati Didis and what is truly evident is like a corporate CFO, the FM has revised the earlier target of 20 million Lakhpati Didis to 30 million. The government also plans to invest in initiatives to encourage young girls between the ages of 9 and 14 to undertake the vaccination for cervical cancer which is again a great boost to Nari Shakti.A lot needs to be done to bring more women into all parts of economic growth but the journey so far and the vision of the future is truly inspiring.While India continues on its technological prowess and makes its mark in new technologies like Artificial Intelligence, we need a multi-pronged strategy to harness the power of AI. We need a clear focus on building AI systems in India so that we not only emerge as a global leader in this new era but can build models, which are specific to India that will benefit Indians. At the same time, we need a very wide coverage program to build skills to leverage AI to its fullest potential. The biggest contribution we can make to the inclusion of youth in the economic development of the country is by skilling them in new skill areas. In the last few years, the Skill India Mission has trained 14 million youth, reskilled over 5 million youth and established a staggering 3,000 new ITIs. The future of any country will depend as much on capital investments as on skill investments.The focus on agricultural development and support to the farmer continues through direct financial assistance to farmers. The farmers have benefited by getting crop insurance through PM Fasal Bima Yojana. It's not just the farmers, the PM-SVANidhi provides credit assistance to a large number of street vendors.The last few years have seen the journey of affordable housing through Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY). There is a slight increase in allocation to launch a scheme for encouraging the middle class to build or buy new homes. This investment will likely propel a wider economic development and increase employment.India has seen a tremendous rise in entrepreneurship in the last few years. In order to continue the journey and promote new startups, the government proposes to extend certain tax benefits, which are expiring from March 2024 to March 2025. The MSMEs have not been left behind. With a proposal to provide timely finances to such enterprises, the government has paved the way for their growth, so they can look to compete globally.All in all, it’s a truly inclusive budget with a clear focus on development not just by giving away freebies but enabling the people to participate in the economic development activity. While the FM calls the comprehensive GDP - Governance, Development & Performance – to me, this budget is inclusive of another GDP – gender, demography, and professions.","Akhilesh Tuteja is Partner and Head, Clients and Markets, KPMG in India.

‘Enough domestic sources of demand to counter drag from external sector’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/enough-domestic-sources-of-demand-to-counter-drag-from-external-sector/articleshow/107372012.cms,"Do you think the

creates room for lower interest rates?

One of the issues that the Budget has flagged is the demographic challenge and opportunity and the societal change that is taking place. How do you view this?

Niti Aayog is working on the Viksit Bharat roadmap. What will be the focus areas?

You are as much a representative of the Centre as well as the states. Is it time to revisit the entire formula for transfers to states particularly on the issue of cesses and surcharges?

Suman Bery , who heads Niti Aayog , the govt think tank, is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China, which he says is also an opportunity for India. The economist is confident that Indian states remain resilient. Excerpts of the interview with TOI.The finance ministry expects the economy to grow 7% next year.Given the global situation, how do you see the prospects?The belief in the finance ministry is that we have a possible drag coming from the external sector but that we have other sources. We have enough domestic sources of demand. One has to applaud the political and economic judgment of FM in deciding that it was appropriate to pursue the path of fiscal consolidation. There is transparency. What this actually reflects is responsible economic management, which is one reason we are where we are. Second, it also creates a buffer so that there is policy space if we do encounter headwinds.That’s the hope and expectation. We have an independent central bank and an inflation targeting central bank, so it is up to the monetary policy committee to take a call through the monetary policy committee on the repo rate .The PM has said that when India grows its states grow. India is a composite of 37 states and UTs. They are each at very different points in their demographic transition. There are some states where the net replacement rate is down to 1%, like Kerala . There are others, particularly UP and Bihar, which are in their earliest stage of demographic transition and each one of these states is the size of a large European country. There are two implications of that — one is internal labour mobility and it will become an even larger part of our growth model. The govt has taken several steps to create a unified market. Our main endowment is our human capital and that has to be equipped to participate in global exchange in many ways. We know from China, Japan that the demographic dividend partly depends on markets and on human capital. But the golden period is fairly short lived, about 15 years, when the so called dependency ratio declines. The other big opportunity the PM has been highlighting is bringing women much more into the active labour force.When Niti was set up there was the idea of a three-year vision and a seven-year strategy paper. The reality is that schemes of govt tend to be aligned with the award of the Finance Commission . There are various established building blocks or hand holds which are already a matter of govt policy. The PM is much more interested in a national debate on what it means to be a Viksit Bharat or modern society. We have a collective goal and it is for the democratic polity to define what that goal should be. Its emphatically not for a super mandarin bureaucracy. It is not going to be Lee Kwan Yew’s Singapore led from the top.It’s entirely a finance ministry matter but I would be lying if I didn’t say when I visit certain states there is this complaint. A big frontier would be resource mobilisation at the state level. Second is going to be rationalisation of subsidies not only at the Union level, but also at the state level. All chief ministers sit on my governing council. When they convene as the governing council, I see them in their role as development practitioners. The world is beginning to appreciate quite how much institutional and political maturity India attained in our 75 years and the most fundamental dimension of a democracy, we have orderly transfers of power. There are enough buffers to ensure that what happens in state finances is unlikely to create macro instability. Those risks are well contained by our Constitution. The chief ministers know that they are going to be judged by development outcomes and so you can have the sugar rush of changing of pension plans or various handouts but if the cupboard is bare you are not going to be able to deliver.","Suman Bery is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China.

Government's Marathon to 2047: Emphasis on Fiscal Prudence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/governments-marathon-to-2047-emphasis-on-fiscal-prudence/articleshow/107371788.cms,"What was the thinking behind keeping the vote on account absolutely straight?

So is it the idea to keep the Budget completely transparent?

The capex has risen 11.1% and there is an emphasis on infrastructure spending. But there is also the hope that the private sector will now take over and start capital spending. Given the geopolitical situation, how confident is the govt that it will pan out as planned?

Finance secretary T V Somanathan, in an interview with TOI, says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047 . Excerpts:If you see the Budget speech you will see the emphasis on 2047. The govt has set its sight on running that marathon.Running to 2047 is a marathon , it’s not a sprint. If you are going to run a marathon, you need to be in good shape and you can’t have short-term stimulants or something that will get you some yards and then it’s done.The whole focus is on making India a developed country by 2047, for which a healthy present and a strong fiscal position is an important concomitant. Some purely short term measures don’t really fit into that picture. It’s a consistent picture: focus on the long term for which you need to build strength in the short term and that needs to be done by prudence in fiscal policy and by not doing things which can detract you from that path. Not doing the wrong thing is more important than appearing to do things.The idea is that govt finances may be good, bad or indifferent depending on the times, depending on the circumstances, depending on the policies. But what is the position should be reflected as reasonably and accurately as possible. That is an emphasis. As regards the Finance Commission, again the terms of reference that have been given to them are the terms in the Constitution.What is the means by which the devolution should be done is a matter they have full discretion. They can actually take all kinds of factors into account and in a sense we felt this time based on my review of the previous commissions that the right expression would be less is more. The shorter, less prescriptive terms of reference gives full scope for all stakeholders including state govts to express their viewpoints and for the commission to take a balanced view of the different perspectives and then come to its award. Ultimately the award of the Finance Commission is about devolution and grant for which full scope has now been given to them.n There are incipient signs of private capital expenditure accelerating. There are some surveys I have seen done by some of the chambers industry, which show high levels of investment. The PMI, which is a sort of leading indicator, is also looking pretty healthy. Capacity utilisation is one reason that private sector capital expenditure doesn’t immediately pick up when the economy starts accelerating because there is surplus capacity.But increasingly I get the sense that many industries are beginning to reach levels where they have to add capacity. When that happens capital investment will happen. Another pointer also mentioned in the Budget speech you may notice that our airlines have placed large orders for planes — that is capital expenditure.When you import 1,000 aircraft, it’s just not 1,000 aircraft, there are concomitant additions to ground handling facilities, you need airports to expand, you need to employ people to do that. That means a lot of jobs. The aircraft is capital but then look at the effect it is going to have on skilled jobs. So capital expenditure is happening. I am fairly confident that we will have decent capital expenditure in the year to come and that will become a new source of acceleration.",Finance secretary T V Somanathan says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047.

Income Tax Changes Budget 2024 : In the recent Budget 2024 speech, the Finance Minister kept the Section 80C tax deduction limit unchanged. The maximum limit for claiming tax benefits under Section 80C remains at Rs 1.5 lakh for the current fiscal year 2023-24 and will stay the same for individuals looking to save on taxes through Section 80C investments in the upcoming fiscal year 2024-25.Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions. Individuals can reduce their gross taxable income by up to Rs 1.5 lakh per financial year by engaging in these specific investments or expenditures.You can save on taxes through Section 80C by investing in things like Employees' Provident Fund (EPF), Public Provident Fund (PPF), Equity Linked Saving Scheme (ELSS) mutual funds, National Savings Certificate (NSC), and 5-year tax-saving fixed deposits with banks or post offices. Additionally, paying life insurance policy premiums also qualifies for tax benefits under Section 80C.It is important to note that each eligible investment comes with its specific maximum limit, rate of return, liquidity, and taxation rules for the earned returns, states ET in a report. For instance, the most you can invest in PPF in a financial year is Rs 1.5 lakh. Meanwhile, there's no limit on the amount you can invest in ELSS mutual funds, but the Section 80C deduction is capped at Rs 1.5 lakh.If individuals can't make specific investments, they can still get deductions under Section 80C from their gross taxable income through certain expenses. These expenses include repaying the principal amount of a home loan, tuition fees for children, payment of stamp duty, registration fees, and other costs related to buying a house.Since the financial year 2020-21, individuals without any business income must annually choose between the old and new tax regimes. As of the fiscal year 2023-24, the new tax regime is the default option. Consequently, individuals seeking tax deductions under Section 80C must opt for the old tax regime since this deduction isn't available in the new tax regime. It's crucial for taxpayers to be aware of these rules to make informed decisions about their tax planning and investment strategies.","Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget which is an interim budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year. The budget talks about inclusive development both, social and geographical, especially for youth, women, farmers, and the poor. Continued focus on improving logistics through infrastructure spend on roads, rail, airports, ports increases productivity for companies and citizens alike.To make ‘Viksit Bharat’ by 2047, the government’s focus is on improving and empowering people’s capabilities through various skilling initiatives. It is encouraging to see that Skill India Mission has succeeded in training more than 1.4 crore youth and upskilling and reskilling 54 lakh youth. I am particularly happy to see the continued focus on youth and women entrepreneurship and the announcement of a new fund which will give interest free 50 year loans for startups will provide a domestic fillip to startups supplementing venture capital we have traditionally relied on from abroad.PM Mudra Yojana has sanctioned 43 crore loans aggregating to 22.5 lakh crore to youth entrepreneurs and thirty crore Mudra Yojana loans to women entrepreneurs. There are several other schemes like Fund of Funds, Start-Up India, and Start-Up Credit Guarantee schemes that are assisting our youth. Further, the extension of tax benefits to Start-ups and investments made by sovereign wealth funds/pension funds, till 31st March 2025 depicts the government’s effort to support the startup eco- system.This aligns quite well with India Sanitation Coalition’s efforts to give impetus to the start-up world. Over the past 7 editions of our ISC-FICCI Sanitation Awards, we have recognized and promoted several start-ups in the sanitation space, many of whom are successful businesses now!While the finance minister did not provide detailed information on Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH), the budget allocation sees a slight increase in spend demonstrating continued focus on this highly successful program. The acknowledgement that the private sector has increasingly played a substantial role in addressing WASH issues in both urban and rural areas, with numerous projects underway through Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs), highlights the government's commitment to addressing challenges in this sector.A perfect example is the LightHouse Initiative initiated by the Department of Drinking Water along with the India Sanitation Coalition (ISC) by partnering with major corporates across India to develop model villages in Solid and Liquid Waste Management (SLWM) under SBM-Grameen. From this budget, there is an expectation that the government will persist in prioritizing Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) as the path toward achieving the country's Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6). Additionally, it is hoped that the government will uphold its commitment to making necessary infrastructural investments for SLWM.The budget speech rightly celebrates the fact that we have 83 lakh SHGs and 9 crore women beneficiaries. The microfinance movement in the country and the possibility of empowering women members of SHGs through livelihood skilling is a key to bringing women into mainstream economic advancement.The focus on green growth, rooftop solar, wind, biomass, e-vehicles all help with our green energy thrust. The tourism sector was mentioned and could be a huge job provider for youth and women.Guided by the principle ‘Reform, Perform, and Transform’, the budget emphasizes efficient implementation of various policies by improving coordination with states and relevant stakeholders. This is critical both for infra spend and social programsIt is noteworthy that ISC’s Climate Resilient Coastal Cities project which is being implemented in PPP (Public-Private Partnership) mode in four coastal states of Karnataka, Gujarat, Goa and Maharashtra is congruent with the government’s priority of promoting climate-resilient activities for the blue economy 2.0, a scheme for restoration and adaptation measures, and coastal aquaculture.The budget also focuses on the Aspirational districts program where assistance will be given to the states for faster development of aspirational districts and blocks, including the generation of ample economic opportunities. This is again very crucial as it has a huge potential to transform the landscape of our country while making sure no -one is left behind.Overall, this budget has embraced economic strategies and develops the building blocks that nurture and uphold growth, promote inclusive and sustainable development, and enhance productivity.","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year. Continued focus on improving logistics through infrastructure spend on roads, rail, airports, ports increases productivity for companies and citizens alike.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-107357973,imgsize-300646,width-400,resizemode-4/107357973.jpg"

At present, only around 30-40% of the EV supply chain is localised, said the ICRA report.Chassis components that require minimal technology upgradation are manufactured locally though there has been substantial localisation in traction motors, control units and battery management systems over the years. However, advance chemistry batteries, which remain the most critical and the costliest component, accounting for almost 35-40% of the vehicle price, are imported. Hence the opportunity for local component companies as EV makers localise.ICRA expects EVs to account for around 25% of domestic two-wheeler sales and 15% of passenger vehicle sales by 2030, translating into strong market potential for EV components.","ICRA expects at least Rs 25,000 crore of capex for EV components in the next three-four years.

As Bitcoin recently experienced a dip and many top coins faced severe volatility, savvy investors are being extra careful to avoid poor investment decisions. The market is currently uncertain now that the Bitcoin halving is approaching, and several token holders are on their toes.Amid the uncertainty, meme coin holders are experiencing less panic as some meme coins have been shown to be gearing forward, despite the gloomy market.Most of these top meme coins are receiving more support than ever, as Dogecoin itself just gained over 11% in daily trading activity, taking its TVL above $2.1 billion.Generally, the meme coin market offers an enormous number of opportunities; however, these five meme coins introduced in this article are among good choices if you are looking to garner unprecedented gains by this year’s Q4.Here are the tokens.Here’s a brief overview of their different characteristics and potential for year-long growth.The KangaMoon (KANG) meme coin is making waves with its unique blend of GameFi’s play-to-earn and SocialFi features, which has attracted a growing user base of over 20,000 community members and substantial investments. What sets KangaMoon apart is its innovative approach to combining entertainment and passive income opportunities.By leveraging this unique blend, users can immerse themselves in virtual combat, bet on outcomes, and earn KANG tokens, creating an engaging ecosystem that appeals to both gamers and investors alike. With over $5 million raised and ongoing success in presale stages, KangaMoon is on track to surpass $7 million by the end of April.This impressive run further positions KangaMoon as a strong contender in the meme coin arena alongside top meme coins like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. For DeFi enthusiasts seeking promising opportunities in the meme coin market, KangaMoon stands out as a compelling choice.The recent surge in the $KANG token's value, from $0.005 to $0.0196, reflects a 290% ROI for early buyers while demonstrating a significant bullish momentum. As such, projections suggest a potential price range of $2 to $5 by the fourth quarter of 2024, driven by KangaMoon's strategic roadmap, including a Tier-1 listing, which could propel its value even further.Bonk, a meme coin with a dog theme running on the Solana network, is carving its niche by offering practical utility rarely seen in meme coins. Its primary goal is to enhance liquidity in decentralised exchanges (DEXs) on Solana, attracting attention for its real-world application within the crypto ecosystem.Bonk's decentralised finance (DeFi) philosophy is defined by the distribution of airdrops to Solana's community and a strong emphasis on community-driven progress. This utility-centric approach distinguishes Bonk from its memecoin counterparts, positioning it as a potential standout performer amid the bullish trends of 2024.Floki Inu has become widely popular as a meme-based digital currency. However, its appeal goes beyond mere humour. Floki Inu is actively developing a utility for its FLOKI token within a diverse ecosystem covering DeFi, NFTs, and the Metaverse. While initial adoption outside its ecosystem is limited, Floki Inu is pioneering initiatives like Valhalla, an NFT game offering FLOKI token rewards.Additionally, FlokiFi is gearing up to launch innovative DeFi products such as FlokiFi Locker, prioritising asset security. Floki Inu's expansion plans include a marketplace for NFTs and merchandise alongside a crypto education platform within its metaverse, aiming to drive awareness and utility for FLOKI tokens.Dogwifhat, a new meme coin on Solana, has quickly risen to compete with established coins like BONK in terms of market cap, reflecting the ever-evolving nature of meme coins. Unlike utility tokens, Dogwifhat's value is primarily driven by cultural significance and community interest rather than inherent functionality.Now among the top meme coins, Dogwifhat symbolises the tokenisation of cultural attention and embodies the speculative nature of cryptocurrencies fueled by community engagement. Its rapid growth within the Solana ecosystem highlights the captivating and volatile dynamics of the crypto market, where cultural narratives and community sentiment play a significant role in asset valuation.PEPE coin has demonstrated phenomenal potential for growth. Its rapid ascent into the top 50 by market cap and subsequent ranking at number 46 on CoinMarketCap underscore its promising trajectory. This impressive performance suggests that PEPE has captured significant attention and investor interest, indicating the possibility of further market penetration and value appreciation.The explosive rise of PEPE, achieving a $1 billion market cap in just 20 days and experiencing a staggering 7,000% surge in value within 17 days, showcases its ability to disrupt and captivate the meme coin industry. With such remarkable achievements in a short span, PEPE's signal is an intriguing asset to watch for potential continued growth in the meme coin market impact.The global cryptocurrency market cap has increased by 4% in the last few days as the crypto market is already recovering from the brief bearish wave in some top crypto coins . While anticipation for Bitcoin halving continues to build up, it is advisable to remember that diversification is best done early and strategically.In any case, do your own research (DYOR) about the coins of choice ahead of investment and avoid making uninformed decisions. Finally, if you want to join savvy investors in trading with the top meme coins positioned for growth, look no further than the crypto as mentioned earlier, coins highlighted in this article.Explore the thrilling opportunities available in the KangaMoon (KANG) presale today!Website: https://KangaMoon.com/ Join the Telegram community: https://t.me/KangaMoonofficial",KangaMoon ($KANG) is a GameFi and SocialFi meme coin poised to succeed in the DeFi market.

Reliance Retail’s Smart & Smart Bazaar embrace premiumisation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/reliance-retails-smart-smart-bazaar-embrace-premiumisation/articleshow/109525439.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a move signaling a strategic shift towards catering to a more diverse clientele, Reliance Retail ’s value-format grocery chains, Smart and Smart Bazaar announced the diversification of its product portfolio to include premium offerings.The grocery retail chains introduced a range of upscale products, including international delicacies, luxury body mists, and high-end serums, the retailer said in its latest quarterly report.“That’s a trend we are seeing across consumption baskets where there is customer focus towards premiumisation,” said Dinesh Taluja, CFO, Reliance Retail. “What we are seeing is average bill values are going up driven by premiumisation, which also drives better margins. In addition, share of non-grocery is increasing, too, which is driving the margins for this business.”Reliance Retail, India’s largest retailer, said its grocery business delivered another quarter of steady performance led by Smart and Smart Bazaar.The recent success of Smart & Smart Bazaar's flagship event, the 'Full Paisa Vasool Sale,' witnessed 21% year-on-year increase in sales, with key contributors being the household and personal care, confectionery, and snacks categories. Similarly, the retailer said, Smart & Smart Bazaar's deeper regional presence has proven to be a significant driver of growth, with unique regional nuances offering strong opportunities for expansion.“We are building the deepest regional network of stores in the country,” said Taluja. “So, providing regional assortment combined with national assortment provides a very strong value proposition for the customer.”Notably, sales in certain markets during the lead-up to Holi surpassed those during the traditionally festive season of Diwali. “Now, as you know Diwali is the biggest consumption period in the country. But for the first time , we saw that the sale during the pre-Holi period was very strong in few markets and that is probably being driven by the regional insights we have on the assortment, as well the communication we do regionally,” he said.Reliance Retail’s Grocery New Commerce business segment witnessed notable growth during the quarter, driven by the successful onboarding of new kirana partners through initiatives like the ""Metro Kirana Utsav."" Additionally, the HoReCa segment experienced growth as Smart & Smart Bazaar continued to forge partnerships with institutional customers, further diversifying its revenue streams.","Reliance Retail’s value-format grocery chains, Smart and Smart Bazaar announced the diversification of its product portfolio to include premium offerings.

The European Union ( EU ) last week adopted a “more favourable” visa regime for Indians “with an established travel history , if (their) passport validity allows.” They will now get up to five-year validity Schengen visas.Though less than America’s 10-year visitor visas and United Kingdom’s option of getting a visa valid for up to the same period by paying over 1lakh as fees, EU officials told TOI five years is also “a big step”.“According to the newly adopted visa ‘cascade’ regime for India, Indian nationals can now be issued long-term, multi-entry Schengen visas valid for two years after having obtained and lawfully used two visas within the previous three years. The two-year visa will normally be followed by a five-year visa, if the passport has sufficient validity remaining. During the validity period of these visas, holders enjoy travel rights equivalent to visa-free nationals,” the EU said in a statement.The decision was taken on April 18, because of “strengthened relations under the EU-India common agenda on migration and mobility, which seeks comprehensive cooperation on migration policy between the EU and India, with facilitation of people-to-people contacts being of key aspect due to the importance of India as a partner for the EU.”Before this change, Schengen countries mostly granted short term visas even to frequent travellers to Europe. Six-month, two and five-year visas have been a rarity in India.And it’s not the visa fees that has to be paid time and again that frequent flyers frown at. The hassle of arranging paperwork for submission time and again is what they find most irksome.“My clients are often nervous that their visa is expiring the day they have to fly back from Europe to India. The most common question is what happens if they miss the flight or it is cancelled,” said a leading travel agent who did not want to be named. For “established travel history” Indians, that should be a thing of the past now.Schengen visas allow the holder to travel freely in the Schengen area for short stays of a maximum of 90 days in any 180-day period.

He had tried to break open three houses in the area in vain before jamming open the kitchen window of the director’s house. The locker in which the gold was kept was not locked,” police said.Interestingly, the accused’s wife is a Sitamarhi district panchayat council member and he used it to his advantage. The car which he was using had the board of the district panchayat which helped him evade police inspections to an extent, police said.City police commissioner Shyamsundar said it was a proud moment for Kochi police to have arrested the accused within 15 hours after the crime. As much as 1.20-cr worth of gold ornaments and valuables was stolen from the house.Irfan is also accused in a case registered by Museum police in 2021 when ornaments worth Rs 2.5 lakh and Rs 60,000 in cash were stolen from the house of a prominent jewelry chain owner.Museum police said attempts were made to get him in custody when Goa police had arrested him, but this didn’t pan out due to the pandemic. We would soon record his arrest and take him into custody after getting permission from the court in Kochi, said a Museum police officer.The team of Kochi police which made the arrest under DCP K S Sudarshan and ACP P Rajkumar included Inspectors Premananda Krishnan and Richard Varghese. Sub-inspectors Anil, Vishnu and Ravi, ASIs Jossy, Anil, Saneep and Prashant were also part of the team apart from Pramod and Vipin of the cyber wing.The commissioner said coordination with the help of Raman Gupta IPS of Karnataka police also helped in arresting the accused.","Muhammed Irfan alias Bihar ‘Robin Hood’ (35), son of Muhammed Akthar of Sitamarhi in Bihar -- was arrested for the burglary at the house of film director Joshiy’s son Abhilash Joshiy at Panampilly Nagar.

Italy survives S&P scrutiny of Giorgia Meloni’s worsened debt trajectory,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/italy-survives-sp-scrutiny-of-giorgia-melonis-worsened-debt-trajectory/articleshow/109473623.cms,"Italy’s credit status remains intact at S&P Global Ratings, which enacted the first major scrutiny on a worsened trajectory for debt foreseen by Premier Giorgia Meloni ’s government.In a statement on Friday, the company listed the euro zone’s third-biggest economy as one of the sovereigns that it had just reviewed without issuing any analysis.The country is still assessed at BBB, or two notches above junk, with a stable outlook that signals it isn’t in imminent danger of a downgrade.This was the first in this year’s assessments by major ratings companies on Italy’s credit status, and the judgment took on some significance after the government’s implicit acknowledgment this month that its debt-cutting efforts have not only stalled, but look likely to go into reverse.The S&P decision keeps Italy out of the spotlight after a period of calm for the country in financial markets. Earlier this year, the extra yield paid for Italian debt over German equivalents fell to a two-year low.That partly reflected the restraint for the public finances that Meloni’s coalition has preached since coming to power in late 2022, all while treading a fine line that still allowed for some fiscal loosening.The strategy has paid off until now, with Moody’s even removing its threat of a cut to junk.Italy’s fiscal position has been eroded however by the impact of rising interest rates and economic weakness in neighbors such as Germany.Just this week, the International Monetary Fund made its own prediction that a period of post-pandemic debt reduction has ended for the country, with its borrowings now set to rise over the next half decade.The government’s recently published forecasts acknowledged a change in direction too. They indicate Italy’s debt pile will peak at 139.8% of output in 2026, while the IMF reckons that it will breach 140% as soon as next year.Those projections by the treasury were based on a far rosier outlook for economic growth this year, anticipating 1% expansion, compared with 0.6% seen by both the Bank of Italy and many private-sector forecasters.The government numbers didn’t reflect potential legislation, because Italy is transitioning to a new system of fiscal oversight by European Union authorities. More detailed figures won’t be published until September, after the upcoming EU elections.That timetable may tempt Meloni to delay tough decisions such as whether to cancel promised tax cuts or aid to companies and citizens until the vote is over. At that point, EU pressure to enact such measures is likely to increase so as to comply with newly reinstated stability pact rules.S&P’s rivals Fitch Ratings and Moody’s are scheduled to issue potential assessments on Italy on May 3 and May 31 respectively.","The country is still assessed at BBB, or two notches above junk, with a stable outlook that signals it isn’t in imminent danger of a downgrade.

World Bank and IMF meetings conclude without concrete plan to mobilize trillions for climate change,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/world-bank-and-imf-meetings-conclude-without-concrete-plan-to-mobilize-trillions-for-climate-change/articleshow/109472712.cms,"NEW DELHI: The World Bank and IMF meetings concluded without a definitive strategy to secure the necessary funds for combating climate change, a crucial issue for the upcoming COP29 conference in Azerbaijan. The New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG), which determines the annual financial support developed countries must provide to developing nations from 2025 onwards, will be a central topic at the conference.Despite repeated failures, wealthy nations are anticipated to contribute more than the previously committed USD 100 billion per year from 2020.Recent data shows that financial inflows to developing countries turned negative in 2023, with these nations paying more in debt servicing than they received in external financing. Discussions among G7 and G20 finance ministers during the spring meetings focused on providing financial support to developing countries for achieving climate and development goals. The Vulnerable Group of Twenty Countries (V20) urged increased concessional finance for climate-vulnerable nations and called on G7 and high-emitting G21 countries to protect the 1.5 degrees Celsius limit. The Intergovernmental Group of Twenty-Four on International Monetary Affairs and Development (G24) advocated for reforms to ensure timely assistance to vulnerable nations and urged changes to theG20 Common Framework to support countries in debt distress.World Bank president Ajay Banga expressed optimism that donor contributions could provide an additional USD 100 billion to the poorest countries through the International Development Association (IDA). The Bank had previously launched an initiative to increase financing for low-income countries through low-cost financing and grants, with shareholders expected to pledge to the IDA before the replenishment conference in December. While Banga reaffirmed the Bank's commitment to increasing climate-aligned finance, he stated that the Bank has no intention of halting investments in gas projects.IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva highlighted that the global economy had lost USD 3.3 trillion since 2020, with the poorest countries spending over 14 percent of their budgets on debt payments, exacerbated by rising interest rates. A report by the Debt Relief for Green and Inclusive Recovery Project (DRGR) revealed that 47 emerging and developing market economies may be unable to allocate necessary funds for climate adaptation and development without risking default in the next five years.Discussions on international taxation for climate action took place, with the International Tax Task Force launching its first phase of work to assist countries in fulfilling their Paris Agreement commitments. The task force, co-chaired by Kenya, Barbados, and France, aims to explore options for international levies to raise revenues for combating climate change and supporting development and nature. Finance ministers of Brazil and France led discussions on a wealth tax of at least 2 percent of billionaires' wealth annually, which could raise USD 250 billion to address poverty, hunger, and climate change. The IMF endorsed the proposal, which is being supported by the Brazilian G20 presidency.Pepukaye Bardouille, Director of Bridgetown Initiative and Special Adviser on Climate Resilience, Barbados Prime Minister's Office, acknowledged progress in recent months but emphasized the USD 3 trillion funding gap for achieving sustainable development goals and addressing the climate crisis. Bardouille stressed the need for countries from the Global South to speak up more to ensure that funds reach those who need them most, calling for the tripling of IDA by 2030, concessional 50-year loans for low-income and vulnerable middle-income countries, and new funding streams from the wealthiest and most polluting sectors.Rachel Kyte, Professor of Practice in Climate Policy, Blavatnik School of Government, Oxford University, highlighted the growing net outflows of finance from emerging markets and developing countries, exacerbating the challenges posed by climate change. Kyte emphasized the need for shareholders to do more to support these nations in their efforts to overcome these obstacles.","The World Bank and IMF meetings concluded without a definitive strategy to secure the necessary funds for combating climate change.

Volkswagen's Tennessee workers vote to join UAW trade union,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/volkswagens-tennessee-workers-vote-to-join-uaw-trade-union/articleshow/109470281.cms,"Wage deals with 'Big Three,' Biden on Detroit picket

Workers at German car giant Volkswagen 's Chattanooga factory in Tennessee have voted to join the United Auto Workers trade union, in a major boost for the largest car union in the US outside its powerbase in Detroit.Well over half of eligible workers cast ballots, making the result binding.And of those who voted, 2,628 were in favor and 985 against, a 73% level of support for unionizing.Workers celebrated the result, cheering and waving their ""Union Yes"" campaign posters as the outcome was announced late on Friday.Even President Joe Biden commented on the results, having voiced support for the move in the run-up.""Together, these union wins have helped raise wages and demonstrate once again that the middle-class built America and that unions are still building and expanding the middle class for all workers,"" he said in a statement.Union presence rare in US South and WestFriday's result will make Chattanooga the first auto plant in the South to unionize via an election since the 1940s, and the first foreign-owned plant in the South to do so.VW held a neutral posture in the vote, with unionization the norm at its facilities around the world, including in its native Germany. It used to have a UAW presence at its defunct plant in Pennsylvania far to the north, until that closed in 1988. So the vote appears more likely to lead to a deal rather than deadlock.UAW President Shawn Fain has been trying to extend the influence of the US' main car workers' union beyond the historic automotive capital of Detroit where it's focused.Fain and his team have committed to spending more than $40 million (€37.5 million) through 2026 in a bid to unionize plants owned by a variety of carmakers in other parts of the US, including Tesla.""I'm exhilarated that we actually accomplished what set out to accomplish,"" VW employee Lisa Elliott said after the results were announced. ""Tell Mercedes they're next.""That was a reference to a Mercedes plant in Alabama, which will be the next facility to hold a UAW election during the week of May 13.It was the third attempt to affiliate with UAW at the factory, with votes in 2014 and 2019 narrowly failing. Other votes at other factories, like a Nissan facility in Mississippi in 2017, also failed.But this year's vote had coincided with a boost in public support for unions in the US, which can be fairly skeptical of organized labor by international standards.Republican governors in six southern states, including Tennessee, have spoken out against the move to unionize car plants in recent months.The UAW last year securing big pay settlements with the ""Big Three"" US carmakers — General Motors, Ford and Stellantis (more commonly still called Chrysler) — after President Biden walked a Detroit picket line also brought the group into public focus.The union has indicated it is also eyeing a Hyundai factory in Alabama and a Toyota facility in Missouri where it says that more than 30% of staff have already signed cards indicating they want a vote on joining.","VW workers in Tennessee vote to join United Auto Workers trade union.

Bitcoin Halving 2024: 'Halving' arrives for bitcoin miners,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/halving-arrives-for-bitcoin-miners/articleshow/109464006.cms,"Controlling supply

Reduced margins

NEW YORK: The bitcoin market on Friday engineered the ""halving"" of the reward for operating the cryptocurrency , a much-anticipated step designed to limit production and boost the digital money.""The 4th #Bitcoin halving is complete!,"" announced cryptocurrency exchange Binance on X, the former Twitter.""The countdown has been reset -- see you in 2028.""Bitcoin is created as a reward when computers solve complex puzzles to decide which miner wins the privilege to validate the block -- and receive the reward in bitcoins.However, since the digital currency's launch in 2009, the reward has been halved for every 210,000 blocks in a process called halving.With one block validated roughly every ten minutes, this critical industry event occurs just under every four years.The reward, which was fixed since May 2020 at 6.25 bitcoins per new block, has now fallen to 3.125 bitcoins.Bitcoin was conceived in 2008 by a person or group writing under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto.The halving process slows the rate at which new bitcoins are created, thereby restricting supply .The reward amount has been trimmed over time, via halving, to implement Nakamoto's overall global limit of 21 million bitcoins.But this ceiling is due to be reached by 2040.""The primary purpose of halving is to control bitcoin's supply,"" City Index analyst Matthew Weller said in a research note ahead of the event.""By slowing the rate at which new bitcoins are created, halving helps to maintain scarcity and potentially increase the cryptocurrency's value , assuming demand remains steady or increases,"" he added.The price of bitcoin has blazed a record-breaking trail on the prospect of reduced supplies, as well as big moves toward greater trading accessibility.Bitcoin has rocketed by 50 percent in value since the start of the year, climaxing last month at a record $73,797. Prices have fallen in recent days.""This is the first time that bitcoin beat the previous historical record before the halving has even taken place,"" said eToro analyst Simon Peters, noting there had been a pullback in recent days.Commercial bitcoin mining companies operate thousands of computers in huge hangers or warehouses, consuming large amounts of electricity at a vast cost.Halving therefore represents a major survival test for such companies because it slashes their main income source.Faced with the prospect of reduced margins, bitcoin players have invested heavily in cutting-edge new computers, in tandem with an efficiency drive which in particular seeks to slash energy costs.In addition, some mining companies will have to ""turn off some of their machines to cut costs, which equates to fewer bitcoins being created,"" said Manuel Valente, founder of cryptoasset investment group Coinhouse.""And if the price of bitcoin goes down, their profitability decreases"" further, he told AFP.Halving therefore exposes the weakest bitcoin mining firms, and could potentially spark a fresh wave of sector consolidation in a survival of the fittest, commentators say.At around 0030 GMT, after the halving had taken place, the price of bitcoin was up 0.7 percent at $63,467.46.","The ""halving"" of the reward for operating the cryptocurrency bitcoin has taken place.

US debt: Worsening US government debt outlook seen more in gold and bitcoin than in bonds,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/worsening-us-debt-outlook-seen-more-in-gold-and-bitcoin-than-in-bonds/articleshow/109463986.cms,"Concern about the rapidly rising US government debt is partly behind recent surges in gold prices and bitcoin , even as the Treasury market so far remains relatively sanguine about the country's fiscal path , market observers say.The US budget deficit widened to $1.7 trillion in fiscal year 2023 and is on track to reach $2.6 trillion by 2034, according to the Congressional Budget Office.US government debt held by the public, meanwhile, is on pace to reach a record 106% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2028, up from 97% in fiscal year 2023. It has soared to $27 trillion from $17 trillion in early 2020 and $5 trillion in 2007.The unchecked growth of US government debt is gaining more attention as interest rate payments also take a larger bite of the government's budget - in some months exceeding spending on national defense.This worsening trajectory has boosted demand for bitcoin and gold, which are often used as a hedge against inflation and the depreciating purchasing power of the US currency.“Concerns about the US debt cycle, devaluation of money - and fiat money in particular - does drive the story and the narrative,” said Brad Bechtel, global head of FX at Jefferies.That “at the margin pushes investors to allocate more towards something like (bitcoin) than they otherwise would,” and for gold “it’s even bigger there,” Bechtel said. “Concerns about debasing of fiat money is generally one of the drivers of the gold bugs.Yields in Treasury debt largely reflect expectations of Federal Reserve interest rate policy. At times they are swayed by increases in debt supply, though the longer-term fiscal trajectory is less of a factor in the market.The US central bank has intermittently purchased Treasuries in an effort to stimulate growth, which can pull yields lower and increase the supply of dollars.Supply disruptions, record government spending and ultra loose monetary policy as businesses were shut down for Covid in 2020 led to soaring prices pressures that have still not completely abated.“There’s interest in both gold and bitcoin because of that, because inflation’s been unsteady in the last couple of years,” said Lawrence H. White, professor of economics at George Mason Univer sity.More concerning is that the rising debt and deficit “is in peace time with an economy that’s running at full employment… that’s normally when you should be running surpluses and we’re not even close,” White said. “So, in the next recession we’re going to have an even bigger jump up in debt.”Certainly there are other major factors driving the interest in bitcoin and gold.Bitcoin has been buoyed by new exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that invest in the cryptocurrency, drawing in more investors. It is also approaching a halving, when the rewards from mining bitcoin are cut by 50%.That has traditionally been bullish for bitcoin, said Bechtel. Bitcoin reached a record $73,803 in March.The gold surge is also being driven by expectations of central bank rate cuts and purchases by foreign central banks diversifying their reserves. This is partly due to inflation concerns , and also a way to protect against possible US sanctions in a geopolitical dispute.Gold hit a record $2,431 per ounce last week.But the rapidly worsening US fiscal situation remains a key driver for some investors.Michael Hartnett, investment strategist at Bank of America, said in a recent report that recent highs in gold and tech stocks are indicating that the “parlous state of US govt finances"" will inevitably lead to policies including yield curve control “to prevent (a) debt crisis.”In yield curve control a central bank buys bonds in order to maintain a target interest rate, which can reduce government borrowing costs.So far, however, several Treasury market indicators show that bonds are not pricing in a worsening fiscal outlook, said Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research.These include 10-year Treasury yields trading well below those on three-month notes. Real 10-year yields, which “reflect all risks other than future inflation,” are also around the same level as from 2003–2007, when the debt to GDP ratio was half of what it is now.Treasury investors ""still see the dollar as the reserve currency, they still see Treasuries as relatively safe and there’s enough Treasuries out there to put money to work,” Colas said. “If you’re looking for risk free assets in size the Treasury market’s still the place to go.”",US budget deficit widened to $1.7 trillion in fiscal year 2023 and is on track to reach $2.6 trillion by 2034. US government debt held by the public is on pace to reach a record 106% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2028.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109463995,imgsize-238398,width-400,resizemode-4/109463995.jpg"

The statement came as this week's meetings of the IMF and World Bank drew to a close.Governors of the institutions urged the World Bank to continue to bolster global and regional partnerships, and asked its management to push ahead with country engagement reforms and enhanced country diagnostics.They also encouraged further collaboration between the World Bank and IMF to help countries mobilize more revenues at home, and on issues such as climate change and pandemic preparedness, as well as debt sustainability.","The steering committee for the IMF and World Bank emphasized the need for broader accountability.
