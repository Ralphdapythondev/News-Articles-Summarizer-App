This marked the tenth consecutive session of gains for the Nifty.Similarly, the BSE Sensex extended its winning streak to the seventh day, climbing 73.80 points or 0.09 per cent to close at 81,785.56.During the trading session, the Sensex jumped 327.5 points or 0.40 per cent to reach an intra-day high of 82,039.26.The gains were primarily driven by buying in IT stocks and supported by positive global market sentiment, recent foreign fund inflows, and lower global crude oil prices.Among the Sensex constituents, Bharti Airtel, Infosys, IndusInd Bank, Sun Pharma, Tech Mahindra, Mahindra & Mahindra, Bajaj Finance, and JSW Steel were the top gainers. On the other hand, Asian Paints, Maruti, Nestle, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Axis Bank, and UltraTech Cement were among the laggards.In the Asian markets, Seoul and Tokyo ended higher, while Shanghai and Hong Kong closed lower. European markets were trading in positive territory, and the US markets had marginal gains on Tuesday.According to V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, ""The market has entered a consolidation phase with low volatility and this trend is likely to continue in the near-term.

Foreign investors dump $3.42 billion worth ‘expensive Indian stocks’; opt for IPOs instead,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/foreign-investors-dump-3-42-billion-worth-expensive-indian-stocks-opt-for-ipos-instead/articleshow/112829480.cms,"Foreign investors are selling their positions in pricey Indian equities and opting for new offerings in primary markets as they pursue more affordable access to the market and higher returns. Their selling has been motivated by profit-taking as Indian stocks trade at all-time highs and at valuations exceeding those of most major stock markets, according to a Reuters report.Instead, investors are investing in initial public offerings ( IPOs ), where valuations are lower and there is less competition for stocks.According to India's Central Depository Services Ltd data quoted by Reuters, foreigners have sold a net $3.42 billion worth of equities in the secondary market so far, while purchasing a net $1.47 billion through primary market issuances this month.A Societe Generale (SG) report reveals that foreigners have acquired more than $6 billion of stocks on the primary market this year, the highest since 2021.""Foreign investors are shying from deploying funds into secondary market for long term and seeing better and faster return prospects in the primary market,"" said Rajat Agarwal, Asia equity strategist at SG.Also Read | Who are India’s richest investors?

SEBI bans Anil Ambani & 24 other entities from securities market for 5 years; imposes Rs 25 crore penalty on Ambani,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sebi-bans-anil-ambani-24-other-entities-from-securities-market-for-5-years-imposes-rs-25-crore-penalty-on-ambani/articleshow/112730559.cms,"The Securities and Exchange Board of India ( Sebi ) has taken action against Anil Ambani and 24 other entities, including former key officials of Reliance Home Finance ( RHFL ), for their involvement in the diversion of funds from the company. Ambani has been barred from the securities market for five years and fined Rs 25 crore, according to a PTI report.Additionally, he is prohibited from holding any position as a director or Key Managerial Personnel (KMP) in any listed company or intermediary registered with Sebi during this period, the report said.RHFL has also been barred from the securities market for six months and fined Rs 6 lakh. Sebi's extensive investigation revealed that Anil Ambani, aided by RHFL's key managerial personnel, had devised a fraudulent scheme to siphon off funds from the company by disguising them as loans to entities associated with him.According to the PTI report quoting Sebi’s order, despite clear directives from the Board of Directors to cease such lending practices and regular reviews of corporate loans, the company's management disregarded these orders, indicating a significant failure of governance influenced by certain key managerial personnel under Ambani's influence.Sebi noted that given the circumstances, RHFL itself should not be held equally responsible as the individuals involved in the fraud. The remaining entities were found to have played the role of either recipients of illegally obtained loans or conduits to facilitate the illegal diversion of funds from RHFL.In its final order, Sebi stated, ""existence of a fraudulent scheme, orchestrated by Noticee No. 2 (Anil Ambani) and administered by the KMPs of RHFL, to siphon off funds from the public listed company (RHFL) by structuring them as 'loans' to credit unworthy conduit borrowers, and in turn, to onward borrowers, all of whom have been found to be 'promoter linked entities' i.e. entities associated/ linked with Noticee 2 (Anil Ambani)"".Anil Ambani, in his capacity as ""chairperson of the ADA group"" and through his substantial indirect shareholding in RHFL's holding company, orchestrated a fraudulent scheme, the Sebi order said.Sebi's order highlighted the company management and promoter's reckless approach in sanctioning substantial loans to entities with minimal assets, cash flow, net worth, or revenue.The suspicious nature of these ""loans"" is further amplified by the fact that many of the borrowers had close ties to RHFL's promoters. Ultimately, most of these borrowers defaulted on their loan repayments, causing RHFL to fail in meeting its own debt obligations. This led to the company's resolution under the RBI Framework, leaving public shareholders in a precarious situation.RHFL's share price plunged from around Rs 59.60 in March 2018 to a mere Rs 0.75 by March 2020, as the magnitude of the fraud became apparent and the company's resources were depleted. Currently, over 9 lakh shareholders remain invested in RHFL, facing substantial losses.Sebi has restrained 24 entities, including former key officials of RHFL – Amit Bapna, Ravindra Sudhalkar, and Pinkesh R Shah – and imposed fines on them for their involvement in the case. Ambani, Bapna, Sudhalkar, and Shah have been fined Rs 25 crore, Rs 27 crore, Rs 26 crore, and Rs 21 crore, respectively.Furthermore, the remaining entities, including Reliance Unicorn Enterprises, Reliance Exchange next Lt, Reliance Commercial Finance Ltd, Reliance Cleangen Ltd, Reliance Business Broadcast News Holdings Ltd, and Reliance Big Entertainment Private Ltd, have each been fined Rs 25 crore for either receiving the illegally obtained loans or facilitating the illegal diversion of funds from RHFL.In February 2022, Sebi had issued an interim order restraining Reliance Home Finance Ltd, Anil Ambani, and three other individuals (Amit Bapna, Ravindra Sudhakar, and Pinkesh R Shah) from the securities market until further notice for allegedly siphoning off funds from the company.(With inputs from PTI)","Anil Ambani has been barred from the securities market for five years and fined Rs 25 crore. He is prohibited from holding any position as a director or Key Managerial Personnel (KMP) in any listed company or intermediary registered with Sebi. 24 other entities, including former key officials of Reliance Home Finance ( RHFL), have also been fined.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112730920,imgsize-22960,width-400,resizemode-4/112730920.jpg"

The current Banking Regulation Act permits single or joint deposit holders to appoint a nominee for their deposit, items left in the custody of a bank, or a locker hired from a bank.In the event of the nominator's death, the nominee can access the deposit, articles, or locker.According to an ET report, the new Bill suggests allowing up to four nominees for these purposes. For deposits, nominees can be appointed either successively or simultaneously, while for other purposes, they can only be appointed successively.When there are multiple simultaneous nominees, the nomination will be effective in a predetermined proportion. In the case of successive nominations, priority will be given to the nominee named higher in the nomination order.""The Banking Regulation Act allows single or joint deposit holders to appoint a nominee for their deposit. Such a nominee can also be appointed for items left in custody of a bank or for a locker hired from a bank. The nominee can access the deposit, articles, or locker in case of death of the person who nominated him. The Bill allows the appointment of up to four nominees for these purposes. For deposits, such nominees can be appointed either successively or simultaneously while for other purposes they can be appointed successively. In case of simultaneous nominees, the nomination will be effective in a declared proportion. For successive nomination, the nominee who has been named higher in the order of nomination will receive priority,"" according to The Banking Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2024 quoted in the ET report.Also Read | Latest FD rates: Which PSU banks are offering highest fixed deposit rates in August 2024? Check List Nomination is a crucial aspect of opening lockers and savings accounts in India. The Indian Banks' Association (IBA) says, ""Banking Companies (Nomination) Rules 1985 permits banks to pay dues to nominees in the event of death of depositor(s) without asking for succession certificate or verifying claims of legal heirs. This simplifies settlement. Of course, as Trustee the nominee is accountable to legal heirs.The IBA further clarifies that the nomination facility is available for bank deposits, safe deposit lockers, and safe custody articles. A single deposit account, whether held individually or jointly, can have only one nominee. However, a jointly held locker can have two nominees. In the case of a minor's account, a person legally empowered to operate the account can file a nomination on behalf of the minor.The State Bank of India emphasizes the importance of availing the benefits of nomination facility and survivorship clause for locker-hirers. In the unfortunate event of the death of one of the joint locker-hirers, the contents of the locker do not automatically transfer to the surviving joint locker-hirer or nominee(s) unless there is a survivorship clause or nomination in place.When renting a locker, the bank charges a nominal annual rent based on the size of the locker and the location of the branch. The rent should be paid in advance for the financial year. The bank provides a copy of the signed Locker Agreement to the locker-hirer, outlining their rights and responsibilities.","The Banking Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2024 proposes to increase the number of nominees allowed per bank account and locker from one to four.

Source: ET quoting Paisabazaar for interest rates data as on August 14, 2024.

Highest Fixed Deposit Interest Rates: Fixed deposits (FDs) offered by banks are secure and interest-generating investment options. With FDs, you can expect a guaranteed return on your invested funds, which remain unaffected by market fluctuations. This is the reason that FDs are a go to investment option for most risk averse investors.Interest rates for fixed deposits are near all time highs, with RBI pausing the rate cycle for several monetary policy meetings now.Investors have the flexibility to choose between the re-investment deposit option, which allows for the accumulation of compound interest, or the option to receive interest payments at regular intervals (monthly/quarterly) to support their financial planning and budgeting needs, notes an ET report.The interest rates offered on fixed deposits in August 2024 can vary based on several factors, including the specific bank, the age of the depositor, the tenure of the deposit, and the amount invested.In India, private banks are financial institutions where private companies or individuals hold the majority of the equity, in contrast to public-sector banks where the government is the primary shareholder.Public Sector Undertaking (PSU) banks are ones where the government owns the majority of the shares. These banks receive government subsidies with the aim of facilitating their growth and expansion.For investors interested in comparing fixed deposit interest rates between private and public sector banks, a brief analysis of the fixed deposit rates offered to both general citizens and senior citizens is provided below.","Public Banks: Latest Fixed Deposit Interest Rates For General Citizens. Private Banks: Highest Fixed Deposit interest rates for General Citizens and Private Banks. PSU Bank Fixed Deposit Rates: Highest slab, lowest slab, 1-year, 3-year and 5-year tenure.

Sovereign Gold Bonds: How investors can buy SGBs from the stock market; step-by-step guide,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/investing/sovereign-gold-bonds-how-investors-can-buy-sgbs-from-the-stock-market-step-by-step-guide/articleshow/112830983.cms,"How to buy Sovereign Gold Bonds from stock market

To purchase SGBs through the stock market, follow these steps:

Buying SGBs from the stock market: The government introduced Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGBs) in 2015 as a safer alternative to physically holding gold. SGBs eliminate the risks and costs associated with storing physical gold while guaranteeing investors the market value of gold at maturity and monthly interest payments. The bonds are held in the RBI's records or in demat form, mitigating the risk of scrip loss and other related issues.Investors can purchase Sovereign Gold Bonds from the primary market during the government-announced subscription periods or from the secondary market through the National Stock Exchange ( NSE ) and the Bombay Stock Exchange ( BSE ).According to an ET report, if you fail to apply for SGBs during the primary issuance, you can still invest in them through the stock exchanges in the secondary market. The price of SGBs in the secondary market is determined by supply and demand, similar to other securities. Typically, SGBs trade at a discount to the spot price of gold, the ET report said.Step 1: Identify the discounted or high-yielding SGB on NSE or BSE.Step 2: Locate the SGB scrip code in your demat account and place a buy order.Step 3: The bonds will be credited to your demat account within one working day (T+1) of the transaction.Also Read | Sovereign Gold Bonds: RBI announces early redemptions for some SGBs - should investors redeem? The tax treatment for exiting a gold bond investment varies depending on the method chosen. According to the report, the tax treatment differs if you exit your gold bond investment earlier.There are two popular ways to exit a gold bond investment; the first is via the early redemption window at the end of 5 years, and the second is to sell your bonds in the secondary market. In both cases, capital gains will be taxable according to the usual definition of short-term and long-term capital gains. If it is the former, the rate applicable will be at its peak. If it is the latter, then the investor can choose between a flat tax rate of 10% or 20% after considering indexation.The NSE website provides important information about Sovereign Gold Bonds through frequently asked questions section. SGBs can be traded on stock exchanges from a date notified by the RBI, but only bonds held in de-mat form with depositories are eligible for trading. Additionally, bonds can be sold and transferred according to the provisions of the Government Securities Act, 2006, with partial transfers also being possible.Also Read | Top 5 Bank FDs: Which banks offer the best fixed deposit rates? Check List Investors can place bids for SGBs through either Depository Mode or Physical Mode. In Depository Mode, the RBI credits the Gold Bonds to the client's demat account, while in Physical Mode, the RBI issues a physical Gold Bond Certificate to the clients. Bids can be cancelled until the last date of the issue period.Although the term of an SGB is eight years, some investors who purchased SGBs earlier may not be able to hold the bonds for the entire tenure.

After that, it migrated to the main board and soon launched a preferential allotment to entities related to the promoters. Soon after the shares from this allotment were transferred to the promoters through off-market transactions and subsequently sold in the market.

Why it’s time to explore bold & path-breaking alternatives that put Indian Railways on a smooth track,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-its-time-to-explore-bold-path-breaking-alternatives-that-put-indian-railways-on-a-smooth-track/articleshow/112317406.cms,"By Ashutosh Bhandari

Railway Budget 2024 : The government has wavered little in its efforts to spur a modernisation of railways in the country, pivoting on technology, to support the country’s economic ambitions. In line with expectations, Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore, marking yet another year of successive increase in outlay.That takes forward the past policies and the government’s vision, which have paved the way for modernisation of the transport behemoth.In earlier decades, the government had focused on laying tracks on new routes, electrification and incremental rolling stock capacity addition. That was the need of the hour back then and has helped set up the base for a larger transformation.For instance, the massive Dedicated Freight Corridor ( DFC ) as well as locomotive factories at Marhaura and Madhepura in Bihar were conceptualised over a decade ago and we are seeing their completion now.More recently, the focus has shifted to modernisation—of rolling stock and safety systems, among other aspects.This year, emphasis has also been laid on the railways’ crucial role in industrial development. Commodity-specific corridors have been planned in eastern India and impetus given to port connectivity. Vande Bharat and technology-led upgrades in rolling stock remain in focus. Safety has been prioritised through budgetary allocations for the anti-collision systemKavach . That said, there are other cogs in the wheel that demand attention from a long-term perspective.First, the target for the Operating Ratio, the crucial efficiency gauge, has been set at 98.22% for 2024-25, compared with 98.65% in 2023-24. This reflects an imminent need for operational transformation. An effective overhaul of the world’s fourth-largest rail network will take many years and thus we need to start focusing on improving efficiency and reducing costs now.DFC is almost entirely operational and will be complete over the next few months. To ensure the project achieves its twin goals of reducing logistics costs and enhancing freight efficiency, railways need to attract more cargo on the corridor. This will help increase the rail coefficient and make the railways’ approach more market-oriented, which will in turn aid future corridors.A revamp of railway stations is on track, with sufficient funds dedicated to this end. But even though new coaches and wagons are increasingly being added to meet footfalls, the stations and passenger trains themselves remain synonymous with chaos.Just as safety, comfort and convenience have been prioritised, there is a need for solutions to address the capacity and demand challenges. As a first step, the government could target development of new stations and setting up of new coach production units.As a leading freight mover, Indian Railways carried a record 1,588 MT cargo in fiscal 2024, up from 1,095 MT in fiscal 2015. It accounts for 26% of the cargo moved in the country—by no means an easy feat. The railways aims to take this volume to 3,000 MT by 2030, which would require a 11% CAGR against the around 4.2% witnessed over the last 10 years. As per a report by TERI and Shakti Foundation, from carrying about 62% of freight traffic in 1990-91, Indian Railways’ share has declined to ~27% in 2014-15. This has been due to the expanding road network, cost competitiveness over railways, and door-to-door service. Thus, commencing the cycle of increasing the rail share again is commendable.DFCs, a high-capacity track network, high-power locomotives and improvement in wagon designs have set the ball rolling for larger capacity, faster freight trains that deliver better efficiency.Yet, achieving exponential growth is a tall ask given the current dynamics. Possibly, similar challenges might apply to other goals the railways might have for 2047.To be fair, despite its scale and complexity, Indian Railways has been able to achieve diverse developments at commendable speed.But the track ahead is long and it is time to start discussing the reinvention of the institutional set-up.Indian Railways sees substantial private sector involvement in the form of vendors and contractors. Policymakers could start mulling extreme options such as parallel privately-owned and operated railway infrastructure, coupled with centralised planning and an evolved role for the railways. This will need a robust policy framework from the Government of India.The time is perhaps also ripe to bring user charge and asset monetisation-driven segments for passengers as well as cargo to the discussion table. Globally, the separation of infrastructure and operations in railways has delivered mixed results, for example in the United Kingdom. The model should be analysed and revisited to understand its potential relevance in the Indian context.The key would be to retrace our steps and align our long-term goals to identify not just incremental changes but also ways to explore bold and path-breaking alternatives that put Indian Railways on a smooth track and bring it up to speed.","Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore.

Budget 2024 capital gains tax changes: The Narendra Modi government is considering suggestions for tweaks in the new long term capital gains tax regime that was announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman in Union Budget 2024.The July 23 budget reduced the LTCG tax on property from 20% to 12.5%. The indexation benefit, which allowed taxpayers to adjust the acquisition cost for inflation before calculating capital gains and thus reduce their tax liability, is proposed to be eliminated for properties purchased on or after April 1, 2001.The government publishes the Cost Inflation Index (CII) annually for this calculation.India Inc is appealing to the government for a gradual shift to the long-term capital gains tax regime proposed in the FY25 budget, which aims to eliminate indexation benefits for property, gold, and other unlisted assets.According to an ET report by Deepshikha Sikarwar, the industry is suggesting alternatives such as a higher tax rate with indexation or a lower rate of 12.5% without indexation, as well as some form of grandfathering for ancestral properties.The finance ministry is currently reviewing these proposals and will discuss them with the Prime Minister's Office. The final decision will be made closer to the date when the Finance Bill reply is to be presented in Parliament, the reports said.Industry groups are expected to submit formal proposals to the finance ministry in the near future.

Budget 2024 for manufacturing sector : The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth. While the middle class has been offered tax relief, the government's primary focus remains on judicious spending to maximize economic impact. The budget's core themes are employment, skilling, MSME development, and support for the middle class.Largely focus has remained intact on spending money judiciously to ensure that each penny spent creates a ripple effect in the entire economic landscape.Although at first glance, manufacturing might appear to have taken a backseat, a deeper analysis reveals a multifaceted approach to bolstering the sector. Initiatives like employment-linked benefits and internship programs, while primarily aimed at job creation and skill development, indirectly benefit manufacturing companies by expanding the talent pool.Extensive focus on the MSME manufacturing units by way of extending term loan facility for purchase of machinery and equipment without collateral or third-party guarantee, would help companies in augmenting their capital base/ capacity and strengthen the very foundation of the manufacturing ecosystem in the country. Development of a new credit-assessment model by Public Sector Banks to assess MSME credit shall provide much needed regulatory relief to the units.With respect to the large manufacturing entities, while there is no direct fiscal/ tax incentive introduced in this budget, some support has been provided with an extensive focus on development of ‘industrial parks’ in nearly 100 cities under the ‘plug and play’ model. Reforms proposed with respect to land administration, planning and management, shall also ease out acquisition related difficulties often faced by entrepreneurs/ business houses in acquiring lands for manufacturing set-ups.Targeted Customs duty interventions like, rationalization of Customs duty provisions in Mobile phone manufacturing setups, extension of Customs duty exemption on import of capital goods for manufacturing of solar cells and panels, full Customs duty exemption on import of 25 critical minerals,, shall provide the required impetus for enhancing domestic manufacturing environment.Governments’ focus on formulating an Economic Policy Framework to set the scope for next-gen reforms in the country, has a target to improve the productivity of factors of production, namely, land, labour, capital, entrepreneurship and technology. This shall pave the way for enabling achievement of a target of 25% manufacturing sector contribution to the nation’s GDP over the course of next 7-10 years.While the overall outlook is positive, the extension of tax benefits under Section 115BAB for manufacturing entities and the absence of new PLI schemes are notable omissions.The country’s manufacturing base is expanding as is reflective from the continuously increasing tax collections and expanding Purchasing Manager’s Index. It would be pertinent to see how the ground realities evolve vis-à-vis the vision envisaged, in the upcoming Financial Year.","The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth.

Budget 2024: Armed with the vision to propel India to become a developed country by 2047, the Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business thereby providing the required stimulus to the manufacturing sector and enabling large scale job creation.On the Indirect tax front, the industry welcomes the much-needed announcement for a comprehensive review of the rate structure under Customs enabling ease in product classification and dispute reduction. The proposal of lowering of Customs duty on a plethora of raw materials and products including solar cells, critical minerals and bullion are encouraging measures. The rationale behind such reduction clearly indicates support towards domestic manufacturing, deepening value addition and supporting targets in reducing carbon footprint.Relevant amendments under the Customs law have been made to provide increased time limits for re-imports and re-exports to enhance competitiveness of the fledgling MRO sector. The government has extended significant duty reduction and exemption benefits to the healthcare and electronics sectors, continuing the impetus of incentives provided under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme.Since their introduction in March 2020, the PLI schemes have indeed supported in revitalizing the manufacturing sector and strengthening the necessary supply chains. The success achieved in the mobile manufacturing sector has now enabled the Government to reduce customs duties on mobile phones and components, signalling a mature environment. The Budget proposals aim at reproducing similar outcomes for semiconductor and pharmaceutical industry by increasing the budgetary allocation.Buoyed by the increasing revenue collection under GST signalling a shift towards a mature tax regime, this Budget has harmonized the timeframes for the issuance of demand notices and adjudication orders for cases involving fraud, suppression or otherwise. Significant amendments to the GST legislations have been introduced reflecting the recommendations proposed by the GST Council such as regularizing non-levy of GST due to general practice which may turn out to be a breather for certain impacted industries reeling under huge tax demands.The Insurance sector has been provided much relief through the GST council recommendations which have been cemented in the present budget thereby ending long standing disputes on their business practices.The Government's efforts to push forward with its reform agenda are evident as plans to incentivize states for their business reform actions plans and digitalization through the Jan Vishwas Bill 2.0 is proposed. Further, setting up of e-commerce export hubs is envisaged to facilitate easier access to international markets for domestic players.The recent implementation of Budget proposals allows the government to maintain momentum in its reform agenda. These policy measures implicitly reaffirm the significance of India Inc as a crucial element in the development of infrastructure. However, there are still some expectations required to be met to march towards a Viksit Bharat 2047.",The Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business.

Budget 2024 : Real estate, a significant contributor to employment generation, has received a fair bit of attention in Budget 2024-25. Recent years have seen the sector transform rapidly, driven by factors such as favourable government policies, Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, strong economic growth and changing consumer preferences.Added to that, the budgetary focus on job creation, skilling and employment-linked incentives, infrastructure, urban development, rural connectivity, digitalisation and land-related norms, all dovetail to promote growth of the sector.Launched in June 2015, the PMAY aims to provide affordable housing to all eligible beneficiaries. The budget unveiled PMAY Urban 2.0, under which the housing needs of 1 crore urban poor and middle class will be addressed with an investment of Rs 10 lakh crore.The central government’s additional Rs 2.2 lakh crore injection in the next 5 years to make housing more affordable has the potential to revitalise the affordable housing market.Such an approach can play an important role in realising the government's vision of Housing for All and push growth and development. Hence, the significant investment under PMAY Urban 2.0 is expected to alleviate urban housing deficits, spurring construction and economic growth.Steps to introduce technological reforms within the regulatory framework for land, such as digitalisation or GIS mapping of land records, will improve transparency.Rationalisation of stamp duty across states will also be critical to bring in uniformity and initiate land-related reforms such as urban planning, usage and building bylaws.These are steps in the right direction and will boost growth. Moreover, they will improve the ease of property transactions and strengthen municipal finances through increased property taxes. Rationalization of stamp duty with an emphasis on women homebuyers may boost home-buyer sentiment in major cities, too.The budget has also given ample attention to urban and rural development, with rental housing for industrial workers through the public private partnership model, interest subsidies for rental housing, and transit-oriented developments.The proposal to develop investment-ready plug-and-play industrial parks in 100 cities may attract industrial investment, leading to increased demand for industrial real estate and support the growth of ancillary services and residential developments in these regions.Initiatives for industrial parks and rental housing for industrial workers align with the country’s manufacturing goals and addresses worker accommodation needs.These steps are expected to promote industrial growth and stability in labour-intensive sectors, while also creating new opportunities for real estate developers specialising in rental and affordable housing.The changes in long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax, however, have evoked a mixed reaction. The government lowered the long-term capital gains tax from 20% to 12.5%, which is a welcome step. However, this came with the removal of the indexation benefit.The changes could encourage more liquidity in property transactions and potentially increase the effective tax burden depending on the property’s acquisition date.The launch of Phase IV of the PM Gram Sadak Yojana in 25,000 rural habitations will improve connectivity in rural areas, promoting rural development and making these regions more accessible for investment. The primary objective of PMGSY is to build robust, all-weather roads in rural habitations. This initiative focuses on enhancing connectivity and supporting economic development in rural areas.In essence, the budget is geared towards stimulating growth and investment in the real estate sector , fostering a more transparent and investor-friendly environment, and contributing to overall development. It aims to create a balanced and inclusive growth environment by addressing the needs of various segments, including affordable housing, industrial workers and urban infrastructure.The effectiveness of the initiatives, however, hinges on their implementation and continued support of complementary reforms.","Budget 2024-25 is geared towards stimulating growth and investment in the real estate sector.

New Budget 2024 rule: Why Income Tax Department is likely to issue a huge number of tax notices this month,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-budget-2024-rule-why-income-tax-department-is-likely-to-issue-a-huge-number-of-tax-notices-this-month/articleshow/112186079.cms,"Taxing Times

Income Tax Notice on the way? The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month, as there are concerns that many taxpayers might escape the tax net due to the impending implementation of the new reassessment law on September 1, 2024.According to the amended regulation announced in Budget 2024 , the tax authorities can only go back a maximum of five years to reassess a taxpayer's records if the escaped income is at least Rs 50 lakh, and three years for an amount less than Rs 50 lakh.Previously, they could reassess cases up to 10 years old.According to an ET report, tax officials are now faced with the challenge of compiling and corroborating data on tax and income mismatches for the financial years 2013-14 to 2017-18 within the next few weeks, as these years will become time-barred for reassessment from September 1, 2024.The I-T department relies on information from various sources, such as banks, property registrars, and search findings from the investigation wing, to build reassessment cases.A tax officers' body has raised concerns about the feasibility of issuing notices under Section 148 (or 148A) in a large number of cases within a single month, given the overburdened nature of the jurisdictional assessing officers and the time-consuming process of obtaining sanction from the chief commissioner, who is the specified authority for such notices.Moreover, the law provides taxpayers with the right to explain their position before reassessment orders are finalized, a process that most believe cannot be completed by the end of August.Also Read | ITR refund status for FY 2023-24: How to check income tax refund status online - here’s a step-by-step guide for incometax.gov.in & NSDL websites The Central Board of Direct Taxes ( CBDT ) has been urged by its officers to postpone the effective date of the proposed amendment. However, this suggestion is unlikely to be well-received by corporations and high net worth individuals.""Capping the reassessment period at five years was a great decision as it would reduce hassles and litigation. But if the department fears there could be a genuine loss of revenue as it may not be possible to wrap up several matters by August 31, the government can think of strict parameters where time-bound cases can be selectively reopened - based on trails of steps taken in identifying escaped income,"" said Mitil Chokshi, partner at CA firm Chokshi & Chokshi.""Taxpayers may expect a rush of reassessment notices in August 2024. These notices are likely to be for the AYs 2018-19 and prior to that. It is pertinent to note that the Bombay High Court in a recent ruling in a case of Hexaware Technologies has taken a view on a proviso introduced in 2021, which can be interpreted to mean that AY 2017-18 (and prior years) got time barred on March 31, 2024. These reassessment notices (for AYs 2017-18 and prior) are likely to rake up new interpretation issues in the already muddled reassessment provisions,"" said Ashish Mehta, partner at law firm Khaitan & Co.The current situation is similar to the conflict between the Income Tax office and taxpayers in 2021. The reassessment law was amended in April 2021, allowing the tax office to reopen 10-year-old tax returns if the total undisclosed income exceeded Rs 50 lakh and reassess 4-year-old matters if the amount was less than Rs 50 lakh.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? However, this change led to over 10,000 writ petitions being filed by companies, arguing that they were not given sufficient time to explain and that the notices were issued without considering the carve-out that cases which couldn't be reopened earlier couldn't be reassessed under the new law.The Supreme Court invoked its extraordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution on May 4, 2022, to uphold all reassessment notices issued after March 31, 2021. However, the court left room for judicial proceedings based on the merits of each case, and several such matters are currently pending before the court.","The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month.

Are NPS Vatsalya & hiked NPS deduction limit for private sector employees good moves from Budget 2024?

NPS and EPF: Overlapping services

What is NPS Vatsalaya?

Latest NPS rules, news: In the Union Budget 2024 speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced two new initiatives with regard to National Pension Scheme (NPS) - extension of NPS 14% employer contribution benefits to private setcor and the intended launch of NPS Vatsalya.Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries, bringing it at par with the provisions available for government employees.Sriram Iyer, CEO, HDFC Pension Management told ET that with this move the “ground rules have been harmonised among government and non-government employees, which is a positive step.”Effectively, this means that now, private-sector employees can choose to reduce the taxable portion of employers’ contribution to their NPS corpus, thereby paying less tax and leaving greater funds in their pension deposits.“Employees will benefit from tax savings . More importantly, the 40% increase in contribution will have a significant impact on the terminal value of the retirement corpus,” remarked Iyer. The extended savings will “help in retirement planning, working as an option that is at par with the Provident Fund,” Dinesh Rohira, CEO & Founder, 5nance.com was quoted as saying.Moreover, the endeavour aims to increase NPS penetration by increasing tax incentives for the private sector, providing them a social security-cushion post-retirement.The scheme’s motive to widen the NPS subscriber base may not prove to be flawlessly effective, however. This is explained by Agrees Mrin Agarwal, Founder, Finsafe India: “While it’s good that the limit has been raised, it may not increase adoption as employees need to be educated in a big way. Also, the benefit is only for the salaried opting for the new tax regime,” she says.The mandatory contribution to the EPF, too, threatens to relegate the provisions of NPS under the umbrella of near-superfluity. This sentiment is echoed by Varun Sahay, a software engineer in a Delhi-based IT company: “When 12% of my salary is already deducted for the EPF, why should I put in more in the NPS and cut my take-home pay?”Rohira feels otherwise. “There’s no competition between the NPS and EPF as employees can contribute to both and build a 3-4 times bigger corpus while earning 3-4% higher returns via marketlinked options in the NPS,” he counters.Also Check | New Tax Regime 2023 vs 2024 After Budget: How Much Income Tax Will Salaried Taxpayers Save & How Do New Tax Slabs Compare To Old Regime? Top 10 Points You Must Know To jumpstart retirement savings for children, a new initiative called NPS Vatsalya has been unveiled in the Budget. This scheme allows parents and guardians to contribute to a minor's account, which can be converted into a regular NPS account once the child reaches adulthood.""It provides a very long duration for reaping the compounding benefits and accumulating a huge bounty at a later age. This can be a good way to plan a better future for kids who may not opt for a service segment in the future,"" says Rohira. Sriram Iyer agrees, stating, ""It’s a good move to help the child start his retirement journey. Even if a parent starts when the child is 10 years old, by the time he starts working, it can be a solid foundation for the compounding journey after that.""However, some experts question the utility of a product with such a long lock-in period, especially when parents cannot use the funds for essential goals like their child’s education amidst soaring education costs of 11-12%.""Parents are struggling to save for their own retirement, so it might be a bit of a stretch to expect them to save for their kids’ retirement. The need of the hour is a market-linked product that allows withdrawals only for the child’s education,"" says Mrin Agarwal, Founder of Finsafe India.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? Though the NPS permits partial withdrawals, it allows only 25% of the corpus after three years of joining, and this can be done only three times during the entire tenure. A premature exit before 60 years with 100% withdrawal is only possible if the corpus is less than Rs.2.5 lakh, an amount insufficient for most children's goals.""In its current form, there won’t be any uptake,"" asserts Agarwal. Rohira concurs, ""It’s a vanilla product with a lock-in, which does not make it very attractive and it may not take off. However, the government may optimise it and introduce new features later."" Iyer adds, ""This is just a start and there may be more subscriber-friendly features as we take it to the market. The regulator is proactive and open to feedback.""","Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries.

Gold import duty cut: Why Indians may not find buying gold from Dubai as attractive post Budget 2024,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-import-duty-cut-why-indians-may-not-find-buying-gold-from-dubai-as-attractive-post-budget-2024/articleshow/112097671.cms,"Gold import duty cut in Budget 2024: The recent reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai. Indian jewellers with stores in both India and the UAE believe that the narrowed duty differential will result in lower gold prices in India, making it less attractive for Indians to purchase gold in Dubai.The emirate had attracted gold-enthusiast Indians following a steep rise in customs duty in India in July 2022. In the fiscal 2024-25 budget, the duty on gold imports was more than halved.The duty cut is also expected to boost gold jewellery production in India, particularly the popular 'Kolkatti' jewellery from Kolkata, which is favored by Indian expats in Dubai and tourists from various countries. This move will encourage gold artisans to create new designs in both heavyweight and lightweight jewellery, attracting consumers to purchase gold from India.According to an ET report, Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group , estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India as Indian tourists who previously bought jewellery in Dubai will now prefer to shop in India. However, Indian expats living in Dubai and other customers may continue to buy from the UAE.Also Read | Gold losing sheen?

He points out that the labour cost is significantly lower in India, and with the introduction of mandatory hallmarking and HUID numbers, the purity of gold in India is no longer a concern.Furthermore, NRIs in Dubai do not receive VAT refunds, and Indians travelling abroad only receive about 60% of the VAT back on their gold purchases. Gold trade analyst Bhargav Baidya suggests that the 1% duty differential between gold jewellery in India and Dubai will be offset by Indian jewellers offering discounts to retain and attract customers.Saurabh Gadgil, chairman of PNG Jewellers, notes that Indian import duty is now on par with the US, allowing Indian jewellers to offer competitive prices compared to other countries worldwide. The reduced customs duty is expected to make gold purchases in India more attractive and convenient for Indian consumers, potentially leading to a significant shift in their gold shopping preferences.",The reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai.

Gold losing sheen? The government has reduced its target for issuing gold bonds in the financial year 2024-25 by 38% compared to the previous interim budget goal, according to a senior official. The revised target stands at Rs 18,500 crore, down from Rs 29,638 crore estimated in the interim budget and Rs 26,852 crore (revised estimate) in 2023-24.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told ET ""The decision followed a reassessment of various factors, including investor demand, other investment products and uncertainties around the global economy, as the situation has changed since the interim budget in February.""After accounting for redemptions, the net issuances of sovereign gold bonds are now estimated at Rs 15,000 crore for this fiscal year, a significant decrease from the Rs 26,138 crore projected in the interim budget and Rs 25,352 crore in the revised estimate for 2023-24.Harish Galipelli, director at ILA Commodities India, attributed this shift to retail investors increasingly opting for equities in anticipation of better returns. He also noted that people are uncertain about the potential for further increases in gold prices in the short-to-medium term following a recent rally. Additionally, Galipelli pointed out that savings in rural areas have been impacted by retail inflation and other factors.The gold bond and gold monetisation schemes were introduced by the government in late 2015 to discourage the physical purchase of precious metals and reduce imports, thereby mitigating the negative impact on the current account deficit.The gross collection through these two schemes is now projected to be Rs 20,030 crore in 2024-25, compared to Rs 31,168 crore in the interim budget and Rs 28,240 crore (revised estimate) in the previous fiscal year. Similarly, the net collection is estimated at Rs 16,433 crore, down from Rs 27,571 crore in the interim budget and Rs 26,653 crore in the previous year.

NEW DELHI: The four co-owners of the Old Rajinder Nagar basement coaching centre have approached the Delhi high court seeking bail after their previous application was rejected by the trial court.The trial court denied bail on Friday, to the four co-owners of the coaching centre basement in Old Rajinder Nagar, where three IAS aspirants drowned on July 27, 2024.The court noted that the liability of the co-owners stemmed from their illegal act of allowing the basement to be used as a coaching institute.In their fresh bail plea filed with the Delhi high court, the co-owners argued that the trial court overlooked the fact that they were not named in the FIR. They also emphasized their voluntary appearance at the police station and cooperation with the investigation, despite not being summoned by the investigating officer, as evidence of their good faith.The plea further asserts that the trial court disregarded the principle that vicarious liability is not applicable in criminal law. The co-owners maintain that strict criminal liability applies only to the individual who directly commits the criminal act, which they believe does not apply to them in this case.During their previous bail application, the accused claimed that the tragic incident was caused by heavy rain, which they referred to as an ""act of God."" They also placed some of the blame on the civic agency responsible for the area's malfunctioning sewer system.The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), which is handling the case, informed the trial court that the basement was intended solely for storage and not for educational purposes. The agency alleges that the accused were aware of the dangers associated with operating a coaching centre in that location.The court also took into account the testimony of a Karol Bagh resident who had previously expressed concerns about Rau's IAS conducting classes in the basement without proper authorization. The resident had cautioned about the possibility of a major accident a month before the incident occurred.The court concluded that the accused were aware that permitting the illegal use of the basement was putting lives at risk and that this unlawful use was directly linked to the tragic incident.","The trial court denied bail on Friday, to the four co-owners of the coaching centre basement in Old Rajinder Nagar, where three IAS aspirants drowned on July 27, 2024. The court noted that the liability of the co- Owners stemmed from their illegal act of allowing the basement to be used as a coaching institute.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112857994,imgsize-44238,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/112857994.jpg"
Nvidia tumbles after disappointing forecast,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/nvidia-tumbles-after-disappointing-forecast/articleshow/112881809.cms,"Nvidia Corp failed to live up to investor hopes with its latest results on Wednesday, delivering an underwhelming forecast and news of production snags with its much-awaited Blackwell chips.The company’s quarterly report — the most anticipated part of the tech industry’s earnings season — met or beat analysts’ estimates on nearly every measure. But Nvidia investors have grown accustomed to blowout quarters, and the latest numbers didn’t qualify.Moreover, Nvidia’s next big cash cow — the new Blackwell processor lineup — has proven more challenging to manufacture than anticipated. The product is the next generation of the company’s dominant artificial intelligence processor, and fears of delays contributed to a stock decline of as much as 8.4% in late trading. The shares had more than doubled this year through Wednesday’s close, following a gain of 239% in 2023.“It was up against lofty and unsustainable expectations,” Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Kunjan Sobhani and Oscar Hernandez Tejada said in a note.Third-quarter revenue will be about $32.5 billion, the company said. Though analysts had predicted $31.9 billion on average, estimates ranged as high as $37.9 billion.The disappointing outlook threatens to tamp down an AI frenzy that has transformed Nvidia into the world’s second-most-valuable company. The chipmaker is the key beneficiary of a race to upgrade data centers to handle AI software, and its sales forecasts have become a barometer for that spending boom.Heading into the announcement, there was concern that Nvidia was having problems with its new Blackwell design. The company acknowledged that there were issues with production, saying that it was making changes to improve its manufacturing yield — the number of functioning chips that come out of factories. At the same time, the company said it expects to bring in “several billion dollars” of revenue in the fourth quarter from the product.Supplies will be plentiful after manufacturing gains momentum, Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang said later during a Bloomberg Television interview. “We’re going to have lots and lots of supply, and we will be able to ramp,” he said.Nvidia is coming off a string of quarters that shattered Wall Street expectations — even as analysts continued to raise estimates. But the amount of upside has been trending down.Most of Nvidia’s growth also has come from a small group of customers. About 40% of Nvidia’s revenue stems from large data-center operators — companies like Alphabet Inc’s Google and Meta Platforms Inc — which are pouring tens of billions of dollars into AI infrastructure.Though Meta and others have increased their capital expenditure budgets this earnings season, there’s been concern that the amount of infrastructure being put in place exceeds current requirements. That could lead to a bubble. But Nvidia’s Huang has maintained that this is only the beginning of a new era for technology and the economy.Expectations were lofty. Nvidia has been the best performing stock in the S&P 500 Index this year, eclipsing gains by all other semiconductor companies. At a market value of more than $3 trillion, Nvidia is worth roughly the same amount as the next 10 largest chip firms combined.Nvidia made its name by selling video-game cards, but is now best known for so-called AI accelerators. These chips, derived from its graphics processors, are used to develop artificial intelligence software by bombarding it with information.The process, known as training, makes AI models better at recognizing and responding to real-world inputs. Nvidia’s components are also used in systems that then run the software, a stage known as inference, and help power services such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT .Last quarter’s results topped Wall Street projections, and the Santa Clara, California-based company’s board approved an additional $50 billion in stock buybacks.Nvidia’s revenue more than doubled to $30 billion in the fiscal second quarter, which ended July 28. Excluding certain items, profit was 68 cents a share. Analysts had predicted sales of about $28.9 billion and earnings of 64 cents a share.Nvidia got a jump on other chipmakers because its technology was well-suited to the needs of AI. But rivals are trying to catch up. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. is now its closest competitor, with Intel Corp. — once the world’s biggest chipmaker — trailing further behind. Their combined revenue from the market is only about 5% of Nvidia’s total.Nvidia’s data-center division — now by far its largest source of sales — generated $26.3 billion of revenue last quarter. Gaming chips provided $2.9 billion. Analysts had given targets of $25.1 billion for the data-center unit and $2.79 billion for gaming.Blackwell is expected to generate a fresh wave of growth when it rolls out in the coming months. Analysts have downplayed concerns about delays, noting that the company still enjoys huge demand for its current generation of products. That could help Nvidia cope with any delays without a big financial hit.In describing its challenges with Blackwell, Nvidia said it had to change a mask production step to improve its yield. A mask is the template used to burn the circuit pattern into materials deposited on a disk of silicon.Production of Blackwell is set to ramp up in the fourth quarter and continue into the next fiscal year, Nvidia said.During a post-results conference call, analysts sought more details on the amount of revenue that the new Blackwell chips would deliver and when. Huang and Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress stuck to their promise of billions of dollars in the fourth quarter, refusing to elaborate further.The stock extended its declines as the call went on and answers weren’t provided.In his typical fashion, Huang made high-level predictions on the future of the computing industry, arguing that a trillion dollars of equipment will be needed to replace outmoded gear in the world’s data centers. That replacement process is just beginning, he said.AI is taking over computer search, helping companies speed up their business processes, and needed by countries to secure data, he said.“It’s affecting how every layer of computing is done,” Huang said.",N Nvidia Corp delivered an underwhelming forecast and news of production snags with its much-awaited Blackwell chips. Fears of delays contributed to a stock decline of as much as 8.4% in late trading. The disappointing outlook threatens to tamp down an AI frenzy that has transformed Nvidia.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112881799,imgsize-181144,width-400,resizemode-4/112881799.jpg"

BELLINZONA: A top Swiss court sentenced two PetroSaudi executives to jail terms on Wednesday after finding them guilty over the embezzlement of USD 1.8 billion from the Malaysian sovereign wealth fund 1MDB .Tarek Obaid, the Swiss-Saudi chief executive of the oil exploration and production company, was sentenced to seven years in prison by the Federal Criminal Court, Switzerland's Keystone-ATS news agency reported.Patrick Mahony, a Swiss-British director at PetroSaudi, was given a six-year sentence, the agency said.Prosecutor Alice de Chambrier had sought a 10-year sentence for Obaid and a nine-year term for his right-hand man.Obaid, 48, and Mahony, 47, were seen arriving separately at the court in the southern city of Bellinzona ahead of the verdict hearing.The trial was heard by three judges at the court in April.Obaid and Mahony were accused of involvement in a vast embezzlement orchestrated by Jho Low, an advisor to former Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak.Noting the sums involved compared to Malaysia's GDP, Chambrier called it the ""scam of the century"" and branded the defendants as ""calculative, manipulative and obscenely greedy"", Keystone-ATS reported during the trial.The defence pleaded for acquittal, arguing that no fraud had taken place.According to the original indictment, ""the two accused are alleged, with the aim of enriching themselves and others, to have misappropriated at least USD 1.8 billion"", transferred by 1MDB in connection with a joint venture with PetroSaudi, ""and then to have laundered the amounts involved"".""The allegations cover a period at least from 2009 to 2015 and constitute the offences of fraud on a commercial basis, aggravated criminal mismanagement, and aggravated money laundering.""The indictment said the defendants ""used money misappropriated from 1MDB"" to acquire real estate in Switzerland and in London, jewellery and private equity.They were also accused of using the money ""to develop PetroSaudi activities from which they received substantial income, and to maintain a lavish lifestyle"".The multi-billion-dollar 1MDB financial scandal has led to criminal investigations around the world, including in the United States, Switzerland and Singapore.It is alleged that billions of dollars were pilfered from the 1Malaysia Development Berhad fund by a number of people and used to buy items ranging from artwork to a superyacht.The 1MDB scandal led to the fall of Najib's government in 2018.In 2022, the former prime minister was sentenced to 12 years in jail in Malaysia for offences linked to the misuse of public money. In February, his sentence was halved to six years.During the Swiss trial , Chambrier said Obaid and Mahony squandered their loot on precious stones, private jets, rented yachts and property in London and Geneva.She accused them of ""extraordinary criminal activity and tenacity"" over 10 years between 2009 and 2019, if alleged acts of concealment are included, Keystone-ATS reported.The defence lawyers tried to set out the context of relations between PetroSaudi and 1MDB.Nicolas Rouiller said the Swiss attorney-general's office had ""adopted a radically wrong approach"", ignoring the nature of Saudi Arabia's absolute monarchy.He said individuals, especially those belonging to very high-ranking families like Obaid, were not free in their actions.As for the use of an Islamic loan, Rouiller said it was a common practice in Muslim countries and could not therefore be seen as a dishonest manoeuvre aimed at cheating 1MDB.""There is no injury in this operation. This is exactly what is wanted"" by the partners, he said.Lawyer Daniel Zappelli said several allegations had been dropped by the prosecution, highlighted the absence of Najib and Low and said there were variations in the amounts that the defendants allegedly laundered, Keystone-ATS reported.The defence also said Riyadh and Kuala Lumpur wanted to strengthen relations following Najib's election in 2009 and claimed the Malaysians wanted a joint venture between 1MDB and PetroSaudi wrapped up quickly.","Tarek Obaid, the Swiss-Saudi chief executive of the oil exploration and production company, was sentenced to seven years in prison.

The US this year accused Volt Typhoon of infiltrating networks that operate critical US services, including some of the country’s water facilities, power grid and communications sectors, in order to cause disruptions during a future crisis, such as an invasion of Taiwan.Liu Pengyu, a spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, said in an email, “ ‘Volt Typhoon’ is actually a ransomware cyber criminal group who calls itself the ‘Dark Power’ and is not sponsored by any state or region.”He added that China sees signs that the US intelligence community has secretly collaborated with cybersecurity companies to falsely accuse China of supporting cyberattacks against the US as part of an effort to boost congressional budgets and government contracts. Bloomberg couldn’t verify those claims.Lumen shared its findings with Versa in late June, according to Lumen and supporting documentation shared with Bloomberg.Versa, which is based in Santa Clara, California, said it issued an emergency patch for the bug at the end of June, but only began flagging the issue widely to customers in July once it was notified by one that claimed to have been breached. Versa said that customer, which it didn’t identify, didn’t follow previously published guidelines on how to protect its systems via firewall rules and other measures.Dan Maier, Versa’s chief marketing officer, said in an email Monday that those 2015 guidelines include advising customers to close off internet access to a specific port, which the customer had failed to follow. Since last year, he said, Versa has now taken measures of its own to make the system “secure by default,” meaning customers will no longer be exposed to that risk even if they haven’t followed company guidelines.The bug carries a “high” severity rating, according to the National Vulnerability Database. On Friday, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, known as CISA, ordered federal agencies to patch Versa products or stop using them by Sept. 13.The vulnerability has been exploited in at least one known instance by a sophisticated hacking group, Versa said in a blog post on Monday. The company didn’t identify the group, and on Friday, Versa told Bloomberg it didn’t know the identity.Microsoft Corp named and unveiled the Volt Typhoon campaign in May 2023. Since its discovery, US officials have urged companies and utilities to improve their logging to help search for and eradicate the hackers, who use vulnerabilities to get into systems and then can remain undetected for long stretches of time.The Chinese government has dismissed US accusations, saying the hacking attacks attributed to Volt Typhoon are the work of cyber criminals.CISA Director Jen Easterly told Congress in January about the malicious cyber activity, warning the US has discovered only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to victims and that China’s aim is to be able to plunge the US into “societal panic.”US agencies, including CISA, the National Security Agency and the FBI, said in February that Volt Typhoon activity dates back at least five years and has targeted communications, energy, transportation systems, water and wastewater systems.Lumen first identified the malicious code in June, according to Lumen researcher Michael Horka. A malware sample uploaded from Singapore on June 7 bore the hallmarks of Volt Typhoon, he said in an interview.Horka, a former FBI cyber investigator who joined Lumen in 2023 after working on Volt Typhoon cases for the federal government, said the code was a web shell that allowed hackers to gain access to a customer’s network via legitimate credentials and then behave as if they were bona fide users.","Volt Typhoon has breached four US firms, including internet service providers, and another in India through a vulnerability in a Versa Networks server product.

Several Indian-origin CEOs are at the helm of big tech companies, a list that has grown over the years.Kevan Parekh, who has been with Apple for 11 years, currently oversees financial planning and analysis, benefits finance, investor relations and market research. Previously, he managed the financial support for worldwide sales, retail and marketing finance, as well as product marketing, internet sales and services and engineering teams. He will join the company’s executive leadership team and report directly to CEO Tim Cook.“For more than a decade, Kevan has been an indispensable member of Apple’s finance leadership team, and he understands the company inside and out. His sharp intellect, wise judgment, and financial brilliance make him the perfect choice to be Apple’s next CFO,” Cook said in a statement.Prior to his career at Apple, Parekh held various senior leadership positions at Thomson Reuters and General Motors. An alumnus of the University of Michigan and an MBA from the University of Chicago, Parekh has a strong educational background.A Bloomberg report said Maestri has been grooming Parekh for the CFO role for several months. “I’m looking forward to the next stage of my time at Apple, and I have enormous confidence in Kevan as he prepares to take over the reins as CFO. He is truly exceptional, has a deep love for Apple and its mission, and he embodies the leadership, judgment and values that are so important to this role,” Maestri said.The rise of Indian-origin leaders within Apple’s ecosystem has been significant. With India becoming a bright spot for Apple, the C-suite presence of leaders of Indian descent has added more firepower to its leadership. A recent Bloomberg report said that Apple COO Jeff Williams’ deputy, Sabih Khan, is likely going to replace him. Khan, a 24-year Apple veteran, was named to the company’s executive team as senior vice-president of operations in 2019.The report also said that if Khan is promoted, “Priya Balasubramaniam is a near-lock to be Apple’s next senior vice-president of operations — and probably, one day, a future Apple COO”. A 23-year Apple veteran, Balasubramaniam has risen through the ranks to become vice president of operations in 2014.","Parekh, who is currently VP (financial planning and analysis), will become CFO & join the executive team.
