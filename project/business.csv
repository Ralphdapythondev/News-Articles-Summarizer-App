Microsoft-backed cloud platform ‘will bully Indians to agree with it’: Ola CEO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/microsoft-backed-cloud-platform-will-bully-indians-to-agree-with-it-ola-ceo/articleshow/110042838.cms,"BENGALURU: Ola founder and CEO Bhavish Aggarwal said that the company will move its workloads to its own cloud platform , Krutrim, as it plans to exit Microsoft 's Azure within a week.Ola has been a customer of Microsoft since 2017.""Since LinkedIn is owned by Microsoft and Ola is a significant customer of Azure, we've decided to move our entire workload out of Azure to our own @Krutrim cloud within the next week.It is a challenge, as all developers know, but my team is very excited about undertaking this. Any other developer who wants to move out of Azure, we will offer a full year of free cloud usage, as long as you don't return to Azure after that!"" he wrote on X and in a blog post on Ola.Krutrim, the AI unicorn founded by Aggarwal, has also opened up its cloud platform to enterprises, researchers, and developers for access to AI computing infrastructure, Krutrim's foundational models, and open-source models hosted on its platform. In January, Krutrim raised $50 million in a funding round led by Matrix Partners India. Aggarwal said the funding was at a valuation of over $1 billion. This makes it perhaps India's first unicorn in the pure AI space.Aggarwal's decision to leave Azure was triggered by a recent post on LinkedIn, where he criticized the use of the pronoun 'they' as an ""illness."" LinkedIn removed the post for violating its professional community policies. Aggarwal expressed his belief that the pronoun issue represents a ""woke political ideology of entitlement"" that does not belong in India. ""I wouldn't have entered this debate, but LinkedIn has assumed that Indians need to adopt pronouns in our lives, and that we can't criticize it. They will bully us into agreeing with them or cancel us. And if they can do this to me, I'm sure the average user stands no chance. As a founder and CEO, this western DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion) system significantly impacts my business as it fosters an entitlement mindset in our professional lives, and I will fight it,"" he wrote on X.Aggarwal emphasized the importance of Indian tech platforms , expressing his concern that his life would be governed by western Big Tech monopolies, leading to cultural subsumption. He clarified that his stance is not against global tech companies, but rather against the imposition of forced ideology as a free-thinking Indian.To address this concern, Ola plans to collaborate with the Indian developer community to create a social media framework based on ONDC and UPI. ""The only 'community guidelines' should be Indian law. No corporate entity should be able to decide what will be banned. Data should be owned by the creators instead of being owned by corporations who profit from our data and then lecture us on 'community guidelines,'"" he wrote on X.","Ola founder and CEO Bhavish Aggarwal said that the company will move its workloads to its own cloud platform, Krutrim.

Khosla fought the case up to the US Supreme Court, which declined to hear his appeal of a lower-court ruling in favor of the Surfrider Foundation in 2018.According to Bloomberg, in the tentative ruling on Friday, Superior Court Judge Raymond Swope said that state officials had provided sufficient evidence to support their claim of public access, allowing the case they filed in 2020 to proceed. The State Lands Commission is seeking a court order to prevent Khosla from blocking the road to the beach, arguing that the public ""has acquired access rights"" to the land based on historical use and California law.At a hearing scheduled for Monday in Redwood City, Khosla has the opportunity to request the judge to reconsider his ruling.",Indian American venture capitalist Vinod Khosla faced another setback in his 15-year battle to restrict public access to a well-known surfing spot south of San Francisco.

The metro ridership has fallen to 4.6 lakh people a day from 5.5 lakh in Nov 2023.The state introduced the free bus ride scheme for women on Dec 9, 2023.For the project to be viable, the metro's ridership should remain at over 5 lakh per day and its debt should come down to Rs 8,000 crore from Rs 12,000 crore.L&T, which bagged the project in 2010, experienced costs rising to Rs 20,000 crore from an estimated Rs 14,000 crore due to multiple delays that saw the 69km line getting completed in 2020. Though some parties had shown an interest in Hyderabad Metro, L&T, which has a 65-year concession to run the project, didn't go ahead with the sale as the price quoted didn't meet its expectations.While L&T praised the Congress-led Telangana govt's initiative, it said the scheme has made metro ridership ""less interesting"" and will look to exit the project after 2026. The engineering giant owns 90% in Hyderabad Metro, while the Telangana govt owns the remaining 10%.""There is a gender distribution that is happening in the transportation system. Buses are being used by women who pay nothing and the metro is used by men who pay Rs 35 on an average per ticket,"" L&T's CFO Shankar Raman was quoted as saying to Business Today TV. He added that govt's move would not help the state's finances.""Our assessment is that when we sit down for the FY26 to FY31 plan, this could be an asset to be monetised in that period,"" he said.","Telangana govt's free bus ride scheme for women has impacted Hyderabad Metro Rail's ridership.

"India to sign 10-year Chabahar port pact with Iran today; move to help counter Pakistan’s Gwadar port, China’s BRI",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/india-to-sign-10-year-chabahar-port-pact-with-iran-today-move-to-help-counter-pakistans-gwadar-port-chinas-bri/articleshow/110066576.cms,"Chabahar port pact

India’s Chabahar port pact to counter Pakistan , China: India is poised to enter into an agreement with Iran for the management of Chabahar Port for the next decade. This move, taking place amidst a busy election season, is seen as a significant geopolitical outreach to Iran with major regional implications.Reliable sources were quoted in an ET report by Dipanjan Roy Chaudhury that shipping minister Sarbananda Sonowal is scheduled to visit Iran on Monday for the signing ceremony.This marks the first instance of India taking over the management of an overseas port.Chabahar Port is viewed as India's crucial connectivity link to Afghanistan, Central Asia, and the broader Eurasian region, serving as a counterbalance to Pakistan's Gwadar port and China's Belt and Road Initiative . Plans are in place to connect Chabahar with the International North South Transport Corridor (INSTC), which links India with Russia via Iran, enabling India to bypass Pakistan and access Afghanistan and ultimately Central Asia.In April, the MEA approved a proposal by India Ports Global to assume operations at Myanmar's Sittwe Port in the Bay of Bengal. Experts noted that Sonowal's travel during a critical poll campaign underscores the significance of the agreement, which has been in the works for several years.The pact will allow India to operate the port, the expansion of which it has financed. The timing of the visit is also noteworthy, as it occurs in the midst of the West Asia crisis, which has affected key trade routes.Chabahar featured prominently in discussions between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Iranian President last year at the BRICS summit in South Africa in August, and later in November, when they spoke over the phone regarding the Gaza crisis.A pact on Chabahar was signed in 2016 during Modi's visit to Iran. In 2018, when Hassan Rouhani, then Iran president, visited India, the issue of expanding India's role at the port was a key topic of discussion. It also arose when foreign minister S Jaishankar visited Tehran in January 2024.Also Read | Indian saffron rules: Kesar selling at Rs 4.95 lakh a kg in retail - the price of nearly 70 grams of gold! The new long-term agreement aims to replace the original contract. The new agreement will have a validity of 10 years and will be automatically extended. The original pact only covers operations at the Shahid Beheshti terminal of Chabahar Port and is renewed annually.In May 2016, India signed a tripartite agreement with Iran and Afghanistan to develop the Shahid Beheshti terminal. Resource-rich but landlocked Central Asian states such as Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan have expressed keen interest in utilizing Chabahar to access the Indian Ocean Region and the Indian market. The port will also be beneficial for Indian traders and investors interested in Central Asia.Pakistan has been attempting to persuade the Central Asian states to use Karachi port for access to the Indian Ocean Region. However, India has been indicating to the Central Asian countries that Chabahar will be a more attractive proposition. Armenia is also eager to connect to the Chabahar port through the INSTC.","India is poised to enter into an agreement with Iran for the management of Chabahar Port for the next decade.

"Hair, groundnut oil exports see surprise surge",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/hair-groundnut-oil-exports-see-surprise-surge/articleshow/110062126.cms,"NEW DELHI: Since Covid in 2020, govt has sought to tap into the China Plus One strategy for global giants and courted companies such as Apple and Samsung to make in India. While the focus has been on bolstering the export of smartphones and other value-added products, Indian exports have seen much faster growth in some other segments, which are not necessarily high-end.For instance, the export of unworked human hair has soared from $34.5 million in 2018-19 (the pre-Covid year) to almost $180 million last year - a jump of over five times - albeit on a smaller base. Similarly, certain types of copper wire exports (with a maximum cross-section diameter of more than 6mm) surged from $76 million to $867 million - an 11-fold rise. Groundnut oil exports went up from almost zero in 2018-19 to $217 million last year, data collated by think tank GTRI showed.Smartphones exports, of course, went up almost 10 times from $1.6 billion in FY19 to $15.5 billion in FY24, which GTRI attributed to ""positive policy interventions"". A separate analysis by the commerce department showed that during the year-ended March 2024, Turkey saw the highest increase in electronics goods exports, rising 147%, followed by the US (75%) and the UK (30%). During the last financial year, electronics goods exports went up 23.6% to over $29 billion, driven by smartphones. Only iron ore saw a higher increase, more than doubling to $3.9 billion in FY24 compared to $1.8 billion as export curbs were eased.And, during the last five years, parboiled rice exports have more than doubled from $1.5 billion in FY19 to $3.3 billion last fiscal, and in this case, the base was not so small. Anti-cancer drugs have seen exports jump from $571 million to over $1.5 billion, rising nearly three times. Among traditional exports, small cars didn't fair badly either with exports rising 43% from $3 billion in FY19 to close to $4.3 billion last year.The bad news is in some of the traditional segments. For instance, cut and polished diamonds, where the value of shipments fell by a third to $23.7 billion during these five years. Similarly, in the case of cotton T-shirts, exports were 15% lower at $1.6 billion, while leather fell 11% to $2.5 billion.","Since Covid in 2020, govt has sought to tap into the China Plus One strategy for global giants.

Exports may grow 10-15% to $900bn in FY25,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/exports-may-grow-10-15-to-900bn-in-fy25/articleshow/110062053.cms,"NEW DELHI: Despite headwinds, Indian exporters are looking at a 10-15% increase in goods exports , with some estimating overall exports to touch $900 billion this year, compared with around $780 billion during the last financial year.In fact, exporters and govt were eyeing $900 billion exports last year as well, but weak demand in the developed market and a fall in commodity prices meant that goods exports fell 3% to $437 billion, while services exports rose 5% to $341 billion, according to commerce department's estimates.Federation of Indian Export Organisations , the umbrella lobby group representing exporters, has estimated that during the current financial year, goods exports will rise to $500-510 billion while services exports will go up to $390-400 billion.Healthy goods exports will also bolster industrial production and overall economic activity .""Despite a very challenging geopolitical and consequent logistics disruptions and freight hikes, the demand for technology-driven products and services are very high and even for lifestyle goods, it is picking up, particularly from advanced economies assuring us for a much better performance this fiscal,"" Fieo DG Ajay Sahai told TOI. Healthy goods exports will also bolster industrial production and overall economic activity.There are, however, some concerns of a slowdown in services due to IT and IT-enabled services, given that growth moderated to a three-year low in 2023-24. While policymakers are looking to diversify beyond IT, telecom and business services, to newer segments such as tourism and healthcare, there is a demand for restoring the scheme to ensure that refunds taxes. Besides, executives at the Services Exports Promotion Council said there was a need for a stronger brand development in case of healthcare and tourism, where India was facing competition from countries that were seeing much higher footfalls.On the goods side, exporters appear more confident and are putting in place a strategy to move away from traditional markets.Garment exporters, for instance, are looking to tap into markets such as Mexico, Brazil, Poland and other east European countries as it seeks to diversify away from the US and Europe, its traditional focus areas, said Apparel Export Promotion Council chairman Sudhir Sekhri.""We are putting emphasis on diversification as we expect it to pay dividends in the coming years, if not this year,"" he said. AEPC is looking at a growth of around 10% to $16 billion, banking on a faster pick-up in the US and the signing of the much-awaited free trade agreement with the UK. ""We are hoping that the Red Sea crisis will end and a change in the interest rate stance in developed countries will boost demand. There is good demand for more value-added products but demand for products at the lower and middle-end has been hit due to reduced purchasing power (due to inflation and higher interest rates in the West),"" Sekhri told TOI.Engineering exporters expect a 15% rise this year. ""Demand in Europe is coming back, there is an improvement. Plus, there is good demand from countries such as the UAE and Australia, with which India has signed trade agreements. We are also seeing good traction in Gulf countries and FTAs with Oman, the UK and Chile will provide a further boost,"" said EEPC India chairman Arun Kumar Garodia.During the last financial year, engineering exports rose 2.1% to $ 109.3 billion and this year, the removal of restrictions on steel exports is expected to provide a thrust.Similarly, Pharma Export Promotion Council's Dinesh Dua is budgeting for a minimum growth of at least 10% to close the current fiscal year with $31-32 billion on strong demand from the US. Besides, he sees demand coming from Africa and Latin America and dismisses concerns over quality issues. ""The problems have been associated with some of the smaller players and Steps taken by govt and some of the industry bodies will ensure that pharma exports maintain the quality that India is known for,"" he said.","Despite headwinds, Indian exporters are looking at a 10-15% increase in goods exports.

The finance minister set the stage for a ""Viksit Bharat by 2047"", on the core principles of ‘Sabka Saath’, ‘Sabka Vikas’, ‘Sabka Vishwas’, with ‘Sabka Prayas’ being added as a new theme in the interim Budget.This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data i.e., farmer welfare and N for Nari utthan i.e., support for women entrepreneurs.These form the pillars of a comprehensive inclusive development. The Government's commitment to sustainable development under the strategy for Amrit Kaal includes achieving 'Net Zero' by 2070, rooftop solarization for one crore households and robust health initiatives.The Indian economy's resilience takes center stage amidst positive indicators of declining current account deficit as a percentage of GDP, falling unemployment rates, and a notable rise in digital transactions. These statistics affirm the robustness of the economy, showcasing a trajectory of growth and stability.The achievements in taxation reforms are nothing short of remarkable, with direct tax collections more than trebling in the last decade, the number of tax return filers increasing by 2.4 times, average processing time of tax returns plummeting from 93 days in FY 2013-14 to an impressive 10 days in FY 2023-24, resulting in issuance of quick refunds. These are the results of consistent progressive measures thus obviating the need for, and rightly avoiding, any last-minute populist measures.No change in existing tax rates, both for direct and indirect taxes, is a good indicator of stability and predictability for investors and taxpayers.A welcome move to waive outstanding tax demands that are minor, disputed, and unreconciled. This involves the withdrawal of outstanding direct tax demands up to Rs. 25,000 pertaining to the period up to FY 2009-10 and up to Rs.10,000 for FY 2010-11 to 2014-15.The Government's commitment to fostering a business-friendly environment is evident in its intent to extend specific tax benefits for start-ups, investments by sovereign wealth funds/ pension funds, and certain IFSC units. The extension has been made now until March 31, 2025. This might help in creating a conducive landscape for business.To align with the CBDT notification issued earlier, the provisions relating to tax collection at source concerning remittances under the Liberalized Remittance Scheme have now been formally incorporated in the Finance Bill, 2024, setting the rate at 20% for amounts exceeding Rs. 7 lakhs in a financial year.The Finance Bill, 2024 proposes an extension of the time limit for introducing the faceless scheme by the Central Government for transfer pricing proceedings, DRP Proceedings, and ITAT Proceedings, up to March 31, 2025.The interim Budget 2024 may not have proposed significant tax announcements, but it very well positioned the prelude to the full budget post the upcoming elections. Considering the potential impact on the population across the four pillars of GYAN, a sizable portion of India stands to be covered. The interim Budget’s focus on the tax front resembles a report card, highlighting the maturity achieved by our tax system. The enhancement of taxpayer services was emphasized as a key priority.","This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data and N for Nari utthan.

Interim Budget for a Viksit Bharat: It’s for everyone and all,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/interim-budget-for-a-viksit-bharat-its-for-everyone-and-all/articleshow/107497439.cms,"By Akhilesh Tuteja

The Finance Minister on February 01, 2024, delivered a truly innovative interim budget. At first glance, it did not seem like an interim budget but looked more like the budget to drive further growth and a continuum of inclusive growth-oriented investments.At the outset, this budget brings a wonderful balance between fiscal prudence and continued investment for growth.It's not easy to continue the glide path of reducing the fiscal deficit and continuing to make significant investments in all areas including infrastructure, R&D, energy transition, technology, skilling, and social welfare. The surprising reduction in fiscal deficit of 5.8% as against the budgeted 5.9% for FY24 and the projection of 5.1% in FY25 with a clear focus on increasing investments was a huge positive.This was a budget for everyone and all because it caters to every part of the Indian economy and society. The FM has carefully catered to the investment needs of various sectors. The continued focus on youth, impoverished, women and farmers to increase their involvement and contribution to economic growth is evident. By committing an 11.1% increase in capital expenditure to 11,11,111 lakh crore, the FM has clearly brought every single 1 in this growth journey.What was very impressive was the inclusion strategy of the government. The focus on women's empowerment for the past few years is unprecedented, which is reflected in the inclusion of women in the workforce moving from 23.3% to 37% in the last five years. The thirty crore Mudra Yojna loans to women entrepreneurs were a great boost to the Nari Shakti initiative. We already have over 10 million Lakhpati Didis and what is truly evident is like a corporate CFO, the FM has revised the earlier target of 20 million Lakhpati Didis to 30 million. The government also plans to invest in initiatives to encourage young girls between the ages of 9 and 14 to undertake the vaccination for cervical cancer which is again a great boost to Nari Shakti.A lot needs to be done to bring more women into all parts of economic growth but the journey so far and the vision of the future is truly inspiring.While India continues on its technological prowess and makes its mark in new technologies like Artificial Intelligence, we need a multi-pronged strategy to harness the power of AI. We need a clear focus on building AI systems in India so that we not only emerge as a global leader in this new era but can build models, which are specific to India that will benefit Indians. At the same time, we need a very wide coverage program to build skills to leverage AI to its fullest potential. The biggest contribution we can make to the inclusion of youth in the economic development of the country is by skilling them in new skill areas. In the last few years, the Skill India Mission has trained 14 million youth, reskilled over 5 million youth and established a staggering 3,000 new ITIs. The future of any country will depend as much on capital investments as on skill investments.The focus on agricultural development and support to the farmer continues through direct financial assistance to farmers. The farmers have benefited by getting crop insurance through PM Fasal Bima Yojana. It's not just the farmers, the PM-SVANidhi provides credit assistance to a large number of street vendors.The last few years have seen the journey of affordable housing through Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY). There is a slight increase in allocation to launch a scheme for encouraging the middle class to build or buy new homes. This investment will likely propel a wider economic development and increase employment.India has seen a tremendous rise in entrepreneurship in the last few years. In order to continue the journey and promote new startups, the government proposes to extend certain tax benefits, which are expiring from March 2024 to March 2025. The MSMEs have not been left behind. With a proposal to provide timely finances to such enterprises, the government has paved the way for their growth, so they can look to compete globally.All in all, it’s a truly inclusive budget with a clear focus on development not just by giving away freebies but enabling the people to participate in the economic development activity. While the FM calls the comprehensive GDP - Governance, Development & Performance – to me, this budget is inclusive of another GDP – gender, demography, and professions.","Akhilesh Tuteja is Partner and Head, Clients and Markets, KPMG in India.

‘Enough domestic sources of demand to counter drag from external sector’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/enough-domestic-sources-of-demand-to-counter-drag-from-external-sector/articleshow/107372012.cms,"Do you think the

creates room for lower interest rates?

One of the issues that the Budget has flagged is the demographic challenge and opportunity and the societal change that is taking place. How do you view this?

Niti Aayog is working on the Viksit Bharat roadmap. What will be the focus areas?

You are as much a representative of the Centre as well as the states. Is it time to revisit the entire formula for transfers to states particularly on the issue of cesses and surcharges?

Suman Bery , who heads Niti Aayog , the govt think tank, is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China, which he says is also an opportunity for India. The economist is confident that Indian states remain resilient. Excerpts of the interview with TOI.The finance ministry expects the economy to grow 7% next year.Given the global situation, how do you see the prospects?The belief in the finance ministry is that we have a possible drag coming from the external sector but that we have other sources. We have enough domestic sources of demand. One has to applaud the political and economic judgment of FM in deciding that it was appropriate to pursue the path of fiscal consolidation. There is transparency. What this actually reflects is responsible economic management, which is one reason we are where we are. Second, it also creates a buffer so that there is policy space if we do encounter headwinds.That’s the hope and expectation. We have an independent central bank and an inflation targeting central bank, so it is up to the monetary policy committee to take a call through the monetary policy committee on the repo rate .The PM has said that when India grows its states grow. India is a composite of 37 states and UTs. They are each at very different points in their demographic transition. There are some states where the net replacement rate is down to 1%, like Kerala . There are others, particularly UP and Bihar, which are in their earliest stage of demographic transition and each one of these states is the size of a large European country. There are two implications of that — one is internal labour mobility and it will become an even larger part of our growth model. The govt has taken several steps to create a unified market. Our main endowment is our human capital and that has to be equipped to participate in global exchange in many ways. We know from China, Japan that the demographic dividend partly depends on markets and on human capital. But the golden period is fairly short lived, about 15 years, when the so called dependency ratio declines. The other big opportunity the PM has been highlighting is bringing women much more into the active labour force.When Niti was set up there was the idea of a three-year vision and a seven-year strategy paper. The reality is that schemes of govt tend to be aligned with the award of the Finance Commission . There are various established building blocks or hand holds which are already a matter of govt policy. The PM is much more interested in a national debate on what it means to be a Viksit Bharat or modern society. We have a collective goal and it is for the democratic polity to define what that goal should be. Its emphatically not for a super mandarin bureaucracy. It is not going to be Lee Kwan Yew’s Singapore led from the top.It’s entirely a finance ministry matter but I would be lying if I didn’t say when I visit certain states there is this complaint. A big frontier would be resource mobilisation at the state level. Second is going to be rationalisation of subsidies not only at the Union level, but also at the state level. All chief ministers sit on my governing council. When they convene as the governing council, I see them in their role as development practitioners. The world is beginning to appreciate quite how much institutional and political maturity India attained in our 75 years and the most fundamental dimension of a democracy, we have orderly transfers of power. There are enough buffers to ensure that what happens in state finances is unlikely to create macro instability. Those risks are well contained by our Constitution. The chief ministers know that they are going to be judged by development outcomes and so you can have the sugar rush of changing of pension plans or various handouts but if the cupboard is bare you are not going to be able to deliver.","Suman Bery is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China.

Government's Marathon to 2047: Emphasis on Fiscal Prudence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/governments-marathon-to-2047-emphasis-on-fiscal-prudence/articleshow/107371788.cms,"What was the thinking behind keeping the vote on account absolutely straight?

So is it the idea to keep the Budget completely transparent?

The capex has risen 11.1% and there is an emphasis on infrastructure spending. But there is also the hope that the private sector will now take over and start capital spending. Given the geopolitical situation, how confident is the govt that it will pan out as planned?

Finance secretary T V Somanathan, in an interview with TOI, says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047 . Excerpts:If you see the Budget speech you will see the emphasis on 2047. The govt has set its sight on running that marathon.Running to 2047 is a marathon , it’s not a sprint. If you are going to run a marathon, you need to be in good shape and you can’t have short-term stimulants or something that will get you some yards and then it’s done.The whole focus is on making India a developed country by 2047, for which a healthy present and a strong fiscal position is an important concomitant. Some purely short term measures don’t really fit into that picture. It’s a consistent picture: focus on the long term for which you need to build strength in the short term and that needs to be done by prudence in fiscal policy and by not doing things which can detract you from that path. Not doing the wrong thing is more important than appearing to do things.The idea is that govt finances may be good, bad or indifferent depending on the times, depending on the circumstances, depending on the policies. But what is the position should be reflected as reasonably and accurately as possible. That is an emphasis. As regards the Finance Commission, again the terms of reference that have been given to them are the terms in the Constitution.What is the means by which the devolution should be done is a matter they have full discretion. They can actually take all kinds of factors into account and in a sense we felt this time based on my review of the previous commissions that the right expression would be less is more. The shorter, less prescriptive terms of reference gives full scope for all stakeholders including state govts to express their viewpoints and for the commission to take a balanced view of the different perspectives and then come to its award. Ultimately the award of the Finance Commission is about devolution and grant for which full scope has now been given to them.n There are incipient signs of private capital expenditure accelerating. There are some surveys I have seen done by some of the chambers industry, which show high levels of investment. The PMI, which is a sort of leading indicator, is also looking pretty healthy. Capacity utilisation is one reason that private sector capital expenditure doesn’t immediately pick up when the economy starts accelerating because there is surplus capacity.But increasingly I get the sense that many industries are beginning to reach levels where they have to add capacity. When that happens capital investment will happen. Another pointer also mentioned in the Budget speech you may notice that our airlines have placed large orders for planes — that is capital expenditure.When you import 1,000 aircraft, it’s just not 1,000 aircraft, there are concomitant additions to ground handling facilities, you need airports to expand, you need to employ people to do that. That means a lot of jobs. The aircraft is capital but then look at the effect it is going to have on skilled jobs. So capital expenditure is happening. I am fairly confident that we will have decent capital expenditure in the year to come and that will become a new source of acceleration.",Finance secretary T V Somanathan says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047.

What is the Section 80C limit for tax deduction for FY 2024-25 after Interim Budget 2024?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/income-tax-budget-2024-2024-2025-section-80c-limit-epf-ppf-elss-nsc/articleshow/107353021.cms,"ALSO READ |

Income Tax Changes Budget 2024 : In the recent Budget 2024 speech, the Finance Minister kept the Section 80C tax deduction limit unchanged. The maximum limit for claiming tax benefits under Section 80C remains at Rs 1.5 lakh for the current fiscal year 2023-24 and will stay the same for individuals looking to save on taxes through Section 80C investments in the upcoming fiscal year 2024-25.Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions. Individuals can reduce their gross taxable income by up to Rs 1.5 lakh per financial year by engaging in these specific investments or expenditures.You can save on taxes through Section 80C by investing in things like Employees' Provident Fund (EPF), Public Provident Fund (PPF), Equity Linked Saving Scheme (ELSS) mutual funds, National Savings Certificate (NSC), and 5-year tax-saving fixed deposits with banks or post offices. Additionally, paying life insurance policy premiums also qualifies for tax benefits under Section 80C.It is important to note that each eligible investment comes with its specific maximum limit, rate of return, liquidity, and taxation rules for the earned returns, states ET in a report. For instance, the most you can invest in PPF in a financial year is Rs 1.5 lakh. Meanwhile, there's no limit on the amount you can invest in ELSS mutual funds, but the Section 80C deduction is capped at Rs 1.5 lakh.If individuals can't make specific investments, they can still get deductions under Section 80C from their gross taxable income through certain expenses. These expenses include repaying the principal amount of a home loan, tuition fees for children, payment of stamp duty, registration fees, and other costs related to buying a house.Since the financial year 2020-21, individuals without any business income must annually choose between the old and new tax regimes. As of the fiscal year 2023-24, the new tax regime is the default option. Consequently, individuals seeking tax deductions under Section 80C must opt for the old tax regime since this deduction isn't available in the new tax regime. It's crucial for taxpayers to be aware of these rules to make informed decisions about their tax planning and investment strategies.","Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget which is an interim budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year. The budget talks about inclusive development both, social and geographical, especially for youth, women, farmers, and the poor. Continued focus on improving logistics through infrastructure spend on roads, rail, airports, ports increases productivity for companies and citizens alike.To make ‘Viksit Bharat’ by 2047, the government’s focus is on improving and empowering people’s capabilities through various skilling initiatives. It is encouraging to see that Skill India Mission has succeeded in training more than 1.4 crore youth and upskilling and reskilling 54 lakh youth. I am particularly happy to see the continued focus on youth and women entrepreneurship and the announcement of a new fund which will give interest free 50 year loans for startups will provide a domestic fillip to startups supplementing venture capital we have traditionally relied on from abroad.PM Mudra Yojana has sanctioned 43 crore loans aggregating to 22.5 lakh crore to youth entrepreneurs and thirty crore Mudra Yojana loans to women entrepreneurs. There are several other schemes like Fund of Funds, Start-Up India, and Start-Up Credit Guarantee schemes that are assisting our youth. Further, the extension of tax benefits to Start-ups and investments made by sovereign wealth funds/pension funds, till 31st March 2025 depicts the government’s effort to support the startup eco- system.This aligns quite well with India Sanitation Coalition’s efforts to give impetus to the start-up world. Over the past 7 editions of our ISC-FICCI Sanitation Awards, we have recognized and promoted several start-ups in the sanitation space, many of whom are successful businesses now!While the finance minister did not provide detailed information on Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH), the budget allocation sees a slight increase in spend demonstrating continued focus on this highly successful program. The acknowledgement that the private sector has increasingly played a substantial role in addressing WASH issues in both urban and rural areas, with numerous projects underway through Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs), highlights the government's commitment to addressing challenges in this sector.A perfect example is the LightHouse Initiative initiated by the Department of Drinking Water along with the India Sanitation Coalition (ISC) by partnering with major corporates across India to develop model villages in Solid and Liquid Waste Management (SLWM) under SBM-Grameen. From this budget, there is an expectation that the government will persist in prioritizing Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) as the path toward achieving the country's Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6). Additionally, it is hoped that the government will uphold its commitment to making necessary infrastructural investments for SLWM.The budget speech rightly celebrates the fact that we have 83 lakh SHGs and 9 crore women beneficiaries. The microfinance movement in the country and the possibility of empowering women members of SHGs through livelihood skilling is a key to bringing women into mainstream economic advancement.The focus on green growth, rooftop solar, wind, biomass, e-vehicles all help with our green energy thrust. The tourism sector was mentioned and could be a huge job provider for youth and women.Guided by the principle ‘Reform, Perform, and Transform’, the budget emphasizes efficient implementation of various policies by improving coordination with states and relevant stakeholders. This is critical both for infra spend and social programsIt is noteworthy that ISC’s Climate Resilient Coastal Cities project which is being implemented in PPP (Public-Private Partnership) mode in four coastal states of Karnataka, Gujarat, Goa and Maharashtra is congruent with the government’s priority of promoting climate-resilient activities for the blue economy 2.0, a scheme for restoration and adaptation measures, and coastal aquaculture.The budget also focuses on the Aspirational districts program where assistance will be given to the states for faster development of aspirational districts and blocks, including the generation of ample economic opportunities. This is again very crucial as it has a huge potential to transform the landscape of our country while making sure no -one is left behind.Overall, this budget has embraced economic strategies and develops the building blocks that nurture and uphold growth, promote inclusive and sustainable development, and enhance productivity.","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year.

Every year, bottlers step up production between March and August but this year they are scrambling to meet demand. The election campaign in the first two weeks of April also pushed demand up.Most of the demand is for 500ml, one-litre and two-litre bottles and not bubble top cans.That’s because many households, which were the main consumers of bubble top cans, have shifted to RO water purifiers.The state is home to 2,100 licensed packaged drinking water plants, of which 60% are located in Chennai, Chengalpet, Kancheepuram and Tiruvallur districts. While the average capacity of each plant is 70,000-80,000 litres a day, plants run at full capacity during the six-month period between March and August. The rest of the year, they operate at 50% of capacity as demand decreases with fall in temperature.The annual size of the packaged drinking water business in Tamil Nadu is estimated at `3,000 crore by industry sources. And it’s expected to grow exponentially as even people in remote villages now depend on packaged drinking water on a daily basis.The demand for packaged drinking water is the highest in the past 25 years, says T Prabakaran, state advisor, Tamil Nadu Packaged Drinking Water Manufacturers Association. “Tourists and the floating population prefer PET water bottles. These contribute about 60% of sales and bubble top cans account for the rest. The share of bubble top cans has fallen because households have started installing RO water purifier systems,” he says. Bottlers expect demand in Chennai and suburbs will further increase next month as families that are on vacation return when educational institutions reopen, he adds.April to June is also the peak wedding season when demand for packaged water also rises, says Nandakumar Rajendran, assistant secretary, Tamil Nadu Packaged Drinking Water Manufacturers Association and proprietor of Vijay Aqua Minerals, Chennai. “The harsh summer pushed demand 30% above the usual spike we experience during this period. In fact, manufacturers are struggling to meet demand,” he adds.Leading mineral water brand Bisleri International says there is an upsurge in sales of both water and fizzy drinks, particularly in regions experiencing extreme heat. “This demand surge is boosted by holiday travel. To enhance affordability and reduce wastage of water, we are introducing a 200ml pack priced at Rs5,” says Tushar Malhotra, director of sales & marketing, Bisleri International.The high temperatures have revived the aerated beverages industry too. “Consumers stayed away from cold beverages during Covid. This scenario continued even after the pandemic ended and this hit our sales. However, the prevailing weather conditions has revived the consumption of aerated beverages to pre-pandemic levels,” says K P D K Karthik, proprietor, Kali Aerated Water Works (Trichy). The size of the Indian market for aerated beverages is pegged at nearly `15,000 crore and Tamil Nadu accounts for a market share of about 15%.Even the chains selling tea and coffee are serving more cold beverages. For instance, Chai King is launching new cold beverages. “Sale of cold beverages usually increases to 35% of the total between April and July. But this year demand started rising in March itself,” says Jahabar Sadique, co-founder and CEO, Chai Kings. “We are introducing 10 new cold beverage varieties such as milk bubble tea and fruit bubble tea,” he adds.“We are witnessing an additional 10% spike in demand for nannari sarbath, buttermilk and rose milk compared to previous summers,” says P Prasanna Venkatesh, co-founder and director, Madras Coffee House. The share of cold beverages in total sales during summer is usually 30%. Now, it has increased to 40%,” he says.In restaurants too, filter coffee is taking a backseat. Ravi Muthukrishnan, chairman, Vasanta Bhavan Hotels, says, customers prefer buttermilk and badam kheer over hot coffee. “The sale of cold beverages has doubled in restaurants,” says Ravi, who is also the president of Chennai Hotels Association.","This summer has sparked an unprecedented 30% surge in demand for packaged drinking water in Tamil Nadu.

Childhood passion drives his career,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/childhood-passion-drives-his-career/articleshow/110060321.cms,"As a child, the only toys Satyakam Arya bought were four-wheel vehicles – a truck, a bus or a car. “I remember the first remote-controlled cars,” he says. “I would do anything to get them and then try to open and see how they work and then struggle to put it all back together.” Later, when he was around 14 or 15 years old, he did the same thing to his father’s car.“The first car we had was a Maruti 800 and I opened some parts but I got a thrashing for it,” he chuckles.Today, as MD & CEO of Daimler India Commercial Vehicles (DICV), Arya links his childhood passion with his corner room conviction – that to head an automobile company, you need to be passionate about automobiles. He started his career with Maruti, then moved to Mahindra Renault and has now been with Daimler for 15 years.“I was one of the first 100 employees to join this company, on Jan 5, 2009,” he says. Since Nov 2018, he has been MD and CEO of DICV. It’s a career that has seen the ups and downs in India’s drive towards becoming an auto hub. “The Indian automotive market is not for the faint-hearted, but DICV has been successful. Today, with 10 years done and Bharat Benz brand established in the market, we are focusing on two things -- sustainable growth and decarbonization of transport.”It’s a 2.0 vision that’s firmly rooted in Daimler’s market learnings in India. “India is the highest growing commercial vehicle market in the world. We saw that India is the place to be quite early, in 2006 and 2007,” says Arya. The company was clear that it needed a game-changing strategy. “We said we will not do things later. We will do all that is needed to be successful from day one, because we bet on this market,” he adds. “That meant 80% localisation as standard operating procedure (which is beyond 90% now) was done upfront and creating a plant (at Oragadam) of this size was done upfront. So today I don’t need to expand the basic infrastructure as it’s set for even 70,000 units per annum,” he says. The other big call that DICV took was to build a local brand – Bharat Benz – and not to play the price game, ever.Looking back, Arya says his automotive passion both drove and transformed his future as he rose up the corporate ladder. “I remember when I used to do my engineering, I wanted to be in R&D,” he says. “Eventually I did not work in R&D at all, but the passion I had and the fact that I understand technology quite a bit helped.” It helped him ask the right questions to run a business. “Which technological bets do you place? How do you create an enabling environment for that technology? Those are the things I picked up during the journey I had,” he says.That learning is important because in the end, it comes down to calling the future correctly. “For any CEO, and even more so in today’s context, envisioning the future is the most important thing,” he says. Why? “Because it’s the job of a business leader to look ahead in terms of the market or technology. How do you envision that and how do you bring that vision to your people?” That crystal ball gaze is critical to the corner office.","Satyakam Arya is the MD & CEO of Daimler India Commercial Vehicles (DICV) He started his career with Maruti, then moved to Mahindra Renault and has now been with Daimlers for 15 years.

All that glitters is plated gold,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/all-that-glitters-is-plated-gold/articleshow/110060348.cms,"They are jewellers to the gods, but also vendors for Isro and the railways. They gold-plated three shrines at Sabarimala and four parts used for the Chandrayaan-2 mission. Mantra Gold Coatings has come a long way since it started operations at Ambattur Industrial Estate in 1998 to cash in on the demand for gold-plated handles, especially in the hospitality industry.Happenstance led to diversification to meet the requirements of temples.Since then, it has become the mainstay, along with the retail business of household puja items.Soon after the company started operations, some people approached the founder to check whether he would be able to do gold-plating of the silver ‘kavacham’ (body cover) of the deity of a perumal temple in Mogappair. “I felt it was like cheating. They should do it completely in gold or not all. So, I said, no,” says Pankaj Bhandari, founder and managing partner Mantra Gold Coverings.“They left disappointed. Later I realized that several trustees of that temple were members of the Ambattur Industrial Estate Manufacturers Association (AIEMA). When the news reached my family, they said as a businessman when a customer has a pain point, your job is to solve that problem,” says Bhandari.Nearly a quarter century later, the temple segment has become a steady source for the company’s 24 carat gold-plating business. “The Padmanabhaswamy temple in Adyar was the next prominent customer in our early days. We have grown steadily since then and we went on to gold-plate the three upasannidhis at Sabarimala,” he says.Since then, several temples have been approaching the company for gold-plating ‘kalasams’, ‘kavachams’, ‘kireetams’, ‘dwaja sthambhams’ and main doors of sanctum sanctorums.“Normally we prefer to work with temples managed by private trusts as dealings are easier. When there was a requirement of a ‘dwaja stambham’ for a temple in Kerala under a Devasom Board, a team of govt and police officials, complete with fully loaded revolvers, descended on our premises. I told my team to extend complete cooperation to them and when the work got completed, the senior official of that team appreciated us for our dedication and quality of work,” says Bhandari.If temples brought big business, demand from individuals helped establish the company’s retail business. “Demand in Chennai was from both south and north Indians. The idols they worship look different, even though the gods are the same. We sensed a business opportunity, tied up with the right artisans and started selling gold-plated idols and opened a showroom in our factory,” he says.What started with idols soon expanded to include accessories for puja rooms in homes. More artisans came into the fold as interior decorations were added, says Bhandari. “Whether the accessories are made of silver, brass or copper, they get blackened due to oxidation. We offered to gold-plate the accessories and it soon became another steady source of business. We now have a separate showroom in the city,” he adds.But Mantra has other customers too, including in the telecom sector, besides Indian Railways and Isro. “At least four gold-plated parts were in the ‘Chandraayan 2’ mission and we are looking for more opportunities,” says Bhandari.","Mantra Gold Coatings started operations at Ambattur Industrial Estate in 1998 to cash in on the demand for gold-plated handles, especially in the hospitality industry.

Why 2 spice cos are in global regulatory soup,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-2-spice-cos-are-in-global-regulatory-soup/articleshow/110062039.cms,"What is the controversy?

What do the firms say?

What has been the response of the regulator, govt?

What do experts say?

Why is it a big deal for the sector?

The spate of regulatory actions overseas against two prominent spices brands have put the spotlight on the industry, which is witnessing robust growth - domestically as well as globally. The issue of safety of food products and companies adhering to global standards have also emerged and there have been calls for stringent action to prevent any malpractices.So, what is at stake for the branded spices industry that is expected to reach Rs 50,000 crore by 2025? Here is an explainer:Hong Kong and Singapore have stopped the sale of spices from two popular Indian brands MDH and Everest. The action came after the authorities detected presence of ethylene oxide beyond permissible limits. Some specific spices from these two brands have also come under the scanner of Australia's Food safety agency. Some reports have said that the US FDA is also looking into products of these two brands. Ethylene oxide is a known carcinogen that can cause DNA damage and disrupt cellular function, leading to the development of various types of cancers over time, says experts.Both Everest and MDH have said that they adhere to strict hygiene and safety standards. Everest has said that its products have not been banned in Hong Kong and Singapore. ""Only one out of 60 Everest products has been held for examination. We reassure our customers that our products are safe and of high quality, so there is no need for concern,"" the firm has said.MDH (Mahashian Di Hatti) has said the company has not received any communication from regulatory authorities of Singapore or Hong Kong and such claims are untrue, lacking any substantiating evidence. The over 100-year-old brand, which is a household name in India, said that it does not use ethylene oxide at any stage of storing, processing or packaging its spices.The food safety regulator - the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) - announced a nationwide check on all manufacturers of spices. The Spices Board of India has also stepped up action, mandating strict checks on food products sold domestically and those for exports. Authorities have reiterated that food safety standards in the country are comprehensive to ensure quality. The FSSAI has also rejected reports as ""misleading and baseless"", which claimed that Indian herbs and spices contain ""elevated levels of pesticides."" Authorities have also unveiled stringent checks on the unorganised sector as well in several parts of the country.Loose enforcement of rules governing food processing has much to do with Indian companies failing safety tests. Besides, there is a lack of infrastructure - govt does not have the right testing labs and also adequate number of people who can go and test products on the ground, said Ravindra Yadav, partner at Technopak Advisors. ""We have still not been stringent enough on how to regulate such kinds of malpractices by companies.""Veena P Panicker, head of biomonitoring-India, at Merck Life Science, said export regulations are very different in every country and it is critical for companies to have adequate knowledge about the regulatory aspects governing each country. She said the knowledge gap is the biggest challenge. ""The second issue is around awareness of test methodologies. Companies need to comply with standardised SOPs (standard operating procedure) created for such tests,"" said Panickar.The controversy comes at a time when the sector has been witnessing robust growth. While the sector has faced such issues earlier too, the timing of the action is likely to hurt sales for some time now. Indian spices have gathered worldwide fame, and thanks to the Indian diaspora, sales have soared over the years. According to Avendus Capital, spices make up the most attractive segment under the food category with blended spices expected to reach 35% of the total organised business by 2025.","Hong Kong and Singapore have stopped the sale of spices from two popular Indian brands MDH and Everest.

Etihad to make the most of Abu Dhabi’s US pre-clearance to attract more Indian travellers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/etihad-to-make-the-most-of-abu-dhabis-us-pre-clearance-to-attract-more-indian-travellers/articleshow/110054749.cms,"CHENNAI: Come September and Etihad will tap into the huge demand for travel between India and America in a big way. While the airline’s Abu Dhabi hub, Zayed International Airport , has for years had US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) facility that lets flyers clear US immigration and customs there itself (thereby skip long queues on arrival), it is making some big changes to get a bigger pie of the lucrative India-US market .The Zayed Airport recently got a new terminal. The US CBP is currently housed in the old terminal. “This September the CBP will move to the new terminal that will, among other things, have a dedicated first and business class lounge especially for pre-cleared (to US) passengers. Also we have deepened our partnership with two US carriers — American Airlines and Jet Blue. So our pre-cleared passengers will get seamless connections to a large number of cities in the shortest possible time starting at 45 minutes after flying into the US on our flights. The baggage will also be through checked-in to the final destination there with passengers not required to collect them in the first port of arrival in the US. Ditto on the way back,” Arik De, Etihad’s chief revenue & commercial officer, told TOI.“With all the checks out of the way before you take-off, you can simply pick up your bags and go when you land in the US. Abu Dhabi has only CBP facility in the Middle East,” he added. Etihad currently flies to New York (JFK), Chicago, Boston and Washington. It plans to double its US presence before the end of this decade. With its pre-clearance USP, Etihad is eying the India market in a big way for filling up its flights to and from the US — a market where neighbours Emirates and Qatar Airways are both very strong in.The airline is among the rare Gulf carriers that still has room, read bilaterals, for more flights to India. “Abu Dhabi has 50,000 seats per week to India of which along with Air Arabia Abu Dhabi about 42,000 seats are being used. We are increasing flights to Bengaluru (going from 14 to 18 weekly); Kolkata (going to 7 to 8 weekly) and starting four times weekly to Jaipur on June 16. The next round of expansion in India will be in January-March 2025 when we get more planes,” said Kolkata-born De, who is among the first Indian origin professionals to rise to top positions at a leading Gulf carrier.Etihad is making more changes to attract more Indian passengers. For instance, he has changed something a majority of Gulf carriers don’t do — they don’t take meals from India for their flights back home as meals for both the route to India and back are uplifted at their hubs only. “Of the 11 cities in India that we fly to, meal is being uplifted from 8-9 of them in India only now. That ensures we serve fresh meals to passengers from India to Abu Dhabi,” said De, a Canadian national.Etihad has 5-6,000 crew members, of which Indians, Moroccans and Romanians comprise the biggest numbers.He does not see the long haul plans of IndiGo — which has ordered wide bodies now — and the growth of Air India as a challenge to Etihad. “A country of over 1.3 billion people with a booming economy, India certainly will have its own big airlines. There will always be market for both the nonstop product (that AI offers far and wide and IndiGo will offer from next year). For example, Mumbai-London has nonstops from AI, Vistara, British Airways and Virgin Atlantic. Yet we have 12% market share on that route,” De said.Etihad currently has 90 aircraft. It aims to have a fleet of 165-170 planes — almost as many wide and narrow bodies — by 2030.","Etihad is making big changes to get a bigger pie of the lucrative India-US market.

Chinese companies win more bids to explore for Iraq oil and gas,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/chinese-companies-win-more-bids-to-explore-for-iraq-oil-and-gas/articleshow/110053358.cms,"CAIRO: Chinese companies ZhenHua and CNOOC Iraq have won bids to explore Iraqi oil and gas fields, Iraq's oil minister said as the Middle East country's hydrocarbon exploration licensing round continued into its second day on Sunday.The oil and gas licences for 29 projects are mainly aimed at ramping up output for domestic use, with more than 20 companies pre-qualifying, including European, Chinese, Arab and Iraqi groups.Chinese companies have been the only foreign players to win bids, taking seven oil and gas fields since Saturday, while Iraqi Kurdish company KAR Group took two.There were notably no U.S. oil majors involved, even after Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia met representatives of U.S. companies on an official visit to the United States last month.China's CNOOC Iraq won a bid to develop Iraq's Block 7 for oil exploration that extends across the country's central and southern provinces of Diwaniya, Babil, Najaf, Wasit and Muthanna, Iraq's oil minister said on Sunday.China's ZhenHua won a bid to develop the Abu Khaymah oilfield in Iraq's southern Muthanna province, he said.Iraq's main goal with its sixth licensing round was to increase gas output that it wants to use to fire power plants that rely heavily on gas imported from Iran. However, no bids were made on at least two fields with large gas potential, potentially undermining those efforts.Iraq, OPEC's second-largest oil producer behind Saudi Arabia, has been hampered in its oil sector development by contract terms viewed as unfavourable by many major oil companies as well as recurring military conflict in the region and growing investor focus on environmental, social and governance criteria.","Chinese companies ZhenHua and CNOOC Iraq have won bids to explore Iraqi oil and gas fields.

His pioneering use of computer signals for trading decisions earned him the nickname "" Quant King .""With a net worth estimated at $31 billion by Forbes, Simons also became a prominent philanthropist, giving away billions of dollars during his lifetime to support medical and science research, teaching and Democratic candidates.""Churchill said 'great and good are seldom the same man.'

Further hurting output is an increase in citrus greening , a disease that causes fruit to prematurely drop from trees, Fundecitrus said.Poor production in Brazil will likely have a dramatic impact on global orange juice supply, as the country accounts for about 70% of total exports of the beverage.A global shortage of oranges has been aggravated by declining output from US top juice producer Florida, following decades of damage from disease spread.

NEW DELHI: CEO of Tesla , Elon Musk , on Friday announced that the company plans to invest over $500 million this year to install new superchargers . This announcement comes just days after reports surfaced about layoffs within this branch of the company.In a post on X, Musk wrote, ""Just to reiterate: Tesla will spend well over $500M expanding our Supercharger network to create thousands of NEW chargers this year.""""That's just on new sites and expansions, not counting operations costs, which are much higher,"" he added.According to a report by The Information on Monday, Tesla was in the process of disbanding its supercharger department, resulting in the layoff of most of its 500 employees, including the senior director.This news raised concerns regarding the future expansion of Tesla's vast network of over 50,000 fast chargers , which is currently the largest in the world, according to Tesla these chargers can add 320 kilometers of range in just fifteen minutes.The fear of inadequate charging infrastructure is one of the reasons why sales of electric vehicles are progressing less rapidly than expected in the United States. Tesla's well-established network was seen as key to reassuring customers.In the spring of 2023, several competitors, including Ford, General Motors, and Rivian, formed partnerships with Tesla to allow their vehicles to access its fast-charging network in Canada and the United States.A few weeks later seven automakers - BMW, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Mercedes-Benz, and Stellantis - announced a joint venture to install at least 30,000 fast chargers across North America starting this summer, which will be accessible to all electric vehicles, regardless of brand.The reported layoffs within Tesla's supercharger department coincided with the company's announcement of a 55% decline in quarterly earnings, amounting to $1.1 billion, reflecting the overall decrease in electric vehicle sales during that period.","Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, on Friday announced that the company plans to invest over $500 million this year to install new superchargers.

Lukenas, who was involved in a $2 billion merger just days before his passing, reportedly worked approximately 100 hours per week leading up to the completion of the deal.His death from ""acute coronary artery thrombus"" at the age of 35 has sparked intense debate and anger among his peers and the wider community.The reaction on Wall Street has been swift and severe, with many pointing fingers at the demanding work culture prevalent in many financial institutions, including Bank of America. Discussions among employees about a potential walkout have been reported, as staff consider drastic measures to call for better working conditions. This potential action is underscored by a growing sentiment that the health and well-being of employees are being sacrificed for profit, a New York Post report said.Social media platforms and financial forums like Wall Street Oasis have become battlegrounds for discussions about the industry's work ethics. A post outlining demands for improved employee welfare, including capping work hours and guaranteeing weekends off, has gained significant traction with over 450 comments supporting the call for change.Despite the outcry, Bank of America has not announced any plans to investigate the circumstances leading to Lukenas’s death or to review its work policies. A spokesperson from the bank expressed condolences but noted that there would be no action taken against Gary Howe, Lukenas’s supervisor, nor any inquiries into the allegations of forced long work hours.As Wall Street faces renewed scrutiny over its work practices, the situation at Bank of America may serve as a pivotal moment for reform in the industry, echoing past instances where tragedies led to changes in workplace policies across financial institutions.","Leo Lukenas III, a Bank of America associate and former Green Beret, died from ""acute coronary artery thrombus"" at the age of 35.

Conducted from the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, where he is serving a 25-year sentence , Bankman-Fried revealed to Puck News' William D Cohan that he lives in a large, dormitory-style room with 35 other inmates, surviving mainly on beans and rice from the commissary.This staple diet has turned rice into an unexpected form of currency within the prison walls, with inmates using it to barter for other goods.During the interview, which had to be conducted without the aid of recording devices or notes due to prison regulations, Bankman-Fried discussed his adaptation to prison life. He described a routine that includes less engagement with the available television sets and more time spent on a tablet playing games or watching movies. Notably thinner, having lost approximately 25 pounds, he commented on the vegan meals provided, which he and other inmates find inedible, even comparing their smell to ""shit."" Despite the harsh conditions, he said he has not experienced abuse and does not fear for his personal safety, though he did mention being pestered by other inmates for his rice at night, an Insider report said.Bankman-Fried also reiterated his stance on the legal proceedings, insisting on his innocence and expressing his intentions to appeal his conviction on several counts including wire fraud, money laundering, and conspiracy. These charges stem from allegations that he misappropriated billions of dollars of FTX customer funds—a scandal that US Attorney Damian Williams labeled as one of the largest financial frauds in American history. As Bankman-Fried navigates these challenges, he remains a central figure in ongoing discussions about the regulation and risks associated with cryptocurrency markets.","Sam Bankman-Fried has opened up about his daily life and legal battles in his first detailed interview since his imprisonment.

Dogeverse ($DOGEVERSE) is one of the hottest cryptocurrencies of May 2024.The multichain meme coin has become a sensation in a brief time. In less than a month of the presale launch, Dogeverse has secured more than $13M. The presale gained strength after its Solana integration .The final stage of the presale is now live. Dogeverse is hosting one of the most successful presales of 2024 now.Due to the escalating demand for the token, the presale is expected to sell out ahead of schedule.Investors and traders are pouring millions into the presale. In fact, the soft cap allocation of 200 billion tokens was sold out instantly. Within days of its launch, the multichain meme coin was viral. It showed resilience even during the broader market downturns of April.The large growth potential of the project is further made evident by the Dogeverse Twitter community that was launched just last month. It has now grown to 13.9K members.What’s behind the growing interest in the project?Much of Dogeverse’s viral growth has to do with its multichain foundation. The largely unexplored feature sets the project apart from dog coins.Dogeverse is launching on six top blockchains – Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, Solana, Avalanche, and Base.Once the presale ends, investors will have to acquire the token from popular crypto exchanges. But if the presale FOMO is any indication, a turbocharged debut launch is awaiting the token. Waiting until the exchange launches might prove expensive for investors.Both degens and whales are securing $DOGEVERSE tokens in large numbers now to avoid the hefty price tag later.The meme coin market is teeming with hundreds of different projects.But they are often knockoffs of popular ones like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, or Pepe. While this quick strategy helps them gain immediate attention, it doesn’t serve projects aiming for long-term relevance.That explains why most meme coins are short-living. The lack of focus on building a robust meme coin foundation renders them fleeting.Establishing relevance is crucial for long-term sustainability in a crowded space.This understanding is at the core of Dogeverse.It stands out due to its deep-rooted multichain infrastructure that is building an interconnected universe for doge enthusiasts. It blends community, rewards, and creativity.Dogeverse is a logical investment from a speculative standpoint as well.Given that four of the top five meme coins are dog-themed, there is growing hype around Dogeverse Celebrities like Elon Musk, entrepreneur Mark Cuban, and musicians Gene Simmons and Snoop Dogg are fans of dog coins, which adds to the buzz.Cosmo the Doge is journeying across Dogeverse.Cosmo’s goal is to help meme coin investors tap into the unique advantages of different blockchains. For example, the project's availability on the world's top six blockchains offers high flexibility, as users can access the token on any of these networks.Cosmo's ability to ""hyperjump"" between blockchains facilitates seamless transactions with minimal fees, enabling investors to optimise returns.Dogeverse also unlocks hot crypto trends like Solana meme coins with its multichain infrastructure. Solana's robust digital economy with a massive total value locked (TVL) and a large user base is behind the craze.Trending meme coins such as Dogwifhat, Bonk, MEW, and Slerf climbed the charts in 2024, capitalising on their Solana label.The presence on six hot networks aligns Dogeverse with more blockchain-based meme coin trends.The Dogeverse presale has raised $13M+ so far. The final presale stage is now underway, offering investors the last chance to buy the token for a fixed discounted price of $0.00031 per unit.Staking rewards with up to 71% APY accompany presale investments.Market forces will dictate the token price after the presale. Dogeverse has introduced staking on Ethereum to encourage early backers. The promise of passive income helps reduce early sell-offs and supports the token's long-term price stability.The growing hype surrounding the chain-hopping Cosmo indicates that Dogeverse is moving toward a turbocharged launch. The technical prowess and strong community backing, on the other hand, strengthen its sustainability.The multichain token’s growing popularity shows that it has the potential to make the list of top meme coins this year.","Dogeverse ($DOGEVERSE) is one of the hottest cryptocurrencies of May 2024.

Chinese tech executive fired after endorsing toxic work culture on social media,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/chinese-tech-executive-fired-after-endorsing-toxic-work-culture-on-social-media/articleshow/110002210.cms,"NEW DELHI: Qu Jing , the former vice president and head of communications at Baidu, China's counterpart to Google, has been ousted following a backlash over her public endorsement of a rigorous workplace culture. Her remarks, which sparked widespread outrage among young workers in China, highlighted deep-seated issues within the tech industry regarding work-life balance and employee treatment .As per a CNN report, Qu Jing came under fire after a series of videos posted on Douyin, China's version of TikTok, revealed her stringent management style and lack of empathy towards employees' personal circumstances. In one notable video, Qu rebuked an employee for not wanting to undertake a 50-day business trip during strict Covid-19 travel restrictions, stating, ""Why should I take my employee’s family into consideration? I’m not her mother-in-law.""Her blunt comments about her personal sacrifices, such as forgetting her elder son's birthday due to work commitments, and demanding employees to be available 24/7, intensified the public outcry. ""If you work in public relations, don’t expect weekends off,"" she asserted in another video, emphasizing the relentless demands placed on her team.The backlash was swift and fierce, with netizens and media pundits criticizing Qu for promoting an unhealthy work environment synonymous with the controversial ""996"" working hour system—9 am to 9 pm, six days a week—previously endorsed by figures like Alibaba’s Jack Ma. Ivy Yang, a tech analyst, observed, ""A lot of what she said really struck a nerve, because people feel that in their own workplaces very often. The fact that she said it in a way that’s so direct and in your face, it just generated this kind of emotional response.""Following the controversy, Qu was compelled to remove her executive title from her Douyin account and issued an apology on WeChat, acknowledging the insensitivity of her remarks: “I have carefully read all the opinions and comments from various platforms, and many criticisms are very pertinent. I deeply reflect on and humbly accept them.”The incident has reignited discussions about work culture in China's tech industry, which has been notorious for its demanding expectations and the glorification of overwork. This sector has faced increasing scrutiny as employees push back against the long-standing norms of excessive work hours and the lack of work-life balance.Baidu has not made an official statement regarding Qu's departure, and efforts to get comments from the company remained unanswered as of Thursday night. Qu’s videos have since been removed from Douyin, reflecting the severity of the backlash and the ongoing debate over corporate culture in one of the world's most dynamic technological hubs.","Qu Jing, the former vice president and head of communications at Baidu, China's counterpart to Google, has been ousted following a backlash over her public endorsement of a rigorous workplace culture.
