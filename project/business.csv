"ITR Filing FY 2023-24: What happens if I file income tax return after deadline? Check penalties, consequences for late filing",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/taxation/itr-filing-fy-2023-24-what-happens-if-i-file-income-tax-return-after-deadline-check-penalties-consequences-for-late-filing/articleshow/112105116.cms,"What is the penalty for belated ITR filing?

Who is required to pay the penalty?

Income Exceeds Basic Exemption Limit: Taxpayers whose income exceeds the basic exemption limit will be penalised for late filing. The limit varies by tax regime: Rs 3 lakh under the new tax regime, irrespective of age, and different limits under the old tax regime based on age.

Section 139(1) Conditions: Even if income is below the exemption limit, taxpayers must file an ITR if they meet specific conditions in Section 139(1). These include:

Spending Rs 2 lakh or more on foreign travel. Paying Rs 1 lakh or more in electricity bills. Depositing Rs 1 crore or more in current accounts.

Holding Foreign Assets: Residents with foreign assets or income must file an ITR, even if their income is below the exemption limit. Late filing fees apply in these cases.

Exceptions to Penalties

How is a belated ITR filed?

Income Tax Return Filing FY 2023-24 : For individual taxpayers whose accounts do not need auditing, the last date to file income tax returns (ITRs) for FY 2023–24 (AY 2024–25) is July 31, 2024. Missing this deadline means filing a belated ITR , which comes with penalties and interest.Under Section 234F of the Income Tax Act, 1961, filing a belated ITR incurs a penalty of up to Rs 5,000.For small taxpayers with a taxable income not exceeding Rs 5 lakh, the penalty is restricted to Rs 1,000, according to an ET report. The important thing to note is that this penalty applies even if the belated ITR shows zero tax payable. Additionally, penal interest on the pending tax payable must be paid when filing a belated ITR.Certain taxpayers are required to pay penalties if they miss the ITR filing deadline and they fulfil the following conditions:Also Read | ITR refund status for FY 2023-24: How to check income tax refund status online - here’s a step-by-step guide for incometax.gov.in & NSDL websites Individuals might need to submit an income tax return to receive a refund. However, if their taxable income is below the basic exemption limit, they will not face penalties for filing after the due date, according to income tax laws. This means the gross taxable income is considered before any eligible deductions are accounted for.The process for filing a belated ITR is the same as filing on time, with the key difference being the selection of Section 139(4) instead of 139(1) on the ITR form.","Filing a belated ITR incurs a penalty of up to Rs 5,000 under the Income Tax Act, 1961.

"Stock market crash today: Why BSE Sensex, Nifty50 have plunged in trade hit by US recession fears",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/stock-market-crash-today-bse-sensex-nifty50-august-05-2024-dalal-street-indian-equities-global-markets/articleshow/112275085.cms,"Why BSE Sensex, Nifty50 have crashed today

Several factors have contributed to the decline in the Sensex and Nifty.

Fourthly,

Lastly,

Stock market crash today: BSE Sensex and Nifty50, the Indian equity benchmark indices, crashed in trade on Monday tracking global cues. BSE Sensex ended the day at 78,759.40, down 2,223 points or 2.74%. Nifty50 ended the day at 24,049.95, down 668 points or 2.70%.ALSO CHECK | Stock market crash LIVE: BSE Sensex, Nifty50 plunge as US recession fears hit global markets hard In intra-day trade, BSE Sensex plummeted over 2,600 points and the Nifty slipped below the 24,000-level.Consequently, the market capitalization of all listed companies on the BSE decreased by Rs 17 lakh crore. The decline was more pronounced in smaller and midcap stocks.Dr. V K Vijayakumar of Geojit Financial attributed the recent rally in global stock markets to expectations of a soft landing for the US economy. However, these expectations are now being challenged by the disappointing US job creation data in July and the sharp increase in the unemployment rate to 4.3%. Additionally, rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and the unwinding of the Yen carry trade are contributing to the market's concerns.the global financial markets experienced significant turbulence on Monday, with Asian share markets plummeting and investors seeking refuge in bonds. The shift in sentiment was driven by growing concerns that the United States economy may be heading towards a recession, prompting market participants to rapidly adjust their expectations for interest rates.In a recent note, Goldman Sachs analysts stated, ""We have increased our 12-month recession odds by 10pp to 25%,"" although they believed that the Federal Reserve's extensive capacity to loosen monetary policy would help mitigate the risk. Goldman Sachs has revised its forecast and now anticipates quarter-point rate cuts in September, November, and December.Global emerging market stocks plummeted on Monday as investors grew increasingly concerned about the possibility of a recession in the United States, prompting a worldwide selloff and a shift towards safer assets such as the Japanese yen. The MSCI index, which tracks emerging market equities, dropped by 4.1% as the steep decline in Japanese stocks spread across Asian markets, while apprehensions about technology sector earnings put pressure on stock exchanges in Taiwan and South Korea.The risk-averse sentiment carried over from Friday, when ""a weaker-than-expected U.S. jobs data triggered worries of recession in the world's largest economy."" This further exacerbated the concerns for emerging markets, which were already grappling with issues in China, a series of disappointing tech sector earnings, and heightened geopolitical tensions in the Middle East.In response to the growing economic uncertainty, traders are now anticipating a more aggressive 50 basis points interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve during its September meeting, a significant shift from the more conservative 25 bps cut that was expected just last week. This change in expectations underscores the mounting fears of a potential economic downturn and the need for decisive action by central banks to mitigate its impact.the unwinding of the Yen carry trade, triggered by the Bank of Japan's interest rate hike and reduced bond purchases, has led to a sell-off in US tech stocks, affecting global markets .geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, particularly the potential for attacks from Iran and its allies, have weighed on market sentiment.concerns about overvaluation in the Indian market, as indicated by the high market capitalization to GDP ratio, have put pressure on overvalued segments like Defence and Railways.the June quarter results season has not provided any significant positive triggers to drive the market forward.","BSE Sensex and Nifty50, the Indian equity benchmark indices, crashed in trade on Monday tracking global cues.

Boost for security forces on India-China border! The Border Roads Organisation ( BRO ), in collaboration with the Central Public Works Department ( CPWD ) and the National Projects Construction Corporation , has commenced the third phase of the strategic India, China Border Roads ( ICBR ) project.This initiative aims to enhance the road network in eastern Ladakh, facilitating faster movement of security forces along the Line of Actual Control.While some key roads under Phase II of ICBR are still under construction, most of the phase has been completed, providing all-weather roads for improved connectivity, according to an ET report.India and China share a 3,488 km border spanning across Ladakh, Arunachal, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and Sikkim. Following the 2020 standoff with the Chinese army at Galwan in eastern Ladakh, the Union government has accelerated the pace of road construction and identified new roads under the third phase of ICBR.According to official data, India has achieved a formation cutting rate of 470 km roads per year from 2017-20, a significant increase from the 230 km per year maintained in the previous decade until 2017. Under ICBR phases I and II, 73 roads were identified as strategic, with 61 of them assigned to BRO. In eastern Ladakh, five new roads have been identified under phase 3, to be constructed by BRO and CPWD. In many cases, single or double-lane roads have been upgraded to four lanes.Last week, Prime Minister Narendra Modi initiated the first blast for the Shinku La tunnel, which is expected to provide all-weather connectivity from Manali to Leh. The 4.1-kilometre tunnel is anticipated to facilitate the movement of armed forces and equipment.The Union Budget 2024 recently allocated Rs 6,500 crore to BRO for 2024-25, a 30% increase compared to the allocation for 2023-24.

NEW DELHI: Competition Commission of India 's investigative arm has found tech giant Apple abusing market dominance and engaging in unfair business practices to the detriment of lakhs of app developers and consumers, opening the prospects of potential fines running into thousands of crores of rupees as well as restraining orders.The probe, which has been on since 2021, now seems to be veering towards closure that will see the fair play watchdog take strict action against Apple, something it also did in the case of Google India which faced similar charges of abuse of dominance.""...it can be concluded that by virtue of its dominant position in the market for app stores for iOS in India, Apple engaged in abusive conduct and practices in violation of Section 3(4) and Section 4 of the Competition Act,"" a supplementary probe report by CCI's investigation arm says, top sources told TOI.""... investigation is of the opinion that Apple has entered into anti-competitive agreements with app developers which have the effect of causing 'appreciable adverse effect on competition' in the market,"" sources said while adding that investigation report runs into 150-odd pages and censures Apple's in-app purchase (IAP) mandate.The probe found Apple's App Store an ""unavoidable trading partner"" for app developers who have ""no choice but to adhere to Apple's unfair terms, including the mandatory use of Apple's proprietary billing and payment system.""In its submission in an investigation by the Competition Commission of India, Apple argued its in-app purchase (IAP) is the method by which the company collects its commission, which in turn allows it to maintain and develop the App Store as a “safe, trusted environment for users and developers”.“Apple imposes several onerous conditions via developer program license agreement (DPLA) and Appstore review guidelines. The anti-steering provisions restrict the app developers from communicating alternative purchase methods within the app. Accordingly, no third-party payment processor is permitted to provide services for the digital content on iOS devices,” sources said on the findings.They added that the iPhone maker also imposes “discriminatory” commission on certain app makers while gaining unfairly from their data. While charging a peak 30% commission from many digital apps, Apple does not charge any commission from its proprietary apps like Apple Music, Apple Arcade Games, which is seen as a violation of the provisions. The report also says that mandatory use of Apple’s in-app purchase (IAP) “adversely affects the app developers, end users and other payment processors which leads to unprofitable situations, hindering innovation and prohibiting expansion of markets” and resulting in violation of provisions under Section 4 of the Act.“Such practice deters entry and innovation. Moreover, the restrictions imposed by Apple forecloses the market for third-party app stores and third-party payment processors which is in violation… .” The investigation says that since Apple has a monopoly over the distribution of iOS apps, the developers have “no choice but to assent to this anti-competitive tie-in-arrangement” while the company’s marketing curbs makes it difficult to inform their users about out-of-app purchases, all of which are violations.","Competition Commission of India's investigative arm has found tech giant Apple abusing market dominance and engaging in unfair business practices.

Budget 2024 capital gains tax changes: The Narendra Modi government is considering suggestions for tweaks in the new long term capital gains tax regime that was announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman in Union Budget 2024.The July 23 budget reduced the LTCG tax on property from 20% to 12.5%. The indexation benefit, which allowed taxpayers to adjust the acquisition cost for inflation before calculating capital gains and thus reduce their tax liability, is proposed to be eliminated for properties purchased on or after April 1, 2001.The government publishes the Cost Inflation Index (CII) annually for this calculation.India Inc is appealing to the government for a gradual shift to the long-term capital gains tax regime proposed in the FY25 budget, which aims to eliminate indexation benefits for property, gold, and other unlisted assets.According to an ET report by Deepshikha Sikarwar, the industry is suggesting alternatives such as a higher tax rate with indexation or a lower rate of 12.5% without indexation, as well as some form of grandfathering for ancestral properties.The finance ministry is currently reviewing these proposals and will discuss them with the Prime Minister's Office. The final decision will be made closer to the date when the Finance Bill reply is to be presented in Parliament, the reports said.Industry groups are expected to submit formal proposals to the finance ministry in the near future.

Budget 2024 for manufacturing sector : The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth. While the middle class has been offered tax relief, the government's primary focus remains on judicious spending to maximize economic impact. The budget's core themes are employment, skilling, MSME development, and support for the middle class.Largely focus has remained intact on spending money judiciously to ensure that each penny spent creates a ripple effect in the entire economic landscape.Although at first glance, manufacturing might appear to have taken a backseat, a deeper analysis reveals a multifaceted approach to bolstering the sector. Initiatives like employment-linked benefits and internship programs, while primarily aimed at job creation and skill development, indirectly benefit manufacturing companies by expanding the talent pool.Extensive focus on the MSME manufacturing units by way of extending term loan facility for purchase of machinery and equipment without collateral or third-party guarantee, would help companies in augmenting their capital base/ capacity and strengthen the very foundation of the manufacturing ecosystem in the country. Development of a new credit-assessment model by Public Sector Banks to assess MSME credit shall provide much needed regulatory relief to the units.With respect to the large manufacturing entities, while there is no direct fiscal/ tax incentive introduced in this budget, some support has been provided with an extensive focus on development of ‘industrial parks’ in nearly 100 cities under the ‘plug and play’ model. Reforms proposed with respect to land administration, planning and management, shall also ease out acquisition related difficulties often faced by entrepreneurs/ business houses in acquiring lands for manufacturing set-ups.Targeted Customs duty interventions like, rationalization of Customs duty provisions in Mobile phone manufacturing setups, extension of Customs duty exemption on import of capital goods for manufacturing of solar cells and panels, full Customs duty exemption on import of 25 critical minerals,, shall provide the required impetus for enhancing domestic manufacturing environment.Governments’ focus on formulating an Economic Policy Framework to set the scope for next-gen reforms in the country, has a target to improve the productivity of factors of production, namely, land, labour, capital, entrepreneurship and technology. This shall pave the way for enabling achievement of a target of 25% manufacturing sector contribution to the nation’s GDP over the course of next 7-10 years.While the overall outlook is positive, the extension of tax benefits under Section 115BAB for manufacturing entities and the absence of new PLI schemes are notable omissions.The country’s manufacturing base is expanding as is reflective from the continuously increasing tax collections and expanding Purchasing Manager’s Index. It would be pertinent to see how the ground realities evolve vis-à-vis the vision envisaged, in the upcoming Financial Year.","The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth.

Budget 2024: Armed with the vision to propel India to become a developed country by 2047, the Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business thereby providing the required stimulus to the manufacturing sector and enabling large scale job creation.On the Indirect tax front, the industry welcomes the much-needed announcement for a comprehensive review of the rate structure under Customs enabling ease in product classification and dispute reduction. The proposal of lowering of Customs duty on a plethora of raw materials and products including solar cells, critical minerals and bullion are encouraging measures. The rationale behind such reduction clearly indicates support towards domestic manufacturing, deepening value addition and supporting targets in reducing carbon footprint.Relevant amendments under the Customs law have been made to provide increased time limits for re-imports and re-exports to enhance competitiveness of the fledgling MRO sector. The government has extended significant duty reduction and exemption benefits to the healthcare and electronics sectors, continuing the impetus of incentives provided under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme.Since their introduction in March 2020, the PLI schemes have indeed supported in revitalizing the manufacturing sector and strengthening the necessary supply chains. The success achieved in the mobile manufacturing sector has now enabled the Government to reduce customs duties on mobile phones and components, signalling a mature environment. The Budget proposals aim at reproducing similar outcomes for semiconductor and pharmaceutical industry by increasing the budgetary allocation.Buoyed by the increasing revenue collection under GST signalling a shift towards a mature tax regime, this Budget has harmonized the timeframes for the issuance of demand notices and adjudication orders for cases involving fraud, suppression or otherwise. Significant amendments to the GST legislations have been introduced reflecting the recommendations proposed by the GST Council such as regularizing non-levy of GST due to general practice which may turn out to be a breather for certain impacted industries reeling under huge tax demands.The Insurance sector has been provided much relief through the GST council recommendations which have been cemented in the present budget thereby ending long standing disputes on their business practices.The Government's efforts to push forward with its reform agenda are evident as plans to incentivize states for their business reform actions plans and digitalization through the Jan Vishwas Bill 2.0 is proposed. Further, setting up of e-commerce export hubs is envisaged to facilitate easier access to international markets for domestic players.The recent implementation of Budget proposals allows the government to maintain momentum in its reform agenda. These policy measures implicitly reaffirm the significance of India Inc as a crucial element in the development of infrastructure. However, there are still some expectations required to be met to march towards a Viksit Bharat 2047.",The Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business.

Budget 2024 : Real estate, a significant contributor to employment generation, has received a fair bit of attention in Budget 2024-25. Recent years have seen the sector transform rapidly, driven by factors such as favourable government policies, Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, strong economic growth and changing consumer preferences.Added to that, the budgetary focus on job creation, skilling and employment-linked incentives, infrastructure, urban development, rural connectivity, digitalisation and land-related norms, all dovetail to promote growth of the sector.Launched in June 2015, the PMAY aims to provide affordable housing to all eligible beneficiaries. The budget unveiled PMAY Urban 2.0, under which the housing needs of 1 crore urban poor and middle class will be addressed with an investment of Rs 10 lakh crore.The central government’s additional Rs 2.2 lakh crore injection in the next 5 years to make housing more affordable has the potential to revitalise the affordable housing market.Such an approach can play an important role in realising the government's vision of Housing for All and push growth and development. Hence, the significant investment under PMAY Urban 2.0 is expected to alleviate urban housing deficits, spurring construction and economic growth.Steps to introduce technological reforms within the regulatory framework for land, such as digitalisation or GIS mapping of land records, will improve transparency.Rationalisation of stamp duty across states will also be critical to bring in uniformity and initiate land-related reforms such as urban planning, usage and building bylaws.These are steps in the right direction and will boost growth. Moreover, they will improve the ease of property transactions and strengthen municipal finances through increased property taxes. Rationalization of stamp duty with an emphasis on women homebuyers may boost home-buyer sentiment in major cities, too.The budget has also given ample attention to urban and rural development, with rental housing for industrial workers through the public private partnership model, interest subsidies for rental housing, and transit-oriented developments.The proposal to develop investment-ready plug-and-play industrial parks in 100 cities may attract industrial investment, leading to increased demand for industrial real estate and support the growth of ancillary services and residential developments in these regions.Initiatives for industrial parks and rental housing for industrial workers align with the country’s manufacturing goals and addresses worker accommodation needs.These steps are expected to promote industrial growth and stability in labour-intensive sectors, while also creating new opportunities for real estate developers specialising in rental and affordable housing.The changes in long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax, however, have evoked a mixed reaction. The government lowered the long-term capital gains tax from 20% to 12.5%, which is a welcome step. However, this came with the removal of the indexation benefit.The changes could encourage more liquidity in property transactions and potentially increase the effective tax burden depending on the property’s acquisition date.The launch of Phase IV of the PM Gram Sadak Yojana in 25,000 rural habitations will improve connectivity in rural areas, promoting rural development and making these regions more accessible for investment. The primary objective of PMGSY is to build robust, all-weather roads in rural habitations. This initiative focuses on enhancing connectivity and supporting economic development in rural areas.In essence, the budget is geared towards stimulating growth and investment in the real estate sector , fostering a more transparent and investor-friendly environment, and contributing to overall development. It aims to create a balanced and inclusive growth environment by addressing the needs of various segments, including affordable housing, industrial workers and urban infrastructure.The effectiveness of the initiatives, however, hinges on their implementation and continued support of complementary reforms.","Budget 2024-25 is geared towards stimulating growth and investment in the real estate sector.

New Budget 2024 rule: Why Income Tax Department is likely to issue a huge number of tax notices this month,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-budget-2024-rule-why-income-tax-department-is-likely-to-issue-a-huge-number-of-tax-notices-this-month/articleshow/112186079.cms,"Taxing Times

Income Tax Notice on the way? The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month, as there are concerns that many taxpayers might escape the tax net due to the impending implementation of the new reassessment law on September 1, 2024.According to the amended regulation announced in Budget 2024 , the tax authorities can only go back a maximum of five years to reassess a taxpayer's records if the escaped income is at least Rs 50 lakh, and three years for an amount less than Rs 50 lakh.Previously, they could reassess cases up to 10 years old.According to an ET report, tax officials are now faced with the challenge of compiling and corroborating data on tax and income mismatches for the financial years 2013-14 to 2017-18 within the next few weeks, as these years will become time-barred for reassessment from September 1, 2024.The I-T department relies on information from various sources, such as banks, property registrars, and search findings from the investigation wing, to build reassessment cases.A tax officers' body has raised concerns about the feasibility of issuing notices under Section 148 (or 148A) in a large number of cases within a single month, given the overburdened nature of the jurisdictional assessing officers and the time-consuming process of obtaining sanction from the chief commissioner, who is the specified authority for such notices.Moreover, the law provides taxpayers with the right to explain their position before reassessment orders are finalized, a process that most believe cannot be completed by the end of August.Also Read | ITR refund status for FY 2023-24: How to check income tax refund status online - here’s a step-by-step guide for incometax.gov.in & NSDL websites The Central Board of Direct Taxes ( CBDT ) has been urged by its officers to postpone the effective date of the proposed amendment. However, this suggestion is unlikely to be well-received by corporations and high net worth individuals.""Capping the reassessment period at five years was a great decision as it would reduce hassles and litigation. But if the department fears there could be a genuine loss of revenue as it may not be possible to wrap up several matters by August 31, the government can think of strict parameters where time-bound cases can be selectively reopened - based on trails of steps taken in identifying escaped income,"" said Mitil Chokshi, partner at CA firm Chokshi & Chokshi.""Taxpayers may expect a rush of reassessment notices in August 2024. These notices are likely to be for the AYs 2018-19 and prior to that. It is pertinent to note that the Bombay High Court in a recent ruling in a case of Hexaware Technologies has taken a view on a proviso introduced in 2021, which can be interpreted to mean that AY 2017-18 (and prior years) got time barred on March 31, 2024. These reassessment notices (for AYs 2017-18 and prior) are likely to rake up new interpretation issues in the already muddled reassessment provisions,"" said Ashish Mehta, partner at law firm Khaitan & Co.The current situation is similar to the conflict between the Income Tax office and taxpayers in 2021. The reassessment law was amended in April 2021, allowing the tax office to reopen 10-year-old tax returns if the total undisclosed income exceeded Rs 50 lakh and reassess 4-year-old matters if the amount was less than Rs 50 lakh.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? However, this change led to over 10,000 writ petitions being filed by companies, arguing that they were not given sufficient time to explain and that the notices were issued without considering the carve-out that cases which couldn't be reopened earlier couldn't be reassessed under the new law.The Supreme Court invoked its extraordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution on May 4, 2022, to uphold all reassessment notices issued after March 31, 2021. However, the court left room for judicial proceedings based on the merits of each case, and several such matters are currently pending before the court.","The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month.

NPS and EPF: Overlapping services

What is NPS Vatsalaya?

Latest NPS rules, news: In the Union Budget 2024 speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced two new initiatives with regard to National Pension Scheme (NPS) - extension of NPS 14% employer contribution benefits to private setcor and the intended launch of NPS Vatsalya.Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries, bringing it at par with the provisions available for government employees.Sriram Iyer, CEO, HDFC Pension Management told ET that with this move the “ground rules have been harmonised among government and non-government employees, which is a positive step.”Effectively, this means that now, private-sector employees can choose to reduce the taxable portion of employers’ contribution to their NPS corpus, thereby paying less tax and leaving greater funds in their pension deposits.“Employees will benefit from tax savings . More importantly, the 40% increase in contribution will have a significant impact on the terminal value of the retirement corpus,” remarked Iyer. The extended savings will “help in retirement planning, working as an option that is at par with the Provident Fund,” Dinesh Rohira, CEO & Founder, 5nance.com was quoted as saying.Moreover, the endeavour aims to increase NPS penetration by increasing tax incentives for the private sector, providing them a social security-cushion post-retirement.The scheme’s motive to widen the NPS subscriber base may not prove to be flawlessly effective, however. This is explained by Agrees Mrin Agarwal, Founder, Finsafe India: “While it’s good that the limit has been raised, it may not increase adoption as employees need to be educated in a big way. Also, the benefit is only for the salaried opting for the new tax regime,” she says.The mandatory contribution to the EPF, too, threatens to relegate the provisions of NPS under the umbrella of near-superfluity. This sentiment is echoed by Varun Sahay, a software engineer in a Delhi-based IT company: “When 12% of my salary is already deducted for the EPF, why should I put in more in the NPS and cut my take-home pay?”Rohira feels otherwise. “There’s no competition between the NPS and EPF as employees can contribute to both and build a 3-4 times bigger corpus while earning 3-4% higher returns via marketlinked options in the NPS,” he counters.Also Check | New Tax Regime 2023 vs 2024 After Budget: How Much Income Tax Will Salaried Taxpayers Save & How Do New Tax Slabs Compare To Old Regime? Top 10 Points You Must Know To jumpstart retirement savings for children, a new initiative called NPS Vatsalya has been unveiled in the Budget. This scheme allows parents and guardians to contribute to a minor's account, which can be converted into a regular NPS account once the child reaches adulthood.""It provides a very long duration for reaping the compounding benefits and accumulating a huge bounty at a later age. This can be a good way to plan a better future for kids who may not opt for a service segment in the future,"" says Rohira. Sriram Iyer agrees, stating, ""It’s a good move to help the child start his retirement journey. Even if a parent starts when the child is 10 years old, by the time he starts working, it can be a solid foundation for the compounding journey after that.""However, some experts question the utility of a product with such a long lock-in period, especially when parents cannot use the funds for essential goals like their child’s education amidst soaring education costs of 11-12%.""Parents are struggling to save for their own retirement, so it might be a bit of a stretch to expect them to save for their kids’ retirement.

Though the NPS permits partial withdrawals, it allows only 25% of the corpus after three years of joining, and this can be done only three times during the entire tenure. A premature exit before 60 years with 100% withdrawal is only possible if the corpus is less than Rs.2.5 lakh, an amount insufficient for most children's goals.""In its current form, there won’t be any uptake,"" asserts Agarwal. Rohira concurs, ""It’s a vanilla product with a lock-in, which does not make it very attractive and it may not take off. However, the government may optimise it and introduce new features later."" Iyer adds, ""This is just a start and there may be more subscriber-friendly features as we take it to the market.

Gold import duty cut: Why Indians may not find buying gold from Dubai as attractive post Budget 2024,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-import-duty-cut-why-indians-may-not-find-buying-gold-from-dubai-as-attractive-post-budget-2024/articleshow/112097671.cms,"Gold import duty cut in Budget 2024: The recent reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai. Indian jewellers with stores in both India and the UAE believe that the narrowed duty differential will result in lower gold prices in India, making it less attractive for Indians to purchase gold in Dubai.The emirate had attracted gold-enthusiast Indians following a steep rise in customs duty in India in July 2022. In the fiscal 2024-25 budget, the duty on gold imports was more than halved.The duty cut is also expected to boost gold jewellery production in India, particularly the popular 'Kolkatti' jewellery from Kolkata, which is favored by Indian expats in Dubai and tourists from various countries. This move will encourage gold artisans to create new designs in both heavyweight and lightweight jewellery, attracting consumers to purchase gold from India.According to an ET report, Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group , estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India as Indian tourists who previously bought jewellery in Dubai will now prefer to shop in India. However, Indian expats living in Dubai and other customers may continue to buy from the UAE.Also Read | Gold losing sheen? Government cuts gold bond issuance target as investors look at better alternatives Rajiv Popley, director at Popley & Sons, believes that the perception of overseas gold being cheaper than in India is merely a mindset. He points out that the labour cost is significantly lower in India, and with the introduction of mandatory hallmarking and HUID numbers, the purity of gold in India is no longer a concern.Furthermore, NRIs in Dubai do not receive VAT refunds, and Indians travelling abroad only receive about 60% of the VAT back on their gold purchases. Gold trade analyst Bhargav Baidya suggests that the 1% duty differential between gold jewellery in India and Dubai will be offset by Indian jewellers offering discounts to retain and attract customers.Saurabh Gadgil, chairman of PNG Jewellers, notes that Indian import duty is now on par with the US, allowing Indian jewellers to offer competitive prices compared to other countries worldwide. The reduced customs duty is expected to make gold purchases in India more attractive and convenient for Indian consumers, potentially leading to a significant shift in their gold shopping preferences.",The reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai.

Gold losing sheen? The government has reduced its target for issuing gold bonds in the financial year 2024-25 by 38% compared to the previous interim budget goal, according to a senior official. The revised target stands at Rs 18,500 crore, down from Rs 29,638 crore estimated in the interim budget and Rs 26,852 crore (revised estimate) in 2023-24.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told ET ""The decision followed a reassessment of various factors, including investor demand, other investment products and uncertainties around the global economy, as the situation has changed since the interim budget in February.""After accounting for redemptions, the net issuances of sovereign gold bonds are now estimated at Rs 15,000 crore for this fiscal year, a significant decrease from the Rs 26,138 crore projected in the interim budget and Rs 25,352 crore in the revised estimate for 2023-24.Harish Galipelli, director at ILA Commodities India, attributed this shift to retail investors increasingly opting for equities in anticipation of better returns. He also noted that people are uncertain about the potential for further increases in gold prices in the short-to-medium term following a recent rally. Additionally, Galipelli pointed out that savings in rural areas have been impacted by retail inflation and other factors.The gold bond and gold monetisation schemes were introduced by the government in late 2015 to discourage the physical purchase of precious metals and reduce imports, thereby mitigating the negative impact on the current account deficit.The gross collection through these two schemes is now projected to be Rs 20,030 crore in 2024-25, compared to Rs 31,168 crore in the interim budget and Rs 28,240 crore (revised estimate) in the previous fiscal year. Similarly, the net collection is estimated at Rs 16,433 crore, down from Rs 27,571 crore in the interim budget and Rs 26,653 crore in the previous year. However, the estimates for the gold monetisation scheme remain unchanged from the interim budget level.Also Read | Budget 2024: Duty cuts on gold, silver, platinum, and diamonds to make jewellery more affordable The sovereign gold bond scheme targets investors who view gold as an investment, encouraging them to purchase paper gold instead of physical gold.On the other hand, the gold monetisation scheme aims to bring out idle gold held by households, temple trusts, and others to increase domestic supply. Both schemes were designed to curb gold imports, which, along with crude oil, have been significant contributors to India's current account deficit.

The same principle will also apply in case of multiple sellers, where the share of each seller is less than Rs.50 lakh, but the aggregate sale-price of the property is over Rs. 50 lakh.The 1% TDS applies on the purchase price or the stamp duty value, whichever is higher. This amendment proposed in Budget 2024 , comes into effect from October 1.The explanatory memorandum points out that, “Some taxpayers are interpreting that the consideration being paid or credited refers to each individual buyer’s payment rather than the total consideration paid for the immovable property.” The memorandum illustrates that based on this interpretation, if buyers are paying less than Rs. 50 lakh each, no tax is being deducted, even if the purchase value of the immovable property or stamp duty value exceeds Rs. 50 lakh. “This is against the intention of the legislature,” it states.“Accordingly, it is proposed to amend sub-section (2) of section 194-IA of the Act to clarify that where there is more than one transferor (seller) or transferee (buyer) in respect of an immovable property, then such consideration shall be the aggregate of the amounts paid or payable by all the transferees to the transferor or all the transferors for transfer of such immovable property.”Tax experts point out that buyers should be aware of this change as the penalties for not deducting and depositing tax at source are significant. In addition to deducting and depositing the TDS the buyers also have to issue the TDS certificates after generating the same on the I-T department’s e-portal (TRACES).

How to identify whether a mutual fund is regular or direct?

Direct vs Regular mutual funds: Which is better?

Also Read |

In the dynamic world of investing, mutual funds have gained significant traction among those looking to diversify their portfolios and maximise returns. These investment vehicles pool resources from numerous investors with similar financial objectives, allowing for collective investment. Professionally managed and diversified across various asset classes, mutual funds help investors achieve broad diversification.A fund house oversees the corpus, with managers strategically investing in a range of instruments, including equities, government securities, and corporate bonds, in line with the scheme’s goals and risk profile.Investors can choose between two main types of mutual fund plans: direct and regular, each designed to cater to different investor needs and objectives.With direct mutual funds, investors manage their own investments, including asset allocation, portfolio management, and tracking. This approach requires more time and effort as investors need to conduct their own market research, understand fund strategies, and make independent decisions.In contrast, regular mutual funds involve investing through an intermediary who provides additional services. These services include maintaining investment records, assisting with documentation, offering tax proofs, and providing personalised advice. These benefits make regular mutual funds appealing to those who prefer comprehensive support and guidance. For instance, a new investor might choose a regular mutual fund to leverage the expertise of a financial advisor in navigating the market's complexities.While direct mutual funds can save on fees, they might lack the advisory support, advanced tools, and streamlined processes offered by intermediaries. Both direct and regular mutual funds are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), ensuring the same level of protection. The key differences lie in expense ratios and the extent of guidance, which can affect potential returns.Choosing between direct and regular mutual funds significantly influences your investment strategy and outcomes. Understanding the differences in expense ratios, commissions, and overall returns is essential for making an informed decision. If you have a solid grasp of investment strategies and market trends, direct mutual funds might be the better choice, offering greater control and potentially higher returns due to lower expenses.However, if you are new to investing, regular mutual funds managed by financial intermediaries might be a wiser option. Intermediaries provide ongoing support and adjustments to optimise your investment returns, which can be especially valuable for novice investors. Although there may be a nominal fee for these additional services, the benefits of expert guidance and improved returns often outweigh the costs associated with regular mutual funds.","Investors can choose between two main types of mutual fund plans: direct and regular.

"Tourists looking to experience, not just see things",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tourists-looking-to-experience-not-just-see-things/articleshow/112269206.cms,"Niche is the buzzword in tourism circles. Adventure, astro, farm, plantation, wildlife, culture, caravan, cruise. The prefixes for tourism are growing. The demand for experiences tailored to individual aspirations has spawned a host of new ventures.Tamil Nadu received 28.61 crore domestic tourists in 2023, a 33% rise over the previous year, and 11.75 lakh foreign tourists, a 97% increase compared to the previous year.But it’s no more only about visiting temple towns or hill resorts or beach resorts. According to the tourism trade, locals and tourists want standout experiences when they travel.Tourism is already in transition in Tamil Nadu, says Srihari Balan, chairman, tourism, SICCI. “Pre-Covid travellers were stereotypical. It was about booking hotels, sightseeing, and framing an itinerary. Or it was religious tourism. Post-Covid, social media and influencers triggered a boom in tourism. Bikers identified the potential of Kolli Hills, which has 70 hairpin bends. After Covid, many resorts are converting into wellness centres,” he says.Tamil Nadu Tourism Development Corporation (TTDC), for its part, has an ambitious agenda to promote niche tourism. “Farm tourism is one segment, where visitors can enjoy rural culture, food, and festivals. It will generate income and employment for rural residents,” says C Samayamoorthy, TTDC managing director. The tourism department is issuing certificates for bed and breakfast (B&B) homestays, caravan parks, and camping operators, ensuring high standards, he adds.TTDC is also planning to promote astro tourism in view of the growing interest in nature-based tourism. It has commissioned a feasibility report, with an investment of `50 lakh, to identify potential locations and develop plans. And, `1 crore has been allocated to promote water sports activities throughout Tamil Nadu.Measures are also being taken to boost eco and wildlife tourism through targeted social media and digital promotions. The tourism trade is sanguine about the state tapping into these segments. “The Indian adventure tourism market is expected to grow significantly, with a projected market size of `20,000 crores by 2028, growing at a CAGR of 20% from 2021 to 2028. By creating infrastructure and regulating adventure tourism, Tamil Nadu can secure a significant share of this market,” says Swaminathan Subramanian, co-founder, Exoticamp Adventures Private Ltd.By promoting eco-friendly camping practices and developing campsites with minimal environmental footprints, Tamil Nadu can attract eco-conscious domestic and international tourists,” he adds.“Diversifying adventure tourism to include zip-lining in the hill stations, bungee jumping over scenic landscapes, regulated trekking in the Western and Eastern Ghats, and rock climbing on natural cliffs can attract a broader audience,” says Swaminathan.Cruise tourism is another area that has not been tapped into. What is the cruise tourism potential in Tamil Nadu? Jurgen Bailom, president and CEO of Cordelia Cruises, says the state’s strategic location on India’s eastern coast offers excellent opportunities for both domestic and international cruises. “We anticipate a market size of over 300,000 cruise passengers annually within the next five years, driven by increasing interest in experiential travel,” he says. But to be cruise-ready, it needs robust port infrastructure, dedicated cruise terminals, and convenient access to attractions, he adds.Karthik Murali, 38, a data science manager from Chennai who has travelled to 16 countries to date by air, sea, train, and road, says “Money is a secondary concern for travel nowadays. Cruise tourism is popular in Mumbai and Goa. We can tap into the potential we have, and people from neighbouring states will flow in.”Echoing this sentiment, SICCI’s Balan says enhancing infrastructure, relaxing the immigration process for tourists, policies for cruises, scuba diving, and other water sports to encourage more investors, and including representatives from different departments in the tourism committee will change the tourism landscape for Tamil Nadu.","Tamil Nadu received 28.61 crore domestic tourists in 2023, a 33% rise over the previous year.

Tropical storm Debby threatens Florida's Gulf Coast with historic rainfall and major flooding,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/tropical-storm-debby-threatens-floridas-gulf-coast-with-historic-rainfall-and-major-flooding/articleshow/112274490.cms,"Tropical Storm Debby intensified rapidly on Sunday as it approached Florida's Gulf Coast , with meteorologists warning that it could soon escalate to hurricane strength. The storm, churning through the unusually warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico, poses a significant threat of life-threatening storm surge and unprecedented flooding.According to the National Hurricane Center (NHC), Debby is expected to become a hurricane by Sunday night and make landfall in Florida's Big Bend region around midday Monday.The NHC has issued dire warnings of a storm surge reaching six to ten feet (1.8 to 3.0 meters) above ground level in some areas, which could result in severe inundation.Governor Ron DeSantis, during an emergency briefing, emphasized the gravity of the situation. ""We are looking at potentially really, really significant flooding, particularly in north-central Florida,"" he said. He urged residents to complete their final preparations immediately as the storm's impact becomes imminent.As of 5:00 pm EDT, Debby was approximately 120 miles (190 kilometers) west of Tampa, with maximum sustained winds of 65 miles per hour and a northward movement of 12 miles per hour. The storm's intensification is expected to continue, heightening concerns about its potential impact.In anticipation of Debby’s arrival, mandatory evacuations were ordered late Saturday for parts of Citrus County. Additionally, voluntary evacuation orders were issued for eight other counties. Local authorities are stressing the importance of heeding these orders. ""Take the situation seriously,"" advised Paul Hasenmeier, Hernando County fire chief and public safety director. ""We know the water's going to come up as the storm passes.""The NHC forecasts that Debby could bring between six to twelve inches of rain to various parts of Florida, with coastal Georgia and South Carolina potentially receiving 20 to 30 inches by the end of the week. The prospect of ""potentially historic heavy rainfall"" raises fears of severe flash flooding, particularly in areas unaccustomed to such conditions.Governors of both Georgia and South Carolina have declared states of emergency as a precautionary measure. President Joe Biden has also approved an emergency declaration for Florida, facilitating expedited federal aid to support the storm response.DeSantis has activated the state's National Guard, positioning 3,000 service members on standby to assist with emergency operations and recovery efforts. The coordinated response aims to mitigate the impact of what could be a historic weather event.Residents along the Gulf Coast and the southeastern US are urged to remain vigilant and follow local advisories as Tropical Storm Debby continues its perilous path.",Tropical Storm Debby is expected to become a hurricane by Sunday night and make landfall in Florida's Big Bend region around midday Monday.

Japan’s equity benchmarks slid more than 20% from record highs reached last month as investor confidence crumbled from the surge in the yen, tighter monetary policy and the deteriorating economic outlook in the US.The Topix and Nikkei 225 Stock Average tumbled more than 7%, with both set for three-day declines that would be the worst since the 2011 Fukushima nuclear meltdown and push them into bear markets.Circuit breakers suspended trading of futures for both equity benchmarks.Exporters were among the heaviest drags on the Topix after the yen surged more than 2% versus the dollar on the unwinding of carry trades, while banks dropped after yields of 10-year government bonds plunged 13 basis points.“We are basically seeing a mass deleveraging as investors sell assets to fund their losses,” said Kyle Rodda, a senior market analyst at Capital.Com. “The rapidity of the move has caught me off guard; there’s a lot of panic selling now, which is what causes these non-linear reactions in asset prices to pretty straightforward fundamental dynamics.”All 33 of the Topix’s industry groups have fallen since the Bank of Japan raised interest rates on July 31, triggering a surge in the yen that has cast a pall over the earnings outlook for exporters. Yen-funded carry trades were among the most popular in emerging markets as volatility remained low and investors bet Japanese rates would remain at rock bottom.Even insurers and banks that were expected to benefit from higher rates are now some of the biggest losers since the BOJ’s hike as global equity markets slump. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group shares fell as much as 21%, their biggest intraday decline on record, as yields plunged globally following poor US data.“Many people long the weak JPY trades and soft landing scenario are being forced to unwind,” said Rafael Nemet-Nejat a senior portfolio manager at Jin Investment Management Pte. “The moves are extreme especially in crowded longs even if earnings are huge beats, likely indicating that funds are either blowing up and/or experiencing a lot of pain.’Signs of weakness in the US economy sparked a slump on Wall Street on Friday and a plunge in Treasury yields. Nonfarm payrolls rose by 114,000 — one of the weakest prints since the pandemic — and job growth was revised lower in the prior two months. The unemployment rate unexpectedly climbed for a fourth month to 4.3%, triggering a closely watched recession indicator.Once the main drivers of the market’s ascent, foreign investors sold net ¥1.56 trillion ($10.7 billion) Japanese cash equities and futures combined in the week that ended July 26, according to data from Japan Exchange Group Inc.“The latest big selloff in equities, reinforced by US market’s downturn and led by technology stocks, has staged a big reset in terms of expectations for Japan equity returns for the rest of the year,” Andrew Jackson, head of Japan equity strategy at Ortus Advisors Pte in Singapore, wrote in a note.“Although the market is currently in a ‘storm,’ Japanese stocks will gradually find a place to settle down along with the U.S. stock market,” she said. “Selling is being spurred by the unwinding of long positions and the involvement of trend-following hedge funds. Valuation and fundamental strategies are not applicable in some areas due to the panic selling aspect of the market.”“It is too early to tell if the summer heat will abate. But it is certainly a case of a conspiracy of ‘risk off’ triggers. The BOJ from what it did (hike and signal more) and the Fed for it has not (cut and commit to emphatic cutting) are conspiring to undermine precariously rich markets.”“There is a general pattern of a reversal from the previous year’s data and the BOJ is not likely to raise interest rates further and will likely not be possible looking at the pace of the stock prices.”“Until the bottoming out of USD/JPY is confirmed, aggressive buying of Japanese equities is likely to be restrained. At the moment, the US economic surprise index is showing a worsening trend, and investors are becoming increasingly wary of deteriorating US economic indicators.”",Japan’s equity benchmarks slid more than 20% from record highs reached last month.

Panda Bonds: Can Panda bonds solve Pakistan's economic woes?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/can-panda-bonds-solve-pakistans-economic-woes/articleshow/112268055.cms,"Why it matters

NEW DELHI: Pakistan has received five bids from Chinese firms to help raise funds via Panda bonds , marking a significant step as the nation pushes ahead with plans to return to global capital markets. The finance ministry reported three offers from law firms and two from credit rating agencies , alongside interest from two Pakistani firms to act as domestic legal counsels, a Bloomberg report said.Issuing Panda bonds is a strategic move for Pakistan to diversify its funding sources and tap into new investor markets. This comes at a crucial time as Pakistan seeks to stabilize its economy and reduce its dependency on Western financial markets. ""China will support the Panda bond,"" said finance minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, highlighting the importance of this initiative for future fundraising efforts in Europe and the US.The IMF 's $7 billion loan deal provides crucial financial support to Pakistan, reducing external funding risks.This bailout, coupled with the positive credit rating from Fitch , bolsters Pakistan's credibility in issuing Panda bonds and reassures potential investors of the country's financial stability.Fitch has upgraded Pakistan’s credit rating to CCC+ from CCC, citing reduced risks from external funding after the country secured a new $7 billion loan deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). This upgrade, along with S&P's reaffirmation of Pakistan's long-term foreign currency debt rating at CCC+, underscores improved financial confidence. Issuing yuan-denominated debt is part of Pakistan’s broader strategy to manage its fiscal deficit and improve its financial standing.Finance minister Muhammad Aurangzeb emphasized the significance of this move in March, saying that selling Panda bonds will allow Pakistan to ""diversify its funding sources and reach investors in a new market."" The positive feedback from rating agencies has emboldened the government to look ahead to future fundraising globally. “Ultimately we’ll have to get to the euro bonds and we’ll have to get back to the US market,” Aurangzeb said in a video message on Monday.The issuance of Panda bonds by Pakistan not only secures essential financial resources but also strengthens diplomatic ties with China. This move reflects a shared commitment to fostering mutual trust and cooperation. However, analysts caution about the long-term implications of increased debt, particularly regarding China's growing influence in the region and the potential risks associated with debt repayment.Panda bonds, renminbi-denominated bonds issued by non-Chinese entities in China, offer a mechanism for foreign governments and corporations to raise capital from Chinese investors.Dim Sum bonds, also renminbi-denominated, are issued in Hong Kong and cater to foreign investors.The key difference lies in their issuance location and the regulatory environment they adhere to.Pakistan's decision to issue these bonds is part of a strategic effort to stabilize its economy and leverage its relationship with China, its largest trading partner.This initiative also highlights the expanding Chinese bond market, which has grown significantly, providing ample liquidity and opportunities for foreign entities to access a vast pool of capital.The finance ministry is currently evaluating the proposals for Panda bonds before making a final selection.This initiative is expected to attract Chinese investors, leveraging the close economic ties between Pakistan and China.The proceeds from the bonds are anticipated to be used for various purposes, including social services and infrastructure development, which are critical for Pakistan’s economic recovery.(With inputs from agencies)",Pakistan has received five bids from Chinese firms to help raise funds via Panda bonds.

The one-day wipeout is his third-worst, trailing only April 4, 2019, when the Amazon co-founder’s wealth tumbled $36 billion following his divorce settlement, and April 29, 2022, when Amazon shares plunged 14%.The Nasdaq 100 Index fell 2.4%, dragging down the fortunes of other tech billionaires including Elon Musk and Oracle Corp.’s Larry Ellison, whose net worths were pared $6.6 billion and $4.4 billion, respectively. Uncertainty over possible Federal Reserve rate cuts, as well as some high-profile earnings disappointments, have helped plunge the tech-heavy index into correction territory, wiping out more than $2 trillion in value in just over three weeks.Investors have also become jittery over fears that this year’s AI-fueled gains are overdone or the market is too concentrated. The decline in Amazon shares — the biggest drop since April 2022 — came after the company said on an earnings call that it planned to continue spending big on AI even at the expense of short-term profits.Technology billionaires Mark Zuckerberg, Sergey Brin and Larry Page also each lost more than $3 billion Friday as shares of Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet fell in New York trading. Tech tycoons in total saw $68 billion carved from their fortunes, according to Bloomberg’s wealth index.Bezos, 60, the world’s second-richest person, has been steadily offloading Amazon shares this year. He sold stock worth about $8.5 billion over nine trading days in February. And on a day last month when Amazon hit a fresh record, he disclosed a plan to sell 25 million additional shares worth $5 billion.The additional sales would bring his total this year to roughly $13.5 billion, according to Bloomberg’s calculations. He would still hold almost 912 million shares, or about 8.8% of Amazon, once those sales are complete.His wealth also derives from space-exploration company Blue Origin and the Washington Post.","Bezos' net worth shrank by $15.2 billion Friday, leading a wide-ranging slump that erased $134 billion from the fortunes of the 500 richest people in the world.
