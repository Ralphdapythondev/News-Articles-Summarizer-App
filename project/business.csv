Why business curbs are new weapon in RBI armoury,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-business-curbs-are-new-weapon-in-rbi-armoury/articleshow/109607898.cms,"MUMBAI: For big banks , a penalty slapped by RBI for violations had as much impact as a traffic violation fine for a BMW owner. The fine did not impact senior management compensation, the share price did not budge and the penalty was a rounding sum in the bank's balance sheet.In the past, in addition to penalties, at best, RBI tried to tighten the screws by either compounding the offences (fining multiple instances of the same offence) or by holding back on permissions for new activities.But this was a stick that the central bank could not use with all. For instance, card networks had little direct role to play in India.RBI had a bigger challenge in dealing with multinationals in getting them to comply particularly when their operations were limited. This was experienced when RBI introduced norms for local data storage of payment system. After waiting for two years, in April 2021, RBI for the first time used business restrictions as enforcement action barring Mastercard and Diners Club from onboarding new customers until they complied with the norms. On its part, RBI has argued that none of its actions has come without giving the entities time to fix the problems.RBI's actions on business restriction have intensified in the last two years with institutions that were considered ""too big to fail"" facing the restrictions as well. ""In banking circles, the fear these days is whose turn is going to be the next...I mean, the actions in the past six months has been relentless by RBI...It started with HDFC Bank three years ago, Bajaj Auto Finance, Paytm (Payments Bank), IIFL (Finance) and a whole lot of fines imposed on so many banks and NBFCs,"" said Suresh Ganapathy research analyst with Macquarie in a note.According to him, no one would have expected an entity like Kotak Mahindra, which entered the market with techonology as its USP and the affluent middle class as its focus, to face the regulatory ire.Incidentally, most of the compliance issues raised by RBI, whether it is HDFC Bank, Kotak Bank or Bank of Baroda, are technology-related and involve not putting required safety systems in place. Bankers said the reluctance to fix systems is not just because of finances but because management does not want to disturb a ""running engine"". Systems that were cutting edge 20 years ago are now creaking legacy systems and many banks need a strong nudge to fix things they feel are not broken.The other tool that RBI has used to get banks to toe the regulatory line is CEO extensions. According to Ganapathy, RBI has also made it difficult to second guess the regulator on CEO extensions , which also matter a lot when it comes to stock performance.According to an executive with a credit rating agency, RBI has been successful in imposing business restrictions while other regulators have not used is because of the powers it enjoys. ""These powers are required given that in the digital age a bank run can will be difficult to stall."" RBI can not only stop a bank from doing business, it can also change the management and board of a bank. ""Unlike Sebi which has found many of its orders overturned by the Securities Appellate Tribunal, the RBI order are not subject to external review,"" he added.RBI's business restrictions hurts regulated entities in two ways. First, it impacts the entity's top line by reducing business. More importantly, the business restrictions almost immediately result in a fall in valuation which can run into thousands of crores and increase shareholder pressure on the management. ""We believe such restrictions should impact business growth, including KMB's,"" Emkay Finance said in a report.","RBI's actions on business restriction have intensified in the last two years with institutions that were considered ""too big to fail"" facing the restrictions.

Eye on LS polls?

Centre has also permitted the export of another 2,000 tonnes of white onions cultivated specifically for export markets in the Middle East and some European countries.Ministry of consumer affairs said in a statement that National Cooperative Exports Ltd (NCEL), the agency for onion exports to these countries, sourced the domestic produce through an e-platform at L1 (lowest quoted) prices.NCEL has supplied to the agency/agencies nominated by govt of the destination country at the negotiated rate on a 100% advance payment basis.On Dec 8 last year, Centre had banned export of onions to ensure adequate domestic availability, against the backdrop of estimated lower kharif and rabi crops in 2023-24 and increased demand in the international market.Maharashtra deputy CM Devendra Fadnavis turned to social media platform X to thank PM Modi for allowing the exports. He told reporters on Saturday that the opposition, which was unhappy with Centre's decision, ""have now lost an issue to attack the BJP-led central govt. Farmers' issues were never a priority for the opposition"".Union minister and BJP nominee from Dindori, Bharati Pawar said onion farmers heaved a sigh of relief with the announcement. Pawar, who had been criticised by onion farmers in Dindori over the export ban , said ""I believe this is a fresh move by govt to provide relief to farmers."" Dindori has a significant number of voters who are onion cultivators.Nashik BJP functionaries admitted that Centre's announcement has come as a huge relief for the party in Dindori constituency. ""This will help us woo onion farmers, who were a disgruntled lot after the ban was imposed. It had given an advantage to NCP (SCP) nominee Bhaskar Bhagare. We are now confident that things will improve for BJP in the constituency,"" a BJP functionary said.A section of onion traders, however, felt that the quantum allowed for export was ""too less"". Vikas Singh, an onion exporter, said, ""About 48,000 tonnes of onion are exported from Nashik every month. There are other districts in Maharashtra like Ahmednagar from where a lesser amount is exported. I am not hopeful that allowing such a small quantum of export will help in improving wholesale prices at APMCs.""","Maharashtra deputy CM Devendra Fadnavis turned to social media platform X to thank PM Modi for allowing the exports.

"No more OTP frauds? Home Ministry teams up with SBI Cards, telecom operators for innovative solution on stolen one-time passwords",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/no-more-otp-frauds-home-ministry-teams-up-with-sbi-cards-telecom-operators-for-innovative-solution-on-stolen-one-time-passwords/articleshow/109524380.cms,"Crooks on the prowl

No more OTP frauds? India's home ministry, SBI Cards and Payment Services Ltd (SBI Card), and telecom operators are collaborating to create a solution that will alert customers about stolen one-time passwords (OTPs) as part of a larger initiative to address the increasing risk of cyber fraud and phishing attacks on the banking system.According to two individuals familiar with the matter, the government is evaluating a solution that will enable banks to monitor a customer's registered address and the geolocation where an OTP is being delivered.If there is a discrepancy between the two locations, the customer can be notified of a potential phishing attempt, said an ET report. The solution is currently in the testing phase, and the goal is to use the telecom database to track the customer's geolocation and ensure that the OTP is being sent to the correct location.The Reserve Bank of India had advocated for an additional factor of authentication for any digital payment transaction primarily to prevent fraud. However, over time, fraudsters have developed sophisticated capabilities to either steal OTPs by deceiving unsuspecting bank customers or redirect OTPs to their own devices through fraudulent means, rendering the second factor of authentication ineffective in combating cybercrime.If there is a problem with the OTP delivery location, two steps can be taken: either an alert can be displayed on the device, or the OTP can be blocked entirely. While the specifics of the solution are still being developed with telecom companies, a customer's SIM location can be verified in real-time and compared to the geolocation of OTP delivery. Banks also have their own data on customers' residences, so capabilities will need to be developed to triangulate the data in real-time.Also Read | Getting wrong calls from loan recovery agents, unable to link number with bank account? You may have got a recycled mobile number “For instance, the customer lives in Bengaluru and the OTP is getting delivered in some place in Uttar Pradesh where the person has never been or from where the person has not made any calls recently, which means he or she is not traveling to that place; this is a typical red flag scenario,” a banker said.According to the Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (i4C), cyber criminals siphoned off as much as Rs 10,319 crore between April 2021 and December 2023. The majority of the crimes originated in China, Cambodia, and Myanmar and involved non-state actors. Under i4C, the government established the 'Citizen Financial Cyber Fraud Reporting and Management System', which has prevented approximately Rs 1,200 crore in fraudulent transfers from more than 470,000 citizen complaints received until February 2024. In the calendar year 2023, the registry received 1.12 million complaints totaling Rs 7,488 crore in fraudulent transfers.","India's home ministry, SBI Cards and Payment Services Ltd (SBI Card), and telecom operators are collaborating to create a solution that will alert customers about stolen one-time passwords.

Optimistic about long-term growth: HCLTech CEO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/optimistic-about-long-term-growth-hcltech-ceo/articleshow/109676056.cms,"TOI

BENGALURU: HCLTech CEO C Vijayakumar said that although macroeconomic indicators have remained unchanged, he is optimistic about the IT industry’s growth prospects in the mid- to long-term.Unlike some of its peers, HCL’s banking and financial services business emerged as its top-performing vertical, growing 2.8% sequentially and 12.1% year-on-year in constant currency in 2023-24.This growth occurred despite a muted macroeconomic environment, with no pickup in discretionary spending as clients adopted a cautious approach. Its mainstay market, the Americas, grew 4.2% sequentially and 6.8% year-on-year during the same period.“In BFSI , we have taken a few strategic initiatives. We’ve been investing in the wealth and asset management space as a capability, and we have strong partnerships to drive good momentum in that space. The second big bet was on hybrid cloud adoption in financial services. We saw some very good wins and a lot of execution that helped prop up some of these revenues. And the third is insurance. These three areas are contributing to the growth in financial services. And we are positioned as a challenger in a lot of large accounts, where we started small and are scaling up quite nicely,” he toldin a post-earnings interaction on Saturday. HCL added 3 clients to its $100 million portfolio, taking the total count to 22. Its annual bookings stood at $9.7 billion in the 2023-24 financial year, which is a 10.2% growth compared to the year-ago period.Given the subdued macroeconomic indicators and pressure on the demand side, HCLTech projects its revenue growth to be between 3% and 5% in constant currency for the 2024-25 financial year. The company has set a margin guidance of 18% to 19% for the current financial year, mirroring the previous year’s figures. “We have divested the JV with State Street. So, some of that could also impact FY25 performance. So overall, I think, keeping the macro conditions to be like what it was in FY24, that’s what is in the guidance,” Vijayakumar said. However, he didn’t quantify the impact from the JV.NYSE-listed financial services firm State Street has consolidated its operations in India, acquiring a 49% stake in State Street HCL Services, a JV between the global financial services firm and HCL UK, for $170 million. State Street has partnered with HCLTech for more than a decade. The software business grew 2.3% year-on-year in constant currency. The subscription and support revenue has grown to 83.8% in the 2023-24 financial year from 78.8% in the 2022-23 financial year. “You will see ARR (annual recurring revenue) growth slowdown on a year-on-year basis, and the drop sequentially is attributed to decisions we made to discontinue some small parts of our telecom product portfolio,” Vijayakumar said.HCL has launched Tech AI Force, a generative AI and automation platform, to deliver better productivity, ensuring faster release timelines. “There is a lot of interest in generative AI, but the projects are still small. I think more than the projects themselves, the allied work around generative AI is where the biggest opportunity is, which will be in data and both cloud migration and private AI stacks,” he added. The company added 2,725 employees in the March quarter, bringing its total workforce to 2.2 lakh employees. HCLTech onboarded 12,000 freshers, nearing its target of approximately 15,000. For the 2024-25 financial year, the company plans to hire 12,000 freshers, with 10% of the hiring being off-campus. Its IT services voluntary attrition rate is at 12.4%, one of the lowest in the industry.HCLTech has integrated its engineering and R&D (ERD) services sales with IT and business services sales. It has announced role changes for three leaders to amplify its ERD sales capabilities. Kalyan Kumar, who was the chief product officer for the software business and the CTO and head of ecosystems, will now focus on the HCL Software business as the chief product officer. Vijay Guntur, president of its engineering and R&D services, will be its chief technology officer and head of global ecosystems. Hari Sadarahalli will now lead the engineering services business and delivery organization in this expanded role.","HCL’s banking and financial services business emerged as its top-performing vertical.

Sherwanis: Men’s Ethnic Wedding Wear Demand Surges,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/mens-ethnic-wedding-wear-demand-surges/articleshow/109673166.cms,"TOI

New Delhi: It’s all about ‘band, baja and sherwani’ in the men’s apparel market. Sales of men’s traditional wedding wear , including sherwanis , have jumped 25% in the last three years. The rising demand is also spurring competition in the wedding-wear segment, resulting in organised players, including Aditya Birla Fashion, Vedant Fashions and Raymond, scaling up aggressively.“Sherwanis have emerged as a standout category, accounting for over a quarter of all sales.Over the past year, Tasva has seen its business double. Notably, the ‘angrakha’ silhouette has garnered substantial popularity among our customers, contributing significantly to this growth trend,” Ashish Mukul, brand head at Tasva, told. This is majorly because of the rapid retail expansion throughout the country and the introduction of differentiated designs tailored to meet the consumers preferences.Over the last two years, both Aditya Birla Fashion that markets Tasva, and Ethnix of Raymond added about 183 stores combined, with about 94 stores by Vedant Fashions, more popular as Manyavar. Over the next two years, these two brands are likely to add about 300 stores, estimates by I-Sec suggest.The listing success of Vedant Fashions has accelerated competition in the wedding-wear segment from the other branded players, the report said. Aditya Birla Fashion launched Tasva in partnership with the fashion designer Tarun Tahilani in FY22, and Raymond introduced Ethnix in FY19, but started scaling up aggressively from FY22 onwards.Vedant Modi, chief revenue officer, Vedant Fashions, echoes a similar trend. “In the last three years, sales of men’swedding wear , including sherwanis, have grown by approximately 20-25%, indicating a rising demand. This trend underscores the significant role weddings play in driving sales of ethnic wear. The increase in sales is consistent across all types of wedding apparel, showcasing strong market performance and consumer interest in our offerings.The premium segment of wedding wear is experiencing substantial growth, driven by the aspirational nature of weddings. Consumers are opting for higher-quality products for special occasions, driving robust growth in our luxury brand, Twamev.”In FY2023, Indian men’s apparel market was estimated at over Rs 2.2 lakh crore, growing at nearly 10% CAGR from FY2015-2020. The pandemic, however, resulted in a contraction of 3.6% from FY2020-2022. But it is seen to have made a strong recovery and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 18% for the next four years, according to consulting firm Technopak. Ethnic wear accounts for about 6% of the overall men’s wear and is expected to witness a CAGR of nearly 20% over the next four years.An expanding middle class, increase in discretionary spending and consumer demographics are strong growth drivers for the apparel market. Further, the premium segment is experiencing significant growth, in particular, sherwanis.Customers have become increasingly discerning and well-informed about Indian attire, placing greater emphasis on meaningful designs and prioritising comfort alongside luxury. Consequently, brands have effectively tapped into this burgeoning market, by making high-quality designs more accessible to a wider audience, industry experts say.Besides, the other most popular items are kurtas and kurta sets, among ethnic apparel . Strengthening the network and new and competitive offerings are factors leading to the growth. Physical stores remain the primary channel for sales, capturing approximately 90% of the market.","Sherwanis have emerged as a standout category, accounting for over a quarter of all sales.

The finance minister set the stage for a ""Viksit Bharat by 2047"", on the core principles of ‘Sabka Saath’, ‘Sabka Vikas’, ‘Sabka Vishwas’, with ‘Sabka Prayas’ being added as a new theme in the interim Budget.This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data i.e., farmer welfare and N for Nari utthan i.e., support for women entrepreneurs.These form the pillars of a comprehensive inclusive development. The Government's commitment to sustainable development under the strategy for Amrit Kaal includes achieving 'Net Zero' by 2070, rooftop solarization for one crore households and robust health initiatives.The Indian economy's resilience takes center stage amidst positive indicators of declining current account deficit as a percentage of GDP, falling unemployment rates, and a notable rise in digital transactions. These statistics affirm the robustness of the economy, showcasing a trajectory of growth and stability.The achievements in taxation reforms are nothing short of remarkable, with direct tax collections more than trebling in the last decade, the number of tax return filers increasing by 2.4 times, average processing time of tax returns plummeting from 93 days in FY 2013-14 to an impressive 10 days in FY 2023-24, resulting in issuance of quick refunds. These are the results of consistent progressive measures thus obviating the need for, and rightly avoiding, any last-minute populist measures.No change in existing tax rates, both for direct and indirect taxes, is a good indicator of stability and predictability for investors and taxpayers.A welcome move to waive outstanding tax demands that are minor, disputed, and unreconciled. This involves the withdrawal of outstanding direct tax demands up to Rs. 25,000 pertaining to the period up to FY 2009-10 and up to Rs.10,000 for FY 2010-11 to 2014-15.The Government's commitment to fostering a business-friendly environment is evident in its intent to extend specific tax benefits for start-ups, investments by sovereign wealth funds/ pension funds, and certain IFSC units. The extension has been made now until March 31, 2025. This might help in creating a conducive landscape for business.To align with the CBDT notification issued earlier, the provisions relating to tax collection at source concerning remittances under the Liberalized Remittance Scheme have now been formally incorporated in the Finance Bill, 2024, setting the rate at 20% for amounts exceeding Rs. 7 lakhs in a financial year.The Finance Bill, 2024 proposes an extension of the time limit for introducing the faceless scheme by the Central Government for transfer pricing proceedings, DRP Proceedings, and ITAT Proceedings, up to March 31, 2025.The interim Budget 2024 may not have proposed significant tax announcements, but it very well positioned the prelude to the full budget post the upcoming elections. Considering the potential impact on the population across the four pillars of GYAN, a sizable portion of India stands to be covered. The interim Budget’s focus on the tax front resembles a report card, highlighting the maturity achieved by our tax system. The enhancement of taxpayer services was emphasized as a key priority.","This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data and N for Nari utthan.

Interim Budget for a Viksit Bharat: It’s for everyone and all,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/interim-budget-for-a-viksit-bharat-its-for-everyone-and-all/articleshow/107497439.cms,"By Akhilesh Tuteja

The Finance Minister on February 01, 2024, delivered a truly innovative interim budget. At first glance, it did not seem like an interim budget but looked more like the budget to drive further growth and a continuum of inclusive growth-oriented investments.At the outset, this budget brings a wonderful balance between fiscal prudence and continued investment for growth.It's not easy to continue the glide path of reducing the fiscal deficit and continuing to make significant investments in all areas including infrastructure, R&D, energy transition, technology, skilling, and social welfare. The surprising reduction in fiscal deficit of 5.8% as against the budgeted 5.9% for FY24 and the projection of 5.1% in FY25 with a clear focus on increasing investments was a huge positive.This was a budget for everyone and all because it caters to every part of the Indian economy and society. The FM has carefully catered to the investment needs of various sectors. The continued focus on youth, impoverished, women and farmers to increase their involvement and contribution to economic growth is evident. By committing an 11.1% increase in capital expenditure to 11,11,111 lakh crore, the FM has clearly brought every single 1 in this growth journey.What was very impressive was the inclusion strategy of the government. The focus on women's empowerment for the past few years is unprecedented, which is reflected in the inclusion of women in the workforce moving from 23.3% to 37% in the last five years. The thirty crore Mudra Yojna loans to women entrepreneurs were a great boost to the Nari Shakti initiative. We already have over 10 million Lakhpati Didis and what is truly evident is like a corporate CFO, the FM has revised the earlier target of 20 million Lakhpati Didis to 30 million. The government also plans to invest in initiatives to encourage young girls between the ages of 9 and 14 to undertake the vaccination for cervical cancer which is again a great boost to Nari Shakti.A lot needs to be done to bring more women into all parts of economic growth but the journey so far and the vision of the future is truly inspiring.While India continues on its technological prowess and makes its mark in new technologies like Artificial Intelligence, we need a multi-pronged strategy to harness the power of AI. We need a clear focus on building AI systems in India so that we not only emerge as a global leader in this new era but can build models, which are specific to India that will benefit Indians. At the same time, we need a very wide coverage program to build skills to leverage AI to its fullest potential. The biggest contribution we can make to the inclusion of youth in the economic development of the country is by skilling them in new skill areas. In the last few years, the Skill India Mission has trained 14 million youth, reskilled over 5 million youth and established a staggering 3,000 new ITIs. The future of any country will depend as much on capital investments as on skill investments.The focus on agricultural development and support to the farmer continues through direct financial assistance to farmers. The farmers have benefited by getting crop insurance through PM Fasal Bima Yojana. It's not just the farmers, the PM-SVANidhi provides credit assistance to a large number of street vendors.The last few years have seen the journey of affordable housing through Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY). There is a slight increase in allocation to launch a scheme for encouraging the middle class to build or buy new homes. This investment will likely propel a wider economic development and increase employment.India has seen a tremendous rise in entrepreneurship in the last few years. In order to continue the journey and promote new startups, the government proposes to extend certain tax benefits, which are expiring from March 2024 to March 2025. The MSMEs have not been left behind. With a proposal to provide timely finances to such enterprises, the government has paved the way for their growth, so they can look to compete globally.All in all, it’s a truly inclusive budget with a clear focus on development not just by giving away freebies but enabling the people to participate in the economic development activity. While the FM calls the comprehensive GDP - Governance, Development & Performance – to me, this budget is inclusive of another GDP – gender, demography, and professions.","Akhilesh Tuteja is Partner and Head, Clients and Markets, KPMG in India.

‘Enough domestic sources of demand to counter drag from external sector’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/enough-domestic-sources-of-demand-to-counter-drag-from-external-sector/articleshow/107372012.cms,"Do you think the

creates room for lower interest rates?

One of the issues that the Budget has flagged is the demographic challenge and opportunity and the societal change that is taking place. How do you view this?

Niti Aayog is working on the Viksit Bharat roadmap. What will be the focus areas?

You are as much a representative of the Centre as well as the states. Is it time to revisit the entire formula for transfers to states particularly on the issue of cesses and surcharges?

Suman Bery , who heads Niti Aayog , the govt think tank, is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China, which he says is also an opportunity for India. The economist is confident that Indian states remain resilient. Excerpts of the interview with TOI.The finance ministry expects the economy to grow 7% next year.Given the global situation, how do you see the prospects?The belief in the finance ministry is that we have a possible drag coming from the external sector but that we have other sources. We have enough domestic sources of demand. One has to applaud the political and economic judgment of FM in deciding that it was appropriate to pursue the path of fiscal consolidation. There is transparency. What this actually reflects is responsible economic management, which is one reason we are where we are. Second, it also creates a buffer so that there is policy space if we do encounter headwinds.That’s the hope and expectation. We have an independent central bank and an inflation targeting central bank, so it is up to the monetary policy committee to take a call through the monetary policy committee on the repo rate .The PM has said that when India grows its states grow. India is a composite of 37 states and UTs. They are each at very different points in their demographic transition. There are some states where the net replacement rate is down to 1%, like Kerala . There are others, particularly UP and Bihar, which are in their earliest stage of demographic transition and each one of these states is the size of a large European country. There are two implications of that — one is internal labour mobility and it will become an even larger part of our growth model. The govt has taken several steps to create a unified market. Our main endowment is our human capital and that has to be equipped to participate in global exchange in many ways. We know from China, Japan that the demographic dividend partly depends on markets and on human capital. But the golden period is fairly short lived, about 15 years, when the so called dependency ratio declines. The other big opportunity the PM has been highlighting is bringing women much more into the active labour force.When Niti was set up there was the idea of a three-year vision and a seven-year strategy paper. The reality is that schemes of govt tend to be aligned with the award of the Finance Commission . There are various established building blocks or hand holds which are already a matter of govt policy. The PM is much more interested in a national debate on what it means to be a Viksit Bharat or modern society. We have a collective goal and it is for the democratic polity to define what that goal should be. Its emphatically not for a super mandarin bureaucracy. It is not going to be Lee Kwan Yew’s Singapore led from the top.It’s entirely a finance ministry matter but I would be lying if I didn’t say when I visit certain states there is this complaint. A big frontier would be resource mobilisation at the state level. Second is going to be rationalisation of subsidies not only at the Union level, but also at the state level. All chief ministers sit on my governing council. When they convene as the governing council, I see them in their role as development practitioners. The world is beginning to appreciate quite how much institutional and political maturity India attained in our 75 years and the most fundamental dimension of a democracy, we have orderly transfers of power. There are enough buffers to ensure that what happens in state finances is unlikely to create macro instability. Those risks are well contained by our Constitution. The chief ministers know that they are going to be judged by development outcomes and so you can have the sugar rush of changing of pension plans or various handouts but if the cupboard is bare you are not going to be able to deliver.","Suman Bery is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China.

Government's Marathon to 2047: Emphasis on Fiscal Prudence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/governments-marathon-to-2047-emphasis-on-fiscal-prudence/articleshow/107371788.cms,"What was the thinking behind keeping the vote on account absolutely straight?

So is it the idea to keep the Budget completely transparent?

The capex has risen 11.1% and there is an emphasis on infrastructure spending. But there is also the hope that the private sector will now take over and start capital spending. Given the geopolitical situation, how confident is the govt that it will pan out as planned?

Finance secretary T V Somanathan, in an interview with TOI, says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047 . Excerpts:If you see the Budget speech you will see the emphasis on 2047. The govt has set its sight on running that marathon.Running to 2047 is a marathon , it’s not a sprint. If you are going to run a marathon, you need to be in good shape and you can’t have short-term stimulants or something that will get you some yards and then it’s done.The whole focus is on making India a developed country by 2047, for which a healthy present and a strong fiscal position is an important concomitant. Some purely short term measures don’t really fit into that picture. It’s a consistent picture: focus on the long term for which you need to build strength in the short term and that needs to be done by prudence in fiscal policy and by not doing things which can detract you from that path. Not doing the wrong thing is more important than appearing to do things.The idea is that govt finances may be good, bad or indifferent depending on the times, depending on the circumstances, depending on the policies. But what is the position should be reflected as reasonably and accurately as possible. That is an emphasis. As regards the Finance Commission, again the terms of reference that have been given to them are the terms in the Constitution.What is the means by which the devolution should be done is a matter they have full discretion. They can actually take all kinds of factors into account and in a sense we felt this time based on my review of the previous commissions that the right expression would be less is more. The shorter, less prescriptive terms of reference gives full scope for all stakeholders including state govts to express their viewpoints and for the commission to take a balanced view of the different perspectives and then come to its award. Ultimately the award of the Finance Commission is about devolution and grant for which full scope has now been given to them.n There are incipient signs of private capital expenditure accelerating. There are some surveys I have seen done by some of the chambers industry, which show high levels of investment. The PMI, which is a sort of leading indicator, is also looking pretty healthy. Capacity utilisation is one reason that private sector capital expenditure doesn’t immediately pick up when the economy starts accelerating because there is surplus capacity.But increasingly I get the sense that many industries are beginning to reach levels where they have to add capacity. When that happens capital investment will happen. Another pointer also mentioned in the Budget speech you may notice that our airlines have placed large orders for planes — that is capital expenditure.When you import 1,000 aircraft, it’s just not 1,000 aircraft, there are concomitant additions to ground handling facilities, you need airports to expand, you need to employ people to do that. That means a lot of jobs. The aircraft is capital but then look at the effect it is going to have on skilled jobs. So capital expenditure is happening. I am fairly confident that we will have decent capital expenditure in the year to come and that will become a new source of acceleration.",Finance secretary T V Somanathan says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047.

Income Tax Changes Budget 2024 : In the recent Budget 2024 speech, the Finance Minister kept the Section 80C tax deduction limit unchanged. The maximum limit for claiming tax benefits under Section 80C remains at Rs 1.5 lakh for the current fiscal year 2023-24 and will stay the same for individuals looking to save on taxes through Section 80C investments in the upcoming fiscal year 2024-25.Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions. Individuals can reduce their gross taxable income by up to Rs 1.5 lakh per financial year by engaging in these specific investments or expenditures.You can save on taxes through Section 80C by investing in things like Employees' Provident Fund (EPF), Public Provident Fund (PPF), Equity Linked Saving Scheme (ELSS) mutual funds, National Savings Certificate (NSC), and 5-year tax-saving fixed deposits with banks or post offices. Additionally, paying life insurance policy premiums also qualifies for tax benefits under Section 80C.It is important to note that each eligible investment comes with its specific maximum limit, rate of return, liquidity, and taxation rules for the earned returns, states ET in a report. For instance, the most you can invest in PPF in a financial year is Rs 1.5 lakh. Meanwhile, there's no limit on the amount you can invest in ELSS mutual funds, but the Section 80C deduction is capped at Rs 1.5 lakh.If individuals can't make specific investments, they can still get deductions under Section 80C from their gross taxable income through certain expenses. These expenses include repaying the principal amount of a home loan, tuition fees for children, payment of stamp duty, registration fees, and other costs related to buying a house.Since the financial year 2020-21, individuals without any business income must annually choose between the old and new tax regimes. As of the fiscal year 2023-24, the new tax regime is the default option. Consequently, individuals seeking tax deductions under Section 80C must opt for the old tax regime since this deduction isn't available in the new tax regime. It's crucial for taxpayers to be aware of these rules to make informed decisions about their tax planning and investment strategies.","Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget which is an interim budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year. The budget talks about inclusive development both, social and geographical, especially for youth, women, farmers, and the poor. Continued focus on improving logistics through infrastructure spend on roads, rail, airports, ports increases productivity for companies and citizens alike.To make ‘Viksit Bharat’ by 2047, the government’s focus is on improving and empowering people’s capabilities through various skilling initiatives. It is encouraging to see that Skill India Mission has succeeded in training more than 1.4 crore youth and upskilling and reskilling 54 lakh youth. I am particularly happy to see the continued focus on youth and women entrepreneurship and the announcement of a new fund which will give interest free 50 year loans for startups will provide a domestic fillip to startups supplementing venture capital we have traditionally relied on from abroad.PM Mudra Yojana has sanctioned 43 crore loans aggregating to 22.5 lakh crore to youth entrepreneurs and thirty crore Mudra Yojana loans to women entrepreneurs. There are several other schemes like Fund of Funds, Start-Up India, and Start-Up Credit Guarantee schemes that are assisting our youth. Further, the extension of tax benefits to Start-ups and investments made by sovereign wealth funds/pension funds, till 31st March 2025 depicts the government’s effort to support the startup eco- system.This aligns quite well with India Sanitation Coalition’s efforts to give impetus to the start-up world. Over the past 7 editions of our ISC-FICCI Sanitation Awards, we have recognized and promoted several start-ups in the sanitation space, many of whom are successful businesses now!While the finance minister did not provide detailed information on Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH), the budget allocation sees a slight increase in spend demonstrating continued focus on this highly successful program. The acknowledgement that the private sector has increasingly played a substantial role in addressing WASH issues in both urban and rural areas, with numerous projects underway through Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs), highlights the government's commitment to addressing challenges in this sector.A perfect example is the LightHouse Initiative initiated by the Department of Drinking Water along with the India Sanitation Coalition (ISC) by partnering with major corporates across India to develop model villages in Solid and Liquid Waste Management (SLWM) under SBM-Grameen. From this budget, there is an expectation that the government will persist in prioritizing Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) as the path toward achieving the country's Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6). Additionally, it is hoped that the government will uphold its commitment to making necessary infrastructural investments for SLWM.The budget speech rightly celebrates the fact that we have 83 lakh SHGs and 9 crore women beneficiaries. The microfinance movement in the country and the possibility of empowering women members of SHGs through livelihood skilling is a key to bringing women into mainstream economic advancement.The focus on green growth, rooftop solar, wind, biomass, e-vehicles all help with our green energy thrust. The tourism sector was mentioned and could be a huge job provider for youth and women.Guided by the principle ‘Reform, Perform, and Transform’, the budget emphasizes efficient implementation of various policies by improving coordination with states and relevant stakeholders. This is critical both for infra spend and social programsIt is noteworthy that ISC’s Climate Resilient Coastal Cities project which is being implemented in PPP (Public-Private Partnership) mode in four coastal states of Karnataka, Gujarat, Goa and Maharashtra is congruent with the government’s priority of promoting climate-resilient activities for the blue economy 2.0, a scheme for restoration and adaptation measures, and coastal aquaculture.The budget also focuses on the Aspirational districts program where assistance will be given to the states for faster development of aspirational districts and blocks, including the generation of ample economic opportunities.

Private banks grapple with rising IT expenses amid surge in transactions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/private-banks-grapple-with-rising-it-expenses-amid-surge-in-transactions/articleshow/109674303.cms,"NEW DELHI: Private banks are experiencing a significant increase in information technology expenses as most transactions are now conducted digitally. Unlike the one-time capital expenses incurred when they migrated to core banking, IT is now becoming a recurring cost accounting for up to 10% of operating expenses.Bankers have responded to queries about their level of IT capabilities in light of the RBI action on Kotak Mahindra Bank freezing digital onboarding and issuing credit cards.They said that investments in IT capability are a continuous process and cannot be considered as done and dusted.Previously, technology mainly replicated manual tasks. Now, investments cover various areas, such as handling billions of monthly transactions across channels, enabling integration with other businesses and services, leveraging analytics for targeted sales, and employing artificial intelligence for customer service without human involvement.The scale-up in the use of technology is an area of concern for the Reserve Bank of India, which wants to ensure that banks have made the necessary investments in systems to handle the volume, protect against fraud, and have a backup.“Our IT and cybersecurity spending as a percentage of overall spending between 2019 and the current fiscal year has moved up from 5.6% to about 9.4%,” said Sandeep Batra, Executive Director of ICICI Bank, in an earnings call after the bank’s results. The bank said thattechnology spending would continue to grow at a faster pace than overall expenses, but the rate of growth of tech expenses, given the large pace, would moderate.Bankers said that the issues cited by RBI in the case of Kotak - managing IT equipment, updating software, controlling user access, vendor risk management, and data security strategy - are part of the RBI’s checklist in supervision. “These are issues that have to be constantly addressed. A bank cannot say that it has addressed the issues once and for all.”According to Sumant Kathpalia, MD & CEO of IndusInd Bank, the bank spends 8-10% of its total expenditure on information technology. He added that the private lender has a board-level committee that is constantly evaluating its technology capabilities.Yes Bank said that its IT expenditure has gone up 17% to Rs 1108 crore in FY24, which is almost 30% of what the bank spends on staff expenditure. The expenditure includes the opex spend as well as depreciation. “About 10% of our operating costs are coming from technology, and we are conscious of making sure that we keep investing in technology, information security, and infrastructure for our future scale,” a bank official said.Subrat Mohanty, Executive Director in charge of banking operations at Axis Bank, said that the bank has made investments to handle the surge in digital transactions while ensuring system resilience and data security. “This is a constant kind of work that we have been at for the last three to four years. And fundamentally, this requires a very strong and new-gen technology architecture, which separates the core banking system from the middleware, and then middleware from the frontend systems where most of the transactions are happening, which we have done,” he said.","Private banks are experiencing a significant increase in information technology expenses as most transactions are now conducted digitally.

This has been almost exhausted after the spate of investments that came in.India, which had previously failed to get any credible proposals for semiconductor manufacturing after trying for decades, finally managed to score big after American Micron emerged as the first major player to enter the space with a Rs 22,500-crore testing and packaging unit in Gujarat in June last year.This was followed up with approval to three proposals worth nearly Rs 1.3 lakh crore in Feb this year. These comprise: Rs 91,000-crore project of Tata Electronics to set up India’s first semiconductor fab unit with Taiwanese Powerchip Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp at Dholera in Gujarat; Rs 27,000-crore Semiconductor Assembly and Test (TSAT) unit by Tata in Morigaon, Assam; and Rs 7,600-crore project of CG Power with Japanese Renesas Electronics and Stars Microelectronics of Thailand.Govt has now received new proposals which are at a very advanced stage of discussions. These include a display fab unit proposal – the country’s first – by Japanese Sharp that can see investments of up to Rs 40,000 crore. There is also a Rs 90,000 crore plan of Israel’s chipmaker Tower Semiconductors for investments in India.“The proposals need urgent solutions, especially as the companies want clarity from govt on incentive support,” the source added.","Government is looking at rolling out a fresh multi-billion-dollar incentive package for semiconductor companies.

China's share in India's industrial goods imports jump to 30% from 21% in last 15 years: GTRI,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/chinas-share-in-indias-industrial-goods-imports-jump-to-30-from-21-in-last-15-years-gtri/articleshow/109666106.cms,"NEW DELHI: A recent report by the economic think tank Global Trade Research Initiative ( GTRI ) highlights India's rising reliance on Chinese industrial products like telecom, machinery, and electronics. Over the past 15 years, Beijing's share in New Delhi's imports of these goods has increased from 21% to 30%. This growing trade deficit with China raises concerns, with significant implications for both economic stability and national security.From 2019 to 2024, India's exports to China have stagnated at around USD 16 billion annually, while imports from China have surged from USD 70.3 billion in 2018-19 to over USD 101 billion in 2023-24, resulting in a cumulative trade deficit exceeding USD 387 billion over five years.Ajay Srivastava, founder of GTRI, emphasized the need for the Indian government and industries to reassess their import strategies. He suggested fostering diversified and resilient supply chains to mitigate economic risks. This, he stressed, would not only support domestic industries but also reduce dependency on single-country imports, particularly from geopolitical competitors like China.""Over the last 15 years, China's share in India's industrial product imports has increased significantly, from 21 per cent to 30 per cent.""This growth in imports from China has been much faster than India's overall import growth, with China's exports to India growing 2.3 times faster than India's total imports from all other countries,"" the report said.In the fiscal year 2023-24, India's total merchandise imports reached USD 677.2 billion, with China contributing USD 101.8 billion. This indicates that China constituted 15% of India's overall imports. Of these imports from China, USD 100 billion, equivalent to 98.5%, comprised major industrial product categories.""When compared to India's global imports of these industrial products, which total USD 337 billion, China's contribution is quite significant, representing 30 per cent of India's imports in this sector. Fifteen years ago, China's share was just 21 per cent,"" it added.New Delhi's growing dependence is particularly notable in key sectors such as electronics, telecom, electrical products, machinery, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, iron, steel, base metals, plastics, textiles, clothing, automobiles, medical supplies, leather goods, paper, glass, ships, aircraft, and other remaining categories. From April to January in the fiscal year 2023-24, the electronics, telecom, and electrical products sector witnessed the highest import value, totaling USD 67.8 billion, with China accounting for USD 26.1 billion of that amount.""This represents a substantial 38.4 per cent of the total imports in this category, indicating a heavy dependence on Chinese electronic goods and components,"" it said.In the machinery sector, China's contribution amounts to USD 19 billion, representing 39.6% of India's imports in this category. This underscores China's significant role as a machinery supplier to India, noted Srivastava.India's chemical and pharmaceutical imports totaled USD 54.1 billion during the period, with China accounting for USD 15.8 billion, or 29.2%. This highlights China's importance as a provider of chemical and pharmaceutical products to India.Similarly, in the plastics and related articles sector, total imports amount to USD 18.5 billion, with China supplying goods worth USD 4.8 billion, comprising 25.8% of total imports in this sector.Srivastava also highlighted that half of India's imports from China consist of capital goods and machinery, emphasizing the critical need for focused research and development in this area.He emphasized the urgency of upgrading industries related to intermediate goods like organic chemicals, APIs (Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients), and plastics, which constitute 37% of imports. Meanwhile, consumer goods account for 12% of imports, with raw materials representing less than 1%.The report highlighted that numerous products imported from China, including textiles, apparel, glassware, furniture, paper, shoes, and toys, belong to categories dominated by micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs). It suggested that many of these items could potentially be manufactured domestically.""Overall, India imports a broad array of products from China, from high to low technology items, highlighting significant gaps in India's industrial capabilities across various sectors,"" it added.Chinese companies have significant involvement in India's energy, telecommunications, and transportation sectors, playing vital roles in areas such as smartphones, electronics, electric and passenger vehicles, solar energy, and engineering projects. According to the report, while imports were previously conducted by Indian firms, the entry of Chinese companies into the Indian market is expected to lead to a rapid increase in industrial product imports.""As the Chinese firms operating in India will prefer sourcing most requirements from their parent firms, Indian imports will rise sharply. For example, in the next few years, every third electric vehicle (EV) and many passenger and commercial vehicles on Indian roads could be those made by Chinese firms in India alone or through joint ventures with Indian firms,"" the report said.The large-scale entry of Chinese automakers into India will impact the domestic auto/EV manufacturers, firms working in the EV value chain space and battery development, it added.","A recent report by the economic think tank Global Trade Research Initiative ( GTRI ) highlights India's rising reliance on Chinese industrial products. Over the past 15 years, Beijing's share in New Delhi's imports of these goods has increased from 21% to 30%. This growing trade deficit with China raises concerns, with significant implications for economic stability and national security.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109666093,imgsize-1172377,width-400,resizemode-4/109666093.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Tesla CEO Elon Musk arrived in China on Sunday on a surprise visit to the country, which is also the second biggest market of the electric vehicle giant, the Chinese state broadcaster reported. This is his second visit to Beijing within a year.This also comes days after he postponed his visit to India citing ""Tesla obligations"". He was scheduled to meet with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and announce plans to enter the Indian market.According to China broadcaster, Musk's visit was at the invitation of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, where he engaged in discussions with Ren Hongbin, the council's head, to explore further collaboration opportunities and other pertinent topics.Tesla's presence in China has significantly expanded in recent years, with the company establishing a robust foothold in the country's rapidly growing electric vehicle sector. Despite Musk's controversial reputation in the West, Tesla's electric vehicles have gained popularity among China's middle-class urban demographic.Musk's visit coincides with a heated price war among industry players striving to gain an edge in the fiercely competitive EV market. This dynamic environment is further highlighted by the ongoing Beijing auto show, where automotive innovations and market strategies are showcased.Last year, China's domestic automotive giant BYD surpassed Tesla as the world's leading seller of electric vehicles during the fourth quarter. While Tesla regained its top position in the first quarter of this year, BYD continues to dominate the Chinese market, emphasizing the significance of local competition amidst global industry players.Tesla has yet to provide official confirmation or details regarding Musk's visit to China, despite earlier requests for comment from international media outlets.","Tesla CEO Elon Musk arrived in China on Sunday on a surprise visit to the country.

As a result, Republic Bank's 32 branches are set to reopen as branches of Fulton Bank starting as early as Saturday. The FDIC also announced that depositors of Republic First Bank will be able to access their funds through checks or ATMs as soon as Friday night.The failure of the bank is projected to incur a cost of $667 million for the deposit insurance fund . This marks the first instance of an FDIC-insured institution failing in the US this year. The previous bank failure occurred in November, involving Citizens Bank based in Sac City, Iowa. Typically, in a robust economy, an average of only four or five banks close each year.Last month, an investor group led by Steven Mnuchin, the former US treasury secretary under the Trump administration, reached an agreement to inject over $1 billion into New York community Bancorp.

"'Get used to living frugally': China asks officials to use own cup, travel by bike",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/get-used-to-living-frugally-china-asks-officials-to-use-own-cup-travel-by-bike/articleshow/109640681.cms,"Drastic measures in everyday governance

China’s economy is battling a barrage of challenges, including a deepening housing slump, fears of a deflationary spiral and high levels of youth unemployment. As China grapples with a myriad of economic challenges , the government is taking significant steps to tighten its belt, particularly among public officials. Amid concerns of an economic slowdown, soaring debt levels, and faltering consumer confidence, China is now enforcing a frugal lifestyle on its public servants in an effort to redirect resources toward more critical areas of need.In response to economic distress, characterized by a $2 trillion loss in stock market value since 2022 and debt levels nearing three times the national economic output, Chinese authorities have initiated widespread budget cuts across provincial governments.For instance, the governor of Guizhou province has pledged to slash his administration’s operating expenses by 15%. Similarly, in Hunan, officials are urged to embody the spirit of ""red housekeepers,"" a term coined to inspire cost-efficient governance that honors the Communist Party's revolutionary roots, a Wall Street Journal report said.The campaign for frugality has resulted in various stringent measures aimed at curbing unnecessary spending. In Yunnan, for instance, a directive has been issued to set air conditioning thermostats no lower than 26 degrees Celsius (79 degrees Fahrenheit) during summer to save on electricity costs. Meanwhile, in Inner Mongolia, authorities are promoting the repair and reuse of office equipment like desks and chairs instead of purchasing new ones.As per the WSJ report, in recent weeks, numerous local governments have rolled out comprehensive guidelines on how to ""get used to living frugally."" These directives instruct staff to economize by utilizing public transport, opting for less expensive stationery, and printing documents in black-and-white and on both sides of the paper. Additional measures include directives for bureaucrats to consume all their food, reduce work-related travel, and extend the lifespan of resources by repairing and reusing everything from official vehicles to office furniture.At a state-owned ironworks in Yunnan, party officials have called for a 30% reduction in annual drinking water expenses compared to last year's expenditure of 270,000 yuan. The plant's party committee issued a directive saying, “Strictly control the consumption of bottled water in each work unit,” and encouraged employees to use their own cups instead of disposable ones to further cut costs, the WSJ report said.These austerity measures are part of a broader strategy to manage the economic fallout from three years of stringent Covid-19 containment measures and a slumping property market, which have severely depleted local government coffers. This fiscal tightening is further compounded by the reduction in land-sale revenues—a key source of income for many localities.The frugality campaign aligns with Chinese leader Xi Jinping 's broader efforts initiated in 2019 to curb government waste. This campaign not only seeks to alleviate fiscal pressures but also serves a significant political purpose, signaling the government's commitment to sharing the burden of economic slowdown. Senior officials and state media have bolstered this message, appealing to public servants' patriotism and framing frugality as a virtue that aligns with the Communist Party’s values. Historical references to past leaders' simple lifestyles are frequently invoked to strengthen this narrative.Despite these efforts, some experts, like Christine Wong, a visiting professor at the National University of Singapore’s East Asian Institute, view these measures as largely symbolic. They argue that the savings from such cuts are relatively minor compared to the broader challenges facing the Chinese economy, such as the need for substantial reforms in local government revenue generation and debt management. Critics contend that while these frugal measures may yield some savings, they do little to address the underlying structural issues that threaten China's long-term economic stability, the WSJ report said.(With inputs from agencies)",China is enforcing a frugal lifestyle on its public servants in an effort to redirect resources toward more critical areas of need.

The agency is concerned as to whether the company’s remedy was sufficient, in part due to 20 crashes that have occurred involving vehicles that received Tesla’s over-the-air software update .More than 2 million Tesla vehicles are subject to the probe, according to NHTSA . The carmaker’s shares fell as much as 1.7% shortly after the start of regular trading and are down more than 30% this year.The investigation cuts against Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk ’s exuberance about Tesla’s automated-driving systems . The billionaire has set a date in August to unveil a driverless robotaxi, which he said five years ago would be ready by 2020. During an earnings call this week, he downplayed the difficulty of getting the green light from regulators for that vehicle.“I actually do not think that there will be significant regulatory barriers, provided there is conclusive data that the autonomous car is safer than a human-driven car,” Musk said. Later in the call, he said that those who doubt Tesla’s ability to “solve” autonomy shouldn’t invest in the company.Tesla filed its Autopilot recall in December to address concerns NHTSA raised as part of a years-long defect investigation. A portion of the company’s remedy both requires car owners to opt in and allows drivers to readily reverse changes Tesla has made, according to the agency.The carmaker also has deployed Autopilot updates separate from the one disclosed in its December recall that appear to be related to concerns NHTSA had raised as part of its defect probe , the agency said. The latest query will consider why these updates weren’t a part of the recall, NHTSA said.Tesla has taken heat before from NHTSA over deploying software updates to Autopilot without filing a recall.

NEW DELHI: Google 's parent company Alphabet on Thursday announced its first-ever dividend and a $70 billion stock buyback , leading to the stock surge of nearly 16% after the bell. The dividend will be 20 cents per share.Alphabet is returning capital while spending billions of dollars on data centres to compete with rivals on generative artificial intelligence (AI).Alphabet's Big Tech rival, Meta Platforms , three months ago, announced its own first-ever dividend, a move that spiralled the social media company's stock market value by $196 billion the following day.Amazon.com remains the lone holdout among Big Tech firms not offering a dividend.Alphabet beat expectations for the quarter in sales, profit and advertising - metrics that are all closely watched.""Alphabet's announced dividend payouts and buybacks on top of the solid earnings beat are not only a breath of fresh air for the tech market as a whole, but also a very intelligent strategy for the search engine giant going into a tough time of the year,"" said Thomas Monteiro, senior analyst at Investing.com.Alphabet's after-hours share surge of nearly 16% following the report increased its stock market value by about $300 billion to over $2 trillion.In a call to discuss results, CEO Sundar Pichai touted Google's AI offerings as a boon to its core search results. ""We are encouraged that we are seeing an increase in search usage among people who are using the AI overviews,"" he said.Revenue was $80.54 billion for the quarter ended March 31, compared with estimates of $78.59 billion, according to LSEG data.The search firm exceeded expectations for first-quarter revenue due to increased demand for its cloud services driven by the growing use of artificial intelligence and consistent advertising expenditure.Google stated that advertising increased by 13% in the quarter to $61.7 billion. This amount is compared to the average estimate of $60.2 billion, as per LSEG data.Alphabet had a disappointing fourth quarter where advertising sales fell short, leading to a drop in share prices, due to increased competition from companies such as Facebook and emerging platforms like TikTok.TikTok is uncertain about its future following US President Joe Biden 's approval of a bill that could result in a ban on the app if it is not sold within the next nine to 12 months.Meanwhile, revenue from Google Cloud increased by 28% in the initial quarter, driven by a surge in generative artificial intelligence tools that depend on cloud services to provide the technology to clients.Google's cloud services are appealing to startups backed by venture capital that are working on generative AI technologies because of the pricing and seamless integration with other tools, as mentioned by investors and experts in the past.",Alphabet is returning capital while spending billions of dollars on data centres.

'Impending market plunge: Top strategist forecasts 44% S&P 500 crash',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/impending-market-plunge-top-strategist-forecasts-44-sp-500-crash/articleshow/109592631.cms,"NEW DELHI: Paul Dietrich , the chief investment strategist at B Riley Wealth Management , has issued a stark warning that the S&P 500 could plummet by 44 per cent to approximately 2,800 points—a level last seen during the peak of the pandemic in 2020. Dietrich, who has a history of moving his clients' investments from stocks to safer assets like bonds and gold ahead of major market downturns, argues that such preemptive shifts could shield investors from severe financial losses.In his April market commentary, Dietrich recalled how his strategic moves helped his clients avoid the worst impacts of previous market crashes, such as the dot-com bubble burst in 2000 and the 2008 housing crisis.By exiting stocks early, his clients missed the immediate subsequent gains but more crucially avoided the dramatic falls. For instance, during the 2000-2002 recession, while the S&P and Nasdaq plummeted by 49% and 78% respectively, Dietrich’s clients saw a net gain of 7 per cent before fees, a report in Insider said.Drawing parallels with past market conditions, Dietrich highlighted several indicators suggesting an impending downturn. He pointed to ""wildly overvalued"" stock valuations , historical data showing average declines of 36 per cent in past recessions, and various economic signals flashing red, including a spike in the so-called Buffett Indicator and record high gold prices.Despite these ominous signs, Dietrich noted that the predicted recession has been delayed due to significant government spending, consumer debt accumulation, and a tight labor market showing early signs of stress. He remains cautious, forecasting a mild US recession this year, exacerbated by high interest rates and ongoing global economic pressures, the Insider report said.While some of Wall Street’s leading figures, like JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon and Goldman Sachs' David Solomon, have echoed concerns about underestimating market risks, legendary investors like Warren Buffett have historically advised against trying to time the market. Buffett advocates for consistent investment strategies like dollar-cost averaging as opposed to reactionary selling and buying based on market predictions.Dietrich’s warnings invite skepticism, especially considering the stock market’s resilience in recent years against numerous dire forecasts. Nevertheless, his track record and detailed analysis present a cautionary tale for investors about the potential for significant market corrections in the near future.","Paul Dietrich, the chief investment strategist at B Riley Wealth Management, has issued a stark warning that the S&P 500 could plummet by 44 per cent to approximately 2,800 points.
