They highlighted ongoing investment monetization and identified new energy cash flow streams set to begin by the end of 2024 as the next significant event to watch.

Infosys & Wipro see sharp decline in number of employees earning over Rs 1 crore,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/infosys-wipro-see-sharp-decline-in-number-of-employees-earning-over-rs-1-crore-heres-why/articleshow/111275702.cms,"Paycheck at IT companies

Number of crorepati employees at Indian IT companies dips! The number of employees earning over Rs 1 crore at India's leading IT companies, Infosys and Wipro , has significantly decreased over the past two fiscal years. This decline is attributed to the slowdown in demand for technology services following the pandemic.The post-pandemic surge in demand for digital services had initially led to a fierce talent war, with companies like Infosys, Wipro, TCS, and HCLTech offering substantial salary increases to attract the best talent.However, this talent war quickly subsided due to global macroeconomic uncertainty and geopolitical tensions.According to an ET report, Infosys experienced a nearly 16% reduction in crorepati employees, with the number dropping from 123 in FY22 to 103 at the end of FY24. Similarly, Wipro saw a 12% decrease, with the number of crorepati employees falling from 92 in FY22 to 81 in FY24.Industry experts believe that this decline in high-earning employees at top IT exporters is a result of the reset across the $250 billion IT industry, which is currently facing one of the most challenging demand environments in recent years.In the financial year 2024, Infosys witnessed an addition of 12 employees earning over Rs 1 crore annually. Notably, these high earners were among the 1,400 IT staff transferred from Danske Bank to the Bengaluru-based firm following an outsourcing agreement in September of the previous year. Interestingly, Infosys itself did not directly hire any employees with a yearly compensation exceeding Rs 1 crore in fiscal 2024, marking the first such instance since FY17.On the other hand, Wipro onboarded eight employees with salaries of Rs 1 crore or more throughout the fiscal year 2024. The company's annual report, released on Monday, revealed that more than 60% of its workforce had been hired in the past three years. This highlights the significant talent turnover experienced during the tenure of former CEO Thierry Delaporte, which came to an unexpected end in April 2024, a year before his five-year term was set to conclude.Among the senior executives who departed from Wipro during FY24 were former CFO Jatin Dalal and former chief growth officer Stephanie Trautman, along with other key personnel.Also Read | Infosys announces up to Rs 8 lakh incentive package for employees open to transfer to Hubballi campus It is important to note that the number of crorepati employees listed in the annual reports of Infosys and Wipro only includes those who were posted in India during FY24 and have drawn their salary for the full fiscal year. This number does not account for employees who joined or resigned mid-year and were employed by these companies for only a portion of the year.Additionally, experts highlight the impact of the rapid growth in global capability centres (GCCs) on the talent profile of India's leading software exporters.The Indian IT industry is witnessing a significant shift in leadership talent, with many executives moving to midcap companies and Global Capability Centers (GCCs) in pursuit of top leadership positions, particularly CEO roles. Munira Loliwala, vice president for business strategy and growth at TeamLease Digital, a staffing firm, highlighted this trend, stating, ""A lot of leadership talent has, of late, switched to midcaps (IT companies) and GCCs in India, largely to become CEOs or as part of the top leadership.""Also Read | Why IT majors like Cognizant, Infosys, HCLTech are acquiring engineering services companies However, the industry is also facing challenges due to a slowdown in demand, which has forced companies to reduce hiring as they grapple with pressure on both margins and growth. Loliwala noted, ""Due to the continuing softness in demand, companies which are pressured on both margins and growth front have put brakes on hiring."" Consequently, five out of the six largest Indian IT services firms have experienced a decrease in their headcounts during the fiscal year 2024.The combined headcount reduction for these top six companies amounts to nearly 75,000 employees, a situation that is unprecedented for an industry that was once considered a bellwether. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), the industry leader, saw its headcount decline by 13,249 in FY24, while Infosys and Wipro recorded drops of 25,994 and 24,516, respectively, during the same period. HCLTech stood out as the only exception, with a modest increase of 1,537 in its headcount.",The number of employees earning over Rs 1 crore at India's leading IT companies has significantly decreased over the past two fiscal years.

Standard deduction may rise under new tax regime,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/standard-deduction-may-rise-under-new-tax-regime/articleshow/111212512.cms,"NEW DELHI: The finance ministry is assessing the possibility of raising the standard deduction limit for income taxpayers under the new regime, without tinkering with the exemption-laced older regime.Besides, as the NDA govt readies to present its first Budget of its third term, it is unlikely to undertake major tweaks in capital gains mechanism, an issue on which the income tax department has been seeking a review.There have been suggestions to align the holding period across asset classes but govt may not be inclined to disturb the system, at least for the moment.While discussions on the contours of the Budget have just begun with finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman undertaking public consultations, most of the exercise is currently limited to the finance ministry and internal assessment is being undertaken on multiple issues some of which will be discussed with other wings of govt before the finance ministry takes a final call, based on feedback from the PMO.The overall mood indicates that most wings of govt are in favour of offering concessions to taxpayers, especially the middle class, which has been a supporter of the Modi regime but is increasingly raising questions about the returns it gets for the tax it pays, be it through public healthcare or education.In the 2023 Budget, FM had introduced a standard deduction of Rs 50,000 for salaried taxpayers and those who earn pension under the new tax regime, which became the default option, unless you opted out. Also, rebate under Section 87A was increased under the new tax regime for taxable incomes not exceeding Rs 7 lakh, allowing those earning up to this level (taxable income) to not pay any tax under the new regime. The highest surcharge under the new regime was also removed.Currently, individuals with a taxable income of upwards of Rs 3 lakh have to pay 5% income tax and there have been suggestions from industry leaders to tweak the rates in the higher brackets to boost consumption. A higher standard deduction will benefit all the salaried taxpayers, including those in the upper segment although it will entail some revenue loss.","The finance ministry is assessing the possibility of raising the standard deduction limit for income taxpayers under the new regime.

Relief for taxpayers soon? ‘Faceless' income tax assessment mechanism to be made friendlier,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/relief-for-taxpayers-soon-faceless-income-tax-assessment-mechanism-to-be-made-friendlier/articleshow/111281170.cms,"Income Tax Assessment

Income Tax Assessment mechanism to be more taxpayer friendly? The Indian government is currently evaluating the 'faceless' income tax (I-T) assessment system to enhance its taxpayer-friendliness, based on recommendations for improving the program's effectiveness.Introduced on April 1, 2021, the scheme was designed to minimize human interaction in tax disputes and assessments.Under this system, the income tax department handles return processing, refund issuance, tax assessments , scrutiny, and appeal management. Cases are randomly assigned to assessing officers, irrespective of geographical jurisdiction.Sources familiar with the matter told ET that a hybrid approach is under consideration, which would allow taxpayers to choose between the faceless scheme and in-person resolution. ""It is being reviewed to assess effectiveness,"" an official was quoted as saying. He also said that making it optional for taxpayers is a potential solution.Another official mentioned that the aim is to tackle implementation challenges and further simplify compliance for taxpayers. The final decision will be made soon, the official added.Although the video conferencing-based assessment system is considered stable, there has been an increasing demand from both individual and business taxpayers to allow some level of in-person interaction. Additionally, the income tax department's field formations have been advocating for a more hybrid approach to ensure optimal and effective resource utilization.Assessing taxes is a multifaceted process, and experts believe that interactive communication between the taxpayer and the tax officer can lead to more effective outcomes.Also Read | Form 26 AS: Filing Income Tax Return?

Card dues & gold loans beat bank credit growth of 20%,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/card-dues-gold-loans-beat-bank-credit-growth-of-20/articleshow/111387282.cms,"MUMBAI: For banks, credit card outstanding and gold loans remain outliers in growth. The segments recorded a year-on-year increase of 26.2% and 29.7% respectively as of May 2024.This is much higher than the 19.8% growth in overall bank credit which - adjusting bank's books for the addition of loans due to HDFC's merger with HDFC Bank - shrinks down to 16.1%.The increase in credit card and gold loans comes at a time when RBI has expressed concerns over unsecured credit and is taking a hard look at the gold loan books of some lenders, given the surge in prices of the yellow metal.Another segment that has been of concern to RBI - bank credit to non-banking financial companies - has moderated. But this segment's growth is still faster than overall bank credit growth at 16%.Monthly sectoral data on bank credit released by RBI shows that credit card outstanding stood at Rs 2.7 lakh crore as of May, up from Rs 2.6 lakh crore at the end of March 2024 and Rs 2.1 lakh crore a year ago.Banks' gold loan books stood at Rs 1.2 lakh crore at the end of May, compared to Rs 1 lakh crore at the end of March and Rs 90,036 crore in the year-ago period. Bankers said that the increase could also have been due to an increase in market share fromNBFCs . Credit cards and gold loans are watched carefully because they reflect household indebtedness and at times financial distress.The personal segment, with a year-on-year growth rate of 28.7%, continues to be the fastest-growing among industry, agriculture, services and personal loans. However, this is due to the HDFC-HDFC Bank merger, which has resulted in home loans growing nearly 39% yearly (16.9% excluding the merger).Excluding the merger impact, services are the fastest-growing segment at 23.2% versus 17.8% in the personal segment. A large component of service industry loans comprises of providing loans to lenders.While the growth rate in credit to NBFCs has moderated from a high of 27% a year ago, the book size continues to remain large at nearly Rs 15.7 lakh crore - up 1.3% from Rs 15.5 lakh crore in March.","The increase in credit card and gold loans comes at a time when RBI has expressed concerns over unsecured credit. The increase could also have been due to an increase in market share fromNBFCs.

The amount sent home by foreign workers has gone up 71% from $70 billion to $120 billion over the same period.India continues to be the highest recipient of foreign remittances, getting nearly twice the amount received by Mexico at $66 billion.According to a study by the Bank of Baroda , money flowing into India has increased at a CAGR of 5.5% over the last decade - higher than the global growth rate of 4%. Only Mexico, at 10%, has grown its inward remittances at a faster decadal CAGR than India, which has helped it overtake China to claim the second place.""From just $1.1 billion in FY14, remittance outflows increased to $31.7 billion in FY24.

In 2024, BoB expects inflows to continue to grow.Global growth is expected to gradually improve, with the US expected to remain resilient. Labour markets in the US, UK and Eurozone remain robust with unemployment rates near record lows, which bodes well for inward remittances.

Budget 2024 income tax expectations : Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is expected to present the first full Union Budget 2024 of the Modi 3.0 government in July. Like every year, salaried individuals are looking at FM Sitharaman to provide tax relief in the form of reduced tax rates, changed income tax slabs and even higher deductions.One such relief that is sought is to include more non-metro cities in the 50% House Rent Allowance (HRA) exemption list.HRA is a common component of employee compensation packages provided by many employers.Employees receiving HRA and paying rent for their accommodation can claim a tax exemption on the allowance under the old income tax regime. The exemption amount depends on whether the employee resides in a metro city or not for tax purposes. However, if an employee receiving HRA does not live in a rented house, the entire allowance becomes fully taxable.According to an ET report quoting Radhika Viswanathan, Executive Director at Deloitte Haskins & Sells LLP, the Income-tax Act, 1961, under Section 10(13A), provides tax exemption for HRA. The amount of HRA that can be claimed as tax exempt is the lowest of the following:1. Actual HRA received;2. Actual Rent paid minus 10% of basic salary;3. 50% of basic salary (for metro cities)/40% of basic salary (for non-metro cities).Also Read | Budget 2024 income tax expectations: Modi government may lower personal tax rates, says report - top 5 points Currently, rented houses in Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, and Chennai are eligible for a 50% exemption from HRA, while those in other locations fall under the 40% category. It is important to note that this classification was established over three decades ago, according to Viswanathan.As cities have expanded in terms of population and economic growth, it has become necessary to re-evaluate the way we define metro and non-metro cities.Interestingly, the Constitution (seventy-fourth Amendment) Act, 1992, also recognizes the National Capital Region (NCR), Bangalore, Pune, Hyderabad as metro cities. Despite this, the HRA tax exemption for salaried individuals in these cities remains at 40% due to outdated tax laws.Also Read | Standard deduction may rise under new tax regime Residing outside of metro cities can result in a higher proportion of one's income being paid in taxes. For instance, an individual living in Bengaluru may have to pay a higher average rent compared to someone residing in Kolkata or Chennai, which are classified as metro cities for tax purposes.Those living in rapidly developing non-metro cities, as defined by the Income-tax Act, may pay higher rents due to rapid urbanization. But, they receive lower tax benefits for house rent compared to metro cities. With an increasing number of people relocating to these non-metro cities for employment, it is crucial for the government to reassess the regulations for claiming rent exemptions to alleviate the financial strain on taxpayers, feel experts.",Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is expected to present the first full Union Budget 2024 of the Modi 3.0 government in July.

The sources told Reuters that a reduction in personal tax could boost consumption and increase savings for the middle class. The first source mentioned that individuals earning over Rs 15 lakh ($17,960.42) annually, up to a certain undetermined amount, may receive some tax relief.

The changes could be made to the new income tax regime introduced in 2020, where annual income up to Rs 15 lakh is taxed at rates between 5% and 20%, while earnings over Rs 15 lakh are taxed at 30%.

The second source pointed out that the personal tax rate increases six-fold when an individual's income rises from Rs 300,000 to Rs 15 lakh, which they described as ""quite steep.""

The government may also consider lowering personal tax rates for annual incomes of Rs 10 lakh, according to the first source. They added that a new threshold is being discussed for income taxed at the highest rate of 30% under the old tax system.

The second source noted that any loss of tax income to the government through tax cuts could be partially offset by increased consumption from this category of income earners.

The finance minister set the stage for a ""Viksit Bharat by 2047"", on the core principles of ‘Sabka Saath’, ‘Sabka Vikas’, ‘Sabka Vishwas’, with ‘Sabka Prayas’ being added as a new theme in the interim Budget.This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data i.e., farmer welfare and N for Nari utthan i.e., support for women entrepreneurs. These form the pillars of a comprehensive inclusive development. The Government's commitment to sustainable development under the strategy for Amrit Kaal includes achieving 'Net Zero' by 2070, rooftop solarization for one crore households and robust health initiatives.The Indian economy's resilience takes center stage amidst positive indicators of declining current account deficit as a percentage of GDP, falling unemployment rates, and a notable rise in digital transactions. These statistics affirm the robustness of the economy, showcasing a trajectory of growth and stability.The achievements in taxation reforms are nothing short of remarkable, with direct tax collections more than trebling in the last decade, the number of tax return filers increasing by 2.4 times, average processing time of tax returns plummeting from 93 days in FY 2013-14 to an impressive 10 days in FY 2023-24, resulting in issuance of quick refunds. These are the results of consistent progressive measures thus obviating the need for, and rightly avoiding, any last-minute populist measures.No change in existing tax rates, both for direct and indirect taxes, is a good indicator of stability and predictability for investors and taxpayers.A welcome move to waive outstanding tax demands that are minor, disputed, and unreconciled. This involves the withdrawal of outstanding direct tax demands up to Rs. 25,000 pertaining to the period up to FY 2009-10 and up to Rs.10,000 for FY 2010-11 to 2014-15.The Government's commitment to fostering a business-friendly environment is evident in its intent to extend specific tax benefits for start-ups, investments by sovereign wealth funds/ pension funds, and certain IFSC units. The extension has been made now until March 31, 2025. This might help in creating a conducive landscape for business.To align with the CBDT notification issued earlier, the provisions relating to tax collection at source concerning remittances under the Liberalized Remittance Scheme have now been formally incorporated in the Finance Bill, 2024, setting the rate at 20% for amounts exceeding Rs. 7 lakhs in a financial year.The Finance Bill, 2024 proposes an extension of the time limit for introducing the faceless scheme by the Central Government for transfer pricing proceedings, DRP Proceedings, and ITAT Proceedings, up to March 31, 2025.The interim Budget 2024 may not have proposed significant tax announcements, but it very well positioned the prelude to the full budget post the upcoming elections. Considering the potential impact on the population across the four pillars of GYAN, a sizable portion of India stands to be covered. The interim Budget’s focus on the tax front resembles a report card, highlighting the maturity achieved by our tax system. The enhancement of taxpayer services was emphasized as a key priority.","This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data and N for Nari utthan.

The Finance Minister on February 01, 2024, delivered a truly innovative interim budget. At first glance, it did not seem like an interim budget but looked more like the budget to drive further growth and a continuum of inclusive growth-oriented investments.At the outset, this budget brings a wonderful balance between fiscal prudence and continued investment for growth.It's not easy to continue the glide path of reducing the fiscal deficit and continuing to make significant investments in all areas including infrastructure, R&D, energy transition, technology, skilling, and social welfare. The surprising reduction in fiscal deficit of 5.8% as against the budgeted 5.9% for FY24 and the projection of 5.1% in FY25 with a clear focus on increasing investments was a huge positive.This was a budget for everyone and all because it caters to every part of the Indian economy and society. The FM has carefully catered to the investment needs of various sectors. The continued focus on youth, impoverished, women and farmers to increase their involvement and contribution to economic growth is evident. By committing an 11.1% increase in capital expenditure to 11,11,111 lakh crore, the FM has clearly brought every single 1 in this growth journey.What was very impressive was the inclusion strategy of the government. The focus on women's empowerment for the past few years is unprecedented, which is reflected in the inclusion of women in the workforce moving from 23.3% to 37% in the last five years. The thirty crore Mudra Yojna loans to women entrepreneurs were a great boost to the Nari Shakti initiative. We already have over 10 million Lakhpati Didis and what is truly evident is like a corporate CFO, the FM has revised the earlier target of 20 million Lakhpati Didis to 30 million. The government also plans to invest in initiatives to encourage young girls between the ages of 9 and 14 to undertake the vaccination for cervical cancer which is again a great boost to Nari Shakti.A lot needs to be done to bring more women into all parts of economic growth but the journey so far and the vision of the future is truly inspiring.While India continues on its technological prowess and makes its mark in new technologies like Artificial Intelligence, we need a multi-pronged strategy to harness the power of AI. We need a clear focus on building AI systems in India so that we not only emerge as a global leader in this new era but can build models, which are specific to India that will benefit Indians. At the same time, we need a very wide coverage program to build skills to leverage AI to its fullest potential. The biggest contribution we can make to the inclusion of youth in the economic development of the country is by skilling them in new skill areas. In the last few years, the Skill India Mission has trained 14 million youth, reskilled over 5 million youth and established a staggering 3,000 new ITIs. The future of any country will depend as much on capital investments as on skill investments.The focus on agricultural development and support to the farmer continues through direct financial assistance to farmers. The farmers have benefited by getting crop insurance through PM Fasal Bima Yojana. It's not just the farmers, the PM-SVANidhi provides credit assistance to a large number of street vendors.The last few years have seen the journey of affordable housing through Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY). There is a slight increase in allocation to launch a scheme for encouraging the middle class to build or buy new homes. This investment will likely propel a wider economic development and increase employment.India has seen a tremendous rise in entrepreneurship in the last few years. In order to continue the journey and promote new startups, the government proposes to extend certain tax benefits, which are expiring from March 2024 to March 2025. The MSMEs have not been left behind. With a proposal to provide timely finances to such enterprises, the government has paved the way for their growth, so they can look to compete globally.All in all, it’s a truly inclusive budget with a clear focus on development not just by giving away freebies but enabling the people to participate in the economic development activity.

‘Enough domestic sources of demand to counter drag from external sector’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/enough-domestic-sources-of-demand-to-counter-drag-from-external-sector/articleshow/107372012.cms,"Do you think the

creates room for lower interest rates?

One of the issues that the Budget has flagged is the demographic challenge and opportunity and the societal change that is taking place. How do you view this?

Niti Aayog is working on the Viksit Bharat roadmap. What will be the focus areas?

You are as much a representative of the Centre as well as the states. Is it time to revisit the entire formula for transfers to states particularly on the issue of cesses and surcharges?

Suman Bery , who heads Niti Aayog , the govt think tank, is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China, which he says is also an opportunity for India. The economist is confident that Indian states remain resilient. Excerpts of the interview with TOI.The finance ministry expects the economy to grow 7% next year. Given the global situation, how do you see the prospects?The belief in the finance ministry is that we have a possible drag coming from the external sector but that we have other sources. We have enough domestic sources of demand. One has to applaud the political and economic judgment of FM in deciding that it was appropriate to pursue the path of fiscal consolidation. There is transparency. What this actually reflects is responsible economic management, which is one reason we are where we are. Second, it also creates a buffer so that there is policy space if we do encounter headwinds.That’s the hope and expectation. We have an independent central bank and an inflation targeting central bank, so it is up to the monetary policy committee to take a call through the monetary policy committee on the repo rate .The PM has said that when India grows its states grow. India is a composite of 37 states and UTs. They are each at very different points in their demographic transition. There are some states where the net replacement rate is down to 1%, like Kerala . There are others, particularly UP and Bihar, which are in their earliest stage of demographic transition and each one of these states is the size of a large European country. There are two implications of that — one is internal labour mobility and it will become an even larger part of our growth model. The govt has taken several steps to create a unified market. Our main endowment is our human capital and that has to be equipped to participate in global exchange in many ways. We know from China, Japan that the demographic dividend partly depends on markets and on human capital. But the golden period is fairly short lived, about 15 years, when the so called dependency ratio declines. The other big opportunity the PM has been highlighting is bringing women much more into the active labour force.When Niti was set up there was the idea of a three-year vision and a seven-year strategy paper. The reality is that schemes of govt tend to be aligned with the award of the Finance Commission . There are various established building blocks or hand holds which are already a matter of govt policy. The PM is much more interested in a national debate on what it means to be a Viksit Bharat or modern society. We have a collective goal and it is for the democratic polity to define what that goal should be. Its emphatically not for a super mandarin bureaucracy. It is not going to be Lee Kwan Yew’s Singapore led from the top.It’s entirely a finance ministry matter but I would be lying if I didn’t say when I visit certain states there is this complaint. A big frontier would be resource mobilisation at the state level. Second is going to be rationalisation of subsidies not only at the Union level, but also at the state level. All chief ministers sit on my governing council. When they convene as the governing council, I see them in their role as development practitioners. The world is beginning to appreciate quite how much institutional and political maturity India attained in our 75 years and the most fundamental dimension of a democracy, we have orderly transfers of power. There are enough buffers to ensure that what happens in state finances is unlikely to create macro instability. Those risks are well contained by our Constitution. The chief ministers know that they are going to be judged by development outcomes and so you can have the sugar rush of changing of pension plans or various handouts but if the cupboard is bare you are not going to be able to deliver.","Suman Bery is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China.

Government's Marathon to 2047: Emphasis on Fiscal Prudence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/governments-marathon-to-2047-emphasis-on-fiscal-prudence/articleshow/107371788.cms,"What was the thinking behind keeping the vote on account absolutely straight?

So is it the idea to keep the Budget completely transparent?

The capex has risen 11.1% and there is an emphasis on infrastructure spending. But there is also the hope that the private sector will now take over and start capital spending. Given the geopolitical situation, how confident is the govt that it will pan out as planned?

Finance secretary T V Somanathan, in an interview with TOI, says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047 . Excerpts:If you see the Budget speech you will see the emphasis on 2047. The govt has set its sight on running that marathon. Running to 2047 is a marathon , it’s not a sprint. If you are going to run a marathon, you need to be in good shape and you can’t have short-term stimulants or something that will get you some yards and then it’s done.The whole focus is on making India a developed country by 2047, for which a healthy present and a strong fiscal position is an important concomitant. Some purely short term measures don’t really fit into that picture. It’s a consistent picture: focus on the long term for which you need to build strength in the short term and that needs to be done by prudence in fiscal policy and by not doing things which can detract you from that path. Not doing the wrong thing is more important than appearing to do things.The idea is that govt finances may be good, bad or indifferent depending on the times, depending on the circumstances, depending on the policies. But what is the position should be reflected as reasonably and accurately as possible. That is an emphasis. As regards the Finance Commission, again the terms of reference that have been given to them are the terms in the Constitution.What is the means by which the devolution should be done is a matter they have full discretion. They can actually take all kinds of factors into account and in a sense we felt this time based on my review of the previous commissions that the right expression would be less is more. The shorter, less prescriptive terms of reference gives full scope for all stakeholders including state govts to express their viewpoints and for the commission to take a balanced view of the different perspectives and then come to its award. Ultimately the award of the Finance Commission is about devolution and grant for which full scope has now been given to them.n There are incipient signs of private capital expenditure accelerating. There are some surveys I have seen done by some of the chambers industry, which show high levels of investment. The PMI, which is a sort of leading indicator, is also looking pretty healthy. Capacity utilisation is one reason that private sector capital expenditure doesn’t immediately pick up when the economy starts accelerating because there is surplus capacity.But increasingly I get the sense that many industries are beginning to reach levels where they have to add capacity. When that happens capital investment will happen. Another pointer also mentioned in the Budget speech you may notice that our airlines have placed large orders for planes — that is capital expenditure.When you import 1,000 aircraft, it’s just not 1,000 aircraft, there are concomitant additions to ground handling facilities, you need airports to expand, you need to employ people to do that. That means a lot of jobs. The aircraft is capital but then look at the effect it is going to have on skilled jobs. So capital expenditure is happening. I am fairly confident that we will have decent capital expenditure in the year to come and that will become a new source of acceleration.",Finance secretary T V Somanathan says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047.

Jayachandran Ramachandran: Claude 3.5 Sonnet sets new coding benchmarks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/times-techies/claude-3-5-sonnet-sets-new-coding-benchmarks/articleshow/111329656.cms,"Anthropic’s latest AI model , Claude 3.5 Sonnet , arrived seemingly out of nowhere last week, free to use for everyone, and is now setting new benchmarks in a number of metrics. Most notably, it aced the leader boards in key categories of the LMSYS Chatbot Arena , a benchmark used to measure large language model performance. Specifically, it secured the top position in the ‘Coding Arena’ and ‘Hard Prompts’ categories, beating industry behemoths like GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro , all while being a lighter, faster model to run.Jayachandran Ramachandran , senior VP of Artificial Intelligence Labs for C5i, says the LMSYS Chatbot Arena is a crowdsourced open benchmarking platform and that users perform various tasks in pair wise comparison of models and provide feedback on which models can satisfactorily provide the best response. “The ranking system is quite transparent, robust, and reliable. In recent times, the top position was occupied by frontier models such as GPT-4 series and Gemini-1.5 series. It is a significant development for Claude 3.5 Sonnet to outsmart other leading frontier models and occupy the top position, especially in coding tasks,” he says.Saurav Swaroop , co-founder & CTO of financing platform Velocity, which recently launched Vani AI , a GenAIled customer calling solution for financial institutions, says that while GPT-4 has been assisting developers with writing code for some time now, it has been prone to errors and hallucinations. “However, Claude can write production level deployable code now. This will boost developer productivity and the time to build software will keep coming down,” he says.With its advanced reasoning skills, it’s great at handling multi-step workflows too, which is essential for complex projects, says Sourabh Kumar, senior manager of experience engineering for Publicis Sapient. “Compared to other industry leaders like GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet offers faster processing speeds and higher accuracy in complex coding and reasoning tasks. For industries such as finance, where accurate data analysis is critical, or retail, where trend prediction can drive success, integrating Claude 3.5 Sonnet can lead to significant efficiency gains and innovation,” he says.Claude 3.5 Sonnet can also offer alternative solutions that coders might not have even considered, says Bebi Negi, senior lead data scientist at the Analytics Centre of Excellence for Happiest Minds Technologies.However, Bebi says coders will still need to check the code created by the model. “While it can create code quickly, it is very important to understand the code and make sure it meets a project’s requirements and standards. Even though benchmarks rate the model at around 90%, the remaining 10% gap underscores the necessity for coders to review the outputs,” she says.Securing the top spot in the Hard Prompts category was also a big deal, says Bebi. “The Hard Prompts category was all about handling complex tasks and instructions. The model did a great job here too, showing it can understand and generate high-quality content, even when the instructions are quite tricky.”","Anthropic’s latest AI model, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, is now free to use for everyone.

GenAI: On-device AI is cheaper and faster than cloud,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/times-techies/on-device-ai-is-cheaper-and-faster-than-cloud/articleshow/111329501.cms,"As devices such as smartphones , laptops, tablets and cars become more intelligent and powerful with increased processing capabilities and sensors, the tech industry is focusing on harnessing the power of AI on the edge or on-device AI to come up with more context-aware personalised user experiences.And while AI may have started off as something very specific to image processing, it has over the past four to five years evolved and exploded, especially with GenAI coming into play, to include a lot more use cases around text processing, voice processing and multimodal use cases, said Rajesh Narayanan, vice president of engineering at Qualcomm .He was speaking on ₹AI on the Edge’ at the first edition of the ‘TechForward’ research seminar series launched by Indian Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad (IIITH). The series seeks to spark regular and deep academia-industry conversations around emerging technologies.Narayanan pointed out that on-device AI has evolved to offer advantages such as personalisation , privacy and security, and with lower energy consumption and costs, and better performance compared to AI on the cloud.“Today, smartphones, smartwatches, devices that are a part of home automation, devices in the car and industrial IoT are equipped with plenty of cameras and sensors and are becoming a lot more powerful with the ability to collect more data. They also have more processing capacities, leading to more context aware user experience that can lead to a much better day-to-day life for all of us,” he said.He said that for all this to become a reality, you need a very powerful AI engine, and the overall solution has to be extremely power efficient.Personalisation is a key selling point for on-device AI as all the data that was earlier being sent to the cloud, potentially compromising privacy and security, can be done on the device. On-device AI also brings down energy consumption significantly compared to running workloads on a much bigger infrastructure like the cloud.Performance too improves as processing on the device itself can enable low latency as opposed to sending the query to the cloud, as with devices like Alexa.Narayanan said on-device AI is also a lot more affordable compared to the cloud. “As we transition from traditional AI to GenAI, the cost per query is actually going up and cloud economics isn’t going to work as compared to doing it on the device,” he said.In his talk on Vision on the AI edge’, Anoop Namboodiri , who heads the Biometrics and Secure Identity Lab and is associated with the Centre for Visual Information Technology at IIITH, said computer vision is playing a key role in pushing AI, and now GenAI.","The tech industry is focusing on harnessing the power of AI on the edge or on- device AI to come up with more context-aware personalised user experiences.

Service bots get our lingo,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/times-techies/service-bots-get-our-lingo/articleshow/111329125.cms,"Moving to complex functions

Indic language capability

is a little expensive now

The other day I decided to check out an airline’s chatbot to see how it works. I keyed in: “I’m travelling with my 8-year-old son, recommend the best flight without disturbing his sleep”. It asked for my source and destination, which I gave as Chennai and Hyderabad. It asked for the date. I typed ₹Mon’ (for Monday), but it did not recognise what I meant.I typed ₹tom’, it correctly recognised it as tomorrow.The bot responded that there were no flights that “fully meet” my specified criteria and provided a bunch of options. I then asked for the cheapest flight, and non-stop flights. The options it provided were correct – I confirmed that on MakeMyTrip and Google Flights. It automatically filled the passenger list as 1 adult and 1 child for booking. It even clarified the availability of gluten free food for my fictional son.Customer support bots have come a long way from the days of clunky bots that only answered FAQs. These sophisticated generative AI-based tools are much better than their predecessors, though still far from perfect. Sometimes they ask silly questions even after being explicitly told. They struggle to recognise colloquial words, have woefully poor memory, unlike human agents. But at least you don’t have to listen to hold music for 15 minutes.The leap comes from GenAI ’s ability to understand conversations better, their ability to understand multilingual queries , and support for interfaces like voice and videos. As these systems improve, customer support will become a lot quicker and easier for users, and hugely cheaper for companies, since they won’t have to hire thousands of contact centre staff.Ramprakash Ramamoorthy, director of AI Research at Zoho Corp, says with GenAI, the next goal is to make customer assistant bots do more complex and autonomous functions. He says they could hand over the issue to human agents when it figures it can’t handle it. He says they may even be able to process warranty claims, for instance. “As soon as you reach out, the system will be able to cross-check the database for similar issues/ queries where warranty claims are applicable. A human agent will have to call a supervisor to do the same job,” he says.But these are still some time away. Even for basic customer support services, companies are being careful due to concerns around data privacy, and hallucination. Nobody, after all, wants to get into a situation like Air Canada did earlier this year when its chatbot offered a discount to a customer that it wasn’t supposed to.Chaitanya Chokkareddy, cofounder of Ozonetel, the Hyderabadbased customer experience tech provider, says the focus currently is on automating the most common, repetitive queries. Chatbots, he says, fail in non-common areas of work.He says a lot of work is happening with AI in the back-end like data analysis, summary, intent analysis, and quality control, focusing on efficiency and productivity of human customer agents and improving margins of companies. “We handle about 20 million calls per day which last about 3 to 5 minutes each, and a lot of that data is currently not accessible to managers to make better decisions on their product and services. Demand for back-end services is higher than customer facing applications,” he says.While AI assistants perform relatively well in English, their performance in Indic languages is not great. Ozonetel is building Telugu language tokenisation by working with a non-profit and 1 lakh student interns to build a Telugu database. But Indian languages, he says, cost around 5x to 10x more compared to English because of the complex tokenisation of Indian languages compared to the Roman alphabet. “AI models are charged based on usage and chatbots using Indic scripts have more tokens and hence have higher computational costs. In many cases, the costs are equivalent to a human being and so our customers don’t want to automate,” Chaitanya says.Ankush Sabharwal’s CoRover.ai also has a local language model called BharatGPT. The bot can respond to voice queries in Indian languages, and provide tailored information. It also has video chatbots with pre-generated videos and text-to-video conversion and lip sync, which can be used for purposes like internal training.Ankush says redundant workload should be automated first, and as the adoption increases, more clear use cases will emerge. He says problems like hallucination can be reduced with retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and use of domain-specific small models.Abhiroop Medhekar, founder & CEO of financing platform Velocity, says they have built text-to-speech and speech-to-text tech for AI-agent voice call automation. They initially used it internally and then started commercial offerings. “Some BFSI applications require an immediate response from customers, but customers frequently don’t respond to mails or WhatsApp reminders. The current robotic IVR calls are not effective either. But these GenAI-based voice calls are interactive and provide better results,” he says.","Chatbots have come a long way from the days of clunky bots that only answered FAQs.

Excise policy case: Delhi HC to rule on BRS leader K Kavitha's bail plea in on July 1,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/delhi-hc-to-rule-on-brs-leader-k-kavithas-bail-plea-in-excise-case-on-july-1/articleshow/111375076.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court is set to announce its decision on July 1, 2024, regarding the bail petitions filed by Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) leader K Kavitha in cases related to the excise policy and examined by the Central Bureau of Investigation ( CBI ) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED).The bench of Justice Swarna Kanta Sharma reserved the order on May 28, 2024, after hearing arguments from all involved parties.Representing K Kavitha, Senior Advocate Vikram Chaudhari, Advocate Nitesh Rana, and other lawyers, Mohit Rao and Deepak Nagar, presented their submissions. Advocate DP Singh represented the CBI, while Advocate Zoheb Hossain appeared for the ED.The CBI countered the bail plea , arguing that the ongoing investigation is at a crucial stage involving other public servants and private individuals, and tracing the flow of illicit money.They asserted that if Kavitha is granted bail, there is a significant risk that she might obstruct the investigation, especially when she fails to meet the 'triple test,' as prescribed by the Constitutional Courts across various precedents.""The accused petitioner is released on bail, there is every likelihood that she will thwart the investigation, more specifically when she fails to meet the 'triple test,' as laid down by the constitutional courts in a catena of decisions,"" the CBI stated in opposition to the bail plea.The ED also opposed Kavitha's bail request by noting that standard conditions to ensure the accused's presence at trial or protect evidence are insufficient in money laundering cases due to their trans-border nature and the potential influence of the accused. They cautioned that an accused could utilize modern technology to covertly remove the money trail, thus undermining the investigation and trial.""In the case of an offence of money laundering, mere routine conditions that ensure the presence of the accused during the trial or protect the evidence are not enough because of the trans-border nature of the offence and the influence that may be exercised by the accused. An accused can anonymously remove the money trail using the technology available today, making the investigation and trial infructuous,"" the ED argued.Previously, the Delhi high court had issued notices to the Enforcement Directorate and CBI regarding Kavitha's bail petitions in the money laundering case connected to the now-discarded Excise policy of Delhi. The ED recently submitted a supplementary prosecution complaint (chargesheet) in the Excise Policy money laundering case in Rouse Avenue Court. The chargesheet includes accusations against K Kavitha, Chanpreet Singh, Damodar, Prince Singh, and Arvind Kumar.In her bail petition, K Kavitha highlighted her familial responsibilities, noting that she is the mother of two children, one of whom is a minor currently under medical care. She insisted that attempts have been made to implicate her in the scandal by members of the ruling party at the Centre.In her latest bail plea, she argued that the entire case against her built by the Enforcement Directorate relies solely on statements from witnesses and co-accused under Section 50 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).""The entire case of the Enforcement Directorate hinges upon statements made by the approver, witnesses, or co-accused under Section 50 of the PMLA. The Prosecution Complaints do not provide a single document that corroborates the statements. There is not a single piece of evidence that points to the guilt of the Applicant,"" she stated.She further claimed that her arrest was illegal, asserting there was no adherence to Section 19 of the PMLA. She argued there was no corroboration of any actual cash transaction or money trail, making the arrest order’s expression of her guilt superficial and pretentious.""The arrest of the applicant is illegal as Section 19 of the PMLA has not been complied with. Neither has any corroboration to the allegation of the actual cash transaction nor any money trail is forthcoming, therefore, the satisfaction of guilt as expressed in her Arrest Order is merely a sham and a pretense,"" she submitted.On May 6, the Rouse Avenue Court of Delhi had dismissed the bail requests put forth by K Kavitha in connection to both the CBI and ED cases linked to the Excise Policy. Following her arrests on March 15, 2024, by the Enforcement Directorate, and on April 11, 2024, by the CBI, a remand application was made, stating the necessity of her custodial interrogation.""Kavitha Kalvakuntla was required to be arrested in the instant case to conduct her custodial interrogation for confronting her with the evidence and witnesses to unearth the larger conspiracy hatched among the accused, suspect persons regarding the formulation and implementation of the Excise Policy, as well as to establish the money trail of ill-gotten money generated and to establish the role of other accused/suspect persons, including public servants, as well as to unearth the facts which are in her exclusive knowledge,"" the CBI stated through their remand application.CBI's investigation was recommended following the Delhi Chief Secretary’s report in July, which indicated prima facie violations of the GNCTD Act 1991, Transaction of Business Rules (ToBR)-1993, Delhi Excise Act-2009, and Delhi Excise Rules-2010.Accusations by the ED and CBI claimed that irregularities occurred during the modification of the excise policy, including undue advantages extended to license holders, waiving or reduction of license fees, and extending the L-1 license without proper authorization.They alleged that the benefits received were illicitly diverted to officials, with false entries made in financial records to avoid detection. The Excise Department also reportedly decided to refund an earnest money deposit of approximately Rs 30 crore to a successful tenderer against set rules.Despite lacking an enabling provision, a waiver on tendered license fees was reportedly sanctioned from December 28, 2021, to January 27, 2022, due to COVID-19, resulting in an alleged loss of Rs 144.36 crore to the exchequer.","The Delhi high court is set to announce its decision on July 1, 2024, regarding the bail petitions filed by Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) leader K Kavitha in cases related to the excise policy.

However, the former journalist, who made history in the 2000s with a scoop on the expenses of British MPs when he was editor of the Daily Telegraph, is finding his position increasingly vulnerable.For weeks now, revelations have multiplied about his role, when he was working for the Murdoch family's conservative media group about 12 years ago, in a scandal of illegal phone tapping by the tabloid The News of the World. On Friday, Lewis was at the centre of an investigation by his own journalists. According to the Washington Post, he gave the go-ahead in 2011 for the destruction of thousands of emails, fuelling suspicions that he was destroying evidence, which he denies.As the US presidential election approaches, the affair is poisoning the atmosphere at a long-vaunted newspaper that is ""not doing well economically,"" says Northeastern University journalism professor Dan Kennedy.The Post was among trusted news outlets that benefited from the upheaval that marked Trump's four years in the White House that ended with his loss to President Joe Biden.

Who is 'cryptoqueen' Ruja Ignatova? Why US announced $5 million reward on her,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/who-is-ruja-ignatova-why-us-announced-a-5-million-reward-on-this-cryptoqueen/articleshow/111338908.cms,"Who is Ruja Ignatova?

How Ignatova defrauded investors?

Charges in absentia

The United States announced a reward of up to $5 million for information leading to the capture of OneCoin founder Ruja Ignatova popularly known as "" cryptoqueen ."" She is wanted by both the United States and Germany ""for her participation in one of the largest global fraud schemes in history,"" which resulted in losses exceeding $4 billion for victims, according to US ambassador to Bulgaria Kenneth Merten.Ambassador Merten stated that the United States will release a statement later on Wednesday detailing how individuals can ""anonymously provide tips to assist us in this ongoing investigation.""Ruja Ignatova, aged 44 is a German citizen of Bulgarian origin, who launched a ripoff of bitcoin named 'BigCoin' with her friend Sebastian Karl Greenwood . Later, both of them launched another fake cyptocurrency named 'OneCoin' in Sofia in 2014 and raised billion of dollars. It was later revealed that she duped investors worldwide of an estimated $4 billion between 2014 and in 2017.She evaded arrest by fleeing on a flight from Sofia to Athens just two weeks after her indictment in October 2017, and her current location remains unknown. It is believed that she bugged her American boyfriend flat whom she suspected of cooperating with the FBI.She was later added to the list of the 10 most wanted fugitives by the Federal Bureau of Investigation on charges of forgery and money laundering in 2022. Some reports also suggests that that she underwent a plastic surgery and frequently changes her appearance.However, her partner Greenwood was arrested in 2018 in Thailand and later extradited to the US. He was sentenced to 20 years in prison and was also ordered to pay back $300 million back to the investors.Ignatova's brother Konstantin Ignatov was arrested at Los Angeles International Airport in March 2019. He pleaded guilty to wire fraud in a deal with US authorities and was sentenced to 34 months in jail. He was released in March 2024.Meanwhile, a recent BBC investigation claims that that a top mafia figure in Bulgaria, Hristoforos Nikos Amanatidis, better known as Taki, who has a El Chapo-like image in his native Bulgaria might have murdered her.Ignatova and her associates tapped the global network to market the fake crypto to friends and family in exchange for their own payouts. Millions of investos infused funds in large amounts before they realised that OneCoin wasn’t a cryptocurrency and was not backed by any secured, independent blockchain-type technology like other crypto currencies.Meanwhile, the FBI said that when OneCoin users logged in to check their wallets, they’d simply see random numbers on a screen. The US government has termed OneCoin as one of the “biggest fraud schemes” in the global history.It was a classic Ponzi scheme , in which early investors are encouraged to find others and then paid out by receipts from later investorsMoreover OneCoin's prices were always rigged as it didn’t have any independent foundation, no technological basis. While Bitcoin had ups and downs, OneCoin rose steadily in ‘value’ from €0.5 in January 2015 to €29.95 in January 2019.Additionally, the fake crypto never traded on public exchange. Ignatova had created a private exchange named Xcoinx.com for trading, however, it was designed to prevent quick exits. If you owned 1,000 OneCoins, you were allowed to sell a maximum of 15 (1.5%) in a day. Besides, there was no guarantee that your sell order would be executed. Additionally, starting January 2017, Xcoinx was always ‘under maintenance’, so selling became impossible.Bulgaria has announced to prosecute Igantovs in absentia, as announced by chief prosecutor Borislav Sarafov on Wednesday, enabling proceedings to confiscate her property worth over 10 million euros.","Ruja Ignatova, 44, is a German citizen of Bulgarian origin.
