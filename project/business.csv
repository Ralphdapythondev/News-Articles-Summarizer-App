Gold prices fall: Have gold ETFs turned more attractive than sovereign gold bonds?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-prices-fall-have-gold-etfs-turned-more-attractive-than-sovereign-gold-bonds/articleshow/112619710.cms,"Gold ETFs & Returns

Gold ETFs turn attractive: The recent reduction in customs duty on gold, coupled with long-term tax benefits announced in the budget, has made gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and gold funds an attractive investment option for many. Additionally, the expected discontinuation of new issuances of sovereign gold bonds (SGB) is further driving investors towards these investment vehicles.According to an ET report, financial experts recommend that investors should allocate at least 10% of their portfolio to gold. They suggest that the current dip in gold prices offers a favorable opportunity for those who have not yet invested in gold to consider adding it to their portfolio.The recent reduction in customs duty on gold has led to a 6% drop in domestic gold prices, bringing the cost down to Rs 69,100 per 10 grams.In addition to the price drop, the recent budget announcement has also made gold more tax-efficient in the long run. The long-term tax incidence on gold has been changed from the investor's tax slab to a flat 12.5% after a holding period of two years.Chirag Mehta, chief investment officer at Quantum Mutual Fund, was quoted as saying, ""This is a significant advantage from a tax perspective and should stand at an advantage for investors in addition to other benefits that Gold ETFs provide.""Previously, wealth managers preferred sovereign gold bonds due to the additional 2.5% annual interest paid by the government, the absence of an expense ratio, and tax-free capital gains upon maturity.Also Read | These mutual funds have returned 100% more than Nifty!

However, with the last primary issue of sovereign gold bonds in March 2024 and no announcement of fresh issues this year, coupled with the existing series trading at a 10-12% premium in secondary markets, investors looking to add gold to their portfolios may be better off buying gold ETFs or gold mutual funds, according to Nikhil Gupta, founder of Sage Capital.Gold is considered a valuable asset in a portfolio due to its ability to diversify and act as a hedge against inflation. Analysts recommend holding 5-10% of one's portfolio in gold.Tapan Patel, fund manager at Tata Asset Management, believes that market uncertainty surrounding the US elections and the Federal Reserve's policy stance may drive inflows into gold funds, especially in a rate cut scenario.

Fastest manufacturing growth in 50 years? Apple’s India business surpasses Rs 2 lakh crore; tech giant India’s largest global value chain,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/fastest-manufacturing-growth-in-50-years-apples-india-business-surpasses-rs-2-lakh-crore-tech-giant-indias-largest-global-value-chain/articleshow/112513335.cms,"Apple's Growing Harvest

Apple’s India business grows in leaps! In FY24, Apple 's India operations witnessed a remarkable surge, reaching a value of over Rs 2 lakh crore ($23.5 billion), a significant increase from Rs 1.15 lakh crore in the previous year. A significant increase in iPhone production, along with strong domestic sales of MacBooks, iMacs, iPads, Watches, and AirPods, has boosted the value of Apple's operations in India.Top officials told ET that Apple's growth in production and exports in India over the last 50 years is likely the fastest and unparalleled by any other company, establishing the tech giant as the largest global value chain (GVC) operating within the country. Moreover, Apple is the first GVC in India to rapidly shift a portion of its supply chain away from China.The acceleration in Apple's operations in India can be attributed to the government's introduction of the smartphone production-linked incentive ( PLI ) scheme in 2020.In 2021, Apple began manufacturing iPhones in India, marking the first time the company produced iPhones outside of China. Since then, iPhone production in India has steadily increased through its three contract manufacturers – Foxconn, Wistron, and Pegatron – reaching Rs 1.20 lakh crore in FY24. The government provides incentives based on the freight on board (FOB) value at which the devices leave the factory, with market value or retail prices being 50-60% higher.The Economic Survey highlights India's contribution to Apple's overall production, which has risen to approximately 14%, positioning the country as a crucial hub for the company's global exports. In FY23, India's share was around 7%. iPhones constitute the majority of these figures, with exported iPhones valued at around Rs 1.35 lakh crore ($15 billion) in the last fiscal year, based on official data calculations.Domestic sales of Apple products in India reached approximately Rs 68,000 crore ($8 billion) in FY24. In FY23, Apple exported iPhones with a market value of Rs 66,000 crore. The company's market share in India, although steadily increasing from 2% in FY18, remains below 6% due to the dominance of the Android ecosystem, led by Chinese brands such as Vivo and Xiaomi. Additionally, India's revenue contribution to Apple's global revenue of $383 billion in FY23 was less than 2%.Also Read | Apple ecosystem becomes biggest blue-collar job creator in India! 1.5 lakh direct jobs created since PLI scheme India revenue figures of Apple do not include export numbers, but the increase in manufacturing by the Apple ecosystem has generated more than 150,000 direct jobs since 2021. The company's largest factory in India, operated by Foxconn, employs 41,000 individuals.During the third-quarter earnings call in August, Apple CEO Tim Cook announced that the company had achieved ""quarterly revenue records in more than two dozen countries and regions, including Canada, Mexico, France, Germany, the UK, India, Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand.""Despite Apple's success, smartphone shipments in India experienced a 2% year-on-year decline in the June quarter, according to Counterpoint Research. The market tracker attributed this decline to factors such as the heatwave, a seasonal slump, and a sequential slowdown in demand compared to the previous quarter.Recognizing the significance of India in the current geopolitical landscape, Cook visited the country in April last year to meet with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and inaugurate the first two company-owned retail stores in Delhi and Mumbai.During the earnings call in May, Cook emphasized the company's comprehensive approach to India, stating, ""the company was working on everything — from developers to markets and operations — in India.

The Indian Banks' Association (IBA) says, ""Banking Companies (Nomination) Rules 1985 permits banks to pay dues to nominees in the event of death of depositor(s) without asking for succession certificate or verifying claims of legal heirs. This simplifies settlement. Of course, as Trustee the nominee is accountable to legal heirs.The IBA further clarifies that the nomination facility is available for bank deposits, safe deposit lockers, and safe custody articles. A single deposit account, whether held individually or jointly, can have only one nominee. However, a jointly held locker can have two nominees. In the case of a minor's account, a person legally empowered to operate the account can file a nomination on behalf of the minor.The State Bank of India emphasizes the importance of availing the benefits of nomination facility and survivorship clause for locker-hirers. In the unfortunate event of the death of one of the joint locker-hirers, the contents of the locker do not automatically transfer to the surviving joint locker-hirer or nominee(s) unless there is a survivorship clause or nomination in place.When renting a locker, the bank charges a nominal annual rent based on the size of the locker and the location of the branch. The rent should be paid in advance for the financial year. The bank provides a copy of the signed Locker Agreement to the locker-hirer, outlining their rights and responsibilities.","The Banking Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2024 proposes to increase the number of nominees allowed per bank account and locker from one to four.

Car discounts galore! Car manufacturers and dealers are offering substantial discounts, including cash discounts, exchange bonuses, and additional benefits, even on popular models, in an effort to clear a significant inventory buildup caused by slowing sales.According to trade insiders, major automakers like Maruti Suzuki , Hyundai , Tata Motors , Skoda , and Honda are all providing cash discounts, exchange bonuses, and extra benefits on their popular models.Maruti Suzuki's average discount per vehicle increased by 50% to Rs 21,700 in the first quarter ended June, compared to Rs 14,500 in the last quarter of FY24, according to an ET report.Industry executives and dealers have reported that these discounts are among the highest seen in the local market since FY20, when promotional offers were rolled out to liquidate inventory before the transition to Bharat Stage VI emission standards.The industry started the fiscal year with normal stocks of around 300,000 vehicles, sufficient to meet demand for 30 days. However, sluggish sales led to an additional 100,000 units, prompting car makers and dealers to offer promotional schemes over the last four months, with benefits this month matching those in FY20. ""The discount levels now are among the highest I have ever seen in the market,"" an industry executive said on condition of anonymity.Passenger vehicle sales in the country reached a record high of 4.23 million last fiscal, partly due to pent-up demand after a global semiconductor crisis limited production for several months.However, sales have slowed down in the new fiscal year after three years of robust growth. A senior industry executive attributed the increased discounts to fewer launches this year compared to last year, when multiple SUVs were lined up ahead of the festive season and received a good response.Automakers and dealers are relying on the upcoming festive season, starting with Onam in Kerala next month, to boost market momentum. ""Kerala will be a harbinger of what we can expect during the festive season this year,"" said the senior industry executive.""If sales take off and inventory gets liquidated, wholesales will move. Or else, dealers may be hesitant to take more stocks. So far, vehicle sales in Kerala have been faring well due to inflow of remittances and better natural rubber prices.""","Maruti Suzuki's average discount per vehicle increased by 50% to Rs 21,700 in the first quarter ended June, compared to Rs 14,500 in the last quarter of FY24.

Of this, a huge chunk is on account of cases pending before court-appointed committees.Difficult to recover (DTR) dues are those that could not be recovered even after exhausting all modes of recovery.“Segregation of such DTR dues is purely an administrative act and this will not preclude the recovery officers from recovering the amount so segregated as DTR as and when there is a change in any of the DTR parameters,” Sebi said in its annual report for 2023-24.As of March 31, 2024, Sebi identified 807 cases as DTR, with a total outstanding of Rs 76,293 crore, up from 692 cases amounting to Rs 73,287 crore the previous year, according to the report. Among these 807 cases, 36 are pending due to ongoing proceedings in State PID courts, National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) involving Rs 12,199 crore.Additionally, 60 cases are before court-appointed committees, with Rs 59,970 crore at stake. These two categories together account for 95% of the total amount yet to be recovered.

Inflation Targeting Mandate: RBI's Policy Impact on Inflation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rbis-policy-impact-on-inflation/articleshow/112636654.cms,"NEW DELHI: The inflation targeting mandate to RBI has helped reduce inflation and made it less volatile, making monetary policy more effective, a new paper by two economists has said.The paper by Barry Eichengreen, a professor at UC Berkley and NCAER director general Poonam Gupta has suggested that govt should not change RBI’s mandate or tinker with the inflation tolerance band of 2-6%, arguing it would be “risky and counterproductive”.In recent weeks, especially since the release of the Economic Survey last month, there has been debate over targeting core inflation, excluding food. The paper, however, argued against it. “Our results indicate that food-price inflation feeds through to core inflation as producers mark up the prices of other products. Food-price inflation, which is captured by headline inflation, has predictive content for future core inflation, in other words, and should not be disregarded. Whereas central banks in advanced economies have been able to look through fluctuations in food and fuel price inflation, without consequences for core inflation and therefore without jeopardising their inflation targets, in India, where food is a much more important component of consumption baskets, this may not be the case.”Instead, it called for an urgent reworking of the weight assigned to food and beverages in the basket of goods that make up the consumer price index (CPI). Arguing that the per capita income has doubled since 2011-12, when the 45.8% weight was assigned, the paper suggested that a 40% weight should now be assigned now, which is likely to decline to 30% in a decade based on the per capita income projections.While RBI has a 4% inflation target as against 4.5% in Brazil, 3% in Indonesia and 1.5% in Thailand, the economists said, India has lower income and a faster-growing catch up economy and the current goal is appropriate.They also concluded that keeping inflation within a narrower band, than the current 2-6%, will require more frequent changes in policy rates. “Such variations might create a less predictable climate for investment and hence challenges for economic growth,” it said adding that the world was entering a period of heightened volatility.","The paper by Barry Eichengreen, a professor at UC Berkley and NCAER director general Poonam Gupta has suggested that govt should not change RBI’s mandate or tinker with the inflation tolerance band of 2-6%, arguing it would be “risky and counterproductive”","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112639080,imgsize-1645938,width-400,resizemode-4/112639080.jpg"
FM Nirmala Sitharaman pushes banks to launch deposit mobilisation drive,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/fm-nirmala-sitharaman-pushes-banks-to-launch-deposit-mobilisation-drive/articleshow/112636574.cms,"NEW DELHI/MUMBAI: Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Monday nudged state-run banks to step up deposit mobilisation and conduct special drives so that it can keep pace with the growth in loans.The minister's comments at a meeting with public sector bank chiefs came amid data by SBI Research suggesting that bank deposits, traditionally favoured for their safety and liquidity, are losing their appeal among younger investors.While deposits remain a secure investment option, their post-tax returns are falling short compared to riskier assets like mutual funds and equities.While seeking a review of the tax structure for bank deposits, SBI economists argued that nearly 47% of term deposits are now held by senior citizens , the report showed, indicating that the younger population is shifting away from conventional banking avenues. In contrast, the median age of investors in capital markets has dropped to 32 years, with approximately 40% of these investors being under 30.Most banks offer up to half a percentage point higher return to senior citizens. At the same time, most senior depositors can claim exemption from tax deduction at source. With lending growth remaining higher than deposits, RBI and the FM have underlined the need to immediately address the issue so that it does not result in a ""systemic risk"" in the future.At Monday's meeting, Sitharaman suggested that banks should work towards building a better relationship with customers by reaching out to them, especially in rural and semi-urban areas. The minister also pushed banks to strengthen their tech platforms to guard them against any cyber threat so that their systems are not compromised.""FM advised that issues of cyber security should be seen from a systemic perspective and emphasised that a collaborative approach between banks, govt, regulators and security agencies is needed to put in place necessary mitigants against cyber-risks. FM also urged that every aspect of the IT system should be reviewed periodically and thoroughly from the cyber security angle to ensure that the security of the bank systems is not breached or compromised,"" an official statement said.Sources said deposit mobilisation was a key theme. With stock markets performing better and mutual funds becoming a major investment tool, investors - especially in the younger age group - have opted out of fixed deposits. The tax treatment also makes them unfavourable.The SBI report recommended delinking the tax treatment from the highest income bracket and instead taxing deposits at the time of redemption rather than on an accrual basis. SBI's analysis also explores the impact of taxes on deposits, using data from 1970-71 to 2023-24. The findings reveal that if per capita income increases by Rs 1,000, bank deposits increase by Rs 613 when considering taxes as a factor. Without the tax impact, deposits could have risen by Rs 652, suggesting a 7% reduction due to taxation.According to the report, mutual fund investor accounts have grown nearly fivefold from a little under 4 crore in March 2014 to over 19 crore in June 2024. However, the number of unique investors has only increased marginally, suggesting that many investors are diversifying their portfolios across multiple mutual funds.","Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Monday nudged state-run banks to step up deposit mobilisation and conduct special drives. The minister's comments came amid data by SBI Research suggesting that bank deposits, traditionally favoured for their safety and liquidity, are losing their appeal among younger investors.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112636711,imgsize-691802,width-400,resizemode-4/112636711.jpg"

Railway Budget 2024 : The government has wavered little in its efforts to spur a modernisation of railways in the country, pivoting on technology, to support the country’s economic ambitions. In line with expectations, Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore, marking yet another year of successive increase in outlay.That takes forward the past policies and the government’s vision, which have paved the way for modernisation of the transport behemoth.In earlier decades, the government had focused on laying tracks on new routes, electrification and incremental rolling stock capacity addition. That was the need of the hour back then and has helped set up the base for a larger transformation.For instance, the massive Dedicated Freight Corridor ( DFC ) as well as locomotive factories at Marhaura and Madhepura in Bihar were conceptualised over a decade ago and we are seeing their completion now.More recently, the focus has shifted to modernisation—of rolling stock and safety systems, among other aspects.This year, emphasis has also been laid on the railways’ crucial role in industrial development. Commodity-specific corridors have been planned in eastern India and impetus given to port connectivity. Vande Bharat and technology-led upgrades in rolling stock remain in focus. Safety has been prioritised through budgetary allocations for the anti-collision systemKavach . That said, there are other cogs in the wheel that demand attention from a long-term perspective.First, the target for the Operating Ratio, the crucial efficiency gauge, has been set at 98.22% for 2024-25, compared with 98.65% in 2023-24. This reflects an imminent need for operational transformation. An effective overhaul of the world’s fourth-largest rail network will take many years and thus we need to start focusing on improving efficiency and reducing costs now.DFC is almost entirely operational and will be complete over the next few months. To ensure the project achieves its twin goals of reducing logistics costs and enhancing freight efficiency, railways need to attract more cargo on the corridor. This will help increase the rail coefficient and make the railways’ approach more market-oriented, which will in turn aid future corridors.A revamp of railway stations is on track, with sufficient funds dedicated to this end. But even though new coaches and wagons are increasingly being added to meet footfalls, the stations and passenger trains themselves remain synonymous with chaos.Just as safety, comfort and convenience have been prioritised, there is a need for solutions to address the capacity and demand challenges. As a first step, the government could target development of new stations and setting up of new coach production units.As a leading freight mover, Indian Railways carried a record 1,588 MT cargo in fiscal 2024, up from 1,095 MT in fiscal 2015. It accounts for 26% of the cargo moved in the country—by no means an easy feat. The railways aims to take this volume to 3,000 MT by 2030, which would require a 11% CAGR against the around 4.2% witnessed over the last 10 years. As per a report by TERI and Shakti Foundation, from carrying about 62% of freight traffic in 1990-91, Indian Railways’ share has declined to ~27% in 2014-15. This has been due to the expanding road network, cost competitiveness over railways, and door-to-door service. Thus, commencing the cycle of increasing the rail share again is commendable.DFCs, a high-capacity track network, high-power locomotives and improvement in wagon designs have set the ball rolling for larger capacity, faster freight trains that deliver better efficiency.Yet, achieving exponential growth is a tall ask given the current dynamics. Possibly, similar challenges might apply to other goals the railways might have for 2047.To be fair, despite its scale and complexity, Indian Railways has been able to achieve diverse developments at commendable speed.But the track ahead is long and it is time to start discussing the reinvention of the institutional set-up.Indian Railways sees substantial private sector involvement in the form of vendors and contractors. Policymakers could start mulling extreme options such as parallel privately-owned and operated railway infrastructure, coupled with centralised planning and an evolved role for the railways. This will need a robust policy framework from the Government of India.The time is perhaps also ripe to bring user charge and asset monetisation-driven segments for passengers as well as cargo to the discussion table. Globally, the separation of infrastructure and operations in railways has delivered mixed results, for example in the United Kingdom. The model should be analysed and revisited to understand its potential relevance in the Indian context.The key would be to retrace our steps and align our long-term goals to identify not just incremental changes but also ways to explore bold and path-breaking alternatives that put Indian Railways on a smooth track and bring it up to speed.","Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore.

Budget 2024 capital gains tax changes: The Narendra Modi government is considering suggestions for tweaks in the new long term capital gains tax regime that was announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman in Union Budget 2024.The July 23 budget reduced the LTCG tax on property from 20% to 12.5%. The indexation benefit, which allowed taxpayers to adjust the acquisition cost for inflation before calculating capital gains and thus reduce their tax liability, is proposed to be eliminated for properties purchased on or after April 1, 2001.The government publishes the Cost Inflation Index (CII) annually for this calculation.India Inc is appealing to the government for a gradual shift to the long-term capital gains tax regime proposed in the FY25 budget, which aims to eliminate indexation benefits for property, gold, and other unlisted assets.According to an ET report by Deepshikha Sikarwar, the industry is suggesting alternatives such as a higher tax rate with indexation or a lower rate of 12.5% without indexation, as well as some form of grandfathering for ancestral properties.The finance ministry is currently reviewing these proposals and will discuss them with the Prime Minister's Office. The final decision will be made closer to the date when the Finance Bill reply is to be presented in Parliament, the reports said.Industry groups are expected to submit formal proposals to the finance ministry in the near future.

Budget 2024 for manufacturing sector : The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth. While the middle class has been offered tax relief, the government's primary focus remains on judicious spending to maximize economic impact. The budget's core themes are employment, skilling, MSME development, and support for the middle class.Largely focus has remained intact on spending money judiciously to ensure that each penny spent creates a ripple effect in the entire economic landscape.Although at first glance, manufacturing might appear to have taken a backseat, a deeper analysis reveals a multifaceted approach to bolstering the sector. Initiatives like employment-linked benefits and internship programs, while primarily aimed at job creation and skill development, indirectly benefit manufacturing companies by expanding the talent pool.Extensive focus on the MSME manufacturing units by way of extending term loan facility for purchase of machinery and equipment without collateral or third-party guarantee, would help companies in augmenting their capital base/ capacity and strengthen the very foundation of the manufacturing ecosystem in the country. Development of a new credit-assessment model by Public Sector Banks to assess MSME credit shall provide much needed regulatory relief to the units.With respect to the large manufacturing entities, while there is no direct fiscal/ tax incentive introduced in this budget, some support has been provided with an extensive focus on development of ‘industrial parks’ in nearly 100 cities under the ‘plug and play’ model. Reforms proposed with respect to land administration, planning and management, shall also ease out acquisition related difficulties often faced by entrepreneurs/ business houses in acquiring lands for manufacturing set-ups.Targeted Customs duty interventions like, rationalization of Customs duty provisions in Mobile phone manufacturing setups, extension of Customs duty exemption on import of capital goods for manufacturing of solar cells and panels, full Customs duty exemption on import of 25 critical minerals,, shall provide the required impetus for enhancing domestic manufacturing environment.Governments’ focus on formulating an Economic Policy Framework to set the scope for next-gen reforms in the country, has a target to improve the productivity of factors of production, namely, land, labour, capital, entrepreneurship and technology. This shall pave the way for enabling achievement of a target of 25% manufacturing sector contribution to the nation’s GDP over the course of next 7-10 years.While the overall outlook is positive, the extension of tax benefits under Section 115BAB for manufacturing entities and the absence of new PLI schemes are notable omissions.The country’s manufacturing base is expanding as is reflective from the continuously increasing tax collections and expanding Purchasing Manager’s Index. It would be pertinent to see how the ground realities evolve vis-à-vis the vision envisaged, in the upcoming Financial Year.","The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth.

Budget 2024: Armed with the vision to propel India to become a developed country by 2047, the Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business thereby providing the required stimulus to the manufacturing sector and enabling large scale job creation.On the Indirect tax front, the industry welcomes the much-needed announcement for a comprehensive review of the rate structure under Customs enabling ease in product classification and dispute reduction. The proposal of lowering of Customs duty on a plethora of raw materials and products including solar cells, critical minerals and bullion are encouraging measures. The rationale behind such reduction clearly indicates support towards domestic manufacturing, deepening value addition and supporting targets in reducing carbon footprint.Relevant amendments under the Customs law have been made to provide increased time limits for re-imports and re-exports to enhance competitiveness of the fledgling MRO sector. The government has extended significant duty reduction and exemption benefits to the healthcare and electronics sectors, continuing the impetus of incentives provided under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme.Since their introduction in March 2020, the PLI schemes have indeed supported in revitalizing the manufacturing sector and strengthening the necessary supply chains. The success achieved in the mobile manufacturing sector has now enabled the Government to reduce customs duties on mobile phones and components, signalling a mature environment. The Budget proposals aim at reproducing similar outcomes for semiconductor and pharmaceutical industry by increasing the budgetary allocation.Buoyed by the increasing revenue collection under GST signalling a shift towards a mature tax regime, this Budget has harmonized the timeframes for the issuance of demand notices and adjudication orders for cases involving fraud, suppression or otherwise. Significant amendments to the GST legislations have been introduced reflecting the recommendations proposed by the GST Council such as regularizing non-levy of GST due to general practice which may turn out to be a breather for certain impacted industries reeling under huge tax demands.The Insurance sector has been provided much relief through the GST council recommendations which have been cemented in the present budget thereby ending long standing disputes on their business practices.The Government's efforts to push forward with its reform agenda are evident as plans to incentivize states for their business reform actions plans and digitalization through the Jan Vishwas Bill 2.0 is proposed. Further, setting up of e-commerce export hubs is envisaged to facilitate easier access to international markets for domestic players.The recent implementation of Budget proposals allows the government to maintain momentum in its reform agenda. These policy measures implicitly reaffirm the significance of India Inc as a crucial element in the development of infrastructure. However, there are still some expectations required to be met to march towards a Viksit Bharat 2047.",The Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business.

Budget 2024 : Real estate, a significant contributor to employment generation, has received a fair bit of attention in Budget 2024-25. Recent years have seen the sector transform rapidly, driven by factors such as favourable government policies, Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, strong economic growth and changing consumer preferences.Added to that, the budgetary focus on job creation, skilling and employment-linked incentives, infrastructure, urban development, rural connectivity, digitalisation and land-related norms, all dovetail to promote growth of the sector.Launched in June 2015, the PMAY aims to provide affordable housing to all eligible beneficiaries. The budget unveiled PMAY Urban 2.0, under which the housing needs of 1 crore urban poor and middle class will be addressed with an investment of Rs 10 lakh crore.The central government’s additional Rs 2.2 lakh crore injection in the next 5 years to make housing more affordable has the potential to revitalise the affordable housing market.Such an approach can play an important role in realising the government's vision of Housing for All and push growth and development. Hence, the significant investment under PMAY Urban 2.0 is expected to alleviate urban housing deficits, spurring construction and economic growth.Steps to introduce technological reforms within the regulatory framework for land, such as digitalisation or GIS mapping of land records, will improve transparency.Rationalisation of stamp duty across states will also be critical to bring in uniformity and initiate land-related reforms such as urban planning, usage and building bylaws.These are steps in the right direction and will boost growth. Moreover, they will improve the ease of property transactions and strengthen municipal finances through increased property taxes. Rationalization of stamp duty with an emphasis on women homebuyers may boost home-buyer sentiment in major cities, too.The budget has also given ample attention to urban and rural development, with rental housing for industrial workers through the public private partnership model, interest subsidies for rental housing, and transit-oriented developments.The proposal to develop investment-ready plug-and-play industrial parks in 100 cities may attract industrial investment, leading to increased demand for industrial real estate and support the growth of ancillary services and residential developments in these regions.Initiatives for industrial parks and rental housing for industrial workers align with the country’s manufacturing goals and addresses worker accommodation needs.These steps are expected to promote industrial growth and stability in labour-intensive sectors, while also creating new opportunities for real estate developers specialising in rental and affordable housing.The changes in long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax, however, have evoked a mixed reaction. The government lowered the long-term capital gains tax from 20% to 12.5%, which is a welcome step. However, this came with the removal of the indexation benefit.The changes could encourage more liquidity in property transactions and potentially increase the effective tax burden depending on the property’s acquisition date.The launch of Phase IV of the PM Gram Sadak Yojana in 25,000 rural habitations will improve connectivity in rural areas, promoting rural development and making these regions more accessible for investment. The primary objective of PMGSY is to build robust, all-weather roads in rural habitations. This initiative focuses on enhancing connectivity and supporting economic development in rural areas.In essence, the budget is geared towards stimulating growth and investment in the real estate sector , fostering a more transparent and investor-friendly environment, and contributing to overall development. It aims to create a balanced and inclusive growth environment by addressing the needs of various segments, including affordable housing, industrial workers and urban infrastructure.The effectiveness of the initiatives, however, hinges on their implementation and continued support of complementary reforms.","Budget 2024-25 is geared towards stimulating growth and investment in the real estate sector.

New Budget 2024 rule: Why Income Tax Department is likely to issue a huge number of tax notices this month,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-budget-2024-rule-why-income-tax-department-is-likely-to-issue-a-huge-number-of-tax-notices-this-month/articleshow/112186079.cms,"Taxing Times

Income Tax Notice on the way? The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month, as there are concerns that many taxpayers might escape the tax net due to the impending implementation of the new reassessment law on September 1, 2024.According to the amended regulation announced in Budget 2024 , the tax authorities can only go back a maximum of five years to reassess a taxpayer's records if the escaped income is at least Rs 50 lakh, and three years for an amount less than Rs 50 lakh.Previously, they could reassess cases up to 10 years old.According to an ET report, tax officials are now faced with the challenge of compiling and corroborating data on tax and income mismatches for the financial years 2013-14 to 2017-18 within the next few weeks, as these years will become time-barred for reassessment from September 1, 2024.The I-T department relies on information from various sources, such as banks, property registrars, and search findings from the investigation wing, to build reassessment cases.A tax officers' body has raised concerns about the feasibility of issuing notices under Section 148 (or 148A) in a large number of cases within a single month, given the overburdened nature of the jurisdictional assessing officers and the time-consuming process of obtaining sanction from the chief commissioner, who is the specified authority for such notices.Moreover, the law provides taxpayers with the right to explain their position before reassessment orders are finalized, a process that most believe cannot be completed by the end of August.Also Read | ITR refund status for FY 2023-24: How to check income tax refund status online - here’s a step-by-step guide for incometax.gov.in & NSDL websites The Central Board of Direct Taxes ( CBDT ) has been urged by its officers to postpone the effective date of the proposed amendment. However, this suggestion is unlikely to be well-received by corporations and high net worth individuals.""Capping the reassessment period at five years was a great decision as it would reduce hassles and litigation. But if the department fears there could be a genuine loss of revenue as it may not be possible to wrap up several matters by August 31, the government can think of strict parameters where time-bound cases can be selectively reopened - based on trails of steps taken in identifying escaped income,"" said Mitil Chokshi, partner at CA firm Chokshi & Chokshi.""Taxpayers may expect a rush of reassessment notices in August 2024. These notices are likely to be for the AYs 2018-19 and prior to that. It is pertinent to note that the Bombay High Court in a recent ruling in a case of Hexaware Technologies has taken a view on a proviso introduced in 2021, which can be interpreted to mean that AY 2017-18 (and prior years) got time barred on March 31, 2024. These reassessment notices (for AYs 2017-18 and prior) are likely to rake up new interpretation issues in the already muddled reassessment provisions,"" said Ashish Mehta, partner at law firm Khaitan & Co.The current situation is similar to the conflict between the Income Tax office and taxpayers in 2021. The reassessment law was amended in April 2021, allowing the tax office to reopen 10-year-old tax returns if the total undisclosed income exceeded Rs 50 lakh and reassess 4-year-old matters if the amount was less than Rs 50 lakh.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? However, this change led to over 10,000 writ petitions being filed by companies, arguing that they were not given sufficient time to explain and that the notices were issued without considering the carve-out that cases which couldn't be reopened earlier couldn't be reassessed under the new law.The Supreme Court invoked its extraordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution on May 4, 2022, to uphold all reassessment notices issued after March 31, 2021. However, the court left room for judicial proceedings based on the merits of each case, and several such matters are currently pending before the court.","The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month.

Ten years later, the Union Budget 2024 presented by us a few days ago is Rs 48 lakh crore, which is three times, Modi said.Modi also said that the capital expenditure allocation under his governments has grown manifold.""Capital expenditure is called the biggest productive medium of resource investment,"" he said at the ‘Journey Towards Viksit Bharat: A Post Union Budget 2024-25' conference. In 2004, the capex allocation of UPA’s first Budget was Rs 90,000 crore. This increased to only Rs 2 lakh crore in the last UPA budget in 2014, Modi said. At present the capex allocation is over Rs 11 lakh crore, Modi added. Modi pointed out that the capex allocation of railways and highways has become 8 times under his government.PM Modi said that India, which is currently the world’s fifth largest economy, will soon become the third largest.

Are NPS Vatsalya & hiked NPS deduction limit for private sector employees good moves from Budget 2024?

NPS and EPF: Overlapping services

What is NPS Vatsalaya?

Latest NPS rules, news: In the Union Budget 2024 speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced two new initiatives with regard to National Pension Scheme (NPS) - extension of NPS 14% employer contribution benefits to private setcor and the intended launch of NPS Vatsalya.Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries, bringing it at par with the provisions available for government employees.Sriram Iyer, CEO, HDFC Pension Management told ET that with this move the “ground rules have been harmonised among government and non-government employees, which is a positive step.”Effectively, this means that now, private-sector employees can choose to reduce the taxable portion of employers’ contribution to their NPS corpus, thereby paying less tax and leaving greater funds in their pension deposits.“Employees will benefit from tax savings . More importantly, the 40% increase in contribution will have a significant impact on the terminal value of the retirement corpus,” remarked Iyer. The extended savings will “help in retirement planning, working as an option that is at par with the Provident Fund,” Dinesh Rohira, CEO & Founder, 5nance.com was quoted as saying.Moreover, the endeavour aims to increase NPS penetration by increasing tax incentives for the private sector, providing them a social security-cushion post-retirement.The scheme’s motive to widen the NPS subscriber base may not prove to be flawlessly effective, however. This is explained by Agrees Mrin Agarwal, Founder, Finsafe India: “While it’s good that the limit has been raised, it may not increase adoption as employees need to be educated in a big way. Also, the benefit is only for the salaried opting for the new tax regime,” she says.The mandatory contribution to the EPF, too, threatens to relegate the provisions of NPS under the umbrella of near-superfluity. This sentiment is echoed by Varun Sahay, a software engineer in a Delhi-based IT company: “When 12% of my salary is already deducted for the EPF, why should I put in more in the NPS and cut my take-home pay?”Rohira feels otherwise. “There’s no competition between the NPS and EPF as employees can contribute to both and build a 3-4 times bigger corpus while earning 3-4% higher returns via marketlinked options in the NPS,” he counters.Also Check | New Tax Regime 2023 vs 2024 After Budget: How Much Income Tax Will Salaried Taxpayers Save & How Do New Tax Slabs Compare To Old Regime? Top 10 Points You Must Know To jumpstart retirement savings for children, a new initiative called NPS Vatsalya has been unveiled in the Budget. This scheme allows parents and guardians to contribute to a minor's account, which can be converted into a regular NPS account once the child reaches adulthood.""It provides a very long duration for reaping the compounding benefits and accumulating a huge bounty at a later age. This can be a good way to plan a better future for kids who may not opt for a service segment in the future,"" says Rohira. Sriram Iyer agrees, stating, ""It’s a good move to help the child start his retirement journey. Even if a parent starts when the child is 10 years old, by the time he starts working, it can be a solid foundation for the compounding journey after that.""However, some experts question the utility of a product with such a long lock-in period, especially when parents cannot use the funds for essential goals like their child’s education amidst soaring education costs of 11-12%.""Parents are struggling to save for their own retirement, so it might be a bit of a stretch to expect them to save for their kids’ retirement. The need of the hour is a market-linked product that allows withdrawals only for the child’s education,"" says Mrin Agarwal, Founder of Finsafe India.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? Though the NPS permits partial withdrawals, it allows only 25% of the corpus after three years of joining, and this can be done only three times during the entire tenure. A premature exit before 60 years with 100% withdrawal is only possible if the corpus is less than Rs.2.5 lakh, an amount insufficient for most children's goals.""In its current form, there won’t be any uptake,"" asserts Agarwal. Rohira concurs, ""It’s a vanilla product with a lock-in, which does not make it very attractive and it may not take off. However, the government may optimise it and introduce new features later."" Iyer adds, ""This is just a start and there may be more subscriber-friendly features as we take it to the market. The regulator is proactive and open to feedback.""","Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries.

Gold import duty cut: Why Indians may not find buying gold from Dubai as attractive post Budget 2024,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-import-duty-cut-why-indians-may-not-find-buying-gold-from-dubai-as-attractive-post-budget-2024/articleshow/112097671.cms,"Gold import duty cut in Budget 2024: The recent reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai. Indian jewellers with stores in both India and the UAE believe that the narrowed duty differential will result in lower gold prices in India, making it less attractive for Indians to purchase gold in Dubai.The emirate had attracted gold-enthusiast Indians following a steep rise in customs duty in India in July 2022. In the fiscal 2024-25 budget, the duty on gold imports was more than halved.The duty cut is also expected to boost gold jewellery production in India, particularly the popular 'Kolkatti' jewellery from Kolkata, which is favored by Indian expats in Dubai and tourists from various countries. This move will encourage gold artisans to create new designs in both heavyweight and lightweight jewellery, attracting consumers to purchase gold from India.According to an ET report, Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group , estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India as Indian tourists who previously bought jewellery in Dubai will now prefer to shop in India. However, Indian expats living in Dubai and other customers may continue to buy from the UAE.Also Read | Gold losing sheen? Government cuts gold bond issuance target as investors look at better alternatives Rajiv Popley, director at Popley & Sons, believes that the perception of overseas gold being cheaper than in India is merely a mindset. He points out that the labour cost is significantly lower in India, and with the introduction of mandatory hallmarking and HUID numbers, the purity of gold in India is no longer a concern.Furthermore, NRIs in Dubai do not receive VAT refunds, and Indians travelling abroad only receive about 60% of the VAT back on their gold purchases. Gold trade analyst Bhargav Baidya suggests that the 1% duty differential between gold jewellery in India and Dubai will be offset by Indian jewellers offering discounts to retain and attract customers.Saurabh Gadgil, chairman of PNG Jewellers, notes that Indian import duty is now on par with the US, allowing Indian jewellers to offer competitive prices compared to other countries worldwide. The reduced customs duty is expected to make gold purchases in India more attractive and convenient for Indian consumers, potentially leading to a significant shift in their gold shopping preferences.",The reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai.

Gold losing sheen? The government has reduced its target for issuing gold bonds in the financial year 2024-25 by 38% compared to the previous interim budget goal, according to a senior official. The revised target stands at Rs 18,500 crore, down from Rs 29,638 crore estimated in the interim budget and Rs 26,852 crore (revised estimate) in 2023-24.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told ET ""The decision followed a reassessment of various factors, including investor demand, other investment products and uncertainties around the global economy, as the situation has changed since the interim budget in February.""After accounting for redemptions, the net issuances of sovereign gold bonds are now estimated at Rs 15,000 crore for this fiscal year, a significant decrease from the Rs 26,138 crore projected in the interim budget and Rs 25,352 crore in the revised estimate for 2023-24.Harish Galipelli, director at ILA Commodities India, attributed this shift to retail investors increasingly opting for equities in anticipation of better returns. He also noted that people are uncertain about the potential for further increases in gold prices in the short-to-medium term following a recent rally. Additionally, Galipelli pointed out that savings in rural areas have been impacted by retail inflation and other factors.The gold bond and gold monetisation schemes were introduced by the government in late 2015 to discourage the physical purchase of precious metals and reduce imports, thereby mitigating the negative impact on the current account deficit.The gross collection through these two schemes is now projected to be Rs 20,030 crore in 2024-25, compared to Rs 31,168 crore in the interim budget and Rs 28,240 crore (revised estimate) in the previous fiscal year. Similarly, the net collection is estimated at Rs 16,433 crore, down from Rs 27,571 crore in the interim budget and Rs 26,653 crore in the previous year. However, the estimates for the gold monetisation scheme remain unchanged from the interim budget level.Also Read | Budget 2024: Duty cuts on gold, silver, platinum, and diamonds to make jewellery more affordable The sovereign gold bond scheme targets investors who view gold as an investment, encouraging them to purchase paper gold instead of physical gold.On the other hand, the gold monetisation scheme aims to bring out idle gold held by households, temple trusts, and others to increase domestic supply. Both schemes were designed to curb gold imports, which, along with crude oil, have been significant contributors to India's current account deficit.

But, these sales mostly offer lower fares on flights that do not see much demand,” said Anil Kalsi, VP, Travel Agents Federation of India.To be sure, India continues to have a very high-cost operating environment for airlines especially due to jet fuel prices. A weaker rupee adds to the equation as significant part of airlines’ costs are dollar-denominated like lease rentals. With two mega airlines, India’s aviation landscape has changed from earlier fight for market share by offering low (often below cost) airfares — that eventually led to collapse of big airlines like Kingfisher and Jet (GoAir was a different story) — to now what airlines call “pricing discipline” of not repeating that mistake.India now has two well-funded mega airlines — Tata-backed Air India-led group and IndiGo — that between them have 91% of domestic market share.","Last month saw almost 1.3 crore passengers flew within in the country, 7.3% more than July 2023, DGCA data showed.

Adani has repeatedly denied these claims.Adani Group’s gross debt stood at 2.41 trillion rupees at the end of the quarter.","Billionaire Gautam Adani ’s group said its cash balance accounted for 24.8% of gross debt.

Tackling illicit financial flows – a key area for UN’s tax framework,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/tackling-illicit-financial-flows-a-key-area-for-uns-tax-framework/articleshow/112589917.cms,"MUMBAI: India was among the 110 countries that voted, on Friday, in favour of adopting the ‘ Terms of Reference ‘ for a United Nations (UN) Framework on international tax co-operation .As was reported by TOI earlier, under the UN Framework developing countries – African and Asian countries (including India) are likely to have a greater say in the formulation of global tax rules .In Nov 2022, the UN General Assembly had unanimously adopted a resolution that called for developing an international tax co-operation framework or instrument that is developed and agreed upon through an UN intergovernmental process.The Terms of Reference have now been decided and approved by a UN ad hoc intergovernmental committee. These terms will now be presented to the UN General Assembly in late November or early December, for final approval.A key term of reference which India and several countries wanted on board was addressing tax-related illicit financial flows , tax avoidance , tax evasion and harmful tax practices. Other points of reference are a fair allocation of taxing rights, including equitable taxation of multinational enterprises – which tax experts and government officials view would be favourable to India; addressing tax evasion and avoidance by high-net worth individuals and ensuring their effective taxation in relevant countries; effective mutual administrative assistance in tax matters, including with respect to transparency and exchange of information for tax purposes; and effective prevention and resolution of tax disputes.USA, UK, Canada, Israel, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and Republic of Korea were the eight countries that voted against adopting the Terms of Reference. 44 countries which include Switzerland and primarily various EU countries abstained from voting. The 110 votes in favour are seen as a thumping majority and a clear shift in international tax policy making from the OECD (whose 38 members are dominated by rich nations) to a more broad based and equitable platform of the UN.The Tax Justice Network, a think-tank, has welcomed this development. It had earlier pointed out that OECD-member countries with their territorial dependencies, are estimated to be responsible for nearly 78% of the $ 480 billion in tax losses suffered by countries across the globe. It had added that the world would lose nearly $ 5 trillion to tax havens over the next decade unless the UN tax convention was adopted.","India was among the 110 countries that voted, on Friday, in favour of adopting the ‘ Terms of Reference ‘ for a United Nations (UN) Framework on international tax co-operation.
