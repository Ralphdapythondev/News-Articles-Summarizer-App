US Fed rate cut meeting date and time: How much interest cut is likely?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-fed-rate-cut-meeting-date-and-time-how-much-interest-cut-is-likely/articleshow/113402530.cms,"US Federal Reserve Meeting Time

The US Federal Reserve is expected to announce its first interest rate cut in over four years on Wednesday after the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting scheduled on September 17-18. Earlier, top Fed officials including chair Jerome Powell have signaled that a rate cut is imminent, as inflation moves closer to the bank's long-term goal of two percent.The debate among policymakers during their meetings on Tuesday and Wednesday will likely be whether to lower rates by 25 or 50 basis points. Experts believe that the smaller cut is the more prudent choice.""We expect the Fed to cut by 25bp (basis points),"" economists at Bank of America wrote in a recent note to clients. ""The Fed likes predictability. It's good for markets, good for consumers, good for workers,"" said Modestino from Northeastern.""So a 25 basis point cut now, followed up by another 25 basis point cut in November after the next round of economic data, offers a somewhat smoother glide path for the economy,"" Modestino added.The Fed Chair Jerome Powell will announce the outcome of the FOMC meet on Wednesday, September 18 around 11:30 PM Indian Standard Time (IST).The Federal Reserve is anticipated to implement a series of interest rate reductions in the upcoming meetings, according to economists from various banks. While some, such as those at Goldman Sachs, predict a total cut of 75 basis points spread across the final three meetings of the year, others, like the economists at Citi, have a more aggressive outlook, with their base case involving 125 basis points of easing.Traders also expect a probability exceeding 99 percent to the occurrence of at least four additional rate cuts in 2025. These cuts would result in the Fed's key lending rate falling to a range between 3.5 and 3.75 percent, representing a decrease of 175 basis points from the current levels.This will be the Fed's first rate cut since March 2020, when it drastically reduced rates to near-zero to bolster the US economy during the Covid-19 pandemic.The Fed began increasing rates in 2022 in response to a sharp increase in inflation, primarily caused by post-pandemic supply shortages and the conflict in Ukraine. Since then, it has maintained its key lending rate at a 20-year high of between 5.25 and 5.50 percent for the last 14 months, awaiting improvements in economic conditions.",The US Federal Reserve is expected to announce its first interest rate cut in over four years on Wednesday.

EY staffer's death puts focus on work stress,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/ey-staffers-death-puts-focus-on-work-stress/articleshow/113472876.cms,"Will recommit to providing supportive work environment: EY India chairman

BENGALURU: Amid the furore over the tragic demise of Anna Sebastian Perayil, an employee at consulting firm EY in Pune, allegedly because of work pressure , HR leaders emphasised the need for India Inc to relook at employee well-being .The uproar was triggered by a lengthy letter written by Anna's mother Anita Augustine to Memani that went viral on social media on Wednesday.Augustine voiced her concerns regarding the excessive workload placed on her daughter, a newcomer to the company, and indicated that Anna ultimately succumbed to work-related stress. Anna had joined the company in March, after completing CA, and passed away on July 20.On social media, a number of employees narrated experiences of work-related stress in previous jobs that led them to leave those jobs. One of them, Shashikiran Devadiga, said on X: ""No amount of money could compensate for a toxic workplace culture. India should learn a thing or two from the American or European work cultures."" Shweta Saboo, a CA and consultant at a startup, said what happened to Anna could have happened to her at a previous job if she hadn't quit. ""It's high time to stop glorifying slogging at the workplace. At the same time, we have to take charge of our well being as really nobody cares about it,"" she said.A manager at food-delivery platform Zomato said on LinkedIn that his manager pressured him to complete pending tasks even while he was on leave attending to his wife, who was suffering from dengue. The employee wondered whether this behaviour stemmed from the manager or higher management. A Zomato spokesperson, in response to TOI's queries, said that the company has relaxed policies around leaves, including infinite sick leaves. ""We are a large organisation, and there might be cases where some team leaders lack empathy, and force their employees to work during moments of health crises in their families. It is impossible to avoid such cases, but we make sure that we coach, or weed out such team leaders from the organisation when any such issue comes to light,"" he added.Some noted that Anna's death marks the second such case in six months, pointing to the death from suicide of Saurabh Laddha, a 25-year-old employee at another high-profile global consulting company, reportedly due to overwhelming work pressure. Work pressures are seen to be rising across India Inc, with many trying to do more with fewer resources. Amogh Deshmukh, head of the leadership practice at SHRM, says change must originate from the top management. ""The top management should have a human element in them. Only then will it trickle down and employees will have a real work-life balance,"" he says.Amit Jain, CEO of HR solutions firm TeamLease HCM, says not all companies have a hustle culture, but in no case should employee well-being be overlooked. Aditya Mishra, MD of HR services firm CIEL HR, says burnout is more a result of the pressure to perform rather than the number of work hours. ""Unrealistic expectations and the pressure to keep up with peers drive employees to work long hours,"" he says.This trend is not unique to India. Contrary to what Shashikiran Devadiga says, significant parts of the US corporate world suffer from similar problems. In May, Leo Lukenas, a 35-year-old employee at Bank of America, died after suffering a blood clot, but the media noted that he had been trying to quit the job because of the extreme hours he had been working - sometimes over 100 hours per week - and indicated that this may have caused his health problem.Following this, JPMorgan has reportedly started limiting junior banker hours to 80 per week, a first for it. And Bank of America, where these hours are already capped at 80, is launching an internal platform that closely monitors individual workloads, the Wall Street Journal reported.EY India chairman Rajiv Memani, in a message to the company's employees, said he had received an anguished email from Anna Sebastian Perayil's mother and had taken note of her message ""with utmost seriousness and humility."" Memani said the firm places the highest importance on the health and well-being of its people, and will recommit itself to providing a supportive, healthy, and balanced work environment to all. ""I would like to make this an ongoing dialogue with you to ensure we are continually building a healthy workplace for everyone. We have several well-being programmes and open channels of communication available in the firm to ensure that you always have a safe space to voice your concerns anonymously...,"" he said.","Anna Sebastian Perayil, an employee at consulting firm EY in Pune, died allegedly because of work pressure.

US stocks dip despite larger Fed interest rate cut,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-stocks-dip-despite-larger-fed-interest-rate-cut/articleshow/113473355.cms,"On Wednesday, Wall Street stocks experienced a slight decline following the Federal Reserve's announcement of a half-percentage-point interest rate cut. The central bank's chair, Jerome Powell , assured a ""careful"" approach to lowering rates, acknowledging the progress made in combating inflation in the United States.The Federal Reserve's decision was supported by an 11-to-1 vote in favor of reducing the benchmark rate to a range between 4.75 percent and 5.00 percent.The larger-than-expected rate cut surprised some analysts who had anticipated a quarter-point decrease. Additionally, policymakers projected an extra half-point of cuts by the end of this year and a further percentage point of cuts in 2025.Meanwhile, major US stock indices fluctuated between positive and negative territory following the Fed's decision. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 103.08 points, or 0.25%, to 41,503.10, the S&P 500 lost 16.32 points, or 0.29%, to 5,618.26 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 54.76 points, or 0.31%, to 17,573.30. Briefing.com noted that the Fed's decision would be met ""with both elation and criticism,"" as the larger rate cut could appease those who believe the Fed is lagging in preventing a hard landing. However, it may also face criticism from those who think the more aggressive rate cut was unwarranted given broader economic trends, with concerns that it could reignite inflation.During a news conference, Powell described the US economy as being in ""good shape,"" highlighting lower inflation and robust growth. He emphasized the Fed's desire to maintain a strong labor market. The decision to implement a larger rate cut was based on various economic data points, leading policymakers to conclude that monetary decisions had been ""appropriately restrictive"" and that a ""more neutral"" approach was now necessary. Powell signaled that investors should expect more interest rate cuts in the future but cautioned that the central bank would proceed carefully and evaluate the matter ""meeting by meeting.""In Europe, stock markets in Paris and London closed lower, while Frankfurt ended the day flat. The dollar initially experienced a significant drop against the euro and other currencies but later recovered. The Fed now anticipates only a half-percentage point of cuts remaining in 2024, which is lower than the three-quarter percentage point that traders had been expecting. Traders are now focusing on the upcoming announcement by the Bank of England on Thursday. The central bank is expected to maintain its current stance following a regular meeting, as official data released on Wednesday showed that British annual inflation remained at 2.2 percent in August.(With inputs from agencies)","The Federal Reserve announced a half-percentage-point interest rate cut on Wednesday.

Railway Budget 2024 : The government has wavered little in its efforts to spur a modernisation of railways in the country, pivoting on technology, to support the country’s economic ambitions. In line with expectations, Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore, marking yet another year of successive increase in outlay.That takes forward the past policies and the government’s vision, which have paved the way for modernisation of the transport behemoth.In earlier decades, the government had focused on laying tracks on new routes, electrification and incremental rolling stock capacity addition. That was the need of the hour back then and has helped set up the base for a larger transformation.For instance, the massive Dedicated Freight Corridor ( DFC ) as well as locomotive factories at Marhaura and Madhepura in Bihar were conceptualised over a decade ago and we are seeing their completion now.More recently, the focus has shifted to modernisation—of rolling stock and safety systems, among other aspects.This year, emphasis has also been laid on the railways’ crucial role in industrial development. Commodity-specific corridors have been planned in eastern India and impetus given to port connectivity. Vande Bharat and technology-led upgrades in rolling stock remain in focus. Safety has been prioritised through budgetary allocations for the anti-collision systemKavach . That said, there are other cogs in the wheel that demand attention from a long-term perspective.First, the target for the Operating Ratio, the crucial efficiency gauge, has been set at 98.22% for 2024-25, compared with 98.65% in 2023-24. This reflects an imminent need for operational transformation. An effective overhaul of the world’s fourth-largest rail network will take many years and thus we need to start focusing on improving efficiency and reducing costs now.DFC is almost entirely operational and will be complete over the next few months. To ensure the project achieves its twin goals of reducing logistics costs and enhancing freight efficiency, railways need to attract more cargo on the corridor. This will help increase the rail coefficient and make the railways’ approach more market-oriented, which will in turn aid future corridors.A revamp of railway stations is on track, with sufficient funds dedicated to this end. But even though new coaches and wagons are increasingly being added to meet footfalls, the stations and passenger trains themselves remain synonymous with chaos.Just as safety, comfort and convenience have been prioritised, there is a need for solutions to address the capacity and demand challenges. As a first step, the government could target development of new stations and setting up of new coach production units.As a leading freight mover, Indian Railways carried a record 1,588 MT cargo in fiscal 2024, up from 1,095 MT in fiscal 2015. It accounts for 26% of the cargo moved in the country—by no means an easy feat. The railways aims to take this volume to 3,000 MT by 2030, which would require a 11% CAGR against the around 4.2% witnessed over the last 10 years. As per a report by TERI and Shakti Foundation, from carrying about 62% of freight traffic in 1990-91, Indian Railways’ share has declined to ~27% in 2014-15. This has been due to the expanding road network, cost competitiveness over railways, and door-to-door service. Thus, commencing the cycle of increasing the rail share again is commendable.DFCs, a high-capacity track network, high-power locomotives and improvement in wagon designs have set the ball rolling for larger capacity, faster freight trains that deliver better efficiency.Yet, achieving exponential growth is a tall ask given the current dynamics. Possibly, similar challenges might apply to other goals the railways might have for 2047.To be fair, despite its scale and complexity, Indian Railways has been able to achieve diverse developments at commendable speed.But the track ahead is long and it is time to start discussing the reinvention of the institutional set-up.Indian Railways sees substantial private sector involvement in the form of vendors and contractors. Policymakers could start mulling extreme options such as parallel privately-owned and operated railway infrastructure, coupled with centralised planning and an evolved role for the railways. This will need a robust policy framework from the Government of India.The time is perhaps also ripe to bring user charge and asset monetisation-driven segments for passengers as well as cargo to the discussion table. Globally, the separation of infrastructure and operations in railways has delivered mixed results, for example in the United Kingdom. The model should be analysed and revisited to understand its potential relevance in the Indian context.The key would be to retrace our steps and align our long-term goals to identify not just incremental changes but also ways to explore bold and path-breaking alternatives that put Indian Railways on a smooth track and bring it up to speed.","Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore.

Budget 2024 capital gains tax changes: The Narendra Modi government is considering suggestions for tweaks in the new long term capital gains tax regime that was announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman in Union Budget 2024.The July 23 budget reduced the LTCG tax on property from 20% to 12.5%. The indexation benefit, which allowed taxpayers to adjust the acquisition cost for inflation before calculating capital gains and thus reduce their tax liability, is proposed to be eliminated for properties purchased on or after April 1, 2001.The government publishes the Cost Inflation Index (CII) annually for this calculation.India Inc is appealing to the government for a gradual shift to the long-term capital gains tax regime proposed in the FY25 budget, which aims to eliminate indexation benefits for property, gold, and other unlisted assets.According to an ET report by Deepshikha Sikarwar, the industry is suggesting alternatives such as a higher tax rate with indexation or a lower rate of 12.5% without indexation, as well as some form of grandfathering for ancestral properties.The finance ministry is currently reviewing these proposals and will discuss them with the Prime Minister's Office. The final decision will be made closer to the date when the Finance Bill reply is to be presented in Parliament, the reports said.Industry groups are expected to submit formal proposals to the finance ministry in the near future.

Budget 2024 for manufacturing sector : The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth. While the middle class has been offered tax relief, the government's primary focus remains on judicious spending to maximize economic impact. The budget's core themes are employment, skilling, MSME development, and support for the middle class.Largely focus has remained intact on spending money judiciously to ensure that each penny spent creates a ripple effect in the entire economic landscape.Although at first glance, manufacturing might appear to have taken a backseat, a deeper analysis reveals a multifaceted approach to bolstering the sector. Initiatives like employment-linked benefits and internship programs, while primarily aimed at job creation and skill development, indirectly benefit manufacturing companies by expanding the talent pool.Extensive focus on the MSME manufacturing units by way of extending term loan facility for purchase of machinery and equipment without collateral or third-party guarantee, would help companies in augmenting their capital base/ capacity and strengthen the very foundation of the manufacturing ecosystem in the country. Development of a new credit-assessment model by Public Sector Banks to assess MSME credit shall provide much needed regulatory relief to the units.With respect to the large manufacturing entities, while there is no direct fiscal/ tax incentive introduced in this budget, some support has been provided with an extensive focus on development of ‘industrial parks’ in nearly 100 cities under the ‘plug and play’ model. Reforms proposed with respect to land administration, planning and management, shall also ease out acquisition related difficulties often faced by entrepreneurs/ business houses in acquiring lands for manufacturing set-ups.Targeted Customs duty interventions like, rationalization of Customs duty provisions in Mobile phone manufacturing setups, extension of Customs duty exemption on import of capital goods for manufacturing of solar cells and panels, full Customs duty exemption on import of 25 critical minerals,, shall provide the required impetus for enhancing domestic manufacturing environment.Governments’ focus on formulating an Economic Policy Framework to set the scope for next-gen reforms in the country, has a target to improve the productivity of factors of production, namely, land, labour, capital, entrepreneurship and technology. This shall pave the way for enabling achievement of a target of 25% manufacturing sector contribution to the nation’s GDP over the course of next 7-10 years.While the overall outlook is positive, the extension of tax benefits under Section 115BAB for manufacturing entities and the absence of new PLI schemes are notable omissions.The country’s manufacturing base is expanding as is reflective from the continuously increasing tax collections and expanding Purchasing Manager’s Index. It would be pertinent to see how the ground realities evolve vis-à-vis the vision envisaged, in the upcoming Financial Year.","The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth.

Budget 2024: Armed with the vision to propel India to become a developed country by 2047, the Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business thereby providing the required stimulus to the manufacturing sector and enabling large scale job creation.On the Indirect tax front, the industry welcomes the much-needed announcement for a comprehensive review of the rate structure under Customs enabling ease in product classification and dispute reduction.The proposal of lowering of Customs duty on a plethora of raw materials and products including solar cells, critical minerals and bullion are encouraging measures. The rationale behind such reduction clearly indicates support towards domestic manufacturing, deepening value addition and supporting targets in reducing carbon footprint.Relevant amendments under the Customs law have been made to provide increased time limits for re-imports and re-exports to enhance competitiveness of the fledgling MRO sector. The government has extended significant duty reduction and exemption benefits to the healthcare and electronics sectors, continuing the impetus of incentives provided under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme.Since their introduction in March 2020, the PLI schemes have indeed supported in revitalizing the manufacturing sector and strengthening the necessary supply chains. The success achieved in the mobile manufacturing sector has now enabled the Government to reduce customs duties on mobile phones and components, signalling a mature environment. The Budget proposals aim at reproducing similar outcomes for semiconductor and pharmaceutical industry by increasing the budgetary allocation.Buoyed by the increasing revenue collection under GST signalling a shift towards a mature tax regime, this Budget has harmonized the timeframes for the issuance of demand notices and adjudication orders for cases involving fraud, suppression or otherwise. Significant amendments to the GST legislations have been introduced reflecting the recommendations proposed by the GST Council such as regularizing non-levy of GST due to general practice which may turn out to be a breather for certain impacted industries reeling under huge tax demands.The Insurance sector has been provided much relief through the GST council recommendations which have been cemented in the present budget thereby ending long standing disputes on their business practices.The Government's efforts to push forward with its reform agenda are evident as plans to incentivize states for their business reform actions plans and digitalization through the Jan Vishwas Bill 2.0 is proposed. Further, setting up of e-commerce export hubs is envisaged to facilitate easier access to international markets for domestic players.The recent implementation of Budget proposals allows the government to maintain momentum in its reform agenda. These policy measures implicitly reaffirm the significance of India Inc as a crucial element in the development of infrastructure. However, there are still some expectations required to be met to march towards a Viksit Bharat 2047.",The Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business.

Budget 2024 : Real estate, a significant contributor to employment generation, has received a fair bit of attention in Budget 2024-25. Recent years have seen the sector transform rapidly, driven by factors such as favourable government policies, Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, strong economic growth and changing consumer preferences.Added to that, the budgetary focus on job creation, skilling and employment-linked incentives, infrastructure, urban development, rural connectivity, digitalisation and land-related norms, all dovetail to promote growth of the sector.Launched in June 2015, the PMAY aims to provide affordable housing to all eligible beneficiaries. The budget unveiled PMAY Urban 2.0, under which the housing needs of 1 crore urban poor and middle class will be addressed with an investment of Rs 10 lakh crore.The central government’s additional Rs 2.2 lakh crore injection in the next 5 years to make housing more affordable has the potential to revitalise the affordable housing market.Such an approach can play an important role in realising the government's vision of Housing for All and push growth and development. Hence, the significant investment under PMAY Urban 2.0 is expected to alleviate urban housing deficits, spurring construction and economic growth.Steps to introduce technological reforms within the regulatory framework for land, such as digitalisation or GIS mapping of land records, will improve transparency.Rationalisation of stamp duty across states will also be critical to bring in uniformity and initiate land-related reforms such as urban planning, usage and building bylaws.These are steps in the right direction and will boost growth. Moreover, they will improve the ease of property transactions and strengthen municipal finances through increased property taxes. Rationalization of stamp duty with an emphasis on women homebuyers may boost home-buyer sentiment in major cities, too.The budget has also given ample attention to urban and rural development, with rental housing for industrial workers through the public private partnership model, interest subsidies for rental housing, and transit-oriented developments.The proposal to develop investment-ready plug-and-play industrial parks in 100 cities may attract industrial investment, leading to increased demand for industrial real estate and support the growth of ancillary services and residential developments in these regions.Initiatives for industrial parks and rental housing for industrial workers align with the country’s manufacturing goals and addresses worker accommodation needs.These steps are expected to promote industrial growth and stability in labour-intensive sectors, while also creating new opportunities for real estate developers specialising in rental and affordable housing.The changes in long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax, however, have evoked a mixed reaction. The government lowered the long-term capital gains tax from 20% to 12.5%, which is a welcome step. However, this came with the removal of the indexation benefit.The changes could encourage more liquidity in property transactions and potentially increase the effective tax burden depending on the property’s acquisition date.The launch of Phase IV of the PM Gram Sadak Yojana in 25,000 rural habitations will improve connectivity in rural areas, promoting rural development and making these regions more accessible for investment. The primary objective of PMGSY is to build robust, all-weather roads in rural habitations. This initiative focuses on enhancing connectivity and supporting economic development in rural areas.In essence, the budget is geared towards stimulating growth and investment in the real estate sector , fostering a more transparent and investor-friendly environment, and contributing to overall development. It aims to create a balanced and inclusive growth environment by addressing the needs of various segments, including affordable housing, industrial workers and urban infrastructure.The effectiveness of the initiatives, however, hinges on their implementation and continued support of complementary reforms.","The budget unveiled PMAY Urban 2.0, under which the housing needs of 1 crore urban poor and middle class will be addressed with an investment of Rs 10 lakh crore.

New Budget 2024 rule: Why Income Tax Department is likely to issue a huge number of tax notices this month,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-budget-2024-rule-why-income-tax-department-is-likely-to-issue-a-huge-number-of-tax-notices-this-month/articleshow/112186079.cms,"Taxing Times

Income Tax Notice on the way? The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month, as there are concerns that many taxpayers might escape the tax net due to the impending implementation of the new reassessment law on September 1, 2024.According to the amended regulation announced in Budget 2024 , the tax authorities can only go back a maximum of five years to reassess a taxpayer's records if the escaped income is at least Rs 50 lakh, and three years for an amount less than Rs 50 lakh.Previously, they could reassess cases up to 10 years old.According to an ET report, tax officials are now faced with the challenge of compiling and corroborating data on tax and income mismatches for the financial years 2013-14 to 2017-18 within the next few weeks, as these years will become time-barred for reassessment from September 1, 2024.The I-T department relies on information from various sources, such as banks, property registrars, and search findings from the investigation wing, to build reassessment cases.A tax officers' body has raised concerns about the feasibility of issuing notices under Section 148 (or 148A) in a large number of cases within a single month, given the overburdened nature of the jurisdictional assessing officers and the time-consuming process of obtaining sanction from the chief commissioner, who is the specified authority for such notices.Moreover, the law provides taxpayers with the right to explain their position before reassessment orders are finalized, a process that most believe cannot be completed by the end of August.Also Read | ITR refund status for FY 2023-24: How to check income tax refund status online - here’s a step-by-step guide for incometax.gov.in & NSDL websites The Central Board of Direct Taxes ( CBDT ) has been urged by its officers to postpone the effective date of the proposed amendment. However, this suggestion is unlikely to be well-received by corporations and high net worth individuals.""Capping the reassessment period at five years was a great decision as it would reduce hassles and litigation. But if the department fears there could be a genuine loss of revenue as it may not be possible to wrap up several matters by August 31, the government can think of strict parameters where time-bound cases can be selectively reopened - based on trails of steps taken in identifying escaped income,"" said Mitil Chokshi, partner at CA firm Chokshi & Chokshi.""Taxpayers may expect a rush of reassessment notices in August 2024. These notices are likely to be for the AYs 2018-19 and prior to that. It is pertinent to note that the Bombay High Court in a recent ruling in a case of Hexaware Technologies has taken a view on a proviso introduced in 2021, which can be interpreted to mean that AY 2017-18 (and prior years) got time barred on March 31, 2024. These reassessment notices (for AYs 2017-18 and prior) are likely to rake up new interpretation issues in the already muddled reassessment provisions,"" said Ashish Mehta, partner at law firm Khaitan & Co.The current situation is similar to the conflict between the Income Tax office and taxpayers in 2021. The reassessment law was amended in April 2021, allowing the tax office to reopen 10-year-old tax returns if the total undisclosed income exceeded Rs 50 lakh and reassess 4-year-old matters if the amount was less than Rs 50 lakh.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? However, this change led to over 10,000 writ petitions being filed by companies, arguing that they were not given sufficient time to explain and that the notices were issued without considering the carve-out that cases which couldn't be reopened earlier couldn't be reassessed under the new law.The Supreme Court invoked its extraordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution on May 4, 2022, to uphold all reassessment notices issued after March 31, 2021. However, the court left room for judicial proceedings based on the merits of each case, and several such matters are currently pending before the court.","The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month.

Latest NPS rules, news: In the Union Budget 2024 speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced two new initiatives with regard to National Pension Scheme (NPS) - extension of NPS 14% employer contribution benefits to private setcor and the intended launch of NPS Vatsalya.Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries, bringing it at par with the provisions available for government employees.Sriram Iyer, CEO, HDFC Pension Management told ET that with this move the “ground rules have been harmonised among government and non-government employees, which is a positive step.”Effectively, this means that now, private-sector employees can choose to reduce the taxable portion of employers’ contribution to their NPS corpus, thereby paying less tax and leaving greater funds in their pension deposits.“Employees will benefit from tax savings . More importantly, the 40% increase in contribution will have a significant impact on the terminal value of the retirement corpus,” remarked Iyer. The extended savings will “help in retirement planning, working as an option that is at par with the Provident Fund,” Dinesh Rohira, CEO & Founder, 5nance.com was quoted as saying.Moreover, the endeavour aims to increase NPS penetration by increasing tax incentives for the private sector, providing them a social security-cushion post-retirement.The scheme’s motive to widen the NPS subscriber base may not prove to be flawlessly effective, however. This is explained by Agrees Mrin Agarwal, Founder, Finsafe India: “While it’s good that the limit has been raised, it may not increase adoption as employees need to be educated in a big way. Also, the benefit is only for the salaried opting for the new tax regime,” she says.The mandatory contribution to the EPF, too, threatens to relegate the provisions of NPS under the umbrella of near-superfluity. This sentiment is echoed by Varun Sahay, a software engineer in a Delhi-based IT company: “When 12% of my salary is already deducted for the EPF, why should I put in more in the NPS and cut my take-home pay?”Rohira feels otherwise. “There’s no competition between the NPS and EPF as employees can contribute to both and build a 3-4 times bigger corpus while earning 3-4% higher returns via marketlinked options in the NPS,” he counters.Also Check | New Tax Regime 2023 vs 2024 After Budget: How Much Income Tax Will Salaried Taxpayers Save & How Do New Tax Slabs Compare To Old Regime? Top 10 Points You Must Know To jumpstart retirement savings for children, a new initiative called NPS Vatsalya has been unveiled in the Budget. This scheme allows parents and guardians to contribute to a minor's account, which can be converted into a regular NPS account once the child reaches adulthood.""It provides a very long duration for reaping the compounding benefits and accumulating a huge bounty at a later age. This can be a good way to plan a better future for kids who may not opt for a service segment in the future,"" says Rohira. Sriram Iyer agrees, stating, ""It’s a good move to help the child start his retirement journey. Even if a parent starts when the child is 10 years old, by the time he starts working, it can be a solid foundation for the compounding journey after that.""However, some experts question the utility of a product with such a long lock-in period, especially when parents cannot use the funds for essential goals like their child’s education amidst soaring education costs of 11-12%.""Parents are struggling to save for their own retirement, so it might be a bit of a stretch to expect them to save for their kids’ retirement. The need of the hour is a market-linked product that allows withdrawals only for the child’s education,"" says Mrin Agarwal, Founder of Finsafe India.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? Though the NPS permits partial withdrawals, it allows only 25% of the corpus after three years of joining, and this can be done only three times during the entire tenure. A premature exit before 60 years with 100% withdrawal is only possible if the corpus is less than Rs.2.5 lakh, an amount insufficient for most children's goals.""In its current form, there won’t be any uptake,"" asserts Agarwal. Rohira concurs, ""It’s a vanilla product with a lock-in, which does not make it very attractive and it may not take off. However, the government may optimise it and introduce new features later."" Iyer adds, ""This is just a start and there may be more subscriber-friendly features as we take it to the market. The regulator is proactive and open to feedback.""","Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries.

Gold import duty cut: Why Indians may not find buying gold from Dubai as attractive post Budget 2024,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-import-duty-cut-why-indians-may-not-find-buying-gold-from-dubai-as-attractive-post-budget-2024/articleshow/112097671.cms,"Gold import duty cut in Budget 2024: The recent reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai. Indian jewellers with stores in both India and the UAE believe that the narrowed duty differential will result in lower gold prices in India, making it less attractive for Indians to purchase gold in Dubai.The emirate had attracted gold-enthusiast Indians following a steep rise in customs duty in India in July 2022. In the fiscal 2024-25 budget, the duty on gold imports was more than halved.The duty cut is also expected to boost gold jewellery production in India, particularly the popular 'Kolkatti' jewellery from Kolkata, which is favored by Indian expats in Dubai and tourists from various countries. This move will encourage gold artisans to create new designs in both heavyweight and lightweight jewellery, attracting consumers to purchase gold from India.According to an ET report, Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group , estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India as Indian tourists who previously bought jewellery in Dubai will now prefer to shop in India. However, Indian expats living in Dubai and other customers may continue to buy from the UAE.Also Read | Gold losing sheen?

He points out that the labour cost is significantly lower in India, and with the introduction of mandatory hallmarking and HUID numbers, the purity of gold in India is no longer a concern.Furthermore, NRIs in Dubai do not receive VAT refunds, and Indians travelling abroad only receive about 60% of the VAT back on their gold purchases. Gold trade analyst Bhargav Baidya suggests that the 1% duty differential between gold jewellery in India and Dubai will be offset by Indian jewellers offering discounts to retain and attract customers.Saurabh Gadgil, chairman of PNG Jewellers, notes that Indian import duty is now on par with the US, allowing Indian jewellers to offer competitive prices compared to other countries worldwide. The reduced customs duty is expected to make gold purchases in India more attractive and convenient for Indian consumers, potentially leading to a significant shift in their gold shopping preferences.",The reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai.

Gold losing sheen? The government has reduced its target for issuing gold bonds in the financial year 2024-25 by 38% compared to the previous interim budget goal, according to a senior official. The revised target stands at Rs 18,500 crore, down from Rs 29,638 crore estimated in the interim budget and Rs 26,852 crore (revised estimate) in 2023-24.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told ET ""The decision followed a reassessment of various factors, including investor demand, other investment products and uncertainties around the global economy, as the situation has changed since the interim budget in February.""After accounting for redemptions, the net issuances of sovereign gold bonds are now estimated at Rs 15,000 crore for this fiscal year, a significant decrease from the Rs 26,138 crore projected in the interim budget and Rs 25,352 crore in the revised estimate for 2023-24.Harish Galipelli, director at ILA Commodities India, attributed this shift to retail investors increasingly opting for equities in anticipation of better returns. He also noted that people are uncertain about the potential for further increases in gold prices in the short-to-medium term following a recent rally. Additionally, Galipelli pointed out that savings in rural areas have been impacted by retail inflation and other factors.The gold bond and gold monetisation schemes were introduced by the government in late 2015 to discourage the physical purchase of precious metals and reduce imports, thereby mitigating the negative impact on the current account deficit.The gross collection through these two schemes is now projected to be Rs 20,030 crore in 2024-25, compared to Rs 31,168 crore in the interim budget and Rs 28,240 crore (revised estimate) in the previous fiscal year. Similarly, the net collection is estimated at Rs 16,433 crore, down from Rs 27,571 crore in the interim budget and Rs 26,653 crore in the previous year. However, the estimates for the gold monetisation scheme remain unchanged from the interim budget level.Also Read | Budget 2024: Duty cuts on gold, silver, platinum, and diamonds to make jewellery more affordable The sovereign gold bond scheme targets investors who view gold as an investment, encouraging them to purchase paper gold instead of physical gold.On the other hand, the gold monetisation scheme aims to bring out idle gold held by households, temple trusts, and others to increase domestic supply. Both schemes were designed to curb gold imports, which, along with crude oil, have been significant contributors to India's current account deficit.

Wall Street holds near records after Fed delivers a big cut to rates,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/wall-street-holds-near-records-after-fed-delivers-a-big-cut-to-rates/articleshow/113468971.cms,"NEW YORK: Wall Street is holding near its records on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve kicked off its efforts to prevent a recession with a bigger-than-usual cut to interest rates .The S&P 500 was virtually flat in late trading and 0.6% below its all-time high set in July. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 31 points, or 0.1%, and close to its record set on Monday.The Nasdaq composite was 0.2% higher, as of 3:35 p.m. Eastern time.The momentous move by the Fed helps financial markets in two big ways. It eases the brakes off the economy, which has been slowing under the weight of higher rates, and it gives a boost to prices for all kinds of investments. Besides stocks, gold and bond prices had already rallied in recent months on expectations that cuts to rates were coming.Because the move was so well telegraphed, and markets had already climbed so much in anticipation of it, Wall Street's reactions were relatively muted despite the Fed's historic action. It marked the first cut to the federal funds rate in over four years, and it closed the door on a stretch where the Fed kept the rate at a two-decade high to slow the economy enough to stifle the worst inflation in generations.Now that inflation has eased significantly from its peak two summers ago and appears to be heading toward 2%, the Fed says it it can turn more of its attention toward protecting the slowing job market and overall economy.""The time to support the labor market is when it's strong and not when you begin to see the layoffs,"" Fed Chair Jerome Powell said. ""That's the situation we're in.""The only question is how much the Fed will ultimately cut rates by to do so, which can prove to be a tricky balance. Lowering rates would help the economy by making it easier for US businesses and households to borrow. But it could also offer more fuel for inflation.The Fed released forecasts Wednesday that said its median official expects to cut the federal funds rate by another half of a percentage point through the end of the year. That could mean a traditional-sized cut of a quarter of a percentage point at each of its two remaining meetings scheduled for 2024.After that, the median Fed official is projecting another full percentage point of cuts during 2025.Some critics say the Federal Reserve may be moving too late to protect the economy after having kept rates too high for too long.""When the Fed is behind the curve, it sometimes takes a big move to catch up to where they should have been all along,"" said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management.""We don't think we're behind,"" Powell said in a press conference following the Fed's announcement. ""We think this is timely. But I think you can take this as a sign of our commitment not to get behind,"" pointing to Wednesday's hefty cut of half a percentage point. Powell called it a ""good strong start to this.""Other critics, meanwhile, are saying the Fed will need to be careful about cutting rates too much because of the possibility that inflation will remain stubbornly higher than it's been in recent decades.Powell repeated several times that the Fed does not feel ""a rush to get this done"" and will make its decisions on interest rates at each successive meeting, depending on what incoming data say.""We'll move as fast or as slow as we think is appropriate in real time,"" he said. For now, he said, ""the US economy is in a good place, and our decision today is designed to keep it there.""Treasury yields squiggled down and up immediately after the Fed announced its cut and published its projections.The 10-year Treasury yield eventually rose to 3.70% from 3.65% late Tuesday. The two-year yield, which more closely follows expectations for Fed action, edged up to 3.62% from 3.60% late Tuesday.On Wall Street, stocks of oil-and-gas producers and other companies whose profits are most closely tied to the strength of the economy helped lead the way. Utilities and other dividend-paying stocks that tend to hold up better during economic downturns, meanwhile, lagged behind the market.That could be a signal that Wall Street sees lower odds of painful recession following the Fed's cut, according to Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute.Intuitive Machines soared 40% after Nasa awarded it with a contract worth up to $4.82 billion for communication and navigation services the space agency will use to establish a long-term presence on the moon.Trading in Tupperware Brands remained halted after the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.

US Fed rate cut: Michelle Bowman's dissent is first from Fed Governor since 2005,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/michelle-bowmans-dissent-is-first-from-fed-governor-since-2005/articleshow/113468380.cms,"Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman made history on Wednesday by becoming the first Fed governor since 2005 to vote against an interest-rate decision, marking a rare moment of dissent within the US central bank. Bowman’s opposition denied Fed Chair Jerome Powell a unanimous decision at a critical juncture, as the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 50 basis points.Bowman favored a more modest quarter-point cut, while the other 11 voting members supported the half-point reduction. Out of the Fed's 19 policymakers, only 12 cast votes on rate decisions, including the seven members of the Fed Board and the president of the New York Fed. The remaining 11 Fed presidents rotate in voting every year.Dissents from Fed governors were more common prior to 1995, but since then, the majority of the 90-plus dissents have come from Fed presidents. Fed chairs, including Powell, typically seek consensus to maintain credibility, often reaching compromises to avoid open disagreement. However, dissents are not unheard of, particularly at key moments in monetary policy . During the pandemic, unanimous decisions were more frequent, but Powell acknowledged that differences of opinion are a normal part of the process.Bowman’s dissent was a notable one, as she has become one of the more hawkish voices at the Fed, consistently advocating for higher interest rates to fully combat inflation. Her call for a quarter-point cut reflected her concerns about easing too quickly. This marks the first hawkish dissent from a Fed governor in nearly 30 years.While financial markets largely expected a half-point cut ahead of the meeting, Bowman's dissent underscores the balancing act the Fed faces. Dissenters, such as Kansas City Fed President Esther George in 2022, have historically marked significant moments in Fed decision-making. As ING economist James Knightley noted, such disagreements suggest ""tough discussions"" are taking place within the central bank.Bowman has also diverged from the majority on regulatory matters, advocating for a lighter approach to bank regulation. Her dissent on Wednesday continues her pattern of pushing for a stricter stance on inflation, even as the majority of her colleagues support easing monetary policy.",Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman was the first governor to vote against an interest-rate decision since 2005.

The Fed delivered a half-of-a-percentage-point cut as part of the expected 100 basis-point reduction for the year.

The US Federal Reserve's latest economic projections, released on Wednesday following its Sept. 17-18 meeting, indicate that central bankers expect to reduce interest rates to a range of 4.25%-4.50% by the end of the year. This projection range is lower than what they had anticipated in June, as inflation moves closer to their 2% target and unemployment increases.

The Fed's current target range for its short-term borrowing benchmark stands at 4.75%-5.00%, and the projections suggest that policymakers anticipate quarter-point rate cuts at the remaining two meetings this year, scheduled for November and December.

Looking further ahead, the median Fed policymaker projects a policy rate of 3.4% by the end of 2025, implying an additional four quarter-of-a-percentage-point cuts in 2024.

The policy rate is expected to reach 2.9% by the end of both 2026 and 2027, indicating a return to what the median Fed policymaker now considers a neutral rate.

These projections represent a shift from the Fed's June projections, which had anticipated only one quarter-point reduction in all of 2024. The change in outlook comes as inflation has eased from unexpectedly strong readings earlier in the year, while the unemployment rate has risen to 4.2%, more than half a percentage point higher than when the Fed began its rate-hike campaign in March 2022.

The Fed's decision to cut rates was based on the progress made toward its inflation goal and the assessment that the risks to both its mandates are now ""roughly in balance."" However, the decision was not unanimous, with Fed Governor Michelle Bowman dissenting in favor of a smaller quarter-point cut.

It is important to note that the projections represent the views of individual policymakers rather than an agreed consensus. Two of the Fed's 19 policymakers felt that no further rate cuts were necessary this year, while seven believed that only one additional quarter-of-a-percentage point cut would be required. On the other hand, only one policymaker anticipated more rate cuts this year than the median view.

US Federal Reserve Meeting : The US Federal Reserve on Wednesday cut interest rates by 50 basis points. ""In light of the progress on inflation and the balance of risks, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/2 percentage point to 4-3/4 to 5 percent,"" the FOMC statement read.This is the first time in over four years that the US Federal Reserve has cut interest rates.Today’s rate cut starts a cycle to reverse the restrictive conditions that had been imposed to keep inflation in check."" In considering additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage‑backed securities. The Committee is strongly committed to supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to its 2 percent objective,"" the FOMC statement read.Since July 2023, when the central bank last raised interest rates by 25 basis points to a range of 5.25% to 5.50% to address inflation, borrowing costs have remained at their highest levels in over two decades. Recently, however, attention has shifted to a moderating labor market.The latest US economic data shows that job growth, while slowing from the high levels seen during the COVID-19 pandemic, remains in positive territory, according to a Reuters report. Retail sales and industrial production figures released on Tuesday exceeded expectations, and the Atlanta Fed's model, which estimates economic growth based on incoming data, indicates that the economy is currently expanding at a 3.0% annual rate in the third quarter, surpassing the central bank's estimates of the U.S. economy's potential.Following the pandemic, a perfect storm of factors, including goods scarcity, significant spending, labor shortages, large government deficits, and aggressive corporate pricing, pushed inflation to its highest level in 40 years in 2022.Although wage growth was robust and outpaced price increases for many workers, sentiment remained negative for much of the time. The Federal Reserve raised interest rates to slow the economy, which led to higher home mortgage rates and banks tightening credit for various loans and borrowers.The Fed's preferred inflation measure is now just half a percentage point above the central bank's target, and it is expected to gradually decrease throughout the remainder of 2024 and into the following year.Despite the challenges, the economy has performed better than anticipated by nearly all measures.This year, US stock markets have rallied, with all three major indexes reaching record highs due to expectations of lower interest rates as inflation eased and the job market displayed gradual signs of cooling.","US Federal Reserve on Wednesday cut interest rates by 50 basis points.

"US Fed to kick off rate cuts, signal next steps",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-federal-reserve-to-kick-off-rate-cuts-signal-next-steps/articleshow/113441724.cms,"‘Dots’ and Economic Forecasts

The Fed's June Dot Plot

FOMC Statement

“The Fed is all but sure to kick off the rate-cut cycle at its Sept. 17-18 meeting. Whether they start with a 25- or 50-basis-point cut remains a close call. In our view, forecast coherence and risk management point to 50 basis points as the right choice. The absence of a clear steer — so far — on the possibility of a jumbo move points toward the 25-basis-point option.” Anna Wong, chief US economist

The Federal Reserve is widely expected to lower interest rates this week after holding borrowing costs at a two-decade high for more than a year.By how much, however, remains an open question.Forecasters largely anticipate the Federal Open Market Committee will reduce rates by a quarter point to a range of 5% to 5.25%, though economists at JPMorgan Chase & Co.expect a bigger, half-point move. Investors see better-than-even odds of a half-point adjustment.Fresh quarterly projections released at the conclusion of the central bank’s two-day policy meeting will offer further insight into the path ahead for borrowing costs and the economy.Investors generally see a more aggressive path of reductions this year than the series of quarter-point cuts expected by economists. Financial markets have priced in more than a full percentage point of cuts before the year is out, implying at least one half-point cut.Fed Chair Jerome Powell will need to strike a balance in the press conference between his own views, those of the committee and the message sent by the so-called “dot plot” of individuals’ rate projections — something that could prove challenging if the narratives differ.The decision will be announced via a post-meeting statement at 2pm on Wednesday in Washington. Powell will hold a press conference 30 minutes later. Here’s what to look for:Each quarter the Fed publishes what’s known as the Summary of Economic Projections, a compilation of policymakers’ individual forecasts for the federal funds rate, unemployment, economic growth and inflation. This week’s SEP will include projections for 2024 through 2027.It will likely include a range of views for the path of interest rates this year. Several participants saw the case for lowering interest rates at the FOMC ’s July meeting amid a pickup in unemployment and easing inflation. Since then, the labor market has weakened further. On the other hand, consumer prices excluding food and energy unexpectedly firmed in August, strengthening the case for moving with caution.While the median dot may signal three quarter-point cuts this year, there are likely to be several officials who think the Fed should lower rates faster.“There are a number of people who think this cut should be 50 basis points, or there should be a 50-basis-point cut later this year,” said Derek Tang, economist at LH Meyer/Monetary Policy Analytics. “The economy is softening quicker than they expected.”The economic forecasts for this year will also be revised. The unemployment rate has already surpassed the Fed’s June projection of 4%, and the central bank’s preferred inflation metric — at 2.5% — has already fallen below the committee’s most recent median forecast.The FOMC doesn’t vote on the forecasts, but they do vote on the statement. The document provides a qualitative description of how the committee as a whole sees the near-term outlook relative to their mandate of stable prices and maximum employment.There are several possibilities for how the wording may change, including language around the balance of risks between employment and inflation.The July statement said those risks “continue to move into better balance,” a line MacroPolicy Perspectives’ Julia Coronado and Laura Rosner-Warburton say is now out of step with recent comments from both Powell and Fed Governor Christopher Waller. Coronado and Rosner-Warburton said the FOMC could instead adopt a line similar to what Waller said on Sept. 6: “The balance of risks has shifted toward the employment side of our dual mandate.”The committee may also choose to describe further weakening in the labor market as “unwelcome,” a Greenspan-era term Powell resurrected in a recent speech.Economists are divided on whether and how policymakers would signal future cuts in the statement. Some 44% of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News said officials will acknowledge the possibility of further adjustments in the document, while 31% said they’d more explicitly state their intent to pursue a string of rate cuts and provide guidance on the pace.Press ConferenceThe press conference will offer insight into not only the committee’s thinking but also Powell’s. Fed watchers judge that the chair is more uncomfortable with recent job market softening than the median committee voter.Powell has grown increasingly encouraged the Fed can tame inflation with little cost to the economy and jobs. A jump in unemployment now would have high political and economic costs, a situation any central bank chief would want to avoid.If officials do choose to lower rates by a quarter point, Powell has the latitude to signal he aims to guard against further deterioration in the job market.“The message will be: We want extra ammunition on the table, but we aren’t going to use it today,” said Ellen Meade, a former senior adviser on policy and communication at the Fed Board who is now a research professor at Duke University.New VoterThis Fed meeting will also be the first for Beth Hammack, the new Cleveland Fed president. The former Goldman Sachs Group Inc veteran started in August and will cast a vote for the remaining policy decisions this year.",The Federal Reserve is widely expected to lower interest rates this week after holding borrowing costs at a two-decade high for more than a year.

AR glasses are here: Snap launches spectacles at LA summit and its own OS to power it,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/ar-glasses-are-here-snap-launches-spectacles-at-la-summit-and-its-own-os-to-power-it/articleshow/113436631.cms,"Features

Simplified Snapchat

LOS ANGELES: In one of the biggest tech launches this year, American multimedia company Snap Inc introduced its new cutting-edge AR ( augmented reality ) spectacles together with its new OS, which powers these see-through glasses.The fifth generation Snap spectacles , which the company says weigh 226 gram, sit lightly on the eyes and behave like usual glasses till you power it up and it conjures a screen that lets you have fun or get creative with a range of lenses.With big tech seeing the virtues of AR glasses, which are different from the opaque and chunkier VR headsets, Snap is first off the blocks in this new class of wearables. Meta is believed to be poised to introduce its own AR glasses too.The Snap spectacles, which are a standalone device and can be operated by pinch gestures of your right hand and a virtual console that opens on your left palm, work by projecting an overlapping AR image on your view and so don’t cut you off from reality.For example, if you are sitting in your living room, you can play a game of virtual chess on your real table wearing the spectacles – lifting pieces with pinch gestures and making your moves on the virtual board – while sipping on a (real) cup of coffee. The table, the chess board and pieces and the cup of coffee – you see all three clearly.Snap described the spectacles as “the result of a decade of research and development to introduce hardware that breaks the bounds of screens and brings people together in the real world”.The spectacles can also be paired with a phone through Snap’s ‘Spectacles’ app, which lets one use the phone as a game controller and also mirror the phone screen. The ‘spectator mode’ feature allows group activity with the spectacles. For example, two players can play that game of chess if both are wearing the spectacles.The new AR glasses were launched by Snap co-founder Evan Spiegel at the Santa Monica-based company’s main annual event, Snap Partner Summit , at the Barker Hangar in Los Angeles.“Tech can be way better than it is today. We can’t be bound by screens forever. We need something more intuitive, more human,” Spiegel said.Snap also announced a partnership with OpenAI that will open up artificial intelligence models to lens developers using the new AR glasses. As Spiegel put it, “no tech event in 2024 is complete without an OpenAI partnership”. Like image-generating AI tools, its Easy Lens can do the same to instantly generate lenses.At the summit, the company also announced Lego Games launching ‘Bricktacular’ for the spectacles, a partnership with Niantic, and a Star Wars Galaxy experience being crafted by ILM Immersive, Lucasfilm’s interactive studi0.The spectacles, the company said, will be available for now only to lens developers, including those from India, working with Snap for a $99 monthly subscription.The Snap AR glasses are equipped with four cameras that power Snap Spatial Engine and enable hand tracking. The Optical Engine has been designed to enable a see-through AR display.The glasses work through liquid crystal on silicon (LCoS) micro-projectors that create vivid images and have waveguides that make it possible to see the images created by the LCoS projector without the need for calibrations or custom fittings. They have a 13 millisecond motion-to-photon latency that give, the company said, “incredible accuracy, integrating them naturally into your environment”.The Optical Engine delivers a 46-degree diagonal field of view with a 37 pixel per degree resolution – similar to a 100-inch display which is 10 feet away. The glasses tint automatically based on surrounding light and work indoor and outdoor.The dual system-on-a-chip architecture with two Snapdragon processors splits the compute workload on the spectacles while titanium vapour chambers dissipate heat. The company announced a runtime on a single charge of up to 45 minutes.“We want to be the most developer-friendly platform in the world and empower developers to invest in building amazing lenses,” the company said in a statement, while announcing that the spectacles would have no developer tax and would give developers new ways to build and share lenses. “Instead of a complicated compiling process, the newly rebuilt Lens Studio 5.0 lets developers quickly push their project to spectacles,” it said.Snap also announced at the summit it is testing “a new and simplified Snapchat that organises the app around communicating with friends, using the camera, and watching snaps from friends and the broader Snapchat community, including creators and publishers”.“We’ve been working on unifying Stories and Spotlight for some time. Now, with this new and simplified design, Snapchatters will have a more personal and relevant viewing experience,” it said.","Snap Inc introduced its new cutting-edge AR ( augmented reality ) spectacles together with its new OS, which powers these see-through glasses.

""The completion of the reforms will be critically important for Bangladesh and its young people,"" he said.During the meeting, Yunus urged the World Bank to provide the necessary flexibility and support for the country's reform initiatives.""We need a big push, and we have to focus on the dreams of the students.""In a televised address last week, Yunus said the government was appealing for $5 billion in aid to help stabilise an economy that has been struggling since the Ukraine war sharply increased the cost of fuel and food imports.

Shares have lost roughly 40% in value so far this year.Northcoast Research estimates the total impact of the strike could reach $3 billion or more. ""Boeing will most likely remove 33-35 jets from the original production plan, resulting in a loss of $102 million in daily revenue,"" said Chris Olin, an analyst at North coast Research.New CEO Kelly Ortberg is now confronting a labor-management battle just weeks after he was brought in to restore faith in the planemaker, which is also facing heavy scrutiny from US regulators for its safety practices.Last week all three major ratings agencies warned that a prolonged strike could cost the company its investment-grade rating. That would increase borrowing costs for Boeing, which already has a $60-billion debt pile.""We estimate the strike will pare sales by more than 2008's nearly $100 million per day since current volumes are higher,"" TD Cowen analyst Cai von Rumohr said.Boeing's finances are already under pressure due to negative free cash flow and poor margins. The planemaker needs to generate sufficient cash flow to meet payments on its debt.On Monday, Boeing said it was freezing hiring and weighing temporary furloughs to keep costs in check.Each revenue slip of more than $100 million per day will pare $60 million in cash, since the planemaker receives 60% of a plane's price upon delivery, TD's von Rumohr said.Jefferies analysts say the strike would amount to a hit of about $1.3 billion in monthly free cash flow.","Boeing could lose over $100 million in daily revenue until it reaches a settlement with its union.

'Our business is in a difficult period': Boeing considers layoffs amid workers' strike,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/our-business-is-in-a-difficult-period-boeing-considers-layoffs-amid-workers-strike/articleshow/113409042.cms,"In response to the ongoing factory workers' strike that began last week, Boeing has announced a series of measures ""to preserve cash and safeguard future"".Chief financial officer (CFO) Brian West outlined 10 immediate cost-cutting initiatives in a memo to employees, including a company-wide hiring freeze, a pause on pay increases for promoted managers and executives, and a halt to all non-essential travel.West said the moves were necessary because “our business is in a difficult period.”West also mentioned the possibility of temporary layoffs. ""We are also considering the difficult step of temporary furloughs for many employees, managers and executives in the coming weeks,"" West said, adding, ""this strike jeopardizes our recovery in a significant way.""The company plans to reduce spending on suppliers and stop most supplier purchase orders related to the 737, 767, and 777 airplane models.The strike, which began early Friday, involves approximately 33,000 workers represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. The walkout occurred after workers rejected a proposed 25 per cent pay increase over four years, with the union initially seeking a pay hike of at least 40 per cent.Striking workers are picketing at various locations in Washington state, Oregon, and California in the US.The bonuses, which workers say range from $3,000 to $5,000 a year, have become a point of contention. Boeing argues that it is difficult to calculate bonuses fairly for 33,000 employees with different roles and instead proposes replacing the payouts with automatic contributions of $4,160 per year to each employee's 401(k) retirement account. Workers are also frustrated that over the past 16 years, Boeing has ended its traditional pension plan and reduced health care benefits through contract extensions.Boeing has faced significant financial challenges, losing more than $25 billion since the start of 2019 and burning through $4.3 billion in the second quarter of 2024 alone. The strike is expected to delay deliveries of new planes, which are a crucial source of cash for the company.Despite Stephanie Pope, the head of Boeing's commercial-airplanes division, urging workers to accept the contract offer last week, workers rejected the recommendation of their own leaders for the first time since 1995.Additional cost-cutting measures outlined in the CFO's memo include eliminating first- and business-class service for critical travel and halting spending on outside consultants.","Boeing has announced a series of measures ""to preserve cash and safeguard future"" The company plans to reduce spending on suppliers and stop most supplier purchase orders related to the 737, 767, and 777 airplane models.
