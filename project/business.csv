"Income Tax Expectations Budget 2024: What can the salaried, individual taxpayers expect? Top points",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/income-tax-expectations-budget-2024-what-can-the-salaried-individual-taxpayers-expect-top-points/articleshow/111827692.cms,"By Surabhi Marwah

Increase in the basic exemption limit under the new tax regime – One key change expected from the upcoming budget is the increase in the basic exemption limit from Rs 3,00,000 to Rs 5,00,000.

Reduction in tax rates under new tax regime – It is expected to have reduced tax rates / rejig in tax slabs under the new tax regime.

Increase in standard deduction – It is expected that the standard deduction is increased from Rs 50,000 to Rs 1,00,000 as this limit has remained the same for the last 5 years.

Increase in deduction for interest on housing loan for self-occupied house property – It is expected that the limit for deduction towards interest on housing loan for self-occupied house property will be increased from Rs 2,00,000 to Rs 3,00,000. This may also help promote home ownership and help the government in its mission of ‘Housing for All’.

Overhaul of the capital gains tax structure – Currently there are various tax rates and holding periods for different types of instruments and also the indexation benefit differs in different situations for the purpose of computation of capital gains tax. It is expected that the government may bring about some amendments such as changes in tax rates, method of computation, period of holding etc. to have a more unified and simplified capital gains tax regime. One specific wish from a capital gains taxation standpoint would be the increase in the tax-free ceiling limit on long-term capital gains from sale of equity shares (listed) / equity oriented mutual funds from Rs 1,00,000 to Rs 2,00,000.

Budget 2024 income tax expectations : The government is set to table its first full budget after elections and the wish list of taxpayers is as long as ever. This is especially so as the government did not make any key changes in the interim budget as it was a Vote on Account budget. Over the years, the government has been taking steps to make the concessional tax regime or the new tax regime more attractive for individual taxpayers.Few changes which were introduced in the last year’s budget i.e., Budget 2023 were:a) Increase in the basic exemption limit to Rs 3,00,000 from Rs 2,50,000b) Capping of maximum surcharge at 25%c) Introduction of standard deduction of Rs 50,000d) Rejig of the tax slabs.Keeping in view the government’s intent to simplify/ rationalise tax laws and enhance compliance, one may expect a few changes in the upcoming Union Budget 2024 to make the new income tax regime more attractive.Also Read | Budget 2024 income tax expectations: Why 50% HRA exemption should include cities like Bengaluru, Hyderabad At present, for individuals with gross income above Rs 15,50,000, if their total deductions and exemptions exceed Rs 3,75,000* (excluding standard deduction), the old regime is more beneficial as compared to the new one.Further, the increased cost of housing and increased awareness towards various investment instruments has led to higher claim of HRA exemptions and higher investment-based deductions (eligible under sections 80C, 80D of the Income-tax Act, interest on housing loan for self-occupied house property etc.) among salaried taxpayers and in many cases such limit of Rs 3,75,000 is easily breached resulting in taxpayers opting for existing / old tax regime.Therefore, in order to make the new tax regime more attractive and to keep up with the government’s intent of having a unified tax regime with fewer deductions / exemptions, one may expect few changes in the new regime as below:*This limit is for deductions and exemptions not available under the new tax regimeAlso Read | Income Tax expectations Budget 2024: Tax exempt limit for savings account interest to be raised to Rs 25,000?

The company's results followed positive performances from its larger competitors, Tata Consultancy Services and HCLTech, raising optimism for the $254 billion sector, which has been grappling with slow demand following a post-pandemic surge.In recent quarters, IT clients have reduced their spending on non-essential projects due to economic uncertainty and higher interest rates. However, analysts anticipate a change in this trend once the US Federal Reserve lowers interest rates and the outcome of the country's election is determined.","Infosys announced its financial results for the first quarter of the fiscal year 2024-25 on Thursday.

Banks offer special FD rates to attract deposits: In an effort to attract retail deposits, banks have launched special schemes offering savers an additional 25-30 basis points for term deposits above current commitments for similar tenures. This move suggests that policy interest rates are likely to remain high in the near future.According to an ET report, several major banks, including SBI , Bank of Baroda , Indian Overseas Bank , Union Bank of India , and Bank of Maharashtra, have introduced deposit plans with interest rates ranging from 7.25% to 7.30% for investments spanning 399 to 444 days.Senior citizens are eligible for an extra 50 basis points on these rates.For example, SBI's Amrit Vrishti scheme provides an interest rate of 7.25% for deposits with a tenure of 444 days. Similarly, Bank of Baroda's Monsoon Dhamaka plan offers the same rate of 7.25% for deposits spanning 399 days.Indian Overseas Bank has set its interest rate at 7.30% for deposits lasting 444 days. Bank of Maharashtra, on the other hand, is offering 6.90% for deposits with a duration of 200 days and 7.10% for those extending to 400 days.Lenders are struggling to raise retail deposits and have therefore introduced limited-period schemes, according to a treasury head from a commercial bank. Bankers believe that if credit growth continues at 14-16%, they will need to offer more attractive interest rates to mobilize deposits.Also Read | ITR filing FY 2023-24: What is the penalty for late filing of income tax return? Check penalties for misreporting tax & other mistakes The decision to increase deposit rates follows a recent interaction between the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and bank CEOs, where the regulator instructed banks to close the gap between deposit and credit growth. As of June 28, bank credit had risen by 14% year-on-year, while deposits had only increased by 11%.Industry experts believe that banks are offering these peak rates on shorter tenures because they anticipate the rate cycle, which was previously expected to shift in the latter half of this calendar year, will eventually start to reverse as inflation remains consistently within the central bank's legally mandated limits.Anil Gupta, senior vice president of the financial sector at ICRA Ratings, said, ""Banks are offering higher rates for less than two years tenure. So when the interest rate cycle turns, banks would not want to be stuck with high-cost liabilities.""However, RBI governor Shaktikanta Das recently indicated that rates would remain elevated for some time, saying, ""The overall economic environment globally and in India is so uncertain... I think it is too early to talk about an interest rate cut.""",Banks have launched special schemes offering savers an additional 25-30 basis points for term deposits.

IDBI Bank: IDBI Bank Disinvestment: Govt's Next Move After RBI's 'Fit & Proper' Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/idbi-bank-disinvestment-govts-next-move-after-rbis-fit-proper-report/articleshow/111819164.cms,"NEW DELHI: With RBI giving its “fit and proper” report on bidders for IDBI Bank , all eyes are now on govt and the Budget as the market awaits for a signal on disinvestment .IDBI Bank has been up for privatisation for several years, and govt had been awaiting an RBI’s assessment on bidders meeting the “fit and proper” norms — or are compliant with regulations and are not under the scanner of other regulators — to move to the next stage of the process.RBI has given its report on all but one bidder, a foreign player, which did not share information and the overseas regulator too has not provided data. Govt holds 45.5% in the erstwhile development financial institution that became a bank, with LIC being the largest shareholder with over 49% stake.The plan envisages the sale of 60.7% in the bank, including govt’s 30.5% and LIC’s 30.2%. Based on the current market cap of almost Rs 95,000 crore, the Centre can hope to realise almost Rs 29,000 crore from the disinvestment, although several observers have said that the terms of the transaction are not very attractive.While the Modi govt had lined up an ambitious privatisation agenda, including public sector companies such as BPCL, Concor, BEML, Shipping Corporation, IDBI Bank, state-run lenders and an insurance company, it has failed to report any progress with a virtual freeze on the exercise for the last 18 months as the general elections were due.While there were expectations that things will move post-polls, but the verdict has put a question mark over the fate of disinvestment, especially with petroleum minister Hardeep Puri recently stating that BPCL privatisation has been shelved.Modi govt stance on privatisation is eagerly awaited, given that this time it is dependent on coalition partners and the Budget is likely to provide cues.Given the recent rise in PSU stocks, the govt can hope to meet its disinvestment target of Rs 50,000 crore during the current financial year.While the govt has repeatedly spoken about getting out of sectors that are “non-strategic”, in the last 10 years, it only has the Air India disinvestment to count as a success.Market observers see IDBI Bank as an easier entity to divest, given that it is a private lender for all practical purposes with govt stake rising due to massive capital infusion to help the bank deal with bad debt-driven losses.","RBI has given its report on all but one bidder, a foreign player, which did not share information.

Covid-year job surge led by agriculture, construction: RBI

Discover how RBI's analysis highlights a rise in employment in sectors like agriculture, construction, and health during the pandemic year. Despite economic setbacks, the report showcases growth in job opportunities across multiple industries.

MUMBAI: RBI , in its State of the Economy report, stated that the positive outlook for agriculture and the resurgence of rural spending are contributing to the growth momentum observed in Q2.The monthly report said that global economic activity is strengthening across advanced as well as emerging market economies, and that global trade in goods & services is gathering momentum.“The second quarter of 2024-25 has begun with signs of quickening momentum in the economy. The improvement in the outlook for agriculture and the revival of rural spending have turned out to be the bright spots in the evolution of demand conditions,” the report said.Noting that disinflation has been grudging and headline inflation remains closer to 5% than to the 4% target in its latest readings, the report raises concerns over food prices. “The argument that food price shocks are transitory does not seem to be borne out by the actual experience over the past one year — too long a period for a shock to be termed as transitory,” the report said.However, the authors, which include RBI deputy governor Michael Patra, do not rule out a change in policy stance before the 4% target is achieved. “Based on a careful evaluation of the balance of risks, an enduring movement towards the target should provide signals to forward-looking monetary policy to respond,” the report said.On the external front, the report notes that rupee has been the most stable among major currencies during the month. NRI deposits recorded net inflows of $2.7 billion in April-May 2024 as compared to $0.6 billion a year ago.Meanwhile, another report by RBI staff published in the July Bulletin said that as of the end of March 2023, household financial assets accounted for 135% of GDP while their financial liabilities were at 37.8% of GDP. This left their net financial wealth at 97.2% of GDP.","IMF raises India's GDP forecast to 7% for 2024-25. RansomHub emerges as the leading ransomware group, while FakeUpdates spreads globally.

'Won't back out from building Kedarnath temple replica': Delhi trust founder Rautela

Learn about the ongoing controversy surrounding the construction of a replica Kedarnath temple in Delhi by Shri Kedarnath Dham Delhi Trust. Legal threats from BKTC and Uttarakhand priests have arisen, leading to a police complaint. Stay updated on this development.

NEW DELHI: Following a diktat from the ministry of corporate affairs ( MCA ), IL&FS has sought to recover Rs 250 crore from beneficiaries of its employee welfare trust, in what may be a first instance of its kind in the country.The move by the ministry followed a report by the Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO), which concluded that the entity was allegedly used to park excess funds or profits and was subsequently used to facilitate payoffs and provide incentives to select employees.Some of the alleged “unjust payments” during 2006-07 to a select group of employees by the erstwhile management led by Ravi Parthasarthy, using the trust route, have been shared by SFIO with MCA, officials told TOI.Based on the report, MCA has identified around 200 beneficiaries of the IL&FS Employee Welfare Trust (IEWT) and asked the new IL&FS board, handpicked by govt, to seek a refund .The alleged beneficiaries of the “unjust payments” have been given 90 days to refund the money. The top 20 beneficiaries account for nearly 50% of the refund demand, officials said.IL&FS confirmed the development. “Basis directions from the MCA, the new IL&FS board has approved seeking refund of amounts paid to IEWT members, that have been tagged ‘unjust’ by SFIO in their report. Necessary communication has been issued to these members requesting refund of the amounts to IEWT,” a spokesperson for IL&FS Group said in response to a questionnaire from TOI.Getting a refund, however, may not be easy as some of the beneficiaries are dead, while the others have used the money for other purposes such as purchasing a house.The trust was set up in the 1990s by the erstwhile management to create a corpus that was to be used to extend benefits to select employees under its subsidiaries that were part of the trust.With the refunds sought from trust beneficiaries, the new IL&FS board has now sought refund of Rs 400 crore, including Rs 150 crore from erstwhile directors on the boards of IL&FS Financial, IL&FS, IL&FS Transportation Network after the accounts of these companies were recast and they reported losses from FY2013 to FY2018 instead of profits as estimated by the ousted boards of these companies.Former directors have been asked to refund money.","IL&FS has sought to recover Rs 250 crore from beneficiaries of its employee welfare trust.

Budget 2024 expectations: Power sector decarbonisation hinges on renewables,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2024-expectations-power-sector-decarbonisation-hinges-on-renewables/articleshow/111833113.cms,"By Sehul Bhatt

Budget 2024 expectations: For India to achieve its net-zero goal , the power sector will have to play a pivotal role as it is a significant contributor to emissions. According to The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) estimates, power generation accounted for ~45% of the country’s annual CO2 emissions , largely because coal-based generation continued to comprise 74% of overall power generation as of fiscal 2024.That is the reason the government’s agenda has been driven by power decarbonisation and renewable energy integration for some time now.As part of its UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow (COP 26) Nationally Determined Contribution goals, India has committed to a five-pronged plan called Panchamrit, which includes a commitment to increase the share of power generation from clean fuels to 50% by 2030.Also Check | Budget 2024 Expectations Live Updates: Income tax relief for salaried taxpayers, railways capex in focus The main challenge is these Panchamrit goals need to be implemented against a backdrop of soaring power demand, which clocked a compound annual growth rate of 8.4% between fiscals 2021 and 2024. Instant surges in power requirement are also on the rise, as indicated by peak demand hitting an all-time high of 250 GW in fiscal 2025 (April – May) compared with ~184 GW in 2020.As of fiscal 2024, solar and wind technologies (the main clean fuel sources in India) accounted for 11% of total generation. Add hydropower capacity and the share would rise to 19%.Covering the gap between 19% renewable power generation and the 50% target is a tall order as efficiency levels of power generation through coal could be ~70%, while that of solar and wind are only 25-35% as on date.To wit, solar and wind capacity will have to increase by 3x to match the power generation of a single coal plant, leading to high land and transmission requirements. Hydropower has its own set of challenges such as long gestation timelines, a large social and environmental impact and usage of shared water resources.Also Read | Budget 2024: Top 4 things FM Nirmala Sitharaman should do for agriculture That said, the Indian government has propelled growth in the renewable energy sector through agile policy making and critical routine interventions. For instance, the Production Linked Incentive scheme aims to foster the battery ecosystem and production of high-efficiency modules.The Viability Gap Funding scheme aims to support critical segments such as power storage and new areas such as offshore wind. The Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme, on its part, targets to improve the operational efficiency and financial sustainability of power distribution companies.Further, regulators are constantly updating bidding guidelines to resolve sectoral issues and providing extensions to key projects to sustain the sector’s momentum.Against this backdrop, CRISIL MI&A expects the power installed base to surge from ~442 GW as of fiscal 2024 to 715-720 GW by fiscal 2029. Solar, wind, storage and hydro will cumulatively account for ~60% of the total installed base, indicating a 2.7-fold increase in installed capacity compared with the combined base of 156 GW as of fiscal 2024 and a rise in the share renewables, including hydro and storage, to 35-40% of total generation by fiscal 2029.Also Read | Budget 2024 income tax expectations: Are you paying excess tax? You may be paying Rs 43,226 extra on Rs 10 lakh income - find out why Given escalating demand and the intermittent nature of power supply from clean energy sources such as solar and wind, regulators are planning to supplement renewable power generation with storage support. CRISIL expects 35-37 GW of storage support to be available by fiscal 2029 to maintain a stable power system, mainly through battery and pumped storage plant technologies.Cumulatively, this implies an investment of Rs 10-10.5 trillion on renewables (solar and wind), out of a total investment of Rs 17-17.5 trillion in the generation segment over fiscal 2025-2029, as other fuels continue to witness moderate additions considering demand dynamics.The clean energy push will impact not only generation but also transmission and distribution segments, as grid augmentation and grid stability support mechanisms have to be in place to ensure power systems are able to absorb such high levels of renewable capacity addition. These segments have to regularly upgrade and expand their capacity to cater to rising power needs. Consequently, investments of Rs 6.5-7 trillion are expected to be made on grid augmentation and grid stability support over fiscals 2025-2029.In the milieu, the Budget can look at providing support to specific segments.Also Read | Budget 2024 income tax expectations: Top 5 things FM Sitharaman should do for taxpayers - from tax slab changes to hiking standard deduction Within the clean energy spectrum, hydro is an important alternative being looked at, especially with multiple announcements on pumped storage projects. Government support is crucial to mitigate challenges in execution of hydro projects as it could pare high capital costs and pique the private sector’s interest.On the power distribution front, implementation of the Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme could be enhanced by providing further financing support to utilities.Also Read | Budget 2024 needs to offer policies and incentives to rev up auto industry growth To provide interim relief to solar developers while domestic supply chains are stabilising, trade policy related nuances require a close look – especially for solar photovoltaics – in view of a significant shift in procurement dynamics in the recent past.Overall, policy push has been a key factor in the power segment’s clean energy transition. Spurred by renewables, this transformation is set to pick up pace over the rest of the decade. Continued investor interest and private sector participation, too, are critical levers to enhance this transition.","For India to achieve its net-zero goal, the power sector will have to play a pivotal role.

The budget will be unveiled on July 23.If Modi’s administration maps out more deficit reduction, “it might lead to a further rally in bonds,” said Vikas Jain, Bank of America Corp.’s India head of fixed income, currencies and commodities. “This government has always delivered on its fiscal prudence” and investors believe it’ll stick to that course, he said.Also Check | Budget 2024 Expectations Live Updates: Income tax relief for salaried taxpayers, railways capex in focus Government spending plans have attracted scrutiny across emerging markets of late.

Colombia’s credit outlook was cut due to pressure on government accounts, while just this week Brazil’s president triggered a slide in its currency after raising doubts about fiscal targets.While Modi may raise some spending in the budget to address jobs creation and to alleviate rural distress, no one is expecting a blowout. A revenue windfall and a central government windfall is helping the government allot money to projects to mollify their new allies without increasing the deficit.Investors cheered the outgoing government’s prudent interim budget in February, when it outlined the 14.1 trillion-rupee borrowing target, sending the 10-year yield to a seven-month low. But news of Modi’s party losing its parliamentary majority, which raised the prospect of populist policies, triggered a spike in yields in June.

"Budget 2024 income tax expectations: Are you paying excess tax? You may be paying Rs 43,226 extra on Rs 10 lakh income",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2024-income-tax-expectations-are-you-paying-excess-tax-you-may-be-paying-rs-43226-extra-on-rs-10-lakh-income-find-out-why/articleshow/111800608.cms,"Income Tax Expectations Budget 2024: Are you paying excess tax?

Let's examine the tax liability for a taxable income of Rs 10 lakh.

The old regime results in a tax liability of Rs 1.17 lakh, which translates to an effective tax rate of 11.7%. In contrast, under the new tax regime, the tax liability stands at Rs 62,400, or 6.24%, says Bankbazaar.

Adjusting the 2013-14 tax (Rs 1.33 lakh) for inflation, the tax should have been reduced to Rs 73,774, or 7.3%.

Taking inflation into account, Rs 10 lakh in 2013 is equivalent to Rs 5.5 lakh in 2024. Consequently, the 'real' tax rate under the old regime is 21%, while it is 11.3% under the new regime.

Income Tax Expectations Budget 2024: Budget 2024 should look to change tax slabs under the old tax regime and also consider changes to the new tax regime to inflation-adjust the tax burden borne by salaried taxpayers , says Bankbazaar.com in its Pre-Budget 2024 primer.The old tax regime income tax slab rates, which have remained unchanged since 2013, have not been adjusted for inflation, resulting in taxpayers paying higher tax rates despite the rising cost of living, says Bankbazaar.Considering 2012-13 as the reference point, the value of every Rs 1 earned has effectively decreased to Rs 0.55 in 2024-25. Consequently, an income of Rs 10 lakh in 2012-13 now has the purchasing power of only Rs 5.50 lakh, while Rs 20 lakh is now equivalent to Rs 11 lakh in terms of buying capacity, it notes.Also Check | Budget 2024 Expectations Live Updates: Income tax relief for salaried taxpayers, railways capex in focus To put it simply, an income of Rs 10 lakh in 2012-13 would need to be Rs 18.15 lakh today, and an income of Rs 20 lakh would need to be Rs 36.30 lakh to have the same buying power.Bankbazaar’s analysis says that when inflation-adjustment is not taken into account for income tax brackets, and considering the 2012-13 inflation figures as the starting point, it leads to the inference that taxpayers are shelling out more than what they should.Under the old tax regime, earnings exceeding Rs 5 lakh are being subjected to excess taxes. In the new tax regime, this threshold is set at Rs 15 lakh, it says.For instance, on an income of Rs 10 lakh, excess taxes paid in the old regime are Rs 43,226, or Rs 3602 per month. At Rs 20 lakh, excess taxes paid are Rs 1.84 lakh in the old regime and Rs 67,978 in the new regime.Also Read | Budget 2024 income tax expectations: Top 5 things FM Sitharaman should do for taxpayers - from tax slab changes to hiking standard deduction The new regime appears to be more favorable in terms of inflation adjustment. However, upon closer examination, it becomes evident that the positive impact of the new tax regime is limited to incomes up to Rs 15 lakh. Within this income range, the effective tax rates seem to be lower compared to the inflation-adjusted values from 2013-14.For incomes exceeding Rs 15 lakh, the new regime does not provide any inflation adjustment. In comparison, the old regime fails to offer inflation adjustment for any income above Rs 5 lakh, it says.","Income Tax Expectations Budget 2024: Budget 2024 should look to change tax slabs under the old tax regime, says Bankbazaar.

Sitharaman's sixth Budget Presentation

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman , along with minister of State Pankaj Chaudhary and secretaries, attended the 'halwa' ceremony marking the final stage in preparing the full Budget for the fiscal year 2024-25, at North Block in Delhi on Tuesday.The ceremony was also attended by officers and staff who are involved in the budget preparation and compilation process.During Halwa ceremony, a large 'kadhai' is used to prepare the Indian sweet dish, Halwa, at the North Block and as part of the ceremony, the Finance Minister ritualistically stirs the 'kadhai' and serves the halwa to everyone involved in the Budget-making process.This tradition serves as a recognition of the hard work put in by all the finance ministry officials. The halwa ceremony also marks the beginning of the process of printing all thebudget documents in preparation for the presentation in Parliament.Every year, before the ""lock-in"" process of budget preparation begins, a traditional halwa ceremony is held.The halwa ceremony holds great significance as it signals the commencement of the lockdown at the finance ministry. During this period, no official is permitted to exit the ministry premises.The entire Budget team can only depart after the financial document has been presented in Parliament. Since 1980, the Union Budget has been consistently printed in the basement situated at the North Block.With the upcoming Budget Presentation, Sitharaman will surpass the record set by former Prime Minister Morarji Desai, who presented five annual budgets and one interim budget between 1959 and 1964 as finance minister. Sitharaman's forthcoming Budget speech will be her sixth.Similar to the recent full Union Budgets, the Budget 2024 will also be delivered in a paperless format. On February 1, an Interim Union Budget 2024 was presented, as the nation was preparing for general elections.The ""Union Budget Mobile App"" will provide easy access to all Union Budget documents, as mandated by the Constitution, including the Annual Financial Statement (popularly known as Budget), Demand for Grants (DG), and Finance Bill, among others. This app will ensure that the public can access these documents without any hassle.Parliament's budget session is set to commence on July 22 and is scheduled to conclude on August 12.","Nirmala Sitharaman attended the 'halwa' ceremony marking the final stage in preparing the full Budget for the fiscal year 2024-25, at North Block in Delhi on Tuesday.

Budget 2024: Why Modi government is likely to maintain disinvestment and dividend targets of close to Rs 1 lakh crore,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2024-why-modi-government-is-likely-to-maintain-disinvestment-and-dividend-targets-of-close-to-rs-1-lakh-crore/articleshow/111780424.cms,"Outlook for FY25

Analysts' Perspective

Budget 2024 expectations : The Modi government is likely to maintain its revenue collection targets of nearly Rs 1 lakh crore for the fiscal year 2024-25 (FY25) through disinvestment , asset monetization, and dividends from non-financial Central Public Sector Enterprises ( CPSEs ), according to senior officials.The interim budget presented in February combined disinvestment and asset monetisation under the 'miscellaneous capital receipts' category, instead of listing them separately, according to an ET report.This change pegged the combined realisation for the current fiscal at Rs 50,000 crore, up from the revised estimate of Rs 30,000 crore for FY24.Additionally, another Rs 48,000 crore was expected from dividends from non-financial CPSEs and entities where the government holds minority stakes. The actual dividend collections have surpassed initial estimates for the third consecutive year, reaching a new high of Rs 63,749 crore in FY24, approximately 27.5% higher than the revised estimate of Rs 50,000 crore.This remarkable performance, as noted by the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM), reflects the robust health of state-run firms across various sectors. Disinvestment and asset monetization also showed strong results, with proceeds totaling Rs 16,507 crore and Rs 16,000 crore respectively, beating the combined revised target of Rs 30,000 crore for FY24.Also Read | Budget 2024 income tax expectations: Top 5 things FM Sitharaman should do for taxpayers - from tax slab changes to hiking standard deduction Despite these successes, the government is not inclined to increase its revenue targets for FY25 from the levels set in the interim budget, the rationale being to guard against presenting ""estimates that will fall short of actual realisations and upset resource allocation plans,"" in the words of an official.A final decision on the specific asset monetisation target will be made closer to the budget presentation on July 23. The government anticipates significant proceeds from the planned privatisation of IDBI Bank and divestments in Shipping Corporation of India and NMDC Steel, among others, in FY25.Analysts at CareEdge Ratings have noted that with a substantial dividend of Rs 2.11 lakh crore from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the government's fiscal position remains robust, potentially reducing the urgency to aggressively pursue divestments.The combined target for divestment and asset monetisation represents just 1.6% of the government’s budgeted non-debt receipts for FY25, indicating a reduced reliance on these revenues to manage the fiscal deficit.Also Read | Budget 2024: Top 3 steps Modi government should consider for employment generation However, CareEdge analysts have identified a significant disinvestment potential of about Rs 11.5 lakh crore at current market valuations, assuming the government maintains at least a 51% stake in public firms and offloads excess shares.DIPAM Secretary Tuhin Kanta Pandey had previously emphasised that setting overly high annual disinvestment targets could create market uncertainties and adversely impact the value creation strategy for the CPSEs. Therefore, the government is committed to a ""calibrated disinvestment strategy"" to optimise outcomes, he said.","The Modi government is likely to maintain its revenue collection targets of nearly Rs 1 lakh crore for the fiscal year 2024-25 (FY25) This is through disinvestment, asset monetization, and dividends from non-financial Central Public Sector Enterprises ( CPSEs ), according to senior officials.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111780695,imgsize-49796,width-400,resizemode-4/111780695.jpg"
"Hit by curbs on export of Indian commodities, Malaysia refers to friendly ties to urge India to ensure supplies",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/hit-by-curbs-on-export-of-indian-commodities-malaysia-refers-to-friendly-ties-to-urge-india-to-ensure-supplies/articleshow/111849174.cms,"NEW DELHI: Feeling the pinch of curbs on exports of Indian rice , sugar and onions, Malaysian minister for plantation and commodities Datuk Seri Johari Abdul Ghani on Thursday invoked “friendly ties” to say that they would like New Delhi to have some “arrangement” to ensure their supply.Ghani said India’s restrictions on exports of agri commodities are bad for Malaysia.“We need sugar, onions and basmati rice. Our domestic rice production meets just 65% of our requirement and demand for basmati rice is rising. Around 25% of our people prefer basmati rice. We believe that India can allocate some quantities of these essential commodities for Malaysia even if there is an overall ban,” he told reporters.India, the world’s biggest exporter of rice and onions and the second biggest exporter of sugar, had imposed restrictions on shipment of these commodities to keep domestic prices under check.The reference to “friendly ties” assumes significance in view of the tension between the two countries over Malaysia’s refusal to extradite radical Islamic preacher, Zakir Naik, who is wanted here for a series of terror-related crimes. Naik, identified by many terror suspects as the inspiration for their turn to radicaliasation and jehadi violence, has since been given Malaysian citizenship, much to India's chagrin.Earlier speaking on the sidelines of an event organised by the Indian Vegetable Oil Producers’ Association, Ghani said, “If India opens up, it will be beneficial for Malaysia.” Malaysia, the second biggest exporter of palm oil to India, is caught in a challenging position due to export restrictions on food items.He also addressed growing concerns over health implications of the use of palm oil. Malaysia has been among the biggest exporters of palm oil to India and the minister said that there is no replacement of palm oil in future. Ghani said they don’t see any decline in export of palm oil to India considering population growth.He also met agriculture minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Thursday and offered its support in research and development, seed supply and management expertise to India in its oil palm mission. Under the the National Mission for edible oils, govt aims at increasing crude palm oil production to 28-30 lakh tonne by 2032-33. India imported 97.6 lakh tonne of palm oil and 30 lakh of this came from Malaysia in the oil year 2022-23 (October-September).","Ghani said India’s restrictions on exports of agri commodities are bad for Malaysia. “We need sugar, onions and basmati rice.

"Wipro: Wipro to uphold employee contracts, reassures Rishad Premji",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/wipro-to-uphold-employee-contracts-reassures-rishad-premji/articleshow/111847447.cms,"Bengaluru: Wipro said it will adhere to the contractual agreements it enters into with its employees. This underscores its stance on upholding the terms outlined in the contracts signed by its employees. “We are very particular in ensuring that the contracts we sign with our colleagues and employees, we hold to. And that philosophy hasn’t changed and will not change going forward.We do try to give everyone opportunities within the company, but if they find better opportunities outside, these people leave,” Wipro chairman Rishad Premji said at the firm’s annual general meeting on Thursday.Recently, Wipro had sought Rs 25 crore from its former CFO, Jatin Dalal, for breach of contract after he joined Cognizant as CFO immediately after leaving Wipro in November last year. The claim is based on the value of stock units granted to Dalal since he became chief financial officer in 2015. The company had said in the court filing that every one of the grants came with the condition that for a period of 12 months after his last date of employment, Dalal could not directly or indirectly engage with a competitor, could not solicit a Wipro customer to move the existing business to another party, and could not solicit a Wipro employee to be associated with a competitor, supplier, or customer. Recently, Cognizant paid Rs 4 crore to its CFO, Jatin Dalal, to settle the lawsuit and related arbitration with his former employer, Wipro.Premji said Wipro has an entrepreneurial and decentralized mindset that will allow employees to run their operations. One of the shareholders asked him how Premji was planning to arrest the churn at the top level, to which he said, “We have bred many CEOs that have gone out to build organisations... Entrepreneurship has always been a part of the secret sauce of Wipro, and it continues,” he added.Premji said that the 2023-24 financial year has been challenging for the company. “The global economic fluctuations this past year have affected our clients’ technology spending and led to uncertainty in market demands. However, despite these challenges, I believe the fundamentals of our business remain unchanged, and we remain fully committed to investing in our future. Although discretionary spending was subdued in the first half of the year, we saw promising signs in our consulting business in the second half, which is a positive early indicator,” he said.Premji said there’s been a significant shift in how businesses perceive AI, especially GenAI. “What was once a topic of curiosity has now become a cornerstone of long-term strategies for creating value. AI presents a distinct opportunity to reshape industries, reimagine experiences, enhance efficiencies, and foster innovation.”","Wipro said it will adhere to the contractual agreements it enters into with its employees.

Discover the latest update on the banking sector: outstanding loans rose by 4.8% and deposits grew by 5.3% in the first quarter. Loan growth continues to surpass deposit growth, with a notable influence from the HDFC-HDFC Bank merger.

Mumbai: HDFC Bank MD & CEO Sashidhar Jagdishan has said that the bank will grow its advances a little slower than the deposits and shun loan growth that does not meet the bank’s risk-adjusted profitability thresholds.In a letter to shareholders, Jagdishan said the bank aims to reduce the credit-to-deposit ratio to pre-merger levels and improve liquidity buffers while also paying off some previous borrowings of HDFC.After the merger, the credit-to-deposit ratio increased to 112% last year. This was lowered to 106% in the Dec quarter and further to 106% in March 2024.

Jyoti Mishra: Jyoti Mishra Fake IFS Officer Scandal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/jyoti-mishra-fake-ifs-officer-scandal/articleshow/111821705.cms,"LUCKNOW: Suresh Narain Mishra is a sub-inspector with the UP Police . Two years ago, he was in seventh heaven when his eldest daughter, Jyoti, cracked the coveted civil services exam . While he was flooded with calls, his daughter was the toast of the media for being a small-town girl who climbed the Everest of all exams.However, Mishra's world came crashing down when the Indian Embassy in Madrid, Spain, blew the lid off the world of falsehood and deceit his daughter had conjured.That she was not an IFS officer as they believed until Tuesday; that she was not working at the Indian embassy in Madrid; that she never cracked the civil services.Close on the heels of the Puja Khedkar case in Pune, here is a girl from Rae Bareli, who scored 96% in class XII and did well in graduation with Delhi University, but faked her UPSC result as another girl by the same name had cleared the exam by cleverly concealing that the 'successful Jyoti' was of scheduled caste.Jyoti Mishra confessed to TOI that there was no pressure from her parents to clear the civil services but did it after five from her peer group cracked the UPSC exam, but she couldn't in her first attempt. However, she ran out of luck when an X-user, pulling out June 2022 reports, claimed on Monday that despite being a Brahmin, she claimed SC quota.This is when the fake Jyoti came out of the shell with the claim that she is an IFS officer and never availed the quota, and her lies got exposed. When TOI approached her father, now posted in Lucknow, to know his and his daughter's version, he confidently said that his daughter was posted with the Indian embassy in Madrid and could be approached after working hours (10 pm IST).When TOI called up Jyoti Mishra through WhatsApp, she shared a screenshot of her X post in which she had repeated the claim. ""I found many misleading pieces of information against me and my career. So wanted to clear it for once to each and every person who is intentionally or unintentionally targeting me. The post in which a name appears, Jyoti to be SC and IAS is not me.She is IAS and she is from Haryana district. I am not IAS. I got IFS cadre and I was in another list,"" her post said. As proof of her claim, she shared documents meticulously collected by her to show her credentials -- a diplomatic passport, a letter from the UPSC about her selection and subsequent posting at Madrid, and an ID card of Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy Of Administration (LBSNAA). After this, TOI carried a story about her mistaken identity and sent a query to the Indian embassy to confirm her claims.On Tuesday, Aman Chandran, the second secretary handling press information and culture at the Embassy of India in Madrid, reverted to TOI's query on Jyoti Mishra and stated that there is no officer by her name working in this embassy. After this, when TOI dug deep to find out her whereabouts, it was revealed that she was in Delhi and admitted to her 'guilt' over a long conversation with a TOI reporter.“The ghost from the past came back on Monday when a few social media users were targeting me by using my visuals, and an actual list of civil services examination 2021- service allocation in which Jyoti, an SC candidate, made it into IAS with 432 rank.The social media users were peddling a false narrative that I, as a general category candidate, took reservation under the SC category to become IAS, which is untrue because I have never cleared any UPSC exam,” she told TOI. As per the copy of the fake second iteration PDF of the civil services examination 2021-service allocation list shared with TOI by her father, Suresh Narain Mishra, 432 rank is allotted to Jyoti Mishra under the general category with roll number 5904317.In the actual list, 432 rank is allotted to Jyoti of the reserved SC category with roll number 843910. She could manage this 'roleplay' for two years only because Jyoti was duping just her parents and no one else. Mrs. and Mr. Mishra had no reason not to believe their daughter who did well academically.Her visits to her parents were few and far between. She had last visited them 'from Madrid' one and a half months ago. In June 2022, when the UPSC results were declared, her 'achievement' was not only highlighted by the local media, but the UP Police also posted a congratulatory message for her and two other wards of cops. “I just couldn’t accept that afew of my peer group cleared the civil services, & I couldn’t.I wanted to prove myself, but somehow my track got changed, and I couldn’t accept the failure and misled everyone into believing me that I’m an IFS,” said Jyoti (25). Her crestfallen father, meanwhile, had an incredulous look when TOI apprised him of his daughter's real status. “Till date, I believed that my daughter was an IFS officer attached to the Madridbased Indian embassy.I don’t understand why she had to lie to us. We never pressured her for anything. She was good at academics. I don’t know where in the world she is currently living, but I want her to return home,” he told TOI.","Suresh Narain Mishra's eldest daughter, Jyoti, cracked the coveted civil services exam two years ago.

Global airline passenger traffic expected to double in 20 years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/global-airline-passenger-traffic-expected-to-double-in-20-years/articleshow/111833621.cms,"PARIS: Airlines expect overall passenger numbers to double over the next two decades from the 4.3 billion who flew last year, with growth led by emerging markets such as Asia Pacific and the Middle East , the main global airline body said Thursday.The projected surge in traffic could put further pressure on carriers to contribute to the fight against climate change and make progress towards a pledge to reach ""net zero"" carbon emissions by 2050.Average annual passenger growth is expected to be 3.6 percent a year to 2043, compared with a forecast of 9.7 percent growth this year, the International Air Transport Association said in its latest update.The Asia Pacific region would lead with average growth of 4.8 percent, propelled by countries like India (6.9 percent) and China (5.8 percent) but also Thailand and Vietnam (6.4 percent each), the IATA said.Passenger growth in Africa and the Middle East would rise by 3.6 percent, while Latin American and the Caribbean would see a 2.9 percent increase.The mature markets of North America and Europe would see growth of 1.7 percent and two percent, the association said.Air transport currently accounts for less than three percent of global CO2 emissions, but is often in the firing line because it serves a minority of the world's population.Airlines are mainly betting on increased production of sustainable aviation fuels produced from renewable sources, expected to provide 65 percent of the industry's ""net zero"" target for 2050.But the technological challenges of producing such fuels at scale -- they currently provide just 0.53 percent of airlines' fuel consumption -- are likely to require huge investments.",Asia Pacific region would lead with average growth of 4.8 percent.

TAIPEI: Taiwan's TSMC , the world's largest contract chipmaker, raised its full-year revenue forecast on Thursday given surging demand for chips used in artificial intelligence, and rejected the idea of a joint venture factory in the United States.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC), a major Apple Inc and Nvidia supplier, has benefited from the global AI boom that has helped it weather the tapering off of pandemic-led electronics demand.The bellwether for the chip industry earlier on Thursday posted net profit that beat market expectations.

Stock traders in Asia are ramping up the Trump trade in preparation for a potential second term for the former US president, which will likely create winners and losers in the region.Donald Trump ’s “America first” policies on trade, defense and other industries would hamper the outlook of a myriad of sectors in Asia from agriculture and farm equipment to textiles and weapons production.Asian companies’ momentum in the global race for electric vehicles and chips could slow should a Trump administration follow through on his pledges.China is seen as a clear loser given Trump’s call for higher tariffs and confrontational rhetoric against the world’s second largest economy. Taiwan and South Korea, which are heavily reliant on export revenues from semiconductor and other tech sectors, are also staring at an outlook downturn, market watchers say.India is deemed as a potential beneficiary should the former US president’s polling hold up and lead to his win in November. Southeast Asian economies, whose fortunes aren’t closely tied to exports, may be able to deflect much of the fallout from a change in the White House, investors say.Here is what market watchers are saying“India stands out as an economy that is relatively shielded from these shocks as the country has only a small share of global goods markets and is less exposed to China-related risks.”“It looks like India has a much better relationship with the US than China. At least from India’s side, the impact of Trump was not as bad as it was for many other emerging markets. It’s difficult to think it’ll be different this time.”“China’s obviously going to be one of the most affected if those tariffs really come in place and if Trump successfully can put enough pressure on the EU to also put some tariffs of their own on China.”Still, “a lot of companies are diversifying their markets or starting to diversify the supply chains and build manufacturing facilities outside of China. And even if a Trump presidency imposes high tariffs, Europe might decide not to follow it unless there is some really super strong political pressure.”“For Japan, we believe that risks are more balanced than China as the country’s sensitivity to global trade is a bit lower, and its relations with the US will likely remain solid even under the Trump administration.”“We also see the opportunity for the country to cement its semiconductor sector renaissance if Taiwan or South Korea end up bearing the brunt of the Trump team’s potentially consequential re-calibration of the US strategy for them.”“In Asia, the biggest beneficiaries are likely to be Vietnam, Taiwan, and Malaysia. Vietnam has been benefiting from the lower-end manufacturing, such as textile and wooden furniture, while Taiwan and Malaysia have been benefiting from electronic products supply chain shifts.”“Southeast Asia will be in a pretty good position because of what’s happening with China. So in that sense, Southeast Asia would be good. Thailand even, well, Vietnam may get into some trouble because they’re doing so much manufacturing of Chinese goods, but they’re also doing a lot of manufacturing for Korea.”“For Asia, it would really affect the tech-related ones more. It’s really whether the momentum trade of Taiwan, Korea is going to continue a bit longer, versus Asean being a bit more resilient, less tied to the tech sector, and having the China plus one strategy and secular themes playing out.”","Donald Trump ’s “America first” policies on trade, defense and other industries would hamper the outlook of a myriad of sectors in Asia.

The Reuters poll had pointed to a slightly weaker 5.6per cent increase.Sterling rose against the dollar immediately after the data was published.The BoE - which has a target of consumer price inflation of 2 per cent - has expressed concern about the strength of services inflation, which largely reflects pressure from wage growth in a labour market short of candidates to fill jobs.Data due on Thursday is expected to show wages growing slightly less strongly than in data published a month ago but still rising by almost 6per cent - roughly double the rate that would be compatible with keeping inflation at 2per cent.The BoE is due to announce its next decision on interest rates on Aug. 1 and investors see a roughly 50per cent chance of a first cut to borrowing costs since 2020.A rate cut next month would give an early boost to new Prime Minister Keir Starmer and his finance minister Rachel Reeves who have said they will speed up the slow-moving British economy after winning power in a landslide election two weeks ago.But last week the BoE's Chief Economist, Huw Pill, said he was focused on persistently strong price pressures and said the timing of the first rate cut was an open question.Core inflation - excluding volatile food and energy prices - held at 3.5 per cent in the 12 months to June, the ONS said, matching the median forecast in the Reuters poll.The BoE had expected headline inflation of 2.0 per cent in June and services inflation of 5.1per cent, according to forecasts it published two months ago.

The 160 year old lender has traditionally appointed its CEO from within.Since 2020, Elhedery has been the co head of the Global banking and markets business, the division that houses HSBC's trading and investment banking advisory businesses.Lebanon born Elhedery, who began his career in banking as a rates trader before joining HSBC in 2005, was named the surprise successor to Ewen Stevenson as CFO in October 2022, just weeks after returning from a sabbatical.He also led HSBC's Middle Eastern, North Africa and Turkiye region as the CEO of that division between July 2016 and February 2019.""Working together with our talented team, I look forward to delivering exceptional value to our clients and investors by driving strong performance on a sustainable growth trajectory,"" he said in the bank's statement announcing his appointment.Quinn, who led the global lender for five years, will remain CEO until his successor starts in the role.His surprise departure was announced in April, and at that time he had said he wanted a better work life balance and planned to pursue a portfolio career.Quinn oversaw a raft of asset sales, navigated a global pandemic and a push by rebel investors to break up the 160 year bank, and guided the lender to record profit.The move comes at a time when HSBC, Europe's largest lender by assets with a balance sheet of $3 trillion, is betting on its historic Asian ties to ramp up profit.Since the financial crisis of 2008, HSBC has already shrunk its global footprint by around a quarter, exiting low growth markets to plough capital and resources into Asia.The bank's shares have risen 7% this year, against an 18% gain in the STOXX Europe banks index.HSBC said it will announce Elhedery's successor as Group CFO in due course. Ahead of the announcement, the bank was exploring financial incentives and reallocating key projects to retain those who miss out on the top job, two people with knowledge of the discussions told Reuters.HSBC will report its annual results on July 31.The lender's shares in Hong Kong were trading mostly flat after the announcement.","Georges Elhedery, 50, becomes HSBC's third CEO in less than eight years.

This rally was fueled by expectations of potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve in 2024, which could boost the economy and corporate profits. The positive sentiment was further supported by strong earnings reports from major companies like Bank of America and UnitedHealth Group.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 742.76 points, or 1.85%, to 40,954.48, the S&P 500 gained 35.98 points, or 0.64%, at 5,667.2 and the Nasdaq Composite added 36.77 points, or 0.2%, at 18,509.34.Of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500, industrials enjoyed the largest percentage gains, while technology and communication services were the only two sectors to end in negative territory.Economically sensitive small caps extended their rally. The Russell 2000 scored a fifth straight day of gains greater than 1%, its longest winning streak since April 2000. The index gained 3.5%, touching its highest level since January 2022.Federal Reserve Governor Adriana Kugler's comments about the possibility of lowering interest rates sooner if the job market cools ""too much"" added to the optimism on Wall Street. Analysts believe that the current market environment assumes a perfect scenario where the Fed cuts rates while inflation slows down without pushing the economy into a recession. Additionally, rising expectations of a Donald Trump victory in the 2024 US presidential election, which could lead to tax cuts and deregulation, further contributed to the bullish sentiment.In contrast to the US market, European bourses experienced declines, with German investor confidence falling for the first time in a year. The International Monetary Fund maintained its global growth forecast for this year at 3.2% but trimmed its projections for the United States and Japan while warning of ongoing inflation risks and trade tensions.Gold prices also reached a new record, jumping 1.9% to $2,450.07 per ounce, driven by shifting expectations regarding the Fed's monetary policy.

"'Just like real': Bill Gates-backed startup makes butter out of air, claims it tastes really good",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/just-like-real-bill-gates-backed-startup-makes-butter-out-of-air-claims-it-tastes-really-good/articleshow/111782626.cms,"A startup based in California , has claimed to have developed a process for creating butter without the use of milk or any other dairy product.The company, named Savor , backed by Microsoft founder Bill Gates said it produces butter using a combination of carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and oxygen chains, and asserts that the resulting product ""tastes like the real thing"", as reported by The Guardian.Savor has been conducting experiments to create dairy-free alternatives for various products, including ice-cream, cheese, and milk. The company employs a thermochemical process that enables them to develop fat molecules using gases, rather than relying on traditional dairy sources.The livestock industry is responsible for a significant portion of global greenhouse gas emissions , accounting for 14.5 percent according to the United Nations.Reducing the consumption of meat and dairy products is considered one of the essential ways to mitigate the environmental impact of this industry.Savor has said that their products will have a substantially lower carbon footprint compared to their animal-based counterparts.Real butter has a carbon footprint of 16.9kg CO2 equivalent per kg, while the butter created by Savor has a carbon footprint of less than 0.8g CO2 equivalent per kg, highlighting the potential environmental benefits of this innovative approach todairy-free butter production, as reported by The Guardian.Backing this idea on his blogpost, Bill Gates wrote: ""It might sound like a pipe dream, but a company called Savor (which I’m invested in) is in the process of doing it. They started with the fact that all fats are made of varying chains of carbon and hydrogen atoms. Then they set out to make those same carbon and hydrogen chains—without involving animals or plants. They ultimately developed a process that involves taking carbon dioxide from the air and hydrogen from water, heating them up, and oxidizing them to trigger the separation of fatty acids and then the formulation of fat. The result is real fat molecules like the ones we get from milk, cheese, and vegetable oils.""“The process doesn’t release any greenhouse gases, and it uses no farmland and less than a thousandth of the water that traditional agriculture does. And most important, it tastes really good – like the real thing, because chemically it is,” he c.""The idea of switching to lab-made fats and oils may seem strange at first. But their potential to significantly reduce our carbon footprint is immense. By harnessing proven technologies and processes, we get one step closer to achieving our climate goals,"" he added.However the Savor's butter, crafted through innovative techniques, is not yet ready for commercial distribution.Savor's chief executive, Kathleen Alexander said: “We are currently pre-commercial and working through regulatory approval to be able to sell our butter. We are not expecting to be able to move forward with any kind of sales until at least 2025. So far, we had informal taste panels with tens of people. We expect to perform a more formal panel as part of our commercialisation and scale-up efforts.”","California-based startup Savor claims to have developed a process for creating butter without the use of milk or any other dairy product. The company employs a thermochemical process that enables them to develop fat molecules using gases, rather than relying on traditional dairy sources. Savor's butter is not yet ready for commercial distribution.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111783346,imgsize-27154,width-400,resizemode-4/111783346.jpg"

'Lower expectations'

SHANGHAI: At a job fair for soon-to-be graduates in central Shanghai, recruiters sat bored under washed-out tarpaulins as rain and an apparent lack of interest kept potential young employees away.The empty seats belied China's stubbornly high youth unemployment rate -- a problem so pressing that President Xi Jinping has told top Communist Party (CCP) cadres it should be a ""top priority"".His words have been seen by many analysts as a signal that reforms could be in the pipeline ahead of the ongoing Third Plenum, a meeting that has historically unveiled important changes in economic policy direction.Youth unemployment stood at 14.2% in May, official data showed -- and last month, another 11.8 million students graduated from university, adding to the bottleneck.That number had soared to an unprecedented 21.3% in mid-2023 before officials paused publishing monthly figures. They began releasing them again in December after adjusting the calculation method.Hospitality and human resources firms dominated the small job fair in late May, one of many hosted by local authorities in anticipation of an influx of university leavers.""It's difficult to find a job that matches your degree and aspirations,"" one of the few young jobseekers at the fair, a data sciences student, told AFP.""Lots of college students actually have too high expectations,"" said Julia Shao, who was recruiting for a restaurant chain.""They do not prefer this kind of basic position. They prefer... a fancy job.""Xi specifically mentioned graduates in a speech to the CCP Politburo in May, noting that ""more jobs should be created for them to apply what they have learned and what they are adept at"".His remarks follow ""a steady drumbeat of comments from China's leadership underlining the urgency"" of the matter, Erica Tay, director of macro research at Maybank, told AFP.The issue has been hanging over the government for some time.Together with persistently low consumption and a long-running property sector crisis, the unemployment situation has been labelled a key culprit for China's uneven post-pandemic recovery.""While details in Xi's comments are vague, it's clear a policy shift is under way,"" said Harry Murphy Cruise of Moody's Analytics.""We expect policies aimed at reducing youth unemployment to be a key pillar of the discussions (at the Third Plenum).""Xi has said young people should be encouraged ""to find jobs or start businesses in key fields (and) industries"".""Market-oriented and social channels should be expanded for young people to find a job,"" he was quoted as saying.Murphy Cruise said he expected the government to increase wage subsidies to persuade companies to hire recent graduates, as well as create more work placements for students.However, these were only ""band-aid solutions"", he said.In the long term, ""larger industrial and education policy reforms"" were needed to ensure a better match between graduates' skills and employer demands, he said.There is now a push to fill roles that ""dovetail with key policy priorities"" or where skills shortages exist, said Tay, like industrial upgrading and scientific innovation.With job opportunities drying up for those holding sociology, journalism and law degrees, she said, some kind of ""government-sponsored earn-as-you-learn training programmes"" might be needed to fill more in-demand roles.Near the law faculty of a top Shanghai university, final-year students said the job market was indeed tough.""Post-pandemic, it is a little more difficult than before,"" 22-year-old Qian Le said, referencing recent layoffs and pay cuts at top Chinese law firms.""Even those who are already in jobs may not be able to keep them, so it may be more difficult for new people to get in.""Qian and her classmate Wang Hui had both opted to pursue further study.""The economic situation is quite sluggish, many companies have gone bankrupt, and many jobs have been reduced,"" Wang told AFP.China's once-freewheeling private sector has slowed significantly, in part because of past government crackdowns on companies including tech giants and private tutoring firms.Many young people are opting to study for civil service exams -- seen as a more stable option -- or like Wang and Qian, taking on post-graduate degrees.In March, universities urged their students to actively look for jobs instead, said Tay.But ""competition is huge, and the number of undergraduates is gradually increasing every year"", Wang said.Karl Hu, another law student, said the difficulty was not in finding a job.The problem was finding ""a suitable career"" in terms of salary level and benefits, he explained.He himself had secured a good job at a bank, he said -- but many would have to ""lower their expectations"".","Youth unemployment stood at 14.2% in May, official data showed.
