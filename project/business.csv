'Smart' multi-layer perimeter security for 30 more IAF bases,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/smart-multi-layer-perimeter-security-for-30-more-iaf-bases/articleshow/109210182.cms,"NEW DELHI: With the threat of terror attacks on military establishments remaining a clear and present danger, the IAF has now kicked off a plan to upgrade the ground perimeter security of 30 more of its air bases around the country.The new comprehensive multi-layered, multi-sensor, hi-tech surveillance and intrusion detection systems at the 30 air bases will follow the ongoing installation of a similar integrated perimeter security system ( IPSS ) at 23 “crucial and sensitive” air bases.“Of the 23 high-priority air bases, the IPSS is now functional at 17-18 after some delay. Now, the plan is to install the IPSS, with some additional features and upgrades, at 30 more air bases,” a senior officer told TOI.The government had approved the IPSS for the first 23 air bases, with Bharat Electronics (BEL) as the lead contractor and several foreign sub-contractors, after JeM terrorists attacked the Pathankot airbase in January 2016 to expose gaping holes in the security set-up of military installations. The “pilot” IPSS project at the Pathankot airbase was subsequently launched, and eventually commissioned in February 2021.As per the request for information (RFI) now issued to Indian companies, IAF wants the IPSS at the 30 air bases to have five layers for intrusion detection and monitoring, which will all be integrated with AI-enabled software and automation network, for “a composite surveillance picture with video analytics to generate decision-making solutions”.The layers will include an electrical smart power fence, CCTV cameras with infra-red illuminators, radars, underground vibration detection systems (UVDS) with dedicated optical fibre cables, and dual PTZ (pan, tilt, zoom) thermal and visible cameras.Moreover, the gap-free system should also have mini UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) for aerial surveillance. “The UVDS should be capable of detecting vibrations generated by human intruders while walking, crawling and tunnelling across the perimeter,” another officer said.IAF has asked vendors to submit their response to the RFI by June 24, in a move that comes soon after Baloch militants attacked yet another naval air base in Pakistan on March 25.In India, the need to urgently revamp the security infrastructure around military installations and bases has also been repeatedly reinforced by the series of terror strikes on Pathankot, Uri, Nagrota, Akhnoor and other camps in recent years.The low-cost, high-impact attacks exposed several chinks in the existing set-up, ranging from the lack of proper perimeter security and upgraded standard operating procedures to the absence of regular security audits and seamless coordination between intelligence and security agencies.During the Pathankot strike in January 2016, it had taken the security forces, who lost seven of their own personnel, almost three days to kill the four heavily-armed JeM terrorists who had easily slipped into the air base. The incident had come soon after PM Narendra Modi made an unscheduled trip to Lahore to attend the wedding of Nawaz Sharif’s granddaughter there, leading to a nose-dive in bilateral ties.","IAF has kicked off a plan to upgrade the ground perimeter security of 30 more of its air bases around the country.

CJI-led bench tears into 2021 SC order in favour of Reliance Infrastructure,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cji-led-bench-tears-into-2021-sc-order-in-favour-of-reliance-infrastructure/articleshow/109205060.cms,"DAMEPL to refund any amount it withdrew: SC

NEW DELHI: Anil Ambani 's Reliance Infrastructure suffered a crushing blow on Wednesday as Supreme Court snatched away the Rs 2,782 crore arbitral award in favour of its subsidiary, Delhi Airport Metro Express Pvt Ltd ( DAMEPL ), which has swelled to Rs 8,000 crore with interest. The award against Delhi Metro ""suffered from the vice of perversity and patent illegality"", it ruled.SC has usually been reluctant to interfere with arbitral awards but a bench of Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud and Justices B R Gavai and Surya Kant justified the ""harsh step"" by saying it was necessitated by the ""grave miscarriage of justice"" that marked the apex court's earlier verdict which resulted in ""undeserved windfall"" to DAMEPL.Reacting to the verdict, the company said, ""Reliance Infrastructure wishes to clarify that the order dated April 10 passed by the Supreme Court does not impose any liability on Reliance Infrastructure and the company has not received any money from DMRC/DAMEPL under the arbitral award.""The setback for Reliance Infra, just when it had seemed set to walk away with a huge pile of cash, was in keeping with the rollercoaster trajectory the dispute has taken since DAMEPL refused to continue operating the Airport Express, leaving Delhi Metro saddled with a project which, despite its rich potential, had not taken off.Hailing the SC verdict quashing the arbitral award granted to Delhi Airport Metro Express Pvt Ltd (DAMEPL) as ""historic"", Union urban affairs minister Hardeep Puri congratulated DMRC on achieving the ""landmark verdict"".""Our public sector utilities are strong & resolute in delivery of public service under the firm leadership of PM Modi and remain steadfast in pursuit of fairness & justice,"" he said on X.Reliance Infrastructure says the company has not received any money from DMRC/DAMEPL under the arbitral award. The setback for Reliance Infra, just when it seemed set to walk away with a huge pile of cash, was in keeping with the rollercoaster trajectory the dispute has taken since DAMEPL suspended operations of Airport Express, leaving Delhi Metro with a project which, despite its rich potential, had not taken off.After operations on Airport Express were suspended, DAMEPL took the matter to arbitration as per its contract with DMRC. The arbitral tribunal comprising A P Mishra, S S Khurana and H L Bajaj asked DMRC to pay Rs 2,782 crore with interest to DAMEPL. A single judge of Delhi high court upheld the order but it was reversed by an HC division bench led by Justice Sanjiv Khanna (now an SC judge). DAMEPL had cited non-rectification of defects on track and civil work by DMRC. On Sept 19, 2021, an SC bench of Justices L N Rao and S R Bhat upheld the award, after which DAMEPL started execution proceedings before HC.Critical of the SC’s 2021 judgment for interfering with a well-considered decision of division bench of Delhi HC, the bench of Justices Chandrachud, Gavai and Kant allowed DMRC’s curative petition, discontinued the execution proceedings and ordered return of the amount deposited by DMRC.It also said if any amount deposited was withdrawn by DAMEPL, then that would be refunded to DMRC.","Anil Ambani's Reliance Infrastructure suffered a crushing blow on Wednesday.

"Your apology not worth paper it's written on, SC tells Ramdev; slams Uttarakhand government",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/your-apology-not-worth-paper-its-written-on-sc-tells-ramdev-slams-uttarakhand-government/articleshow/109205292.cms,"We will rip you apart, SC tells Uttarakhand government in Patanjali case

NEW DELHI: More trouble seems to be in store for Baba Ramdev , his disciple Balkrishna and Patanjali Ayurved , with Supreme Court on Wednesday toughening its stand against them in a contempt case for issuing misleading advertisements in violation of its order, turning down their unconditional apology and asking them to be ready for the consequences.""Your apology is not worth the paper it's written on, we decline to accept it.It was a deliberate violation of the court's order and undertaking given to the court (to refrain from misleading claims and advertisements). Tendering apology is not enough. You suffer the consequences. We do not want to be generous in this case. We are wondering why we should not treat your apology with the same disdain with which you treated the undertaking,"" a bench of Justices Hima Kohli and Ahsanuddin Amanullah said while emphasising that the yoga guru and his associate, both of whom were present in court, had sought to mislead the court by making false statements in order to dodge summons for personal appearance.The bench also lambasted Uttarakhand govt for not taking any action against Patanjali Ayurved in the past five years since the complaint was filed in 2018 and said the court would ""rip the authority apart"" for being in slumber. “We are not going to leave you. We will rip you apart. Except for pushing your files, your officers did nothing. It looks that you were not even aware of the law. You are hand in glove with them,” the bench told the state licensing authority.The court issued notice to all district Ayurvedic and Unani officers of Haridwar who handled the charge from 2018 onwards. Ramdev and his disciple are also in trouble on other counts as the bench noted that they tried to wriggle out of personal appearance by stating on affidavit that they were to visit a foreign country but there was no ticket at the time of filing the affidavit — something which comes within the ambit of perjury.At the outset of the hearing, the bench said the contemnors were taking the court very lightly and added that the apology was tendered under duress to save themselves as the contemptuous acts had been committed thrice.As senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for Ramdev and Balkrishna, and solicitor general Tushar Mehta said the affidavit was filed as per their instruction and asked what more could be done by them, the court said, “You have done what you could but we are not convinced.” The counsel pleaded that the case be heard after 10 days but the bench told them that it was for the court to decide and posted the case to April 16.After Patanjali, it was the turn of the state licensing authority to face the music from SC for “deliberately keeping their eyes shut” over the years and not taking action against the company for violating the Drugs and Magic Remedies (Objectionable Advertisements) Act. It said the state kept twiddling its thumbs when the law was being violated with impunity by the company. “We are appalled that except for pushing files, the state licensing authority did nothing. First time, misleading advertisements were brought to your notice in 2018. In all these five years, the authority remained in deep slumber,” the bench said.The incumbent officer, who has been in the post for nine months, appeared before the court with folded hands and said he could not be made accountable for the delay and assured to take prompt action as per law. “Now, wisdom has dawned upon you in just half-an-hour,” the bench said and issued notice to his predecessor who held the post for three years and sought his explanation for the inaction.Ramdev and Balkrishna, who have been asked to appear again on April 16, acknowledge the mistake and promised not to issue misleading advertisements of their products in violation of law. They pledged to uphold the majesty of law and majesty of justice.“I, hereby, tender my unconditional apology in regard to the issue of advertisements which occurred after the statement of counsel of respondent No.5 (Patanjali Ayurved) which was recorded in the order dated Nov 21, 2023, which I am informed has the force of an injunction. I sincerely regret this lapse and I wish to assure the court that the same will not be repeated. I further undertake and ensure that the said statement shall be complied with in letter and spirit and no such similar advertisements shall be issued. I further tender my unconditional and unqualified apology for the press conference held on Nov 22. I regret this lapse and assure that the same will not be repeated again in future,” Ramdev said in his affidavit.Ramdev had held a press conference on Nov 22, just a day after SC passed an order in which the company’s undertaking was recorded that it would not issue misleading advertisements. However, the company continued taking out full-page advertisements in newspapers.","Supreme Court turns down unconditional apology from Patanjali Ayurved. Justices Hima Kohli and Ahsanuddin Amanullah lambasted Uttarakhand govt for not taking any action against PatanJali. “We are appalled that except for pushing files, the state licensing authority did nothing. In all these five years, the authority remained in deep slumber,” the bench said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109205327,imgsize-47124,width-400,resizemode-4/109205327.jpg"
India posts defence attaches to several new nations for 1st time,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-posts-defence-attaches-to-several-new-nations-for-1st-time/articleshow/109205408.cms,"NEW DELHI: India has begun to post military and defence attachés to several new countries in a big move to expand strategic ties with key regions across the globe as well as push arms exports .Government sources on Wednesday said 15-16 new attachés from the Army, Navy and IAF are now being posted to countries like Poland, Armenia, Tanzania, Mozambique, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Ivory Coast and the Philippines after “ some rationalization” by cutting down the number of military officials posted at the large missions in Russia, the UK and France.“Some of them have already joined their new posts. In the next phase, 10 entirely new defence wings will be created in different countries, with a particular focus on nations to which arms can be exported,” a source said.A special area of interest is Africa , which is in line with the stepped-up military outreach to the continent where China has made huge strategic inroads. Apart from the ongoing combat exercises, military exchanges and training programmes with African countries, India is now trying to export indigenous Tejas fighters, Pinaka multi-launch rocket systems, BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles and Akash air defence missile systems to them.India had also worked hard to induct the 55-nation African Union as a permanent member of the G-20 during her presidency of the grouping last year.Among other African countries like Tanzania, Mozambique and Ivory Coast, the small but strategically-located Djibouti will also get an Indian defence attaché now. China, incidentally, established its first overseas base at Djibouti on the Horn of Africa in August 2017, and has been on overdrive ever since to establish additional logistical turnaround facilities from the African east coast to the Malacca Strait in the Indian Ocean Region.The former Soviet republic of Armenia has also emerged as a major arms exports destination, with deals already inked for Pinaka rockets, Akash missiles, ammunition and the like, a few of them coming even during its clash with Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh. “A defence attaché is especially being posted to Armenia for the first time,” the source said.With an eye on China’s aggressive behaviour in the Indo-Pacific, including the South China Sea, India has also been steadily stepping up military ties with ASEAN countries. This led to the $375 million contract for three anti-ship coastal batteries of the BrahMos missiles being inked with the Philippines in January 2022.India wants this first-ever BrahMos export order to pave the way for more such deals with the Philippines as well as other ASEAN countries like Indonesia and Vietnam.India is also trying to export the single-engine Tejas fighter to countries like the Philippines, Nigeria, Argentina and Egypt. India’s bid to sell it to Malaysia, however, had failed last year with the Royal Malaysian Air Force picking South Korean supersonic fighter KAI FA-50 made by Korean Aerospace Industries.","15-16 new attachés from the Army, Navy and IAF are now being posted to countries like Poland, Armenia, Tanzania, Mozambique, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Ivory Coast and the Philippines.

"India, China must urgently address LAC situation: PM",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-china-must-urgently-address-lac-situation-pm/articleshow/109205389.cms,"India natural pick of those looking to rejig supply chains’

New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said that India and China need to quickly address the prolonged situation on the border so that they can put behind them the abnormality in bilateral relations, even as he highlighted India's attraction as the ""natural choice"" for those seeking to diversify supply chains.""For India, the relationship with China is important and significant.It is my belief that we need to urgently address the prolonged situation on our border so that the abnormality in our bilateral interactions can be put behind us,"" Modi told Newsweek in an interview.""Stable and peaceful relations between India and China are important for not just our two countries but the entire region and the world. I hope and believe that through positive and constructive bilateral engagement at the diplomatic and military levels, we will be able to restore and sustain peace and tranquillity on our borders,"" he added.Asked about Quad, the grouping of India, US, Australia and Japan which China sees as an attempt to encircle it, the PM made it clear that the group was not targeted at any country, but asserted that the four member nations were ""demonstrating their vision of a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific"".Listing out measures taken by his govt, Modi positioned India, a “democratic polity”, as “a natural choice for those looking to diversify their supply chains”.“Given our strengths, India is now globally considered most suited for manufacturing world-class goods at competitive cost. Apart from producing for the world, the vast Indian domestic market is an added attraction. India is a perfect destination for those who want to set up trusted and resilient supply chains,” Modi said.Addressing a question on democracy and free press, the PM argued that democracy was in Indian genes. “A democracy like India is able to move ahead and function only because there is a vibrant feedback mechanism. And our media plays an important role in this regard... There are a few people in India and in the West who have lost (connection with) the people of India — their thought processes, feelings and aspirations. These people also tend to live in their own echo chamber of alternate realities. They conflate their own dissonance with the people with dubious claims of diminishing media freedom,” he said.Modi also dismissed suggestions that there was discrimination against minorities. “These are the usual tropes of some people who don’t bother to meet people outside their bubbles. Even India’s minorities don’t buy this narrative any more,” he said.Dwelling on the significance of Ram temple in Ayodhya, the PM said he carried with him “the aspirations of countless devotees, (who were) eagerly anticipating this day”. “The return of Shri Ram to his birthplace marked a historic moment of unity for the nation. It was a culmination of centuries of perseverance and sacrifice,” he added.On leadership, PM Modi said he was a keen listener and suggested that leaders should follow a bottom-to-top feedback channel, with multiple channels of feedback.“Listening is an important quality for leadership. I am god-gifted with this quality, and I have also cultivated it. Another quality that I have is that I am always in the moment. I am not distracted by phone calls, messages or anything else. When I am doing something, I am 100% involved and engrossed in that task,” he said. He also argued that building new infrastructure was not at variance with India’s position on combating climate change.“India offers a credible model of how to enhance physical infrastructure and yet be at the forefront of mitigating climate change. Be it lighting 10 million homes through (the) rooftop solar programme or empowering farmers with solar-powered pumps, be it distributing 400 million energy-efficient bulbs and ensuring 13 million efficient streetlights or having one of the fastest adoption of EVs, be it airports or railway stations or bridges, our infrastructure is leveraging renewable energy,” he said.","PM Narendra Modi says India and China need to quickly address the prolonged situation on the border so that they can put behind them the abnormality in bilateral relations.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Wednesday denied urgent hearing to Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal who moved the court questioning the correctness of day-old Delhi high court order rejecting his petition challenging his March 21 arrest by Enforcement Directorate in the alleged liquor policy scam.Appearing before a bench of CJI D Y Chandrachud and Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra, senior advocate A M Singhvi said, ""HC was not shown statements by persons who gave clean chit to the CM as ED termed them un-relied statements.This is impermissible. Please list the petition for hearing at the earliest possible time. There is a grave urgency.""The CJI told Singhvi to adhere to the set procedure of sending an email, which he would look into by afternoon and list the petition for hearing as soon as possible. The email was sent and the CJI perused it in the afternoon only to decline an urgent hearing.As the apex court has holidays on Thursday and Friday, the earliest that Kejriwal's lawyers could expect listing of his petition for hearing is on Monday. Kejriwal said in his petition, ""Intervention of SC is urgently warranted, as over and above the issue of illegal curtailment of liberty, my arrest also constitutes an unprecedented assault on the tenets of democracy based on 'free and fair elections' and 'federalism', both of which form significant constituents of the basic structure of the Constitution.""Accusing Union govt of misusing central agencies to arrest him with mala fide intentions just five days after announcement of general elections, the Delhi CM said it would cause grave prejudice to AAP and disturb the level playing field, a pre-requisite for free and fair elections. He said ED had fabricated evidence and coerced various people to give false statements against him and argued that no case of money laundering was made out against him.Holding the arrest valid, Delhi HC’s Justice Swarana Kanta Sharma had dismissed Kejriwal’s petition Tuesday, saying, “The material which has been encapsulated reveals that Arvind Kejriwal had allegedly conspired with other persons and was involved in the formulation of Delhi excise policy 2021-22, in the process of demanding kickbacks from the South Group, as well as in generation, use and concealment of proceeds of crime.”Kejriwal said statements of persons who gave a clean chit to him were suppressed by ED. “This intentional act of concealing pertinent information serves to undermine the integrity of the investigative process, disregard for due process and principles of justice,” he said.Asserting that no incriminating material was found by ED against him, the CM said the agency relied upon statements of Manish Sisodia’s secretary C Arvind Kumar, BRS MLC K Kavitha’s CA Buchi Babu, Magunta Srinivasalu Reddy (liquor tycoon and Andhra politician who recently crossed over from YSRCP to TDP),and his son Raghav Magunta who has turned approver, and Aurobindo Pharma’s director Sarath Reddy, all of whom were “coerced to give statements against him”. These statements were available with ED from Dec 2022 till July 2023, yet no corroborative material was ever found, a scenario that confirmed that he was arrested only to disable opposition in the elections, Kejriwal alleged.He also said there was no substance in the allegations that Rs 45 crore was transferred to Goa and utilised for AAP’s election campaign.Justice Sharma of Delhi HC had found Kejriwal prima facie involved on two counts. “First, in his personal capacity as he was involved in formulation of the excise policy and in demanding kickbacks. Second, in his capacity as national convener of AAP as per Section 70(1) of Prevention of Money Laundering Act, for use of proceeds of crime of Rs 45 crore in the election campaign of AAP in Goa elections in 2022, which is prima facie apparent from the material relief upon by ED,” the judge said.",Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal moved the court questioning the correctness of day-old Delhi high court order rejecting his petition challenging his March 21 arrest.

""I don't want my name to be involved in such acts. I don't think we have the morality left to govern,"" he said, in an apparent reference to the ongoing investigation into the alleged excise policy scam and the arrest of CM Arvind Kejriwal . Anand himself is being investigated in a money laundering case. ED had, in Nov last year, conducted a raid at Anand's residence, apart from 12 other locations in Delhi-NCR, UP and Kolkata.The searches were based on a complaint filed by Directorate of Revenue Intelligence. Anand was accused of making hawala payments to China and evading customs duty of Rs 7 crore on imports.Anand stated he had sent his resignation to the CM's office. However, with Kejriwal in judicial custody, there is no clarity on who will accept it and forward it to the LG. The appointment of a new minister or redistribution of portfolios can only be done by the CM after the LG's approval.The Dalit face in Kejriwal's cabinet, Anand was inducted in Nov 2022 following the resignation of Seemapuri MLA Rajendra Pal Gautam. He was handling seven portfolios, including social welfare, labour, employment, SC/ST welfare and cooperatives. Associated with AAP since the time of the India Against Corruption movement, Anand said he had joined the party on Kejriwal's assertion that politics in country would change. ""Politics didn't change, but politicians have,"" he said.Calling reservation a constitutional compulsion, Anand said AAP ignored the Dalit community when it came to the appointment of people at various places. He claimed that AAP had 13 RS MPs but not even one was a Dalit, a backward or a woman. He said a fellows were appointed in Delhi assembly and were given lakhs of rupees as salaries, but Dalits were ignored.""AAP talks about following principles of Baba Saheb Ambedkar; it hangs Baba Saheb's photos in press conferences and govt offices. But when it comes to following his ideals..."" Anand said.He told reporters that he followed Ambedkar's mantra that one should pay back to society. ""That's why, despite being a businessman, I worked closely with NGOs, joined politics, became an MLA and a minister only to work for the people,"" he said. His wife Veena won from the SC reserved constituency of Patel Nagar in 2013. The duo left party briefly in 2015 but rejoined. Anand fought his first polls from Patel Nagar in 2020 and won.","Social welfare minister and Patel Nagar MLA Raaj Kumar Anand resigned from govt and party Wednesday. Anand, 57, said, ""AAP was formed to fight corruption, but it is now embroiled in it.

Among the highest ranked are JNU , IIT-Bombay and IIT-Madras.In Asia, India is second on list of universities featured (69), behind China (101) and is fourth on ranked subject entries after China, Japan and South Korea. The most represented Indian universities are DU (30 entries), IIT-B (28) and IIT-Kharagpur (27).Mumbai: India is now the world's fourth-largest producer of research, generating 1.3 million academic papers in 2023-24, trailing only behind China (4.5m), US (4.4m), and UK (1.4m), according to the 2024 QS World University Rankings by Subject, compiled by QS Quacquarelli Symonds.The agency offers a detailed analysis of over 16,400 university programmes from 1,500-plus universities in 95 countries. The rankings cover 56 academic disciplines and five faculty areas (arts and humanities, engineering and technology, life sciences, natural sciences and social sciences).India's overall performance showed a notable 17 per centyear-on-year improvement. Jessica Turner, QS CEO, said: ""One of the biggest challenges faced by India is educational - providing high-quality tertiary education in the face of exploding demand: this was recognised by 2020's NEP (National Education Policy), which set the ambitious target of a 50 per centgross enrolment ratio by 2035. It should, therefore, provide some reassurance that the number of Indian programmes featuring across our 55 subject rankings and five broad faculty areas has increased this year - from 355 to 424.""India's highest-ranked university is JNU for development studies (20th globally, a new entry in this discipline); the next two highest ranked universities are IIM-Ahmedabad, debuting in the 22nd position for business and management studies while Saveetha Institute of Medical and Technical Sciences (deemed to be university) secured the 24th spot globally in dentistry and is the only Indian university to achieve perfect score (100/100) in one of the QS indicators, namely the H Index, ranking number one in this metric, within dentistry. Research-wise, India has achieved a 20 per centimprovement in the citations per paper indicator, reflecting research capability. Additionally, there has been 16 per centgrowth in the international research network indicator, which measures volume and diversity of research partnerships. However, there was a slight decrease of 5 per centin the index, which assesses the balance between research productivity and its impact.""India stands as one of the world's most rapidly expanding research centres. From 2017 to 2022, its research output surged by an impressive 54%, based on data from Scopus/Elsevier, QS's bibliometric and research affiliate. This increase not only more than doubles the global average but also significantly exceeds the output of its more traditionally recognised Western peers,"" said QS in its press note. Sowter added, ""Given its current trajectory, India is on the brink of overtaking the United Kingdom in research productivity. However, in terms of research impact, measured by citation count, India ranks ninth globally for the 2017-2022 period. While it is an impressive result, prioritising high-quality, impactful research and its dissemination within the academic community is the essential next step.""","A total of 69 Indian universities have made it to the QS World University Rankings by Subject with 424 entries.

5. Important point for salaried individuals:

(Ammu Sadanandhan, Director, People Advisory Services, EY India contributed to the article)

New versus old tax regime: As the new financial year begins, salaried taxpayers across the nation are gearing up to provide income-tax declarations to their employers. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (ITA) requires employers to deduct tax on the estimated salary income of their employees for the financial year.To facilitate this, employees have to intimate the employers of the tax regime that they intend to opt for along with the details of exemptions and deductions to be claimed, if applicable. In case the option is not declared to the employers, the concessional tax regime (CTR) or the new tax regime will be considered as the default tax regime for withholding taxes from the employees’ salary.Resident individuals with total income up to Rs 5,00,000 are eligible for tax rebate under the regular tax regime. For resident individuals opting for the new tax regime, this limit was increased to Rs 7,00,000 effective financial year 2023-24. This means that if individual taxpayers who are resident in India have total income up to Rs 7,00,000 and opt for CTR, they will not have to pay any income-tax.Also Read | Income Tax Rules FY 2024-25: New vs old tax regime - 6 rules salaried individuals should know Further, to ensure that those resident taxpayers whose income is marginally above the said threshold are not adversely affected, marginal relief was also introduced under the CTR for resident individuals whose net taxable income exceeds Rs 7,00,000 marginally and their incremental income-tax liability is higher than the incremental income above Rs 7,00,000.It is now well-known that individual taxpayers have to forego certain exemptions and deductions to avail the benefits of the lower tax rates available under the new income tax regime. While standard deduction, exemptions for gratuity and leave encashment etc. are available under both tax regimes, there are several other commonly claimed exemptions and deductions that are available only under the regular tax regime such as –In contrast, the deduction for employer’s contribution to the National Pension System is the only deduction under Chapter VI-A available to taxpayers under the new tax regime. Hence, it is one of the essential aspects that individual taxpayers with income above Rs 7,00,000 should keep in mind before choosing the tax regime.As mentioned above, the tax benefit on account of lower tax rates under the new tax regime have to be compared with the tax benefit available due to exemptions and deductions under the regular tax regime with higher tax rates. The tax rates under both the regimes for individual taxpayers are given below:Another aspect that is to be considered by high income taxpayers is the difference in the surcharge rates. Surcharge is levied on the income-tax where the taxable income exceeds Rs 50 lakhs. The surcharge rates under both regimes are as below:The maximum surcharge rate is 37% under the regular tax regime for individuals with taxable income above Rs 5 crores. However, the maximum surcharge rate is capped to 25% under the CTR for taxable income above Rs 2 crores. Hence, it is likely to be beneficial for high-salaried taxpayers to opt for the CTR given the reduction in surcharge rate by 12%.Also Read | New Vs Old Tax Regime: How income of even Rs 10 lakh can be tax-free under old tax regime As one can see from the above, employees with income up to Rs 7,00,000 can opt for CTR as it is beneficial for them. Similarly, salaried individuals with income above Rs 5 Crores may also opt for CTR given the surcharge capping at 25%. However, if they have a significant amount of exemptions and deductions to be claimed, the regular regime may become beneficial.It is the salaried taxpayers who fall between these two categories, who will need to clearly assess their estimated tax liability under both the regimes after taking into account the various exemptions and deductions that they may be eligible to claim vis-à-vis the lower tax rates before submitting the declaration to their employers. Nevertheless, irrespective of the tax regime declared to the employer for tax deduction, the salaried taxpayers (without income from business or profession) have an option to switch tax regimes while filing their income-tax return within the prescribed due date.","Salaried employees have to be cognizant of the following key aspects in choosing the tax regime this financial year. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (ITA) requires employers to deduct tax on the estimated salary income of their employees. Salaried individuals should know that taxpayers whose income is marginally above the said threshold are not adversely affected.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109194353,imgsize-24692,width-400,resizemode-4/109194353.jpg"

""In the Army, tattoos that are not offensive in nature are allowed. If a police officer tattoos his name or any theme he likes, this should not be objected to by seniors.

Whooping cough is surging in China with more than a dozen deaths,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/whooping-cough-is-surging-in-china-with-more-than-a-dozen-deaths/articleshow/109209901.cms,"Vaccination woes

Global issue

Whooping cough is making a post-pandemic comeback in China, with cases surging more than 20-fold in the first two months of 2024.The world’s second-most populous country reported a combined 32,380 cases of pertussis — more commonly known as whooping cough — in January and February, compared with 1,421 cases during the same period in 2023, according to the National Disease Control and Prevention Administration.There were 13 deaths.The number of infections detected in the first 60 days of the year is near the full 2023 total, underscoring the risk of the highly contagious respiratory disease in China. The country endured a major respiratory disease outbreak in 2023 after pulling itself out of the Covid mire in late 2022, well after other nations had thrown open their borders and allowed pathogens to resume their traditional circulation patterns.China provides free vaccines for whooping cough, usually in a combined shot that also protects infants against diphtheria and tetanus. Experts say the vaccine-induced immunity tends to wane as kids reach adolescence. Chinese health authorities don’t mandate or provide booster shots to help shore up immunity.Discussions are needed to determine if the country should update the vaccine it uses for the disease or adjust the immunization program, Shen Hongbing, director of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said at a conference in March.“It requires close attention to prevent and control the spread of whooping cough in China,” Shen said, according to local media reports.Whooping cough infections have been rising in China since 2014, with more than 30,000 in 2019, according to the Chinese CDC. After a respite during the Covid isolation days, they bounced back to almost 40,000 a year in 2022 and 2023, the agency reported.Nuances around vaccination are contributing to the increase. Covid disruptions, waning protection and genetic changes may all be playing a role.Older patients can experience atypical symptoms, leading to misdiagnosis and allowing them to covertly carry and spread the infection. Meanwhile, genetic changes may help the bacteria elude an immune system primed to detect it, allowing the pathogen to continue sickening even the immunized, according to a Beijing Daily report.Vaccination rates worldwide suffered during the pandemic. The percentage of children getting all three doses of the diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis shot plunged to 81% in 2021, the lowest level since 2008, according to the World Health Organization and the United Nations Children’s Fund.The disease caused by the bacterium Bordetella pertussis is transmitted through respiratory droplets. It’s a significant cause of infant death worldwide and continues to be a public health concern despite high vaccination rates, according to the WHO China isn’t alone in its comeback. Whooping cough is endemic and epidemic cycles are occurring every two-to-five years, despite vaccination programs, according to the WHO.Some European countries have posted rising cases since the middle of 2023, according to the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control. The Czech Republic is suffering its biggest outbreak since 1963, and both it and the Netherlands have reported whooping cough-related deaths.","China reports 32,380 cases of pertussis in January and February, compared with 1,421 cases in 2023.

WASHINGTON : A lucky Japanese astronaut will become the first non-American to set foot on the Moon during one of Nasa 's upcoming Artemis missions, US President Joe Biden announced Wednesday.The offer to Japan , an opportunity many nations have long dreamed of, came as part of Prime Minister Fumio Kishida 's state visit, and as Washington seeks to strengthen ties with its key Asian ally.""Two Japanese astronauts will join future American missions, and one will become the first non-American ever to land on the Moon,"" Biden said in a press conference with Kishida.Kishida hailed the announcement as a ""huge achievement"" and announced that Japan would in return supply a rover for the program.Nasa's Artemis program seeks to return humans to the Moon for the first time in over 50 years, and to build a sustained lunar presence ahead of potential missions to Mars.Between 1969 and 1972, the US Apollo program saw 12 Americans, all white men, walk on the Moon.Nasa previously announced that the Artemis program would see the first woman and the first person of color land on the Moon.""America will no longer walk on the Moon alone,"" Nasa chief Bill Nelson said in a video published on social media.""Diplomacy is good for discovery. And discovery is good for diplomacy,"" he added.The first mission to take astronauts to the lunar surface, Artemis 3, is planned for 2026. China meanwhile has said it seeks to put humans on the Moon by 2030.Tokyo and Washington have worked together in the space sector for years, notably collaborating on operations at the International Space Station (ISS).And this year, Japan became the fifth country to succeed in landing a spacecraft on the Moon, with its SLIM craft touching down in January.In a joint media release, the United States and Japan clarified that a Japanese national would land on the Moon ""assuming important benchmarks are achieved,"" without clarifying further.The lunar rover provided by Japan in return will be pressurized, meaning astronauts can travel farther and work for longer periods on the lunar surface, according to the statement.It added that the pressurized rover will accommodate two astronauts in the ""mobile habitat and laboratory"" for up to 30 days as they explore the area near the lunar South Pole.Nasa currently plans to use the rover on the future Artemis 7 mission, followed by subsequent missions over a 10-year lifespan.The European Space Agency (ESA) has three seats reserved for future Artemis missions in exchange for technological contributions to the program.However, it is still unclear whether European astronauts will have the chance to step foot on the Moon or just fly around it.Daniel Neuenschwander, director of human and robotic exploration at the ESA, said these details of the agreement with Nasa were still ""subject to further discussions.""Neuenschwander added in a phone interview with AFP on Wednesday that he could ""perfectly understand"" the cooperation between the United States and Japan, acknowledging ""geostrategic"" motives for the agreement.The Artemis space program was inaugurated in 2022 with Artemis 1, which successfully flew an uncrewed vessel around the Moon.Artemis 2 is planned for 2025 and will send four astronauts around the Moon without landing. The crew will consist of three Americans and a Canadian, who are currently in training.The first crewed landing on the Moon will be Artemis 3, currently scheduled for 2026. Nasa has not yet announced who will take part in the mission.","Japanese astronaut will become the first non-American to set foot on the Moon. Japan will in return supply a rover for the program.

SEOUL: South Korea's opposition was heading towards a landslide victory in Wednesday's parliamentary elections, exit polls indicated, in a major blow to President Yoon Suk Yeol .The outcome, if confirmed, will at the very least leave Yoon as a lame duck for the three remaining years of his term in office.However a super majority that would open the door for the opposition to impeach the president looked out of reach as tallies continued into the early morning Thursday.Yoon's People Power Party (PPP) and its partner party were expected to hang on to over 100 of the National Assembly 's 300 seats, South Korean news agency Yonhap reported, denying the Democratic Party, led by Lee Jae-myung, of the 200 needed for the super majority.Also in play was the new Rebuilding Korea party, led by former justice minister Cho Kuk, which capitalised on discontent with the two main parties to pick up a projected 12-14 seats.""The people have won, the will to judge the Yoon Suk Yeol administration is very clear,"" Cho said after the vote, local media reported.On the campaign trail, he vowed to make Yoon ""first a lame duck, then a dead duck"".""The figures today show the strong anger of people at Yoon for his two-year governance,"" political analyst Yum Seung-yul told AFP.""What if he won't change even with this stunning election outcome? I think there will be even more public anger and that worries me.""Yoon beat Lee in South Korea's closest-ever presidential election in 2022 and has taken a tough line with the nuclear-armed North while improving ties with Washington and former colonial occupier Japan.But Lee, while fending off a slew of graft probes he says are politically motivated, has secured revenge with the election result following a bruising and polarising campaign.""I'll watch the people's choice with a humble heart,"" Lee said after the vote, local media reported.From the start of his presidency, Yoon has been unpopular, with ratings hitting the low 30s, and the PPP's lack of control of the National Assembly stymying his socially conservative legislative agenda.This includes planned healthcare reforms -- that are backed by voters but have sparked a crippling strike by doctors -- and a pledge to abolish the ministry of gender equality.PPP leader Han Dong-hoon said that ""exit polls are disappointing... We will watch the vote count"", the Yonhap reported.On Yoon's side were shifting demographics, with voters aged 60 and older now outnumbering those in both their 20s and 30s in a country with the world's lowest birth rate.Younger Koreans have been put off politics by a political class dominated by older men who ignore their concerns.Many say this was underlined by the horrific 2022 Halloween crowd crush in Seoul that killed more than 150 mostly young people.The younger generation is also struggling economically, with cut-throat competition in education, fewer job opportunities and sky-high housing costs.""There is definitely less interest in this election among the people around me than last time. I think it is because they feel rather disappointed,"" business owner Kim Yong-ho, 24, said outside a polling station in Seoul's Gwangjin district.The tone of the campaigning has also put many voters off, lacking in substantive policy debate and marked instead by shrill calls to ""imprison"" Lee or ""punish"" Yoon.""I am truly ashamed of our country's politics and government,"" Kim Do-kyung, 47, an activist for migrant women and their children, told AFP.This has been accompanied by hate speech and disinformation online that experts worry could lead to more attacks like the one on Lee in January and another weeks later.The DP favours a less hawkish approach towards Pyongyang, and Lee has made a number of pro-China remarks. One doctored video showed him bowing to a statue of Mao Zedong.It has also latched onto a gaffe by Yoon last month about the ""reasonable"" cost of green onions, a staple in Korean cooking that has soared in price.The humble vegetable became a popular prop at DP rallies, and the election commission even banned voters from bringing them to polling stations.Official results are expected later Thursday.","South Korea's opposition was heading towards a landslide victory in Wednesday's parliamentary elections, exit polls indicated.

The list of co-accused includes former central bankers, ex-government officials and previous SCB executives.The charges they face include bribery, abuse of power, appropriation and violations of banking law.Lan has denied the charges and blamed subordinates.Prosecutors have called for Lan to face the death sentence, an unusually severe punishment in such a case.She and the 85 others were arrested as part of a national corruption crackdown that has swept up many officials and members of Vietnam's business elite in recent years.Lan appeared to say in final remarks to the court last week that she had thoughts of suicide.""In my desperation, I thought of death,"" she said, according to state media.""I am so angry that I was stupid enough to get involved in this very fierce business environment -- the banking sector -- which I have little knowledge of.""- Heavy police presence -Hundreds of people began to stage protests in the capital Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, a relatively rare occurrence in the one-party communist state, after Lan's arrest in October 2022.There was a heavy police presence outside the State Bank of Vietnam in Hanoi on Wednesday, a site of previous demonstrations.Police have identified around 42,000 victims of the scandal, which has shocked the Southeast Asian country.Lan, who is married to a wealthy Hong Kong businessman also on trial, is accused of setting up fake loan applications to withdraw money from SCB, in which she owned a 90 percent stake.Police say those caught up in the scam are all SCB bondholders who cannot withdraw their money and have not received interest or principal payments since Lan's arrest.The value of Lan's alleged asset appropriation, which occurred between 2012 and 2022, was equivalent to around three percent of Vietnam's GDP in 2022.Prosecutors said during the trial they had seized more than 1,000 properties belonging to Lan.Authorities have also said $5.2 million allegedly given by Lan and some SCB bankers to state officials to conceal the bank's violations and poor financial situation was the largest bribe recorded in Vietnam.The woman who was offered the bribe -- Do Thi Nhan, the former head of the State Bank of Vietnam's inspection team -- said during the trial the cash was handed to her in Styrofoam boxes by the former CEO of SCB, Vo Tan Van.After realising they contained money, Nhan refused the boxes but Van declined to take them back, state media reported.More than 4,400 people have been indicted during Vietnam's corruption crackdown, across more than 1,700 graft cases, since 2021.A top Vietnamese luxury property tycoon -- Do Anh Dung, head of the Tan Hoang Minh group -- was sentenced to eight years in prison last month after he was found guilty of cheating thousands of investors in a $355 million bond scam.","Truong My Lan, chair of major developer Van Thinh Phat, is accused of swindling cash.

The engineer, Sam Salehpour , who worked on the plane, detailed his allegations in interviews with NYT and in documents sent to FAA.Salehpour, who has worked at Boeing for over a decade, said the problems stemmed from changes in how the enormous sections were fitted and fastened together in the assembly line. The plane's fuselage comes in several pieces, all from different manufacturers, and they are not exactly the same shape where they fit together, he said. Salehpour observed shortcuts used to reduce bottlenecks during 787 assembly process that placed ""excessive stress on major airplane joints, and embedded drilling debris between key joints on more than 1,000 planes"", his lawyers said.Boeing said it was ""fully confident in 787 Dreamliner"", adding that ""these claims about structural integrity of the 787 are inaccurate and do not represent the comprehensive work Boeing has done to ensure the quality and long-term safety of the aircraft.""Salehpour's allegations add another element to the intense scrutiny that Boeing has been facing since a door panel blew off a 737 Max jet during an Alaska Airlines flight in early Jan, raising questions about the company's manufacturing practices . Since then, the plane-maker has announced a leadership overhaul, and the justice department has begun a criminal investigation.Salehpour's concerns are set to receive an airing on Capitol Hill. US Senate's homeland security and governmental affairs committee's investigations subcommittee is planning to hold a hearing with Salehpour on April 17.The Dreamliner is a wide-body jet that is more fuel efficient than many other aircraft used for long trips, in part because of its lightweight composite construction. First delivered in 2011, the twin-aisle plane has both racked up orders for Boeing and created headaches for the company. For years, the plane-maker has dealt with a succession of issues involving the jet, including battery problems that led to the temporary grounding of 787s around the world and quality concerns that more recently caused an extended halt in deliveries.Boeing has also confronted a slew of problems at its plant in South Carolina where the Dreamliner is built. A prominent Boeing whistleblower who raised concerns about manufacturing practices at the plant, John Barnett, was found dead last month with what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound.","US Federal Aviation Administration is investigating claims made by a Boeing engineer who says that sections of the fuselage of the 787 Dreamliner are improperly fastened together.

Interoperability with allies:

NEW DELHI: Japan has marked a significant milestone in its military modernization by transforming the warship Kaga into the nation's first full aircraft carrier since World War II. The Kaga, previously serving as a helicopter carrier , has undergone upgrades to deploy the F-35 Lightning II stealth fighter, heralding a new era in Japan's defense capabilities amidst increasing regional tensions.The unveiling of the upgraded Kaga at the Kure naval base in Hiroshima signifies Japan's efforts to enhance its maritime strength. Robert Dujarric, co-director of the Institute of Contemporary Asian Studies at Temple University's Tokyo campus, emphasized that while the Kaga alone may not drastically alter Japan's military dynamics, the sophisticated aircraft it carries bolsters its operational capabilities. ""The broader advantage it will provide is the greater ability to operate and interact with US and other forces in the region, giving Japan some of the same toys as the big boys,"" Dujarric noted.As per a South China Morning Post report, originally launched in 2015 as part of the Izumo class, the largest warships built by Japan since WWII , the Kaga has been refitted at a cost of 115 billion yen (US$758 million) to accommodate Lockheed Martin F-35B fighters. This marks a shift from its initial capacity of carrying up to eight helicopters. The retrofit includes a redesigned bow section and a new heat-resistant deck coating to withstand the F-35B's engine heat during vertical take-offs and landings.The operational concept of deploying the Kaga as an aircraft carrier remains under discussion. Ryo Hinata-Yamaguchi, an assistant professor of international relations at the University of Tokyo, pointed out the logistical nuances, given that the F-35Bs, operated by the Air Self-Defence Force, will not be permanently stationed on the Kaga. The carrier's strategic use, whether for controlling sea areas or supporting amphibious units, is yet to be fully articulated.Despite its advanced capabilities, analysts remain skeptical about the Kaga's ability to significantly impact the regional power balance, especially in the face of China's expanding aircraft carrier fleet. Hinata-Yamaguchi suggested that while the refitted carrier might pose an obstacle to potential territorial ambitions in the South China Sea or the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands, it is unlikely to be perceived as a substantial threat by China.The introduction of the Kaga, along with its sister ship Izumo, into active service underscores Japan's commitment to reinforcing its maritime defense and enhancing interoperability with allies.The F-35 Lightning II, especially in its vertical take-off variant deployed on the newly upgraded Kaga aircraft carrier, significantly enhances Japan's defense capabilities through several key advancements:The F-35 is renowned for its stealth capabilities, making it difficult for enemy radars to detect. This allows Japan to conduct surveillance and strikes with a reduced risk of detection by adversaries, providing a strategic advantage in maintaining airspace superiority.Equipped with state-of-the-art avionics and sensor systems, the F-35 can gather and share critical intelligence in real-time. This capability ensures Japan's Self-Defense Forces have access to comprehensive battlefield awareness, facilitating informed decision-making and strategic planning.The F-35B variant's VTOL capability enables operations from a variety of platforms, including the Kaga, without the need for traditional runways. This flexibility allows for rapid deployment and repositioning of airpower in response to threats, enhancing Japan's ability to protect its maritime interests and defend its territory.The F-35's integration into Japan's military furthers interoperability with key allies, notably the United States, who also operate the F-35. This commonality allows for seamless joint operations and strengthens collective defense capabilities in the region.","Japan has transformed the warship Kaga into the nation's first full aircraft carrier since World War II.

Those surveys took place weeks after a controversial documentary on Narendra Modi and the 2002 Gujarat riots was aired by BBC in UK, which got banned in India. The Indian govt denies the surveys and the documentary are connected.The BBC has applied for a stake of just under 26% in the new Indian company. This is a first for the broadcaster’s global operations.Collective Newsroom is wholly owned by Indian citizens, with four former BBC India staff, Rupa Jha, Mukesh Sharma, Sanjoy Majumder and Sara Hassan, leaving the BBC to lead Collective Newsroom.

An appeals court judge Wednesday swiftly rejected the latest salvo from the former president's lawyers, who argued he should be on the campaign trail rather than ""in a courtroom defending himself"" starting next week.Trump's lawyers had asked the state's mid-level appeals court to halt the case indefinitely while they fight to remove the trial judge and challenge several of his pretrial rulings, which they argue have seriously hindered the presumptive Republican nominee's defense.Justice Ellen Gesmer's ruling, after a third straight day of emergency hearings on Trump's delay requests, was yet another loss for Trump, who has tried repeatedly to get the trial postponed. Barring further court action, the ruling clears the way for jury selection to begin next Monday.""We're here for this stay because there are restrictions in place that cannot operate in a constitutional way in a trial environment,"" Trump lawyer Emil Bove argued at the hearing, which was held in a court basement lobby because the regular courtroom was in use.""It's an incredibly important trial. It's a historic, unprecedented proceeding,"" Bove said, adding: ""This can only be done once and it must be done right.""Trump's hush-money case is the first of his four criminal indictments slated to go to trial and would be the first criminal trial ever of a former president.Adding to a litany of complaints registered this week with the appeals court, Bove argued that trial Judge Juan Merchan""exceeded his authority"" in refusing to postpone the case until the Supreme Court rules on an immunity claim Trump raised in another of his criminal cases. Trump's lawyers argue some evidence in the hush-money case could be excluded if the Supreme Court rules in his favor.Merchan last week declared that request untimely, ruling that Trump's lawyers had ""myriad opportunities"" to raise the immunity issue before they finally did so in March, well after a deadline for pretrial motions had passed.Steven Wu, the appellate chief for the Manhattan district attorney's office, echoed that sentiment at Wednesday's emergency hearing. He argued that Trump's lawyers had months to raise immunity and other issues and should not be rewarded with a delay at the eleventh hour.""Staying the trial at this point would be incredibly disruptive,"" Wu said. ""The court, the people, witnesses have made extraordinary efforts to make sure this trial can take place on Monday.""""There's a powerful public interest to ensure this criminal trial goes forward,"" he added.Gesmer presided over the emergency hearing from an armchair, facing a hodgepodge of wooden seats, a collapsable table and a restroom.Trump is accused of falsifying his company's records to hide the nature of payments to his former lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen, who helped Trump bury negative stories during his 2016 campaign. Cohen's activities included paying porn actor Stormy Daniels $130,000 to suppress her claims of an extramarital sexual encounter with Trump years earlier.Trump pleaded not guilty last year to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. He has denied having a sexual encounter with Daniels. His lawyers argue the payments to Cohen were legitimate legal expenses.Trump already struck out twice this week with the appeals court. One appeals court judge Monday rejected his bid to delay the trial while he seeks to move it out of Manhattan. A different judge on Tuesday denied a request, framed as part of a lawsuit against Merchan, that the trial be delayed while Trump fights a gag order imposed on him in recent weeks.Trump's lawyers had asked Merchan last month to adjourn the New York trial indefinitely until Trump's immunity claim in his Washington, D.C., election interference case is resolved.Trump contends he is immune from prosecution for conduct alleged to involve official acts during his tenure in office. His lawyers have not raised that as a defense in the hush-money case, but they argued that some evidence - including Trump's social media posts about former lawyer Cohen - is from his time as president and should be excluded from the trial because of his immunity protections.The Supreme Court is to hear arguments in that matter on April 25.""This is a situation where a judge has exceeded his authority under circumstances with very, very serious federalism implications,"" Bove argued at Wednesday's emergency hearing.Trump's lawyers also renewed their argument that Merchan should step aside from the case. They've accused him of bias and a conflict of interest, citing his daughter's work as the head of a firm whose clients have included President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and other Democrats.Trump's lawyers filed a formal recusal request with Merchan last week. The judge rejected a similar request in August and has not ruled on Trump's pending request. The judge has also yet to rule on another defense delay request , which claims that Trump won't get a fair trial because of ""prejudicial media coverage.""""Their recusal arguments are completely meritless,"" Wu argued.Trump's lawyers also took issue with a protocol Merchan put in place last month to manage a flood of last-minute court filings. And, they revisited their complaints - aired at an emergency hearing Tuesday - about the gag order Merchan imposed on Trump last month that bars him from making public comments about witnesses, jurors and others regarding their connections to the case.Trump's ability to campaign ""is something that's protected under the First Amendment, for President Trump and the American people,"" Bove argued.","Donald Trump is 0 for 3 in last-minute attempts to get a New York appeals court to delay his looming hush money criminal trial. An appeals court judge Wednesday swiftly rejected the latest salvo from the former president's lawyers. Barring further court action, the ruling clears the way for jury selection to begin next Monday.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109209367,imgsize-1519237,width-400,resizemode-4/109209367.jpg"

Donald Trump no longer on Bloomberg Billionaires Index,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-no-longer-on-bloomberg-billionaires-index/articleshow/109183522.cms,"NEW DELHI: Trump Media, the parent company behind former President Donald Trump 's social media platform Truth Social , has experienced a significant decline in stock prices, consequently impacting Trump's ranking on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index . The index, which daily ranks the world's 500 richest people, no longer lists Trump following a notable nosedive in Trump Media 's stock price.The company's shares fell 12% on Friday and an additional 8% on Monday, with a further decline of 4.8% on Tuesday before making a slight recovery to close at $37.47, marking an 0.8% increase for the day. However, this was still a more than 50% decrease from its peak in late March. This drastic drop in value occurred after Trump Media merged with Digital World Acquisition Corp, initiating trading under the ticker DJT on March 26, a USA Today report said.This downturn has erased billions from the company’s market valuation , which stood at nearly $8 billion following its market debut. Trump, who owns approximately 60% of Trump Media, equating to 78.75 million shares, saw his stake's value soar to as much as $6 billion post-IPO, briefly earning him a spot on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.As of the latest evaluations, Trump's stake is estimated at closer to $3 billion, significantly affecting his net worth which Forbes pegged at $4.8 billion on Tuesday afternoon, ranking him as the 653rd richest person globally. This estimation falls below the Bloomberg Index's minimum net worth requirement for listing, which was $5.81 billion as of Tuesday.Trump Media's stock has been marked by volatility since its inception, reflecting major fluctuations in Trump's net worth. Despite the company's valuation standing at $5 billion recently, it contrasts starkly with its financial performance in 2023, reporting a loss of over $58 million against a revenue of $4 million.Critics argue that the company is overvalued compared to other social media entities, attributing its inflated value to investments by Trump supporters. An audit firm previously cautioned that Trump Media’s significant operating losses cast doubt on its sustainability. Nevertheless, Trump has vocally defended the company on Truth Social, asserting its solidity and rapid growth, and expressing his confidence in its effectiveness and promising future.(With inputs from agencies)","Trump Media, the parent company behind former President Donald Trump's social media platform Truth Social, has experienced a significant decline in stock prices.

Pakistan: People in Karachi continue to face acute water shortages amid Eid ul-Fitr celebrations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-people-in-karachi-continue-to-face-acute-water-shortages-amid-eid-ul-fitr-celebrations/articleshow/109201598.cms,"KARACHI: As residents continue to face acute water shortages in many parts of Karachi on the eve of Eid ul-Fitr , there is no sign of relief from the problem even during the three days of the festival, with water supply being suspended through water bowsers for the next two days, Pakistan-based Dawn reported.The most-affected areas will be the salubrious parts of Karachi, including the Defence Housing Authority and Clifton, where residents mainly depend on the supply of potable water through water bowsers, according to Dawn report.People from almost every part of Karachi have complained that the Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation (KWSC) increased their miseries during Ramazan as they faced acute water shortages in their respective areas. However, a spokesman for the water utility said that the KWSC had made special arrangements for the water supply and drainage of water in Karachi before and during Eid.He said that water supply was impacted in some parts of Karachi due to mechanical activities. He further said that the supply had to be suspended for repair and maintenance work that caused water scarcity in some parts of Karachi.Speaking to Dawn, KWSC chief executive officer Syed Salahuddin Ahmed said that all pumping stations in the city were operating normally and 520 million gallons of water per day was being supplied to the city from the Dhabeji Pumping Station.He said, ""The demand of water has increased with the hot weather."" Ahmed announced that effective steps for the supply and drainage of water will be taken around Eid gatherings, mosques and schools in Karachi.Rejecting the KWSC official's claims, the residents said that water had not flowed through the main pipelines for the past several days in their areas, forcing them to opt for the mushrooming water tanker mafia to meet their daily requirements.Tauseef Shah, resident of Gulshan-i-Iqbal Block 13, said that the 2,000-gallon water tanker that they used to purchase for Pakistani rupees (PKR) 2,000 was now being sold at PKR 5,000 to 6,000 in his area.He said, ""It happens on every Eid,"" adding that the tanker mafia, with the involvement of water utility officials, minted millions of rupees each year during religious festivals,"" Dawn reported.The water shortage that continued to affect residents in district central alleged that the water meant for the district was being supplied to other regions of Karachi, according to Dawn report. They stated that the Sakhi Hasan Hydrant was closed for the past three days due to a shortage of water, forcing the people to make alternative arrangements for water supply.The Sakhi Hasan Hydrant was made operational only for eight hours to supply water in the district, Dawn reported, citing sources. Meanwhile, the water utility said that the supply of water through tankers from seven official hydrants will remain suspended on Wednesday and Thursday as the tanker drivers will not come to duty due to Eid celebrations.Hydrant cell incharge Elahi Bux Bhutto said that there were 2,800 registered water tankers supplying 12 to 15 MGD water to various parts of Karachi. He said that the water tanker service remained closed on the first two days of Eid as drivers remained on holidays."," Karachi residents continue to face acute water shortages on eve of Eid ul-Fitr.

Muhammad Aurangzeb: From JPMorgan to Pakistan’s finance minister with no pay,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/muhammad-aurangzeb-from-jpmorgan-to-pakistans-finance-minister-with-no-pay/articleshow/109147941.cms,"Seats of power

Fresh face

Pakistan’s new finance minister is on a mission to fix his country. To many, it’s an unenviable task.Muhammad Aurangzeb took up the post last month at a time when Pakistan’s economy is enduring the most turbulent period in its history.Lurching from one bailout program to the next with the International Monetary Fund classifying its debt as only borderline sustainable, Pakistan has Asia’s fastest inflation, anemic growth, and one of the lowest tax-collection rates in the world.As a prominent banker and JPMorgan Chase & Co alumnus, Aurangzeb comes as well equipped as any of his predecessors to face the challenge. But that’s to disregard an array of extra factors affecting the role which are outside his control, including volatile domestic politics, tensions with neighbors India, Afghanistan and Iran, and a catastrophic position on the front line of climate change.“Broadly, the finance minister’s job is to manage and steer the economy,” said Mosharraf Zaidi, a former government adviser and founder of policy think tank Tabadlab based in Pakistan’s capital, Islamabad. “It seems simple when framed this way. In fact, it is one of the most complex jobs on the planet.”Among the most immediate of his tasks is to seal a deal by June with the IMF for a minimum three year program worth at least $6 billion. Key objectives in the negotiations for the fund will include broadening the tax base, improving debt sustainability and restoring viability to the energy sector — all steps that Pakistan has avoided for decades.Aurangzeb cites a shared sense of urgency with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, who was elected to a second successive term in March. “He’s a person who wants to get things done,” he said of Sharif in an interview in his ministry in Islamabad.“This is the time to actually capitalize on that mandate and ensure that all the tough decisions that need to be taken are taken now,” said Aurangzeb. The alternative would be “a huge missed opportunity that we can ill afford.”“We should consult with everyone, we should try to build a consensus, but a few things we’ll just have to bite the bullet and do it,” he said.Hailing from a prominent family in Lahore — his father was Pakistan’s attorney general — Aurangzeb, 59, went to the nation’s elite Aitchison College then studied at Wharton on a scholarship before working at Citigroup Inc. in New York early in his career.He returned to Pakistan to work at a unit of ABN Amro Bank NV, later shifting to the bank’s headquarters in Amsterdam. In 2018, he again accepted a move back to his home country when he left JPMorgan in Singapore to take over as chief executive officer of Pakistan’s largest lender, Habib Bank Ltd, just after it had been fined $225 million and forced to end its US operations for weak anti-money-laundering controls and sanctions compliance.At the time, his return to Pakistan surprised those he worked with, since he was seen to be leaving the comfort of Singapore and a cushy role at JPMorgan for a post that few considered a dream job, according to a former colleague.Aurangzeb would often speak about his love for the country of his birth and the elevation to finance minister is seen as evidence of his commitment to the nation, the person said, asking not to be named discussing personal decisions.Married with two adult children, Aurangzeb — also known as Auri — was a member of the prime minister’s economic advisory council in 2022 during Sharif’s previous term, a role that gave him an inside view of the premier’s management style. He was tapped for the finance post a few weeks before the election, flying from his base in the commercial capital Karachi to meet with Sharif multiple times before accepting the offer.“It’s a huge privilege,” he said. “But then it comes with a set of expectations.”His ministry sits close to the Margalla hills that bound the capital to the north, a 20 minute walk from the prime minister’s office, with the national assembly midway between the two seats of government power. A recent introduction to his office is a large television with split screens showing stock market prices, economic indicators, and Bloomberg TV.Aurangzeb was one of the highest paid corporate leaders in Pakistan before joining the government. Now, in line with other cabinet members, he’s not drawing a salary. He also renounced his Dutch citizenship to become eligible for the post.What he describes as “national service” will mean reaching tough decisions under the toughest IMF program in years if he and Sharif are to bring the economy back from the brink. These include putting a stop to accumulating more state losses by raising energy prices and selling state-owned companies, unpopular choices that will inevitably trigger pushback from powerful business lobbies and stoke public anger — a chief reason they’ve been avoided to date.Aurangzeb will approach the challenge as a political outsider. He is not part of Sharif’s political party, and was appointed in a technocratic capacity. Sharif leads a shaky coalition whose two main allies have said they will support the government on a case-by-case basis only.There have already been attempts to contain Aurangzeb’s role. Sharif decided to chair the Economic Coordination Committee, a top policy-making forum that is usually headed by the finance minister, before backtracking a day later after public criticism.Foreign minister Ishaq Dar — a veteran politician who served four separate stints as finance minister until he was shunted sideways by Sharif — has been installed as head of a privatization committee that would normally have been led by Aurangzeb or the minister for privatization.With ministers routinely swapped out and back in again, his is the first fresh face at the finance ministry in six years. Finance ministers are regularly blamed for Pakistan’s economic woes, and there have been more than 10 in the past decade; Sharif had two in his previous 16-month tenure.Aurangzeb is clear that his key challenge is the economy and not politics. For all his corporate experience, he says he’s focused on Pakistan’s future rather than dwelling on his past achievements.“You have to push yourself,” he said. “You have to get out of your comfort zone.”","Muhammad Aurangzeb took up the post last month at a time when Pakistan’s economy is enduring the most turbulent period in its history.
