"S Jaishankar’s clear message on investments from China: ‘India can’t, in the name of open economy…’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/s-jaishankars-clear-message-on-investments-from-china-india-cant-in-the-name-of-open-economy/articleshow/109881194.cms,"External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar has sent out a clear message on the issue of investments from China , stating that India as a country can’t compromise its national and economic security in the name of opening up the economy. Jaishankar said that India is well within its rights to safeguard the interests of its manufacturers, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), as well as the labor force and working classes.“Every country today has the right to manage sensitive sectors in consonance with national security.I cannot, in the name of open economy, open up my national security to work with a country which is laying claim on my territory. Both our economic and national security are at stake,” Jaishankar told ET in an interview.Jaishankar was asked about PM Narendra Modi’s recent remarks on ties with China and whether one can expect nuanced shift post-elections that will allow for more investments. He noted that in a recent interview with Newsweek, the prime minister characterized the current state of relations with China as abnormal, emphasizing the need for normalcy, which can only be achieved through peace and tranquility along the border.This stance aligns with our consistent policy, and there appears to be no compelling reason to deviate from it. After all, without peace and tranquility on the border, it is challenging to maintain functional relations with any neighboring country, Jaishankar said.Also Read | ‘Never before in Indian history…’: Economist Surjit Bhalla says unprecedented number of jobs created under Modi government On the economic issue, he said, “I get a lot of lectures about why are you being protectionist in this globalised world? But I will take whatever defensive measures I have to in the interest of the working class whose jobs are at stake. People who give this lecture are not connected with the real economy, society.” “As someone who spends a lot of time with SMEs, who has lived in Noida for most of my life, I can tell you how strong that sense of resentment is today about dumping of goods from China. We will do what it takes,” he added.Commenting on Apple sourcing its components from China, Jaishankar said that Apple's performance has been remarkable, and they are thriving in the current market. “I assure you that whether it was Apple or anybody else in a similar situation, we're not impractical people. Don't get me wrong. We want to see global companies come to India. If global companies have prior vendors and supply chains, we are not impervious. Nobody has said that Chinese companies cannot come to India,” he said.Also Read | Sanjeev Sanyal's UPSC reality check: Dream to be Elon Musk, or Mukesh Ambani, why a Joint Secretary? “On the contrary, we only said we will examine, scrutinise, try to understand who is coming here for what.

"IT majors Cognizant, Capgemini hired 1.5 lakh less employees in 2023; here's why",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/it-majors-cognizant-capgemini-hired-1-5-lakh-less-employees-in-2023-heres-why/articleshow/109875494.cms,"IT Sector Hiring Trends

IT sector hiring : The total number of employees hired by the major IT companies Cognizant and Capgemini decreased globally by 151,607 in 2023 compared to 2022, according to their regulatory filings. Both companies have most of their employees located in India. Together, they hire approximately 400,000 individuals in this country.According to an ET report, in 2022, Cognizant, based in the US, hired 132,000 employees, while the French IT consultancy firm Capgemini recruited a total of 140,789 employees, not including those hired through acquisitions.However, in 2023, the number of employees hired by Cognizant dropped to slightly over 60,000, whereas Capgemini recruited approximately 61,182 individuals. To put it differently, there was a decrease of 72,000 in the hiring numbers at Cognizant and 79,607 at Capgemini compared to the previous year.Top Indian IT service providers such as Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys, and Wipro have also experienced a decrease in their workforce, which decreased by approximately 70,000 in total in the fiscal year that ended on March 31.Peter Bendor-Samuel, who is the chief executive of consultancy firm Everest Group, was quoted as saying that these service providers hired more employees than needed during the Covid pandemic to compensate for the high attrition rate and in anticipation of the industry's high growth rate to persist. However, the industry has shrunk, leading to an excess supply of talent in these companies.Due to macroeconomic uncertainty, the lack of natural attrition did not assist them, leading the companies to significantly decrease the intake of new talent. Although Indian IT service providers avoid discussing layoffs, Cognizant began a program in the second quarter of 2023 to simplify its operating model, optimize corporate functions, and consolidate and realign office space to adapt to the post-pandemic hybrid work environment.During 2023, Cognizant faced $115 million in employee separation expenses and $114 million in costs related to facility exits and other expenses, amounting to a total of $229 million.Also Read | Apple ecosystem becomes biggest blue-collar job creator in India! 1.5 lakh direct jobs created since PLI scheme “Another factor which is also contributing to the firms’ hesitancy to hire is the belief that Gen AI will reduce the need to hire L1s (in level 1) or freshers,” Samuel added.The number of employees at Cognizant decreased by 7,100 in the March quarter of FY24 to 344,400 from the previous year. Approximately 250,000 of its employees work in India. The total number of employees at the Capgemini Group decreased to 337,200 as of March 31, 2024, which is 6% lower than the previous year. The offshore workforce accounted for 57%, or 192,000 employees, of the total headcount, a decrease from 58%, or 207,300 employees, in March of the previous year. Indians made up approximately 66% of Capgemini's total headcount as of December 31, 2023.Also Read | ‘Never before in Indian history…’: Economist Surjit Bhalla says unprecedented number of jobs created under Modi government Pareekh Jain, the Chief Executive Officer of EIIRTrend, highlighted two factors contributing to the decline in hiring numbers. “There is an overall tech spend slowdown, and IT firms are relying on inorganic growth rather than on their organic growth. This is the reason why there are more acquisitions happening at a time when hiring is very slow. They are reluctant to hire and train.”Jain added, “The second factor is that in these times of AI and GenAI, companies are also finding it difficult to get the right talent and skills for such requirements. Market has no matching supply for these skills.”","The total number of employees hired by the major IT companies Cognizant and Capgemini decreased globally by 151,607 in 2023 compared to 2022.

However, iPhone revenues experienced a decline, dropping to $45.96 billion from $51.33 billion in the quarter ending in March.The decrease in iPhone sales was attributed to a sales decline in Apple's Greater China region, which encompasses Mainland China, Taiwan, Singapore, and Hong Kong.

He highlighted the large and growing populations in these regions and the high level of excitement for the Apple brand.""We are happy because these are markets where our market share is low, the populations are large and growing, and our products are really making a lot of progress in those markets. The level of excitement for the brand is very high,"" Maestri said.Looking ahead to the June quarter, Apple provided guidance for single-digit growth.

He has pointed out that the period between 2004 and 2013, under the UPA government, saw the least number of jobs created, leading to the coining of the term 'jobless growth'.""The job creation by the Modi government has been the highest on record.""Never before in Indian history have so many jobs been created on an average basis. Something close to 10 million jobs over the last 7-8 years,"" he told PTI.Bhalla, who previously served on the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister (EAC-PM), is of the view that the highest number of jobs were generated during the tenures of Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Modi.Also Read | Sanjeev Sanyal's UPSC reality check: Dream to be Elon Musk, or Mukesh Ambani, why a Joint Secretary? Bhalla's comments were in response to a recent International Labour Organization (ILO) report, which indicated that in 2022, nearly 83 per cent of India's total unemployed population consisted of unemployed youths.However, he clarified, ""If you look at the data of youth after the age of 29, the unemployment rate in India, which is the most of the population, most of the workforce has been somewhere around 1 per cent, which is really not much of an unemployment rate at all."" He further said that the youth are primarily seeking better job opportunities.Bhalla pointed out that frictional unemployment is higher among the youth worldwide.He also commented on the decrease in foreign direct investment (FDI) in India, attributing it to the government's new policy that requires investment disputes to be settled within the country. ""Now, if I am a foreign investor, why should I take that risk?

Several countries, including the US, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Poland, and Germany, have witnessed significant gains in the global share following this decline in FDI flows to China.Based on statistical possibility, Bhalla predicted that the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is likely to secure between 330-350 seats on its own in the ongoing Lok Sabha polls.

Tata motors Punches at Maruti's best-seller,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tata-motors-punches-at-marutis-best-seller/articleshow/109898850.cms,"New Delhi: The most popular car of the country is not a Maruti any more, but a Tata. In one of the biggest reversals in Indian car industry, Tata's 'mini SUV ' Punch has emerged as the country's largest-selling model, ahead of some of Maruti's popular models like WagonR , Swift, and Brezza.The feat was first achieved in March 2024 where Punch was ahead on total sales of 17,547 units against 16,368 units by WagonR, which was third.In March, the surprise number two was Hyundai's SUV Creta that accounted for 16,458 units, according to numbers sourced from industry analysts.Punch repeated the feat in April as well with 19,158 units against 17,850 units of WagonR. Maruti's Brezza SUV was the third-largest seller in the month at 17,113 units. This perhaps is one of the rare instances where a Maruti model has not been the biggest-seller in the country. And, the fact that Punch holding on to leadership position for two straight months shows that the trend can be sustained.The numbers display changing dynamics in Indian car industry and brings out turnaround scripted by Tata Motors over past few years where it moved up to emerge as the country's third largest-selling car company behind Maruti and Hyundai. Models such as Punch, Nexon, Tiago and Altroz have fuelled the comeback.There had been months in FY24 where Tata pipped Hyundai to second position and many predict the company may emerge as the second-largest seller, considering the pace at which it is launching cars and its dominance in electric vehicle space.Punch has petrol, CNG and electric versions and its price starts from Rs 6.1 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi) for petrol versions and above Rs 11 lakh for electric.However, Maruti still dominates Indian market. This is evident from the fact that in March, six out of top 10 most-selling models were from Maruti and this number was seven in April. Maruti continues to see strong traction in the retail market as it adjusts production of models in line with waiting periods for individual cars, which impacts sales of certain vehicles, say analysts.Tata, however, is on a high, and the confidence is only growing as its models get higher acceptance in market. The company has been adding electrics to existing models, while also looking at driving in 'born electric' or pureplay green cars.","Punch has petrol, CNG and electric versions and its price starts from Rs 6.1 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi) Maruti still dominates Indian market.

Tax collection at source:

Extension of Faceless Scheme time limit:

The finance minister set the stage for a ""Viksit Bharat by 2047"", on the core principles of ‘Sabka Saath’, ‘Sabka Vikas’, ‘Sabka Vishwas’, with ‘Sabka Prayas’ being added as a new theme in the interim Budget.This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data i.e., farmer welfare and N for Nari utthan i.e., support for women entrepreneurs.These form the pillars of a comprehensive inclusive development. The Government's commitment to sustainable development under the strategy for Amrit Kaal includes achieving 'Net Zero' by 2070, rooftop solarization for one crore households and robust health initiatives.The Indian economy's resilience takes center stage amidst positive indicators of declining current account deficit as a percentage of GDP, falling unemployment rates, and a notable rise in digital transactions. These statistics affirm the robustness of the economy, showcasing a trajectory of growth and stability.The achievements in taxation reforms are nothing short of remarkable, with direct tax collections more than trebling in the last decade, the number of tax return filers increasing by 2.4 times, average processing time of tax returns plummeting from 93 days in FY 2013-14 to an impressive 10 days in FY 2023-24, resulting in issuance of quick refunds. These are the results of consistent progressive measures thus obviating the need for, and rightly avoiding, any last-minute populist measures.No change in existing tax rates, both for direct and indirect taxes, is a good indicator of stability and predictability for investors and taxpayers.A welcome move to waive outstanding tax demands that are minor, disputed, and unreconciled. This involves the withdrawal of outstanding direct tax demands up to Rs. 25,000 pertaining to the period up to FY 2009-10 and up to Rs.10,000 for FY 2010-11 to 2014-15.The Government's commitment to fostering a business-friendly environment is evident in its intent to extend specific tax benefits for start-ups, investments by sovereign wealth funds/ pension funds, and certain IFSC units. The extension has been made now until March 31, 2025. This might help in creating a conducive landscape for business.To align with the CBDT notification issued earlier, the provisions relating to tax collection at source concerning remittances under the Liberalized Remittance Scheme have now been formally incorporated in the Finance Bill, 2024, setting the rate at 20% for amounts exceeding Rs. 7 lakhs in a financial year.The Finance Bill, 2024 proposes an extension of the time limit for introducing the faceless scheme by the Central Government for transfer pricing proceedings, DRP Proceedings, and ITAT Proceedings, up to March 31, 2025.The interim Budget 2024 may not have proposed significant tax announcements, but it very well positioned the prelude to the full budget post the upcoming elections. Considering the potential impact on the population across the four pillars of GYAN, a sizable portion of India stands to be covered.

Interim Budget for a Viksit Bharat: It’s for everyone and all,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/interim-budget-for-a-viksit-bharat-its-for-everyone-and-all/articleshow/107497439.cms,"By Akhilesh Tuteja

The Finance Minister on February 01, 2024, delivered a truly innovative interim budget. At first glance, it did not seem like an interim budget but looked more like the budget to drive further growth and a continuum of inclusive growth-oriented investments.At the outset, this budget brings a wonderful balance between fiscal prudence and continued investment for growth.It's not easy to continue the glide path of reducing the fiscal deficit and continuing to make significant investments in all areas including infrastructure, R&D, energy transition, technology, skilling, and social welfare. The surprising reduction in fiscal deficit of 5.8% as against the budgeted 5.9% for FY24 and the projection of 5.1% in FY25 with a clear focus on increasing investments was a huge positive.This was a budget for everyone and all because it caters to every part of the Indian economy and society. The FM has carefully catered to the investment needs of various sectors. The continued focus on youth, impoverished, women and farmers to increase their involvement and contribution to economic growth is evident. By committing an 11.1% increase in capital expenditure to 11,11,111 lakh crore, the FM has clearly brought every single 1 in this growth journey.What was very impressive was the inclusion strategy of the government. The focus on women's empowerment for the past few years is unprecedented, which is reflected in the inclusion of women in the workforce moving from 23.3% to 37% in the last five years. The thirty crore Mudra Yojna loans to women entrepreneurs were a great boost to the Nari Shakti initiative. We already have over 10 million Lakhpati Didis and what is truly evident is like a corporate CFO, the FM has revised the earlier target of 20 million Lakhpati Didis to 30 million. The government also plans to invest in initiatives to encourage young girls between the ages of 9 and 14 to undertake the vaccination for cervical cancer which is again a great boost to Nari Shakti.A lot needs to be done to bring more women into all parts of economic growth but the journey so far and the vision of the future is truly inspiring.While India continues on its technological prowess and makes its mark in new technologies like Artificial Intelligence, we need a multi-pronged strategy to harness the power of AI. We need a clear focus on building AI systems in India so that we not only emerge as a global leader in this new era but can build models, which are specific to India that will benefit Indians. At the same time, we need a very wide coverage program to build skills to leverage AI to its fullest potential. The biggest contribution we can make to the inclusion of youth in the economic development of the country is by skilling them in new skill areas. In the last few years, the Skill India Mission has trained 14 million youth, reskilled over 5 million youth and established a staggering 3,000 new ITIs. The future of any country will depend as much on capital investments as on skill investments.The focus on agricultural development and support to the farmer continues through direct financial assistance to farmers. The farmers have benefited by getting crop insurance through PM Fasal Bima Yojana. It's not just the farmers, the PM-SVANidhi provides credit assistance to a large number of street vendors.The last few years have seen the journey of affordable housing through Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY). There is a slight increase in allocation to launch a scheme for encouraging the middle class to build or buy new homes. This investment will likely propel a wider economic development and increase employment.India has seen a tremendous rise in entrepreneurship in the last few years. In order to continue the journey and promote new startups, the government proposes to extend certain tax benefits, which are expiring from March 2024 to March 2025. The MSMEs have not been left behind. With a proposal to provide timely finances to such enterprises, the government has paved the way for their growth, so they can look to compete globally.All in all, it’s a truly inclusive budget with a clear focus on development not just by giving away freebies but enabling the people to participate in the economic development activity. While the FM calls the comprehensive GDP - Governance, Development & Performance – to me, this budget is inclusive of another GDP – gender, demography, and professions.","Akhilesh Tuteja is Partner and Head, Clients and Markets, KPMG in India.

‘Enough domestic sources of demand to counter drag from external sector’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/enough-domestic-sources-of-demand-to-counter-drag-from-external-sector/articleshow/107372012.cms,"Do you think the

creates room for lower interest rates?

One of the issues that the Budget has flagged is the demographic challenge and opportunity and the societal change that is taking place. How do you view this?

Niti Aayog is working on the Viksit Bharat roadmap. What will be the focus areas?

You are as much a representative of the Centre as well as the states. Is it time to revisit the entire formula for transfers to states particularly on the issue of cesses and surcharges?

Suman Bery , who heads Niti Aayog , the govt think tank, is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China, which he says is also an opportunity for India. The economist is confident that Indian states remain resilient. Excerpts of the interview with TOI.The finance ministry expects the economy to grow 7% next year.Given the global situation, how do you see the prospects?The belief in the finance ministry is that we have a possible drag coming from the external sector but that we have other sources. We have enough domestic sources of demand. One has to applaud the political and economic judgment of FM in deciding that it was appropriate to pursue the path of fiscal consolidation. There is transparency. What this actually reflects is responsible economic management, which is one reason we are where we are. Second, it also creates a buffer so that there is policy space if we do encounter headwinds.That’s the hope and expectation. We have an independent central bank and an inflation targeting central bank, so it is up to the monetary policy committee to take a call through the monetary policy committee on the repo rate .The PM has said that when India grows its states grow. India is a composite of 37 states and UTs. They are each at very different points in their demographic transition. There are some states where the net replacement rate is down to 1%, like Kerala . There are others, particularly UP and Bihar, which are in their earliest stage of demographic transition and each one of these states is the size of a large European country. There are two implications of that — one is internal labour mobility and it will become an even larger part of our growth model. The govt has taken several steps to create a unified market. Our main endowment is our human capital and that has to be equipped to participate in global exchange in many ways. We know from China, Japan that the demographic dividend partly depends on markets and on human capital. But the golden period is fairly short lived, about 15 years, when the so called dependency ratio declines. The other big opportunity the PM has been highlighting is bringing women much more into the active labour force.When Niti was set up there was the idea of a three-year vision and a seven-year strategy paper. The reality is that schemes of govt tend to be aligned with the award of the Finance Commission . There are various established building blocks or hand holds which are already a matter of govt policy. The PM is much more interested in a national debate on what it means to be a Viksit Bharat or modern society. We have a collective goal and it is for the democratic polity to define what that goal should be. Its emphatically not for a super mandarin bureaucracy. It is not going to be Lee Kwan Yew’s Singapore led from the top.It’s entirely a finance ministry matter but I would be lying if I didn’t say when I visit certain states there is this complaint. A big frontier would be resource mobilisation at the state level. Second is going to be rationalisation of subsidies not only at the Union level, but also at the state level. All chief ministers sit on my governing council. When they convene as the governing council, I see them in their role as development practitioners. The world is beginning to appreciate quite how much institutional and political maturity India attained in our 75 years and the most fundamental dimension of a democracy, we have orderly transfers of power. There are enough buffers to ensure that what happens in state finances is unlikely to create macro instability. Those risks are well contained by our Constitution. The chief ministers know that they are going to be judged by development outcomes and so you can have the sugar rush of changing of pension plans or various handouts but if the cupboard is bare you are not going to be able to deliver.","Suman Bery is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China.

Government's Marathon to 2047: Emphasis on Fiscal Prudence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/governments-marathon-to-2047-emphasis-on-fiscal-prudence/articleshow/107371788.cms,"What was the thinking behind keeping the vote on account absolutely straight?

So is it the idea to keep the Budget completely transparent?

The capex has risen 11.1% and there is an emphasis on infrastructure spending. But there is also the hope that the private sector will now take over and start capital spending. Given the geopolitical situation, how confident is the govt that it will pan out as planned?

Finance secretary T V Somanathan, in an interview with TOI, says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047 . Excerpts:If you see the Budget speech you will see the emphasis on 2047. The govt has set its sight on running that marathon.Running to 2047 is a marathon , it’s not a sprint. If you are going to run a marathon, you need to be in good shape and you can’t have short-term stimulants or something that will get you some yards and then it’s done.The whole focus is on making India a developed country by 2047, for which a healthy present and a strong fiscal position is an important concomitant. Some purely short term measures don’t really fit into that picture. It’s a consistent picture: focus on the long term for which you need to build strength in the short term and that needs to be done by prudence in fiscal policy and by not doing things which can detract you from that path. Not doing the wrong thing is more important than appearing to do things.The idea is that govt finances may be good, bad or indifferent depending on the times, depending on the circumstances, depending on the policies. But what is the position should be reflected as reasonably and accurately as possible. That is an emphasis. As regards the Finance Commission, again the terms of reference that have been given to them are the terms in the Constitution.What is the means by which the devolution should be done is a matter they have full discretion. They can actually take all kinds of factors into account and in a sense we felt this time based on my review of the previous commissions that the right expression would be less is more. The shorter, less prescriptive terms of reference gives full scope for all stakeholders including state govts to express their viewpoints and for the commission to take a balanced view of the different perspectives and then come to its award. Ultimately the award of the Finance Commission is about devolution and grant for which full scope has now been given to them.n There are incipient signs of private capital expenditure accelerating. There are some surveys I have seen done by some of the chambers industry, which show high levels of investment. The PMI, which is a sort of leading indicator, is also looking pretty healthy. Capacity utilisation is one reason that private sector capital expenditure doesn’t immediately pick up when the economy starts accelerating because there is surplus capacity.But increasingly I get the sense that many industries are beginning to reach levels where they have to add capacity. When that happens capital investment will happen. Another pointer also mentioned in the Budget speech you may notice that our airlines have placed large orders for planes — that is capital expenditure.When you import 1,000 aircraft, it’s just not 1,000 aircraft, there are concomitant additions to ground handling facilities, you need airports to expand, you need to employ people to do that. That means a lot of jobs. The aircraft is capital but then look at the effect it is going to have on skilled jobs. So capital expenditure is happening. I am fairly confident that we will have decent capital expenditure in the year to come and that will become a new source of acceleration.",Finance secretary T V Somanathan says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047.

Income Tax Changes Budget 2024 : In the recent Budget 2024 speech, the Finance Minister kept the Section 80C tax deduction limit unchanged. The maximum limit for claiming tax benefits under Section 80C remains at Rs 1.5 lakh for the current fiscal year 2023-24 and will stay the same for individuals looking to save on taxes through Section 80C investments in the upcoming fiscal year 2024-25.Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions. Individuals can reduce their gross taxable income by up to Rs 1.5 lakh per financial year by engaging in these specific investments or expenditures.You can save on taxes through Section 80C by investing in things like Employees' Provident Fund (EPF), Public Provident Fund (PPF), Equity Linked Saving Scheme (ELSS) mutual funds, National Savings Certificate (NSC), and 5-year tax-saving fixed deposits with banks or post offices. Additionally, paying life insurance policy premiums also qualifies for tax benefits under Section 80C.It is important to note that each eligible investment comes with its specific maximum limit, rate of return, liquidity, and taxation rules for the earned returns, states ET in a report. For instance, the most you can invest in PPF in a financial year is Rs 1.5 lakh. Meanwhile, there's no limit on the amount you can invest in ELSS mutual funds, but the Section 80C deduction is capped at Rs 1.5 lakh.If individuals can't make specific investments, they can still get deductions under Section 80C from their gross taxable income through certain expenses. These expenses include repaying the principal amount of a home loan, tuition fees for children, payment of stamp duty, registration fees, and other costs related to buying a house.Since the financial year 2020-21, individuals without any business income must annually choose between the old and new tax regimes. As of the fiscal year 2023-24, the new tax regime is the default option. Consequently, individuals seeking tax deductions under Section 80C must opt for the old tax regime since this deduction isn't available in the new tax regime. It's crucial for taxpayers to be aware of these rules to make informed decisions about their tax planning and investment strategies.","Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget which is an interim budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year. The budget talks about inclusive development both, social and geographical, especially for youth, women, farmers, and the poor. Continued focus on improving logistics through infrastructure spend on roads, rail, airports, ports increases productivity for companies and citizens alike.To make ‘Viksit Bharat’ by 2047, the government’s focus is on improving and empowering people’s capabilities through various skilling initiatives. It is encouraging to see that Skill India Mission has succeeded in training more than 1.4 crore youth and upskilling and reskilling 54 lakh youth. I am particularly happy to see the continued focus on youth and women entrepreneurship and the announcement of a new fund which will give interest free 50 year loans for startups will provide a domestic fillip to startups supplementing venture capital we have traditionally relied on from abroad.PM Mudra Yojana has sanctioned 43 crore loans aggregating to 22.5 lakh crore to youth entrepreneurs and thirty crore Mudra Yojana loans to women entrepreneurs. There are several other schemes like Fund of Funds, Start-Up India, and Start-Up Credit Guarantee schemes that are assisting our youth. Further, the extension of tax benefits to Start-ups and investments made by sovereign wealth funds/pension funds, till 31st March 2025 depicts the government’s effort to support the startup eco- system.This aligns quite well with India Sanitation Coalition’s efforts to give impetus to the start-up world. Over the past 7 editions of our ISC-FICCI Sanitation Awards, we have recognized and promoted several start-ups in the sanitation space, many of whom are successful businesses now!While the finance minister did not provide detailed information on Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH), the budget allocation sees a slight increase in spend demonstrating continued focus on this highly successful program. The acknowledgement that the private sector has increasingly played a substantial role in addressing WASH issues in both urban and rural areas, with numerous projects underway through Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs), highlights the government's commitment to addressing challenges in this sector.A perfect example is the LightHouse Initiative initiated by the Department of Drinking Water along with the India Sanitation Coalition (ISC) by partnering with major corporates across India to develop model villages in Solid and Liquid Waste Management (SLWM) under SBM-Grameen. From this budget, there is an expectation that the government will persist in prioritizing Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) as the path toward achieving the country's Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6). Additionally, it is hoped that the government will uphold its commitment to making necessary infrastructural investments for SLWM.The budget speech rightly celebrates the fact that we have 83 lakh SHGs and 9 crore women beneficiaries. The microfinance movement in the country and the possibility of empowering women members of SHGs through livelihood skilling is a key to bringing women into mainstream economic advancement.The focus on green growth, rooftop solar, wind, biomass, e-vehicles all help with our green energy thrust. The tourism sector was mentioned and could be a huge job provider for youth and women.Guided by the principle ‘Reform, Perform, and Transform’, the budget emphasizes efficient implementation of various policies by improving coordination with states and relevant stakeholders. This is critical both for infra spend and social programsIt is noteworthy that ISC’s Climate Resilient Coastal Cities project which is being implemented in PPP (Public-Private Partnership) mode in four coastal states of Karnataka, Gujarat, Goa and Maharashtra is congruent with the government’s priority of promoting climate-resilient activities for the blue economy 2.0, a scheme for restoration and adaptation measures, and coastal aquaculture.The budget also focuses on the Aspirational districts program where assistance will be given to the states for faster development of aspirational districts and blocks, including the generation of ample economic opportunities. This is again very crucial as it has a huge potential to transform the landscape of our country while making sure no -one is left behind.Overall, this budget has embraced economic strategies and develops the building blocks that nurture and uphold growth, promote inclusive and sustainable development, and enhance productivity.","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year.

This structure has been criticised for promoting a churn of policies. The ICICI Pru Platinum offers commissions that increase as the insured's savings grow.

HC relief for holding companies facing GST notices over corporate guarantees,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/hc-relief-for-holding-companies-facing-gst-notices-over-corporate-guarantees/articleshow/109898644.cms,"MUMBAI: In a relief for India Inc , the Punjab & Haryana high court has stayed a circular that subjected corporate guarantees, given by holding companies for the benefit of their subsidiaries, to GST.In an interim order, the HC has stayed the circular issued last Oct by the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC). This circular had held that a corporate guarantee given by a holding company to a bank or financial institution for sanction of credit facilities to its subsidiary would be a 'supply of service' subject to GST.It had added that the tax incidence would arise even if no consideration is involved. The matter, pending before the high court, includes a challenge to valuation of corporate guarantees as well.With this stay, for now, India Inc - which is reeling under showcause notices and GST demand orders running into several hundred crores - can breathe easy. Companies that have received showcause notices based on this circular can approach an HC for quashing the same.Demands have been raised on the holding company, if it is in India. If the holding company is overseas, the Indian subsidiary (for whose benefit the corporate guarantee is given) is facing GST demands.Industry representatives told TOI that after the circular, the issue of showcause notices, followed by demands, intensified. Industries across all sectors, ranging from FMCG to infrastructure, received such notices.""The interim order, which has granted a stay, will apply pan-India. The circular, which stated that corporate guarantee was a supply of service, led to a foregone conclusion on part of tax officials, that every corporate guarantee transaction (other than personal guarantee by a director) was subject to GST, without the same being tested on merits,"" said Mannat Waraich, who represented Acme Cleantech Solutions in this matter before the HC.She added, ""If a company has received a showcause notice, which is based on the circular, it should immediately approach the jurisdictional high court for quashing the same. If an order raising a demand has been issued, the company should approach the appellate authority or the high court seeking to quash it. It would be up to the quasi-judicial authorities/courts to quash the demand or keep it in abeyance.""Sujit Ghosh, senior advocate, Supreme Court, who led the arguments for the company, said, “This interim order essentially seeks to enforce that we have a fundamental separation of power (under our constitutional construct) between the executive and the judicial wing of governance. The executive wing being the tax administrator (i.e. CBIC) in this case cannot fetter with the adjudicatory and appellate powers of the quasi-judicial authorities.”Waraich added, “We have also challenged Rule 28(2) of the CGST Rules (amended) which provides that GST at 18% will be payable on 1% of the value of the guarantee or the actual consideration, whichever is higher. These rules have also been challenged as being arbitrary, discriminatory, and confiscatory in nature.”","In an interim order, the HC has stayed the circular issued last Oct by the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs.

Namakkal poultry farmers want to put all their eggs in one basket,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/namakkal-poultry-farmers-want-to-put-all-their-eggs-in-one-basket/articleshow/109863695.cms,"If Kerala gets bird flu, Namakkal gets the sniffles. Poultry farmers in Namakkal, egg basket of India, want to ring-fence their trade so that they don’t suffer if avian influenza breaks out elsewhere.Things were rosy till 2006 or so, when the region was exporting up to one crore eggs a day to 17 countries in the Middle East and western Africa. From 2007-08 onwards, outbreaks of bird flu were reported from several states including Assam, Manipur, West Bengal, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh.Importers of Indian eggs treat the whole country as one zone and if there is an outbreak of bird flu in any state, they ban all eggs from India.Exports came down to 5 lakh to 10 lakh in 2008-09 and almost nil in 2012-13. While countries opened up a little later, repeated outbreaks of the disease in a few states hit export of Indian eggs.While there are a few pockets across India that have a concentration of poultry farms for layers (eggs) including Andhra Pradesh, Bihar and Punjab, Namakkal has emerged as the largest base. “Today, there are 1,100 poultry farms in Namakkal region alone and they collectively breed six crore hens and produce five crore eggs a day,” says P V Senthil, general secretary, Livestock Agri Farmers Trade Association (LIFT) and MD, Kaveris Bio Proteins Pvt Ltd, exporter of eggs since 1990.Traditionally, Namakkal region used to supply eggs up to Kolkata in the east. The emergence of Bihar has taken away those markets and Namakkal today mostly supplies to Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, Kerala and, to an extent, Bangalore. That’s why exports come in handy. Farmers can hedge their business by exporting at least 20% of daily production. Otherwise, frequent glut in the market forces farmers to sell at below permitted farmgate prices.When the poultry industry reached out to the Centre, it offered to create “compartments” – largescale poultry farms, which after implementing certain norms, can be certified as disease free and thereby making those eggs eligible for exports. But this involves investment of `50 lakh to `1 crore and benefits only large farms.Only four farms have been certified under this policy so far and all of them are in Tamil Nadu -- two in Namakkal and one each in Trichy and Erode. “Together they produce 16 lakh eggs per day, of which just 30%-40% can be exported”. The potential for exports is around 2 crore - 3 crore eggs a day.“There are several small-scale poultry farmers in the Namakkal region and additional investment of this scale is next to impossible. One of the conditions under the ‘compartment’ plan is that no other farm should be there within a one km radius of a certified farm. This makes almost 80% - 90% of the poultry farms in the Namakkal region ineligible. Hence, we are pushing for the entire Namakkal region to be notified as one region and ‘bird flu free’,” adds Senthil.","There are 1,100 poultry farms in Namakkal region alone.

NEW DELHI: The Enforcement Directorate on Monday conducted raids in multiple locations across Ranchi and recovered huge amount of 'unaccounted' cash from an alleged close aide of Jharkhand rural development minister and Congress MLA Alamgir Alam.Video footage showed wads of currency notes spread in a room from the house of the domestic help allegedly linked to the private secretary of rural development minister Alamgir Alam.Talking to PTI, Alam said ""I have no official information regarding this so far.""""I have been watching TV and it says the premise is linked to the official PS (private secretary) provided to me by the government,"" he added.Alam (70), is a Congress leader and represents the Pakur seat in the Jharkhand assembly.According to the officials, more than Rs 20 crore has been counted from the cash recovered in the raid and the counting is still in progress.ED sources said the note-counting machines have been deployed to count the cash to ascertain the exact amount which could range between Rs 20-30 crore.Earlier in February 2023, the agency had apprehended Virendra K Ram, the chief engineer at the Jharkhand Rural Development Department for, to alleged irregularities in implementation of some of the government schemes.""Veerendra Kumar Ram, posted as chief engineer in the Rural Works Department in Ranchi, had generated proceeds of crime in the name of commission from contractors in lieu of allotment of tenders to them,"" the agency had alleged in a statement issued last year in April after it attached assets worth Rs 39 crore of the officer.""The proceeds of crime thus generated were used by Veerendra Kumar Ram and his family members to live a very lavish lifestyle,"" it said.Soon after the raids, BJP accused the Congress party of promoting rampant corruption in the state.Taking to X, Jharkhand BJP spokesperson Pratul Shah Deo posted,""Don't be surprised.

Planning to invest in NPS? Top 5 reasons you should consider National Pension System,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/retirement-planning/planning-to-invest-in-nps-top-5-reasons-you-should-consider-national-pension-system/articleshow/109891095.cms,"Here are five compelling reasons to consider investing in NPS:

NPS: Higher Returns Due To Low Charges

NPS Tax Benefits

Contributions to the scheme are eligible for deduction under Section 80C, subject to the overall limit of Rs 1.5 lakh.

Additionally, there is a separate deduction of up to Rs 50,000 under Section 80CCD(1b), which is exclusive to NPS and over and above the Section 80C deduction. Taxpayers in the 30% bracket can save up to Rs 15,600 by investing Rs 50,000 in the scheme, effectively reducing their net outflow to Rs 34,400 (or Rs 2,866 per month) after considering the tax savings.

The third tax-saving option through NPS has the potential to significantly reduce an individual's tax liability. Under Section 80CCD(2), up to 10% of an employee's basic salary contributed to NPS is tax-exempt. For instance, if an individual has a basic salary of Rs 50,000, their company can reduce a taxable emolument by Rs 5,000 and contribute that amount to the employee's NPS account every month. The annual contribution of Rs 60,000 to NPS through this method can lower the employee's tax by Rs 18,720. However, this NPS contribution should be a part of the individual's emoluments and can only be facilitated by the employer. It is worth noting that the deduction under Section 80CCD(2) is available even under the new income tax regime.

NPS Multiple Choices

Flexibility with NPS

NPS Liquidity

The National Pension System (NPS) has evolved over time, becoming more user-friendly and adaptable to the needs of investors. The Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) has introduced new features and simplified the process of opening an NPS account, allowing individuals to do so online within minutes, provided they have the necessary documents.Additionally, the Finance Ministry has implemented tax benefits on contributions, including exclusive tax deductions for NPS investments and making 60% of the maturity corpus tax-free.Consequently, the NPS is gaining momentum, with 8.73 lakh voluntary investors joining the scheme in 2023-24, translating to an average of 2,391 investors per day or nearly 100 every hour. Despite this growth, the NPS has only captured 10% of the total investing population in the country, with just 55 lakh voluntary investors.Investors who overlook the NPS may be overlooking a valuable investment opportunity, states an ET analysis by Babar Zaidi. Rahul Bhagat, CEO of DSP Pension Fund believes that the NPS offers everything that one looks for in a retirement savings product. “It is a long-term investment with very low costs and a low risk profile.""NPS has remarkably low fund management charges compared to mutual funds and insurance companies. ""The NPS is the cheapest product available in the Indian market,"" says Bhagat. Investors pay a mere Rs 30-90 per lakh annually, which is on par with ETFs offered by mutual funds and significantly lower than the 2-2.5% charged by actively managed equity funds.Also Read | Important updates for NPS subscribers: New charges and security measures announced by PFRDA Although a 2% annual fund management charge may seem insignificant, it accumulates to a substantial amount over time due to compounding. For instance, if you invest Rs 5,000 per month through an SIP in a mutual fund with a 2% annual charge, you will pay approximately Rs 19 lakh in fund management fees over 25 years. In contrast, investing the same amount in the NPS, assuming the maximum fund management charge of 0.09%, will cost you only Rs 1 lakh over the same period, assuming a compounded annual return of 9%.The low charges of the NPS result in higher returns for investors.Consequently, NPS equity funds have consistently outperformed large-cap mutual funds over the past decade, and even the flexi-cap category by a narrow margin. For investors who prefer not to lock their money in the NPS until the age of 60, the NPS Tier II option offers the flexibility of investing without tax benefits on contributions and no restrictions on withdrawals. You can invest today and withdraw the money the next day without any exit charges.The NPS Tier II investments do not qualify for any tax benefits, but the Tier I option comes with several tax advantages. NPS offers three ways to save on taxes.NPS investors now have the option to select from 11 different pension fund managers. Additionally, they have the flexibility to switch their pension fund manager annually. Till last year, an NPS investor could invest in schemes of only one pension fund manager. However, it's important to note that the performance of these pension fund managers differs across the four available categories.Also Read | When will gold prices hit Rs 2 lakh mark? Here’s what experts say NPS has introduced several changes to provide investors with more flexibility. One of the key changes is that investors can now modify their asset allocation up to four times annually. The most significant advantage is that ""switching from one asset class to another or changing your pension fund manager will have no tax implications."" In contrast, switching between mutual funds is considered a sale, and any gains are subject to taxation.Moreover, the NPS has given investors greater autonomy in determining their asset allocation. Previously, there was a 50% limit on equity investments, which many investors found restrictive. However, this cap has now been increased to 75%, catering to the needs of younger investors and those with a higher risk tolerance.Investors can continue contributing to the NPS until the age of 70. Furthermore, they have the option to postpone the withdrawal of the 60% tax-free portion of their corpus until they reach 75 years of age. This allows investors to take advantage of the NPS's low-cost structure well into their retirement years while still having the ability to make withdrawals from their accumulated funds.Also Read | RBI new loan rules: Is your bank overcharging you on interest? 4 ways in which customers may be paying extra NPS does not necessarily mean that your funds are inaccessible until you retire. Similar to the Provident Fund, the NPS allows withdrawals under certain circumstances, such as medical emergencies, marriage or education of children, and purchasing or constructing a house. However, there are some restrictions on these withdrawals.To be eligible for withdrawals, you must have been an NPS subscriber for a minimum of three years. Additionally, you are only permitted to make withdrawals three times throughout the entire duration of your NPS account. One can withdraw up to 25% of the contribution in NPS at any time, excluding those made by one's employer.","The National Pension System (NPS) has evolved over time, becoming more user- friendly and adaptable to the needs of investors.

And he's seen how,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/warren-buffett-says-ai-may-be-better-for-scammers-than-society-and-hes-seen-how/articleshow/109857585.cms,"OMAHA: Warren Buffett cautioned the tens of thousands of shareholders who packed an arena for his annual meeting that artificial intelligence scams could become ""the growth industry of all time.""Doubling down on his cautionary words from last year, Buffett told the throngs he recently came face to face with the downside of AI. And it looked and sounded just like him.Someone made a fake video of Buffett, apparently convincing enough that the so-called Oracle of Omaha himself said he could imagine it tricking him into sending money overseas.The billionaire investing guru predicted scammers will seize on the technology, and may do more harm with it than society can wring good.""As someone who doesn't understand a damn thing about it, it has enormous potential for good and enormous potential for harm and I just don't know how that plays out,"" he said.EARNINGS BEFORE MUSINGSThe day started early Saturday with Berkshire Hathaway announcing a steep drop in earnings as the paper value of its investments plummeted and it pared its Apple holdings. The company reported a $12.7 billion profit, or $8,825 per Class A share, in first the quarter, down 64% from $35.5 billion, or $24,377 per A share a year ago.But Buffett encourages investors to pay more attention to the conglomerate's operating earnings from the companies it actually owns. Those jumped 39% to $11.222 billion, or $7,796.47 per Class A share, led by insurance companies' performance.None of it that got in the way of the fun.Throngs flooded the arena to buy up Squishmallows of Buffett and former Vice Chairman Charlie Munger , who died last fall. The event attracts investors from all over the world and is unlike any other company meeting. Those attending for the first time are driven by an urgency to get here while the 93-year-old Buffett is still alive.""This is one of the best events in the world to learn about investing. To learn from the gods of the industry,"" said Akshay Bhansali, who spent the better part of two days traveling from India to Omaha.A NOTABLE ABSENCEDevotees come from all over the world to vacuum up tidbits of wisdom from Buffett, who famously dubbed the meeting 'Woodstock for Capitalists.'But a key ingredient was missing this year: It was the first meeting since Munger died.The meeting opened with a video tribute highlighting some of his best known quotes, including classic lines like ""If people weren't so often wrong, we wouldn't be so rich."" The video also featured skits the investors made with Hollywood stars over the years, including a ""Desperate Housewives"" spoof where one of the women introduced Munger as her boyfriend and another in which actress Jaimie Lee Curtis swooned over him.As the video ended, the arena erupted in a prolonged standing ovation honoring Munger, whom Buffett called ""the architect of Berkshire Hathaway.""Buffett said Munger remained curious about the world up until the end of his life at 99, hosting dinner parties, meeting with people and holding regular Zoom calls.""Like his hero Ben Franklin, Charlie wanted to understand everything,"" Buffett said.For decades, Munger and Buffett functioned as a classic comedy duo, with Buffett offering lengthy setups to Munger's witty one-liners. He once referred to unproven internet companies as ""turds.""Together, the pair transformed Berkshire from a floundering textile mill into a massive conglomerate made up of a variety of interests, from insurance companies such as Geico to BNSF railroad to several major utilities and an assortment of other companies.Munger often summed up the key to Berkshire's success as ""trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very intelligent."" He and Buffett also were known for sticking to businesses they understood well.""Warren always did at least 80% of the talking. But Charlie was a great foil,"" said Stansberry Research analyst Whitney Tilson, who was looking forward to his 27th consecutive meeting.NEXT GEN LEADERSMunger's absence, however, created space for shareholders to get to know better the two executives who directly oversee Berkshire's companies: Ajit Jain, who manages the insurance units; and Abel, who handles everything else and has been named Buffett's successor. The two shared the main stage with Buffett this year.The first time Buffett kicked a question to Abel, he mistakenly said ""Charlie?"" Abel shrugged off the mistake and dove into the challenges utilities face from the increased risk of wildfires and some regulators' reluctance to let them collect a reasonable profit.Morningstar analyst Greggory Warren said he believes Abel spoke up more Saturday and let shareholders see some of the brilliance Berkshire executives talk about.Abel offered a twist on Munger's classic ""I have nothing to add"" line by often starting his answers Saturday by saying ""The only thing I would add.""""Greg's a rock star,"" said Chris Bloomstran, president of Semper Augustus Investments Group. ""The bench is deep. He won't have the same humor at the meeting. But I think we all come here to get a reminder every year to be rational.""A LOOK TO THE FUTUREBuffett has made clear that Abel will be Berkshire's next CEO, but he said Saturday that he had changed his opinion on how the company's investment portfolio should be handled. He had previously said it would fall to two investment managers who handle small chunks of the portfolio now. On Saturday, Buffett endorsed Abel for the gig, as well as overseeing the operating businesses and any acquisitions.""He understands businesses extremely well. and if you understand businesses, you understand common stocks,"" Buffett said. Ultimately, it will be up to the board to decide, but the billionaire said he might come back and haunt them if they try to do it differently.Overall, Buffett said Berkshire's system of having all the noninsurance companies report to Abel and the insurers report to Jain is working well. He himself hardly gets any calls from managers anymore because they get more guidance from Abel and Jain.""This place would work extremely well the next day if something happened to me,"" Buffett said.Nevertheless, the best applause line of the day was Buffett's closing remark: ""I not only hope that you come next year but I hope that I come next year.""","Buffett: AI has ""enormous potential for good and enormous potential for harm"" Berkshire Hathaway announces a steep drop in earnings as the paper value of its investments plummeted.

To friends, she said he was ""a stockbroker that does something with the weather."" Malinow couldn't really object - he knew most people had no clue about financial contracts based on things like rainfall and wind.That's beginning to change. Against a backdrop of rising climate volatility and social shifts, demand for weather derivatives is surging.Average trading volumes for listed products jumped more than 260% in 2023, according to the CME Group , with the number of outstanding contracts currently 48% higher than a year ago. And that publicly traded corner could make up as little as 10% of all activity, according to industry estimates; outstanding derivatives may be worth as much as $25 billion based on notional value.""There's a lot more trajectory to our business right now,"" says Malinow, the founder and chief executive officer of advisory firm Parameter Climate. ""The heightened fragility from direct weather volatility, supply-chain issues, inflation, geopolitics. It means weather can eat up a bigger part of the bottom line now.""Wall Street's better-known weather bets, catastrophe bonds, are also riding high following a year of bumper returns. But this boom is playing out in derivatives, which provide a different kind of hedge: Protection from less severe but more common meteorological threats. While a cat bond may pay out if a 100-year storm tears through a community, a weather derivative can compensate a tourism business if there are too many rainy days, or a farmer if a hot summer stresses her crops.Part of the jump in demand is driven by corporations newly confronting their exposure to the elements. In some cases, it's because their operations have already been impacted, in others because they're responding to investor and consumer pressures. In many jurisdictions, regulators are beginning to compel firms to quantify how much of a threat the weather is to their business.

That's why Buffett encourages investors to pay more attention to the conglomerate's operating earnings that exclude the investment figures. By that measure, Berkshire's operating earnings jumped 39% to $11.222 billion from last year's $8.065 billion as its insurance companies led a strong performance.The three analysts surveyed by FactSet Research had predicted operating earnings of $6,701.87 per Class A share.Buffett did sell off nearly $6 billion in stocks during the quarter, including trimming about 13% of Berkshire's massive Apple stake. The investment in the iPhone maker is still the biggest one in the $364 billion portfolio at $135.4 billion.But the estimated value of Berkshire's Apple stake suggests that Buffett sold off more than 100 million shares. Buffett has said he invested in Apple's stock because of how devoted consumers are to the iPhone and other Apple products.Apple CEO Tim Cook, who is at the Berkshire meeting, told CNBC that he still considers it a privilege to have Berkshire as a major shareholder.Berkshire reported a $2.6 billion underwriting profit at its insurers, up from $911 million a year ago.BNSF railroad's profits did disappoint and drop 8% to $1.143 billion, but most of its many other companies delivered solid results, including a 72% jump in operating profits at the utility unit that added $717 million to Berkshire's total.Berkshire's revenue grew 5% to $89.87 billion in the quarter. The two analysts who reported estimates to FactSet predicted $87.044 billion revenue.With no major acquisitions in sight, Berkshire's massive cash pile continued to grow to a record $188.993 billion in the quarter.
