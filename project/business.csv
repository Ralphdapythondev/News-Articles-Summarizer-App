In today's rapidly evolving job market, your application may face rejection before a human even lays eyes on it. Across various industries, companies are increasingly leveraging artificial intelligence tools, including generative AI, to streamline their recruitment processes.According to an ET report, these tools assist in candidate sourcing, resume screening , skills assessment, predictive analytics, and bias reduction. In some cases, human involvement only begins at the interview stage, while in others, GenAI bots even aid managers in conducting interviews.Despite concerns surrounding data privacy, potential discrimination, and the inability to recognize hidden potential in candidates, HR executives maintain that AI is making the hiring process more efficient and faster.Genpact, a professional services firm, recently introduced IMatch, an in-house resume parsing and job-matching engine powered by GenAI.""Covering 40% of its new hires, AI tools have made the hiring process touchless till the interview stage,"" said Ritu Bhatia, Genpact's global hiring leader. Bhatia said that the use of AI has led to a 15% increase in recruiter productivity and a reduction in the time to hire from 62 days to 43.By analyzing historical data, market trends, and internal talent metrics, AI tools enable companies to gain valuable insights into emerging skill demands and talent availability. This information helps them develop effective recruitment strategies to address both current and future talent needs.Also Read | Why Apple had to install currency note counting machines in its Delhi and Mumbai stores Simplilearn, an edtech company, has been utilizing ChatGPT and other AI tools for more than a year to streamline job descriptions, develop proficiency assessments, and administer psychometric tests. According to Archana Krishna, the company's chief HR officer, ""This enables us to reduce time on mundane tasks and improve productivity and efficiency.""Rajesh Bharatiya, the CEO of Peoplefy, a recruitment services provider, stated that GenAI-based tools help personalize the process, such as sending recruitment mass mailers tailored to each candidate's unique experiences and background.

Rajesh Jain, the chief HR officer, reported, ""Our hiring efficiencies have improved drastically. Before using the GenAI bot for interviewing, our selection ratio was 15%. Now this rate has increased to 55%, a 40% jump in my selection rate overnight,"" emphasizing the significance of this improvement.Despite the benefits, experts caution that there are certain drawbacks to using AI in hiring practices at its current stage of development. These concerns include ethical considerations surrounding data privacy, algorithmic transparency, and the potential for discrimination. Additionally, AI may lack the ability to evaluate soft skills, amplify biases, and identify potential in candidates.","Companies are increasingly leveraging artificial intelligence tools, including generative AI, to streamline their recruitment processes.

How RBI’s record Rs 2.1 lakh crore dividend payout to government may help improve India’s credit rating,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/how-rbis-record-rs-2-1-lakh-crore-dividend-payout-to-government-may-help-improve-indias-credit-rating/articleshow/110425577.cms,"The record Rs 2.1 lakh crore dividend that the government will receive from the Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) is a positive development, as it is nearly double the amount budgeted from all financial institutions combined.Several factors could have contributed to the record profit, including the significant increase in interest rates in the United States, where the RBI invests a substantial portion of its $644 billion foreign exchange reserves (Rs 54 lakh crore), says says a TOI analysis by Mayur Shetty.Additionally, the RBI has been actively buying and selling dollars this year compared to the previous year, as foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have been selling equities. Furthermore, the RBI's money market operations have played a role in its earnings. To combat inflation, the RBI has maintained liquidity in a deficit mode, providing opportunities to lend to banks.RBI serves as both a regulatory body and a monetary authority, responsible for managing the money supply and overseeing foreign exchange markets. To stabilize the rupee against speculative inflows, RBI accumulates foreign currency reserves.Also Read | Explained: How RBI managed to give the highest ever Rs 2.1 lakh crore dividend payout to government During challenging times, such as the global financial crisis or the pandemic, central banks expanded their balance sheets through quantitative easing, which involves injecting money into the economy by purchasing bonds from banks.As a result, RBI earns profits from interest on domestic and foreign bonds, as well as from market operations. In its forex operations, RBI sells dollars it purchased during times of surplus when there is a scarcity, making a substantial profit as these sales are at prevailing market prices.However, generating profits is not the primary goal for RBI. The surpluses are a byproduct of RBI working towards its objectives of maintaining financial and market stability.It is often observed that RBI generates more profits during difficult times because it is during crises that the central bank's intervention in forex and money markets intensifies.Also Read | Why RBI is stocking up aggressively on gold reserves; central bank buys 1.5 times more gold in Jan-April than entire 2023 Profit cannot be an objective for the central bank in its market operations, as RBI is the biggest insider in the market.While the RBI can create money, the dividends it pays to the government come from its actual earnings. A significant portion of these earnings is derived from higher interest income on foreign securities and profits from selling foreign exchange. This record surplus could aid India in improving its credit rating , the TOI analysis says.According to S&P, this additional amount is approximately 0.35% of the GDP. Assuming all other factors remain constant, this windfall would reduce the fiscal deficit by that percentage. S&P has indicated that if the government uses the funds to reduce its deficit (by reducing borrowing), it would increase the likelihood of a ratings upgrade.An upgrade would enhance India's standing among global investors, which is a positive sign for markets as it would attract capital inflows. Alternatively, if the government decides to use the windfall to stimulate the economy or provide relief to the poor, it would also be beneficial, as it would boost consumption.The bond market is rallying due to record revenues generated through dividends and the Goods and Services Tax (GST), leading markets to anticipate a significant decrease in government borrowing. When the government borrows less, more funds become available for corporate borrowers, causing interest rates to decline. As interest rates fall, existing bonds that offer higher rates are sold at a premium.","The record Rs 2.1 lakh crore dividend that the government will receive from the Reserve Bank of India is a positive development, as it is nearly double the amount budgeted from all financial institutions combined. Several factors could have contributed to the record profit, including the significant increase in interest rates in the United States.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110435441,imgsize-1225804,width-400,resizemode-4/110435441.jpg"

Musk's xAI raises $6 billion from VC funds,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/musks-xai-raises-6-billion-from-vc-funds/articleshow/110479955.cms,"Elon Musk 's artificial intelligence startup xAI has raised $6 billion to accelerate its challenge to his former allies at OpenAI .

The series-B round, announced in a blog post on May 26, comes less than a year after xAI's debut and marks one of the bigger investments in the nascent field of developing AI tools. Musk had been an early supporter of AI, backing OpenAI before it introduced ChatGPT in late 2022. He later withdrew his support from the venture and has advocated caution because of the technology's potential dangers. He was among a large group of industry leaders urging a pause to AI development last year.

Musk launched a rival to OpenAI's ChatGPT in Nov, called Grok, which was trained on and integrated into X, the social network formerly known as Twitter. That has so far been the most visible product of xAI's work, which is led by executives with prior experience at Alphabet's DeepMind, Microsoft and Tesla.

The company intends to use the funds to bring its first products to market, build advanced infrastructure and accelerate the development of future technologies, it said in the blog. Its pre-money valuation was $18 billion, Musk said in a post on X. Marquee venture capital names including Sequoia Capital and Andreessen Horowitz backed the fundraising, which is one of the largest so far in the industry. Microsoft has invested about $13 billion in OpenAI, while Amazon put about $4 billion into Anthropic.

The finance minister set the stage for a ""Viksit Bharat by 2047"", on the core principles of ‘Sabka Saath’, ‘Sabka Vikas’, ‘Sabka Vishwas’, with ‘Sabka Prayas’ being added as a new theme in the interim Budget.This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data i.e., farmer welfare and N for Nari utthan i.e., support for women entrepreneurs.These form the pillars of a comprehensive inclusive development. The Government's commitment to sustainable development under the strategy for Amrit Kaal includes achieving 'Net Zero' by 2070, rooftop solarization for one crore households and robust health initiatives.The Indian economy's resilience takes center stage amidst positive indicators of declining current account deficit as a percentage of GDP, falling unemployment rates, and a notable rise in digital transactions. These statistics affirm the robustness of the economy, showcasing a trajectory of growth and stability.The achievements in taxation reforms are nothing short of remarkable, with direct tax collections more than trebling in the last decade, the number of tax return filers increasing by 2.4 times, average processing time of tax returns plummeting from 93 days in FY 2013-14 to an impressive 10 days in FY 2023-24, resulting in issuance of quick refunds. These are the results of consistent progressive measures thus obviating the need for, and rightly avoiding, any last-minute populist measures.No change in existing tax rates, both for direct and indirect taxes, is a good indicator of stability and predictability for investors and taxpayers.A welcome move to waive outstanding tax demands that are minor, disputed, and unreconciled. This involves the withdrawal of outstanding direct tax demands up to Rs. 25,000 pertaining to the period up to FY 2009-10 and up to Rs.10,000 for FY 2010-11 to 2014-15.The Government's commitment to fostering a business-friendly environment is evident in its intent to extend specific tax benefits for start-ups, investments by sovereign wealth funds/ pension funds, and certain IFSC units. The extension has been made now until March 31, 2025. This might help in creating a conducive landscape for business.To align with the CBDT notification issued earlier, the provisions relating to tax collection at source concerning remittances under the Liberalized Remittance Scheme have now been formally incorporated in the Finance Bill, 2024, setting the rate at 20% for amounts exceeding Rs. 7 lakhs in a financial year.The Finance Bill, 2024 proposes an extension of the time limit for introducing the faceless scheme by the Central Government for transfer pricing proceedings, DRP Proceedings, and ITAT Proceedings, up to March 31, 2025.The interim Budget 2024 may not have proposed significant tax announcements, but it very well positioned the prelude to the full budget post the upcoming elections. Considering the potential impact on the population across the four pillars of GYAN, a sizable portion of India stands to be covered. The interim Budget’s focus on the tax front resembles a report card, highlighting the maturity achieved by our tax system. The enhancement of taxpayer services was emphasized as a key priority.","This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data and N for Nari utthan.

Interim Budget for a Viksit Bharat: It’s for everyone and all,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/interim-budget-for-a-viksit-bharat-its-for-everyone-and-all/articleshow/107497439.cms,"By Akhilesh Tuteja

The Finance Minister on February 01, 2024, delivered a truly innovative interim budget. At first glance, it did not seem like an interim budget but looked more like the budget to drive further growth and a continuum of inclusive growth-oriented investments.At the outset, this budget brings a wonderful balance between fiscal prudence and continued investment for growth. It's not easy to continue the glide path of reducing the fiscal deficit and continuing to make significant investments in all areas including infrastructure, R&D, energy transition, technology, skilling, and social welfare. The surprising reduction in fiscal deficit of 5.8% as against the budgeted 5.9% for FY24 and the projection of 5.1% in FY25 with a clear focus on increasing investments was a huge positive.This was a budget for everyone and all because it caters to every part of the Indian economy and society. The FM has carefully catered to the investment needs of various sectors. The continued focus on youth, impoverished, women and farmers to increase their involvement and contribution to economic growth is evident. By committing an 11.1% increase in capital expenditure to 11,11,111 lakh crore, the FM has clearly brought every single 1 in this growth journey.What was very impressive was the inclusion strategy of the government. The focus on women's empowerment for the past few years is unprecedented, which is reflected in the inclusion of women in the workforce moving from 23.3% to 37% in the last five years. The thirty crore Mudra Yojna loans to women entrepreneurs were a great boost to the Nari Shakti initiative. We already have over 10 million Lakhpati Didis and what is truly evident is like a corporate CFO, the FM has revised the earlier target of 20 million Lakhpati Didis to 30 million. The government also plans to invest in initiatives to encourage young girls between the ages of 9 and 14 to undertake the vaccination for cervical cancer which is again a great boost to Nari Shakti.A lot needs to be done to bring more women into all parts of economic growth but the journey so far and the vision of the future is truly inspiring.While India continues on its technological prowess and makes its mark in new technologies like Artificial Intelligence, we need a multi-pronged strategy to harness the power of AI. We need a clear focus on building AI systems in India so that we not only emerge as a global leader in this new era but can build models, which are specific to India that will benefit Indians. At the same time, we need a very wide coverage program to build skills to leverage AI to its fullest potential. The biggest contribution we can make to the inclusion of youth in the economic development of the country is by skilling them in new skill areas. In the last few years, the Skill India Mission has trained 14 million youth, reskilled over 5 million youth and established a staggering 3,000 new ITIs. The future of any country will depend as much on capital investments as on skill investments.The focus on agricultural development and support to the farmer continues through direct financial assistance to farmers. The farmers have benefited by getting crop insurance through PM Fasal Bima Yojana. It's not just the farmers, the PM-SVANidhi provides credit assistance to a large number of street vendors.The last few years have seen the journey of affordable housing through Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY). There is a slight increase in allocation to launch a scheme for encouraging the middle class to build or buy new homes. This investment will likely propel a wider economic development and increase employment.India has seen a tremendous rise in entrepreneurship in the last few years. In order to continue the journey and promote new startups, the government proposes to extend certain tax benefits, which are expiring from March 2024 to March 2025. The MSMEs have not been left behind. With a proposal to provide timely finances to such enterprises, the government has paved the way for their growth, so they can look to compete globally.All in all, it’s a truly inclusive budget with a clear focus on development not just by giving away freebies but enabling the people to participate in the economic development activity.

‘Enough domestic sources of demand to counter drag from external sector’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/enough-domestic-sources-of-demand-to-counter-drag-from-external-sector/articleshow/107372012.cms,"Do you think the

creates room for lower interest rates?

One of the issues that the Budget has flagged is the demographic challenge and opportunity and the societal change that is taking place. How do you view this?

Niti Aayog is working on the Viksit Bharat roadmap. What will be the focus areas?

You are as much a representative of the Centre as well as the states. Is it time to revisit the entire formula for transfers to states particularly on the issue of cesses and surcharges?

Suman Bery , who heads Niti Aayog , the govt think tank, is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China, which he says is also an opportunity for India. The economist is confident that Indian states remain resilient. Excerpts of the interview with TOI.The finance ministry expects the economy to grow 7% next year. Given the global situation, how do you see the prospects?The belief in the finance ministry is that we have a possible drag coming from the external sector but that we have other sources. We have enough domestic sources of demand. One has to applaud the political and economic judgment of FM in deciding that it was appropriate to pursue the path of fiscal consolidation. There is transparency. What this actually reflects is responsible economic management, which is one reason we are where we are. Second, it also creates a buffer so that there is policy space if we do encounter headwinds.That’s the hope and expectation. We have an independent central bank and an inflation targeting central bank, so it is up to the monetary policy committee to take a call through the monetary policy committee on the repo rate .The PM has said that when India grows its states grow. India is a composite of 37 states and UTs. They are each at very different points in their demographic transition. There are some states where the net replacement rate is down to 1%, like Kerala . There are others, particularly UP and Bihar, which are in their earliest stage of demographic transition and each one of these states is the size of a large European country. There are two implications of that — one is internal labour mobility and it will become an even larger part of our growth model. The govt has taken several steps to create a unified market. Our main endowment is our human capital and that has to be equipped to participate in global exchange in many ways. We know from China, Japan that the demographic dividend partly depends on markets and on human capital. But the golden period is fairly short lived, about 15 years, when the so called dependency ratio declines. The other big opportunity the PM has been highlighting is bringing women much more into the active labour force.When Niti was set up there was the idea of a three-year vision and a seven-year strategy paper. The reality is that schemes of govt tend to be aligned with the award of the Finance Commission . There are various established building blocks or hand holds which are already a matter of govt policy. The PM is much more interested in a national debate on what it means to be a Viksit Bharat or modern society. We have a collective goal and it is for the democratic polity to define what that goal should be. Its emphatically not for a super mandarin bureaucracy. It is not going to be Lee Kwan Yew’s Singapore led from the top.It’s entirely a finance ministry matter but I would be lying if I didn’t say when I visit certain states there is this complaint. A big frontier would be resource mobilisation at the state level. Second is going to be rationalisation of subsidies not only at the Union level, but also at the state level. All chief ministers sit on my governing council. When they convene as the governing council, I see them in their role as development practitioners. The world is beginning to appreciate quite how much institutional and political maturity India attained in our 75 years and the most fundamental dimension of a democracy, we have orderly transfers of power. There are enough buffers to ensure that what happens in state finances is unlikely to create macro instability. Those risks are well contained by our Constitution. The chief ministers know that they are going to be judged by development outcomes and so you can have the sugar rush of changing of pension plans or various handouts but if the cupboard is bare you are not going to be able to deliver.","Suman Bery is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China.

Government's Marathon to 2047: Emphasis on Fiscal Prudence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/governments-marathon-to-2047-emphasis-on-fiscal-prudence/articleshow/107371788.cms,"What was the thinking behind keeping the vote on account absolutely straight?

So is it the idea to keep the Budget completely transparent?

The capex has risen 11.1% and there is an emphasis on infrastructure spending. But there is also the hope that the private sector will now take over and start capital spending. Given the geopolitical situation, how confident is the govt that it will pan out as planned?

Finance secretary T V Somanathan, in an interview with TOI, says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047 . Excerpts:If you see the Budget speech you will see the emphasis on 2047. The govt has set its sight on running that marathon.Running to 2047 is a marathon , it’s not a sprint. If you are going to run a marathon, you need to be in good shape and you can’t have short-term stimulants or something that will get you some yards and then it’s done.The whole focus is on making India a developed country by 2047, for which a healthy present and a strong fiscal position is an important concomitant. Some purely short term measures don’t really fit into that picture. It’s a consistent picture: focus on the long term for which you need to build strength in the short term and that needs to be done by prudence in fiscal policy and by not doing things which can detract you from that path. Not doing the wrong thing is more important than appearing to do things.The idea is that govt finances may be good, bad or indifferent depending on the times, depending on the circumstances, depending on the policies. But what is the position should be reflected as reasonably and accurately as possible. That is an emphasis. As regards the Finance Commission, again the terms of reference that have been given to them are the terms in the Constitution.What is the means by which the devolution should be done is a matter they have full discretion. They can actually take all kinds of factors into account and in a sense we felt this time based on my review of the previous commissions that the right expression would be less is more. The shorter, less prescriptive terms of reference gives full scope for all stakeholders including state govts to express their viewpoints and for the commission to take a balanced view of the different perspectives and then come to its award. Ultimately the award of the Finance Commission is about devolution and grant for which full scope has now been given to them.n There are incipient signs of private capital expenditure accelerating. There are some surveys I have seen done by some of the chambers industry, which show high levels of investment. The PMI, which is a sort of leading indicator, is also looking pretty healthy. Capacity utilisation is one reason that private sector capital expenditure doesn’t immediately pick up when the economy starts accelerating because there is surplus capacity.But increasingly I get the sense that many industries are beginning to reach levels where they have to add capacity. When that happens capital investment will happen. Another pointer also mentioned in the Budget speech you may notice that our airlines have placed large orders for planes — that is capital expenditure.When you import 1,000 aircraft, it’s just not 1,000 aircraft, there are concomitant additions to ground handling facilities, you need airports to expand, you need to employ people to do that. That means a lot of jobs. The aircraft is capital but then look at the effect it is going to have on skilled jobs. So capital expenditure is happening. I am fairly confident that we will have decent capital expenditure in the year to come and that will become a new source of acceleration.",Finance secretary T V Somanathan says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047.

What is the Section 80C limit for tax deduction for FY 2024-25 after Interim Budget 2024?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/income-tax-budget-2024-2024-2025-section-80c-limit-epf-ppf-elss-nsc/articleshow/107353021.cms,"ALSO READ |

Income Tax Changes Budget 2024 : In the recent Budget 2024 speech, the Finance Minister kept the Section 80C tax deduction limit unchanged. The maximum limit for claiming tax benefits under Section 80C remains at Rs 1.5 lakh for the current fiscal year 2023-24 and will stay the same for individuals looking to save on taxes through Section 80C investments in the upcoming fiscal year 2024-25.Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions. Individuals can reduce their gross taxable income by up to Rs 1.5 lakh per financial year by engaging in these specific investments or expenditures.You can save on taxes through Section 80C by investing in things like Employees' Provident Fund (EPF), Public Provident Fund (PPF), Equity Linked Saving Scheme (ELSS) mutual funds, National Savings Certificate (NSC), and 5-year tax-saving fixed deposits with banks or post offices. Additionally, paying life insurance policy premiums also qualifies for tax benefits under Section 80C.It is important to note that each eligible investment comes with its specific maximum limit, rate of return, liquidity, and taxation rules for the earned returns, states ET in a report. For instance, the most you can invest in PPF in a financial year is Rs 1.5 lakh. Meanwhile, there's no limit on the amount you can invest in ELSS mutual funds, but the Section 80C deduction is capped at Rs 1.5 lakh.If individuals can't make specific investments, they can still get deductions under Section 80C from their gross taxable income through certain expenses. These expenses include repaying the principal amount of a home loan, tuition fees for children, payment of stamp duty, registration fees, and other costs related to buying a house.Since the financial year 2020-21, individuals without any business income must annually choose between the old and new tax regimes. As of the fiscal year 2023-24, the new tax regime is the default option. Consequently, individuals seeking tax deductions under Section 80C must opt for the old tax regime since this deduction isn't available in the new tax regime. It's crucial for taxpayers to be aware of these rules to make informed decisions about their tax planning and investment strategies.","Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget which is an interim budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year. The budget talks about inclusive development both, social and geographical, especially for youth, women, farmers, and the poor. Continued focus on improving logistics through infrastructure spend on roads, rail, airports, ports increases productivity for companies and citizens alike.To make ‘Viksit Bharat’ by 2047, the government’s focus is on improving and empowering people’s capabilities through various skilling initiatives. It is encouraging to see that Skill India Mission has succeeded in training more than 1.4 crore youth and upskilling and reskilling 54 lakh youth. I am particularly happy to see the continued focus on youth and women entrepreneurship and the announcement of a new fund which will give interest free 50 year loans for startups will provide a domestic fillip to startups supplementing venture capital we have traditionally relied on from abroad.PM Mudra Yojana has sanctioned 43 crore loans aggregating to 22.5 lakh crore to youth entrepreneurs and thirty crore Mudra Yojana loans to women entrepreneurs. There are several other schemes like Fund of Funds, Start-Up India, and Start-Up Credit Guarantee schemes that are assisting our youth. Further, the extension of tax benefits to Start-ups and investments made by sovereign wealth funds/pension funds, till 31st March 2025 depicts the government’s effort to support the startup eco- system.This aligns quite well with India Sanitation Coalition’s efforts to give impetus to the start-up world. Over the past 7 editions of our ISC-FICCI Sanitation Awards, we have recognized and promoted several start-ups in the sanitation space, many of whom are successful businesses now!While the finance minister did not provide detailed information on Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH), the budget allocation sees a slight increase in spend demonstrating continued focus on this highly successful program. The acknowledgement that the private sector has increasingly played a substantial role in addressing WASH issues in both urban and rural areas, with numerous projects underway through Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs), highlights the government's commitment to addressing challenges in this sector.A perfect example is the LightHouse Initiative initiated by the Department of Drinking Water along with the India Sanitation Coalition (ISC) by partnering with major corporates across India to develop model villages in Solid and Liquid Waste Management (SLWM) under SBM-Grameen. From this budget, there is an expectation that the government will persist in prioritizing Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) as the path toward achieving the country's Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6). Additionally, it is hoped that the government will uphold its commitment to making necessary infrastructural investments for SLWM.The budget speech rightly celebrates the fact that we have 83 lakh SHGs and 9 crore women beneficiaries. The microfinance movement in the country and the possibility of empowering women members of SHGs through livelihood skilling is a key to bringing women into mainstream economic advancement.The focus on green growth, rooftop solar, wind, biomass, e-vehicles all help with our green energy thrust. The tourism sector was mentioned and could be a huge job provider for youth and women.Guided by the principle ‘Reform, Perform, and Transform’, the budget emphasizes efficient implementation of various policies by improving coordination with states and relevant stakeholders. This is critical both for infra spend and social programsIt is noteworthy that ISC’s Climate Resilient Coastal Cities project which is being implemented in PPP (Public-Private Partnership) mode in four coastal states of Karnataka, Gujarat, Goa and Maharashtra is congruent with the government’s priority of promoting climate-resilient activities for the blue economy 2.0, a scheme for restoration and adaptation measures, and coastal aquaculture.The budget also focuses on the Aspirational districts program where assistance will be given to the states for faster development of aspirational districts and blocks, including the generation of ample economic opportunities. This is again very crucial as it has a huge potential to transform the landscape of our country while making sure no -one is left behind.Overall, this budget has embraced economic strategies and develops the building blocks that nurture and uphold growth, promote inclusive and sustainable development, and enhance productivity.","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year.

Patents Act to be amended to strengthen provisions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/patents-act-to-be-amended-to-strengthen-provisions/articleshow/110479476.cms,"NeEW DELHI: The department for promotion of industry and internal trade ( DPIIT ) will soon move amendments to the Indian Patents Act to strengthen provisions around disclosures related to use of traditional knowledge and genetic resources , while filing patent applications.

Last week, developing countries, including India, managed to secure a commitment for disclosure of traditional knowledge and genetic resources at the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO), with 15 countries already endorsing the treaty, dubbed as the first to address the issue that has been under discussion since 1999. It has faced resistance from the US and several developed countries, as well as large corporations.

A senior govt official told TOI that while the Indian law provides protection and has got several patent offices across the world to tap into the Traditional Knowledge Digital Library (TKDL) to check patents, the move to have a treaty will address the issue more comprehensively as only 35-odd countries have similar provisions.

DPIIT is seeking to move amendments to section 10 of the Indian Patent Act, while seeking cabinet nod for signing the agreement. ""Broadly, where a claimed invention in a patent application is based on genetic resources, each contracting party shall require applicants to disclose the country of origin or source of the genetic resources. Where the claimed invention in a patent application is based on traditional knowledge associated with genetic resources, each contracting party shall require applicants to disclose the Indigenous Peoples or local community, as applicable, who provided the traditional knowledge,"" WIPO said.

","The department for promotion of industry and internal trade ( DPIIT) will soon move amendments to the Indian Patents Act.

Sweden's EQT raises $1.6 billion for Asia fund,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/swedens-eqt-raises-1-6-billion-for-asia-fund/articleshow/110478870.cms,"MUMBAI: Sweden-based private equity firm EQT has closed a new $1.6 billion Asia-focused fund , and India is expected to get the largest share of capital allotment from it, the company said in response to queries. The PE firm raised more capital than its initial estimated target of $750 million.

EQT plans to bet on the healthcare , financial services and technology sectors in India and the market has bagged two of the fund's four investments so far. In Dec last year, EQT had acquired a majority stake in Chennai's Indium Software from existing shareholders . The broader strategy will be to invest in high-growth mid-market companies across Asia. Private markets in the region remain relatively underserved - in 2023 only 9% of the capital raised went to Asia-focused funds. ""This dedicated strategy aims to help address this financing gap. The region is the epicentre of global growth, expected to contribute 60% of global GDP by the end of 2024,"" EQT said in a statement .

Childhood sprinter from Chennai breaks tapes in Silicon Valley,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/childhood-sprinter-from-chennai-breaks-tapes-in-silicon-valley/articleshow/110444544.cms,"For a typical Chennai lad with salaried parents, entrepreneurship was not Rajesh C Subramaniam’s first calling. After a degree in electrical engineering from Annamalai University in 1992 and a masters in a US university, he took up the job of product development and customer relationships in 1994.The turning point came in 2003 when Atoga Systems, the company he was working with, was taken over. “I decided it was the right time to be on my own,” says Rajesh, 54, whose US-based company EmbedUR employs 360 people and provides services for global corporations and Fortune 500 companies.The CEO’s entrepreneurial journey is in a way defined by his experience in engineering and, along the way, learning trends of technology adoption. Studying in the US, he was attracted by the boom in the networking industry, startups and Silicon Valley’s hustle and bustle. He built testers for digital signals processors, then pivoted to network equipment at then Bay Networking, one of the pioneers of the networking equipment industry, in 1998. When he launched EmbedUR in 2004, his employer became his first customer.“In the first five to six years, I didn’t know what to do. Then our customers started guiding us. That happens when you build good relations with them,” says Rajesh.“Major companies look at industry trends ahead of time. You’ve to be agile enough to position yourself to be there,” he explains his growth mantra. The differentiating factors, he says, are courage to take risks and transition and the commitment to build.His company writes software for smaller IoT devices that makes them smart (smart devices). Its expertise lies across industries involving IoT like medical devices, automobiles and smart appliances. It also bets big on edge computing applications and builds smaller machine learning models optimised for specific purpose-built chips.EmbedUR has developed a small machine learning model for presence detection based on a larger image model, among other things. It does the computing on a palm-sized chip. Rajesh says bringing these capabilities on the chip from the cloud would bring down the cost and democratise smart devices. A hearing aid device with artificial intelligence-based noise filtering algorithm does the computing work in the small chip. “While there is a lot of excitement about large language models, on-device capabilities are crucial for time-sensitive places like medical badges, where connectivity issues could have serious complications,” he says.EmbedUR started engaging with major chip makers in 2011. These companies provide chips, but underlying code and management for particular applications needs to be built, and that’s where the company’s expertise comes in. “They call us and introduce us to their customers” Having access to cutting edge chipset vendors pushed him into the internet of things (IoT). About 300 of EmbedUR’s 360 employees are in Chennai. With a childhood background in athletics, acting and singing, Rajesh is in a race on a global stage.","Rajesh C Subramaniam, 54, is the CEO of US-based company EmbedUR.

How high will the price of KangaMoon go?

As Bitcoin recently gathered bullish momentum and surged beyond the $70,000 mark, other altcoins like Litecoin , Stellar , Avalanche and the new meme coin KangaMoon are also being propelled by this surge. Let us find out why.The Bitcoin price fought to stay over $70,000 on May 22 as Glassnode analysts speculated that the pioneer cryptocurrency was getting ready for a ""bigger move"" upward. Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView data indicate that following a protracted decline from all-time highs, the Bitcoin price has been rising steadily, as evident on the Bitcoin price chart.Glassnode reports that although most important on-chain measures are moving toward equilibrium, Bitcoin's recent recovery to $71,000 is the result of ""compression of volatility"" and easing sell-side pressure. Glassnode analysts saw a “large decline” in the one- and two-year cohorts over the past two months using the Supply Last Active Age Band indicator.In case Bitcoin keeps rising to $73,000, the Litecoin price may have upward momentum since it recently tested the bottom limit of the daily Ichimoku cloud. The lower limit of the Ichimoku cloud serves as an important support level, and keeping a position above it is necessary to keep a bullish trend going. Should the Litecoin price be able to penetrate the cloud, it may advance toward the $93 crucial resistance level.With further support around $85.70 as seen on the Litecoin price chart, the altcoin may go towards the major resistance level around $93. Maintaining the upward trend therefore depends on keeping above the cloud. A first line of protection for Litecoin is the 38.2% Fibonacci level at $85.09. Should this support be breached, the trend may be deteriorating and more selling pressure may be introduced.With the recent deployment of Protocol 21 by the Stellar (XLM) testnet, its main network made a major stride. A mainnet vote is planned for June 18, 2024, and this update includes important features like passkey signing and cheaper smart contract transactions. These improvements are meant to greatly increase the Stellar network efficiency and reduce running costs.Moreover, the continuous dedication of the Stellar network to increasing worldwide access to and affordability of financial services is reflected in Protocol 21. Stellar is carefully improving its infrastructure to support a larger, more inclusive financial ecosystem by putting CAPs 0054, 0055, and 0056 into place, while nevertheless keeping costs low for users worldwide. Amid these, the Stellar price has seen a notable rise by 3% to $0.11 per token within the past week.For weeks, the Avalanche price has stayed between $30 and $40. The Avalanche price dropped to the $35 area in March after rising above $60, and it has subsequently had difficulty breaking beyond the $40 barrier. Nonetheless, recent positive trends suggest that there may be a rally to retake the $40 mark.At $39.91, Avalanche has increased in its price by over 15% during the last week while the Avalanche market cap has also risen slightly by 0.65% to reach $15.68 billion. Moreover, the price of Avalanche might reach its March high of $60.69 if sentiment in the larger cryptocurrency market improves.Because of its presale performance, KangaMoon (KANG) has become more well-known to the general public amid the current meme coin craze. In addition, KANG has almost hit $7 million. Furthermore, there are presently over 32,000 registered KangaMoon users. The primary goal of KangaMoon is to profit from the Play-to-Earn (P2E) gaming market, which is expected to generate $8856 million by 2028.The group intends to develop a play-to-earn (P2E) game in which users may purchase items with KANG and level up their characters. KANG will gain from this development, and it will gain more than 99% of other hype-driven memecoins . The SocialFi aspect of KangaMoon is what distinguishes it from other projects.Put another way, prior to debut, KangaMoon is giving out free KANG based on how much people interact on its social media channels, which include Telegram and X. As a result, a large number of individuals are appreciating and sharing KangaMoon's social media content. Each KANG is currently valued at $0.025—400% higher than its initial pricing of $0.005—during the bonus stage of its presale.Analysts, however, predict that KANG might rise 100x after it is listed on a Tier-1 CEX like BitMart, which has announced the meme coin's listing. This might just be the start. Moreover, KangaMoon is already listed on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko. Considering that fans of cryptocurrencies are anticipating a sharp increase in value, KANG is among the best meme coins to buy now.Among the most promising memecoins, KangaMoon has already attracted the interest of numerous investors. Furthermore, because KangaMoon now has a small market capitalization, inflating the token's price is less expensive. Because of this, experts believe that after KANG is listed on BitMart , its price will soar above $1.Click here to know more.","The Bitcoin price fought to stay over $70,000 on May 22 as Glassnode analysts speculated that the pioneer cryptocurrency was getting ready for a ""bigger move"" upward.

Shipments to Russia jump but exporters are wary of sanctions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/shipments-to-russia-jump-but-exporters-are-wary-of-sanctions/articleshow/110445313.cms,"NEW DELHI: Russia's war with Ukraine and the consequent sanctions helped push the export of engineering goods , machinery and machine parts as well as aircraft spares from India during the last financial years, while traditional items such as pharmaceuticals, tea, coffee and tobacco stagnated or fell.While trade bodies say there is tremendous interest to import goods from India , the fear of sanctions and reluctance of banks to complete the transactions have made exporters wary of pushing their goods. But industry experts believe that some of the goods to Russia may be routed via UAE, which has significantly benefited from the tension in Ukraine and Russia.Thanks to massive oil imports, Russia has emerged as India's fourth largest trading partner with total trade estimated at $65.7 billion. After China, India had the second highest trade deficit with Russia, pegged at over $57 billion. Although there has been a buzz about recent moves to allow Russian exporters, who receive the payment in rupees, to invest more freely, the norms have always been there since RBI put in place the mechanism. There have also been several trade missions to explore export opportunities in Russia, some of which can use the rupee balances.But exporters are shy, arguing that banks are reluctant. ""Most Indian banks don't want to take up this business, fearing possible sanctions,"" said a large Indian exporter.While Russian entities such as SberBank are willing to route funds through their Indian branch, domestic players want to avoid these transactions. ""My advice to fellow exporters has been to route all exports through a small subsidiary so that the other parts of the business are not exposed to any sanctions,"" said another exporter, who has stopped all business with Russia for the last two years. A German buyer is, however, sourcing goods from this exporter and then exporting to Russia.Sectors such as auto components had seen a lot of interest post-sanctions but the exposure of Indian companies to American buyers and global car giants has seen them stay away.Latest official data showed that in 2023-24, exports to Russia climbed over 35% to $4.3 billion, when India's cumulative goods exports were more than 3% lower.

Tesla shareholders advised to decline Musk's $56 billion pay,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/tesla-shareholders-advised-to-decline-musks-56-billion-pay/articleshow/110431445.cms,"NEW DELHI: Glass Lewis , a proxy advisory firm , has advised Tesla shareholders to vote against a proposed $56 billion compensation package for CEO Elon Musk , which would be the largest pay package for a CEO in corporate America if approved.The firm cited several reasons for its recommendation, including the excessive size of the deal, the dilutive effect upon exercise, and the concentration of ownership.Additionally, Glass Lewis mentioned Musk's numerous time-consuming projects, which have expanded with his recent acquisition of Twitter, now known as X.The proposed pay package, put forward by Tesla's board of directors, has faced criticism for the board's close relationship with Musk. The package does not include a salary or cash bonus and instead ties rewards to Tesla's market value increasing to as much as $650 billion over a 10-year period starting from 2018.Currently, the company's market value stands at approximately $571.6 billion, according to LSEG data.Earlier this year, Judge Kathaleen McCormick of Delaware's Court of Chancery invalidated the original pay package. In response, Musk sought to change Tesla's state of incorporation from Delaware to Texas.Glass Lewis also expressed concern over this proposed move, stating that it offers ""uncertain benefits and additional risk"" to shareholders.Despite the proxy advisor's recommendation, Tesla has encouraged shareholders to reaffirm their approval of the compensation package.In a recent interview with the Financial Times, Tesla's board chair Robyn Denholm defended the pay package, stating that Musk deserves it due to the company's achievement of ambitious targets for revenue and stock price.Musk has been Tesla's CEO since 2008 and has played a significant role in improving the company's performance. According to an online campaign website, Vote Tesla, the company has gone from a $2.2 billion loss in 2018 to a $15 billion profit, and vehicle production has increased sevenfold.In addition to its recommendation against Musk's pay package, Glass Lewis advised shareholders to vote against the reelection of board member Kimbal Musk, the billionaire's brother. However, the proxy advisor recommended the re-election of former 21st Century Fox CEO James Murdoch.","Glass Lewis advised Tesla shareholders to vote against a proposed $56 billion compensation package for CEO Elon Musk.

"UAW files objection to Mercedes vote, accuses of intimidating workers",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/uaw-files-objection-to-mercedes-vote-accuses-of-intimidating-workers/articleshow/110411814.cms,"NEW DELHI: The United Auto Workers (UAW) has accused Mercedes of interfering with a union election at two factories in Alabama by intimidating and coercing workers to vote against unionization.The labor group filed an objection with the National Labor Relations Board ( NLRB ) seeking a new vote, alleging that the company engaged in an ""unlawful antiunion campaign"" that included discipline, captive audience meetings, and a general goal of coercing and intimidating employees.However, despite the alleged illegal anti-union campaign, over 2,000 Mercedes workers voted in favor of unionization.The UAW believes that in a fair election, where Mercedes is held accountable for following the law, workers will successfully unionize. The workers sought a fair opportunity to have a voice on the job and a say in their working conditions.Mercedes-Benz stated that more than 90% of team members participated in the election, with a majority indicating they are not interested in UAW representation for collective bargaining purposes. The company claims to have worked with the NLRB to adhere to guidelines throughout the election process and will continue to do so.The union's filing alleges that four pro-union employees were fired, and the company allowed anti-union employees to solicit support during work hours while prohibiting pro-union employees from doing the same. The company also required workers to attend anti-union meetings, displayed anti-union propaganda, and prohibited the distribution of union materials in non-work areas.Furthermore, the union claims that the company, or its representatives, polled workers about union support, suggested that voting for the union would be futile, targeted union supporters with drug tests, and ""engaged in conduct which deliberately sought to exacerbate racial feelings by irrelevant and inflammatory appeals to racial prejudice.""The NLRB will review the objections, and if it is determined that the employer's conduct affected the election, a new election could be ordered.","The United Auto Workers (UAW) has accused Mercedes of interfering with a union election at two factories in Alabama.

It had applied for an interim measure in this instance, which was given.""The Tribunal granted our request, confirming that disputes between the companies should be resolved in ICC arbitration, not in front of Russian courts,"" CEZ said.Gazprom did not immediately reply to a request for comment.On Wednesday, a Russian court ruling banned Austrian energy company OMV Gas Marketing and Trading GmbH from pursuing arbitration proceedings in Stockholm against Gazprom's exporting arm.The court threatened to fine OMV 575.2 million euros. OMV said it considered the Russian legal proceedings to be illegitimate.The Czech Republic was nearly completely dependent on Russian gas supplies, mostly through the Nord Stream pipeline and Germany, until 2022 when Russia reduced shipments as relations with the West deteriorated sharply.

"Fliers are freaking out over safety after Boeing, Singapore air mishaps",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/fliers-are-freaking-out-over-safety-after-boeing-singapore-air-mishaps/articleshow/110385984.cms,"A spate of high-profile airline accidents this year have left a lasting impression on the public.There was the fiery Japan Airlines runway collision on January 2, followed days later by the Boeing Co door-plug blowout . From lost wheels to a turbulent Singapore Airlines flight this week, the headline-grabbing events have left the flying public to wonder whether it’s still safe to fly.The reality, statistics show, remains that getting on a Boeing or Airbus SE jetliner is still exponentially safer than the drive to the airport. Last year, there wasn’t a single fatality among the 37 million commercial airline flights.While 2024 won’t match that record, it’s been an average year in terms of airline safety. Yet public perception remains jittery. US web searches for “flight safety” hit the highest level in March since October 2014, according to Google Trends.That year a decade ago was a particularly bad one for aviation fatalities. The disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 in March was followed by the shooting down of the same carrier’s Flight 17 over Ukraine in July and an AirAsia crash in December.The accidents this year have caused far fewer fatalities than in early 2014 or in 2019, when the second of two Boeing 737 Max flights crashed in March, killing 157 people in Ethiopia.Five people aboard a Japan Coast Guard turboprop lost their lives in early January when the plane ventured onto the runway path of an incoming Airbus A350. While nobody died in the Jan. 5 structural failure of a 737 Max 9 operated by Alaska Air Group Inc., the accident dealt a serious blow to Boeing’s credibility and to passenger confidence.Since then, a series of more minor incidents, from a Delta Air Lines Inc Boeing 757 losing a nose wheel to a United Airlines Holdings Inc. 737 Max skidding off a runway in Houston, have received widespread media coverage.On the flight from London to Singapore this week, a 73-year-old British man died from a suspected heart attack after the plane encountered severe turbulence.“There is reason for the public to be concerned but I think the concern is elevated because of the real focus that some news stations have given,” said John Goglia, an aviation safety expert and former member of the National Transportation Safety Board. “The wheel falling off the aeroplane never would have gone anywhere; in some local newspapers it may have been a one-inch column.”Indeed, government statistics indicate the US is having a fairly normal year.In the US, there were 11 accidents and incidents on commercial passenger or cargo flights in the first quarter, according to the NTSB database. That’s slightly above an average of 9.7 in the decade from 2010 to 2019. Serious cases stood at four in the quarter, slightly above the pre-Covid average of 3.3. The figures are based on cases the NTSB investigates, which include all accidents and only some incidents, so the numbers can vary.Meanwhile, the Federal Aviation Administration reported progress in one problem area. The rate of serious runway incursions in the first quarter decreased by 59% from the same period in 2023, a historically high year for such events. The current rate for 2024 is below the annual average of 0.31 per 1 million aircraft operations over the last decade, according to data provided to Bloomberg.“Aviation is the safest way to travel and that’s because we never take anything for granted,” said the FAA, which is responsible for airline safety in the US. “We are always looking for risk and ways to mitigate it.”The extended spotlight on Boeing has brought significant attention to the planemaker, with some fliers filtering out its 737 Max jets. Yet many of the incidents have occurred with older planes, and are more likely to be traced back to an airline maintenance or operational issue than the original design or build quality.“In this environment, any operational event no matter how routine can get outsize attention,” Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun said at the company’s May 17 annual meeting.Many of the events which have worried fliers this year, from landing gear collapsing to pilots overshooting runways, are classified as incidents rather than the more serious “accident,” which the International Civil Aviation Organization defines as involving a person being fatally or seriously injured, the aircraft sustaining damage requiring repairs or the aircraft going missing.That doesn’t mean there aren’t improvements to be made, according to Loren Groff, the chief data scientist at the NTSB. He pointed to the work being done to improve staffing and training for air-traffic controllers after some recent errors and near-collisions on runways.“Overall, it’s amazing that the US aviation system, and most of the world in general, can do something so complex so successfully,” Groff said. “Would I be afraid of aviation in any way? No, absolutely not.”","A spate of high-profile airline accidents have left a lasting impression on the public. US web searches for “flight safety’ hit the highest level in March since October 2014.
