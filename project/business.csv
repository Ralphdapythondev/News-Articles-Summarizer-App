West Bengal is experiencing a heatwave with temperatures soaring above 40°C on Friday, officially declaring the city to be under heatwave conditions.A video has surfaced on social media platforms of a news anchor Lopamudra Sinha , fainting during live news telecast.Addressing the video Sinha, took to her Facebook account and shared her health update with her followers.She said the incident happened on April 18, in morning while she was reading news live. “It was very hot… my blood pressure dropped. I was feeling unwell even before I fainted. I thought drinking water would help so I asked the floor manager for some,” she said in the video.Even though the studio had air conditioning, it didn't make much of a difference because it was very hot that day. The news anchor, who has been working for about 21 years, usually didn't keep water on her desk because she only had to read the news for about 30 minutes and could manage without taking a sip.However, on Thursday, things were different as Sinha really needed water during the live broadcast. “On Thursday, most of the news was in the general category which did not have any visuals to go with it. There were no bites. Had there been any visuals to run on live telecast, I could have used that break to drink water,"" Sinha said.

Congress slams BJP government for 'rolling back' pro-people schemes in Rajasthan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/congress-slams-bjp-government-for-rolling-back-pro-people-schemes-in-rajasthan/articleshow/109476722.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Congress on Sunday said its previous government in Rajasthan passed a series of visionary laws to meaningfully improve the quality of life of thousands in the state and asked why the current BJP dispensation is ""rolling back"" pro-people schemes . Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh posed the questions to Prime Minister Narendra Modi ahead of his rallies in Jalore and Banswara.""Why is the BJP Government rolling back the INC's pro-people schemes? Does the PM prioritise his businessmen friends over Rajasthan's rural communities? Why has ERCP not been designated a national project yet,"" Ramesh asked in a post on X.Elaborating on what he said were ""jumla details"", Ramesh said when the Congress was in power in Rajasthan, it passed a series of visionary laws that would meaningfully improve the quality of life of thousands in the state.""The Rajasthan Minimum Guaranteed Income Act, the addition of 25 extra days for MGNREGA (Rural) over and above the sanctioned 100 days, the Indira Gandhi Shahari Rojgar Yojana Act which guaranteed 100 days of employment to families residing in urban areas, the Rajasthan Platform Based Gig Workers (Registration and Welfare Act), and the Right to Health Act which provided universal health coverage - all these schemes provided crucial protections to vulnerable populations,"" he said.""Instead of these acts being implemented, we are now seeing a breakdown of governance since the BJP came to power in December 2023,"" the Congress leader alleged.At least 15.5 lakh pensioners in Rajasthan have not received their pensions since January this year due to ""verification"" issues, he claimed.The government also attempted to reduce health coverage from Rs 25 lakh under the Congress' Chiranjeevi Yojana to just Rs 5 lakh under the BJP's Ayushman Bharat, Ramesh said.""In their vindictiveness, why is the BJP government rolling back the INC's pro-people schemes? Does PM Modi's vision involve any protections for vulnerable populations in Rajasthan,"" he asked.The Congress leader further claimed that Rajasthan's Orans are under threat after the BJP passed a controversial amendment to the Forest Conservation Act (FCA) in 2023.""Orans are community forests that are a vital part of community life in Rajasthan. Traditionally seen as sacred, these forests are preserved and managed by rural communities and used for everything from grazing livestock to hosting social events and festivals,"" he said.Under the old FCA, any land that satisfied the dictionary definition of forest was covered by the Act, he said and added that the amended FCA aims to nullify this much-celebrated definition. Now, it will only apply to forests that have been declared or notified as a forest and those recorded in government records on or after October 25, 1980, Ramesh added.""While Orans were earlier protected under the Act, the amended law does not apply to them. They are now under threat of destruction because revenue records have marked them as wasteland, which is easily diverted for development projects,"" he said.""While the BJP government has recently notified Orans as 'deemed forests', locals point out that this is quite counterproductive -- communities will not only be stopped from accessing and conserving Orans, the notification also does not stop them from being given to companies for non-forest purposes. Why has the BJP government so brazenly stripped protection from Rajasthan's sacred Orans,"" Ramesh asked.He also asked why the Eastern Rajasthan Canal Project (ERCP) has languished for so long.""Villages in Rajasthan are struggling to meet their basic water needs and women have to walk several kilometres to get water,"" the Congress leader said.On July 7, 2018 and October 6, 2018, PM Modi had promised to the people of Rajasthan that the Eastern Rajasthan Canal Project (ERCP) will be given national project status, he said.This designation would have enabled the Centre to bear 90 per cent of the funding costs, he noted.After the Congress came to power in 2018, then-chief minister Ashok Gehlot wrote to the PM on six occasions, requesting him to fulfil his promise so that this essential infrastructure project could commence, Ramesh said.""Despite the PM's promises, the BJP not only denied national project status, but also refused to respond to any of Mr Gehlot's letters. Now, the BJP government has hastily pushed the project through before the election, at massive cost to the state exchequer,"" he alleged.Ramesh asked why the prime minister has failed to fulfil the promise he made to the people of Rajasthan.""Where is the 'Double Engine Sarkar' when Rajasthan really needs it,"" he said and asked the prime minister to break his ""silence"" on these issues.",Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh posed the questions to Prime Minister Narendra Modi ahead of his rallies in Jalore and Banswara.

Maldives' polls today a test of President Mohamed Muizzu's India policy too,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/maldives-sunday-polls-a-test-of-muizzus-india-policy-too/articleshow/109464698.cms,"NEW DELHI: Maldives will vote today in the country's 4th multi-party Parliamentary elections that will also put to the test for the first time President Mohamed Muizzu's hostile India policy , especially the decision to throw out Indian military personnel from the Indian Ocean archipelago.The Indian government is hoping that the main opposition and pro-India party - Maldivian Democratic party (MDP) - will win a majority, leading to an effective legislative oversight of executive power.Ahead of the voting, the leader of MDP and former foreign minister, Abdulla Shahid, told TOI his party is optimistic about winning as the Muizzu administration has failed in the past 5 months in both domestic and foreign policies and the Maldivian people are also seeing a regression of democratic values under his watch.Shahid said Muizzu came into office by ""mongering lies and hate"" and all development projects have been halted. ""Intimidation of employees in state owned companies has returned with a vengeance. Thousands of people from the opposition have been threatened with suspension and termination from their jobs. There are calls to restrict delivery of essential services based on political affiliation,"" said Shahid, also a former president of the UN General Assembly.""Waste and corruption is rampant. People are clearly seeing the regression of democratic values and principles under this administration. And we are confident that they will show their response in their vote tomorrow."" he added, while underlining the significance of strong legislative oversight.The supervision of the exercise of executive authority and ensuring it's accountable for the exercise of its powers is an important constituent of the law-making powers of the 93-member People's Majlis. While the MDP is hoping to retain majority, if not repeat its 2019 ""super majority"" of 65 seats that thinned out later because of large-scale defections, the ruling People's National Congress (PNC) alliance is stressing the significance of a majority in People's Majlis for the president's development initiatives. Significantly, Muizzu, whose party had benefited from MDP defections, ratified last week an anti-defection law which was passed by Parliament earlier this month.Often described as a pro-China leader, Muizzu defeated his MDP predecessor Ibrahim Solih last year in a presidential poll seen internationally as a face-off between India and China. His pro-China image has held since then as he jetted off to Beijing in January, becoming the first democratically elected Maldivian president to visit China before travelling to India, and signed a bagful of agreements, including for defence cooperation. This was preceded by his decisions to expel Indian troops, who operated Indian naval choppers for HADR activities, and to walk out of an agreement that allowed the Indian Navy to carry out hydrographic surveys in the Maldivian waters.In his campaign for the Parliamentary polls, Muizzu, who attained office on the back of an India Out campaign, has often tom-tommed his eviction of Indian military staff and made snide remarks about India like accusing his predecessor of taking orders from a ""foreign government"". A poor showing will likely be seen by many at least in India as a vote against his departure from what had come to be known as the Maldives' India First policy .",The Indian government is hoping that the main opposition and pro-India party - Maldivian Democratic party (MDP) - will win a majority.

APMC constructing a mall and five-star hotel is a scam: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/apmc-constructing-a-mall-and-five-star-hotel-is-a-scam-sc/articleshow/109448949.cms,"NEW DELHI: Success in business may be most Gujarati’s alter ego but the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee of Surat took it to the next level by constructing a mall and a five-star hotel on its land, which was acquired by Gujarat govt in the 1960s for the benefit of farmers.A Supreme Court bench of Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud and J B Pardiwala castigated Surat APMC for frittering away land meant for welfare of farmers.“This is a scam of the highest proportion. How could the APMC have used the surplus land for a mall and five-star hotel? Which law authorized it to take such a decision?”Appearing for APMC, senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi said it was APMC’s land and the committee was free to put it to proper use for revenue generation. “How can the Gujarat HC direct the state to take over the land and property of APMC?” The hotel lease holder through senior advocate Nidhesh Gupta said there was no irregularity in the grant of the lease to run the hotel.The bench remained unconvinced and said the HC passed the extreme order considering the level of irregularity in allotment of APMC land for a hotel and a mall. It dismissed the appeal of both the APMC and the leaseholder of the hotel.The HC bench of CJ Sunita Agarwal and Aniruddha Mayee on March 27 had ordered the state to take possession of APMC’s five-star hotel constructed on the market yard’s land. It also ordered a public auction of the property and directed authorities to deposit the amount to the state's market funds.The bench ordered action against erring officials and APMC members responsible for construction of the luxurious hotel, which violated the aims and objectives of the market yard, for which the govt had acquired about 14,000 sq mt land.The HC ordered the director of Agriculture, Marketing and Rural Finance to conduct inspection of ‘Krushi Bazar’ on allegations by a petitioner that shops in the mall were leased for sale of items like jewellery and clothes. It ordered closure of all activities in the mall that were not for the welfare of the farmers.The SC’s view found broader acceptance in the December 2019 report of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Agriculture. The Committee had severely criticized the way APMCs across India, except UP and Punjab, were managed and how they were acting in detriment to the benefit of farmers. It had recommended radical reform in APMC Act in the country.","A Supreme Court bench of Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud and J B Pardiwala castigated Surat APMC for frittering away land meant for welfare of farmers. “This is a scam of the highest proportion.

"Meet Vasuki Indicus, the ‘crocodile’ that was a 50ft snake",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/meet-vasuki-indicus-the-crocodile-that-was-a-50ft-snake/articleshow/109414059.cms,"NEW DELHI/ROORKEE: A fossil found in 2005 from Gujarat’s Kutch and believed till now to be that of a giant crocodile has turned out to be of one of the largest snakes that ever existed on Earth .The discovery of ‘ Vasuki Indicus ’ by scientists of IIT , Roorkee could prove to be a “jackpot” of information of the evolutionary process, continental shift and India’s vital link to origin of many species, especially reptiles, researchers say.According to Sunil Bajpai, chair professor in IIT-Roorkee’s department of earth sciences, this serpent measuring between 11m (36ft) and 15m (49.22ft) could have been even longer than the now extinct Titanoboa, which once lived in Colombia. The closest relatives of ‘Vasuki Indicus’, the study finds, are Titanoboa and python.Researchers said the large size of ‘Vasuki Indicus’, named after the mythical king of serpents usually depicted round the neck of Shiva and in reference to its country of discovery, would have made it a slow-moving, ambush predator akin to an anaconda.The study named, ‘Largest known madtsoiid snake from warm Eocene period of India suggests intercontinental Gondwana dispersal”, was published in ‘Scientific Reports’ on ‘Springer Nature’ platform on Friday.Bajpai and post-doctoral fellow Debajit Datta from IIT-Roorkee said the fossil of this snake recovered from the Panandhro Lignite Mine in Kutch dates back to Middle Eocene period, approximately 47 million years ago. During their exploration, the researchers discovered 27 well-preserved vertebrae that appear to be from a fully grown reptile. Its length makes it the the largest known madtsoiid snake, which thrived during a warm geological interval with average temperatures estimated at 28°C.On the finding which is as much scientific as much accidental, Bajpai said: “The fossil was found in 2005, but since I have been working on different other fossils, it went on the backburner. In 2022, we started re-examining the fossil. Initially, due to its size, I thought it was of a crocodile. But then we realised it was of a snake and it turned out to be the biggest in its family and possibly one of the biggest and similar to Titanoboa.”The scientists claim that comparing its inter-relationship with other Indian and North African madtsoiids, ‘Vasuki’ represents a now-extinct relic lineage that originated in India. Subsequent India-Asia collision led to intercontinental dispersal of this lineage from the subcontinent into North Africa through southern Eurasia. “Though this discovery we have been able to show that we have some of the most remarkable snakes in India as well as other species,” said Bajpai, who along with his fellow reserachers had also discovered the fossil of a plant-eating dinosaur believed to be 167 million years old, in Jaisalmer last year.","'Vasuki Indicus' could prove to be a ‘jackpot’ of information of the evolutionary process, continental shift and India’s vital link to origin of many species, especially reptiles.

NEW DELHI: Tihar jail administration on Saturday said that Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had stopped taking insulin months before his arrest and is on a basic anti-diabetes oral medicine.Tihar jail submitted Delhi CM 's health report to LG V K Saxena after he asked the director general of prisons for a factual report into the Aam Aadmi Party's allegations that Kejriwal was not being provided insulin in Tihar jail.As soon as the report came out, AAP leader and state education minister Atishi said the report has ""exposed"" the BJP's ""conspiracy"".""At the behest of the BJP, a conspiracy is underway to kill Kejriwal in jail. The chief minister has been taking insulin for 12 years, what is the problem for the Tihar administration to give insulin to him?,"" she asked.Kejriwal, who is being treated by a private doctor in Telangana for diabetes, ceased insulin intake several months ago.

Since April 1, he has been incarcerated in Tihar jail.Medical records from RML Hospital indicated that Kejriwal had not been prescribed insulin, nor was there any indication for its requirement, as per the Tihar report. Additionally, the report noted that the chief minister's health was evaluated by a medicine specialist on April 10 and April 15.According to the report, the Tihar administration wrote to AIIMS, requesting a diet plan for the AAP chief.

Additionally, Kejriwal is permitted to consume only 20 ml of oil per day in his meals.Furthermore, the Tihar administration mentioned that, according to a government circular, no referral can be made to any private hospital, despite Kejriwal's request for videoconferencing with his doctor.","Tihar jail submitted Delhi CM's health report to LG V K Saxena.

HC annuls marriage as couple fails to consummate it due to man's 'relative impotency',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hc-annuls-marriage-as-couple-fails-to-consummate-it-due-to-mans-relative-impotency/articleshow/109475197.cms,"MUMBAI: The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay High Court has annulled the marriage of a young couple that could not consummate it due to the man's ' relative impotency ', noting their agony of frustration cannot be ignored. A division bench of justices Vibha Kankanwadi and S G Chapalgaonkar in the judgment on April 15 also noted that this was a fit case to help ""young sufferers of marriage"" who could not connect with each other mentally, emotionally or physically.A 27-year-old man had approached the bench after a family court in February 2024 refused an application filed by his 26-year-old wife, seeking to annul the marriage on the admission stage itself.The high court in its order said the expression 'relative impotency' is a known phenomenon and is different from the normal impotency, which means the inability to copulate in general.Relative impotency broadly points to a situation where a person might be capable of having intercourse but incapable of performing it with the spouse.The court said there could be various physical and mental causes for such relative impotency.""In the present case, it can be easily gathered that the husband has relative impotency qua (towards) the wife. The reason for non-consummation of the marriage is this apparent relative impotency of the husband,"" the HC said.The high court said it could not ignore the fact that this was a matter concerning a young couple who faced the agony of frustration in the marriage.The man may have initially blamed his wife for non-consummation as he was hesitant to admit he had relative impotency towards her, it said.""However, subsequently, he candidly admitted the same, being satisfied with the fact that it would not put lifelong stigma on him. The relative impotency is somewhat different than the general notion of impotency and the acceptance of relative impotency would not brand him impotent in general parlance,"" the HC said.The couple got married in March 2023 but separated after 17 days. The couple said their marriage was not consummated.The woman claimed the man had declined physical relations with her.In her plea seeking for annulment of marriage filed before the family court, the woman said the man had 'relative impotency'.She said they could not connect with each other mentally, emotionally, or physically.The man initially filed an affidavit before the family court stating that the marriage was not consummated but blamed the woman for it.He later submitted a written statement admitting relative impotency.The man claimed he was unable to establish physical relations with his wife but otherwise he was normal. In the statement, he said he did not want any stigma that he was impotent in general.Following this, the wife filed an application seeking the family court to decide the divorce plea at the admission stage itself as per provisions of the Civil Procedure Code instead of conducting a trial.The family court, however, rejected the application claiming the man and woman had raised collusive claims.The HC bench quashed the family court order and annulled the marriage declaring it null and void.","The Bombay High Court has annulled the marriage of a young couple that could not consummate it due to the man's'relative impotency' A division bench of justices Vibha Kankanwadi and S G Chapalgaonkar in the judgment on April 15 noted that this was a fit case to help ""young sufferers of marriage"" who could not connect with each other mentally, emotionally or physically.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109475204,imgsize-146692,width-400,resizemode-4/109475204.jpg"

He also said the public should be made more aware of the cost and benefits of these freebies and that it is the responsibility of the government to educate the population on this.""I think this is ultimately a political issue and there has to be political consensus on this. The leadership has to be taken by the central government and the Prime Minister. I believe they must float a white paper and try to generate a consensus on this. ""Educate people on the pros, and cons of these giveaways or freebies ( and ensure) how we can put a restraint on that and how we can enforce it,"" the former RBI governor told PTI in a recent interaction.Subbarao said that in a poor country like India, it is incumbent on the government to provide some safety nets to the most vulnerable sections and also introspect as to how far they can be stretched, given the fiscal constraints. ""You should ask (if ) it is the best use of this money or we can do something better. So I think we should have a more informed and vigorous debate on freebies and how we can impose some restraint on political parties,"" he opined.On some of the states crossing FRBM limits, he said states and the central government should maintain fiscal discipline and the FRBM targets should be adhered to. To a query, Subbarao said that according to the IMF which has done a study, India needs to grow at the rate of 7.6 per cent consistently till 2047 for it to become a developed nation by 2047.""To maintain a growth rate of 7.6 percent per year for the next 25 years, a few countries have done it, China has done it, but the more difficult point is whether we can do it with all the challenges like climate change, geopolitics, the difficulty of globalisation. It is difficult to say,' Subbarao said. The former RBI chief said a developed nation will have four pillars- rule of law, strong state, democratic accountability and institutions.""We can't say we don't have them, neither can we say we have all of them. So these are the things that we have to nurture and develop,"" he said.

'Not surprised with arrest': Arvind Kejriwal’s wife reads his emotional message from jail

'My name is Arvind Kejriwal, and I am not a terrorist': Sanjay Singh shares Kejriwal's message from jail with wet eyes

NEW DELHI: Amid the ongoing row, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Sunday presented a letter in which the Director General of Tihar jail requested AIIMS hospital for a diabetologist the previous day, contradicting Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) claims of adequate medical provisions being available inside the jail for Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal .Party spokesperson and Delhi health minister Saurabh Bharadwaj accused the central government of being accomplice in a conspiracy to kill the incumbent CM by denying him adequate medical treatment inside Tihar jail.Taking to his official X handle, Bharadwaj posted a picture of the letter written by DG of Tihar jail to AIIMS and said ""Exposure! There was no diabetes specialist in the jail. After 20 days, a doctor from AIIMS was asked for yesterday. For so many days, Arvind Kejriwal has been saying that take me to a diabetes specialist and give me insulin . Till now the BJP government at the Centre was saying that there are specialists in the jail; what is the need for specialists from outside?""""The DG of Tihar jail yesterday wrote to AIIMS that they need a diabetologist. Today, the BJP government has been exposed in front of everyone. Till yesterday, they were saying that they have all specialists. Everything is available in the jail. There is a hospital, clinic, beds, and insulin. Everything is there and Arvind Kejriwal is lying,"" he said.""For the past 20 days, Arvind Kejriwal has been with them. He is diabetic. He is asking to meet a diabetologist, he is asking for insulin. A normal doctor, I don't know how he is there in jail, on his recommendations all these manipulations are being done and the elected CM of Delhi is being denied insulin,"" he added.Earlier, Bharadwaj had alleged that a conspiracy is being hatched to kill Kejriwal by pushing him towards 'slow death'""Overall, it was a conspiracy to finish Kejriwal so his multiple organ damage and when he comes out of jail after 2-4 months he goes for treatment of kidney, heart and other organs,"" he said.""Arvind Kejriwal has been suffering from diabetes for 20-22 years. He has been on insulin for 12 years. Once a patient goes on insulin, his sugar can be controlled only with insulin,"" he added.Meanwhile, the Tihar Jail administration on Saturday submitted its report regarding Kejriwal's health status to Delhi Lieutenant Governor. According to the report, Delhi CM was on insulin for diabetes control. The report also called it 'incorrect' to say that the chief minister was being denied insulin by jail authorities.Earlier on Friday, Kejriwal's council senior advocate Abhishek Singhvi said that the jailed CM has been denied insulin to control his blood sugar level since his arrest, terming it 'shocking' and 'alarming.'Previously, the Enforcement Directorate had claimed that Kejriwal, despite having type 2 diabetes, was purposefully eating food with high sugar intake like mangoes and sweets everyday to create grounds for a medical bail or shift to a hospital.However, Kejriwal refuted the central agency's claim in the court and asserted that the food he consumed was in conformity with the diet chart prepared by his doctor.Kejriwal was arrested by the ED on March 21 in connection with a money laundering probe relating to alleged irregularities in the now-scrapped Delhi excise policy 2021-22. The trial court, on April 15, extended the judicial custody of Kejriwal until April 2",Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) presented a letter in which the Director General of Tihar jail requested AIIMS hospital for a diabetologist the previous day.

"If Bengaluru stops saying 'yuck' to treated waste water, it'll never go thirsty: Experts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/if-bengaluru-stops-saying-yuck-to-treated-waste-water-itll-never-go-thirsty-experts/articleshow/109473216.cms,"BENGALURU: Back in 2016, Centre for Ecological Sciences (CES) of Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, figured a way for the IT hub to stay water surplus. On an average, 20.05 TMC (thousand million cubic feet) of water is required every year for domestic purposes, CES's technical report established. Of which about 16.04 TMC, about 80 percent, could be met just by treating sewage water, suggested the report.Add to this, the rain yield, which is about 14.80TMC a year and Bengaluru could easily meet its water needs, the report stated. Cut to 2023. Some apartment owners of Emmanuel Heights in Hosa Road, Sarjapur, proposed setting up a sewage treatment plant in October. Little did they know that it would take them almost six months to convince the others.""They all agreed only after the firm setting up the sewage treatment equipment put it in the agreement that they will buy all the treated water. Many people were adamant that not a drop of the treated water should be used inside the complex. Forget drinking, they did not even want the treated water for watering the plants, because they have the tulsi plant,"" said Gopidas, a software engineer at Amazon who resides at Immanuel Heights.S Vishwanath, Bengaluru's go-to man for water conservancy and director of Biome Environmental Solutions is a long-time advocate of treated wastewater for drinking. According to him, it is now all in the mind, as science has already shown that it is perfectly fine to drink treated wastewater.""People are finding it difficult to wrap their head around drinking what they consider sewage. All things said against it are mostly stemming out of ignorance. Science has already advanced far enough for us to drink treated wastewater without causing any health problems,"" Vishwanath told PTI.Little over 10 days ago, investment whiz Nithin Kamath, founder and CEO of Zerodha and Rainmatter Foundation, propped up Boson White Water, a Bengaluru-based firm that converts wastewater into potable water, stating that wastewater could be the part of the solution for Bengaluru's water shortage crisis , on X. Although some agreed with him, most were revulsed by the idea of drinking water that was once sewage.Replying to Kamath, people started saying, without any scientific backing, that treated water will have heavy metals or hormones and therefore is unfit for consumption. The concern also stemmed from the perception that sewage treatment plants are run in a very bad way.Vikas Brahmavar, one of the founders of the start-up Boson White Water, said they were deluged with calls after their promotional video forwarded by Kamath went viral.""In a day, we got more than 300 calls. We have been doing this for two years now, and at most we get a dozen calls every day,"" said Brahmavar to PTI.But Brahmavar said most of it again were attempts to reiterate that wastewater, treated or not, is smelly and dirty.""In these two years, we have come a long way. But we are yet to convince people to drink wastewater. It will take some more time to break through that psychological barrier. What people are failing to understand is that the moment we started depending on tankers for water supply, we are past the 'water is dirty' curve. Who knows where they get that water from,"" said Brahmavar.Vishwanath said people are also not realising that treated wastewater is already being consumed indirectly.He pointed out to the Lakshmi Sagara lake in Kolar, which is the first of 82 lakes in Kolar and Chikkaballapur districts to be filled with treated wastewater from an STP, as part of Koramangala-Challaghatta (KC) Valley project, in which the government plans to fill 134 lakes at the cost of Rs 1,342 crore.""The project is one of the first in India to formally use secondary treated wastewater at such large volumes to fill the tanks and river ecosystem and provide water for agricultural use,"" said Viswanath.He said his organisation, Biome Environmental Trust, did a study in June 2021 among the locals, mostly farmers, about the impact of the project, and found out that treated water-filled lakes and tanks increased the yields of borewells.""In Lakshmi Sagara, for instance, in three months of the lake being filled with treated wastewater, water level in open wells increased and in six months water level in borewells increased. Now, farmers here are cultivating throughout the year,"" he said.In the Biome report, the farmers that the researchers spoke to had confirmed that contrary to the negative assumptions earlier, which had delayed the project, they found that the effort had rejuvenated the depleted groundwater and that most are finding groundwater at 300 to 400 feet. Earlier it was difficult to find water even at 1,200 feet, they said, adding that they often dug between two to four borewells, due to previous ones failing to yield water.""In India, one estimate suggests that treated wastewater can annually irrigate about 1 to 1.5million hectares of land. I think proper hydrogeology and aquifer mapping studies need to be done to establish the impact on recharge better. ""But, this is the only way forward for us to cut down our dependence on rain. I also think if people start getting comfortable with non-potable uses, potable will follow. It's only a matter of time,"" said Viswanath.",Bengaluru has a water shortage of 20.05 TMC (thousand million cubic feet) per year. About 80 percent of this can be met by treating sewage water.

How many Bitcoin halving are left?

The world of cryptocurrency witnessed another significant event as Bitcoin underwent its latest ""halving"" on Friday, effectively halving the mining reward and potentially influencing the currency’s future market dynamics. This pre-programmed adjustment occurs every four years and is critical for managing Bitcoin's supply. Following the event, Bitcoin's price remained relatively stable at approximately $63,907.With the reduction in new Bitcoin production, various implications arise for miners and the overall market, stirring both concerns and expectations among investors and analysts.Here is all you need to knowBitcoin ""halving"" is an automatic adjustment to the reward miners receive for verifying transactions and adding them to the blockchain. Initially set to distribute 50 bitcoins per block, this reward halves every 210,000 blocks. The latest halving reduced the reward from 6.25 to 3.125 bitcoins per block. This mechanism ensures that the total supply of Bitcoin caps at 21 million, a design to introduce scarcity, akin to precious metals like gold.Miners face a direct impact from halving as their earnings from rewards drop by 50%, which can significantly affect their profitability. Given the high costs associated with mining—such as electricity and hardware—reduced rewards mean that only the most efficient mining operations can sustain profitability. This could lead to increased consolidation in the industry, where only key players survive, potentially increasing the centralization of mining operations.Historically, halving events have preceded substantial increases in Bitcoin’s price. For instance, post-2020 halving, Bitcoin's price surged nearly seven-fold by the following year. However, experts like Adam Morgan McCarthy caution that past performance may not reliably predict future results, and other market conditions also heavily influence prices. Analysts remain divided, with some predicting significant rallies and others cautioning that the effects of halving might already be priced into the market.Beyond its impact on mining and prices, halving is viewed as a measure to preserve Bitcoin's value over time by controlling inflation. This scarcity mechanism is crucial for Bitcoin’s proposition as 'digital gold'. However, the reduced supply can also exacerbate price volatility in response to fluctuating demand.Environmental impact directly related to bitcoin halving remains somewhat uncertain. However, it is a well known fact that crypto mining consumes a significant amount of energy, with operations relying on polluting sources.The profitability pressures could push miners towards cheaper, potentially less environmentally friendly energy sources unless countered by technological advancements and regulatory measures.A recent study conducted by the United Nations University and published in Earth's Future journal revealed that the carbon footprint of bitcoin mining across 76 countries in 2020-2021 was equal to the emissions generated by burning 84 billion pounds of coal or operating 190 natural gas-fired power plants. The study found that coal accounted for the majority of bitcoin's electricity requirements (45%), followed by natural gas (21%) and hydropower (16%).There are expected to be 64 Bitcoin halvings before the 21 million cap is reached sometime around 2140 At that point, halvings will cease and the blockchain will stop issuing new tokens.(With inputs from agencies)","Bitcoin underwent its latest ""halving"" on Friday, effectively halving the mining reward.

Russia warns Pakistan of banning rice imports over phytosanitary concerns,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/russia-warns-pakistan-of-banning-rice-imports-over-phytosanitary-concerns/articleshow/109477207.cms,"KARACHI : Russia has warned Pakistan that it would ban rice imports again if Moscow's phytosanitary concerns are not addressed in future consignments after a quarantine organism was detected in the rice consignment. The warning came after Russia's Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance (FSVPS) issued a notification regarding violations of international and Russian phytosanitary requirements over a shipment of rice imported from Pakistan.Dated April 2, the notification highlights the presence of a quarantine organism, ""Megaselia scalaris (Loew),"" in the rice consignment.Pakistan's trade representative at its embassy in Russia was asked to carry out an immediate investigation into the matter.The Russian authorities have written to the Pakistan embassy to prevent such violations and ensure all Pakistani rice exporters follow phytosanitary standards to ensure the safety of agricultural products traded between the two countries.The trade wing of the Pakistani embassy in Moscow, while forwarding the Russian authority's letter to the Department of Plant Protection (DPP) in the Ministry of Food Security and other relevant government offices, has warned of a possible ban on rice exports in future if more complaints were received from Russian authorities.Russia had previously imposed a ban on rice imports from Pakistan in 2019 because of health safety reasons.Similarly, in December 2006, Russia stopped the import of rice from Pakistan for not meeting food safety standards.Chairman of the Pakistan Rice Exporters Association, Chela Ram Kewlani, said that Pakistani rice exporters needed to be very careful in choosing and packaging all rice for export.He said that Pakistan had benefited from India banning exports of non-Basmati rice last year, given that India has a nearly 40 per cent share in the globally traded rice.Last year, India banned the export of white non-Basmati and parboiled rice.According to a leading Pakistani rice dealer, about 700,000 tonnes of rice were exported in December 2023 alone, the highest in a month for the fiscal year.He said Pakistan exported rice with an increase in higher production and demand and elevated global prices last year.The Rice Export Corporation is projecting a 60 per cent jump in exports of Basmati rice to over a million tonnes and a 36 per cent jump for non-Basmati rice to 4.25 million tonnes from Pakistan.It is eyeing exports of above five million metric tonnes of all rice in the fiscal year of 2023/2024, which would be much higher than last fiscal year's exports of 3.7 million tonnes.",Russia has warned Pakistan that it would ban rice imports again if Moscow's phytosanitary concerns are not addressed in future consignments.

Floating fortresses: US navy to convert oil rigs into mobile military bases,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/floating-fortresses-us-navy-to-convert-oil-rigs-into-mobile-military-bases/articleshow/109476009.cms,"NEW DELHI: The US Navy has embarked on an innovative yet contentious project to transform surplus oil rigs into mobile missile defense and resupply bases in response to escalating missile threats in the Pacific, particularly from China. This initiative, developed by Gibbs & Cox, a Leidos company, was unveiled at the Sea Air Space 2024 expo in Washington DC.The Mobile Defense/Depot Platform (MODEP) concept is designed to convert oil platforms into large floating island bases that can operate independently for over 12 months, positioned at an ideal distance from shore.The converted platforms will potentially play a dual role in enhancing US air defense capabilities or aiding in strike missions, with the capacity to hold up to 512 vertical launch system (VLS) cells or 100 large missile launchers. This capability is about five times that of an existing Arleigh Burke-class destroyer, according to Naval News.Heruningtyas Desi Purnamasari, an official at the US Navy, outlined the strategic importance of these floating bases, noting, ""The platforms could conceivably lead to a substantial reduction in risks and costs associated with land-based defense systems.""The concept also includes plans for these mobile platforms to support the sustainment of the US Navy’s surface combatants and nuclear submarines through an Afloat Forward Staging Base configuration, offering a cost-effective solution at only 10% of the price of a new build Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) system.However, the feasibility of such floating bases has been a topic of debate. In 2018, experts Jose Delgado and Eviya Vitola discussed the political and security challenges of creating semi-permanent offshore military bases, noting their high costs, vulnerability to missile attacks, and relative ineffectiveness compared to conventional capabilities.More recently, Sam Tangredi of the Foreign Policy Research Institute highlighted the strategic advantages of sea bases, which include enhanced joint command capabilities and rapid strike potential. Tangredi also questioned whether new sea-basing technologies could keep pace with evolving anti-access/area-denial (A2/AD) threats, suggesting that while improvements in air and missile defenses might mitigate some risks, the practicality of investing heavily in sea bases remains uncertain.This ambitious project reflects a shift in military strategy as the US adapts to new geopolitical realities and technological advancements in warfare, aiming to bridge the gap between sea and land-based BMD capabilities effectively.","The US Navy has embarked on an innovative yet contentious project to transform surplus oil rigs into mobile missile defense and resupply bases.

"Climate Change Blamed for Dubai Floods, Not Cloud Seeding",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/climate-change-blamed-for-dubai-floods-not-cloud-seeding/articleshow/109408915.cms,"TOI

NEW DELHI: Many wondered whether it was cloud seeding - a weather modification technique to induce rains - that led to flooding of Dubai, but scientists involved in such projects in India categorically dismissed any link, and meteorologists and climatologists rather blamed climate change for the record precipitation in arid West Asia.Since parched UAE periodically conducts cloud seeding to increase level of its dwindling groundwater, extreme rainfall between Monday night and Tuesday evening raised questions on the artificial rain mechanism.The country received a record 255 mm of rain in less than 24 hours, flooding Dubai.Though it rained heavily in neighbouring Qatar, Oman, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia as well, Dubai in UAE faced the maximum impact.IIT Kanpur professor Sachchida Nand Tripathi, who is closely involved with the cloud seeding project in India said, there was no connection between cloud seeding and the floods in Dubai. “Seeding is tried at an early stage of storm development. In this case when the system progressed from the Gulf of Oman it was already an intensified storm. It is highly unlikely and unsafe to seed such systems. Seeding can at max contribute to 25% enhancement in rainfall. In this case the total rainfall was 25 cm. So even without seeding 20 cm of rainfall would have happened,” Tripathi toldEven distinguished climate scientist and former secretary in the ministry of earth science (MoES), Madhavan Rajeevan, dismissed the possibility of any link, saying cloud seeding cannot trigger such heavy rainfall and floods.Asked about likely reasons, he said, “This is absolutely a clear signal of climate change. It was a huge thunderstorm caused by a synoptic system which was moving across the Gulf region. With global warming there is now a tendency that if it rains, it rains very heavily. We should expect this kind of events more frequently in any part of the world and at any time.”Former chief of India Meteorological Department (IMD), K J Ramesh, too believed that cloud seeding was not the primary cause for the downpour. “Western disturbance-triggered extreme rainfall event development is the primary cause of the floods in the region,""he said.On its link with climate change, Ramesh said, “It is well known that any rain bearing system will become stronger under changing climate - global warming regime as warming enables atmospheric clouds to hold extra moisture and grow bigger and bigger leading to enhanced intensity of rain bearing systems.”Elaborating on the weather phenomena, he said, “Southward extension of passing westerly wave trough, supported by additional moisture feed from Arabian Sea, basically caused extreme weather events, causing unprecedented quantum of rainfall over not only UAE but also over Oman, north Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar.""Prior to this, a similar westerly wave gave heavy rainfall spells for two days over Afghanistan, leading to floods, thunderstorms and lightning over Pakistan”.On the UAE’s cloud seeding project, Ramesh said the country through its Rainfall Enhancing Experiment, launched in 2002, has been trying to carry out aircraft based cloud seeding as and when rain bearing weather systems develop over the surrounding regions. “Through such efforts, the cloud seeding team was able to enhance the quantum of rainfall up to 15% over and above the rainfall otherwise occurring any way naturally.”","The country received a record 255 mm of rain in less than 24 hours, flooding Dubai. Scientists involved in such projects in India categorically dismissed any link. Meteorologists and climatologists rather blamed climate change for the record precipitation in arid West Asia.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109410099,imgsize-55300,width-400,resizemode-4/109410099.jpg"

The outbreak of bird flu in cow has affected at least 13 herds in six states, as per the New York Times.The reports of sick cows began to emerge in Texas and New Mexico. Dead birds were also found on some of these farms, and laboratory testing confirmed that some cows were infected with bird flu.Earlier this month, US authorities reported a case of a person recovering from bird flu after exposure to infected cattle on a Texas dairy farm.""The case in Texas is the first case of a human infected by avian influenza by a cow,"" said Wenqing Zhang, head of the global influenza programme at the World Health Organization.""Bird-to-cow, cow-to-cow and cow-to-bird transmission have also been registered during these current outbreaks, which suggest that the virus may have found other routes of transition than we previously understood,"" she told a media briefing in Geneva.This incident marks only the second case of human infection with bird flu in the United States, following illnesses in herds apparently exposed to wild birds.""Now we see multiple herds of cows affected in an increasing number of US states, which shows a further step of the virus spillover to mammals,"" Zhang said.""The virus has also been detected in milk from infected animals.""Zhang said there was a ""very high virus concentration in raw milk"", but experts were still investigating exactly how long the virus is able to survive in milk.The Texas health department assured that infected cattle do not pose a threat to the commercial milk supply since dairies are mandated to discard milk from sick cows, and pasteurization effectively kills the virus.""It is important for people to ensure safe food practices, including consuming only pasteurised milk and milk products,"" said Zhang.(With inputs from agency)","The World Health Organisation (WHO) on Friday announced that the H5N1 bird flu virus strain had been found in significant quantities in raw milk from infected animals.

Indian-origin men involved in Canada's largest-ever gold and money heist,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/indian-origin-men-involved-in-canadas-largest-ever-gold-and-money-heist/articleshow/109415390.cms,"It was a brazen theft: thousands of gold bars and millions of dollars in bank notes stolen a year ago from Toronto's international airport.Canadian and US authorities said on Wednesday six people, including two Indian-origin men , have been arrested and three more are being sought in connection with what they called the largest gold heist in Canadian history - a cargo of over C$22 million ($16 million) in gold and currency.The arrests were announced after a long-year investigation under Project 24K. The suspects, including two Air Canada employees, forged an airway bill to steal a cargo arriving from Switzerland of C$20 million-worth 6,600 gold bars weighing 400 kg and C$2.5 million in foreign currency, police officials said. The gold was melted down and used to purchase illegal firearms. ""This story is a sensational one and which probably, we jokingly say, belongs in a Netflix series,"" said Nishan Duraiappah, chief of Peel police, responsible for law enforcement at Toronto airport .The gold theft appeared to be remarkably simple. The gold and cash arrived at the Toronto airport in a special container aboard an Air Canada flight from Switzerland on April 17, 2023, and it was moved to one of the airline's warehouses. The container held gold bars that were destined for a Toronto-based bank and bank notes bound for a currency exchange. About two hours later, a truck driven by a man who was arrested in Pennsylvania pulled up at the warehouse. The man carried a waybill - a document usually issued by a carrier with details about a shipment - that gave him access to the warehouse. It was actually a duplicate of a waybill, printed on an Air Canada printer, for a shipment of seafood that had been picked up a day earlier. The container with the gold bars and bank notes was loaded into the truck. Video recordings showed the truck travelling down Canada's busiest highway before eventually disappearing from sight in a rural area west of the city.Peel police officers were called early the next morning after an armoured truck of Brinks, an American cash handling company, arrived with the actual waybill for the shipment of gold and bank notes. Canada police said Wednesday that they believe the gold bars, which had serial numbers, were all melted down and that they had seized smelting pots. The only gold recovered, police said, was six bracelets made out of C$89,000 worth of gold.Air Canada employee Parmpal Sidhu, 54, from Brampton, Ontario, jewellery store owner Ali Raza, 37, from Toronto, Amit Jalota, 40, an Oakville, Ontario resident, Ammad Chaudhary, 43, from Georgetown, Ontario and Prasath Paramalingam, 35, from Brampton are among those that have been arrested. According to a PTI report, Sidhu and Jalota are of Indian origin. Police are searching for former Air Canada manager Simran Preet Panesar, 31, from Brampton as well as Archit Grover, 36, from Brampton and Arsalan Chaudhary, 42, from Ontario.Peel detective sergeant Mike Mavity said the truck driver that allegedly picked up the gold, Durante King-Mclean, a 25-year-old from Brampton, is currently in custody in the US. Sixty-five illegal firearms were found in his possession, two of which had been modified to have fully automatic capabilities.They were allegedly destined to be smuggled into Canada.

Trump's Save America Group spends big on legal fees; falls behind Biden at fundraising,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-group-spends-big-on-legal-fees-biden-leads-at-fundraising/articleshow/109473387.cms,"with input from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Donald Trump's political campaign group, disclosed spending 3.6 million US dollars on lawyer fees in February. Trump, currently facing four criminal trials, is aggressively campaigning to challenge Biden in the upcoming presidential election on November 5. The Save America group , which handles Trump's legal expenses and reported the expenditures to the Federal Election Commission, relies heavily on contributions from small donors .Although Save America managed to cover its expenses through a 5 million US dollar refund from a super PAC linked to Trump's campaign, it has now retrieved over $52 million out of the $60 million previously allocated to the PAC. This retrieval reportedly has significantly reduced the amount of funds available for television advertisements supporting Trump's campaign.Trump's legal battles include charges related to falsifying business records to conceal payments to a porn star, attempting to overturn his defeat to Biden in the 2020 election, mishandling classified documents post-presidency, and appealing a substantial civil fraud judgment. Moreover, financial challenges are looming over Trump's political operations, as shown in recent disclosures to the Federal Election Commission.Despite raising $15 million in March, Trump's campaign continues to trail Biden in fundraising, with Biden's campaign amassing over $43 million and holding $85 million in reserves, compared to Trump's $45 million.While campaign contributions are crucial for activities such as advertisements, staffing, and rallies, they do not solely determine the election outcome.Trump, who was outpaced by Hillary Clinton in fundraising during the 2016 election, still emerged victorious. Despite a decline in contributions from small donors, Trump has intensified efforts to attract major donors in recent weeks, aiding the Republican Party in raising over $20 million in March.MAGA Inc, the super PAC supporting Trump, closed March with $33 million in reserves, while Future Forward, the primary Democratic super PAC backing Biden, reported over $41 million in funds.","Donald Trump's political campaign group, disclosed spending 3.6 million US dollars on lawyer fees in February.

Will there be a 'superbloom' this year in California?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/will-there-be-a-superbloom-this-year-in-california/articleshow/109473197.cms,"NEW DELHI: The vast deserts of Southern California , the dramatic bluffs of the Bay Area, and even the areas near Los Angeles International Airport are starting to be covered in carpets of yellow, orange, and gold flowers However, the question remains: do these blooms qualify as a "" superbloom ""? The term lacks a single definition, and this year's blooms have not been as vibrant or abundant as those that blanketed parts of California last spring following drought-busting rains, despite the state receiving ample winter rains this year as well.After particularly wet winters, bursts of color may appear in the spring, attracting throngs of visitors to California and other parts of the Southwest to witness the flowering fields and capture photographs. Scientists do not agree on a single definition of a superbloom. In California and Arizona, there are areas of desert that can quickly transform into dense fields of wildflowers , as seeds lie dormant in the soil and then germinate and blossom at around the same time.According to Naomi Fraga , director of conservation programs at the California Botanic Garden , this year's blooms do not qualify as a superbloom due to the lack of huge diversity in the flowers that have blossomed in places like California's Death Valley. The wildflower display this year, while still beautiful, is not as large or dense as in past years. Evan Meyer, executive director of the California-based nonprofit Theodore Payne Foundation, believes that whether this year's blooms constitute a superbloom is ""really in the eye of the beholder.""April is typically the peak month for spring wildflowers, but in high-elevation places, they can continue to blossom later into the spring. Superblooms generally refer to low-elevation desert regions, and the timing is more geographic than seasonal. When temperatures rise in the desert, the flowers can quickly dry out. The effects of climate change on wildflowers could play out over decades or even centuries, as seeds stay dormant in the soil for long periods of time. Southern California's unusual heavy rain last summer and higher than average winter temperatures have contributed to an unusual bloom this year.","After particularly wet winters, bursts of color may appear in the spring.

Artificial Intelligence has a measurement problem,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/artificial-intelligence-has-a-measurement-problem/articleshow/109468730.cms,"SAN FRANCISCO: There's a problem with leading artificial intelligence tools such as ChatGPT, Gemini and Claude: We don't really know how smart they are. That's because, unlike companies that make cars or drugs or baby formula, AI companies aren't required to submit their products for testing before releasing them to the public.Users are left to rely on the claims of AI companies, which often use vague, fuzzy phrases like ""improved capabilities"" to describe how their models differ from one version to the next.Models are updated so frequently that a chatbot that struggles with a task one day might mysteriously excel at it the next. Shoddy measurement also creates a safety risk. Without better tests for AI models , it's hard to know which capabilities are improving faster than expected, or which products might pose real threats of harm.In this year's AI Index - a big annual report put out by Stanford University's Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence - the authors describe poor measurement as one of the biggest challenges facing AI researchers. ""The lack of standardized evaluation makes it extremely challenging to systematically compare the limitations and risks of various AI models,"" said editor-in-chief, Nestor Maslej.For years, the most popular method for measuring AI was the Turing Test - an exercise proposed in 1950 by mathematician Alan Turing, which tests whether a computer program can fool a person into mistaking its responses for a human's. But today's AI systems can pass the Turing Test with flying colors, and researchers have had to come up with harder evaluations.One of the most common tests given to AI models today - the SAT for chatbots, essentially - is a test known as Massive Multitask Language Understanding, or MMLU.The MMLU, which was released in 2020, consists of a collection of roughly 16,000 multiple-choice questions covering dozens of academic subjects, ranging from abstract algebra to law and medicine. It's supposed to be a kind of general intelligence test - the more a chatbot answers correctly, the smarter it is.It has become the gold standard for AI companies competing for dominance. (When Google released its most advanced AI model, Gemini Ultra , earlier this year, it boasted that it had scored 90% on the MMLU - the highest score ever recorded.)Dan Hendrycks, an AI safety researcher who helped develop the MMLU while in graduate school at the University of California, Berkeley, said that while he thought MMLU ""probably has another year or two of shelf life,"" it will soon need to be replaced by different, harder tests. AI systems are getting too smart for the tests we have now, and it's getting more difficult to design new ones.There are dozens of other tests out there - with names including TruthfulQA and HellaSwag - that are meant to capture other facets of AI performance. But these tests are capable of measuring only a narrow slice of an AI system's power. And none of them are designed to answer the more subjective questions many users have, such as: Is this chatbot fun to talk to? Is it better for automating routine office work, or creative brainstorming? How strict are its safety guardrails?There is a problem known as ""data contamination,"" when the questions and answers for benchmark tests are included in an AI model's training data, essentially allowing it to cheat. And there is no independent testing or auditing process for these models, meaning that AI companies are essentially grading their own homework. In short, AI measurement is a mess - a tangle of sloppy tests, apples-to-oranges comparisons and self-serving hype that has left users, regulators and AI developers themselves grasping in the dark.""Despite the appearance of science, most developers really judge models based on vibes or instinct,"" said Nathan Benaich, an AI investor with Air Street Capital. ""That might be fine for the moment, but as these models grow in power and social relevance, it won't suffice."" The solution here is likely a combination of public and private efforts.Governments can, and should, come up with robust testing programs that measure both the raw capabilities and the safety risks of AI models, and they should fund grants and research projects aimed at coming up with new, high-quality evaluations.In its executive order on AI last year, the White House directed several federal agencies, including the National Institute of Standards and Technology, to create and oversee new ways of evaluating AI systems."," AI companies aren't required to submit their products for testing before releasing them to the public.

NEW DELHI: Ahead of the upcoming parliamentary elections in the Maldives, opposition parties are calling for an investigation and possible impeachment of President Mohamed Muizzu in response to a leaked report dating back to 2018 alleging corruption.The parliamentary elections for the Majlis are scheduled for Sunday, ahead of which, the opposition Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) and President Muizzu 's People's National Congress (PNC) have engaged in trading barbs and accusations against each other.The political turmoil began when an anonymous individual using the handle 'Hassan Kurusee' shared leaked intelligence reports on social media, which included documents from the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) of the Maldives Monetary Authority and the Maldives Police Service. These reports purportedly linked President Muizzu to financial misconduct, citing irregularities in money transfers to his personal bank account and suggesting possible involvement with politically exposed individuals, embezzlement, structured transactions, and the use of corporate entities to conceal fund origins.The allegations sparked a firestorm of reactions on social media, with demands from the MDP and People's National Front (PNF) for an official investigation into the matter. Former vice president Dr Mohamed Jameel Ahmed went a step further, calling for President Muizzu's impeachment based on the leaked intelligence reports. Jameel emphasized the importance of accountability in governance and urged President Muizzu to cooperate with independent investigations into the allegations, including those related to the Ras Male' development project and alleged excessive spending on public relations.President Muizzu responded to the corruption allegations on Tuesday, asserting that the opposition's attempts to implicate him were baseless and driven by desperation.

The NIA appealed his sentence and is seeking the death penalty.Overseas Friends of BJP UK president Kuldeep Shekhawat told TOI that this move by the Labour MP “is unacceptable as JKLF is a banned organisation in India” and that “this proves Labour’s continued support to extremism and policy of interference in India’s internal affairs”,Vinod Tikoo, volunteer at the Jammu Kashmir Study Centre UK, told TOI: “Rubaiya Sayeed, daughter of former Union home minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed, who was kidnapped in 1989 in Kashmir, has identified Yasin as the person who kidnapped her. For an MP to host Yasin’s sympathisers in the UK Parliament is murder of democracy.”Friends of India Society International UK said: “It’s appalling to see a British parliamentarian sympathising and intentionally disregarding the multitude of facts regarding Yasin Malik and his terror-affiliated organisation, JKLF, to cater to vote-bank politics.”Indian Kashmiri Muslim Javed Beigh wrote on X: “Yasin Malik stands accused of initiating a violent, bloody, Islamist separatist movement at the behest ofPakistan in early 1990s which… completely destroyed Indian ethnic Kashur-speaking Kashmiri society. Please desist from using our misfortune to further your political career.”",Luton South MP Rachel Hopkins met with members of Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front.

WHO says wider alert on contaminated J&J cough syrup 'likely',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/who-says-wider-alert-on-contaminated-jj-cough-syrup-likely/articleshow/109436549.cms,"LONDON: The World Health Organization is likely to issue a wider warning about contaminated Johnson and Johnson-made children's cough syrup found in Nigeria last week, it said in an email.Nigeria's regulator recalled a batch of Benylin syrup last Wednesday, having found a high level of diethylene glycol in the product during routine testing.The contaminant, alongside another closely related toxin, has been linked to the deaths of more than 300 children in Gambia, Uzbekistan, Indonesia and Cameroon since 2022, though there is no evidence that these incidents are linked with the new recalls.The U.N. health body said it puts out global medical product alerts to ""encourage diligence"" by national authorities and was likely to do so in this instance, ""subject to confirmation of certain details from parties"".The batch of Benylin syrup recalled was made by J&J in South Africa in May 2021, although Kenvue now owns the brand after a spin-off from J&J last year.J&J has referred requests for comment to Kenvue. Kenvue was not immediately available for comment, but said this week it was conducting its own assessment and working with health authorities to determine a course of action.Since Nigeria's recall, five other African countries have also pulled the product from shelves - Rwanda, Kenya, Tanzania, Zimbabwe and South Africa, where the drug was made.South Africa’s regulator has also recalled another batch of the syrup, which is used to treat coughs, hay fever and other allergic reactions in children.Diethylene glycol is toxic to humans when consumed and can result in acute kidney failure, although there have been no reports of harm in the latest incident.In the 2022 cases, the contamination in the syrups came from the raw materials used by manufacturers in India and Indonesia.The WHO said it was collaborating with both the manufacturer and regulatory authority in South Africa to investigate this for the Benylin paediatric syrup, and had information on the source of the raw ingredients used. It did not disclose the source.According to WHO, Kenvue said it tested the raw ingredients used in the syrup before manufacture, and ""no issues of concern were noted"".The agency said the possibility that the syrup was counterfeit was also ""under consideration as part of investigations"".","Nigeria's regulator recalled a batch of Benylin syrup last Wednesday.

News Group Newspapers ( NGN ), its publisher, has denied accusations of illegal activity and had asked the High Court in London to delay a potential trial, provisionally due to start next January.It wanted a narrower-in-scope preliminary trial held to decide whether the cases have been brought too late and outside a legal time limit.But in a ruling Friday, judge Timothy Fancourt dismissed the request.He said there was a ""plainly considerable risk"" of a preliminary trial ""increasing costs overall and delaying"" a full trial by up to two years.""That is unsatisfactory,"" the judge added.It comes two days after actor Hugh Grant settled his claim against NGN over allegations of unlawful information gathering, saying he wanted to avoid a potential legal bill of millions of pounds.While no details of the settlement were given, Grant said on social media he had been offered an ""enormous sum of money"" not to go to court.NGN said the claim had been settled ""without admission of liability"" and that it was ""in both parties' financial interests not to progress to a costly trial"".Harry, the younger son of King Charles III, this year settled a long-running lawsuit against Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN) after alleging its journalists were linked to deceptive and unlawful methods, including phone hacking.The prince is also bringing legal action against Associated Newspapers, publisher of the Daily Mail and the Mail on Sunday.","Prince Harry's lawsuit against Rupert Murdoch's British tabloid publisher can proceed to a potential trial next year.

UK PM Rishi Sunak to Consult on Tougher Rules to Combat 'Sick Note Culture',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-pm-rishi-sunak-to-consult-on-tougher-rules-to-combat-sick-note-culture/articleshow/109420311.cms,"NEW DELHI: British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is considering tightening the rules around long-term sick leave to address the growing number of Britons permanently leaving the workforce .The participation of working-age Britons in the labor force has hit its lowest level since 2015, primarily due to an increase in long-term illness and a higher number of students compared to other large, wealthy nations which have seen rising participation since 2020.""We need to be more ambitious about helping people back to work and more honest about the risk of over-medicalising the everyday challenges and worries of life,"" said Sunak in a speech in London, seeking to appeal to core Conservative voters and arguing that a 'sicknote culture' around mental health needed to be reined in.Official data reveals that 9.4 million Britons aged 16 to 64, representing 22% of this age group, are neither employed nor actively seeking employment, a notable increase from pre-pandemic levels. Among them, 2.8 million are on long-term sick leave, while 206,000 are temporarily unwell.A report from last year highlighted that a significant portion of individuals on long-term sick leave were awaiting medical treatment, with the prospect of reducing waiting times to pre-2015 levels potentially reintegrating 25,000 individuals into the workforce. Over 50% of long-term sick individuals cited issues like depression, anxiety, or nervousness, often alongside their primary health condition.Sunak's office pointed out a tendency among healthcare professionals to issue prolonged sick notes instead of actively supporting individuals in returning to work, leading many to transition to long-term sickness benefits. ""We don't just need to change the sick note, we need to change the sick note culture , so the default becomes what work you can do – not what you can't,"" he said.Sunak proposed a potential shift in the assessment responsibility from general practitioners to healthcare workers tasked with providing objective evaluations of an individual's work capacity and the customized support needed for their reintegration.",British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is considering tightening the rules around long-term sick leave.

NEW DELHI: On June 29 last year, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle removed the last of their belongings from Frogmore Cottage , signaling the end of their residence in the UK . This day, as new business documents revealed, also marks the date Prince Harry formally declared his residency in the United States.The transition comes in the wake of an order by King Charles, which left Harry ""deeply wounded,"" as he and Meghan were asked to vacate Frogmore Cottage—a property gifted by the late Queen Elizabeth.Royal experts suggest that Harry's choice of this significant date to mark his formal move to the US was deliberate, reflecting his acknowledgment of a new life away from royal duties.Frogmore Cottage had served as the couple’s UK base even after their move to California in 2020. The change was officially recorded in filings at Companies House for Harry's eco travel venture, Travalyst, where his ‘New Country/State Usually Resident’ is now listed as the USA, a Daily Mail report said.This relocation raises substantial questions about Prince Harry’s ability to serve as a Counsellor of State—an office requiring a UK domicile. Dr Craig Prescott, a constitutional law expert, describes the scenario as ""uncharted waters,"" given the legal framework was not designed to address a senior royal family member choosing to live abroad.The implications extend beyond his royal duties, as Harry has also indicated considering US citizenship, which could necessitate renouncing his royal titles. ""The thought has crossed my mind but not a high priority right now,"" Harry stated in a February interview on Good Morning America.The disclosure of Harry's residency status has also sparked calls for the Biden administration to release his visa records, fueled by a statement from the American ambassador to London ensuring that Harry would not face deportation under the current administration.The recent developments highlight ongoing family tensions and the changing dynamics within the British royal family, as they navigate the practical and legal complexities of Prince Harry’s new life in the United States.","On June 29 last year, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle removed the last of their belongings from Frogmore Cottage.

UK PM Rishi Sunak faces leadership test as Tories trail Labour in new poll,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-pm-rishi-sunak-faces-leadership-test-as-tories-trail-labour-in-new-poll/articleshow/109398085.cms,"Key findings from the poll include:

NEW DELHI: A comprehensive poll conducted by former Tory treasurer Lord Ashcroft has revealed that the Conservative Party is trailing behind Labour on every significant political issue as articulated by the voters. This includes traditional Conservative strongholds such as defence, tax, and immigration, with an astonishing 35-point deficit on matters related to the NHS.As per a Daily Mail report, despite the overwhelming support for Labour across these issues, 45% of the electorate expressed reservations about a government led by Labour's Sir Keir Starmer. This sentiment places considerable pressure on current Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to avert a potential electoral defeat.The poll, which surveyed over 5,400 voters, indicates that Labour holds a commanding 21-point lead over the Conservatives, with potential results translating into a historic landslide victory for Labour if the trend holds in the upcoming general .On the NHS and social care, 49% of respondents favored Labour, compared to only 14% for the Conservatives.Labour also leads on the cost of living with a 41:19 margin, and on the economy and jobs with a 37:23 margin.Even on immigration, traditionally a Conservative stronghold, Labour leads by 34:20.Addressing the issue of leadership, only 13% of respondents felt that the Conservative Party's values align closely with those of the public, and a mere 11% believe theTories will win the upcoming election. Meanwhile, 34% of respondents see Sir Keir Starmer as the preferable Prime Minister over Sunak, who garnered only 19% support.The poll also touched on controversial policies such as the plan to deport Channel migrants to Rwanda, which is seen as critical to galvanizing Conservative support. Yet, public opinion is divided: 38% support the scheme, whereas 42% echo Sir Keir’s opposition, the Daily Mail report said.Lord Ashcroft highlighted the dilemma faced by Sunak, whether to delay the election in hopes of a political turnaround or to proceed as planned. He noted, ""We can surely understand why a beleaguered PM would want to put off calling an election for as long as possible in the hope that something might turn up. But what if things just keep getting worse?""As the political landscape shifts, the Conservatives face the challenge of not only retaining their base but also winning back those who have shifted their allegiance to other parties, a task made daunting by the widespread preference for Labour across almost all policy fronts.","A comprehensive poll conducted by former Tory treasurer Lord Ashcroft has revealed that the Conservative Party is trailing behind Labour on every significant political issue.
