Who is required to pay the penalty?

Income Exceeds Basic Exemption Limit: Taxpayers whose income exceeds the basic exemption limit will be penalised for late filing. The limit varies by tax regime: Rs 3 lakh under the new tax regime, irrespective of age, and different limits under the old tax regime based on age.

Section 139(1) Conditions: Even if income is below the exemption limit, taxpayers must file an ITR if they meet specific conditions in Section 139(1). These include:

Spending Rs 2 lakh or more on foreign travel. Paying Rs 1 lakh or more in electricity bills. Depositing Rs 1 crore or more in current accounts.

Holding Foreign Assets: Residents with foreign assets or income must file an ITR, even if their income is below the exemption limit. Late filing fees apply in these cases.

Exceptions to Penalties

How is a belated ITR filed?

Income Tax Return Filing FY 2023-24 : For individual taxpayers whose accounts do not need auditing, the last date to file income tax returns (ITRs) for FY 2023–24 (AY 2024–25) is July 31, 2024. Missing this deadline means filing a belated ITR , which comes with penalties and interest.Under Section 234F of the Income Tax Act, 1961, filing a belated ITR incurs a penalty of up to Rs 5,000.For small taxpayers with a taxable income not exceeding Rs 5 lakh, the penalty is restricted to Rs 1,000, according to an ET report. The important thing to note is that this penalty applies even if the belated ITR shows zero tax payable. Additionally, penal interest on the pending tax payable must be paid when filing a belated ITR.Certain taxpayers are required to pay penalties if they miss the ITR filing deadline and they fulfil the following conditions:Also Read | ITR refund status for FY 2023-24: How to check income tax refund status online - here’s a step-by-step guide for incometax.gov.in & NSDL websites Individuals might need to submit an income tax return to receive a refund.

The company is accused of failing to pay Integrated GST on services imported from its overseas branches.Based on an incident report by DGGI's Bangalore zonal unit, Infosys was required to pay GST under the reverse charge mechanism (RCM), which mandates the service recipient to pay the tax. Integrated GST applies to imports and inter-state transactions of goods and services.Infosys has disputed the allegations, stating, ""The company believes that as per regulations, GST is not applicable on these expenses. Additionally, as per a recent circular issued by the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs on the recommendations of the GST Council, services provided by the overseas branches to Indian entity are not subject to GST. It is also important to note that the GST payments are eligible for credit or refund against export of IT services.

Mosquitoes bite into health insurance claims,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/mosquitoes-bite-into-health-insurance-claims/articleshow/112415785.cms,"MUMBAI: Nearly a third of the health insurance claims recorded by insurers are due to seasonal infectious diseases . These include vector-borne diseases such as dengue and malaria , which give rise to high claims in July and August, or water-borne infections such as gastroenteritis . In winter, it is usually bronchitis or influenza.As many of these claims are related to hygiene conditions in the locality they are avoidable to a large extent.However, they impact all segments of society as evident from claims data.According to a study of reported health insurance claims by Policybazaar, vector borne diseases like Dengue and Malaria account for 15% of total seasonal illnesses claims. The cost for treating these mosquito-borne diseases typically ranges from Rs 50,000 to Rs 1,50,000. These claims surge in July and August when humid conditions create ideal breeding grounds for mosquitoes .Another illness that peaks during the monsoon is gastroenteritis or stomach flu which has the same treatment expenses as Malaria. This ailment accounts for 18% of seasonal claims. Another 10% of seasonal illness claims are due to allergic reactions where the periodicity varies according to region. Winter sees claims due to influenza and bronchitis peaking to 20% and 12% of seasonal illnesses. However, the cost of treatment is lower ranging from Rs 25,000 to Rs 1 lakh.“If you look at developed countries, the share of seasonal illnesses is much lower compared to developing countries. In case of India, even in developed parts of the country like Gurgaon there are problems of water accumulation and mosquito breeding which leads to an increase in these claims,” said Siddharth Singhal, head of health insurance, Policybazaar.“These seasonal illnesses add to the frequency of claims. However, the average claim amount is much lower than chronic illnesses, and in terms of value, the share of claims would be below 20%,” said Singhal. According to Singhal, the cases of hospitalisation for illnesses that would have earlier been treated at home have gone up. “This is a positive development as it is always good to have professional support. ,” he said.","Nearly a third of the health insurance claims recorded by insurers are due to seasonal infectious diseases.

The Rs 6,146-crore IPO for Ola Electric was the biggest in India in the last two years.The strong closing that translated to a market capitalisation of a little over Rs 40,200 crore (nearly $4.8 billion) for the top Indian electric two-wheeler company left market players surprised.During the bidding process that was open from Aug 2 to 6, the stocks were offered at Rs 72-76 per share.According to dealers and market analysts, the non-institutional part in Ola Electric’s IPO (the portion reversed for high networth investors ) didn’t see high subscription as was expected during the bidding period. Compared to smaller IPOs that get subscriptions from HNIs in double-digits, the Ola Electric issue was subscribed 2.4 times. For HNIs who look for listing gains, this low subscription figure increased the cost of application in the offer.As the stock was listed on Friday morning, lots of HNIs rushed in to sell which initially depressed the price.

Large fires are defined as those that consume more than 100 acres (40 hectares) of timber or more than 300 acres (120 hectares) of grass or brush.Thirty-two homes in the state have been lost to the fires, she said, which have been fueled by high temperatures, dry weather and low humidity.They have prompted evacuation notices across the state and largely torched rural and mountain areas, although some have also sparked closer to the Portland metro area.Level 3 ""go now"" evacuation notices were in place Friday for the small town of Cherry Grove, about 35 miles (56 kilometers) west of Portland, as a fire burned in nearby forest. David Huey, a deputy with the Washington County Sheriff's Office, said most residents evacuated after officers went door to door encouraging them to leave.Airplanes and helicopters were scooping water from nearby Henry Hagg Lake to drop on the fire, said Gert Zoutendijk, spokesperson for the Gaston Rural Fire District. The lake was set to be closed to the public throughout the weekend.The fire was roughly 0.5 square miles (1.3 square kilometers) with zero containment as of Friday afternoon, although crews have made progress on lining the fire, Zoutendijk said.Another fire near the Portland suburb of Oregon City led authorities to temporarily close part of a state highway in the morning and issue ""go now"" evacuation orders along part of the route. By mid-afternoon, authorities downgraded the evacuation and reopened the highway.The largest blaze is the Durkee Fire in eastern Oregon, which has scorched more than 459 square miles (1,200 square kilometers) but was at least 95% contained as of Friday, according to authorities. At one point it was the biggest fire in the country.California's Park Fire has since become the largest, burning more than 660 square miles (1,710 square kilometers) and destroying more than 600 structures. A man was arrested and accused of starting the fire by pushing a burning car into a gully in a wilderness park outside the Sacramento Valley city of Chico.Also in California, the Crozier Fire in El Dorado County has burned about 3 square miles (7.7 square kilometers) and was 5% contained as of Friday evening, according to Cal Fire. The fire is burning in steep and rugged terrain and threatens 4,017 structures. The weather is expected to remain hot and dry through the weekend.Some of the fires in Oregon's previous record-worst year, 2020, were among the worst natural disasters in the state's history. Blazes over Labor Day weekend killed nine people, burned more than 1,875 square miles (4,860 square kilometers) and destroyed thousands of homes and other structures.","Blazes have scorched more than 1.4 million acres, or nearly 2,200 square miles.

The US short seller 's report was released just two days before Adani Enterprises issued a $2.5 billion follow-up public offering.Mahesh Jethmalani, a senior Indian lawyer and BJP leader, alleged in July 2023 that Mark Kingdon, a US-based businessman with Chinese links, had commissioned the Hindenburg Research report.Jethmalani claimed that Kingdon, along with his wife Anla Cheng, hired Hindenburg Research to prepare the report on the Adani Group. He further alleged that they used Kotak Mahindra Investments Limited (KMIL) to set up a trading account for short-selling Adani shares, making millions in profits at the expense of Indian retail investors.Jethmalani also called on the government to investigate the links between political voices targeting the Adani group after the Hindenburg report and China, suggesting that the hit job on the Adani group was Chinese retaliation for losing out on infrastructure projects like the Haifa Port.The Supreme Court has given a clean chit to the Adani group regarding the Hindenburg charges, based on a report by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). The apex court also recently dismissed a review petition to constitute a court-monitored Special Investigation Team (SIT) probe into the Adani-Hindenburg issue.In June 2023, during the Annual General Meeting (AGM) of Adani Enterprises, Group Chairman Gautam Adani addressed the allegations, stating that they were ""faced with baseless accusations made by a foreign short seller, that questioned our decades of hard work.""","The cryptic message, posted on the company's X social media account, simply stated, ""Something big soon India"" In January 2023, Hindenburg published a report alleging financial irregularities within the Adani Group.

Bill introduced to allow up to 4 nominees in bank a/c,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/bill-introduced-to-allow-up-to-4-nominees-in-bank-a/c/articleshow/112415825.cms,"NEW DELHI: Govt on Friday introduced a bill to amend banking laws , which includes changes to nomination facility to make it more consumer-friendly, but left the floor on its holding unchanged to ensure that the Centre retains majority stake in public sector banks , indicating that stake sale in state-run banks will not be pushed.Govt had announced its intent to privatise two PSBs, along with IDBI Bank, but indications are that only stake sale in the financial institution-turned-retail lender will go through.TOI had reported on key provisions on Aug 3 after the cabinet had cleared the proposals. The bill seeks to provide for up to four nominees by a bank account holder and also extends the facility to bank lockers.Introduced by minister of state for finance Pankaj Chaudhary in the Lok Sabha, the Banking Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2024, has a provision for simultaneous and successive nominations. This means the nomination of the first nominee will be effective upon the death of the deposit or accountholder. The nomination of the second nominee will become effective only on the death of the first, it proposed.“Where the order of nomination is not mentioned, persons shall be deemed to have been nominated in the order in which their names appear in the nomination,” the bill said. The change in the nomination mechanism is seen to be crucial to ensure that deposits do not go waste as banks are known to make it cumbersome to transfer funds to heirs, resulting in nearly Rs 78,000 crore lying unclaimed with private and state-run players.The bill also seeks to transfer unclaimed dividends, shares and interest or redemption of bonds to the Investor Education and Protection Fund, allowing individuals to claim transfers or refunds from the fund, thus safeguarding investors’ interests. Another proposed change involves redefining ‘substantial interest’ for directorships, which could increase to Rs 2 crore, instead of the current limit of Rs 5 lakh, which was fixed almost six decades ago.Congress member Manish Tewari opposed introduction of the bill saying the power to legislate with regard to co-operatives vested with state govts. RSP member N K Premachandran opposed amending five legislations through one bill, while TMC member Saugata Roy termed the bill “superfluous” and said the amendments proposed in the bill could have been done through administrative decisions. Responding to opposition’s remarks, FM Nirmala Sitharaman said the various amendments done in the Banking Regulation Act with respect to cooperative banks were not just one or two but several.","Govt had announced its intent to privatise two PSBs, along with IDBI Bank, but indications are that only stake sale in the financial institution-turned-retail lender will go through. The bill seeks to provide for up to four nominees by a bank account holder and also extends the facility to bank lockers.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112415874,imgsize-67216,width-400,resizemode-4/112415874.jpg"

Railway Budget 2024 : The government has wavered little in its efforts to spur a modernisation of railways in the country, pivoting on technology, to support the country’s economic ambitions. In line with expectations, Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore, marking yet another year of successive increase in outlay.That takes forward the past policies and the government’s vision, which have paved the way for modernisation of the transport behemoth.In earlier decades, the government had focused on laying tracks on new routes, electrification and incremental rolling stock capacity addition. That was the need of the hour back then and has helped set up the base for a larger transformation.For instance, the massive Dedicated Freight Corridor ( DFC ) as well as locomotive factories at Marhaura and Madhepura in Bihar were conceptualised over a decade ago and we are seeing their completion now.More recently, the focus has shifted to modernisation—of rolling stock and safety systems, among other aspects.This year, emphasis has also been laid on the railways’ crucial role in industrial development. Commodity-specific corridors have been planned in eastern India and impetus given to port connectivity. Vande Bharat and technology-led upgrades in rolling stock remain in focus. Safety has been prioritised through budgetary allocations for the anti-collision systemKavach . That said, there are other cogs in the wheel that demand attention from a long-term perspective.First, the target for the Operating Ratio, the crucial efficiency gauge, has been set at 98.22% for 2024-25, compared with 98.65% in 2023-24. This reflects an imminent need for operational transformation. An effective overhaul of the world’s fourth-largest rail network will take many years and thus we need to start focusing on improving efficiency and reducing costs now.DFC is almost entirely operational and will be complete over the next few months. To ensure the project achieves its twin goals of reducing logistics costs and enhancing freight efficiency, railways need to attract more cargo on the corridor. This will help increase the rail coefficient and make the railways’ approach more market-oriented, which will in turn aid future corridors.A revamp of railway stations is on track, with sufficient funds dedicated to this end. But even though new coaches and wagons are increasingly being added to meet footfalls, the stations and passenger trains themselves remain synonymous with chaos.Just as safety, comfort and convenience have been prioritised, there is a need for solutions to address the capacity and demand challenges. As a first step, the government could target development of new stations and setting up of new coach production units.As a leading freight mover, Indian Railways carried a record 1,588 MT cargo in fiscal 2024, up from 1,095 MT in fiscal 2015. It accounts for 26% of the cargo moved in the country—by no means an easy feat. The railways aims to take this volume to 3,000 MT by 2030, which would require a 11% CAGR against the around 4.2% witnessed over the last 10 years. As per a report by TERI and Shakti Foundation, from carrying about 62% of freight traffic in 1990-91, Indian Railways’ share has declined to ~27% in 2014-15. This has been due to the expanding road network, cost competitiveness over railways, and door-to-door service. Thus, commencing the cycle of increasing the rail share again is commendable.DFCs, a high-capacity track network, high-power locomotives and improvement in wagon designs have set the ball rolling for larger capacity, faster freight trains that deliver better efficiency.Yet, achieving exponential growth is a tall ask given the current dynamics. Possibly, similar challenges might apply to other goals the railways might have for 2047.To be fair, despite its scale and complexity, Indian Railways has been able to achieve diverse developments at commendable speed.But the track ahead is long and it is time to start discussing the reinvention of the institutional set-up.Indian Railways sees substantial private sector involvement in the form of vendors and contractors. Policymakers could start mulling extreme options such as parallel privately-owned and operated railway infrastructure, coupled with centralised planning and an evolved role for the railways. This will need a robust policy framework from the Government of India.The time is perhaps also ripe to bring user charge and asset monetisation-driven segments for passengers as well as cargo to the discussion table. Globally, the separation of infrastructure and operations in railways has delivered mixed results, for example in the United Kingdom. The model should be analysed and revisited to understand its potential relevance in the Indian context.The key would be to retrace our steps and align our long-term goals to identify not just incremental changes but also ways to explore bold and path-breaking alternatives that put Indian Railways on a smooth track and bring it up to speed.","Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore.

Budget 2024 capital gains tax changes: The Narendra Modi government is considering suggestions for tweaks in the new long term capital gains tax regime that was announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman in Union Budget 2024.The July 23 budget reduced the LTCG tax on property from 20% to 12.5%. The indexation benefit, which allowed taxpayers to adjust the acquisition cost for inflation before calculating capital gains and thus reduce their tax liability, is proposed to be eliminated for properties purchased on or after April 1, 2001.The government publishes the Cost Inflation Index (CII) annually for this calculation.India Inc is appealing to the government for a gradual shift to the long-term capital gains tax regime proposed in the FY25 budget, which aims to eliminate indexation benefits for property, gold, and other unlisted assets.According to an ET report by Deepshikha Sikarwar, the industry is suggesting alternatives such as a higher tax rate with indexation or a lower rate of 12.5% without indexation, as well as some form of grandfathering for ancestral properties.The finance ministry is currently reviewing these proposals and will discuss them with the Prime Minister's Office. The final decision will be made closer to the date when the Finance Bill reply is to be presented in Parliament, the reports said.Industry groups are expected to submit formal proposals to the finance ministry in the near future.

Budget 2024 for manufacturing sector : The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth. While the middle class has been offered tax relief, the government's primary focus remains on judicious spending to maximize economic impact. The budget's core themes are employment, skilling, MSME development, and support for the middle class.Largely focus has remained intact on spending money judiciously to ensure that each penny spent creates a ripple effect in the entire economic landscape.Although at first glance, manufacturing might appear to have taken a backseat, a deeper analysis reveals a multifaceted approach to bolstering the sector. Initiatives like employment-linked benefits and internship programs, while primarily aimed at job creation and skill development, indirectly benefit manufacturing companies by expanding the talent pool.Extensive focus on the MSME manufacturing units by way of extending term loan facility for purchase of machinery and equipment without collateral or third-party guarantee, would help companies in augmenting their capital base/ capacity and strengthen the very foundation of the manufacturing ecosystem in the country. Development of a new credit-assessment model by Public Sector Banks to assess MSME credit shall provide much needed regulatory relief to the units.With respect to the large manufacturing entities, while there is no direct fiscal/ tax incentive introduced in this budget, some support has been provided with an extensive focus on development of ‘industrial parks’ in nearly 100 cities under the ‘plug and play’ model. Reforms proposed with respect to land administration, planning and management, shall also ease out acquisition related difficulties often faced by entrepreneurs/ business houses in acquiring lands for manufacturing set-ups.Targeted Customs duty interventions like, rationalization of Customs duty provisions in Mobile phone manufacturing setups, extension of Customs duty exemption on import of capital goods for manufacturing of solar cells and panels, full Customs duty exemption on import of 25 critical minerals,, shall provide the required impetus for enhancing domestic manufacturing environment.Governments’ focus on formulating an Economic Policy Framework to set the scope for next-gen reforms in the country, has a target to improve the productivity of factors of production, namely, land, labour, capital, entrepreneurship and technology. This shall pave the way for enabling achievement of a target of 25% manufacturing sector contribution to the nation’s GDP over the course of next 7-10 years.While the overall outlook is positive, the extension of tax benefits under Section 115BAB for manufacturing entities and the absence of new PLI schemes are notable omissions.The country’s manufacturing base is expanding as is reflective from the continuously increasing tax collections and expanding Purchasing Manager’s Index. It would be pertinent to see how the ground realities evolve vis-à-vis the vision envisaged, in the upcoming Financial Year.","The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth.

Budget 2024: Armed with the vision to propel India to become a developed country by 2047, the Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business thereby providing the required stimulus to the manufacturing sector and enabling large scale job creation.On the Indirect tax front, the industry welcomes the much-needed announcement for a comprehensive review of the rate structure under Customs enabling ease in product classification and dispute reduction. The proposal of lowering of Customs duty on a plethora of raw materials and products including solar cells, critical minerals and bullion are encouraging measures. The rationale behind such reduction clearly indicates support towards domestic manufacturing, deepening value addition and supporting targets in reducing carbon footprint.Relevant amendments under the Customs law have been made to provide increased time limits for re-imports and re-exports to enhance competitiveness of the fledgling MRO sector. The government has extended significant duty reduction and exemption benefits to the healthcare and electronics sectors, continuing the impetus of incentives provided under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme.Since their introduction in March 2020, the PLI schemes have indeed supported in revitalizing the manufacturing sector and strengthening the necessary supply chains. The success achieved in the mobile manufacturing sector has now enabled the Government to reduce customs duties on mobile phones and components, signalling a mature environment. The Budget proposals aim at reproducing similar outcomes for semiconductor and pharmaceutical industry by increasing the budgetary allocation.Buoyed by the increasing revenue collection under GST signalling a shift towards a mature tax regime, this Budget has harmonized the timeframes for the issuance of demand notices and adjudication orders for cases involving fraud, suppression or otherwise. Significant amendments to the GST legislations have been introduced reflecting the recommendations proposed by the GST Council such as regularizing non-levy of GST due to general practice which may turn out to be a breather for certain impacted industries reeling under huge tax demands.The Insurance sector has been provided much relief through the GST council recommendations which have been cemented in the present budget thereby ending long standing disputes on their business practices.The Government's efforts to push forward with its reform agenda are evident as plans to incentivize states for their business reform actions plans and digitalization through the Jan Vishwas Bill 2.0 is proposed. Further, setting up of e-commerce export hubs is envisaged to facilitate easier access to international markets for domestic players.The recent implementation of Budget proposals allows the government to maintain momentum in its reform agenda. These policy measures implicitly reaffirm the significance of India Inc as a crucial element in the development of infrastructure. However, there are still some expectations required to be met to march towards a Viksit Bharat 2047.",The Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business.

Budget 2024 : Real estate, a significant contributor to employment generation, has received a fair bit of attention in Budget 2024-25. Recent years have seen the sector transform rapidly, driven by factors such as favourable government policies, Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, strong economic growth and changing consumer preferences.Added to that, the budgetary focus on job creation, skilling and employment-linked incentives, infrastructure, urban development, rural connectivity, digitalisation and land-related norms, all dovetail to promote growth of the sector.Launched in June 2015, the PMAY aims to provide affordable housing to all eligible beneficiaries. The budget unveiled PMAY Urban 2.0, under which the housing needs of 1 crore urban poor and middle class will be addressed with an investment of Rs 10 lakh crore.The central government’s additional Rs 2.2 lakh crore injection in the next 5 years to make housing more affordable has the potential to revitalise the affordable housing market.Such an approach can play an important role in realising the government's vision of Housing for All and push growth and development. Hence, the significant investment under PMAY Urban 2.0 is expected to alleviate urban housing deficits, spurring construction and economic growth.Steps to introduce technological reforms within the regulatory framework for land, such as digitalisation or GIS mapping of land records, will improve transparency.Rationalisation of stamp duty across states will also be critical to bring in uniformity and initiate land-related reforms such as urban planning, usage and building bylaws.These are steps in the right direction and will boost growth. Moreover, they will improve the ease of property transactions and strengthen municipal finances through increased property taxes. Rationalization of stamp duty with an emphasis on women homebuyers may boost home-buyer sentiment in major cities, too.The budget has also given ample attention to urban and rural development, with rental housing for industrial workers through the public private partnership model, interest subsidies for rental housing, and transit-oriented developments.The proposal to develop investment-ready plug-and-play industrial parks in 100 cities may attract industrial investment, leading to increased demand for industrial real estate and support the growth of ancillary services and residential developments in these regions.Initiatives for industrial parks and rental housing for industrial workers align with the country’s manufacturing goals and addresses worker accommodation needs.These steps are expected to promote industrial growth and stability in labour-intensive sectors, while also creating new opportunities for real estate developers specialising in rental and affordable housing.The changes in long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax, however, have evoked a mixed reaction. The government lowered the long-term capital gains tax from 20% to 12.5%, which is a welcome step. However, this came with the removal of the indexation benefit.The changes could encourage more liquidity in property transactions and potentially increase the effective tax burden depending on the property’s acquisition date.The launch of Phase IV of the PM Gram Sadak Yojana in 25,000 rural habitations will improve connectivity in rural areas, promoting rural development and making these regions more accessible for investment. The primary objective of PMGSY is to build robust, all-weather roads in rural habitations. This initiative focuses on enhancing connectivity and supporting economic development in rural areas.In essence, the budget is geared towards stimulating growth and investment in the real estate sector , fostering a more transparent and investor-friendly environment, and contributing to overall development. It aims to create a balanced and inclusive growth environment by addressing the needs of various segments, including affordable housing, industrial workers and urban infrastructure.The effectiveness of the initiatives, however, hinges on their implementation and continued support of complementary reforms.","Budget 2024-25 is geared towards stimulating growth and investment in the real estate sector.

New Budget 2024 rule: Why Income Tax Department is likely to issue a huge number of tax notices this month,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-budget-2024-rule-why-income-tax-department-is-likely-to-issue-a-huge-number-of-tax-notices-this-month/articleshow/112186079.cms,"Taxing Times

Income Tax Notice on the way? The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month, as there are concerns that many taxpayers might escape the tax net due to the impending implementation of the new reassessment law on September 1, 2024.According to the amended regulation announced in Budget 2024 , the tax authorities can only go back a maximum of five years to reassess a taxpayer's records if the escaped income is at least Rs 50 lakh, and three years for an amount less than Rs 50 lakh.Previously, they could reassess cases up to 10 years old.According to an ET report, tax officials are now faced with the challenge of compiling and corroborating data on tax and income mismatches for the financial years 2013-14 to 2017-18 within the next few weeks, as these years will become time-barred for reassessment from September 1, 2024.The I-T department relies on information from various sources, such as banks, property registrars, and search findings from the investigation wing, to build reassessment cases.A tax officers' body has raised concerns about the feasibility of issuing notices under Section 148 (or 148A) in a large number of cases within a single month, given the overburdened nature of the jurisdictional assessing officers and the time-consuming process of obtaining sanction from the chief commissioner, who is the specified authority for such notices.Moreover, the law provides taxpayers with the right to explain their position before reassessment orders are finalized, a process that most believe cannot be completed by the end of August.Also Read | ITR refund status for FY 2023-24: How to check income tax refund status online - here’s a step-by-step guide for incometax.gov.in & NSDL websites The Central Board of Direct Taxes ( CBDT ) has been urged by its officers to postpone the effective date of the proposed amendment. However, this suggestion is unlikely to be well-received by corporations and high net worth individuals.""Capping the reassessment period at five years was a great decision as it would reduce hassles and litigation. But if the department fears there could be a genuine loss of revenue as it may not be possible to wrap up several matters by August 31, the government can think of strict parameters where time-bound cases can be selectively reopened - based on trails of steps taken in identifying escaped income,"" said Mitil Chokshi, partner at CA firm Chokshi & Chokshi.""Taxpayers may expect a rush of reassessment notices in August 2024. These notices are likely to be for the AYs 2018-19 and prior to that. It is pertinent to note that the Bombay High Court in a recent ruling in a case of Hexaware Technologies has taken a view on a proviso introduced in 2021, which can be interpreted to mean that AY 2017-18 (and prior years) got time barred on March 31, 2024. These reassessment notices (for AYs 2017-18 and prior) are likely to rake up new interpretation issues in the already muddled reassessment provisions,"" said Ashish Mehta, partner at law firm Khaitan & Co.The current situation is similar to the conflict between the Income Tax office and taxpayers in 2021. The reassessment law was amended in April 2021, allowing the tax office to reopen 10-year-old tax returns if the total undisclosed income exceeded Rs 50 lakh and reassess 4-year-old matters if the amount was less than Rs 50 lakh.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? However, this change led to over 10,000 writ petitions being filed by companies, arguing that they were not given sufficient time to explain and that the notices were issued without considering the carve-out that cases which couldn't be reopened earlier couldn't be reassessed under the new law.The Supreme Court invoked its extraordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution on May 4, 2022, to uphold all reassessment notices issued after March 31, 2021. However, the court left room for judicial proceedings based on the merits of each case, and several such matters are currently pending before the court.","The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month.

What is NPS Vatsalaya?

Latest NPS rules, news: In the Union Budget 2024 speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced two new initiatives with regard to National Pension Scheme (NPS) - extension of NPS 14% employer contribution benefits to private setcor and the intended launch of NPS Vatsalya.Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries, bringing it at par with the provisions available for government employees.Sriram Iyer, CEO, HDFC Pension Management told ET that with this move the “ground rules have been harmonised among government and non-government employees, which is a positive step.”Effectively, this means that now, private-sector employees can choose to reduce the taxable portion of employers’ contribution to their NPS corpus, thereby paying less tax and leaving greater funds in their pension deposits.“Employees will benefit from tax savings . More importantly, the 40% increase in contribution will have a significant impact on the terminal value of the retirement corpus,” remarked Iyer. The extended savings will “help in retirement planning, working as an option that is at par with the Provident Fund,” Dinesh Rohira, CEO & Founder, 5nance.com was quoted as saying.Moreover, the endeavour aims to increase NPS penetration by increasing tax incentives for the private sector, providing them a social security-cushion post-retirement.The scheme’s motive to widen the NPS subscriber base may not prove to be flawlessly effective, however. This is explained by Agrees Mrin Agarwal, Founder, Finsafe India: “While it’s good that the limit has been raised, it may not increase adoption as employees need to be educated in a big way. Also, the benefit is only for the salaried opting for the new tax regime,” she says.The mandatory contribution to the EPF, too, threatens to relegate the provisions of NPS under the umbrella of near-superfluity. This sentiment is echoed by Varun Sahay, a software engineer in a Delhi-based IT company: “When 12% of my salary is already deducted for the EPF, why should I put in more in the NPS and cut my take-home pay?”Rohira feels otherwise. “There’s no competition between the NPS and EPF as employees can contribute to both and build a 3-4 times bigger corpus while earning 3-4% higher returns via marketlinked options in the NPS,” he counters.Also Check | New Tax Regime 2023 vs 2024 After Budget: How Much Income Tax Will Salaried Taxpayers Save & How Do New Tax Slabs Compare To Old Regime? Top 10 Points You Must Know To jumpstart retirement savings for children, a new initiative called NPS Vatsalya has been unveiled in the Budget. This scheme allows parents and guardians to contribute to a minor's account, which can be converted into a regular NPS account once the child reaches adulthood.""It provides a very long duration for reaping the compounding benefits and accumulating a huge bounty at a later age. This can be a good way to plan a better future for kids who may not opt for a service segment in the future,"" says Rohira. Sriram Iyer agrees, stating, ""It’s a good move to help the child start his retirement journey. Even if a parent starts when the child is 10 years old, by the time he starts working, it can be a solid foundation for the compounding journey after that.""However, some experts question the utility of a product with such a long lock-in period, especially when parents cannot use the funds for essential goals like their child’s education amidst soaring education costs of 11-12%.""Parents are struggling to save for their own retirement, so it might be a bit of a stretch to expect them to save for their kids’ retirement. The need of the hour is a market-linked product that allows withdrawals only for the child’s education,"" says Mrin Agarwal, Founder of Finsafe India.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? Though the NPS permits partial withdrawals, it allows only 25% of the corpus after three years of joining, and this can be done only three times during the entire tenure. A premature exit before 60 years with 100% withdrawal is only possible if the corpus is less than Rs.2.5 lakh, an amount insufficient for most children's goals.""In its current form, there won’t be any uptake,"" asserts Agarwal. Rohira concurs, ""It’s a vanilla product with a lock-in, which does not make it very attractive and it may not take off. However, the government may optimise it and introduce new features later."" Iyer adds, ""This is just a start and there may be more subscriber-friendly features as we take it to the market. The regulator is proactive and open to feedback.""","Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries.

Gold import duty cut: Why Indians may not find buying gold from Dubai as attractive post Budget 2024,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-import-duty-cut-why-indians-may-not-find-buying-gold-from-dubai-as-attractive-post-budget-2024/articleshow/112097671.cms,"Gold import duty cut in Budget 2024: The recent reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai. Indian jewellers with stores in both India and the UAE believe that the narrowed duty differential will result in lower gold prices in India, making it less attractive for Indians to purchase gold in Dubai.The emirate had attracted gold-enthusiast Indians following a steep rise in customs duty in India in July 2022. In the fiscal 2024-25 budget, the duty on gold imports was more than halved.The duty cut is also expected to boost gold jewellery production in India, particularly the popular 'Kolkatti' jewellery from Kolkata, which is favored by Indian expats in Dubai and tourists from various countries. This move will encourage gold artisans to create new designs in both heavyweight and lightweight jewellery, attracting consumers to purchase gold from India.According to an ET report, Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group , estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India as Indian tourists who previously bought jewellery in Dubai will now prefer to shop in India. However, Indian expats living in Dubai and other customers may continue to buy from the UAE.Also Read | Gold losing sheen?

He points out that the labour cost is significantly lower in India, and with the introduction of mandatory hallmarking and HUID numbers, the purity of gold in India is no longer a concern.Furthermore, NRIs in Dubai do not receive VAT refunds, and Indians travelling abroad only receive about 60% of the VAT back on their gold purchases. Gold trade analyst Bhargav Baidya suggests that the 1% duty differential between gold jewellery in India and Dubai will be offset by Indian jewellers offering discounts to retain and attract customers.Saurabh Gadgil, chairman of PNG Jewellers, notes that Indian import duty is now on par with the US, allowing Indian jewellers to offer competitive prices compared to other countries worldwide. The reduced customs duty is expected to make gold purchases in India more attractive and convenient for Indian consumers, potentially leading to a significant shift in their gold shopping preferences.",The reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai.

Gold losing sheen? The government has reduced its target for issuing gold bonds in the financial year 2024-25 by 38% compared to the previous interim budget goal, according to a senior official. The revised target stands at Rs 18,500 crore, down from Rs 29,638 crore estimated in the interim budget and Rs 26,852 crore (revised estimate) in 2023-24.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told ET ""The decision followed a reassessment of various factors, including investor demand, other investment products and uncertainties around the global economy, as the situation has changed since the interim budget in February.""After accounting for redemptions, the net issuances of sovereign gold bonds are now estimated at Rs 15,000 crore for this fiscal year, a significant decrease from the Rs 26,138 crore projected in the interim budget and Rs 25,352 crore in the revised estimate for 2023-24.Harish Galipelli, director at ILA Commodities India, attributed this shift to retail investors increasingly opting for equities in anticipation of better returns. He also noted that people are uncertain about the potential for further increases in gold prices in the short-to-medium term following a recent rally. Additionally, Galipelli pointed out that savings in rural areas have been impacted by retail inflation and other factors.The gold bond and gold monetisation schemes were introduced by the government in late 2015 to discourage the physical purchase of precious metals and reduce imports, thereby mitigating the negative impact on the current account deficit.The gross collection through these two schemes is now projected to be Rs 20,030 crore in 2024-25, compared to Rs 31,168 crore in the interim budget and Rs 28,240 crore (revised estimate) in the previous fiscal year. Similarly, the net collection is estimated at Rs 16,433 crore, down from Rs 27,571 crore in the interim budget and Rs 26,653 crore in the previous year.

"Now, Hindenburg questions Sebi chief, spouse's dealings",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/now-hindenburg-questions-sebi-chief-spouses-dealings/articleshow/112434497.cms,"Not much ‘substance’ in Hindenburg report, say market veterans

MUMBAI: Hindenburg Research, the US short-seller that in Jan 2023 had alleged extensive corporate fraud by the Adani group using offshore vehicles, on Saturday night cited whistleblower documents claiming that Sebi chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch, with husband Dhaval, had also invested in the same offshore vehicles. Sebi chief and her husband, through 360 One WAM (IIFL’s wealth management arm), had allegedly invested in Global Dynamic Opportunities Fund, the same fund that Vinod Adani, elder brother of Gautam Adani , had used to invest in Adani group’s stocks, Hindenburg said.The Adani group has refuted all of Hindenburg’s allegations.The report that was released late Saturday evening alleged that Sebi’s “drew a blank” in its probe against Adani due to the alleged investments by Buch and her husband in the offshore funds. In March 2017, before Buch was appointed Sebi member, Dhaval wrote to the Mauritius fund administrator informing that he would become the sole person to operate the account. Subsequently, in Feb 2018, after joining Sebi, Buch purportedly sought to redeem all the units held with the Fund, Hindenburg said. A Sebi spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment, while a spokesperson for 360 One WAM declined comment.Hindenburg’s latest report also pointed out that between April 2017 and March 2022, when Buch was a whole-time member at Sebi and then its chief, she allegedly had a 100% interest in an offshore Singaporean consulting firm called Agora Partners . On March 16, 2022, two weeks after her appointment as Sebi chairperson, she “quietly transferred the shares to her husband”, the report alleged.“This offshore Singaporean entity is exempt from disclosing financial statements so it is unclear the amount of revenue it derives from its consulting business and from whom — crucial information for those assessing the probity of the chairperson’s external businesses interests.”But she allegedly continued to retain 99% stake in Agora Advisory Pvt Ltd, an Indian consulting firm, where her husband is a director. In 2022, it reported revenues of $261 million (around Rs 2,000 crore)“Conclusion: Conflict or capture? Either way, we do not think Sebi can be trusted as an objective arbiter in the Adani matter,” Hindenburg said, while calling for further probe.The report also mentions that while Buch was a whole-time member at Sebi, her husband was appointed a senior adviser to Blackstone in 2019. “He had not worked for a fund, in real estate or capital markets before, as per his LinkedIn profile,” it said, while alleging a conflict of interest.On its part, on June 27 this year Sebi had issued a showcause notice to Hindenburg, alleging deficient disclosures about their short positions in Adani stocks.Using whistleblower documents, Hindenburg on Saturday said that Buch and her husband Dhaval first appeared to have opened their joint account with one offshore fund on June 5, 2015, in Singapore. “A declaration of funds, signed by a principal at IIFL states that the source of the investment is ‘salary’ and the couple’s net worth is estimated at $10 million,” the report said.Hindenburg said that after it released its initial report against Adani group that within five weeks wiped off about 65% of the group’s market value it was surprised by the regulator’s actions that failed to find faults with the ports-to-FMCG group. “What we hadn’t realised: the current Sebi chairperson and her husband had hidden stakes in the exact same obscure offshore Bermuda and Mauritius funds, found in the same complex nested structure, used by Vinod Adani,” it said.“We suspect Sebi's unwillingness to take meaningful action against suspect offshore shareholders in the Adani Group may stem from (Sebi) chairperson Madhabi Buch ’s complicity in using the exact same funds used by Vinod Adani, brother of Gautam Adani.”Following the controversy that erupted post the Hindenburg report was published, Sebi started its own investigations into the allegations. At the same time, despite pressure from the opposition at Parliament, the govt declined to refer the case to a joint parliamentary committee (JPC). But a suit in the Supreme Court was filed which directed Sebi to investigate under its directions.Later in 2023, the Supreme Court had said that Sebi had “drawn a blank” in its investigations into who funded Adani’s offshore shareholders. “If Sebi really wanted to find the offshore fund holders, perhaps the Sebi chairperson could have started by looking in the mirror,” Hindenburg's latest report said. “We find it unsurprising that Sebi was reluctant to follow a trail that may have led to its own chairperson.”Market veterans, fund managers and institutional traders TOI spoke to, however, said that although optically the report was highly damaging to Sebi and its chief, there was not much ‘substance’ in it. Indians who open offshore accounts use IIFL’s vehicles which mostly invest in a segregated manner. “Those vehicles aren’t commingled,” said an offshore trader.","US short-seller Hindenburg Research claims Sebi chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch, with husband Dhaval, invested in the same offshore vehicles.

RBI has expressed concern over lending growth being faster than the rise in deposits for several months and finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Saturday said that bank executives should focus more on the “core activity”.“Huge deposits have always been a lazy banker’s job. But the trickles which come are going to be your bread and butter money to bank on lending regularly. That trickle was the emphasis a long time ago, deposit mobilisation. Now we have gone over to this side completely... Requisite small deposits is a very important job of the bank, it may be grinding, monotonous, but that’s where your bread and butter comes,” Sitharaman told reporters after addressing the customary post-budget board meeting of RBI. The minister said she will take it up, along with other issues, when she meets state-run bank chiefs later this month.RBI governor Shaktikanta Das too called for banks to innovate. “There will always be a mismatch... We have been witnessing a 300-400 basis points (or 3-4 percentage points) gap between credit and deposit growth, deposits are lower. It has been observed for the last few months. At the moment, our effort is to just highlight this point: a proactive caution for bank managements that going forward, this may create structural issues with regard to liquidity management. As it stands today, there is no crisis, but it needs to be dealt with by individual banks... Today, lending has become digital, so there is very fast growth. Deposit mobilisation is still in the physical mode. Banks will have to come out with innovative approaches to mobilise deposits,” he told reporters.He also made it clear that banks were free to decide on interest rates and RBI did not want to “distort” the market through intervention. On rate cut, he said the focus was usually on borrowers, but there were depositors too whose interest had to be kept in mind.On the decision to change the rules for nomination in the banking amendment bill introduced in Parliament on Friday, the FM said, “Nominations is one of the customer-friendly steps as it is important for customers to have a choice and to ensure nominees do not face any difficulty in getting what is rightfully theirs...

What the report says

Hindenburg: It has been nearly 18 months since our original report on the Adani Group presented overwhelming evidence that the Indian conglomerate was operating ""the largest con in corporate history"". Our report exposed a web of offshore, primarily Mauritius-based shell entities used for suspected billions of dollars of undisclosed related party transactions, undisclosed investment and stock manipulation.

Since then, despite the evidence, along with over 40 independent media investigations corroborating and expanding on our original work, Indian securities regulator SEBI has taken no public action against the Adani Group.

""In our July 2024 response to the ‘show cause’ notice [sent by Sebi], we wrote that we found it odd how SEBI—a regulator specifically set up to prevent fraudulent practices – showed little interest in meaningfully pursuing the parties that ran a secret offshore shell empire engaging in billions of dollars of undisclosed related party transactions through public companies while propping up its stocks through a network of sham investment entities.

""IPE Plus Fund"" is a small offshore Mauritius fund set up by an Adani director through India Infoline (IIFL), a wealth management firm with ties to the Wirecard Scandal

Vinod Adani – brother of Gautam Adani – used this structure to invest in Indian markets with funds allegedly siphoned from over invoicing of power equipment to the Adani Group.

The current SEBI Chairperson and her husband, Dhaval Buch, had hidden stakes in the exact same obscure offshore Bermuda and Mauritius funds, found in the same complex nested structure, used by Vinod Adani, says the Hindenburg report.

As per Hindenburg: Madhabi Buch and her husband Dhaval Buch first appear to have opened their account with IPE Plus Fund 1 on June 5, 2015 in Singapore, per whistleblower documents.

NEW DELHI: Hindenburg Research , the firm known for its critical report on the Adani Group , has now made allegations against Madhabi Puri Buch , the chief of Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi). They claim that she had stakes in ""obscure offshore entities used in Adani money siphoning scandal"".Citing whistleblower documents, Hindenburg said Buch and her husband held stakes in an offshore fund where a substantial amount of money was invested by Vinod Adani, brother of Gautam Adani, who is chairman of the Adani group of companies.Hindenburg's initial report in January 2023 accused the Adani Group of engaging in various fraudulent activities, leading to a market value erosion of over $150 billion. The report prompted Sebi to investigate the group, including its offshore investments and financial practices.Recently, SEBI issued a show-cause notice to Hindenburg, alleging that the firm colluded with a US hedge fund to profit from the report by using non-public information.Responding to Hindenburg's new claims, the SEBI chairperson issued a press statement calling the charges made by the US short-seller ""baseless"" and ""devoid of truth"".""In the context of allegations made in the Hindenburg Report dated August 10,2024 against us, we would like to state that we strongly deny the baseless allegations and insinuations made in the report. The same are devoid of any truth. Our life and finances are an open book. All disclosures as required have already been furnished to SEBI over the years,"" reads a press statement by SEBI chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch and her husband Dhaval Buch, according to news agency PTI.""We have no hesitation in disclosing any and all financial documents, including those that relate to the period when we were strictly private citizens, to any and every authority that may seek them. Further, in the interest of complete transparency, we would be issuing a detailed statement in due course. It is unfortunate that Hindenburg Research against whom SEBI has taken an Enforcement action and issued a show cause notice has chosen to attempt character assassination in response to the same,"" they further said.The Congress on Saturday used the Latin phrase ""Quis Custodiet Ipsos"" or ""who will guard the guards themselves"" to take a swipe at Sebi chief Madhabi Buch, after Hindenburg released the report.Tagging the Hindenburg post on the allegations on X, Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh said, ""Quis Custodiet Ipsos Custodes (who will guard the guards themselves).""In another post on the microblogging platform, Ramesh said, ""Parliament was notified to sit till the evening of August 12.

The discussions were expected to cover the provisions of the budget and the current economic conditions in the country.Sitharaman highlighted the need for banks to devise ""innovative and attractive"" schemes to boost deposit mobilization, describing deposits and lending as ""the two wheels of a cart,"" with deposits currently lagging. She stressed that banks should concentrate on their core business, which involves mobilizing deposits and providing loans to those in need.In a joint press conference with Sitharaman, RBI governor Shaktikanta Das addressed concerns about the deposit-lending mismatch in the banking sector. He noted that interest rates on deposits and lending are deregulated, allowing banks the freedom to set their rates. ""Banks are free to decide on interest rates,"" Das said.Earlier in the week, while unveiling the bi-monthly monetary policy, Das expressed concerns about banks increasingly relying on short-term non-retail deposits and other liabilities to meet credit demand. He warned that this could expose the banking system to structural liquidity issues. ""Banks may, therefore, focus more on the mobilization of household financial savings through innovative products and service offerings and by leveraging fully on their vast branch network,"" Das stated.Sitharaman reiterated the government's commitment to simplifying tax laws and procedures to facilitate growth and employment. She praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi's vision for a technology-driven taxation regime, aiming for transparency and equity. ""This year also, our approach has been that we bring in greater simplification of tax laws and procedures, and that we enable growth and employment in this country,"" she said.The RBI recently decided to maintain the repo rate at 6.5 percent, marking the ninth consecutive decision to keep it unchanged.

The Goods and Services Tax (GST) is a value-added tax (VAT) applied to most goods and services sold for domestic use. Although consumers ultimately bear the cost of the GST , the responsibility for collecting and remitting this tax to the government falls on the businesses that sell these goods and services.The Goods and Services Tax (GST) registration process has been streamlined and is now entirely online, accessible through the government website at gst.gov.in.Initially, GST registration may not be required if your business's aggregate revenue is below Rs 20 lakh. However, once revenue exceeds this threshold, registration becomes mandatory. CA Nitin Sharma highlights that the process is efficient and manageable online, where you receive a Temporary Reference Number (TRN) after application.The GST number assignment follows, and the approval generally takes 7-10 days if all documents are in order. In cases of issues, processing may extend to 15-20 days. Registration costs vary, with fees ranging from Rs 2,500 to Rs 5,000 for individuals and up to Rs 10,000 for private limited companies.For GST registration, you will need the following documents:GST has replaced various earlier taxes, consolidating them into a single tax system. GST registration is mandatory for businesses with an annual turnover exceeding Rs 20 lakh (or Rs 40 lakh in some cases). Operating a business without GST registration is illegal and could result in significant fines. Registration ensures compliance with tax laws and helps avoid legal complications.For new companies, trademark registration is also crucial to protect their brand. This prevents others from using similar names. The government fee for trademark registration is Rs 4,500, with a non-proprietor fee of Rs 9,000 and a filing charge of Rs 1,500.For further updates and detailed guidance, stay informed through official channels and professional advice.","The Goods and Services Tax (GST) is a value-added tax (VAT) applied to most goods and services sold for domestic use.

Pulses import likely to drop due to good monsoon and higher imports last year,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/pulses-import-likely-to-drop-due-to-good-monsoon-and-higher-imports-last-year/articleshow/112416091.cms,"NEW DELHI: The import of pulses is likely to decline marginally to 40-45 lakh tonne compared to last year’s 47 lakh tonne due to good monsoon resulting in rise in production and last year’s higher import of pulses, India Pulses and Grains Association (IPGA) said on Friday while demanding the govt have a long term and stable policy on import of the key kitchen item.Experts said that unless the current policies are changed, the overall import of pulses might double to around 80-100 lakh tonne by 2030 considering the increasing consumption.Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of a seminar on pulses titled “Bharat Dalhan-2024”, IPGA chairman Bimal Kothari said they expect the govt to frame a long-term policy for the Rs 2.5 lakh crore pulses market, as frequent changes in policies hurt the interest of all stakeholders.He added that India imported 16 lakh tonne of masoor dal last fiscal. “We need only 10 lakh tonne imports of masoor dal. Imports of yellow peas may also fall from 2023-24 level,” he said. Kothari added that prices of pulses in wholesale markets have fallen in the last month and are expected to ease further. Tur prices have come down by Rs 20 per kg in wholesale markets in the past month. “Pulses prices will not increase this year, rather they will keep falling,” he said.Agriculture economist Ashok Gulati said that self-sufficiency in pulses production cannot be achieved through ‘empty’ slogans. “We need to work towards that through concerted policy prescription. If we don’t make changes in policy and continue business as usual, our import will touch 80-100 lakh tonne by 2030,” he said.Gulati added that policies which are centred around encouraging paddy production should be reversed and farmers in states like Punjab can be offered a subsidy of Rs 39,000 per hectare for five years for taking up pulses cultivation instead of paddy.",Good monsoon resulting in rise in production and last year’s higher import of pulses.

Japan's scientists warn of a 'megaquake': What it means,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/japans-scientists-warn-of-a-megaquake-what-it-means/articleshow/112393822.cms,"What does the warning say?

What is 'megaquake'?

What's at risk?

Japan PM scraps overseas trip

Japan 's earthquake scientists have issued a warning that the country should be prepared for a potential "" megaquake "" in the future, which could result in the loss of hundreds of thousands of lives. The warning was issued after a powerful 7.1-magnitude earthquake that struck off Japan's southern coast on Thursday. The seismic event triggered a tsunami advisory, although initial reports indicated no significant damage or casualties.However, the scientists emphasise that this warning does not indicate that a massive earthquake is imminent.The Japan Meteorological Association (JMA) has issued this advisory under new guidelines established after the devastating 2011 earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear disaster that claimed approximately 18,500 lives.The JMA's ""megaquake advisory"" cautions that ""if a major earthquake were to occur in the future, strong shaking and large tsunamis would be generated"".""The likelihood of a new major earthquake is higher than normal, but this is not an indication that a major earthquake will definitely occur during a specific period of time,"" it added.The advisory pertains to the Nankai Trough, an undersea subduction zone between two tectonic plates in the Pacific Ocean, where significant earthquakes have occurred in the past. The trough extends 800 kilometres from Shizuoka to the southern end of Kyushu island and has experienced destructive quakes of magnitude eight or nine every one to two centuries.Megaquakes are believed to happen in cycles spanning 100 to 150 years and could cause more extensive damage than the devastating March 2011 earthquake and tsunami that struck the northeastern coast of Honshu, Japan's main island.The recent warning pertains to a major earthquake originating from the Nankai trough, a subduction zone where the Philippine sea plate is forced underneath the Eurasian continental plate.Japan has implemented a precautionary warning system that is triggered when an earthquake of magnitude 6.8 or greater strikes an area prone to megathrusts or when unusual shifts in the tectonic plates are detected.The Japanese government has previously said that there is a roughly 70 per cent probability of a magnitude 8-9 megaquake occurring along the Nankai Trough within the next 30 years.In the worst-case scenario, experts estimate that 300,000 lives could be lost, and the damage could reach $13 trillion, with infrastructure being completely destroyed. Geologists Kyle Bradley and Judith A Hubbard have noted that the history of great earthquakes at Nankai is truly alarming.While there is no need for immediate panic, Japan is reminding people living in quake zones to take general precautions, such as securing furniture and knowing the location of their nearest evacuation shelter. Many households in the country also keep a disaster kit on hand with essential items.Although the risk of a second earthquake is elevated, it remains low, with a rule of thumb in California suggesting that any given earthquake has around a five per cent chance of being a foreshock.Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida announced the cancellation of his planned visit to Central Asia on Friday. The decision came after seismologists cautioned that the nation should brace itself for a potential ""megaquake"".Kishida's itinerary included stops in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Mongolia, as well as participation in a regional summit. However, he explained to reporters, ""As the prime minister with the highest responsibility for crisis management, I decided I should stay in Japan for at least a week.""The prime minister acknowledged that the public is likely experiencing significant unease following the Japan Meteorological Agency's (JMA) first advisory under a new system implemented after the devastating magnitude 9.0 earthquake in 2011, which triggered a catastrophic tsunami and nuclear disaster.","Japan's earthquake scientists have issued a warning that the country should be prepared for a potential "" megaquake "" in the future.

Nathan Anderson: Who is Nathan Anderson? Financial sleuth behind Hindenburg research,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/who-is-nathan-anderson-financial-sleuth-behind-hindenburg-research/articleshow/112423390.cms,"Nathan Anderson is the founder of Hindenburg Research, a New York-based forensic financial research firm that specialises in exposing corporate fraud and malpractices. Founded in 2017, Hindenburg Research has gained prominence for its detailed reports on publicly traded companies, often leading to significant declines in their stock prices .Hindenburg Research’s methodology uses fundamental analysis to aid their investment decision-making .They investigate companies that have accounting irregularities, bad actors in management or key service provider roles, undisclosed related-party transactions, illegal/unethical business or financial reporting practices, and undisclosed regulatory, product, or financial issues.The firm is named after the Hindenburg disaster of 1937, symbolizing Anderson’s mission to expose financial “disasters” before they can harm investors.One of Anderson’s most notable reports targeted Nikola Corporation , an electric vehicle startup , in September 2020. Hindenburg accused Nikola of deceiving investors about its technology and capabilities. The report led to a sharp decline in Nikola’s stock value and investigations by federal authorities, including the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).Anderson’s work has drawn both praise and criticism. While many investors and market observers commend his efforts to bring transparency to the financial markets, critics argue that Hindenburg’s short-selling strategy, where the firm profits from a company’s stock price decline following a negative report, raises ethical concerns.Companies targeted by Hindenburg have sometimes responded with legal action, accusing the firm of defamation and market manipulation.Despite the controversies, Anderson continues to be a key figure in financial investigations. His reports have sparked regulatory scrutiny and prompted companies to improve their transparency and corporate governance. Through Hindenburg Research, Anderson has significantly influenced how corporate fraud is identified and addressed in the financial markets.Last year, Hindenburg published a report on the Adani group alleging that the group was involved in stock manipulation and accounting fraud, leading to a massive plunge in Adani’s stock value and triggering regulatory scrutiny across multiple jurisdictions.Meanwhile, Hindenburg on Saturday posted on social media platform X that, ‘Something big soon India’, which has again raised speculations in the Indian market.","Nathan Anderson is the founder of Hindenburg Research, a New York-based forensic financial research firm that specialises in exposing corporate fraud and malpractices.

Hotels and airlines, such as Air France, also reported a decline in bookings.Additionally, the Banque de France acknowledged the uncertainty surrounding its forecast, stating that the positive effect from the Games is countered by the negative impact of the unclear political situation following the inconclusive parliamentary elections in June and July.","French economy is expected to boost from the Olympic and Paralympic Games, according to the French central bank Banque de France.

"Colin Huang, Temu owner’s billionaire founder, becomes China’s richest person",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/colin-huang-temu-owners-billionaire-founder-becomes-chinas-richest-person/articleshow/112391434.cms,"Math Prodigy

Temu Time

Punishing Hours

After several moderately successful ventures in gaming and e-commerce, Colin Huang got sick and retired. At one point, the young entrepreneur stayed home for a year thinking about his next move.The former Google engineer eventually started Pinduoduo , an e-commerce platform known for selling dirt-cheap products with massive promotions, in 2015. He quickly ascended the ranks of the world’s richest people, with his net worth peaking at $71.5 billion in early 2021.Like many so-called Covid billionaires, his fortune collapsed just as fast as it was made, tumbling 87% in the span of about a year.Huang’s decline was especially stark as the slowing global pandemic coincided with China’s abrupt crackdown on the country’s private sector.Then something surprising happened: Huang’s PDD Holdings Inc staged a comeback. Not as big as before, but steady, with its expansion outside of China under the Temu brand name helping counteract a persistently weak domestic economy.As a result, Huang, now 44, has become China’s richest person, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. With a $48.6 billion fortune, he displaces Zhong Shanshan, the country’s bottled-water king who has held the top spot since April 2021.Huang’s remarkable ascent has been fueled by China’s changing shopping habits after the nation’s real estate crisis morphed into a prolonged slowdown. He’s also the first tech tycoon to top the wealth rankings in more than three years, after government pressure on private businesses ensnared rivals like Jack Ma’s Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. Along the way, Huang has also drawn protests from suppliers for driving down prices and set a punishing work schedule for his own employees.“Ma and Jeff Bezos have been corporate leaders in their moments, but the times have changed and Huang is seeing great success with a different, less visible approach,” said Brock Silvers, managing director at private equity firm Kaiyuan Capital.Representatives for PDD didn’t respond to requests for comment.Unlike Ma, the English teacher-turned-founder of Alibaba, Huang represents a new generation of Chinese tech entrepreneurs who started their careers with global opportunities.At 12, his prodigious math talent earned him a place at the elite Hangzhou Foreign Languages School, where he was classmates with the children of China’s political and social elite. After graduating with a computer science degree from Zhejiang University, he left China in 2002 to pursue a master’s degree at the University of Wisconsin.Two years after graduating, he moved back to help set up Google China. He founded his first company in 2007, then sold it in 2010 to start a new one that helped companies market themselves on websites like Alibaba’s Taobao or JD.com. When an ear infection led him to retire in 2013, he hatched the idea for Pinduoduo.PDD “is not about letting people in Shanghai feel like they are living a Parisian life, but making sure that people in Anhui have kitchen paper and fresh fruits,” Huang said in 2018 interview with Caijing magazine. “The goal is not to be cheap, but to make users feel like they got a good deal.”Huang has mainly stayed out of the limelight after he stepped down as PDD’s chief executive in 2020 and left the board as chairman in 2021, as Beijing began cracking down on China’s tech giants. (He said he was pursuing personal interests researching food and life sciences, according to a shareholder letter.)It was around that time that PDD — and his net worth — started to tumble.But Temu, PDD’s offering outside of China, bolstered the company’s top line and underpinned its rebound. It surged to the top of US app stores upon launching in September 2022, targeting inflation-weary Americans with cheap, unbranded products shipped directly from China. PDD reported about 248 billion yuan ($35 billion) in revenue last year, a 90% jump from 2022.“In this economic environment, obviously people are looking for great value for their money, people are looking for low prices,” said Neil Saunders, a retail analyst at GlobalData Retail. “So this is a time to shine for value retailers like Temu.”All that, along with China dropping its Covid-Zero policy in December 2022, has driven a surge in PDD’s valuation. In November, the company surpassed Alibaba for the first time to become China’s second-largest internet firm and the two rivals have been neck-and-neck since.Still, the breakneck growth has drawn scrutiny at home and abroad. Even after a probe into working conditions following the death of an employee in 2021, PDD continues to demand that employees work from 11am to 11pm, six days a week, plus overtime. It’s a variation of the industry’s “996” culture which companies like ByteDance Ltd. and Alibaba steered away from after Beijing’s regulatory scrutiny.Temu’s ultra-cheap offerings also led to growing frustration among some merchants and third-party sellers, who feel the e-commerce giant is increasingly squeezing them for revenue. Things came to a head in a series of public rallies this summer, when, in one case, hundreds of small suppliers yelled slogans outside a Temu office outpost in Guangzhou to protest against what they called unfair penalties the company is levying.Elsewhere, US small businesses have also noted Temu’s rapid growth. The company currently takes advantage of a trade loophole that allows for duty-free shipments up to $800 into the US, by sending small packages from its warehouse in China to individual Americans. Lobbyists are pushing for the threshold to be lowered to $10.Still, PDD has engaged in aggressive promotion campaigns, including spending millions on a 30-second Super Bowl advertisement for Temu. It also has catchy banners on its Temu website, including, among others: “Shop Like a Billionaire.”“Temu at the moment is all about growth,” Saunders said. “Attract people to the site, get them shopping. Then if they become more addicted, maybe then they start to be more tolerant if we push prices up a little bit. So I think for Temu it’s in a land grab era.”","Colin Huang, 44, has become China’s richest person, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

Saudi Aramco quarterly profit dips as output stays low,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/saudi-aramco-quarterly-profit-dips-as-output-stays-low/articleshow/112316710.cms,"Steady dividend

Cash cow

RIYADH: Saudi oil giant Aramco on Tuesday reported net profit of $29.07 billion in the second quarter, a slight drop from the same period last year as output remained subdued.The decrease of 3.4 percent ""mainly reflects the impact of lower crude oil volumes sold and weakening refining margins"", the company said in a statement posted to the Saudi stock exchange.Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest crude exporter, is currently producing roughly nine million barrels per day (bpd), well below its capacity of 12 million bpd.Production averaged 8.8 million bpd in June, Riyadh-based firm Jadwa Investment said last week.The relatively low figure reflects cuts dating back to October 2022, when the OPEC+ bloc of oil producers that Riyadh co-leads with Moscow announced it would reduce output by two million bpd to boost prices.In April 2023, several OPEC+ members announced they would further slash production by more than one million bpd, and in June 2023, Riyadh announced an additional voluntary cut of one million bpd.""Output will remain at similar levels until at least October"", at which point an OPEC+ agreement announced in June 2024 will allow ""for gradual monthly increases"", Jadwa said.Aramco is the jewel of the Saudi economy and the main source of revenue for Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's Vision 2030 reform agenda, which aims to set the Gulf kingdom up for a prosperous post-oil future.The firm's profits help allow Saudi Arabia to finance flagship projects including NEOM, the futuristic mega-city being built in the desert, a giant airport in Riyadh and major tourism and leisure developments.The IMF said in April that, at current production levels, Saudi Arabia's fiscal break-even oil price would be $96.2 per barrel in 2024.Brent, the international benchmark, was trading at $76.43 per barrel on Tuesday after Monday's global stock market rout fuelled by US recession fears.Yet Aramco chief executive Amin Nasser told reporters that Aramco was still ""positive about the outlook for global oil demand"", pointing to ""strong"" demand from China.""The market in my view is overreacting and the fundamentals do not support the drop in prices that we are witnessing today,"" Nasser said.""I think the market is reading too much into the short-term responses to the news coming from the US with regards to the number of jobs.""The government's stake in Aramco, one of the world's biggest companies by market capitalisation, is around 81.5 percent.Aramco's initial public offering in 2019, the biggest flotation in history, raised $29.4 billion, and a secondary offering this year of nearly 1.7 billion shares fetched $12.35 billion.Aramco announced last year it would start paying a performance-based dividend in addition to its base dividend.In May, the firm announced base dividend payouts for the first quarter totalling $20.3 billion and a performance-linked dividend distribution of $10.8 billion to be paid in the second quarter.Those payments will be extended for another quarter and Aramco ""expects to declare industry-leading dividends of $124.2 billion in 2024"", Tuesday's statement said.""We have delivered market-leading performance once again, with strong earnings and cash flows in the first half of the year,"" Nasser said.""Leveraging those strong earnings, we continued to deliver a base dividend that is sustainable and progressive.""Aramco reported record profits in 2022 after Russia's invasion of Ukraine sent oil prices soaring, allowing Saudi Arabia to record its first budget surplus in nearly a decade.But the cash cow saw its profits drop by a quarter last year because of lower oil prices and production cuts, and profits in the first quarter of this year were down 14.5 percent.In January, Aramco said it had been instructed to abandon a plan to increase production capacity to 13 million barrels per day, up from its current level of 12 million bpd.Analysts said the surprise announcement could reflect a lack of confidence in demand, although Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said it was motivated by the transition to cleaner fuels.Saudi Arabia has pledged to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2060, a statement that has drawn intense scepticism from environmental activists.Aramco has vowed to achieve ""operational net-zero"" carbon emissions by 2050, which does not include the emissions from customers burning its products.Nasser told reporters on Tuesday that oil and gas demand ""will not peak any time soon given the vital role that hydrocarbons continue to play in the global economy"".","Saudi oil giant Aramco on Tuesday reported net profit of $29.07 billion in the second quarter.
