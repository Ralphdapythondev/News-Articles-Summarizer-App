When will Sensex hit the 1 lakh mark? Soon! Benchmark index gives returns of 850 times in 45 years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/when-will-sensex-hit-the-1-lakh-mark-soon-benchmark-index-gives-returns-of-850-times-in-45-years/articleshow/113690232.cms,"Having recently surpassed the 85,000 mark, the Sensex is now edging closer to the highly anticipated 1 lakh milestone. (AI image)

The Sensex, India's primary stock market index, has delivered remarkable returns of 850 times to investors over the past 45 years, compounding wealth at an impressive CAGR of around 16%. To put it in perspective, an investment of Rs 1 lakh made at the inception of the Sensex in April 1979 would now be worth an astounding Rs 8.5 crore.Having recently surpassed the 85,000 mark, the Sensex is now edging closer to the highly anticipated 1 lakh milestone.According to an ET report, some of the most optimistic bulls on Dalal Street expect this feat to be achieved as early as FY25.However, if the Sensex maintains its historical average CAGR of 16%, the 1 lakh mark is more likely to be reached around December 2025. To hit this magical level, the Sensex needs to rise another 17.5%.While retail flows have been significant, they may not be sufficient to propel the Sensex to 1 lakh. The next leg of the rally in blue chips is expected to be driven by banks and foreign investors .Vaibhav Porwal, co-founder of Dezerv, states, ""The current market levels are a reflection of market fundamentals and liquidity flows. Fundamentally, the market should deliver 12-15% returns per annum and therefore we expect 18-24 months for markets to get to these levels. However, there is a strong buying momentum in the market that is fueled by strong liquidity. In such a scenario, markets can overextend. Which means that we may see the 1 lakh number shortly.""Seshadri Sen of Emkay Global believes that foreign investors, who have largely missed the bus so far, are now willing to overlook elevated valuations and increase their exposure to India. FIIs have invested approximately Rs 92,000 crore in the current calendar year, compared to Rs 1.7 lakh crore (1.2% of Nifty market cap) in CY23, suggesting room for further acceleration.However, there is also a risk of a decline in FII inflow and a shift of funds to other emerging markets due to their relatively cheaper valuations.Despite this, Dipan Mehta, Director of Elixir Equities, remains optimistic, stating, ""I cannot make out a case for even a 5% or 10% type of correction because whenever there is bad news, there is so much money waiting on the sidelines to buy that it quickly absorbs any correction. Despite the flow of IPOs and QIPs and management selling, the money flow is just too strong.""Last month, mutual funds were found to be holding a cash pile of Rs 1.86 lakh crore. Mehta further adds, ""Portfolio managers also have got a lot of cash to invest and then there are retail investors, small ones from all over the country, wanting to invest in equities. So it is like a waterfall of investors and a huge gush of liquidity coming in.""","The Sensex, India's primary stock market index, has delivered remarkable returns of 850 times to investors over the past 45 years.

MUMBAI: New-age tech IPOs are cashing in on bullish stock market sentiments after anearly three-year lull. With nearly Rs 15,000 crore so far, this year has turned out to be the best for IPO fund-raising since 2021, when the first wave of big startup listings, including Paytm, Zomato & Nykaa, had hit the markets.Six new age tech startups, including Ola Electric and FirstCry, have gone public this year raising a combined Rs 14,571 crore, according to Prime Database and exchange data.In 2021, seven startups had together raised Rs 42,826 crore through IPOs (see graphic) . Swiggy and MobiKwik whose IPO filings have been green-lighted by markets regulator Sebi recently are also in the IPO queue.Swiggy’s Rs 10,000-crore IPO, which is likely to be upsized to Rs 11,700 crore next week, will be the second-biggest startup IPO after Paytm’s Rs 18,300-crore IPO launched in 2021. Logistics startup Blackbuck and electric two-wheeler maker Ather Energy have also filed draft IPO papers as companies look to cash in on robust public markets . Since 2019, about 21 new age tech companies have collectively raised Rs 67,515 crore through IPOs, the data showed.New age tech IPOs are expected to make up 20-30% of the $15-20 billion worth of IPOs estimated to hit the street in the second half of FY25, Neha Agarwal, MD & head, equity capital markets at JM Financial Institutional Securities told TOI. In H1FY25, the markets saw about $7-billion worth of IPOs.“With most startups that got listed in 2021 having now delivered operating profitability with strong visibility on PAT (profit after tax) profitability too in the coming quarters, public market investors have finally understood that these businesses can turn profitable and questions regarding the sustainability of business models do not exist anymore,” said Agarwal.The rush of new age IPOs comes after about a three-year lull when a broader global tech downturn had nudged several startups to go slow on public listing plans with com panies like Snapdeal and Oyo having withdrawn their IPOs. Between 2022 and 2023, only five companies got listed, according to the data. The first wave of big startup IPOs was seen in 2021 when consumer subscription for digital services surged on the back of Covid.Gaurav Sood, MD and head, equity capital markets at Avendus Capital said that about $75-100 billion of tech market cap is estimated to be added to the public markets over the next three years. “After listing, with the churn of cap tables, we have seen domestic asset managers taking up larger stakes in new age companies. This year is poised to be strong for digital companies ... with many more gearing up to file their draft papers,” Sood said.A slew of startups like Zepto and PhysicsWallah are eyeing market debut in the coming year. The secondary market is at an all time high. A bullish secondary market is always accompanied with heightened primary market activity, said Pranav Haldea, MD at Prime Database Group.","Six new age tech startups, including Ola Electric and FirstCry, have gone public this year raising a combined Rs 14,571 crore.

Railway Budget 2024 : The government has wavered little in its efforts to spur a modernisation of railways in the country, pivoting on technology, to support the country’s economic ambitions. In line with expectations, Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore, marking yet another year of successive increase in outlay.That takes forward the past policies and the government’s vision, which have paved the way for modernisation of the transport behemoth.In earlier decades, the government had focused on laying tracks on new routes, electrification and incremental rolling stock capacity addition. That was the need of the hour back then and has helped set up the base for a larger transformation.For instance, the massive Dedicated Freight Corridor ( DFC ) as well as locomotive factories at Marhaura and Madhepura in Bihar were conceptualised over a decade ago and we are seeing their completion now.More recently, the focus has shifted to modernisation—of rolling stock and safety systems, among other aspects.This year, emphasis has also been laid on the railways’ crucial role in industrial development. Commodity-specific corridors have been planned in eastern India and impetus given to port connectivity. Vande Bharat and technology-led upgrades in rolling stock remain in focus. Safety has been prioritised through budgetary allocations for the anti-collision systemKavach . That said, there are other cogs in the wheel that demand attention from a long-term perspective.First, the target for the Operating Ratio, the crucial efficiency gauge, has been set at 98.22% for 2024-25, compared with 98.65% in 2023-24. This reflects an imminent need for operational transformation. An effective overhaul of the world’s fourth-largest rail network will take many years and thus we need to start focusing on improving efficiency and reducing costs now.DFC is almost entirely operational and will be complete over the next few months. To ensure the project achieves its twin goals of reducing logistics costs and enhancing freight efficiency, railways need to attract more cargo on the corridor. This will help increase the rail coefficient and make the railways’ approach more market-oriented, which will in turn aid future corridors.A revamp of railway stations is on track, with sufficient funds dedicated to this end. But even though new coaches and wagons are increasingly being added to meet footfalls, the stations and passenger trains themselves remain synonymous with chaos.Just as safety, comfort and convenience have been prioritised, there is a need for solutions to address the capacity and demand challenges. As a first step, the government could target development of new stations and setting up of new coach production units.As a leading freight mover, Indian Railways carried a record 1,588 MT cargo in fiscal 2024, up from 1,095 MT in fiscal 2015. It accounts for 26% of the cargo moved in the country—by no means an easy feat. The railways aims to take this volume to 3,000 MT by 2030, which would require a 11% CAGR against the around 4.2% witnessed over the last 10 years. As per a report by TERI and Shakti Foundation, from carrying about 62% of freight traffic in 1990-91, Indian Railways’ share has declined to ~27% in 2014-15. This has been due to the expanding road network, cost competitiveness over railways, and door-to-door service. Thus, commencing the cycle of increasing the rail share again is commendable.DFCs, a high-capacity track network, high-power locomotives and improvement in wagon designs have set the ball rolling for larger capacity, faster freight trains that deliver better efficiency.Yet, achieving exponential growth is a tall ask given the current dynamics. Possibly, similar challenges might apply to other goals the railways might have for 2047.To be fair, despite its scale and complexity, Indian Railways has been able to achieve diverse developments at commendable speed.But the track ahead is long and it is time to start discussing the reinvention of the institutional set-up.Indian Railways sees substantial private sector involvement in the form of vendors and contractors. Policymakers could start mulling extreme options such as parallel privately-owned and operated railway infrastructure, coupled with centralised planning and an evolved role for the railways. This will need a robust policy framework from the Government of India.The time is perhaps also ripe to bring user charge and asset monetisation-driven segments for passengers as well as cargo to the discussion table. Globally, the separation of infrastructure and operations in railways has delivered mixed results, for example in the United Kingdom. The model should be analysed and revisited to understand its potential relevance in the Indian context.The key would be to retrace our steps and align our long-term goals to identify not just incremental changes but also ways to explore bold and path-breaking alternatives that put Indian Railways on a smooth track and bring it up to speed.","Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore.

Gradual Change in LTCG Regime?

Budget 2024 capital gains tax changes: The Narendra Modi government is considering suggestions for tweaks in the new long term capital gains tax regime that was announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman in Union Budget 2024.The July 23 budget reduced the LTCG tax on property from 20% to 12.5%. The indexation benefit, which allowed taxpayers to adjust the acquisition cost for inflation before calculating capital gains and thus reduce their tax liability, is proposed to be eliminated for properties purchased on or after April 1, 2001.The government publishes the Cost Inflation Index (CII) annually for this calculation.India Inc is appealing to the government for a gradual shift to the long-term capital gains tax regime proposed in the FY25 budget, which aims to eliminate indexation benefits for property, gold, and other unlisted assets.According to an ET report by Deepshikha Sikarwar, the industry is suggesting alternatives such as a higher tax rate with indexation or a lower rate of 12.5% without indexation, as well as some form of grandfathering for ancestral properties.The finance ministry is currently reviewing these proposals and will discuss them with the Prime Minister's Office. The final decision will be made closer to the date when the Finance Bill reply is to be presented in Parliament, the reports said.Industry groups are expected to submit formal proposals to the finance ministry in the near future.

Budget 2024 adopts multifaceted approach to bolstering manufacturing sector,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2024-adopts-multifaceted-approach-to-bolstering-manufacturing-sector/articleshow/112216383.cms,"By Saurabh Agarwal and Mohit Sharma

Budget 2024 for manufacturing sector : The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth. While the middle class has been offered tax relief, the government's primary focus remains on judicious spending to maximize economic impact. The budget's core themes are employment, skilling, MSME development, and support for the middle class.Largely focus has remained intact on spending money judiciously to ensure that each penny spent creates a ripple effect in the entire economic landscape.Although at first glance, manufacturing might appear to have taken a backseat, a deeper analysis reveals a multifaceted approach to bolstering the sector. Initiatives like employment-linked benefits and internship programs, while primarily aimed at job creation and skill development, indirectly benefit manufacturing companies by expanding the talent pool.Extensive focus on the MSME manufacturing units by way of extending term loan facility for purchase of machinery and equipment without collateral or third-party guarantee, would help companies in augmenting their capital base/ capacity and strengthen the very foundation of the manufacturing ecosystem in the country. Development of a new credit-assessment model by Public Sector Banks to assess MSME credit shall provide much needed regulatory relief to the units.With respect to the large manufacturing entities, while there is no direct fiscal/ tax incentive introduced in this budget, some support has been provided with an extensive focus on development of ‘industrial parks’ in nearly 100 cities under the ‘plug and play’ model. Reforms proposed with respect to land administration, planning and management, shall also ease out acquisition related difficulties often faced by entrepreneurs/ business houses in acquiring lands for manufacturing set-ups.Targeted Customs duty interventions like, rationalization of Customs duty provisions in Mobile phone manufacturing setups, extension of Customs duty exemption on import of capital goods for manufacturing of solar cells and panels, full Customs duty exemption on import of 25 critical minerals,, shall provide the required impetus for enhancing domestic manufacturing environment.Governments’ focus on formulating an Economic Policy Framework to set the scope for next-gen reforms in the country, has a target to improve the productivity of factors of production, namely, land, labour, capital, entrepreneurship and technology. This shall pave the way for enabling achievement of a target of 25% manufacturing sector contribution to the nation’s GDP over the course of next 7-10 years.While the overall outlook is positive, the extension of tax benefits under Section 115BAB for manufacturing entities and the absence of new PLI schemes are notable omissions.The country’s manufacturing base is expanding as is reflective from the continuously increasing tax collections and expanding Purchasing Manager’s Index. It would be pertinent to see how the ground realities evolve vis-à-vis the vision envisaged, in the upcoming Financial Year.","The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth.

Budget 2024: Armed with the vision to propel India to become a developed country by 2047, the Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business thereby providing the required stimulus to the manufacturing sector and enabling large scale job creation.On the Indirect tax front, the industry welcomes the much-needed announcement for a comprehensive review of the rate structure under Customs enabling ease in product classification and dispute reduction.The proposal of lowering of Customs duty on a plethora of raw materials and products including solar cells, critical minerals and bullion are encouraging measures. The rationale behind such reduction clearly indicates support towards domestic manufacturing, deepening value addition and supporting targets in reducing carbon footprint.Relevant amendments under the Customs law have been made to provide increased time limits for re-imports and re-exports to enhance competitiveness of the fledgling MRO sector. The government has extended significant duty reduction and exemption benefits to the healthcare and electronics sectors, continuing the impetus of incentives provided under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme.Since their introduction in March 2020, the PLI schemes have indeed supported in revitalizing the manufacturing sector and strengthening the necessary supply chains. The success achieved in the mobile manufacturing sector has now enabled the Government to reduce customs duties on mobile phones and components, signalling a mature environment. The Budget proposals aim at reproducing similar outcomes for semiconductor and pharmaceutical industry by increasing the budgetary allocation.Buoyed by the increasing revenue collection under GST signalling a shift towards a mature tax regime, this Budget has harmonized the timeframes for the issuance of demand notices and adjudication orders for cases involving fraud, suppression or otherwise. Significant amendments to the GST legislations have been introduced reflecting the recommendations proposed by the GST Council such as regularizing non-levy of GST due to general practice which may turn out to be a breather for certain impacted industries reeling under huge tax demands.The Insurance sector has been provided much relief through the GST council recommendations which have been cemented in the present budget thereby ending long standing disputes on their business practices.The Government's efforts to push forward with its reform agenda are evident as plans to incentivize states for their business reform actions plans and digitalization through the Jan Vishwas Bill 2.0 is proposed. Further, setting up of e-commerce export hubs is envisaged to facilitate easier access to international markets for domestic players.The recent implementation of Budget proposals allows the government to maintain momentum in its reform agenda. These policy measures implicitly reaffirm the significance of India Inc as a crucial element in the development of infrastructure. However, there are still some expectations required to be met to march towards a Viksit Bharat 2047.",The Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business.

Budget 2024 : Real estate, a significant contributor to employment generation, has received a fair bit of attention in Budget 2024-25. Recent years have seen the sector transform rapidly, driven by factors such as favourable government policies, Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, strong economic growth and changing consumer preferences.Added to that, the budgetary focus on job creation, skilling and employment-linked incentives, infrastructure, urban development, rural connectivity, digitalisation and land-related norms, all dovetail to promote growth of the sector.Launched in June 2015, the PMAY aims to provide affordable housing to all eligible beneficiaries. The budget unveiled PMAY Urban 2.0, under which the housing needs of 1 crore urban poor and middle class will be addressed with an investment of Rs 10 lakh crore.The central government’s additional Rs 2.2 lakh crore injection in the next 5 years to make housing more affordable has the potential to revitalise the affordable housing market.Such an approach can play an important role in realising the government's vision of Housing for All and push growth and development. Hence, the significant investment under PMAY Urban 2.0 is expected to alleviate urban housing deficits, spurring construction and economic growth.Steps to introduce technological reforms within the regulatory framework for land, such as digitalisation or GIS mapping of land records, will improve transparency.Rationalisation of stamp duty across states will also be critical to bring in uniformity and initiate land-related reforms such as urban planning, usage and building bylaws.These are steps in the right direction and will boost growth. Moreover, they will improve the ease of property transactions and strengthen municipal finances through increased property taxes. Rationalization of stamp duty with an emphasis on women homebuyers may boost home-buyer sentiment in major cities, too.The budget has also given ample attention to urban and rural development, with rental housing for industrial workers through the public private partnership model, interest subsidies for rental housing, and transit-oriented developments.The proposal to develop investment-ready plug-and-play industrial parks in 100 cities may attract industrial investment, leading to increased demand for industrial real estate and support the growth of ancillary services and residential developments in these regions.Initiatives for industrial parks and rental housing for industrial workers align with the country’s manufacturing goals and addresses worker accommodation needs.These steps are expected to promote industrial growth and stability in labour-intensive sectors, while also creating new opportunities for real estate developers specialising in rental and affordable housing.The changes in long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax, however, have evoked a mixed reaction. The government lowered the long-term capital gains tax from 20% to 12.5%, which is a welcome step. However, this came with the removal of the indexation benefit.The changes could encourage more liquidity in property transactions and potentially increase the effective tax burden depending on the property’s acquisition date.The launch of Phase IV of the PM Gram Sadak Yojana in 25,000 rural habitations will improve connectivity in rural areas, promoting rural development and making these regions more accessible for investment. The primary objective of PMGSY is to build robust, all-weather roads in rural habitations. This initiative focuses on enhancing connectivity and supporting economic development in rural areas.In essence, the budget is geared towards stimulating growth and investment in the real estate sector , fostering a more transparent and investor-friendly environment, and contributing to overall development. It aims to create a balanced and inclusive growth environment by addressing the needs of various segments, including affordable housing, industrial workers and urban infrastructure.The effectiveness of the initiatives, however, hinges on their implementation and continued support of complementary reforms.","The budget unveiled PMAY Urban 2.0, under which the housing needs of 1 crore urban poor and middle class will be addressed with an investment of Rs 10 lakh crore.

New Budget 2024 rule: Why Income Tax Department is likely to issue a huge number of tax notices this month,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-budget-2024-rule-why-income-tax-department-is-likely-to-issue-a-huge-number-of-tax-notices-this-month/articleshow/112186079.cms,"Taxing Times

Income Tax Notice on the way? The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month, as there are concerns that many taxpayers might escape the tax net due to the impending implementation of the new reassessment law on September 1, 2024.According to the amended regulation announced in Budget 2024 , the tax authorities can only go back a maximum of five years to reassess a taxpayer's records if the escaped income is at least Rs 50 lakh, and three years for an amount less than Rs 50 lakh.Previously, they could reassess cases up to 10 years old.According to an ET report, tax officials are now faced with the challenge of compiling and corroborating data on tax and income mismatches for the financial years 2013-14 to 2017-18 within the next few weeks, as these years will become time-barred for reassessment from September 1, 2024.The I-T department relies on information from various sources, such as banks, property registrars, and search findings from the investigation wing, to build reassessment cases.A tax officers' body has raised concerns about the feasibility of issuing notices under Section 148 (or 148A) in a large number of cases within a single month, given the overburdened nature of the jurisdictional assessing officers and the time-consuming process of obtaining sanction from the chief commissioner, who is the specified authority for such notices.Moreover, the law provides taxpayers with the right to explain their position before reassessment orders are finalized, a process that most believe cannot be completed by the end of August.Also Read | ITR refund status for FY 2023-24: How to check income tax refund status online - here’s a step-by-step guide for incometax.gov.in & NSDL websites The Central Board of Direct Taxes ( CBDT ) has been urged by its officers to postpone the effective date of the proposed amendment. However, this suggestion is unlikely to be well-received by corporations and high net worth individuals.""Capping the reassessment period at five years was a great decision as it would reduce hassles and litigation. But if the department fears there could be a genuine loss of revenue as it may not be possible to wrap up several matters by August 31, the government can think of strict parameters where time-bound cases can be selectively reopened - based on trails of steps taken in identifying escaped income,"" said Mitil Chokshi, partner at CA firm Chokshi & Chokshi.""Taxpayers may expect a rush of reassessment notices in August 2024. These notices are likely to be for the AYs 2018-19 and prior to that. It is pertinent to note that the Bombay High Court in a recent ruling in a case of Hexaware Technologies has taken a view on a proviso introduced in 2021, which can be interpreted to mean that AY 2017-18 (and prior years) got time barred on March 31, 2024. These reassessment notices (for AYs 2017-18 and prior) are likely to rake up new interpretation issues in the already muddled reassessment provisions,"" said Ashish Mehta, partner at law firm Khaitan & Co.The current situation is similar to the conflict between the Income Tax office and taxpayers in 2021. The reassessment law was amended in April 2021, allowing the tax office to reopen 10-year-old tax returns if the total undisclosed income exceeded Rs 50 lakh and reassess 4-year-old matters if the amount was less than Rs 50 lakh.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? However, this change led to over 10,000 writ petitions being filed by companies, arguing that they were not given sufficient time to explain and that the notices were issued without considering the carve-out that cases which couldn't be reopened earlier couldn't be reassessed under the new law.The Supreme Court invoked its extraordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution on May 4, 2022, to uphold all reassessment notices issued after March 31, 2021. However, the court left room for judicial proceedings based on the merits of each case, and several such matters are currently pending before the court.","The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month.

Are NPS Vatsalya & hiked NPS deduction limit for private sector employees good moves from Budget 2024?

How NPS will increase tax savings

NPS and EPF: Overlapping services

What is NPS Vatsalaya?

Latest NPS rules, news: In the Union Budget 2024 speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced two new initiatives with regard to National Pension Scheme (NPS) - extension of NPS 14% employer contribution benefits to private setcor and the intended launch of NPS Vatsalya.Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries, bringing it at par with the provisions available for government employees.Sriram Iyer, CEO, HDFC Pension Management told ET that with this move the “ground rules have been harmonised among government and non-government employees, which is a positive step.”Effectively, this means that now, private-sector employees can choose to reduce the taxable portion of employers’ contribution to their NPS corpus, thereby paying less tax and leaving greater funds in their pension deposits.“Employees will benefit from tax savings . More importantly, the 40% increase in contribution will have a significant impact on the terminal value of the retirement corpus,” remarked Iyer. The extended savings will “help in retirement planning, working as an option that is at par with the Provident Fund,” Dinesh Rohira, CEO & Founder, 5nance.com was quoted as saying.Moreover, the endeavour aims to increase NPS penetration by increasing tax incentives for the private sector, providing them a social security-cushion post-retirement.The scheme’s motive to widen the NPS subscriber base may not prove to be flawlessly effective, however. This is explained by Agrees Mrin Agarwal, Founder, Finsafe India: “While it’s good that the limit has been raised, it may not increase adoption as employees need to be educated in a big way. Also, the benefit is only for the salaried opting for the new tax regime,” she says.The mandatory contribution to the EPF, too, threatens to relegate the provisions of NPS under the umbrella of near-superfluity. This sentiment is echoed by Varun Sahay, a software engineer in a Delhi-based IT company: “When 12% of my salary is already deducted for the EPF, why should I put in more in the NPS and cut my take-home pay?”Rohira feels otherwise. “There’s no competition between the NPS and EPF as employees can contribute to both and build a 3-4 times bigger corpus while earning 3-4% higher returns via marketlinked options in the NPS,” he counters.Also Check | New Tax Regime 2023 vs 2024 After Budget: How Much Income Tax Will Salaried Taxpayers Save & How Do New Tax Slabs Compare To Old Regime? Top 10 Points You Must Know To jumpstart retirement savings for children, a new initiative called NPS Vatsalya has been unveiled in the Budget. This scheme allows parents and guardians to contribute to a minor's account, which can be converted into a regular NPS account once the child reaches adulthood.""It provides a very long duration for reaping the compounding benefits and accumulating a huge bounty at a later age. This can be a good way to plan a better future for kids who may not opt for a service segment in the future,"" says Rohira. Sriram Iyer agrees, stating, ""It’s a good move to help the child start his retirement journey. Even if a parent starts when the child is 10 years old, by the time he starts working, it can be a solid foundation for the compounding journey after that.""However, some experts question the utility of a product with such a long lock-in period, especially when parents cannot use the funds for essential goals like their child’s education amidst soaring education costs of 11-12%.""Parents are struggling to save for their own retirement, so it might be a bit of a stretch to expect them to save for their kids’ retirement. The need of the hour is a market-linked product that allows withdrawals only for the child’s education,"" says Mrin Agarwal, Founder of Finsafe India.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? Though the NPS permits partial withdrawals, it allows only 25% of the corpus after three years of joining, and this can be done only three times during the entire tenure. A premature exit before 60 years with 100% withdrawal is only possible if the corpus is less than Rs.2.5 lakh, an amount insufficient for most children's goals.""In its current form, there won’t be any uptake,"" asserts Agarwal. Rohira concurs, ""It’s a vanilla product with a lock-in, which does not make it very attractive and it may not take off. However, the government may optimise it and introduce new features later."" Iyer adds, ""This is just a start and there may be more subscriber-friendly features as we take it to the market. The regulator is proactive and open to feedback.""","Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries.

Gold import duty cut: Why Indians may not find buying gold from Dubai as attractive post Budget 2024,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-import-duty-cut-why-indians-may-not-find-buying-gold-from-dubai-as-attractive-post-budget-2024/articleshow/112097671.cms,"Gold import duty cut: Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group, estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India.

Gold import duty cut in Budget 2024: The recent reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai. Indian jewellers with stores in both India and the UAE believe that the narrowed duty differential will result in lower gold prices in India, making it less attractive for Indians to purchase gold in Dubai.The emirate had attracted gold-enthusiast Indians following a steep rise in customs duty in India in July 2022. In the fiscal 2024-25 budget, the duty on gold imports was more than halved.The duty cut is also expected to boost gold jewellery production in India, particularly the popular 'Kolkatti' jewellery from Kolkata, which is favored by Indian expats in Dubai and tourists from various countries. This move will encourage gold artisans to create new designs in both heavyweight and lightweight jewellery, attracting consumers to purchase gold from India.According to an ET report, Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group , estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India as Indian tourists who previously bought jewellery in Dubai will now prefer to shop in India. However, Indian expats living in Dubai and other customers may continue to buy from the UAE.Also Read | Gold losing sheen?

He points out that the labour cost is significantly lower in India, and with the introduction of mandatory hallmarking and HUID numbers, the purity of gold in India is no longer a concern.Furthermore, NRIs in Dubai do not receive VAT refunds, and Indians travelling abroad only receive about 60% of the VAT back on their gold purchases. Gold trade analyst Bhargav Baidya suggests that the 1% duty differential between gold jewellery in India and Dubai will be offset by Indian jewellers offering discounts to retain and attract customers.Saurabh Gadgil, chairman of PNG Jewellers, notes that Indian import duty is now on par with the US, allowing Indian jewellers to offer competitive prices compared to other countries worldwide. The reduced customs duty is expected to make gold purchases in India more attractive and convenient for Indian consumers, potentially leading to a significant shift in their gold shopping preferences.","The reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers.

Gold losing sheen? The government has reduced its target for issuing gold bonds in the financial year 2024-25 by 38% compared to the previous interim budget goal, according to a senior official. The revised target stands at Rs 18,500 crore, down from Rs 29,638 crore estimated in the interim budget and Rs 26,852 crore (revised estimate) in 2023-24.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told ET ""The decision followed a reassessment of various factors, including investor demand, other investment products and uncertainties around the global economy, as the situation has changed since the interim budget in February.""After accounting for redemptions, the net issuances of sovereign gold bonds are now estimated at Rs 15,000 crore for this fiscal year, a significant decrease from the Rs 26,138 crore projected in the interim budget and Rs 25,352 crore in the revised estimate for 2023-24.Harish Galipelli, director at ILA Commodities India, attributed this shift to retail investors increasingly opting for equities in anticipation of better returns. He also noted that people are uncertain about the potential for further increases in gold prices in the short-to-medium term following a recent rally. Additionally, Galipelli pointed out that savings in rural areas have been impacted by retail inflation and other factors.The gold bond and gold monetisation schemes were introduced by the government in late 2015 to discourage the physical purchase of precious metals and reduce imports, thereby mitigating the negative impact on the current account deficit.The gross collection through these two schemes is now projected to be Rs 20,030 crore in 2024-25, compared to Rs 31,168 crore in the interim budget and Rs 28,240 crore (revised estimate) in the previous fiscal year. Similarly, the net collection is estimated at Rs 16,433 crore, down from Rs 27,571 crore in the interim budget and Rs 26,653 crore in the previous year.

Both schemes were designed to curb gold imports, which, along with crude oil, have been significant contributors to India's current account deficit.

The US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) has approved Bristol Myers Squibb ’s new oral medicine, Cobenfy , for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults. This approval marks the first new type of schizophrenia medicine in several decades that reduces the mental illness symptoms without the common side effects .“Today’s landmark approval of our first-in-class treatment for schizophrenia marks an important milestone for the community.After more than 30 years, there is now an entirely new pharmacological approach for schizophrenia — one that has the potential to change the treatment paradigm,” said Chris Boerner, board chair and CEO of Bristol Myers Squibb. “As we reenter the field of neuropsychiatry, we are dedicated to changing the conversation around serious mental illness, beginning with today’s approval for schizophrenia.”Bristol Myers Squibb plans to make Cobenfy, a twice-daily pill, available by late October. The drug will cost $1,850 per month, or $22,500 annually, before insurance and rebates.Schizophrenia affects around 2.8 million people in the United States, impacting how they think, feel, and behave. Symptoms of Schizophrenia usually appear in early adulthood and vary greatly among individuals, making the condition hard to diagnose and manage. Current treatments can be effective, but up to 60% of patients find them inadequate or experience intolerable side effects.“For people living with schizophrenia, it's often difficult to find a treatment that works for them. Having a variety of treatment options gives patients and healthcare providers the tools to help manage this serious condition,” said Gordon Lavigne, CEO of the Schizophrenia & Psychosis Action Alliance. “People living with schizophrenia want and deserve more. Today’s approval provides a new option as people with schizophrenia move forward with proper support to rebuild their lives.”","The US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) has approved Bristol Myers Squibb ’s new oral medicine, Cobenfy, for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults. This approval marks the first new type of schizophrenia medicine in several decades that reduces the mental illness symptoms without the common side effects.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113730525,imgsize-742684,width-400,resizemode-4/113730525.jpg"

Governments earmarked almost $ 2 trillion in direct investment support for clean energy since 2020: IEA,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/governments-earmarked-almost-2-trillion-in-direct-investment-support-for-clean-energy-since-2020-iea/articleshow/113763074.cms,"Governments around the world have earmarked almost $ 2 trillion in direct investment support for clean energy since 2020, a new International Energy Agency ( IEA ) report revealed.The first edition of the report, State of Energy Policy 2024, said this is almost triple the amount committed following the 2007-08 financial crisis. The report found that around 80 per cent of direct government spending allocated was in China, the European Union and the United States.Government support and incentives for clean energy technologies have reached new highs as policymakers place renewed focus on energy security in the wake of multiple crises in recent years, according to the report.Domestic manufacturing incentives for clean energy are one area of public investment that continues to grow substantially, accounting for almost 10 per cent of total government spending since the beginning of the decade, with low-emissions vehicles, hydrogen and batteries receiving the largest allocations. At the consumer level, the report finds that the cost of short-term government support totalled $ 940 billion at the height of the global energy crisis, the report noted.""The unprecedented level of policy and investment support for clean energy is a recognition that these technologies not only reduce emissions but help safeguard energy security,"" said Laura Cozzi, IEA Director of Sustainability, Technology and Outlooks. ""The increase in trade policies and domestic manufacturing incentives also signals that clean energy is becoming central in industrial policies.""Energy performance standards are another area where policy intervention has grown significantly in recent years. In 2023 alone, 35 countries - representing 20 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions - passed new energy performance regulations.The first edition of the report provides the most comprehensive and up-to-date global picture of energy policies by country and sector, highlighting the most substantial changes in the past 12 months.

Three top technical leaders at Microsoft-backed OpenAI quit on Wednesday, the latest in a string of executive departures this year coming at a time of flux for the ChatGPT maker. Chief technology officer Mira Murati , VP research Barret Zoph and chief research officer Bob McGrew announced their departures via X on Wednesday afternoon.The San Francisco-based AI startup is negotiating a new $6.5 billion financing round valuing the company at $150 billion, contingent on the company upending its corporate structure.The company plans to restructure to a for-profit benefit corporation and will give CEO Sam Altman an equity stake, Reuters reported on Wednesday. Currently, a non-profit board controls the for-profit entity, an unusual structure which led to members of the non-profit board ousting Altman in Nov 2023 over a breakdown in communication and loss of trust. He was reinstated after five days. The funding round has not closed yet and the company is in the process of finalising it.It was unclear whether the executives' departure could affect the ongoing fundraise. Some fundraising documents contain a ""material adverse change"" clause which allows investors to withdraw from a deal if the company encounters anything that could have a significant negative impact.Murati is still working at OpenAI while she negotiates her exit from the company, according to a source close to her.

Export constraints

Economic appeal

MOSCOW: Russia, the world's leading wheat exporter, is expanding its Baltic Sea ports as it aims to boost agricultural exports by 50% by 2030 while reducing dependence on traditional Black Sea routes , officials and executives said.The country, which exported at least 72 million metric tons of grain in the 2023/24 season, is looking at new markets in Latin America and Africa to diversify from its traditional grain markets in North Africa and the Middle East.It has relied on its Black Sea ports to handle booming agricultural exports for the past decades but the conflict with Ukraine has made the area risky for shipping with both sides regularly striking each other's facilities and infrastructure.""Last year with its record harvest showed that with the pace of loadings for exports, we do not have enough capacity,"" Ksenia Bolomatova, deputy head of state-controlled agricultural conglomerate OZK, which owns several Black Sea terminals, told an industry gathering in Sochi in southern Russia.In the last 18 months, Russia has launched two major ports, Vysotsky and Lugaport, in the Gulf of Finland, not far from St. Petersburg, President Vladimir Putin's hometown.Vysotsky shipped its first grain in April 2023, while Lugaport began operations in June this year and capacity is expected to reach 7 million tons by early 2025, according to its owner Novaport.Dmitry Rylko from the IKAR agricultural consultancy said the two ports will be able to handle up to 15 million tons of agricultural exports, including grain, per year.That would account for a quarter of Russia's 60 million tons of grain exports forecast for the 2024/25 season.Private firm Primorsky UPK is also planning a grain terminal at Primorsky port with capacity of up to 5 million tons.Putin set out a goal to increase agricultural exports by 50% by 2030 as part of a strategy to cement the country's position as an agriculture superpower along with Brazil, the United States and China.Russia has become the world's biggest exporter of wheat, corn, barley, and peas in the last decade, but further growth could be constrained by shipping capacity bottlenecks.Many Russian ports announced plans to boost capacity after record harvests in the last two years. The Baltic Sea terminals are expected to expand at a faster rate.""The expansion of the Baltic Sea terminals' capacity is a question of economic and transport security and sovereignty,"" Novotrans said in an emailed comment.Russian trade flows and shipments have so far seen no major disruptions in the Baltic, where 96% of the coastline belongs to NATO members, including Finland and Sweden.By contrast, disruptions are rising in the Black sea and could reduce global grain supplies, according to a report by the World Bank. Two weeks ago, a Ukrainian vessel carrying grain to Egypt was hit by a missile.In August, Russian local authorities said Ukraine sank a ferry carrying fuel tanks in Port Kavkaz, which is also used for transshipment of grain.Russian exported 62 million tons of grain by sea in the 2023/24 season with 90% of supplies going via the Black Sea, mostly to markets in the Middle East and North Africa. This share is set to fall as Baltic Sea infrastructure grows.Baltic Sea ports loaded 1.5 million tons of grain last season, a three-fold increase from the previous season but still just 2.4% of overall Russian exports, according to Reuters calculations based on publicly available data.""Logistically, the Baltic has many advantages for grains exports,"" said Darya Snitko, vice president for Gazprombank, one of Russia's largest banks and one of the biggest lenders to farmers.She said the ability of Baltic terminals to handle bigger ships should help reduce overall costs.""Supplies from the Baltic Sea beat (economics of) shipments from the Azov-Black Sea area when trading with countries in Africa outside the Mediterranean as well as Asia,"" she added.Vysotsky has been sending grain to Algeria, Brazil, Cuba, Mali, Mexico, Morocco, Nigeria and Tunisia, according to data from logistics company Rusagrotrans.",Russia is expanding its Baltic Sea ports as it aims to boost agricultural exports by 50% by 2030.

Jamie Dimon backs Trump policy

MUMBAI: JP Morgan chief Jamie Dimon , who was in India this week to host the company's India Investor Summit , spoke in support of a proposal by US Presidential candidate Donald Trump to have an efficiency commission headed by Elon Musk .""This idea about having an efficiency commission, I actually like the idea. I think govts have to become more efficient, more competent and look at when they take money, what do they get for it?"" Dimon said in an interview to CNBC TV18.Donald Trump has proposed establishing a govt efficiency commission, led by Elon Musk, if he wins the Nov 5 election.The commission would focus on eliminating fraud and improving govt performance, aiming to complete a full financial audit within six months.Dimon's name has been circulating for a senior position in the next US administration if Trump returns to power, after the former president initially mentioned he would consider Dimon for Treasury secretary - a statement Trump later retracted. There has also been speculation that Dimon would take up public service after laying out a succession plan.In response to a question from TOI on whether he would take up public office, Dimon said, ""I never spoke about holding public office. When asked about serving my country, I said what I'm doing now serves my country."" He added said that he would probably be around in his current role next year too.""I can do a great job by building JPMorgan Chase. It is helping our employees, customers, and new businesses. I think it serves your country. When I first came to India in 2005, we banked only 20 companies directly and supported around 100 multinationals.

Global debt hit a record high of $312 trillion at the end of the second quarter, driven by borrowing in the United States and China, while a key debt ratio in emerging markets also scaled a fresh peak, data from a banking trade group showed.The Institute of International Finance (IIF), a financial services trade group, said on Wednesday that global debt rose by 2.1 trillion in the first half to $312 trillion - a new high point after previous data was revised lower.The IIF flashed warning signs on the trend of ever-increasing government borrowing in its latest Global Debt Monitor report, forecasting global government borrowing would rise from its current level of $92 trillion to $145 trillion by 2030 and top $440 trillion by 2050.""With the Fed's new easing cycle expected to accelerate the pace of global debt buildup, a significant concern is the apparent lack of political will to address rising sovereign debt levels in both mature and emerging market economies,"" the IIF report said.A big chunk of the borrowing was driven by energy transition in the face of climate change which was expected to account for over a third of the projected rise by 2050.""This poses significant challenges, as many governments are already allocating a growing share of their revenue to interest expenses,"" the report said.The $2.1 trillion increase this year through June compares to $8.4 trillion in the first half of 2023, IIF data showed.Apart from China and the U.S., India, Russia and Sweden also increased their debt, while other European countries and Japan saw a notable decline, the report said.The global debt-to-GDP ratio - an indicator on the ability to repay debt by comparing to what is being produced - has stabilized around 327%-328%, with output numbers partly buoyed by above-target inflation in major economies.In developed markets, that ratio reached its lowest level since 2018 driven by declines in household and non-financial corporate sectors borrowing.In contrast, emerging markets saw their debt ratio reach a new high of over 245% of output, more than 25 percentage points higher than before the COVID-related lockdowns.",Global debt hit a record high of $312 trillion at the end of the second quarter.
