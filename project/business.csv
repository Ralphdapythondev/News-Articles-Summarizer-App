Who is required to pay the penalty?

Income Exceeds Basic Exemption Limit: Taxpayers whose income exceeds the basic exemption limit will be penalised for late filing. The limit varies by tax regime: Rs 3 lakh under the new tax regime, irrespective of age, and different limits under the old tax regime based on age.

Section 139(1) Conditions: Even if income is below the exemption limit, taxpayers must file an ITR if they meet specific conditions in Section 139(1). These include:

Spending Rs 2 lakh or more on foreign travel. Paying Rs 1 lakh or more in electricity bills. Depositing Rs 1 crore or more in current accounts.

Holding Foreign Assets: Residents with foreign assets or income must file an ITR, even if their income is below the exemption limit. Late filing fees apply in these cases.

Exceptions to Penalties

How is a belated ITR filed?

Income Tax Return Filing FY 2023-24 : For individual taxpayers whose accounts do not need auditing, the last date to file income tax returns (ITRs) for FY 2023–24 (AY 2024–25) is July 31, 2024. Missing this deadline means filing a belated ITR , which comes with penalties and interest.Under Section 234F of the Income Tax Act, 1961, filing a belated ITR incurs a penalty of up to Rs 5,000.For small taxpayers with a taxable income not exceeding Rs 5 lakh, the penalty is restricted to Rs 1,000, according to an ET report. The important thing to note is that this penalty applies even if the belated ITR shows zero tax payable. Additionally, penal interest on the pending tax payable must be paid when filing a belated ITR.Certain taxpayers are required to pay penalties if they miss the ITR filing deadline and they fulfil the following conditions:Also Read | ITR refund status for FY 2023-24: How to check income tax refund status online - here’s a step-by-step guide for incometax.gov.in & NSDL websites Individuals might need to submit an income tax return to receive a refund.

This means the gross taxable income is considered before any eligible deductions are accounted for.The process for filing a belated ITR is the same as filing on time, with the key difference being the selection of Section 139(4) instead of 139(1) on the ITR form.","Filing a belated ITR incurs a penalty of up to Rs 5,000 under the Income Tax Act, 1961.

Gold import duty cut: Why Indians may not find buying gold from Dubai as attractive post Budget 2024,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-import-duty-cut-why-indians-may-not-find-buying-gold-from-dubai-as-attractive-post-budget-2024/articleshow/112097671.cms,"Gold import duty cut in Budget 2024: The recent reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai. Indian jewellers with stores in both India and the UAE believe that the narrowed duty differential will result in lower gold prices in India, making it less attractive for Indians to purchase gold in Dubai.The emirate had attracted gold-enthusiast Indians following a steep rise in customs duty in India in July 2022. In the fiscal 2024-25 budget, the duty on gold imports was more than halved.The duty cut is also expected to boost gold jewellery production in India, particularly the popular 'Kolkatti' jewellery from Kolkata, which is favored by Indian expats in Dubai and tourists from various countries. This move will encourage gold artisans to create new designs in both heavyweight and lightweight jewellery, attracting consumers to purchase gold from India.According to an ET report, Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group , estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India as Indian tourists who previously bought jewellery in Dubai will now prefer to shop in India. However, Indian expats living in Dubai and other customers may continue to buy from the UAE.Also Read | Gold losing sheen? Government cuts gold bond issuance target as investors look at better alternatives Rajiv Popley, director at Popley & Sons, believes that the perception of overseas gold being cheaper than in India is merely a mindset. He points out that the labour cost is significantly lower in India, and with the introduction of mandatory hallmarking and HUID numbers, the purity of gold in India is no longer a concern.Furthermore, NRIs in Dubai do not receive VAT refunds, and Indians travelling abroad only receive about 60% of the VAT back on their gold purchases. Gold trade analyst Bhargav Baidya suggests that the 1% duty differential between gold jewellery in India and Dubai will be offset by Indian jewellers offering discounts to retain and attract customers.Saurabh Gadgil, chairman of PNG Jewellers, notes that Indian import duty is now on par with the US, allowing Indian jewellers to offer competitive prices compared to other countries worldwide. The reduced customs duty is expected to make gold purchases in India more attractive and convenient for Indian consumers, potentially leading to a significant shift in their gold shopping preferences.",The reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai.

NPS and EPF: Overlapping services

What is NPS Vatsalaya?

Latest NPS rules, news: In the Union Budget 2024 speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced two new initiatives with regard to National Pension Scheme (NPS) - extension of NPS 14% employer contribution benefits to private setcor and the intended launch of NPS Vatsalya.Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries, bringing it at par with the provisions available for government employees.Sriram Iyer, CEO, HDFC Pension Management told ET that with this move the “ground rules have been harmonised among government and non-government employees, which is a positive step.”Effectively, this means that now, private-sector employees can choose to reduce the taxable portion of employers’ contribution to their NPS corpus, thereby paying less tax and leaving greater funds in their pension deposits.“Employees will benefit from tax savings . More importantly, the 40% increase in contribution will have a significant impact on the terminal value of the retirement corpus,” remarked Iyer. The extended savings will “help in retirement planning, working as an option that is at par with the Provident Fund,” Dinesh Rohira, CEO & Founder, 5nance.com was quoted as saying.Moreover, the endeavour aims to increase NPS penetration by increasing tax incentives for the private sector, providing them a social security-cushion post-retirement.The scheme’s motive to widen the NPS subscriber base may not prove to be flawlessly effective, however. This is explained by Agrees Mrin Agarwal, Founder, Finsafe India: “While it’s good that the limit has been raised, it may not increase adoption as employees need to be educated in a big way. Also, the benefit is only for the salaried opting for the new tax regime,” she says.The mandatory contribution to the EPF, too, threatens to relegate the provisions of NPS under the umbrella of near-superfluity. This sentiment is echoed by Varun Sahay, a software engineer in a Delhi-based IT company: “When 12% of my salary is already deducted for the EPF, why should I put in more in the NPS and cut my take-home pay?”Rohira feels otherwise. “There’s no competition between the NPS and EPF as employees can contribute to both and build a 3-4 times bigger corpus while earning 3-4% higher returns via marketlinked options in the NPS,” he counters.Also Check | New Tax Regime 2023 vs 2024 After Budget: How Much Income Tax Will Salaried Taxpayers Save & How Do New Tax Slabs Compare To Old Regime? Top 10 Points You Must Know To jumpstart retirement savings for children, a new initiative called NPS Vatsalya has been unveiled in the Budget. This scheme allows parents and guardians to contribute to a minor's account, which can be converted into a regular NPS account once the child reaches adulthood.""It provides a very long duration for reaping the compounding benefits and accumulating a huge bounty at a later age. This can be a good way to plan a better future for kids who may not opt for a service segment in the future,"" says Rohira. Sriram Iyer agrees, stating, ""It’s a good move to help the child start his retirement journey. Even if a parent starts when the child is 10 years old, by the time he starts working, it can be a solid foundation for the compounding journey after that.""However, some experts question the utility of a product with such a long lock-in period, especially when parents cannot use the funds for essential goals like their child’s education amidst soaring education costs of 11-12%.""Parents are struggling to save for their own retirement, so it might be a bit of a stretch to expect them to save for their kids’ retirement.

Though the NPS permits partial withdrawals, it allows only 25% of the corpus after three years of joining, and this can be done only three times during the entire tenure. A premature exit before 60 years with 100% withdrawal is only possible if the corpus is less than Rs.2.5 lakh, an amount insufficient for most children's goals.""In its current form, there won’t be any uptake,"" asserts Agarwal. Rohira concurs, ""It’s a vanilla product with a lock-in, which does not make it very attractive and it may not take off. However, the government may optimise it and introduce new features later."" Iyer adds, ""This is just a start and there may be more subscriber-friendly features as we take it to the market. The regulator is proactive and open to feedback.""","Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries.

Gold losing sheen? The government has reduced its target for issuing gold bonds in the financial year 2024-25 by 38% compared to the previous interim budget goal, according to a senior official. The revised target stands at Rs 18,500 crore, down from Rs 29,638 crore estimated in the interim budget and Rs 26,852 crore (revised estimate) in 2023-24.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told ET ""The decision followed a reassessment of various factors, including investor demand, other investment products and uncertainties around the global economy, as the situation has changed since the interim budget in February.""After accounting for redemptions, the net issuances of sovereign gold bonds are now estimated at Rs 15,000 crore for this fiscal year, a significant decrease from the Rs 26,138 crore projected in the interim budget and Rs 25,352 crore in the revised estimate for 2023-24.Harish Galipelli, director at ILA Commodities India, attributed this shift to retail investors increasingly opting for equities in anticipation of better returns. He also noted that people are uncertain about the potential for further increases in gold prices in the short-to-medium term following a recent rally. Additionally, Galipelli pointed out that savings in rural areas have been impacted by retail inflation and other factors.The gold bond and gold monetisation schemes were introduced by the government in late 2015 to discourage the physical purchase of precious metals and reduce imports, thereby mitigating the negative impact on the current account deficit.The gross collection through these two schemes is now projected to be Rs 20,030 crore in 2024-25, compared to Rs 31,168 crore in the interim budget and Rs 28,240 crore (revised estimate) in the previous fiscal year. Similarly, the net collection is estimated at Rs 16,433 crore, down from Rs 27,571 crore in the interim budget and Rs 26,653 crore in the previous year.

Both schemes were designed to curb gold imports, which, along with crude oil, have been significant contributors to India's current account deficit.

Budget 2024 new NPS benefits: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has announced additional tax benefits for salaried taxpayers investing in the National Pension Scheme . The Union Budget has taken steps to promote retirement planning by enhancing the tax advantage on NPS contributions and introducing a new option for minor children in the pension system .The deduction under Section 80CCD(2) is set to be raised from 10% to 14% of the basic salary. This section permits you to contribute up to 10% of your basic pay to NPS tax-free. Previously, only government employees were eligible for the 14% deduction, but now this benefit has been extended to the private sector as well.“It is proposed to increase the amount of deduction allowed to an employer in respect of his contribution to a pension scheme referred to in section 80CCD, from the extent of 10% to the extent of 14% of the salary of the employee. Further, a non-government employee in the new tax regime shall be allowed deduction of an amount not exceeding 14% of the employee’s salary in place of 10%,” the Budget speech document reads.Also Check | Latest income tax slabs FY 2024-25 For instance, if your basic salary is Rs 1 lakh, your employer can contribute Rs 10,000 (10% of basic pay) to the NPS on your behalf, which is exempt from tax.

Previously, only government employees were eligible for the 14% deduction, but it has now been extended to the private sector as well.As is evident from the table, if your basic pay is Rs 25,000 per month, then the additional tax saved is Rs 624.

However, the higher limit of 14% is only for those who opt for the new tax regime.""With the employers' contribution increasing to 14%, employees will have extended savings now.

Budget 2024 : India's Economic Survey for 2024 revealed the country's infrastructure leap. FY24 capital expenditure has seen almost threefold increase from FY20 with concerted efforts to boost physical connectivity, electricity, water and sanitation, urban development, strategic and digital infrastructure. It also marked emphasis on resource mobilisation from new sources and data aggregation and management for tracking projects and optimal allocation of scarce resources.While capital allocation for major infrastructure sub-sectors like roads, railways, etc. continues as already announced by the government during the interim Budget, the current final Budget heralds a transformative vision for the eastern states with the ‘Purvodaya’ plan, targeting holistic growth with announcements of new roads, power plant, airports, colleges and sports infrastructure.For the shipping sector, the government has announced ownership, leasing and flagging reforms which should improve the share of the Indian shipping industry and generate more employment.Capital projects in the sector uplifts the society at large and generates employment. Brownfield redevelopment of cities and houses for the poor will fuel demand in the sector thereby generating employment and economic growth. Additionally, the government has announced an employment incentive scheme for first time employers to further fillip jobs creation and youth empowerment.From a tax standpoint, the government recognised the potential of cruise tourism in India and in order to give a fillip to this employment generating industry, a simplified tax regime where 20 percent of revenues will be deemed as income from such business will be considered for the purpose of income-tax.India has recognised the need to have a robust MRO ecosystem for the airline and boat & ship sector in view of increased demand. From Customs perspective, the period for export of goods which are imported for repairs and requirement to re-import goods which are exported for repairs under warranty has been extended.The government recognises the need for participation from the private sector in this critical sector including investments from foreign investors. Deletion of angel tax provision is a welcome move which will propel raising of funds in the sector.Second round of VSV gives opportunity to minimise litigation with focus on ease of doing business.On an overall basis, this year’s Budget lays down a framework to propel growth and generate employment with higher involvement of the private sector in upskilling India and some relaxation for individual taxpayers."," FY24 capital expenditure has seen almost threefold increase from FY20.

This, in turn, led to under reporting of income. These individuals offered the overseas income net of tax and at the same time claimed a foreign tax credit (FTC) for taxes withheld overseas against their India tax liability.In short - they got a double advantage.The Budget proposes to amend section 198 of the I-T Act to include income taxes paid outside India for the purpose of computing the income of the taxpayer who is liable to tax in India. This proposal will be effective financial year 2024-25.Parizad Sirwalla, partner and head (global mobility services tax) at KPMG India, said, ""The amendment is more clarificatory in nature. This was always the correct position. As explained in the explanatory memorandum. It appears that some taxpayers (including companies) were not doing so and hence this amendment was introduced making it abundantly clear.""She gives an illustration. An Indian employee of an Indian subsidiary of a German company was granted shares under the global Esop plan. He was eligible to receive dividend of 100 euros on such shares. According to German law, 10 euros was withheld and the balance was transferred to the employee's Indian bank account.""The correct tax position was always to offer the entire 100 euros as income and claim 10 euros as a double tax relief (credit against Indian tax liability on such 100 euros),"" KPMG India's Sirwalla added.Ameya Kunte, founder, Globeview Advisors, points out a few decisions where overseas tax was not held part of the total income assessable to tax in India - these now stand overturned.""The MP high court in the case of Yawar Rashid had held that the tax deducted at source outside India from foreign dividends and interest income was not part of the total income and thus not assessable in the hands of the taxpayer. This HC decision was also relied upon by the Bangalore bench of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal in the case of Sunil Shinde. The proposed amendment makes it clear tax deducted at source outside India, will be part of income.

Budget 2024: Big Relief To Indian Taxpayers | Changes In New Regime Slabs | Nirmala Sitharaman

NEW DELHI: Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Wednesday said most people will be better off under the new capital gains tax structure, despite the indexation benefit being withdrawn for property, and asserted that govt decided on the new structure after undertaking an elaborate exercise.“This perception that you will be at a disadvantage is not realistic, it’s absolutely not correct… In almost every case people have a lower tax burden under this system.The small or the medium people who are going into the market or property investments are going to benefit from it,” she told TOI in an interview.On Tuesday, she had announced a reduction in long term capital gains tax on property and gold from 20% to 12.5%, while withdrawing the benefit to adjust it for inflation. This came with the provision that indexation benefit will be available for properties bought up to 2001.The FM said the amendments have been proposed with the intent to simplify the tax regime and bring all asset classes at par.Sitharaman said the Union Budget presented on Tuesday was a continuation of the interim budget and insisted that the measures announced for Andhra Pradesh were part of the commitments given at the time of bifurcation of the state . “In Bihar’s case can anyone deny the devastation that happens because of Kosi flooding?” she said.She also said that the skilling plan through internship was voluntary for companies and she had received suggestions for such a scheme from various industry bodies. “We're not forcing anybody, we've had a lot of discussion with CII and Ficci and they thought it is possible to do it. It will actually help because they will have industry-ready people, who can be employed.”She hit out at the Opposition, saying, “This brazen method of building a false narrative, repeating it and restating it with the hope that it will stick has been tried in the Lok Sabha elections. They are trying it even now.”Along with the calculations released by the Central Board of Direct Taxes under different scenarios, tax authorities said, “Nominal real estate returns are generally in the region of 12-16% per annum, much higher than inflation. The indexation for inflation in in the region of 4-5%, depending on the period of holding. Therefore, substantial tax savings are expected for a vast majority of taxpayers.”The statement further said that the new regime is beneficial for five-year old properties under the new regime which have seen an appreciation of 1.7 times or more. Similarly, for 10 years, if the value rises 2.4 times the new mechanism is seen to be beneficial. Ditto for property purchased in 2009-10 with appreciation of 4.9 times or more, the tax department said.“It's only where returns are low (less than about 9-11% per annum) that the earlier tax rate is beneficial, but such low returns in real estate are unrealistic and rare (less than 10% of cases),” it said.Revenue secretary Sanjay Malhotra told TOI that benefits of reinvesting the capital gains in a new property and parking the funds in tax-exempt 54EC bonds issued by REC are intact.Asked about the revenue impact, he said that the Centre may end up losing revenue as most taxpayers are likely to gain from the decision.“Simplification of any tax structure has benefits of ease of compliance, including computation filing, maintenance of records. This also removes the differential rates for various asset classes,” CBDT said.","Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman says most people will be better off under the new capital gains tax structure.

Buys Stake In Sister Co

MUMBAI: Tata Steel is set to invest Rs 6,000 crore in Neelachal Ispat Nigam, a metal manufacturing enterprise the T V Narendran-led company had acquired through govt's privatisation programme in 2022.The money will be used to redeem non-convertible preference shares of Neelachal held by Tata Steel and for general corporate purposes. After the fund infusion, Tata Steel's stake in Neelachal - which it had acquired for Rs 12,100 crore - will go up to about 100% from 99%.Neelachal has a 1.1 million tonnes steel facility at Kalinganagar, Odisha , along with iron ore mines of 90 million tonnes. After Neelachal came into Tata Steel's fold, its losses have reduced to Rs 639 crore in financial year 2024 from Rs 1,216 crore in financial year 2022, while its revenues have jumped to Rs 5,562 crore from Rs 260 crore during the same period.On the Supreme Court 's July 25 decision that state govts have power to levy tax on mining activities, Tata Steel said it estimates an impact of Rs 17,347 crore on its books. Since there is no clarity on the period of applicability of this levy, it has listed the amount as contingent liability in its financial statements. In 2005, Odisha govt introduced cess on mineral bearing land.In financial year 2006, Tata Steel received a demand of Rs 129 crore in respect of its mines in Odisha for financial years 2005 and 2006. Subsequently, it moved the Odisha high court challenging the constitutional validity of the state's move. In Dec 2005, the court held that the state doesn't have the authority to levy tax on minerals. Odisha then challenged this judgment before the SC.Tata Steel will acquire 26% in TP Parivart, an renewable energy arm of sister company, Tata Power, for Rs 35 crore. The move is to optimise Tata Steel's electricity cost by replacing grid power with the cost-effective renewable power. In 2023, it had acquired a similar stake in TP Vardhaman Surya, also a subsidiary of Tata Power. According to that deal, Tata Power will set up a solar-wind hybrid power facility at Tata Steel's Jamshedpur facility, replacing a part of the metals major's coal-based power generation.","The money will be used to redeem non-convertible preference shares of Neelachal held by Tata Steel.

ITR filing FY 2023-24 deadline extension: Will Income Tax Department extend the July 31, 2024 deadline for filing tax returns?

The Income Tax Department has urged taxpayers to file their ITRs for FY 2023-24 before the July 31, 2024 deadline. Over 5 crore ITRs have already been filed as of July 26. The All-India Federation of Tax Practitioners requested an extension due to various issues, but it remains unlikely unless significant technical problems occur.

ITR filing FY 2023-24: 49% taxpayers yet to file income tax return; difficulties with ITR website cited as top reason: Survey

As the ITR filing deadline approached, many taxpayers reported glitches on the tax-filing portal, causing significant difficulties. Nearly half of the taxpayers had yet to file, with issues like login failures, unresponsive pages, and inconsistent calculations. Chartered Accountant associations urged the Income Tax Department to resolve these issues and consider extending the deadline.

ITR Filing FY 2023-24: What happens if I file income tax return after deadline? Check penalties, consequences for late filing

Individual taxpayers not needing account auditing had a deadline of July 31, 2024, to file ITRs for FY 2023-24. Missing this incurs penalties up to Rs 5,000 under Section 234F. Penalties apply even for zero tax payable. Specific conditions, such as income exceeding basic exemption limits, oblige filing, while some exceptions allow late filing without penalties.

NEW DELHI: Over seven crore income tax returns filed till 7pm on Wednesday, overtaking last year ’s record of just under 6.8 crore filings by the July 31 deadline. Wednesday was the last date for filing income tax returns for taxpayers, who do not have to get their accounts audited, which includes most individuals.Although several tax practitioners complained of the IT portal slowing down, the numbers do not support their claims as 50 lakh returns had been filed till 7pm on Wednesday.On July 31, 2023, 64.3 lakh returns had been filed according to the tax department’s numbers. The numbers also indicate that the Central Board of Direct Taxes will not extend the deadline for filing returns, something that several individuals were hoping for.Last year, around 8.5 crore returns had been filed and in a post-budget interview, CBDT chairman Ravi Agrawal was confident of surpassing that number. In recent years, compliance has increased, with tax department getting more data on taxpayers and nudging them to disclose true income.

"Fed hints at rate cut as inflation nears 2% target, keeps rates steady at 5.25%",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/fed-hints-at-rate-cut-as-inflation-nears-2-target-keeps-rates-steady-at-5-25-5-50/articleshow/112176592.cms,"The Federal Reserve on Wednesday indicated that progress has been made towards its 2% inflation target , hinting at a potential rate cut—the first in four years. In a statement following its two-day meeting, the Fed noted that ""job gains have moderated"" and acknowledged a rise in the unemployment rate . The central bank, which is mandated by Congress to ensure stable prices and maximum employment, emphasised it is now ""attentive to the risks"" to both goals, marking a shift from its recent focus solely on controlling inflation.The Fed's policymakers unanimously decided to keep the benchmark interest rate unchanged between 5.25% and 5.50%, according to the statement.This decision reflects ""some further progress"" in combating inflation.Despite pressure from many Democratic officials and some economists to lower rates and support the economy , Fed policymakers opted to maintain their key rate at a 23-year high of 5.3%. Some Republicans, including former President Donald Trump, have argued that a rate cut before the upcoming election could appear politically motivated.Ahead of the Fed's announcement, financial markets had fully anticipated a rate cut at its next meeting on September 17-18, according to futures markets. The Fed generally aims to avoid surprising investors with its rate decisions.The Fed is attempting to balance keeping rates high enough to reduce inflation, which has decreased to 2.5% from a peak of 7.1% two years ago, while avoiding rates so high they could trigger a recession. So far, it appears on track for a ""soft landing,"" where inflation reaches 2% without causing a recession.However, with the unemployment rate rising for three consecutive months, some economists argue that the Fed should have cut rates sooner or should do so more aggressively later this year. Bharat Ramamurti, an advisor at the American Economic Liberties Project and former Biden White House economist, expressed concern, stating, ""The finish line is in sight, and it would be tragic for the Fed to stumble and fall, with one-tenth of a mile left in the marathon.""Additionally, three Democratic senators, led by Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, urged Chair Jerome Powell in a letter to cut rates, warning that failing to do so soon could appear as if the Fed is yielding to external pressures, which they argue would also be a political move.Recent data has provided some positive news on inflation, with the government reporting last Friday that annual inflation fell to 2.5% in July, down from 2.6% in the previous month and marking the lowest rate since February 2021. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate has increased nearly half a percentage point this year to 4.1%, and hiring has slowed. Powell and other Fed officials have increasingly highlighted concerns about the job market , reinforcing market expectations for rate cuts soon.The government is set to release the latest employment figures this Friday, with economists predicting the addition of 175,000 jobs in July and the unemployment rate holding steady at 4.1%.","The Federal Reserve kept its key interest rate at a 23-year high of 5.3%.

Boeing names Ortberg as CEO to revive embattled planemaker,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/boeing-names-ortberg-as-ceo-to-revive-embattled-planemaker/articleshow/112173066.cms,"‘Experienced leader’

Leadership shuffle

Boeing Co appointed Kelly Ortberg as its next chief executive officer, entrusting a retired veteran of the aviation industry with one of the most complex turnaround challenges in corporate America.The US planemaker made the announcement as it reported a steep loss for the second quarter. Ortberg, 64, is an engineer by training who rose through the ranks at Rockwell Collins , an aviation supplier that’s now part of RTX Corp .He will take on the new role on Aug. 8.Boeing rose as much as 2.7% as investors parsed the surprise appointment that ended months of uncertainty after current CEO Dave Calhoun announced in March he would step down. The planemaker is working to placate frustrated airlines and win back the trust of US regulators and the flying public after a near-catastrophe in January was linked to a breakdown in quality controls in its 737 factory outside of Seattle.“Ortberg’s appointment is the best news for Boeing in a long time,” said Nick Cunningham, an aviation analyst at Agency Partners in London. “Right now, Boeing needs a company doctor to come in, turn over every stone, tell everyone the bad news, take the charges needed and then bring about an effective turnaround.”This is a modal window.The media could not be loaded, either because the server or network failed or because the format is not supported.Ortberg will take over a company that’s seen its finances badly dented from the fallout of the January accident. The stock has lost 27% in value this year, which puts it on track for its worst annual performance since 2020.Among his biggest tasks will be to “incentivize and foster continuous problem solving and collaboration on the shop floor, said Nicolas Owens, industrials equity analyst at Morningstar Research Services LLC.“The real test for any Boeing CEO will be navigating the very long cycle and high cost of investment in new plane designs, which can be tricky because the rewards accrue in decades, not years,” Owens said.The planemaker said on Wednesday that it burned through $4.33 billion in cash during the second quarter. That’s after a similar outflow in the first three months, as Boeing slowed down output of its commercial jet factories.Boeing’s defense and space division suffered its worst quarter since mid-2023 as costs ballooned to convert a pair of 747 jumbo jets into the next presidential Air Force One fleet. The company said it recorded $1 billion of losses on fixed-price contracts, including a loss on the KC-46 military tanker program.The defense stumbles are a reminder that Boeing’s operational difficulties extend well beyond its crisis-stricken commercial division. The company has gradually been stepping up output in its 737 Max jets under close supervision by federal regulators, but faces another crisis with a strike deadline looming in September for Seattle-area factory workers.The company said it still expects to increase production of the 737 Max to 38 planes a month, and the 787 Dreamliner to 5 a month by year-end.With the appointment, Ortberg steps out of retirement and into the leadership role that many once expected him to play at RTX, one of Boeing’s biggest suppliers and the parent to enginemaker Pratt & Whitney. He briefly ran Collins Aerospace before shifting to an advisory role and eventually RTX’s board in 2020.At Rockwell Collins, Ortberg had a track record as dealmaker — striking his first major acquisition just 11 days after taking over as CEO. He was known for his blunt, no-nonsense style and his effort to flatten hierarchy.“Kelly is an experienced leader who is deeply respected in the aerospace industry,” said Boeing Chairman Steve Mollenkopf, who led the search for the new CEO. Boeing said it waived the mandatory retirement age of 65 for Ortberg, as it did in 2021 for Calhoun.Ortberg was the rare executive to openly criticize Boeing at a time when the US planemaker held huge sway over its subcontractors. Ortberg called out the manufacturer as “delinquent” in 2016, after it abruptly switched payment terms from 30 days to as long as four months, squeezing working capital for its suppliers.He eventually joined the consolidation wave, selling the Cedar Rapids, Iowa-based aerospace company to United Technologies Corp., which later combined with Raytheon Technologies Corp, now RTX. At the time, it was the biggest acquisition in aviation history.Boeing picked Ortberg as it works through one of the most tumultuous periods in the company’s history. In January, a fuselage panel blew out of an almost-new 737 Max 9 airliner during flight, which investigators attributed to missing bolts in the so-called door plug segment.While nobody was seriously hurt in the accident, it set off a cascade of developments, from Calhoun’s departure to a regulatory clampdown to Boeing pleading guilty to felony charges connected to two previous accidents.Calhoun will continue to serve as special adviser until March 2025. As part of his decision to step down, Boeing also named Stephanie Pope as new head of its commercial aviation business earlier this year. Pope, 52, was seen as the most promising internal candidate for the CEO job.“Boeing overall has a long road ahead if the underperformance in this quarter is an indicator of what’s to come,” said Ron Epstein, an analyst at BofA Securities Inc.","Boeing appoints Kelly Ortberg as its next chief executive officer.

Germany's economy unexpectedly shrank in the second quarter , according to data released on Tuesday.The country's gross domestic product ( GDP ) fell by 0.1% compared to the first quarter, the federal statistics office Destatis said.Analysts surveyed by FactSet had previously forecast 0.1% growth for the same period.""Germany’s economic growth in the second quarter was as underwhelming as the country’s modest medal tally at the Paris Olympics so far,"" said ING analyst Carsten Brzeski.The news comes after modest growth in the first quarter had raised prospects of a recovery in Europe's largest economy.Statisticians pointed to weak investment as the reason for the second quarter contraction.Germany's economic slump also stands in contrast to modest growth of 0.3% across the eurozone, according to figures released by the EU statistics agency Eurostat on Tuesday.""Germany is performing very poorly at the moment, especially in comparison with neighboring European countries where we have seen quite robust growth figures,"" said LBBW economist Jens-Oliver Niklasch.""Of course, Germany's export-orientated industry is more exposed to the weakness of the Chinese economy, for example, but many of the problems are homemade,"" he added.Brzeski said that Tuesday's figures ""confirm that Germany is the growth laggard of the eurozone.""""Looking ahead, the German economy will continue to hover between hope and despair,"" he said.""With both the US and the Chinese economies losing momentum, along with new trade tensions, there is very little hope for a strong export-driven recovery.""Although the German Council of Economic Experts has forecast growth of around 0.2% for the year overall, the economy nevertheless faces a number of other headwinds like a shortage of skilled labor, high energy prices, and an automotive industry that is racing to adapt to electric mobility.""The triple decline in the ifo business climate and the weakness of other economic indicators suggest anemic growth at best for the second half of the year,"" said Commerzbank chief economist Jörg Krämer.","Germany's economy unexpectedly shrank in the second quarter, according to data released on Tuesday.

Russia to allow crypto payments in international trade to counter sanctions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/russia-to-allow-crypto-payments-in-international-trade-to-counter-sanctions/articleshow/112153953.cms,"Russian lawmakers on Tuesday approved legislation that enables companies to utilize cryptocurrencies for international trade transactions . This move is part of Russia's efforts to circumvent Western sanctions imposed following its invasion of Ukraine.The legislation is anticipated to take effect in September, and according to Elvira Nabiullina , the governor of the Russian central bank and one of the law's supporters, the initial cryptocurrency transactions will occur before the end of the year.Russia has encountered significant delays in international payments with major trading partners such as China, India, and the United Arab Emirates, as banks in those countries have become more cautious due to pressure from Western regulators.Anatoly Aksakov , the head of the Duma lower house of parliament, declared to lawmakers, ""We are taking a historic decision in the financial sphere.""Under the new law, the central bank will establish a new ""experimental"" infrastructure for cryptocurrency payments, although the specifics of this infrastructure have not yet been disclosed. The law is part of a broader package that also includes regulations on cryptocurrency mining and the circulation of other digital assets. However, the existing ban on cryptocurrency payments within Russia will remain in place.The central bank reported that payment delays have become a significant challenge for the Russian economy, resulting in an 8% decrease in Russian imports during the second quarter of 2024. Despite Russia's attempts to switch to the currencies of its trading partners and develop an alternative payment system within the BRICS group of emerging economies, many payments still involve dollars and euros and are processed through the international SWIFT system.This situation exposes banks in countries trading with Russia to the risk of secondary sanctions, compelling them to strengthen their compliance procedures. Nabiullina emphasized, ""The risks of secondary sanctions have grown. They make payments for imports difficult, and that concerns a wide range of goods,"" highlighting that payment delays have resulted in longer supply chains and increased costs.","Russian lawmakers on Tuesday approved legislation that enables companies to utilize cryptocurrencies for international trade transactions.

McDonald's sales decline for first time in more than three years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/mcdonalds-sales-decline-for-first-time-in-more-than-three-years/articleshow/112124967.cms,"McDonald's global sales declined by 1% in the second quarter against a 0.5% rise, the first time in 13 quarters primarily due to consumers seeking more affordable options due to persistent inflation , particularly among lower-income households. Its overall revenue rose 1%.This has forced fast food giants McDonald's, Burger King, Wendy's and Taco Bell to come up with value meals to increase customer traffic.However, despite the setback, McDonald's shares rose nearly 4% following the announcement of the successful $5 meal deal launched in June, which the company plans to extend beyond August in collaboration with its franchisees.The fast food chain said that remains committed to its 2024 forecast of an operating margin in the mid-to-high 40% range and plans to be more selective with price increases to maintain profitability.""Even though things (traffic) are soft now, they should be getting better in the back half of the year ... with better value on the menu,"" said Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management.CEO Chris Kempczinski said that consumers have become more deal-oriented and discriminating, with consumer sentiment remaining low in most major markets.""The biggest hit for McDonald's is the low-income consumer has really cut back on visits and that is more than offsetting the typical trade down McD normally sees in tougher economic times,"" said Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough.US comparable sales fell 0.7% in the quarter ended June 30 against the 10.3% increase a year ago.

The company's business segment, where restaurants are operated by local partners, saw a 1.3% decrease in sales compared to a 14% jump a year earlier, attributed to a slower-than-expected recovery in China and the ongoing conflict in the Middle East.Despite the challenges, McDonald's is maintaining its capital expenditure budget of up to $2.7 billion, with more than half allocated to new restaurant openings in the US and international markets.

Each presale purchase gives them a chance to pick a meme athlete and win a twenty five percent token multiplier.Taking advantage of the unlimited entries, investors can join the presale as often as possible. It maximises the chances of winning.Staking offers a thrilling opportunity to put the tokens to work right from the beginning. It is active from the presale stage. Whether investors get lucky and unlock the token multiplier or not, staking will continue to accumulate rewards.Staked tokens have a brief seven-day lock-up window. The mechanism prevents early sell-offs to strengthen the price trajectory. Toward the end of the lock-up window, the tokens can potentially go multifold up the charts.With the meme coin market rebounding, $MGMES tokens are predicted to explode on their release. Potential interest rate cuts in September will encourage more investors to dive into the market for quick gains.The $MGMES staking APYs are dynamically structured to favour early investors. They are eligible for lower presale prices as well.","The Meme Games ($MGMES), touted as the Olympics meme coin, has ignited the latest crypto frenzy.
