Ayushman Bharat: PM Narendra Modi-led Cabinet has recently approved the extension of Ayushman Bharat to all senior citizens aged 70 and above. These senior citizens will now be eligible for health insurance coverage under the Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana ( AB PM-JAY ), irrespective of their income.The Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB PM-JAY) has been steadily increasing its beneficiary base since its inception.The scheme initially covered 10.74 crore poor and vulnerable families, representing the bottom 40% of India's population, says the government.In January 2022, the Government of India expanded the beneficiary base to 12 crore families, taking into account the country's decadal population growth of 11.7% over the 2011 population.Furthermore, the scheme now includes 37 lakh ASHAs, AWWs, and AWHs working across the country and their families, providing them with free healthcare benefits.“Taking the mission ahead, AB PM-JAY would now provide free healthcare coverage of Rs 5 lakh to all citizens of the age-group of 70 years and above across the country,” said the government release.Senior citizens who are already part of families covered under AB PM-JAY will receive an additional top-up cover of up to Rs 5 lakh per year for themselves, which they do not have to share with other family members below the age of 70. Other senior citizens aged 70 and above will be provided with a cover of up to Rs 5 lakh per year on a family basis, according to an ET report.Those who are already benefiting from other public health insurance schemes such as Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS), Ex-Servicemen Contributory Health Scheme (ECHS), or Ayushman Central Armed Police Force (CAPF) can either continue with their existing scheme or opt for AB PM-JAY.It has also been clarified that senior citizens aged 70 and above who are covered under private health insurance policies or the Employees' State Insurance scheme will still be eligible for benefits under AB PM-JAY.This initiative is expected to benefit approximately 4.5 crore families, including six crore senior citizens, by providing them with free health insurance cover of up to Rs 5 lakh on a family basis.To apply for the Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana, eligible individuals should follow these steps:1. Visit the official website at https://abdm.gov.in/2. Get your Aadhaar card or ration card verified at a PMJAY kiosk3. Submit family identification proofs4.

The fee for updating a mobile number is Rs 50 per request, which can include one or more demographic updates.""Residents who had got their Aadhaar issued 10 years ago, and have never updated after that in these years, such Aadhaar number holders are encouraged to get their documents updated. The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) has previously issued a press release underlining that it is urging and encouraging residents to keep their documents updated. The recently issued gazette notification also clearly mentions that residents ""may"" do so on completion of every 10 years. Keeping the documents in Aadhaar updated helps in ease of living, better service delivery, and enables accurate authentication. UIDAI has always encouraged residents to keep their documents updated, and the gazette notification is another step in that direction,"" states a PIB release from November 10, 2022.","The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) has been urging citizens to review and update their Aadhaar card information, especially for those who obtained their cards more than a decade ago and haven't made any changes since then.

On ICICI ESOPs

On pension amounts drawn

NEW DELHI: Securities and Exchange Board of India ( Sebi ) chief Madhabi Puri Buch and her husband Dhaval Buch on Friday issued a joint statement amid allegations by US short-seller Hindenburg Research saying that she adhered to all disclosure and recusal guidelines set by the markets regulator.""Madhabi has never dealt with any file involving Agora Advisory , Agora Partners, the Mahindra Group , timesofindia Pidilite , Dr Reddy’s , Alvarez and Marsal, Sembcorp, Visu Leasing or ICICI Bank at any stage after her joining Sebi,"" the statement read.Terming the allegations ""false, incorrect, malicious and motivated"", the statement said that the allegations are ""based on our Income Tax Returns"" which ""clearly have been obtained by adopting fraudulent means and illegally"".The Buchs said it was ""a clear breach of not only our right to privacy (which is a fundamental right) but also a violation of the Income Tax Act. The facts, transparently reflected in our income tax returns, have been twisted deliberately to create a false narrative.""In the statement, it has been claimed that after Dhaval's retirement, ""he undertook his consulting practice under the two companies Agora Advisory and Agora"" and that his assignments were undertaken ""under company structure"" to ensure transparency by isolating income generated and report accruals and assignment-related expenses.""It is unfortunate that a process that actually facilitates greater transparency is being sought to be projected as suspicious"", the duo said in a statement.The duo also issued a clarification on the rental income they received from a property that was leased out -- where the lessee happened to be an associate of Wokhardt, a listed company which had come under probe.In the joint statement, it has been claimed that ""Madhabi has not dealt with any files related to Wockhardt"".""Given the all-India remit of SEBI's responsibilities, which encompass hundreds of investigations, thousands of surveillance alerts, hundreds of approvals, and hundreds of orders annually, the Chairperson is usually not even aware of specific cases, as they are handled in the normal course by other designated officials as per Delegation of Powers which have always been in place,"" the statement read.They said that the ""rental agreement for the property in question was concluded inaccordance with standard market practices and this property jointly owned by Madhabiand Dhaval is leased and the rental from the same is declared and tax paid accordingly"".The couple has said that ""even an allegation of conflict is not only defamatory, false and vexatious, but is clearly malicious and motivated"".On charges linked to ICICI ESOPs that it can only be exercise in three months, the statement said ""the provisions of ICICI Bank's ESOP scheme were different for resigning and retiring employees"".The statement said that Madhabi, like other senior employees, received ESOPs during her tenure and that only employees ""who resigned were required to exercise their vested options within three months"".Replying to the allegations concerning uneven nature of pension amounts with gaps in between, the duo said ""pension payments were consistent"" and that they were part of ""a contributory Annuity Scheme from ICICI Prudential"".""The uneven amounts related to exercise of ESOPS at various stages over the ten years. Depending on when Madhabi exercised her options and the prevailing market prices at the relevant time and the quantity of ESOPs exercised, the perquisite value is bound to vary each year,"" the statement read.""If no ESOPs were exercised in a given year, there would be zero value attached to it and this would be bound to be reflected in the returns as a gap year. This perquisite value is required to be filed under the ""Salary"" category both by ICICI Bank and by the ex-employee. This is a clear law of the land,"" they added.","Madhabi Puri Buch and her husband Dhaval Buch issued a joint statement amid allegations by US short-seller Hindenburg Research.

Fixed deposit rates above 8%: Several small finance banks (SFBs) have increased their fixed deposit rates to over 8% for a two-year tenure as they compete with larger banks like State Bank of India and HDFC Bank to attract funds from regular savers in a market where alternative investment options have grown in recent years.SFBs are providing 100-125 basis points more on deposits compared to a year ago, which is also about 120 basis points higher than what major banks such as SBI and HDFC Bank are offering.According to an ET report, Utkarsh SFB and Suryoday SFB are offering 8.5% on two-three year tenures, while Equitas SFB is offering 8.5% on a tenure of two years to less than three years. Unity SFB is offering 9% on 1,001 days.In comparison, SBI's highest rate is 7.25% for 444 days, and HDFC Bank's highest rate is 7.4%, with an additional 50 bps for senior citizens.Some finance companies are also competing with banks by offering above 8% interest on fixed deposits .

Check list Kanika Pasricha, chief economic advisor at Union Bank of India, was quoted as saying, ""Deposits are still lagging on an incremental basis, and this is a cause for concern. Therefore, since July, the fight has intensified among banks to raise deposit rates. With deposits lagging, borrowings like infrastructure bonds have suddenly picked up.""India's financial market is imbalanced due to the opposing trends in the demand for and availability of funds, which an economist attributed to the RBI's strict monetary policy aimed at reducing inflation to the legally required 4%.Moreover, the attractive returns offered by growth assets have contributed to the democratization of India's equity culture, diverting funds from traditional bank deposits to pooled assets like various mutual funds and exchange-traded funds.",SFBs are providing 100-125 basis points more on deposits compared to a year ago.

Source: ET quoting Paisabazaar for interest rates data as on August 14, 2024.

Highest Fixed Deposit Interest Rates: Fixed deposits (FDs) offered by banks are secure and interest-generating investment options. With FDs, you can expect a guaranteed return on your invested funds, which remain unaffected by market fluctuations. This is the reason that FDs are a go to investment option for most risk averse investors.Interest rates for fixed deposits are near all time highs, with RBI pausing the rate cycle for several monetary policy meetings now.Investors have the flexibility to choose between the re-investment deposit option, which allows for the accumulation of compound interest, or the option to receive interest payments at regular intervals (monthly/quarterly) to support their financial planning and budgeting needs, notes an ET report.The interest rates offered on fixed deposits in August 2024 can vary based on several factors, including the specific bank, the age of the depositor, the tenure of the deposit, and the amount invested.In India, private banks are financial institutions where private companies or individuals hold the majority of the equity, in contrast to public-sector banks where the government is the primary shareholder.Public Sector Undertaking (PSU) banks are ones where the government owns the majority of the shares.

September 2024 bank holidays: Are banks closed for Onam? In India, all banks, including cooperative, rural, regional, private, and public-sector banks, are closed on the second and fourth Saturdays of each month, as per the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) guidelines. Additionally, banks remain closed on all Sundays and on national and regional holidays.September 14, 2024 is the second Saturday of the month, and therefore, banks will be closed.However, even if it were not a second Saturday, banks in the states of Kerala and Jharkhand would still be closed due to Onam and Karma Puja celebrations, respectively, according to an ET report.The RBI categorizes certain holidays under the Negotiable Instruments Act, Real-Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) holidays, and Banks' Closing of Accounts.Onam, a significant annual harvest and cultural festival, is widely celebrated by the people of Kerala. It is considered the official festival of the state and involves various cultural activities. The date of Onam is determined by the Panchangam and falls on the 22nd nakshatra Thiruvonam in the month of Chingam according to the Malayalam calendar, which corresponds to the period between August and September in the Gregorian calendar.In September 2024, banks will be closed for 15 days, depending on the state, due to various occasions such as Tirubhav Tithi of Srimanta Sankardeva, Ganesh Chaturthi, First Onam, Milad-un-Nabi or Id-e Milad, Indrajatra/Id-e-Milad, Pang-Lhabsol, Friday following Eid-i-Milad-ul-Nabi, Sree Narayana Guru Samadhi Day, and Birthday of Maharaja Hari Singh Ji.On these specified holidays, bank operations cannot be conducted, and physical banking services are unavailable.

D-St to track US Fed’s rate decision this week,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/d-st-to-track-us-feds-rate-decision-this-week/articleshow/113377585.cms,"MUMBAI: Dalal Street investors, like their global counterparts, are awaiting the US Federal Reserve’s Sept 18 meeting, which could decide the direction of markets around the world. While it is almost a given that the US Fed is going to cut interest rates , the quantum of the reduction could be a deciding factor, market players said.In the new week, the Bank of Japan , too, will decide on whether to change its interest rates, which will also impact markets globally.The US Fed and BoJ are poised to move in opposite directions on rates.In addition, the listing of Bajaj Housing Finance — which set several records for the IPO segment of India — will also decide how investors look at other offers in the pipeline.The impact of the US Fed’s rate decision on Sept 18 will be felt in the Indian market on Thursday. “With a 25 basis points (100 basis points =1 percentage point) rate cut already priced in, a significant market reaction is unlikely. The Fed’s guidance on inflation, growth, and future rate cuts will be key in shaping broader market sentiment, particularly regarding global liquidity and risk appetite,” said Ajit Mishra, SVP (research), Religare Broking. “A 50 bps cut could spark a positive reaction, especially in emerging mar kets like India. However, this effect may be short-lived as it could also raise concerns about the underlying strength of the US economy.”The decision on rates by BoJ is set for Friday, when Indian markets will be open. Any decision to hike rates could trigger another round of unwinding of speculative contracts based on Japanese yen (called yen carry trade) and have the potential to trigger high volatility in global markets, like the one witnessed in early Aug, market players said.Indian investors are also awaiting the WPI numbers due in the week. The domestic market would be impacted by how foreign funds position themselves after the decisions by the US Fed and the BOJ.The listing of Bajaj Housing Finance, set for Monday, would decide the Street’s direction relating to IPOs. On Sunday night, the grey market premium for the stock — that gives some indications about the listing of a stock — was hovering around Rs 76 per share, while the IPO price was set at Rs 70. Going by this, investors are expected to double their money on listing.The week would also witness the listing of PN Gadgil Jewellers, which had a strong IPO as well. Investors will have the option of investing in at least seven IPOs in the week, data on BSE and NSE showed.","The US Fed and BoJ are poised to move in opposite directions on rates.

The massive increase in international flights by both IndiGo and Tata's Air India Group , apart from new player Akasa and new international airlines flying to the country, has changed the nature of traffic with more passengers now travelling on non-stops rather than making one or two stops at a hub airport, says UK-based air consultancy firm OAG while comparing pre-Covid 2019 with 2023.In 2023, India's international air traffic was about 6.5 crore, only 6 lakh less than 2019 numbers. About ""3.7 crore passengers made a non-stop trip in 2023, 20 lakh more than in 2019. Indirect passengers dropped by 25 lakh to 2.7 crore in the same period.

For example, someone travelling between Kathmandu and New York via Delhi. Also, with many countries like Vietnam and Indonesia now having direct flights to and from India, there's no longer a need to fly one-stop unless someone opts for the latter.""An analysis of which hubs lost traffic from 2019 to 2023 shows Middle Eastern hubs losing 10 lakh indirect passengers.

Oberoi case: Delhi HC halts transfer of EIH shares,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/oberoi-case-delhi-hc-halts-transfer-of-eih-shares/articleshow/113377524.cms,"NEW DELHI: A dispute among children of veteran hotelier PRS 'Biki' Oberoi has landed before the Delhi high court , which last week passed an interim order restraining EIH and its holding companies - Oberoi Hotels (OHPL), Oberoi Properties (OPPL) - from transferring its shares.The court was dealing with a suit filed by PRS Oberoi 's daughter Anastasia against her siblings and a cousin over control of the family's substantial holdings in EIH, which manages the Oberoi and Trident hotel chains and PRS Oberoi's will.She and her mother Mirjana Jojic Oberoi have filed the suit against her brother Vikramjit, sister Natasha, and cousin Arjun among others. The suit alleges that Vikramjit and Arjun, in conspiracy with the executors appointed by their late father, were attempting to obstruct the execution of his will.On Sept 12, Justice Navin Chawla issued an interim order in favour of Anastasia and passed the injunction in connection with the shares held by PRS Oberoi, and protected Anastasia's and her mother's continued possession of their family home. The HC said Anastasia has been able to make out a ""good prima facie case in their favour"" and the plaintiffs will suffer grave irreparable harm in case the shares and properties are alienated.While passing the interim order, HC also said there is sufficient material placed on record by the plaintiffs to demonstrate the prima facie reliability of the will. The case revolves around the control of the family's substantial holdings in EIH, and a family villa at Bijawasan in Kapashera in Delhi.Through the suit filed by Anastasia and her mother they have sought directions to declare they are entitled to own, hold, enjoy and exercise all rights in 1600 A-class shares and 62,075 B-Class shares of Oberoi Hotels and 100 A-Class shares and 2,600 B-Class shares of Oberoi Properties. According to the suit, PRS Oberoi bequeathed moveable properties, including shares and interests in the three holding companies - OHPL, OPPL and Aravali Polymers - to his two daughters. While one half went to his daughter Natasha, the other went to AO Trust, whose sole beneficiary is Anastasia.As regards the villa at Bijawasan, his will bequeathed it to Aashiana Trust, where again Anastasia is a sole benefactor and trustee along with her mother and another trustee Anmol Joshi, all of whom are plaintiffs in her suit.The plaintiffs say they are apprehensive that other family members may sell the shares in the company and contended that instead of exploring the option of transfer of the shares held by the PRS Oberoi in OHPL and OPPL, the executors of the will, which includes Natasha, may sell those shares to Vikramjit and Arjun at a price that would be determined by them, defeating the purpose of the will itself. Therefore, the suit also sought direction to grant a decree of permanent injunction against Rajaraman Shankar, Daniel Lee Farrugia, Natasha Devi Oberoi and Oberoi Hotels and Oberoi Properties, from registering any transfer or transmission of shares held by PRS Oberoi in Oberoi Hotels and Oberoi Properties other than in favour of the legatees under the last will dated Oct 25, 2021 read with codicil dated Aug 27, 2022.The counsel appearing for the Vikramjit and Arjun opposed the plea and contended that the suit itself isn't maintainable. They also argue that shares can be transferred to a blood relative and not to a trust as Oberoi's Will directed. While granting the injunction HC clarified that Rajaraman Shankar (COO Oberoi Hotel Groups) may exercise his voting rights only for the purpose of ensuring statutory compliance and filing statutory reports.","The case revolves around the control of the family's substantial holdings in EIH, and a family villa at Bijawasan in Kapashera in Delhi.

Railway Budget 2024 : The government has wavered little in its efforts to spur a modernisation of railways in the country, pivoting on technology, to support the country’s economic ambitions. In line with expectations, Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore, marking yet another year of successive increase in outlay.That takes forward the past policies and the government’s vision, which have paved the way for modernisation of the transport behemoth.In earlier decades, the government had focused on laying tracks on new routes, electrification and incremental rolling stock capacity addition. That was the need of the hour back then and has helped set up the base for a larger transformation.For instance, the massive Dedicated Freight Corridor ( DFC ) as well as locomotive factories at Marhaura and Madhepura in Bihar were conceptualised over a decade ago and we are seeing their completion now.More recently, the focus has shifted to modernisation—of rolling stock and safety systems, among other aspects.This year, emphasis has also been laid on the railways’ crucial role in industrial development. Commodity-specific corridors have been planned in eastern India and impetus given to port connectivity. Vande Bharat and technology-led upgrades in rolling stock remain in focus. Safety has been prioritised through budgetary allocations for the anti-collision systemKavach . That said, there are other cogs in the wheel that demand attention from a long-term perspective.First, the target for the Operating Ratio, the crucial efficiency gauge, has been set at 98.22% for 2024-25, compared with 98.65% in 2023-24. This reflects an imminent need for operational transformation. An effective overhaul of the world’s fourth-largest rail network will take many years and thus we need to start focusing on improving efficiency and reducing costs now.DFC is almost entirely operational and will be complete over the next few months. To ensure the project achieves its twin goals of reducing logistics costs and enhancing freight efficiency, railways need to attract more cargo on the corridor. This will help increase the rail coefficient and make the railways’ approach more market-oriented, which will in turn aid future corridors.A revamp of railway stations is on track, with sufficient funds dedicated to this end. But even though new coaches and wagons are increasingly being added to meet footfalls, the stations and passenger trains themselves remain synonymous with chaos.Just as safety, comfort and convenience have been prioritised, there is a need for solutions to address the capacity and demand challenges. As a first step, the government could target development of new stations and setting up of new coach production units.As a leading freight mover, Indian Railways carried a record 1,588 MT cargo in fiscal 2024, up from 1,095 MT in fiscal 2015. It accounts for 26% of the cargo moved in the country—by no means an easy feat. The railways aims to take this volume to 3,000 MT by 2030, which would require a 11% CAGR against the around 4.2% witnessed over the last 10 years. As per a report by TERI and Shakti Foundation, from carrying about 62% of freight traffic in 1990-91, Indian Railways’ share has declined to ~27% in 2014-15. This has been due to the expanding road network, cost competitiveness over railways, and door-to-door service. Thus, commencing the cycle of increasing the rail share again is commendable.DFCs, a high-capacity track network, high-power locomotives and improvement in wagon designs have set the ball rolling for larger capacity, faster freight trains that deliver better efficiency.Yet, achieving exponential growth is a tall ask given the current dynamics. Possibly, similar challenges might apply to other goals the railways might have for 2047.To be fair, despite its scale and complexity, Indian Railways has been able to achieve diverse developments at commendable speed.But the track ahead is long and it is time to start discussing the reinvention of the institutional set-up.Indian Railways sees substantial private sector involvement in the form of vendors and contractors. Policymakers could start mulling extreme options such as parallel privately-owned and operated railway infrastructure, coupled with centralised planning and an evolved role for the railways. This will need a robust policy framework from the Government of India.The time is perhaps also ripe to bring user charge and asset monetisation-driven segments for passengers as well as cargo to the discussion table. Globally, the separation of infrastructure and operations in railways has delivered mixed results, for example in the United Kingdom. The model should be analysed and revisited to understand its potential relevance in the Indian context.The key would be to retrace our steps and align our long-term goals to identify not just incremental changes but also ways to explore bold and path-breaking alternatives that put Indian Railways on a smooth track and bring it up to speed.","Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore.

Budget 2024 capital gains tax changes: The Narendra Modi government is considering suggestions for tweaks in the new long term capital gains tax regime that was announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman in Union Budget 2024.The July 23 budget reduced the LTCG tax on property from 20% to 12.5%. The indexation benefit, which allowed taxpayers to adjust the acquisition cost for inflation before calculating capital gains and thus reduce their tax liability, is proposed to be eliminated for properties purchased on or after April 1, 2001.The government publishes the Cost Inflation Index (CII) annually for this calculation.India Inc is appealing to the government for a gradual shift to the long-term capital gains tax regime proposed in the FY25 budget, which aims to eliminate indexation benefits for property, gold, and other unlisted assets.According to an ET report by Deepshikha Sikarwar, the industry is suggesting alternatives such as a higher tax rate with indexation or a lower rate of 12.5% without indexation, as well as some form of grandfathering for ancestral properties.The finance ministry is currently reviewing these proposals and will discuss them with the Prime Minister's Office. The final decision will be made closer to the date when the Finance Bill reply is to be presented in Parliament, the reports said.Industry groups are expected to submit formal proposals to the finance ministry in the near future. ""We are proposing that some time be given to taxpayers for transition,"" said an official with a leading industry lobby group.Also Read | New Budget 2024 rule: Why Income Tax Department is likely to issue a huge number of tax notices this month The finance ministry has already conducted one round of discussions regarding the concerns raised by various stakeholders about the move, including the potential increase in black money transactions.""Since the sudden transition to a new capital gains regime impacts existing properties held by taxpayers, the amendment has a retroactive impact for such taxpayers,"" said an official with another industry body supporting a transition regime.The proposed suggestions include giving the seller of a property the option of either a 20% LTCG rate with indexation or a 12.5% LTCG rate without that benefit.""As per tax policy diligently followed by the current government, any drastic change in regime has been made in a gradual manner, by providing options to taxpayers to choose between the old regime and new regime,"" said Sudhir Kapadia, senior advisor at EY, supporting the suggestion.Also Read | How Budget 2024 announcements will spur balanced growth of real estate sector He cited examples such as domestic companies having the choice between a concessional 22% tax rate under Section 115 BAA without incentives and deductions, or the normal 30% tax rate after claiming permitted tax incentives and deductions, as well as individual taxpayers having the choice between two separate tax regimes—one with deductions and the other without.

Budget 2024 for manufacturing sector : The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth. While the middle class has been offered tax relief, the government's primary focus remains on judicious spending to maximize economic impact. The budget's core themes are employment, skilling, MSME development, and support for the middle class.Largely focus has remained intact on spending money judiciously to ensure that each penny spent creates a ripple effect in the entire economic landscape.Although at first glance, manufacturing might appear to have taken a backseat, a deeper analysis reveals a multifaceted approach to bolstering the sector. Initiatives like employment-linked benefits and internship programs, while primarily aimed at job creation and skill development, indirectly benefit manufacturing companies by expanding the talent pool.Extensive focus on the MSME manufacturing units by way of extending term loan facility for purchase of machinery and equipment without collateral or third-party guarantee, would help companies in augmenting their capital base/ capacity and strengthen the very foundation of the manufacturing ecosystem in the country. Development of a new credit-assessment model by Public Sector Banks to assess MSME credit shall provide much needed regulatory relief to the units.With respect to the large manufacturing entities, while there is no direct fiscal/ tax incentive introduced in this budget, some support has been provided with an extensive focus on development of ‘industrial parks’ in nearly 100 cities under the ‘plug and play’ model. Reforms proposed with respect to land administration, planning and management, shall also ease out acquisition related difficulties often faced by entrepreneurs/ business houses in acquiring lands for manufacturing set-ups.Targeted Customs duty interventions like, rationalization of Customs duty provisions in Mobile phone manufacturing setups, extension of Customs duty exemption on import of capital goods for manufacturing of solar cells and panels, full Customs duty exemption on import of 25 critical minerals,, shall provide the required impetus for enhancing domestic manufacturing environment.Governments’ focus on formulating an Economic Policy Framework to set the scope for next-gen reforms in the country, has a target to improve the productivity of factors of production, namely, land, labour, capital, entrepreneurship and technology. This shall pave the way for enabling achievement of a target of 25% manufacturing sector contribution to the nation’s GDP over the course of next 7-10 years.While the overall outlook is positive, the extension of tax benefits under Section 115BAB for manufacturing entities and the absence of new PLI schemes are notable omissions.The country’s manufacturing base is expanding as is reflective from the continuously increasing tax collections and expanding Purchasing Manager’s Index. It would be pertinent to see how the ground realities evolve vis-à-vis the vision envisaged, in the upcoming Financial Year.","The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth.

Budget 2024: Armed with the vision to propel India to become a developed country by 2047, the Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business thereby providing the required stimulus to the manufacturing sector and enabling large scale job creation.On the Indirect tax front, the industry welcomes the much-needed announcement for a comprehensive review of the rate structure under Customs enabling ease in product classification and dispute reduction.The proposal of lowering of Customs duty on a plethora of raw materials and products including solar cells, critical minerals and bullion are encouraging measures. The rationale behind such reduction clearly indicates support towards domestic manufacturing, deepening value addition and supporting targets in reducing carbon footprint.Relevant amendments under the Customs law have been made to provide increased time limits for re-imports and re-exports to enhance competitiveness of the fledgling MRO sector. The government has extended significant duty reduction and exemption benefits to the healthcare and electronics sectors, continuing the impetus of incentives provided under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme.Since their introduction in March 2020, the PLI schemes have indeed supported in revitalizing the manufacturing sector and strengthening the necessary supply chains. The success achieved in the mobile manufacturing sector has now enabled the Government to reduce customs duties on mobile phones and components, signalling a mature environment. The Budget proposals aim at reproducing similar outcomes for semiconductor and pharmaceutical industry by increasing the budgetary allocation.Buoyed by the increasing revenue collection under GST signalling a shift towards a mature tax regime, this Budget has harmonized the timeframes for the issuance of demand notices and adjudication orders for cases involving fraud, suppression or otherwise. Significant amendments to the GST legislations have been introduced reflecting the recommendations proposed by the GST Council such as regularizing non-levy of GST due to general practice which may turn out to be a breather for certain impacted industries reeling under huge tax demands.The Insurance sector has been provided much relief through the GST council recommendations which have been cemented in the present budget thereby ending long standing disputes on their business practices.The Government's efforts to push forward with its reform agenda are evident as plans to incentivize states for their business reform actions plans and digitalization through the Jan Vishwas Bill 2.0 is proposed. Further, setting up of e-commerce export hubs is envisaged to facilitate easier access to international markets for domestic players.The recent implementation of Budget proposals allows the government to maintain momentum in its reform agenda. These policy measures implicitly reaffirm the significance of India Inc as a crucial element in the development of infrastructure. However, there are still some expectations required to be met to march towards a Viksit Bharat 2047.",The Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business.

How Budget 2024 announcements will spur balanced growth of real estate sector,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/how-budget-2024-announcements-will-spur-balanced-growth-of-real-estate-sector/articleshow/112211761.cms,"By Binaifer Jehani and Abbas Master

A look at the five key focus areas of this budget reveals the good augury.

Affordable housing

through

(PMAY)

Digitalisation and transparency: Stamp duty rationalisation and land-related reforms

Budget 2024 : Real estate, a significant contributor to employment generation, has received a fair bit of attention in Budget 2024-25. Recent years have seen the sector transform rapidly, driven by factors such as favourable government policies, Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, strong economic growth and changing consumer preferences.Added to that, the budgetary focus on job creation, skilling and employment-linked incentives, infrastructure, urban development, rural connectivity, digitalisation and land-related norms, all dovetail to promote growth of the sector.Launched in June 2015, the PMAY aims to provide affordable housing to all eligible beneficiaries. The budget unveiled PMAY Urban 2.0, under which the housing needs of 1 crore urban poor and middle class will be addressed with an investment of Rs 10 lakh crore.The central government’s additional Rs 2.2 lakh crore injection in the next 5 years to make housing more affordable has the potential to revitalise the affordable housing market.Such an approach can play an important role in realising the government's vision of Housing for All and push growth and development. Hence, the significant investment under PMAY Urban 2.0 is expected to alleviate urban housing deficits, spurring construction and economic growth.Steps to introduce technological reforms within the regulatory framework for land, such as digitalisation or GIS mapping of land records, will improve transparency.Rationalisation of stamp duty across states will also be critical to bring in uniformity and initiate land-related reforms such as urban planning, usage and building bylaws.These are steps in the right direction and will boost growth. Moreover, they will improve the ease of property transactions and strengthen municipal finances through increased property taxes. Rationalization of stamp duty with an emphasis on women homebuyers may boost home-buyer sentiment in major cities, too.The budget has also given ample attention to urban and rural development, with rental housing for industrial workers through the public private partnership model, interest subsidies for rental housing, and transit-oriented developments.The proposal to develop investment-ready plug-and-play industrial parks in 100 cities may attract industrial investment, leading to increased demand for industrial real estate and support the growth of ancillary services and residential developments in these regions.Initiatives for industrial parks and rental housing for industrial workers align with the country’s manufacturing goals and addresses worker accommodation needs.These steps are expected to promote industrial growth and stability in labour-intensive sectors, while also creating new opportunities for real estate developers specialising in rental and affordable housing.The changes in long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax, however, have evoked a mixed reaction. The government lowered the long-term capital gains tax from 20% to 12.5%, which is a welcome step. However, this came with the removal of the indexation benefit.The changes could encourage more liquidity in property transactions and potentially increase the effective tax burden depending on the property’s acquisition date.The launch of Phase IV of the PM Gram Sadak Yojana in 25,000 rural habitations will improve connectivity in rural areas, promoting rural development and making these regions more accessible for investment. The primary objective of PMGSY is to build robust, all-weather roads in rural habitations. This initiative focuses on enhancing connectivity and supporting economic development in rural areas.In essence, the budget is geared towards stimulating growth and investment in the real estate sector , fostering a more transparent and investor-friendly environment, and contributing to overall development. It aims to create a balanced and inclusive growth environment by addressing the needs of various segments, including affordable housing, industrial workers and urban infrastructure.The effectiveness of the initiatives, however, hinges on their implementation and continued support of complementary reforms.","Budget 2024-25 is geared towards stimulating growth and investment in the real estate sector.

New Budget 2024 rule: Why Income Tax Department is likely to issue a huge number of tax notices this month,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-budget-2024-rule-why-income-tax-department-is-likely-to-issue-a-huge-number-of-tax-notices-this-month/articleshow/112186079.cms,"Taxing Times

Income Tax Notice on the way? The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month, as there are concerns that many taxpayers might escape the tax net due to the impending implementation of the new reassessment law on September 1, 2024.According to the amended regulation announced in Budget 2024 , the tax authorities can only go back a maximum of five years to reassess a taxpayer's records if the escaped income is at least Rs 50 lakh, and three years for an amount less than Rs 50 lakh.Previously, they could reassess cases up to 10 years old.According to an ET report, tax officials are now faced with the challenge of compiling and corroborating data on tax and income mismatches for the financial years 2013-14 to 2017-18 within the next few weeks, as these years will become time-barred for reassessment from September 1, 2024.The I-T department relies on information from various sources, such as banks, property registrars, and search findings from the investigation wing, to build reassessment cases.A tax officers' body has raised concerns about the feasibility of issuing notices under Section 148 (or 148A) in a large number of cases within a single month, given the overburdened nature of the jurisdictional assessing officers and the time-consuming process of obtaining sanction from the chief commissioner, who is the specified authority for such notices.Moreover, the law provides taxpayers with the right to explain their position before reassessment orders are finalized, a process that most believe cannot be completed by the end of August.Also Read | ITR refund status for FY 2023-24: How to check income tax refund status online - here’s a step-by-step guide for incometax.gov.in & NSDL websites The Central Board of Direct Taxes ( CBDT ) has been urged by its officers to postpone the effective date of the proposed amendment. However, this suggestion is unlikely to be well-received by corporations and high net worth individuals.""Capping the reassessment period at five years was a great decision as it would reduce hassles and litigation. But if the department fears there could be a genuine loss of revenue as it may not be possible to wrap up several matters by August 31, the government can think of strict parameters where time-bound cases can be selectively reopened - based on trails of steps taken in identifying escaped income,"" said Mitil Chokshi, partner at CA firm Chokshi & Chokshi.""Taxpayers may expect a rush of reassessment notices in August 2024. These notices are likely to be for the AYs 2018-19 and prior to that. It is pertinent to note that the Bombay High Court in a recent ruling in a case of Hexaware Technologies has taken a view on a proviso introduced in 2021, which can be interpreted to mean that AY 2017-18 (and prior years) got time barred on March 31, 2024. These reassessment notices (for AYs 2017-18 and prior) are likely to rake up new interpretation issues in the already muddled reassessment provisions,"" said Ashish Mehta, partner at law firm Khaitan & Co.The current situation is similar to the conflict between the Income Tax office and taxpayers in 2021. The reassessment law was amended in April 2021, allowing the tax office to reopen 10-year-old tax returns if the total undisclosed income exceeded Rs 50 lakh and reassess 4-year-old matters if the amount was less than Rs 50 lakh.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? However, this change led to over 10,000 writ petitions being filed by companies, arguing that they were not given sufficient time to explain and that the notices were issued without considering the carve-out that cases which couldn't be reopened earlier couldn't be reassessed under the new law.The Supreme Court invoked its extraordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution on May 4, 2022, to uphold all reassessment notices issued after March 31, 2021. However, the court left room for judicial proceedings based on the merits of each case, and several such matters are currently pending before the court.","The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month.

In 2004, the capex allocation of UPA’s first Budget was Rs 90,000 crore. This increased to only Rs 2 lakh crore in the last UPA budget in 2014, Modi said. At present the capex allocation is over Rs 11 lakh crore, Modi added. Modi pointed out that the capex allocation of railways and highways has become 8 times under his government.

He also noted the time when India had been ranked among the ‘Fragile Five’ economies in the world.

He also said that India's fiscal prudence has become an example for the world to see.Modi spoke of the government's initiatives to transform the manufacturing sector of the economy with steps like 'Make in India', Production Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes, liberalisation of FDI norms, setting up of multi-modal logistics hubs.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman presented the first Union Budget of the newly elected NDA government on July 23, 2024.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that in 10 years, his government has tripled India’s Budget.

Are NPS Vatsalya & hiked NPS deduction limit for private sector employees good moves from Budget 2024?

NPS and EPF: Overlapping services

What is NPS Vatsalaya?

Latest NPS rules, news: In the Union Budget 2024 speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced two new initiatives with regard to National Pension Scheme (NPS) - extension of NPS 14% employer contribution benefits to private setcor and the intended launch of NPS Vatsalya.Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries, bringing it at par with the provisions available for government employees.Sriram Iyer, CEO, HDFC Pension Management told ET that with this move the “ground rules have been harmonised among government and non-government employees, which is a positive step.”Effectively, this means that now, private-sector employees can choose to reduce the taxable portion of employers’ contribution to their NPS corpus, thereby paying less tax and leaving greater funds in their pension deposits.“Employees will benefit from tax savings . More importantly, the 40% increase in contribution will have a significant impact on the terminal value of the retirement corpus,” remarked Iyer. The extended savings will “help in retirement planning, working as an option that is at par with the Provident Fund,” Dinesh Rohira, CEO & Founder, 5nance.com was quoted as saying.Moreover, the endeavour aims to increase NPS penetration by increasing tax incentives for the private sector, providing them a social security-cushion post-retirement.The scheme’s motive to widen the NPS subscriber base may not prove to be flawlessly effective, however. This is explained by Agrees Mrin Agarwal, Founder, Finsafe India: “While it’s good that the limit has been raised, it may not increase adoption as employees need to be educated in a big way. Also, the benefit is only for the salaried opting for the new tax regime,” she says.The mandatory contribution to the EPF, too, threatens to relegate the provisions of NPS under the umbrella of near-superfluity. This sentiment is echoed by Varun Sahay, a software engineer in a Delhi-based IT company: “When 12% of my salary is already deducted for the EPF, why should I put in more in the NPS and cut my take-home pay?”Rohira feels otherwise. “There’s no competition between the NPS and EPF as employees can contribute to both and build a 3-4 times bigger corpus while earning 3-4% higher returns via marketlinked options in the NPS,” he counters.Also Check | New Tax Regime 2023 vs 2024 After Budget: How Much Income Tax Will Salaried Taxpayers Save & How Do New Tax Slabs Compare To Old Regime? Top 10 Points You Must Know To jumpstart retirement savings for children, a new initiative called NPS Vatsalya has been unveiled in the Budget. This scheme allows parents and guardians to contribute to a minor's account, which can be converted into a regular NPS account once the child reaches adulthood.""It provides a very long duration for reaping the compounding benefits and accumulating a huge bounty at a later age. This can be a good way to plan a better future for kids who may not opt for a service segment in the future,"" says Rohira. Sriram Iyer agrees, stating, ""It’s a good move to help the child start his retirement journey. Even if a parent starts when the child is 10 years old, by the time he starts working, it can be a solid foundation for the compounding journey after that.""However, some experts question the utility of a product with such a long lock-in period, especially when parents cannot use the funds for essential goals like their child’s education amidst soaring education costs of 11-12%.""Parents are struggling to save for their own retirement, so it might be a bit of a stretch to expect them to save for their kids’ retirement. The need of the hour is a market-linked product that allows withdrawals only for the child’s education,"" says Mrin Agarwal, Founder of Finsafe India.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? Though the NPS permits partial withdrawals, it allows only 25% of the corpus after three years of joining, and this can be done only three times during the entire tenure. A premature exit before 60 years with 100% withdrawal is only possible if the corpus is less than Rs.2.5 lakh, an amount insufficient for most children's goals.""In its current form, there won’t be any uptake,"" asserts Agarwal. Rohira concurs, ""It’s a vanilla product with a lock-in, which does not make it very attractive and it may not take off. However, the government may optimise it and introduce new features later."" Iyer adds, ""This is just a start and there may be more subscriber-friendly features as we take it to the market. The regulator is proactive and open to feedback.""","Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries.

Gold import duty cut: Why Indians may not find buying gold from Dubai as attractive post Budget 2024,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-import-duty-cut-why-indians-may-not-find-buying-gold-from-dubai-as-attractive-post-budget-2024/articleshow/112097671.cms,"Gold import duty cut in Budget 2024: The recent reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai. Indian jewellers with stores in both India and the UAE believe that the narrowed duty differential will result in lower gold prices in India, making it less attractive for Indians to purchase gold in Dubai.The emirate had attracted gold-enthusiast Indians following a steep rise in customs duty in India in July 2022. In the fiscal 2024-25 budget, the duty on gold imports was more than halved.The duty cut is also expected to boost gold jewellery production in India, particularly the popular 'Kolkatti' jewellery from Kolkata, which is favored by Indian expats in Dubai and tourists from various countries. This move will encourage gold artisans to create new designs in both heavyweight and lightweight jewellery, attracting consumers to purchase gold from India.According to an ET report, Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group , estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India as Indian tourists who previously bought jewellery in Dubai will now prefer to shop in India. However, Indian expats living in Dubai and other customers may continue to buy from the UAE.Also Read | Gold losing sheen?

He points out that the labour cost is significantly lower in India, and with the introduction of mandatory hallmarking and HUID numbers, the purity of gold in India is no longer a concern.Furthermore, NRIs in Dubai do not receive VAT refunds, and Indians travelling abroad only receive about 60% of the VAT back on their gold purchases. Gold trade analyst Bhargav Baidya suggests that the 1% duty differential between gold jewellery in India and Dubai will be offset by Indian jewellers offering discounts to retain and attract customers.Saurabh Gadgil, chairman of PNG Jewellers, notes that Indian import duty is now on par with the US, allowing Indian jewellers to offer competitive prices compared to other countries worldwide. The reduced customs duty is expected to make gold purchases in India more attractive and convenient for Indian consumers, potentially leading to a significant shift in their gold shopping preferences.",The reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai.

Gold losing sheen? The government has reduced its target for issuing gold bonds in the financial year 2024-25 by 38% compared to the previous interim budget goal, according to a senior official. The revised target stands at Rs 18,500 crore, down from Rs 29,638 crore estimated in the interim budget and Rs 26,852 crore (revised estimate) in 2023-24.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told ET ""The decision followed a reassessment of various factors, including investor demand, other investment products and uncertainties around the global economy, as the situation has changed since the interim budget in February.""After accounting for redemptions, the net issuances of sovereign gold bonds are now estimated at Rs 15,000 crore for this fiscal year, a significant decrease from the Rs 26,138 crore projected in the interim budget and Rs 25,352 crore in the revised estimate for 2023-24.Harish Galipelli, director at ILA Commodities India, attributed this shift to retail investors increasingly opting for equities in anticipation of better returns. He also noted that people are uncertain about the potential for further increases in gold prices in the short-to-medium term following a recent rally. Additionally, Galipelli pointed out that savings in rural areas have been impacted by retail inflation and other factors.The gold bond and gold monetisation schemes were introduced by the government in late 2015 to discourage the physical purchase of precious metals and reduce imports, thereby mitigating the negative impact on the current account deficit.The gross collection through these two schemes is now projected to be Rs 20,030 crore in 2024-25, compared to Rs 31,168 crore in the interim budget and Rs 28,240 crore (revised estimate) in the previous fiscal year. Similarly, the net collection is estimated at Rs 16,433 crore, down from Rs 27,571 crore in the interim budget and Rs 26,653 crore in the previous year.

Both schemes were designed to curb gold imports, which, along with crude oil, have been significant contributors to India's current account deficit.

NEW DELHI: Shooters from Uttar Pradesh's Azamgarh and the Trans-Yamuna region allegedly bumped off Dubai-based entrepreneur Nadir Shah in south Delhi's Greater Kailash I on Thursday night, a probe has revealed. Delhi Police 's Special Cell has managed to detain around seven suspects — four of whom have been placed under arrest — for the brazen killing that TOI reported on Friday.Two of the main shooters, captured on CCTV, have been identified as Madhur and Raju but are on the run.As of now, gangsters Lawrence Bishnoi , Rohit Godara and Hashim Baba are being considered the masterminds of the shootout. While several motives are being floated, investigators believe it was a ‘symbolic killing' aimed at sending a strong signal to big businessmen in both Dubai and India.There were several reasons why Shah was a target. He was a friend of south Delhi gangster Rohit Chaudhary and another entity codenamed K. ""This irked Bishnoi, who was apparently informed that Shah had a multi-crore rupee transaction with K,"" said a source. ""The Bishnoi group was also being tipped on how Shah used his contacts to target Baba's men. So, they decided to send a message.""A land shark, codenamed AJ, from south Delhi but now settled in Dubai and another criminal from northeast Delhi named Sabir are also under the scanner for involvement in the conspiracy.The Azamgarh module — comprising Akash, Prince and Vishal — arrived in the city on Thursday and stayed in Jamia Nagar. Baba's men allegedly provided them logistical support and weapons. Some other men like Naveen from Sonipat also joined them. They reached the gym in GKI in an autorickshaw and a two-wheeler. They zeroed in on the target who was standing outside the gym, and Madhur pulled the trigger around 10.45pm, said a police officer. The assailants fired 15 rounds, nine of which hit Shah. They then fled, some going to Seelampur and the others elsewhere. Akash, Prince, Vishal and Naveen were arrested with a copy of a US-made Ruger pistol and dozens of bullets early on Friday.Around midnight, a Facebook account in the name of Rohit Godara claimed responsibility for the murder. ""Our brother Samir Baba, lodged in Tihar Jail, had sent a message that Nadir was creating obstacles in our business and was friends with our enemies, so we got him killed. Whoever helps our enemies will meet the same fate,"" the post from a day-old account stated. Godara is the man Friday of Bishnoi and Goldy Brar and has been behind many killings across the country, including that of Karni Sena chief Sukhdev Gogamedi. The post is cryptic, an investigator said, because it doesn't mention Bishnoi, which is usually the case after such killings but mentions instead the names of associates like Gogi Maan and Kala Rana. Godara likely funded the shooters, the cops say.Sources said that the killing has a strong connection with the Trans-Yamuna region and the Baba, the area's most dreaded gangster, has emerged as a key character in the plot. His rivalry with incarcerated south Delhi gangster Rohit Chaudhary is being probed. ""Baba was irked as Shah and Chaudhary were not letting his men operate in south Delhi areas like Aya Nagar, etc., using their contacts. Nadir was also an informer for some cops and used the connection to tip off police about the Baba gang's activities,"" said a source. Samir, mentioned in the Facebook post, is also a gangster who operates in northeast Delhi on Baba's instructions but is currently in jail after the Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital shooting in July.Baba's alliance with Bishnoi has been in police knowledge for over three years. ""Bishnoi had initially tasked Baba to assassinate Siddhu Moose Wala. Baba's aide, Shahrukh, had conducted a reconnaissance of the slain singer's movements. Shahrukh even reached Mansa in Punjab with weapons, but was unable to carry out the killing,"" informed a source. Baba, who is in Mandoli jail and faces charges under MCOCA, has over two dozen cases registered against him, including for murder, extortion, attempted murder and violation of the Arms Act.","Gangsters Lawrence Bishnoi, Rohit Godara and Hashim Baba are being considered the masterminds of the shootout. Two of the main shooters, captured on CCTV, have been identified as Madhur and Raju but are on the run. Shah was a friend of south Delhi gangster Rohit Chaudhary.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113339686,imgsize-3581031,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/113339686.jpg"

In terms of special cargo, we continually review the market, and we'll look to build facilities within the cargo to monitor the system,"" he said.About the company's expansion in India, Watts said Cathay Cargo has no immediate plans to operate cargo terminals around the world.""...I think all I would say is, never say, never. If an opportunity presents itself in India or anywhere in the world where there might be an investment for Cathay Cargo Terminal. Of course, we'd have to, we'd look at that,"" he said.""We certainly welcome all Indian airlines to come and use our facilities when they're flying in and out of Hong Kong. And we're talking to a carrier at the moment. Talks are underway, so I can't say too much about that, but I very much hope that comes to fruition"".Tom Owen, Director Cargo told PTI in an interaction that Cathay Cargo has enough capacity to play an important role in India's push for manufacturing and exports.""Our strength is connecting India to the world, and that's what India needs. It needs more capacity to connect to the world,"" Owen said.Watts said that Cathay Cargo aims to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and is working on various plans to reduce CO2 emissions.""The big target for us is to try and be absolute net zero carbon emissions by 2050. We got a target to cut our carbon emission by 50 per cent by 2035,"" he said.The company has turned all the vehicles that are used inside the terminal into electric.""In terms of the tractors that move between the terminals and aeroplanes... we are looking on how to decarbonise those and working sort of how we can replace them with sustainable fuel. Ultimately, we want to electrify that as well,"" he said, adding that the company is also working with the Hong Kong Airport Authority on autonomous electric tractors.Besides, the company has also started recycling plastic sheets that are used to cover various shipments.""All those plastics get compressed and picked up by recycling suppliers. They turn them into resin pellets, and that same plastic comes back to us in a new cover sheet. We are also looking at whether we should be using biodegradable plastics, and still something we continue to look at,"" he said.According to Watts, the company has done a lot of experimentation with different types of plastic mixed in different climate conditions.""...So monsoon in India, snowstorms in Anchorage (US), very hot weather down in Australia. I think we did some trials in hot weather to make sure what was the optimum amount of or what was the highest recycled plastic we could use while still ensuring that the plastic was waterproof,"" he said.About the use of artificial intelligence, Watts said Cathay Cargo is working on using an AI-enabled system to ensure the safety of workers at the cargo terminals and enhance operational efficiency.""AI has got a number of huge applications that, again, will make our services more efficient, be better for our customers, but equally, be better for our people, because it really will help them do their job better, keep them safer and make their jobs more interesting,"" Watts said.","Cathay Cargo, part of Cathay Pacific Airways, has said it wants Indian airlines to use its Hong Kong-based cargo terminal.

Majority of US voters support Trump's tariff plans for Chinese imports: Survey,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/majority-of-us-voters-support-trumps-tariff-plans-for-chinese-imports-survey/articleshow/113369193.cms,"A recent Reuters/Ipsos poll reveals that majority of US voters support Donald Trump's pledge to raise tariffs on imported goods, especially those from China, highlighting his economic edge over his competitor, Vice President Kamala Harris The September 11-12 poll indicated that 56% of registered voters were more inclined to back a candidate who supports a new 10% tariff on all imports and a 60% tariff on imports from China, while 41% were less likely to support such a candidate.Both the Republican former president and his Democratic rival have pledged to implement tax cuts if they secure victory in the November 5 election. However, voters also perceive Trump as more likely to reduce the $35 trillion national debt , despite independent economic analysts predicting that his plans would have the contrary effect.The poll also revealed that one-third of Democrats were more likely to support a candidate who favors higher tariffs and steep levies on Chinese goods, while two-thirds were less likely to do so. Independent voters reflected the broader electorate.Polling expert Karlyn Bowman from the conservative American Enterprise Institute attributes Trump's advantage to the perception that the economy performed well during his 2017-2021 administration and his success in persuading voters that US economic issues stemmed from unfair economic competition from other nations, particularly China.Although Harris holds a 5-percentage-point lead over Trump nationally, the US presidential race will be largely determined in approximately seven battleground states where the contest is more competitive.The US economy performed well by many indicators During the Trump administration, until the COVID-19 pandemic devastated the global economy in 2020. Unemployment reached its lowest levels in decades, although the national debt was increasing and would surge during the pandemic.This year, Trump has pledged various tax cuts on the campaign trail, including eliminating income tax on tipped income, a proposal that Harris also supports. On Thursday, he promised to end taxes on overtime pay, with 70% of registered voters supporting the idea of exempting tips from taxes.During his presidency, Donald Trump referred to himself as a ""tariff man"" as he imposed tariffs on imports from China. However, economists, including those at Goldman Sachs, are skeptical of this approach, believing that Trump's policies would hinder economic growth.In the recent presidential debate, Kamala Harris cited Goldman Sachs' evaluation and pointed out that many independent economists think Trump's plans would increase the national debt. Despite this, the poll revealed that 37% of US voters believe Trump is more likely to prioritize debt reduction, while only 30% chose Harris. The remaining 30% believed neither candidate would address the issue.Several respected budget analysts project that Trump's tax proposals would add a minimum of $3 trillion to federal deficits over the next ten years. In contrast, the same analysts predict that Harris' plans would add less than $2 trillion or potentially even reduce the debt. When asked which candidate would prioritize creating a favorable business climate, 47% of polled voters selected Trump, compared to 37% who chose Harris.However, Harris held a slight 1-percentage-point lead (43% to 42%) when voters were asked which candidate would focus on creating ""an economic climate that is good for me and my family."" Voters also believed that Harris was more likely to prioritize making healthcare affordable and investing in infrastructure.Trump had an advantage regarding inflation, which experienced significant increases under Biden's administration in 2021 and 2022. The poll showed that 43% of voters believed Trump would be more likely to ""lower prices for everyday things like groceries and gas,"" while 36% chose Harris.The Reuters/Ipsos poll, which has a margin of error of approximately 3 percentage points, collected online responses from 1,405 registered voters.","A recent Reuters/Ipsos poll reveals that majority of US voters support Donald Trump's pledge to raise tariffs on imported goods, especially those from China.

Amazon and Flipkart have not commented on reports' findings .Both reports said that during probe, Amazon & Flipkart ""deliberately downplayed"" allegations of exclusive launches, but officials found the practice was ""rampant"".South Korea's Samsung and China's Xiaomi are two of India's biggest smartphone players, together holding an almost 36% market share. India's e-retail market is set to exceed USD 160 billion by 2028, up from USD 57-60 billion in 2023, consultancy firm Bain estimates.Amazon and Flipkart have long faced the ire of small retailers in India for hurting their offline businesses. CCI reports said both companies used their foreign investments to provide subsidised rates for services like warehousing and marketing to a select number of sellers.Probe into Amazon, Flipkart and their sellers was triggered in 2020 by a complaint from an affiliate of Confederation of All India Traders, which has 8 crore members.CCI will in coming weeks review any objections to its findings from Amazon, Flipkart, the retailer association, and the smartphone companies, and could potentially impose fines along with mandating companies to change their business practices, people familiar with the matter said.Indian retailers have repeatedly accused Amazon and Flipkart, and smartphone companies, of exclusive phone launches online, saying shopkeepers suffered as they didn't get the latest models and customers looked for them on shopping websites.","Antitrust investigations conducted by Competition Commission of India found Amazon and Flipkart violated local competition laws.

The market is witnessing significant developments across top crypto projects like VISTA , Neiro , and BlockDAG .VISTA’s token price skyrocketed 40x after EtherVista ’s launch, driven by its no-code launchpad and a solution to mitigate rug pulls. Neiro, meanwhile, jumped 60% due to a potential short squeeze.Yet, the biggest spotlight is on BlockDAG . Following a highly anticipated AMA with CEO Antony Turner, BlockDAG’s presale crossed $72.4 million, with miner sales alone contributing $5 million.VISTA, the native token of the decentralized exchange EtherVista, has surged 40x since its launch on August 31st. EtherVista’s unique no-code launchpad aims to curb the problem of rug-pulls that has plagued many memecoin projects. Developers can assign fees directly to smart contracts, ensuring more transparent and secure transactions.Unlike traditional percentage-based swap taxes, VISTA’s fees are pegged to USDC, giving traders a more predictable experience. With a capped supply of just 1 million tokens and a built-in burn mechanism, VISTA is positioned to combat inflation and maintain long-term value.$NEIRO, an Ethereum-based meme coin, recently surged over 60%, hitting a high of $0.085 before settling at $0.0768—still a solid 41% gain. This reversal came after a month of bearish trading, as traders stepped in at the $0.0220 support level, driving trading volume from $15 million to nearly $60 million.Although $NEIRO’s fundamentals have not shifted, analysts suggest that a short squeeze could push the price even higher. With millions in short positions on the token, a climb to the $0.113 resistance level remains possible.Over the past few months, BlockDAG has achieved significant milestones in the crypto space. Its presale has already raised over $72.4 million in just a few months, making it the fastest-growing presale in crypto history. Moreover, the BDAG coin has delivered early holders an ROI of over 1,680% and secured two of the largest soccer sponsorship deals in the history of cryptocurrency. Speculation about BDAG reaching $1 per coin by 2025, and delivering a 30,000x ROI in the coming years, has kept miners and holders excited as the project continues to expand rapidly.The latest excitement comes from BlockDAG’s recent AMA, where CEO Antony Turner shed light on the network’s mining ecosystem. Turner highlighted the advantages of the X Series Miners—X10, X30, and X100. These mining rigs are designed for power and performance, with the X10 delivering 100 MH/s on just 40 watts, while the X100 offers 2 TH/s at 1800 watts.These rigs strike the perfect balance between efficiency and performance, making them highly appealing to miners looking to maximize output while keeping operational costs in check.The impact of this AMA has been significant, leading to the sale of over 11,935 miners and generating almost $5 million in revenue. This has solidified BlockDAG’s position as a top choice for miners and holders.Currently, BDAG is priced at $0.0178 in presale batch 22. With a robust $1 price forecast, those who start minting BDAG coins now could see substantial gains when the forecast is met.While the VISTA token’s 40x price surge and Neiro’s 60% spike have certainly grabbed attention, BlockDAG’s consistent growth and sustainable approach have set it apart.The recent AMA not only highlighted the potential of the X Series Miners but also triggered massive sales and substantiated the claims of crypto experts who are predicting this presale to give 30,000x ROI for early investors.With BlockDAG’s $72.4 million presale milestone already achieved and its miner ecosystem expanding rapidly, all eyes are on the project as it heads toward its next goal: reaching a $1 price per $BDAG coin by early 2025. At the current price of $0.0178, those who start mining BDAG now could secure a significant passive income in the coming months.Presale: https://purchase.blockdag.network Website: https://blockdag.network Telegram: https://t.me/blockDAGnetwork Discord: https://discord.gg/Q7BxghMVyu","VISTA, the native token of the decentralized exchange EtherVista, has surged 40x since its launch on August 31st.

Boeing faces potential strike as workers reject contract in landslide vote,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/boeing-faces-potential-strike-as-workers-reject-contract-in-landslide-vote/articleshow/113324582.cms,"Boeing factory workers in the United States voted on Thursday to go on strike, rejecting a contract offer from the aviation company.The workers, who are represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 751, expressed dissatisfaction with the proposed deal. The vote to reject the contract was 94.6 percent, and the vote to strike was 96 percent, according to union president Jon Holden.The strike will affect two major plane assembly plants in the Puget Sound region and involve about 33,000 workers.Holden said, ""Our members spoke loud and clear tonight. We strike at midnight.""Boeing indicated its willingness to resume negotiations despite the vote outcome. The company said in a statement, ""We remain committed to resetting our relationship with our employees and the union, and we are ready to get back to the table to reach a new agreement.""Under the leadership of new CEO Kelly Ortberg, Boeing had offered a 25-percent wage increase over four years and a commitment to invest in the Puget Sound area. However, workers were dissatisfied, stating that the wage hike was not as generous as portrayed, and the proposed agreement eliminated an annual bonus.The workers had sought a 40 percent wage increase. Critics argued that the proposed 25 percent increase was misleading because it did not account for the loss of the annual bonus. Other issues included the absence of a restored pension and a perceived lack of firm commitments on future projects in the Seattle region.Paul Janousek, an electrician in Everett, highlighted the dissatisfaction, saying, ""They're talking about a 25 percent increase and it's not."" He estimated his raise at only about nine percent after the removal of the annual bonus.Some workers also expressed frustration over the compensation received by former CEOs Dennis Muilenburg and Dave Calhoun during challenging times for the company. Joe Philbin, a structural mechanic, noted the long-term benefits of striking. ""Striking isn't ideal, but it's for the best for your long-term well-being,"" he said.The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers has a history of strikes, with the most recent one occurring in 2008. Holden initially supported the deal as the best achievable without a strike but acknowledged the power of the union members in making the final decision.Richard Aboulafia, managing director of AeroDynamic Advisory, suggested that a lengthy strike could impact Boeing's recovery efforts. Nonetheless, a recent strike at Boeing supplier Spirit AeroSystems lasted less than two weeks.Boeing has faced scrutiny following a January incident involving a Boeing 737 MAX plane. Holden expressed hope for renewed negotiations, stating that the vote ""sends a strong message that our members deserve better.""","Boeing factory workers in the United States voted on Thursday to go on strike. The vote to reject the contract was 94.6 percent, and the vote to strike was 96 percent. The strike will affect two major plane assembly plants in the Puget Sound region and involve about 33,000 workers.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113324804,imgsize-1132715,width-400,resizemode-4/113324804.jpg"
