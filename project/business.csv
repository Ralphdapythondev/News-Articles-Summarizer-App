Why did RBI bring 100 tonnes of gold reserves back to India? RBI governor Shaktikanta Das explains,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-did-rbi-bring-100-tonnes-of-gold-reserves-back-to-india-rbi-governor-shaktikanta-das-explains/articleshow/110867282.cms,"Why did RBI move 100 tonnes of India’s gold reserves back into the country? TOI was the first to report about the central bank’s decision to bring back such big amount of gold back into India from the UK.Shaktikanta Das , the governor of the Reserve Bank of India, has now explained the rationale behind the decision to bring 100 tonnes of gold back to the country. He has said that the amount of gold held outside India had increased due to RBI's purchases, and since there was available storage capacity within the country, a portion of the gold was decided to be stored domestically.Das said that the quantity of gold held by RBI had remained unchanged for an extended period. However, as RBI continued to purchase gold as part of its reserves management strategy, the amount of gold stored outside the country kept increasing. Given the domestic storage capacity, it was deemed appropriate to store a portion of the gold within India.Also See | Top 10 Countries With Highest Foreign Exchange Reserves Including Gold: Where do India, China, US stand? Check list “The quantum of gold held by RBI was static for a long time. As data shows, RBI was buying gold as part of its reserves management, and the quantum of gold held outside was going up. We have domestic capacity, and we felt part of the gold should be stored within the country. There is nothing more to it,” Das said.When asked about the Rangarajan committee's recommendation from 1993, which suggested that at least 25% of the gold reserves should be held overseas, Das pointed out that significant changes have occurred since then. He mentioned that a high-level committee is currently responsible for managing such matters.Das expressed astonishment that only one media outlet had reported on the relocation of 100 tonnes of gold from the UK to RBI's vaults in India, which was first reported by TOI on May 31, 2024. Now, approximately half of the gold is stored in vaults within the country.In an unprecedented move since early 1991, RBI has added a substantial quantity of precious metal to its domestic stock. Sources had told TOI that a similar amount of gold may be transferred to locations within the country in the coming months for logistical reasons and diversified storage.Also See | Top 10 Countries Receiving Highest Remittances: India tops list with new world record! Where do Pakistan, China stand? Check list RBI's latest data shows that as of March-end, it held 822.1 tonnes of gold, with 413.8 tonnes stored overseas. The central bank has been among those that have purchased gold in recent years, adding 27.5 tonnes during the last financial year. Traditionally, the Bank of England has been the storehouse for many central banks, including India, with some of the yellow metal stocks dating back to pre-Independence days.The transfer of 100 tonnes of gold, nearly a fourth of the country's stock at the end of March, was a complex logistical undertaking that required months of meticulous planning and execution. It involved close coordination between various government entities, including the finance ministry, RBI, and local authorities, the TOI report said.To facilitate the shipment, the Centre granted RBI a customs duty exemption, foregoing revenue on this sovereign asset. However, integrated GST, which is shared with the states, was still levied on the imports.A special aircraft was used to transport the large quantities of gold, with extensive security arrangements in place. The move is expected to help RBI save on some of the storage costs paid to the Bank of England, although the amount is not significant.Within India, gold is stored in vaults located in RBI's old office building on Mint Road in Mumbai and in Nagpur.","Shaktikanta Das, the governor of the Reserve Bank of India, has explained the rationale behind the decision to bring 100 tonnes of gold back to the country.

Railway stocks : Ashwini Vaishnaw 's continuation as the Railway Minister in the Modi 3.0 government is expected to bring renewed attention to stocks in the railway sector, many of which have delivered impressive returns over the past year.An analysis of the performance of railway sector stocks during the tenures of the four railway ministers in the previous two governments - D.V. Sadananda Gowda, Suresh Prabhu, Piyush Goyal, and Ashwini Vaishnaw - has been done by ETMarkets.Of these, Gowda had the shortest tenure, serving from May 26, 2014, to November 9, 2014, as the first minister to take charge of this important ministry. Suresh Prabhu followed, with a tenure lasting from November 9, 2014, to September 3, 2017. Piyush Goyal then held the office from September 4, 2017, to July 7, 2021, and Vaishnaw has been at the helm since July 7, 2021.During Vaishnaw's tenure, several state-run railway companies, including IRCTC, IRFC, Ircon, RVNL, Railtel, and RITES, were listed on the stock exchanges.The strong performance of railway stocks can be attributed to the government's renewed focus on the sector, resulting in growing order books and improved earnings.Titagarh Rail, a privately owned company, has been the top performer, delivering over 1,800% returns since Vaishnaw took over. The company has consistently reported quarter-on-quarter growth in its net profit, with a standalone PAT of Rs 79 crore in Q4FY24, up 64% year-on-year. Jupiter Wagons, another star performer, reported a 153% YoY increase in PAT, reaching Rs 104 crore in the January-March quarter.Among the PSU railway stocks, RVNL has gained 1066%, backed by solid performance. The company's net profit rose 26% YoY, from Rs 345 crore in Q4FY23 to Rs 433 crore in Q4FY24.IRFC has also seen a multibagger rally of 627%, supported by strong YoY and QoQ earnings growth. Its PAT increased by 33% to Rs 1,717 crore in Q4FY24, up from Rs 1,285 crore in Q4FY23.Vinit Bolinjkar, an analyst at Ventura Securities, believes that the power and railway sectors could remain in prime focus due to the huge demand and recommends investors maintain long positions in these sectors.Also Read | ‘Vande Bharat Bullet Train’ soon?

Home Loan Tips: The Reserve Bank of India's decision to maintain policy rates at their current levels has left home loan customers feeling disappointed. As a result, it is unlikely that home loan rates will decrease in the near future. Due to the series of repo rate increases that occurred between May 2022 and March 2023, home loan EMIs have increased significantly, and loan tenures have been prolonged by several years.According to an ET report, experts recommend that borrowers keep their loan tenure as short as possible to minimize the interest burden. The longer the loan tenure, the higher the interest outgo due to the compounding effect. For example, a Rs 50 lakh loan at 9% interest for 10 years will result in a total interest payment of Rs 26 lakh. Extending the tenure to 15 years increases the interest outgo to Rs 41 lakh, and a 20-year loan will result in an interest outgo of Rs 58 lakh.A shorter loan tenure can be challenging for young homebuyers, as the higher EMIs may not fit into their budget. If you must opt for a longer tenure of 15-20 years, try to increase the EMI amount gradually as your income rises. Increasing the EMI by 5% every year can reduce the tenure of a 20-year loan by nearly eight years.Prepayment becomes easier when you anticipate your income to grow each year. It is crucial to remember that prepayment has a more significant impact when the loan is new, so try to increase the EMI as early as possible. Any extra cash, such as proceeds from a maturing investment, a gift, or an annual bonus, should also be used to prepay the loan.When considering a home loan, it's crucial to evaluate the insurance options offered by the lender. While it's wise to secure life insurance alongside a substantial loan to protect your dependents from unpaid debt, the policies sold by banks may have limitations. These policies are often linked to the loan and may not be transferable, meaning they will terminate if you switch lenders during the loan tenure. Therefore, it is advisable to buy separate term insurance, as the coverage will continue even if you prepay the loan or change your lender.Understanding the connection between the benchmark and loan rate is essential when selecting a home loan. Most home loans have floating rates tied to an external benchmark, such as the RBI repo rate, which has remained at 6.5% since June 2023. Lenders determine the reset period, which can be quarterly, half-yearly, or annually. Determine the frequency of the rate reset before taking a loan. Choose a loan that quickly reflects changes in the external benchmark rate.Also Check | Post Office Savings Schemes Calculator: SSY, KVP, NSC, MIS, PPF, SCSS - How Much Will You Earn? Be A Crorepati With This Tax-Free Option - Top Points If you have a working spouse, consider taking a joint home loan to maximize tax benefits. The government allows a deduction of up to Rs 2 lakh on the interest paid on a home loan. However, with rising home prices, the average loan amount has increased significantly in recent years. At a 9% interest rate, a Rs 50 lakh home loan for 20 years would result in an annual interest of approximately Rs 4.5 lakh.If your spouse earns as well, you can jointly claim up to Rs 4 lakh in deductions if both husband and wife take a joint home loan and each claims a Rs 2 lakh deduction individually. Additionally, some states offer lower stamp duty rates if the property is registered in a woman's name. For example, in Delhi, the stamp duty is 6% for male buyers, while female buyers pay only 4%.","The Reserve Bank of India's decision to maintain policy rates at their current levels has left home loan customers feeling disappointed.

Hyundai Motor 's Indian unit is gearing up to file a draft red herring prospectus ( DRHP ) with the Securities and Exchange Board of India ( Sebi ) within the next two weeks. This move marks the beginning of their journey toward an initial public offering ( IPO ), according to sources familiar with the development.Should this plan come to fruition, it would be the first IPO by an automaker in India in over 20 years since Maruti Suzuki went public in 2003.According to an ET report, following the DRHP submission, Hyundai Motor India's management is expected to kick off investor roadshows in both domestic and international markets from next month. This information was shared by an investment banker who wished to remain anonymous due to the confidential nature of the discussions.Sebi is anticipated to grant its approval within a span of 60-90 days post-DRHP filing. This timeline indicates that Hyundai Motor India's IPO could potentially debut in the market by September or October.The company has engaged several prominent investment banks, including Citibank, Morgan Stanley, Kotak Mahindra, HSBC, and JPMorgan, to steer the IPO process.The automaker aims to leverage the robust performance of the Indian equities market, which has delivered an impressive annual return of 14% over the past decade, placing it among the top five globally best-performing markets.In February, the financial daily had reported that Hyundai is eyeing a valuation of $22-28 billion for its Indian division.

Paint sector in India will double by FY27 to 7.8 billion litre per annum: Crisil,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/paint-sector-in-india-will-double-by-fy27-to-7-8-billion-litre-per-annum-crisil/articleshow/110908392.cms,"MUMBAI: The organized paints sector in India is on the cusp of significant expansion, with production capacity expected to nearly double to about 7.8 billion litres per annum (blpa) by fiscal 2027 , as per CRISIL report.According to a press release, this surge will be fuelled by investments amounting to around Rs 19,000 crore, including significant contributions from a new major player entering the market.However, heightened competition and increased marketing expenses are likely to impact profitability in the sector.A substantial portion of the new capacity, approximately 2.4 blpa, is anticipated to become operational within the current fiscal year, with the new entrant alone adding 1.3 blpa.This expansion is predominantly within the decorative segment, which represents 75-80 per cent of total production.The sector is poised to continue its healthy volume growth trajectory of 10-15 per cent annually, consistent with past trends.However, the influx of new capacities is expected to intensify competition for market share.This increased competition is likely to drive manufacturers to adopt aggressive pricing strategies to attract customers and maximize the utilization of their expanded capacities, particularly in the value segment, which accounts for over half of the total revenue.Consequently, overall revenue growth is forecasted to moderate to 7-10 per cent this fiscal year.Moreover, operating profitability is projected to decline to 15-17 per cent, influenced by increased marketing expenditures and pressure on product realizations.Despite these challenges, capital expenditure (capex) will be managed through a combination of cash flows, debt, and surplus liquidity, ensuring that the sector can sustain its growth ambitions.The credit profiles of existing manufacturers are expected to remain stable due to their robust financial health, characterized by nearly debt-free balance sheets and substantial liquidity reserves, equivalent to about one-fourth of their net worth.This financial stability will enable them to weather the competitive pressures.A study of six firms, which account for roughly 90 per cent of the organized sector's gross sales of approximately Rs 70,000 crore, supports this optimistic outlook.Poonam Upadhyay, Director of CRISIL Ratings , remarked, ""The projected volume growth of 10-15 per cent this fiscal will be driven by sustained demand from both retail and business-to-business segments, catering to sectors such as construction, real estate, and automobiles.""He added, ""The increase in disposable incomes, consumer preference for quality and branded products, rising home sales, and an anticipated recovery in rural demand will all contribute positively. Nevertheless, pressure on realizations will partially offset the advantages of higher volume, moderating revenue growth this fiscal.""In the previous fiscal year, the paint sector experienced a modest revenue growth of approximately 4 per cent.This was due to manufacturers reducing prices by 4-5 per cent through increased discounts and rebates as crude-linked input prices softened.To combat competition, manufacturers also ramped up promotional spending.Consequently, while the gross margin improved by around 500 basis points, the operating margin increased by only 300 basis points to about 20 per cent, up from 17.0 per cent in fiscal 2023.Prices of key raw materials, particularly those linked to crude oil, such as binders, solvents, and additives, as well as titanium dioxide, are expected to remain stable, which should help maintain gross margins in the 40-42 per cent range this fiscal year.However, the operating profitability is likely to moderate to 15-17 per cent, driven by higher advertising and promotional expenses aimed at supporting retail network expansion and bolstering brand recognition amid rising competition.Additionally, new entrants are expected to incur operational losses during their initial years.To maintain their competitive edge and broaden their product range, existing manufacturers are diversifying into non-paint categories such as adhesives, construction chemicals, and waterproofing products.Consequently, investments in capacity expansion, backward integration, research and development, and technology have been increasing.Anil More, Associate Director of CRISIL Ratings, commented, ""We expect the credit quality of existing manufacturers to remain largely stable despite significant capex. They are likely to finance capex through cash surplus and accruals, while new entrants will rely on a mix of debt and fresh equity.""He added, ""Although key debt metrics are expected to moderate, the interest coverage and debt/Ebitda ratios for the sample set will remain comfortable at 14-16x and 0.5-0.7x, respectively, for this and the next fiscal, compared to previous peaks of over 40x and less than 0.1x, respectively.""Key risk factors that will require close monitoring include the impact of volatile crude oil prices on raw material costs, currency fluctuations, an anticipated recovery in rural demand, and an unexpected surge in competitive intensity as new capacities come online.","The organized paints sector in India is on the cusp of significant expansion. Production capacity is expected to nearly double to about 7.8 billion litres per annum (blpa) by fiscal 2027. This surge will be fuelled by investments amounting to around Rs 19,000 crore.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110908547,imgsize-813928,width-400,resizemode-4/110908547.jpg"

Over 3.8 lakh developers from India made over 9.7 million contributions to open-source last year. In comparison, in 2022, over 3.2 lakh developers from India made over 8.1 million contributions to open source.From reaping the benefits of AI pair programming to accelerating the next era of software development, GitHub is improving developers' productivity. Last year, GitHub surpassed $1 billion in annual recurring revenue. Recently, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said GitHub revenue accelerated to over 40% year-over-year, driven by the growth and adoption of the GitHub AI developer tool Copilot. GitHub Copilot has 1.8 million paid subscribers and has been embraced by over 50,000 firms globally, including Autodesk, Dell, and Goldman Sachs. In India, GitHub counts Cognizant, Infosys, MakeMyTrip, and Paytm among its top customers. Among its recent AI features, Copilot Enterprise, tailors Copilot to a company’s codebase and allows developers to converse with it in natural language.Dohmke grew up in Berlin in a suburb called Marzahn on the East side of the wall, before it fell. ""The complexity of software systems has increased compared to the early '90s. There wasn't much software back then, but today you can’t imagine a world without software,"" he said. When asked about how GitScore, along with GenAI, could be the ultimate litmus test in understanding developer proficiency, Dohmke said that in many interviews, instead of asking the developer to write code, interviewers ask them to use a copilot to write the same piece of code. “This shows their prompting and reasoning skills. It provides good insights into whether the developer not only understands how to work with models, but also how they're validating the code that was written. This, in turn, allows developers to learn more about GitHub Copilot to upskill themselves in prompt engineering, learning how to use a large language model by writing prompts and refining them within the context of what they are working on. It’s a bit like learning how to drive a car,"" he said. GitScore offers a comprehensive overview of a developer's GitHub profile statistics and code analysis results.Regulations like GDPR are upholding data privacy and have significant implications on how AI systems process personal data. ""We're actually interested in enabling open source and open research on GitHub, despite all these regulations (data privacy and AI). Because somebody with a great idea here in Bengaluru cannot afford the same compliance teams as we have at Microsoft or Infosys,"" Dohmke added.","The developer community in India on GitHub is projected to surpass that of the United States, which currently stands at 21 million, by 2027. ""About 200,000 computer science graduates are coming out of engineering degrees, and that creates a convergence,"" said GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110925960,imgsize-574444,width-400,resizemode-4/110925960.jpg"

The finance minister set the stage for a ""Viksit Bharat by 2047"", on the core principles of ‘Sabka Saath’, ‘Sabka Vikas’, ‘Sabka Vishwas’, with ‘Sabka Prayas’ being added as a new theme in the interim Budget.This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data i.e., farmer welfare and N for Nari utthan i.e., support for women entrepreneurs. These form the pillars of a comprehensive inclusive development. The Government's commitment to sustainable development under the strategy for Amrit Kaal includes achieving 'Net Zero' by 2070, rooftop solarization for one crore households and robust health initiatives.The Indian economy's resilience takes center stage amidst positive indicators of declining current account deficit as a percentage of GDP, falling unemployment rates, and a notable rise in digital transactions. These statistics affirm the robustness of the economy, showcasing a trajectory of growth and stability.The achievements in taxation reforms are nothing short of remarkable, with direct tax collections more than trebling in the last decade, the number of tax return filers increasing by 2.4 times, average processing time of tax returns plummeting from 93 days in FY 2013-14 to an impressive 10 days in FY 2023-24, resulting in issuance of quick refunds. These are the results of consistent progressive measures thus obviating the need for, and rightly avoiding, any last-minute populist measures.No change in existing tax rates, both for direct and indirect taxes, is a good indicator of stability and predictability for investors and taxpayers.A welcome move to waive outstanding tax demands that are minor, disputed, and unreconciled. This involves the withdrawal of outstanding direct tax demands up to Rs. 25,000 pertaining to the period up to FY 2009-10 and up to Rs.10,000 for FY 2010-11 to 2014-15.The Government's commitment to fostering a business-friendly environment is evident in its intent to extend specific tax benefits for start-ups, investments by sovereign wealth funds/ pension funds, and certain IFSC units. The extension has been made now until March 31, 2025. This might help in creating a conducive landscape for business.To align with the CBDT notification issued earlier, the provisions relating to tax collection at source concerning remittances under the Liberalized Remittance Scheme have now been formally incorporated in the Finance Bill, 2024, setting the rate at 20% for amounts exceeding Rs. 7 lakhs in a financial year.The Finance Bill, 2024 proposes an extension of the time limit for introducing the faceless scheme by the Central Government for transfer pricing proceedings, DRP Proceedings, and ITAT Proceedings, up to March 31, 2025.The interim Budget 2024 may not have proposed significant tax announcements, but it very well positioned the prelude to the full budget post the upcoming elections. Considering the potential impact on the population across the four pillars of GYAN, a sizable portion of India stands to be covered. The interim Budget’s focus on the tax front resembles a report card, highlighting the maturity achieved by our tax system. The enhancement of taxpayer services was emphasized as a key priority.","This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data and N for Nari utthan.

Interim Budget for a Viksit Bharat: It’s for everyone and all,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/interim-budget-for-a-viksit-bharat-its-for-everyone-and-all/articleshow/107497439.cms,"By Akhilesh Tuteja

The Finance Minister on February 01, 2024, delivered a truly innovative interim budget. At first glance, it did not seem like an interim budget but looked more like the budget to drive further growth and a continuum of inclusive growth-oriented investments.At the outset, this budget brings a wonderful balance between fiscal prudence and continued investment for growth. It's not easy to continue the glide path of reducing the fiscal deficit and continuing to make significant investments in all areas including infrastructure, R&D, energy transition, technology, skilling, and social welfare. The surprising reduction in fiscal deficit of 5.8% as against the budgeted 5.9% for FY24 and the projection of 5.1% in FY25 with a clear focus on increasing investments was a huge positive.This was a budget for everyone and all because it caters to every part of the Indian economy and society. The FM has carefully catered to the investment needs of various sectors. The continued focus on youth, impoverished, women and farmers to increase their involvement and contribution to economic growth is evident. By committing an 11.1% increase in capital expenditure to 11,11,111 lakh crore, the FM has clearly brought every single 1 in this growth journey.What was very impressive was the inclusion strategy of the government. The focus on women's empowerment for the past few years is unprecedented, which is reflected in the inclusion of women in the workforce moving from 23.3% to 37% in the last five years. The thirty crore Mudra Yojna loans to women entrepreneurs were a great boost to the Nari Shakti initiative. We already have over 10 million Lakhpati Didis and what is truly evident is like a corporate CFO, the FM has revised the earlier target of 20 million Lakhpati Didis to 30 million. The government also plans to invest in initiatives to encourage young girls between the ages of 9 and 14 to undertake the vaccination for cervical cancer which is again a great boost to Nari Shakti.A lot needs to be done to bring more women into all parts of economic growth but the journey so far and the vision of the future is truly inspiring.While India continues on its technological prowess and makes its mark in new technologies like Artificial Intelligence, we need a multi-pronged strategy to harness the power of AI. We need a clear focus on building AI systems in India so that we not only emerge as a global leader in this new era but can build models, which are specific to India that will benefit Indians. At the same time, we need a very wide coverage program to build skills to leverage AI to its fullest potential. The biggest contribution we can make to the inclusion of youth in the economic development of the country is by skilling them in new skill areas. In the last few years, the Skill India Mission has trained 14 million youth, reskilled over 5 million youth and established a staggering 3,000 new ITIs. The future of any country will depend as much on capital investments as on skill investments.The focus on agricultural development and support to the farmer continues through direct financial assistance to farmers. The farmers have benefited by getting crop insurance through PM Fasal Bima Yojana. It's not just the farmers, the PM-SVANidhi provides credit assistance to a large number of street vendors.The last few years have seen the journey of affordable housing through Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY). There is a slight increase in allocation to launch a scheme for encouraging the middle class to build or buy new homes. This investment will likely propel a wider economic development and increase employment.India has seen a tremendous rise in entrepreneurship in the last few years. In order to continue the journey and promote new startups, the government proposes to extend certain tax benefits, which are expiring from March 2024 to March 2025. The MSMEs have not been left behind. With a proposal to provide timely finances to such enterprises, the government has paved the way for their growth, so they can look to compete globally.All in all, it’s a truly inclusive budget with a clear focus on development not just by giving away freebies but enabling the people to participate in the economic development activity. While the FM calls the comprehensive GDP - Governance, Development & Performance – to me, this budget is inclusive of another GDP – gender, demography, and professions.","Akhilesh Tuteja is Partner and Head, Clients and Markets, KPMG in India.

‘Enough domestic sources of demand to counter drag from external sector’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/enough-domestic-sources-of-demand-to-counter-drag-from-external-sector/articleshow/107372012.cms,"Do you think the

creates room for lower interest rates?

One of the issues that the Budget has flagged is the demographic challenge and opportunity and the societal change that is taking place. How do you view this?

Niti Aayog is working on the Viksit Bharat roadmap. What will be the focus areas?

You are as much a representative of the Centre as well as the states. Is it time to revisit the entire formula for transfers to states particularly on the issue of cesses and surcharges?

Suman Bery , who heads Niti Aayog , the govt think tank, is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China, which he says is also an opportunity for India. The economist is confident that Indian states remain resilient. Excerpts of the interview with TOI.The finance ministry expects the economy to grow 7% next year. Given the global situation, how do you see the prospects?The belief in the finance ministry is that we have a possible drag coming from the external sector but that we have other sources. We have enough domestic sources of demand. One has to applaud the political and economic judgment of FM in deciding that it was appropriate to pursue the path of fiscal consolidation. There is transparency. What this actually reflects is responsible economic management, which is one reason we are where we are. Second, it also creates a buffer so that there is policy space if we do encounter headwinds.That’s the hope and expectation. We have an independent central bank and an inflation targeting central bank, so it is up to the monetary policy committee to take a call through the monetary policy committee on the repo rate .The PM has said that when India grows its states grow. India is a composite of 37 states and UTs. They are each at very different points in their demographic transition. There are some states where the net replacement rate is down to 1%, like Kerala . There are others, particularly UP and Bihar, which are in their earliest stage of demographic transition and each one of these states is the size of a large European country. There are two implications of that — one is internal labour mobility and it will become an even larger part of our growth model. The govt has taken several steps to create a unified market. Our main endowment is our human capital and that has to be equipped to participate in global exchange in many ways. We know from China, Japan that the demographic dividend partly depends on markets and on human capital. But the golden period is fairly short lived, about 15 years, when the so called dependency ratio declines. The other big opportunity the PM has been highlighting is bringing women much more into the active labour force.When Niti was set up there was the idea of a three-year vision and a seven-year strategy paper. The reality is that schemes of govt tend to be aligned with the award of the Finance Commission . There are various established building blocks or hand holds which are already a matter of govt policy. The PM is much more interested in a national debate on what it means to be a Viksit Bharat or modern society. We have a collective goal and it is for the democratic polity to define what that goal should be. Its emphatically not for a super mandarin bureaucracy. It is not going to be Lee Kwan Yew’s Singapore led from the top.It’s entirely a finance ministry matter but I would be lying if I didn’t say when I visit certain states there is this complaint. A big frontier would be resource mobilisation at the state level. Second is going to be rationalisation of subsidies not only at the Union level, but also at the state level. All chief ministers sit on my governing council. When they convene as the governing council, I see them in their role as development practitioners. The world is beginning to appreciate quite how much institutional and political maturity India attained in our 75 years and the most fundamental dimension of a democracy, we have orderly transfers of power. There are enough buffers to ensure that what happens in state finances is unlikely to create macro instability. Those risks are well contained by our Constitution. The chief ministers know that they are going to be judged by development outcomes and so you can have the sugar rush of changing of pension plans or various handouts but if the cupboard is bare you are not going to be able to deliver.","Suman Bery is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China.

Government's Marathon to 2047: Emphasis on Fiscal Prudence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/governments-marathon-to-2047-emphasis-on-fiscal-prudence/articleshow/107371788.cms,"What was the thinking behind keeping the vote on account absolutely straight?

So is it the idea to keep the Budget completely transparent?

The capex has risen 11.1% and there is an emphasis on infrastructure spending. But there is also the hope that the private sector will now take over and start capital spending. Given the geopolitical situation, how confident is the govt that it will pan out as planned?

Finance secretary T V Somanathan, in an interview with TOI, says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047 . Excerpts:If you see the Budget speech you will see the emphasis on 2047. The govt has set its sight on running that marathon. Running to 2047 is a marathon , it’s not a sprint. If you are going to run a marathon, you need to be in good shape and you can’t have short-term stimulants or something that will get you some yards and then it’s done.The whole focus is on making India a developed country by 2047, for which a healthy present and a strong fiscal position is an important concomitant. Some purely short term measures don’t really fit into that picture. It’s a consistent picture: focus on the long term for which you need to build strength in the short term and that needs to be done by prudence in fiscal policy and by not doing things which can detract you from that path. Not doing the wrong thing is more important than appearing to do things.The idea is that govt finances may be good, bad or indifferent depending on the times, depending on the circumstances, depending on the policies. But what is the position should be reflected as reasonably and accurately as possible. That is an emphasis. As regards the Finance Commission, again the terms of reference that have been given to them are the terms in the Constitution.What is the means by which the devolution should be done is a matter they have full discretion. They can actually take all kinds of factors into account and in a sense we felt this time based on my review of the previous commissions that the right expression would be less is more. The shorter, less prescriptive terms of reference gives full scope for all stakeholders including state govts to express their viewpoints and for the commission to take a balanced view of the different perspectives and then come to its award. Ultimately the award of the Finance Commission is about devolution and grant for which full scope has now been given to them.n There are incipient signs of private capital expenditure accelerating. There are some surveys I have seen done by some of the chambers industry, which show high levels of investment. The PMI, which is a sort of leading indicator, is also looking pretty healthy. Capacity utilisation is one reason that private sector capital expenditure doesn’t immediately pick up when the economy starts accelerating because there is surplus capacity.But increasingly I get the sense that many industries are beginning to reach levels where they have to add capacity. When that happens capital investment will happen. Another pointer also mentioned in the Budget speech you may notice that our airlines have placed large orders for planes — that is capital expenditure.When you import 1,000 aircraft, it’s just not 1,000 aircraft, there are concomitant additions to ground handling facilities, you need airports to expand, you need to employ people to do that. That means a lot of jobs. The aircraft is capital but then look at the effect it is going to have on skilled jobs. So capital expenditure is happening. I am fairly confident that we will have decent capital expenditure in the year to come and that will become a new source of acceleration.",Finance secretary T V Somanathan says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047. The capex has risen 11.1% and there is an emphasis on infrastructure spending.

What is the Section 80C limit for tax deduction for FY 2024-25 after Interim Budget 2024?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/income-tax-budget-2024-2024-2025-section-80c-limit-epf-ppf-elss-nsc/articleshow/107353021.cms,"ALSO READ |

Income Tax Changes Budget 2024 : In the recent Budget 2024 speech, the Finance Minister kept the Section 80C tax deduction limit unchanged. The maximum limit for claiming tax benefits under Section 80C remains at Rs 1.5 lakh for the current fiscal year 2023-24 and will stay the same for individuals looking to save on taxes through Section 80C investments in the upcoming fiscal year 2024-25.Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions. Individuals can reduce their gross taxable income by up to Rs 1.5 lakh per financial year by engaging in these specific investments or expenditures.You can save on taxes through Section 80C by investing in things like Employees' Provident Fund (EPF), Public Provident Fund (PPF), Equity Linked Saving Scheme (ELSS) mutual funds, National Savings Certificate (NSC), and 5-year tax-saving fixed deposits with banks or post offices. Additionally, paying life insurance policy premiums also qualifies for tax benefits under Section 80C.It is important to note that each eligible investment comes with its specific maximum limit, rate of return, liquidity, and taxation rules for the earned returns, states ET in a report. For instance, the most you can invest in PPF in a financial year is Rs 1.5 lakh. Meanwhile, there's no limit on the amount you can invest in ELSS mutual funds, but the Section 80C deduction is capped at Rs 1.5 lakh.If individuals can't make specific investments, they can still get deductions under Section 80C from their gross taxable income through certain expenses. These expenses include repaying the principal amount of a home loan, tuition fees for children, payment of stamp duty, registration fees, and other costs related to buying a house.Since the financial year 2020-21, individuals without any business income must annually choose between the old and new tax regimes. As of the fiscal year 2023-24, the new tax regime is the default option. Consequently, individuals seeking tax deductions under Section 80C must opt for the old tax regime since this deduction isn't available in the new tax regime. It's crucial for taxpayers to be aware of these rules to make informed decisions about their tax planning and investment strategies.","Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions.

Budget 2024 focuses on youth and women entrepreneurship,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/budget-2024-focuses-on-youth-and-women-entrepreneurship/articleshow/107357923.cms,"By

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget which is an interim budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year. The budget talks about inclusive development both, social and geographical, especially for youth, women, farmers, and the poor. Continued focus on improving logistics through infrastructure spend on roads, rail, airports, ports increases productivity for companies and citizens alike.To make ‘Viksit Bharat’ by 2047, the government’s focus is on improving and empowering people’s capabilities through various skilling initiatives. It is encouraging to see that Skill India Mission has succeeded in training more than 1.4 crore youth and upskilling and reskilling 54 lakh youth. I am particularly happy to see the continued focus on youth and women entrepreneurship and the announcement of a new fund which will give interest free 50 year loans for startups will provide a domestic fillip to startups supplementing venture capital we have traditionally relied on from abroad.PM Mudra Yojana has sanctioned 43 crore loans aggregating to 22.5 lakh crore to youth entrepreneurs and thirty crore Mudra Yojana loans to women entrepreneurs. There are several other schemes like Fund of Funds, Start-Up India, and Start-Up Credit Guarantee schemes that are assisting our youth. Further, the extension of tax benefits to Start-ups and investments made by sovereign wealth funds/pension funds, till 31st March 2025 depicts the government’s effort to support the startup eco- system.This aligns quite well with India Sanitation Coalition’s efforts to give impetus to the start-up world. Over the past 7 editions of our ISC-FICCI Sanitation Awards, we have recognized and promoted several start-ups in the sanitation space, many of whom are successful businesses now!While the finance minister did not provide detailed information on Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH), the budget allocation sees a slight increase in spend demonstrating continued focus on this highly successful program. The acknowledgement that the private sector has increasingly played a substantial role in addressing WASH issues in both urban and rural areas, with numerous projects underway through Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs), highlights the government's commitment to addressing challenges in this sector.A perfect example is the LightHouse Initiative initiated by the Department of Drinking Water along with the India Sanitation Coalition (ISC) by partnering with major corporates across India to develop model villages in Solid and Liquid Waste Management (SLWM) under SBM-Grameen. From this budget, there is an expectation that the government will persist in prioritizing Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) as the path toward achieving the country's Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6). Additionally, it is hoped that the government will uphold its commitment to making necessary infrastructural investments for SLWM.The budget speech rightly celebrates the fact that we have 83 lakh SHGs and 9 crore women beneficiaries. The microfinance movement in the country and the possibility of empowering women members of SHGs through livelihood skilling is a key to bringing women into mainstream economic advancement.The focus on green growth, rooftop solar, wind, biomass, e-vehicles all help with our green energy thrust. The tourism sector was mentioned and could be a huge job provider for youth and women.Guided by the principle ‘Reform, Perform, and Transform’, the budget emphasizes efficient implementation of various policies by improving coordination with states and relevant stakeholders. This is critical both for infra spend and social programsIt is noteworthy that ISC’s Climate Resilient Coastal Cities project which is being implemented in PPP (Public-Private Partnership) mode in four coastal states of Karnataka, Gujarat, Goa and Maharashtra is congruent with the government’s priority of promoting climate-resilient activities for the blue economy 2.0, a scheme for restoration and adaptation measures, and coastal aquaculture.The budget also focuses on the Aspirational districts program where assistance will be given to the states for faster development of aspirational districts and blocks, including the generation of ample economic opportunities. This is again very crucial as it has a huge potential to transform the landscape of our country while making sure no -one is left behind.Overall, this budget has embraced economic strategies and develops the building blocks that nurture and uphold growth, promote inclusive and sustainable development, and enhance productivity.","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year.

Rupee logs new record low of 83.57 vs dollar,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rupee-logs-new-record-low-of-83-57-vs-dollar/articleshow/110923763.cms,"Mumbai: The rupee weakened to a new low of 83.57 against the dollar in the interbank foreign exchange market on Tuesday. The dollar gained against most Asian currencies ahead of the US Fed 's meeting on Wednesday.

The rupee has been under pressure this week. After closing lower at 83.51 on Monday, the currency opened weak on renewed demand for dollars. It would have slipped further but for dollar sales by public sector banks ostensibly on behalf of RBI. ""I expect the rupee to come under pressure... it could slip to 83.75-83.90 within a month. There are no substantial flows expected before the Budget. Even the $2 billion expected later this month on account of the country's inclusion in the JP Morgan emerging bond indices will be easily absorbed,"" said KN Dey, a forex consultant.

Dealers said that a large private equity firm had taken dollars out on Tuesday, leading to pressure on the rupee. Foreign Institutional Investors were net sellers in the stock markets, having sold shares worth Rs 111 crore, according to exchange data.

""The rupee traded weak, due to the rising dollar index near 105. Participants are keenly awaiting the US CPI data release on Wednesday, which is crucial for market movements,"" said Jateen Trivedi, VP research analyst (commodity and currency), LKP Securities. ""Additionally, the upcoming US Fed policy and statement are significant, as they will provide projections and guidance on future economic conditions. These events will heavily influence the dollar and, consequently, the rupee's performance,"" added Trivedi. A hawkish Fed will keep the dollar strong as higher rates in the US will hold back capital flows from the US.

According to a report by Emkay Global, despite easing political uncertainty, the rupee will be under pressure in the short term because of renewed demand for dollars from local importers and Indian equity outflows. However, potential intervention from RBI might support the Indian rupee, limiting the upside for the currency pair.

While a weaker rupee will add to inflationary pressures and make offshore expenditure on travel and education costlier, many expect RBI to ease its grip on the currency and allow some depreciation. This is primarily to improve export competitiveness.

According to India Ratings, the nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) and real effective exchange rate (REER) indicate a widening gap since FY21, with NEER declining and REER remaining flat. This divergence suggests increasing inflation differentials between India and its trading partners, which is eroding India's export competitiveness. NEER measures a country's currency value relative to a basket of other major currencies, while REER adjusts NEER for inflation differentials between the country and its trading partners.

"India fastest growing economy, to record 6.7% growth over 3 years: World Bank",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/india-fastest-growing-economy-to-record-6-7-growth-over-3-years-world-bank/articleshow/110917223.cms,"NEW DELHI: A recently released World Bank report has forecasted India's growth to be at 6.7 per cent over the next three years, including the current fiscal year.The Global Economic Prospects report, released on Tuesday, estimates India's growth to have accelerated to 8.2 per cent in FY 2023/24 (April 2023 to March 2024), which is 1.9 percentage points higher than the January estimate.Additionally, the report also predicts that global growth will remain steady at 2.6 per cent in 2024 before slightly increasing to an average of 2.7 per cent in 2025-26. However, this growth rate is significantly lower than the 3.1 per cent average observed in the decade prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.""The forecast implies that over the course of 2024-26 countries that collectively account for more than 80 per cent of the world's population and global GDP would still be growing more slowly than they did in the decade before COVID-19,"" report stated.Meanwhile, growth is expected to decelerate from 6.6 per cent in 2023 to 6.2 per cent in 2024 in the South Asia (SAR) region, primarily due to a moderation in India's growth from a high base in recent years.However, with India's steady growth, the regional growth is projected to remain at 6.2 per cent in 2025-26. Other economies in the region, such as Bangladesh, are expected to maintain robust growth, albeit at a slower pace than in previous years, while Pakistan and Sri Lanka are anticipated to experience strengthened growth.The report highlights that India's growth moderation is mainly attributed to a slowdown in investment from a high base. Nevertheless, investment growth is still expected to be stronger than previously anticipated and remain robust throughout the forecast period, driven by strong public investment accompanied by private investment. Additionally, private consumption growth is expected to benefit from a recovery in agricultural production and declining inflation , while government consumption is projected to grow slowly, in line with the government's goal of reducing current expenditure relative to GDP.Globally, the World Bank expects inflation to moderate to 3.5 per cent in 2024 and 2.9 per cent in 2025, although the pace of decline is slower than projected six months ago. Consequently, many central banks are expected to remain cautious in lowering policy interest rates, with global interest rates likely to remain high by recent decades' standards, averaging around 4 per cent over 2025-26, which is approximately double the 2000-19 average. In India, inflation has remained within the Reserve Bank's target range of 2 to 6 per cent since September 2023. However, apart from India, regional inflation has remained elevated, reflecting persistently high food price inflation due to local food supply disruptions and increased energy prices.","A recently released World Bank report has forecasted India's growth to be at 6.7 per cent over the next three years, including the current fiscal year.

The meme market has been on fire all year, and this week is no different! The popular dog-themed Shiba Inu leads the pack with a gravity-defying skyrocketing SHIB burn rate. Although Floki price faces a downward spiral, a new red-hot meme coin, Raboo, has rekindled optimism amid the rollercoaster ride in the meme market. This new upstart is burning up the meme market with an astonishing $1.6M raise and thousands of investors flocking in daily. Is the meme frenzy just getting started? Let's get into the specifics.Shiba Inu’s commitment to providing and improving value for its community is noteworthy, and the recent increase in burn rate is solid proof. According to the Shibburn tracker, the SHIB burn rate saw a remarkable 348% upswing that hints at a potential breakout. The effect is a bullish uprise that took its price from the tight-bounded range at $0.000024 to $0.00002511 within 24 hours.On the fundamental front, Shiba Inu (SHIB) went above and beyond. In addition to the surge in the Shib burn rate, there has been a considerable uptick in ecosystem development and on-chain metrics. While the increasing Shib burn rate looks like the much-needed push Shiba Inu (SHIB) needs to get out of the $0.000022 and $0.000025 resistance range, its price still grapples with bear pressure. Currently, its price is milling around $0.000025 with a 3.48% intraday decline. Inspired by Shiba Inu's success, Floki (FLOKI)'s rise to the top of the meme game is solely because of its enormous backing from its supportive community and meme enthusiasts. Floki leaped above a $2B valuation in no time, and the rest is history.Despite the brilliant start and visionary four core roadmap activities, Floki price struggles to maintain its momentum and value . Its 7-day gains, standing at an impressive 16.2%, have been hit by a short-term 0.80% decline that took its price down a peg. Trading volume decreased within the same period, filling investors with foreboding. However, analysts think Floki price will still recover, especially after the recent alliance and massive $12M investment from DWF Labs.Shiba Inu and Floki (FLOKI) have proven that getting in on a blue-chip asset is key to successful crypto investment. However, getting in on a huge potential asset at its presale is even better. While Shiba Inu and Floki (FLOKI) seem to have maxed out their potential, Raboo keeps the game alive with a unique twist.Savvy investors are flocking to secure their stake in its ingenuity. Its record-breaking presale surged 60% to $0.0048 in Stage 4, with over $1.6M raised already. Central to this ingenuity is a mission to build the world's first inclusive AI-powered social-fi meme ecosystem. Anyone can leverage its AI backing to hone meme-hunting skills and connect with like-minded meme enthusiasts.While at it, Raboo will introduce the post-to-earn program for anyone to monetize user-generated content from its proprietary Rabooscan tool. Besides, it will offer a fun-filled contest for token holders to earn passive income in addition to staking rewards, an upcoming NFT collection, exclusive content, and incentivized participation.Unlike many pump-and-dump meme projects, Shiba Inu (SHIB), Floki (FLOKI), and Raboo have proven to be the face of sustainable and viable meme culture. However, Raboo still stands out in stark contrast to the dwindling price of Shiba Inu and Floki. Its security audit, deflationary tokenomics, and meticulously crafted roadmap hint at a revolution that will remain forever. You can participate in the Raboo presale here.

Bitcoin and Ethereum are the world's largest cryptocurrencies. They are considered the blue-chip cryptos, although they have experienced their fair share of ups and downs. New investors often confine their portfolios to BTC and ETH to keep things simple.But the crypto market is fast evolving. More projects are emerging with market-relevant utilities and interesting narratives. If these projects take off as envisioned, they stand to gain more than BTC and ETH. Thanks to their low initial market cap, they have larger rooms for returns.PlayDoge (PLAY) is on top of this list. While meme coins are hardly considered robust cryptocurrencies, PlayDoge ($PLAY) is one of the rare exceptions. As the name implies, it is a meme coin and a play-to-earn coin. It combines both to power one of the most promising cryptocurrencies this yearPlayDoge adopts a Tamagotchi style and gives a new twist to the 90s craze with meme coin packaging. The platform brings a wide range of 2D min games in its 8-bit universe, where players can adopt, nurture, and interact with their virtual pet Doges. Players who successfully navigate the game levels and climb up the leaderboards stand to earn attractive rewards in $PLAY tokens.In less than two weeks of going live, PlayDoge is closing in on the $3M milestone. The buying frenzy is driven by its engaging gameplay that taps into 90s nostalgia. PlayDoge offers gamers an exciting way to earn a side income. But what about those not interested in gaming? Then investing is the way to go. To further motivate investors (long-term investors, in particular), PlayDoge has implemented a compelling staking system with attractive APYs.The project looks robust on the technical side as well. To ensure minimal gas fees and seamless transactions, PlayDoge is building its kennel on the BNB Smart Chain. Being a play-to-earn project with viral potential, PlayDoge could replicate the success of projects like Floki Inu. Powered by the hype around the Valhalla play-to-earn game, FLOKI has grown to a staggering $2.5 billion market cap over the years.WienerAI (WAI) is next. The project gives the impression of a meme coin, and it is a meme coin, but also much more than that.WienerAI is an advanced trading bot that functions similarly to a personal trading guru. All you need to do to get WienerAI’s assistance is type in your question, and the bot takes care of the rest. It scours the market for the latest opportunities, hidden market gems, and research-backed insights that can change the game.For WienerAI, the meme coin packaging inspired by the popular dog coin trends is a means to draw viral attention. Its core mission is to make crypto trading accessible and affordable to all. The project helps users with seamless swaps, zero fees, and MEV protection.Through this powerful and playful branding, WienerAI provides a fresh take on trading solutions. The solutions are tailored for both novice and experienced traders. The real-time insights help users sharpen their market strategies.At the time of writing, the presale raise of $WAI stood at $4.9M. In the presale, the token is available for purchase at heavily discounted prices. But the discounts and staking APY decrease as the presale progresses, favouring early investors.Learn-to-earn platform 99Bitcoins (99BTC) just recently launched the presale of its native token, $99BTC. It is on its way to the $2M milestone now.99Bitcoins is one of the hottest crypto education hubs in the market, with over 709K followers, 2845K subscribers, and 79 hours of crypto courses. Investors looking for utility coins with high market relevance are behind the rapid progress of the $99BTC presale. In addition, 99Bitcoins uses the BRC-20 standard to pioneer the L2E model on the Bitcoin blockchain . With Bitcoin predicted to take off toward the end of the year, 99Bitcoins capitalises on the optimistic outlook.Base Dawgz (DAWGZ) is a meme coin built on the Base blockchain. Base meme coins are all the craze this season. So it comes as no surprise why DAWGZ is trending. It is predicted to be the next meme coin on the Base blockchain to explode.Although the token doesn’t have any utility, the speculative FOMO around the meme coin substantiates its growth potential. Base blockchain is one of the fastest-growing crypto hubs of 2024.Brett (BRETT) and Degen are good examples of the Base frenzy in the meme coin market. The blockchain lays a robust foundation for sensational projects.Another element that adds to the Base Dawgz craze is its unique mascot – an animated Shiba Inu dog in a base-jumping suit and goggles. On the technical side, DAWGZ features a multichain infrastructure. It allows investors to smoothly transfer their tokens between networks like Ethereum, Solana, BNB Chain, and Avalanche. At the same time, the token taps into the Base craze.Base Dawgz also has a staking protocol to help investors grow their holdings, in addition to market value appreciation. The project has launched a campaign to push Base into the limelight. This share-to-earn campaign encourages investors to share Base Dawgz memes on social media to earn attractive rewards. More community reward programmes are in the pipeline, although specifics have yet to be announced.DAWGZ has no team allocation and the project has undergone a security audit by Solidproof, thus mitigating concerns for early investors. The ongoing presale opens the cheapest gateway to the meme coin. Investors can now grab $DAWGZ before the debut exchange listings for low prices at the presale.",PlayDoge (PLAY) is one of the most promising cryptocurrencies this year.

Microsoft took an early lead in the race to commercialise AI through its bet on OpenAI. But shares of the iPhone maker were down nearly 2% in afternoon trading as investors sought more AI announcements.The AI features were unveiled at its Worldwide Developers Conference and Apple also showed its latest operating system for its Vision Pro mixed-reality headset and iPhone.The company said the new AI features will come with the latest software for its devices and allow users to summarize text and generate other content, such as personalized animations to wish a friend happy birthday. Apple said the ChatGPT integration would be available later this year and that other AI features will follow, adding that the chatbot could be accessed for free and that users' information will not be logged.As part of the updates, a revamped Siri will also tap in to ChatGPT's expertise and seek permission from users before querying the OpenAI service.While its AI rivals are targeting enterprises, Apple plans to stand out by making the technology relevant to its more than 1 billion users - most of whom are not tech aficionados. Apple said iOS 18, the software powering its flagship device, makes the iPhone home screen more customizable and includes improved versions of its in-house apps.The new software will also come with a ""lock an app"" feature that will help people protect sensitive information. Users can opt to lock specific apps and keep data more tightly controlled in the OS.Apple also said it would group messages in its email client starting later this year, categorizing them in a primary folder, a transactions folder, a promotions folder and other more specific groupings, for instance communications by an airline. The high-level categorizations are similar to a now-old feature in Gmail.

PEPE Coin has recently seen a surge in value following its listing on Coinbase International Exchange despite facing market volatility.

The 1000PEPE-PERP offering has increased liquidity and speculation, although the meme coin has faced some volatility. PEPE trades at $0.00001446, showing a 70% gain over the past month despite a recent 4% dip. This fluctuation was partly due to a major sell-off by a whale who offloaded $5.3 million worth of PEPE, creating mixed market signals. As traders watch the whale activity closely, the question remains whether PEPE can sustain its upward trajectory.Shiba Inu (SHIB) has seen its value drop by nearly 3%, trading at $0.000024. The decline has pushed SHIB below its daily SMA 50, raising investor concerns. Bulls and bears are in a tug-of-war, trying to sustain SHIB above key resistance levels. The cryptocurrency's performance in the $0.000025 to $0.00003 range is critical, with 92.2 trillion SHIB bought in this range. For SHIB to rally, it must overcome significant selling pressure and stabilise above crucial support levels, making its future uncertain.BlockDAG has surged to the top of CoinSniper, creating a significant buzz in the crypto community. This achievement is underscored by a remarkable boost count of 3,269, placing BlockDAG ahead of competitors like Playdoge and Sealana. The anticipation surrounding BlockDAG's future developments, particularly with details still marked as ""To Be Announced"" (TBA) adds to the excitement and mystery. The recent Keynote 2 release has further amplified interest, showcasing BlockDAG's innovative technology and potential to disrupt the blockchain landscape.The Keynote 2 introduced several ground-breaking updates, including the X1 Miner app beta version’s mining capabilities. Now available on Android and Apple platforms, this app enables seamless mining of BlockDAG's native cryptocurrency. The app's features, such as user onboarding and presale functionality, provide a glimpse into the quality and innovation behind BlockDAG's ecosystem. Additionally, the development team has made significant strides in blockchain infrastructure, with ongoing updates detailed on its website.Furthermore, BlockDAG's presale success is another testament to its potential, raising $48.5 million during Batch 18. The project has seen an 1120% increase in value from Batch 1 to 18. This rapid progression and the strategic roadmap towards Batch 45 highlight the project's growth trajectory and investment potential.
