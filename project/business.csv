'War ties': Norway fund to sell Adani Ports stake,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/war-ties-norway-fund-to-sell-adani-ports-stake/articleshow/110187393.cms,"MUMBAI: Norges Bank , Norway's central bank, has decided to exclude Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone from its government pension fund over ethical concerns. This means the $1.7-trillion fund - the world's largest sovereign wealth fund by assets under management - will sell its remaining stake in Adani Ports.The Norwegian pension fund invests in equities and bonds across most countries and markets.In a statement, Norges Bank said it has decided to exclude Adani Ports due to ""unacceptable risk that the company contributes to serious violations of individuals' rights in situations of war or conflict"". The port operator, part of billionaire Gautam Adani's conglomerate, has been under its watch list since March 2022 and that ""observation now ends given the exclusion decision"".Adani Ports didn't respond to TOI's requests for comments on its exclusion from the Norwegian pension fund's portfolio. Norges Bank said its decision to exclude Adani Ports from the fund's portfolio was based on recommendations from Council On Ethics . COE is an independent body that makes recommendations to Norges Bank to either exclude companies from the pension fund or place them under observation. In a statement, the COE said that Adani Ports was under observation ""due to its business association with the armed forces in Myanmar "", which in Feb 2021 staged a military coup.The Indian company was involved with a port terminal in Myanmar, incurring an investment of $150 million. In May 2023, the company disclosed that it sold the Myanmar port to Solar Energy. The COE noted that no information on the buyer is available, and Adani Ports has stated that it cannot share any such information on the grounds of confidentiality. Lack of information means that the COE cannot establish whether Adani Ports still has links to the enterprise concerned.""In a situation in which extremely serious norm violations are taking place, this constitutes an unacceptable risk that the government pension fund's investments in Adani Ports may breach its ethical guidelines"". Norges Bank didn't mention the quantum of stake the government pension fund holds in Adani Ports. The fund has been paring its exposure in Adani Ports over the last several quarters. In Feb 2023, it held 0.3% in Adani Ports. Besides Adani Ports, it held 0.14% in Adani Green and 0.17% in Adani Total Gas. ts latest holding in all the three Adani Group companies couldn't be ascertained.","Norges Bank, Norway's central bank, has decided to exclude Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone from its government pension fund over ethical concerns.

A heavy monsoon season is great news for these Indian stocks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/bse-sensex-monsoon-season-hindustan-unilever-ltd-dabur-hero-motocorp-mahindra-mahindra-ltd/articleshow/110221852.cms,"Stocks of Indian firms that earn a large chunk of their revenues from the nation’s hinterland are showing signs of a revival, as traders bet that bountiful monsoon rains will lead to better crop yields and boost rural demand.Motorcycle manufacturers, farm-equipment makers and producers of fast-moving consumer goods have rallied following forecasts of timely and above-normal monsoon rains in 2024, after extreme and unseasonal heat wreaked havoc on Indian agriculture in the last two years.Sales volumes in rural areas are improving and several major consumer goods firms have predicted stronger business ahead.The Nifty FMCG Index has risen 1.5% so far in May, beating the benchmark NSE Nifty 50 Index by more than two percentage points. It underperformed in each of the previous six months.“The market is expecting a bounce back in rural demand from a good monsoon,” said Sahil Kapoor, a strategist at DSP Mutual Fund in Mumbai. If predictions of an above-average monsoon this year pan out, it will help agricultural output and support rural income, he said.A recovery in rural stocks is also welcome news for India’s broader stock market whose stellar rally in recent years was disproportionately spurred by investment-heavy firms benefiting from the government’s higher infrastructure spending. Further, bountiful showers can aid the central bank’s efforts to cool inflation by curbing gains in food prices, thereby improving prospects for India’s economic growth and corporate earnings.Hindustan Unilever Ltd — seen as a bellwether for consumer appetite in India as its products are sold in every part of the country — has said it sees demand gradually improving. Rival Dabur India Ltd has echoed the same sentiment, while motorcycle maker Hero MotoCorp Ltd has said it sees most of its new vehicle inquiries now coming from rural areas.“We think rural economy is starting to come back,” said Rajeev Agrawal, a fund manager at New-York based DoorDarshi India Fund. “This is reflected in strong two-wheeler sales.”Sales of motorcycles and scooters in India rose 33% on year last month, according to data from the Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations. More broadly, fast-moving consumer goods companies registered sales growth of 7.6% year-on-year in rural areas in the quarter ended March, according to Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd’s research that cites data from Nielsen. That’s the first time the measure outpaced urban growth in three years.To be sure, there are question marks about the momentum and breadth of the rural sector’s demand recovery, given a low base for earnings comparison and the fact that some firms have seen volumes benefiting due to price cuts.“This is still a hope trade,” said DSP Mutual Fund’s Kapoor. “There hasn’t been a meaningful recovery in earnings or sales volumes so far.”To analysts at Morgan Stanley, cyclical businesses are still leading India’s growth and that should result in defensive sectors lagging. “We are still mid-way through this cycle for staples and expect them to continue to underperform and de-rate,” they wrote in a May 9 note.Still, investors’ appetite for stocks tied to the rural sector has strengthened amid growing signs that India’s investment-propelled growth may be losing steam.Shares of Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd, which makes farm equipment such as tractors, are up about 17% this month, the top performers on a gauge of 16 Indian automakers. The stock surged 6% on Friday to a record after better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings, with some analysts citing likely improvement in tractor sales ahead driven by expectation of normal monsoons.Hero MotoCorp’s shares are up 12% so far this month.The sharp drop in machinery imports in the January-March quarter was one of the early indications of capital expenditure weakness, Prateek Parekh and Priyanka Shah, analysts at Nuvama Institutional Equities, wrote in a note. Valuations of both consumer goods and capex-heavy firms have converged, and that is also one reason to pivot toward consumption themes, they added.","The Nifty FMCG Index has risen 1.5% so far in May, beating the benchmark NSE Nifty 50 Index.

This significant achievement marked the end of a record-breaking week, despite mixed performances in European and Asian markets.""We made a breakout to new record high,"" Karl Haeling from LBBW told AFP. ""The market is just choosing to consolidate, which is probably a healthy thing because it's racing and getting too exuberant.""The Dow rose by 0.3%, closing at 40,003.59.The S&P 500 also saw a slight increase, while the Nasdaq ended the day marginally negative.The S&P 500, a key index for Wall Street and retirement savers, increased by 6.17 points, or 0.1%, to close at 5,303.27, just 0.1% below its record high set on Wednesday. It marked its fourth consecutive week of gains. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite slipped by 12.35 points, or 0.1%, to finish at 16,685.97.Beneath the calm surface of the indices, there was notable activity. Reddit surged by 10% following the announcement of a partnership with OpenAI, which will integrate Reddit’s content with ChatGPT and establish an advertising partnership. Wall Street's enthusiasm for artificial intelligence technology continues to grow, despite warnings of a potential bubble.Conversely, GameStop and AMC Entertainment saw significant declines, retracting some of their earlier gains from the week. GameStop plummeted by 19.7%, reducing its weekly gain to 27.2%, after forecasting a loss of up to $37 million for the three months ending May 4. The company also announced plans to potentially sell up to 45 million shares to raise capital.Global indices reached new heights earlier this week due to optimism about potential interest rate cuts in the U.S. and other regions, driven by lower inflation. However, European markets faced profit-taking on Friday.""One day stock markets are making record highs and banking on rate cuts, the next stocks are giving back gains and rate cut expectations are being pared back,"" commented XTB analyst Kathleen Brooks.In Asia, Shanghai's market gained 1%, and Hong Kong continued its upward trend. Chinese property developers' stocks surged after Beijing announced a reduction in the minimum down payment rate for first-time homebuyers and hinted at potential government purchases of commercial real estate.China's real estate sector, a significant portion of its GDP, has faced considerable strain since 2020 due to tighter credit regulations aimed at reducing developer debt. This has led to declining prices and consumer hesitation in property investments, exerting pressure on the Chinese government to devise effective support measures.Recent announcements included broad measures to support the sector, as detailed in a meeting attended by regulators, top banks, local governments, and property market representatives. Specifics on the number of houses to be purchased were not provided.State media reported that the central bank and the National Financial Regulatory Administration would cut the minimum down payment rate for first-time homebuyers to 15%, one of the lowest rates in China’s history. The rate for second-home purchases will be reduced to 25%.Pantheon Macro economist Duncan Wrigley reacted cautiously, stating, ""China's new property support measures are helpful, but no magic bullet. The new measures are a step in the right direction and should speed up the bottoming out of upper-tier city housing markets, but the policy funding amount announced so far is disappointing and will probably need to be increased.""This week’s market movements reflect a complex global financial environment where regional developments and investor sentiments interact dynamically, highlighting the delicate balance policymakers must maintain to sustain economic growth.(With inputs from agencies)","The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed above 40,000 points for the first time. The S&P 500 also saw a slight increase, while the Nasdaq ended the day marginally negative. Reddit surged by 10% following the announcement of a partnership with OpenAI.

"If resolution takes long, recovery bound to drop",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/if-resolution-takes-long-recovery-bound-to-drop/articleshow/110217556.cms,"MUMBAI: There is a direct correlation between the length of the resolution process and the recovery rate , Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India said in a study.According to the study, lenders recover nearly half of their funds (49.2%) in insolvency cases resolved within 330 days. In cases that take longer, the recovery rate drops to 36%, further decreasing to 26% for cases that extend beyond 600 days.Out of the 947 cases analysed, a mere 14% were resolved within the stipulated timeline of 330 days. A significant 37% took between 330 to 600 days, and the remaining 49% stretched beyond 600 days.These delays - often triggered by litigations from multiple stakeholders with conflicting interests - not only erode the value of already distressed corporate defaulter, but also significantly reduce the recovery value to creditors , as pointed out by IBBI chairperson Ravi Mital in the board's newsletter.According to IBBI, 269 resolutions were approved in FY24 - a 42% increase over the 189 resolutions in FY23. The ratio of cases resolved to liquidation of cases improved from 0.46 in FY23 to 0.61 in FY24. While this is the highest-ever in any year since the inception of the IBC, the amount realised has declined. In FY24, the amount realised under cases resolved stood at Rs 48,000 crore as compared to Rs 55,000 crore in FY23.The ratio of recovery to admitted claims also dropped to 27% from 36% last year. While the IBC saw 200 admitted cases with claims of over Rs 1,000 crore, total assets in these claims stood at Rs 44,000 crore against admitted claims of Rs 8.8 lakh crore. This means that there were only 5% assets on ground.According to Mital, IBC's objective extends beyond the mere recovery of creditors. ""It is fundamentally geared toward the preservation of business. By prioritising resolution over liquidation, the IBC endeavours to safeguard the economic fabric by ensuring the survival and sustainability of the financially distressed entities,"" he said.

The finance minister set the stage for a ""Viksit Bharat by 2047"", on the core principles of ‘Sabka Saath’, ‘Sabka Vikas’, ‘Sabka Vishwas’, with ‘Sabka Prayas’ being added as a new theme in the interim Budget.This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data i.e., farmer welfare and N for Nari utthan i.e., support for women entrepreneurs.These form the pillars of a comprehensive inclusive development. The Government's commitment to sustainable development under the strategy for Amrit Kaal includes achieving 'Net Zero' by 2070, rooftop solarization for one crore households and robust health initiatives.The Indian economy's resilience takes center stage amidst positive indicators of declining current account deficit as a percentage of GDP, falling unemployment rates, and a notable rise in digital transactions. These statistics affirm the robustness of the economy, showcasing a trajectory of growth and stability.The achievements in taxation reforms are nothing short of remarkable, with direct tax collections more than trebling in the last decade, the number of tax return filers increasing by 2.4 times, average processing time of tax returns plummeting from 93 days in FY 2013-14 to an impressive 10 days in FY 2023-24, resulting in issuance of quick refunds. These are the results of consistent progressive measures thus obviating the need for, and rightly avoiding, any last-minute populist measures.No change in existing tax rates, both for direct and indirect taxes, is a good indicator of stability and predictability for investors and taxpayers.A welcome move to waive outstanding tax demands that are minor, disputed, and unreconciled. This involves the withdrawal of outstanding direct tax demands up to Rs. 25,000 pertaining to the period up to FY 2009-10 and up to Rs.10,000 for FY 2010-11 to 2014-15.The Government's commitment to fostering a business-friendly environment is evident in its intent to extend specific tax benefits for start-ups, investments by sovereign wealth funds/ pension funds, and certain IFSC units. The extension has been made now until March 31, 2025. This might help in creating a conducive landscape for business.To align with the CBDT notification issued earlier, the provisions relating to tax collection at source concerning remittances under the Liberalized Remittance Scheme have now been formally incorporated in the Finance Bill, 2024, setting the rate at 20% for amounts exceeding Rs. 7 lakhs in a financial year.The Finance Bill, 2024 proposes an extension of the time limit for introducing the faceless scheme by the Central Government for transfer pricing proceedings, DRP Proceedings, and ITAT Proceedings, up to March 31, 2025.The interim Budget 2024 may not have proposed significant tax announcements, but it very well positioned the prelude to the full budget post the upcoming elections. Considering the potential impact on the population across the four pillars of GYAN, a sizable portion of India stands to be covered. The interim Budget’s focus on the tax front resembles a report card, highlighting the maturity achieved by our tax system. The enhancement of taxpayer services was emphasized as a key priority.","This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data and N for Nari utthan.

Interim Budget for a Viksit Bharat: It’s for everyone and all,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/interim-budget-for-a-viksit-bharat-its-for-everyone-and-all/articleshow/107497439.cms,"By Akhilesh Tuteja

The Finance Minister on February 01, 2024, delivered a truly innovative interim budget. At first glance, it did not seem like an interim budget but looked more like the budget to drive further growth and a continuum of inclusive growth-oriented investments.At the outset, this budget brings a wonderful balance between fiscal prudence and continued investment for growth.It's not easy to continue the glide path of reducing the fiscal deficit and continuing to make significant investments in all areas including infrastructure, R&D, energy transition, technology, skilling, and social welfare. The surprising reduction in fiscal deficit of 5.8% as against the budgeted 5.9% for FY24 and the projection of 5.1% in FY25 with a clear focus on increasing investments was a huge positive.This was a budget for everyone and all because it caters to every part of the Indian economy and society. The FM has carefully catered to the investment needs of various sectors. The continued focus on youth, impoverished, women and farmers to increase their involvement and contribution to economic growth is evident. By committing an 11.1% increase in capital expenditure to 11,11,111 lakh crore, the FM has clearly brought every single 1 in this growth journey.What was very impressive was the inclusion strategy of the government. The focus on women's empowerment for the past few years is unprecedented, which is reflected in the inclusion of women in the workforce moving from 23.3% to 37% in the last five years. The thirty crore Mudra Yojna loans to women entrepreneurs were a great boost to the Nari Shakti initiative. We already have over 10 million Lakhpati Didis and what is truly evident is like a corporate CFO, the FM has revised the earlier target of 20 million Lakhpati Didis to 30 million. The government also plans to invest in initiatives to encourage young girls between the ages of 9 and 14 to undertake the vaccination for cervical cancer which is again a great boost to Nari Shakti.A lot needs to be done to bring more women into all parts of economic growth but the journey so far and the vision of the future is truly inspiring.While India continues on its technological prowess and makes its mark in new technologies like Artificial Intelligence, we need a multi-pronged strategy to harness the power of AI. We need a clear focus on building AI systems in India so that we not only emerge as a global leader in this new era but can build models, which are specific to India that will benefit Indians. At the same time, we need a very wide coverage program to build skills to leverage AI to its fullest potential. The biggest contribution we can make to the inclusion of youth in the economic development of the country is by skilling them in new skill areas. In the last few years, the Skill India Mission has trained 14 million youth, reskilled over 5 million youth and established a staggering 3,000 new ITIs. The future of any country will depend as much on capital investments as on skill investments.The focus on agricultural development and support to the farmer continues through direct financial assistance to farmers. The farmers have benefited by getting crop insurance through PM Fasal Bima Yojana. It's not just the farmers, the PM-SVANidhi provides credit assistance to a large number of street vendors.The last few years have seen the journey of affordable housing through Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY). There is a slight increase in allocation to launch a scheme for encouraging the middle class to build or buy new homes. This investment will likely propel a wider economic development and increase employment.India has seen a tremendous rise in entrepreneurship in the last few years. In order to continue the journey and promote new startups, the government proposes to extend certain tax benefits, which are expiring from March 2024 to March 2025. The MSMEs have not been left behind. With a proposal to provide timely finances to such enterprises, the government has paved the way for their growth, so they can look to compete globally.All in all, it’s a truly inclusive budget with a clear focus on development not just by giving away freebies but enabling the people to participate in the economic development activity. While the FM calls the comprehensive GDP - Governance, Development & Performance – to me, this budget is inclusive of another GDP – gender, demography, and professions.","Akhilesh Tuteja is Partner and Head, Clients and Markets, KPMG in India.

‘Enough domestic sources of demand to counter drag from external sector’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/enough-domestic-sources-of-demand-to-counter-drag-from-external-sector/articleshow/107372012.cms,"Do you think the

creates room for lower interest rates?

One of the issues that the Budget has flagged is the demographic challenge and opportunity and the societal change that is taking place. How do you view this?

Niti Aayog is working on the Viksit Bharat roadmap. What will be the focus areas?

You are as much a representative of the Centre as well as the states. Is it time to revisit the entire formula for transfers to states particularly on the issue of cesses and surcharges?

Suman Bery , who heads Niti Aayog , the govt think tank, is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China, which he says is also an opportunity for India. The economist is confident that Indian states remain resilient. Excerpts of the interview with TOI.The finance ministry expects the economy to grow 7% next year.Given the global situation, how do you see the prospects?The belief in the finance ministry is that we have a possible drag coming from the external sector but that we have other sources. We have enough domestic sources of demand. One has to applaud the political and economic judgment of FM in deciding that it was appropriate to pursue the path of fiscal consolidation. There is transparency. What this actually reflects is responsible economic management, which is one reason we are where we are. Second, it also creates a buffer so that there is policy space if we do encounter headwinds.That’s the hope and expectation. We have an independent central bank and an inflation targeting central bank, so it is up to the monetary policy committee to take a call through the monetary policy committee on the repo rate .The PM has said that when India grows its states grow. India is a composite of 37 states and UTs. They are each at very different points in their demographic transition. There are some states where the net replacement rate is down to 1%, like Kerala . There are others, particularly UP and Bihar, which are in their earliest stage of demographic transition and each one of these states is the size of a large European country. There are two implications of that — one is internal labour mobility and it will become an even larger part of our growth model. The govt has taken several steps to create a unified market. Our main endowment is our human capital and that has to be equipped to participate in global exchange in many ways. We know from China, Japan that the demographic dividend partly depends on markets and on human capital. But the golden period is fairly short lived, about 15 years, when the so called dependency ratio declines. The other big opportunity the PM has been highlighting is bringing women much more into the active labour force.When Niti was set up there was the idea of a three-year vision and a seven-year strategy paper. The reality is that schemes of govt tend to be aligned with the award of the Finance Commission . There are various established building blocks or hand holds which are already a matter of govt policy. The PM is much more interested in a national debate on what it means to be a Viksit Bharat or modern society. We have a collective goal and it is for the democratic polity to define what that goal should be. Its emphatically not for a super mandarin bureaucracy. It is not going to be Lee Kwan Yew’s Singapore led from the top.It’s entirely a finance ministry matter but I would be lying if I didn’t say when I visit certain states there is this complaint. A big frontier would be resource mobilisation at the state level. Second is going to be rationalisation of subsidies not only at the Union level, but also at the state level. All chief ministers sit on my governing council. When they convene as the governing council, I see them in their role as development practitioners. The world is beginning to appreciate quite how much institutional and political maturity India attained in our 75 years and the most fundamental dimension of a democracy, we have orderly transfers of power. There are enough buffers to ensure that what happens in state finances is unlikely to create macro instability. Those risks are well contained by our Constitution. The chief ministers know that they are going to be judged by development outcomes and so you can have the sugar rush of changing of pension plans or various handouts but if the cupboard is bare you are not going to be able to deliver.","Suman Bery is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China.

Government's Marathon to 2047: Emphasis on Fiscal Prudence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/governments-marathon-to-2047-emphasis-on-fiscal-prudence/articleshow/107371788.cms,"What was the thinking behind keeping the vote on account absolutely straight?

So is it the idea to keep the Budget completely transparent?

The capex has risen 11.1% and there is an emphasis on infrastructure spending. But there is also the hope that the private sector will now take over and start capital spending. Given the geopolitical situation, how confident is the govt that it will pan out as planned?

Finance secretary T V Somanathan, in an interview with TOI, says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047 . Excerpts:If you see the Budget speech you will see the emphasis on 2047. The govt has set its sight on running that marathon.Running to 2047 is a marathon , it’s not a sprint. If you are going to run a marathon, you need to be in good shape and you can’t have short-term stimulants or something that will get you some yards and then it’s done.The whole focus is on making India a developed country by 2047, for which a healthy present and a strong fiscal position is an important concomitant. Some purely short term measures don’t really fit into that picture. It’s a consistent picture: focus on the long term for which you need to build strength in the short term and that needs to be done by prudence in fiscal policy and by not doing things which can detract you from that path. Not doing the wrong thing is more important than appearing to do things.The idea is that govt finances may be good, bad or indifferent depending on the times, depending on the circumstances, depending on the policies. But what is the position should be reflected as reasonably and accurately as possible. That is an emphasis. As regards the Finance Commission, again the terms of reference that have been given to them are the terms in the Constitution.What is the means by which the devolution should be done is a matter they have full discretion. They can actually take all kinds of factors into account and in a sense we felt this time based on my review of the previous commissions that the right expression would be less is more. The shorter, less prescriptive terms of reference gives full scope for all stakeholders including state govts to express their viewpoints and for the commission to take a balanced view of the different perspectives and then come to its award. Ultimately the award of the Finance Commission is about devolution and grant for which full scope has now been given to them.n There are incipient signs of private capital expenditure accelerating. There are some surveys I have seen done by some of the chambers industry, which show high levels of investment. The PMI, which is a sort of leading indicator, is also looking pretty healthy. Capacity utilisation is one reason that private sector capital expenditure doesn’t immediately pick up when the economy starts accelerating because there is surplus capacity.But increasingly I get the sense that many industries are beginning to reach levels where they have to add capacity. When that happens capital investment will happen. Another pointer also mentioned in the Budget speech you may notice that our airlines have placed large orders for planes — that is capital expenditure.When you import 1,000 aircraft, it’s just not 1,000 aircraft, there are concomitant additions to ground handling facilities, you need airports to expand, you need to employ people to do that. That means a lot of jobs. The aircraft is capital but then look at the effect it is going to have on skilled jobs. So capital expenditure is happening. I am fairly confident that we will have decent capital expenditure in the year to come and that will become a new source of acceleration.",Finance secretary T V Somanathan says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047.

What is the Section 80C limit for tax deduction for FY 2024-25 after Interim Budget 2024?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/income-tax-budget-2024-2024-2025-section-80c-limit-epf-ppf-elss-nsc/articleshow/107353021.cms,"ALSO READ |

Income Tax Changes Budget 2024 : In the recent Budget 2024 speech, the Finance Minister kept the Section 80C tax deduction limit unchanged. The maximum limit for claiming tax benefits under Section 80C remains at Rs 1.5 lakh for the current fiscal year 2023-24 and will stay the same for individuals looking to save on taxes through Section 80C investments in the upcoming fiscal year 2024-25.Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions. Individuals can reduce their gross taxable income by up to Rs 1.5 lakh per financial year by engaging in these specific investments or expenditures.You can save on taxes through Section 80C by investing in things like Employees' Provident Fund (EPF), Public Provident Fund (PPF), Equity Linked Saving Scheme (ELSS) mutual funds, National Savings Certificate (NSC), and 5-year tax-saving fixed deposits with banks or post offices. Additionally, paying life insurance policy premiums also qualifies for tax benefits under Section 80C.It is important to note that each eligible investment comes with its specific maximum limit, rate of return, liquidity, and taxation rules for the earned returns, states ET in a report. For instance, the most you can invest in PPF in a financial year is Rs 1.5 lakh. Meanwhile, there's no limit on the amount you can invest in ELSS mutual funds, but the Section 80C deduction is capped at Rs 1.5 lakh.If individuals can't make specific investments, they can still get deductions under Section 80C from their gross taxable income through certain expenses. These expenses include repaying the principal amount of a home loan, tuition fees for children, payment of stamp duty, registration fees, and other costs related to buying a house.Since the financial year 2020-21, individuals without any business income must annually choose between the old and new tax regimes. As of the fiscal year 2023-24, the new tax regime is the default option. Consequently, individuals seeking tax deductions under Section 80C must opt for the old tax regime since this deduction isn't available in the new tax regime. It's crucial for taxpayers to be aware of these rules to make informed decisions about their tax planning and investment strategies.","Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget which is an interim budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year. The budget talks about inclusive development both, social and geographical, especially for youth, women, farmers, and the poor. Continued focus on improving logistics through infrastructure spend on roads, rail, airports, ports increases productivity for companies and citizens alike.To make ‘Viksit Bharat’ by 2047, the government’s focus is on improving and empowering people’s capabilities through various skilling initiatives. It is encouraging to see that Skill India Mission has succeeded in training more than 1.4 crore youth and upskilling and reskilling 54 lakh youth. I am particularly happy to see the continued focus on youth and women entrepreneurship and the announcement of a new fund which will give interest free 50 year loans for startups will provide a domestic fillip to startups supplementing venture capital we have traditionally relied on from abroad.PM Mudra Yojana has sanctioned 43 crore loans aggregating to 22.5 lakh crore to youth entrepreneurs and thirty crore Mudra Yojana loans to women entrepreneurs. There are several other schemes like Fund of Funds, Start-Up India, and Start-Up Credit Guarantee schemes that are assisting our youth. Further, the extension of tax benefits to Start-ups and investments made by sovereign wealth funds/pension funds, till 31st March 2025 depicts the government’s effort to support the startup eco- system.This aligns quite well with India Sanitation Coalition’s efforts to give impetus to the start-up world. Over the past 7 editions of our ISC-FICCI Sanitation Awards, we have recognized and promoted several start-ups in the sanitation space, many of whom are successful businesses now!While the finance minister did not provide detailed information on Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH), the budget allocation sees a slight increase in spend demonstrating continued focus on this highly successful program. The acknowledgement that the private sector has increasingly played a substantial role in addressing WASH issues in both urban and rural areas, with numerous projects underway through Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs), highlights the government's commitment to addressing challenges in this sector.A perfect example is the LightHouse Initiative initiated by the Department of Drinking Water along with the India Sanitation Coalition (ISC) by partnering with major corporates across India to develop model villages in Solid and Liquid Waste Management (SLWM) under SBM-Grameen. From this budget, there is an expectation that the government will persist in prioritizing Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) as the path toward achieving the country's Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6). Additionally, it is hoped that the government will uphold its commitment to making necessary infrastructural investments for SLWM.The budget speech rightly celebrates the fact that we have 83 lakh SHGs and 9 crore women beneficiaries. The microfinance movement in the country and the possibility of empowering women members of SHGs through livelihood skilling is a key to bringing women into mainstream economic advancement.The focus on green growth, rooftop solar, wind, biomass, e-vehicles all help with our green energy thrust. The tourism sector was mentioned and could be a huge job provider for youth and women.Guided by the principle ‘Reform, Perform, and Transform’, the budget emphasizes efficient implementation of various policies by improving coordination with states and relevant stakeholders. This is critical both for infra spend and social programsIt is noteworthy that ISC’s Climate Resilient Coastal Cities project which is being implemented in PPP (Public-Private Partnership) mode in four coastal states of Karnataka, Gujarat, Goa and Maharashtra is congruent with the government’s priority of promoting climate-resilient activities for the blue economy 2.0, a scheme for restoration and adaptation measures, and coastal aquaculture.The budget also focuses on the Aspirational districts program where assistance will be given to the states for faster development of aspirational districts and blocks, including the generation of ample economic opportunities. This is again very crucial as it has a huge potential to transform the landscape of our country while making sure no -one is left behind.Overall, this budget has embraced economic strategies and develops the building blocks that nurture and uphold growth, promote inclusive and sustainable development, and enhance productivity.","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year.

An earlier state department statement said the scheme had generated at least $6.8 million for North Korea. It said the North Koreans involved were linked to North Korea's munitions industry department, which oversees development of the country's ballistic missiles, weapons production, and research and development programmes.An indictment filed in federal court in Washington last week and unsealed on Thursday said charges had been filed against Christina Marie Chapman, 49, of Litchfield Park, Arizona; Ukrainian Oleksandr Didenko, 27, of Kyiv; and three other foreign nationals. A justice department statement said Chapman was arrested Wednesday, while Didenko was arrested on May 7 by Poland at the request of US, which is seeking his extradition.The head of the justice department's criminal division, Nicole Argentieri, said the alleged crimes ""benefited the North Korean govt, giving it a revenue stream and, in some instances, proprietary information stolen by the co-conspirators."" The charges ""should be a wakeup call for American companies and govt agencies that employ remote IT workers,"" she said in the statement.The DoJ said Didenko was accused of creating fake accounts at US IT job search platforms, selling them to overseas IT workers, some of whom he believed were North Korean. It said overseas IT workers using Didenko's services were also working with Chapman. Didenko's online domain, upworksell.com, was seized Thursday by the justice department, the statement said. The DoJ statement said the FBI executed search warrants for US-based ""laptop farms"" - residences that hosted multiple laptops for overseas IT workers. It said that through these farms, including one Chapman hosted from her home, US-based facilitators logged onto US firm computer networks and allowed the overseas IT workers to remotely access the laptops, using US IP addresses to make it appear they were in the US.North Korea is under UN sanctions aimed at cutting funding for its missile and nuclear weapons programmes and experts say it has sought to generate income illicitly.","US prosecutors say North Korea-linked IT workers posing as Americans to obtain remote-work jobs at hundreds of US companies.

L’Oreal SA heiress Francoise Bettencourt Meyers, Dell Technologies Inc founder Michael Dell and Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim all initially reached the threshold in the past five months and some have fluctuated around that level, crossing it multiple times.Bettencourt Meyers became the first woman to amass a 12-figure fortune in December after shares of the luxury cosmetics company posted their best year since 1998.

Warren Buffett's latest bet: Berkshire reveals $6.7 billion investment in insurance giant,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/warren-buffetts-latest-bet-berkshire-reveals-6-7-billion-investment-in-insurance-giant/articleshow/110175706.cms,"NEW DELHI: Legendary investor Warren Buffett ’s Berkshire Hathaway has unveiled a significant investment in the insurance giant Chubb , marking a major move that was kept confidential until now. The stake, amounting to nearly 26 million shares, was disclosed in a recent Securities and Exchange Commission filing, representing a value of approximately $6.7 billion.This investment in Chubb highlights Buffett's ongoing strategy of investing heavily in financial firms. Berkshire Hathaway, under Buffett's leadership, has historically favored the insurance sector, owning companies such as Geico, National Indemnity, and General Re.Berkshire owns many other companies — including BNSF railroad, a number of utilities and an assortment of manufacturing and retail companies — but insurers, like Geico and General Reinsurance, have always been at the core of the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate. So it makes sense that another insurer like Zurich-based Chubb might appeal to Buffett.CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert said in a note to investors that Chubb is now one of the 10 biggest holdings in Berkshire's portfolio. “We can’t speculate whether Berkshire would pursue an outright acquisition of CB, but we note their business mixes are highly complementary,"" Seifert wrote.Berkshire had previously requested ""confidential treatment"" from the SEC to keep the buildup of this position private. The disclosure of this substantial investment comes after Chubb recently made headlines for underwriting a nearly $92 million appeal bond for President Donald Trump in the defamation lawsuit filed by E Jean Carroll.Following the revelation of Berkshire's new stake, Chubb's stock experienced an 8% surge in after-hours trading, reflecting investor confidence boosted by Buffett’s involvement.This move is part of a broader trend where Berkshire Hathaway has been concentrating its investments in financial entities, including Ally Financial, American Express, and Bank of America, while reducing stakes in consumer products. Notably, Buffett’s firm scaled back its holdings in Apple and HP significantly in recent months.Berkshire sold off a little over 116 million Apple shares in the quarter — accounting for about 13% of its stake — to trim its biggest single investment. But it still holds nearly 790 million Apple shares, and Buffett told shareholders that he expected the iPhone maker to remain a long-term holding.The investment community closely watches Buffett's investment choices, often emulating his strategies, which underscores the significant market impact of his decisions.(With inputs from agencies)","Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway has unveiled a significant investment in the insurance giant Chubb.

As Bitcoin experiences a sharp increase, reaching close to $63,000, and Cardano stirs the market with news of a potential Gemini listing, BlockDAG 's latest dashboard update reveals significant whale transactions, signalling robust market dynamics and potential investment opportunities. This update is part of BlockDAG's commitment to enhancing user engagement and transparency in the cryptocurrency sector .Bitcoin's price has rallied impressively, testing the pivotal 50-day Moving Average (MA) resistance. If it breaks above this level, particularly past the recent swing high, it could signal a strong bullish trend. Conversely, failure to surpass this barrier might result in Bitcoin continuing to oscillate around this critical junction, shaped by intersecting trend lines from recent highs and lows.The cryptocurrency community is abuzz with speculation that Cardano (ADA) might soon be listed on the Gemini exchange, sparked by a recent article from one of the founders.

"Amid US-China tensions, Microsoft asks over 700 China-based staff to relocate",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/amid-us-china-tensions-microsoft-asks-over-700-china-based-staff-to-relocate/articleshow/110165158.cms,"NEW DELHI: Microsoft has asked over 700-800 its employees based in China to consider exploring the possibility of relocating to other countries, the company said amid escalating tensions between the United States and China, particularly concerning advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence and semiconductors.According to a report by the Wall Street Journal, Microsoft has extended this request to approximately 700 to 800 employees who are engaged in machine learning and other cloud computing-related work.In response to an inquiry from Reuters, a Microsoft spokesperson stated via email, ""Providing internal opportunities is a regular part of managing our global business. As part of this process, we shared an optional internal transfer opportunity with a subset of employees."" However, the spokesperson refrained from specifying the exact number of employees who received this request.The spokesperson emphasized that Microsoft remains dedicated to its operations in China and will continue to maintain a presence there, as well as in other markets worldwide.The Wall Street Journal, citing individuals familiar with the matter, reported that earlier in the week, the employees, primarily Chinese nationals working as engineers, were presented with the option to relocate to the United States, Ireland, Australia, or New Zealand.This development occurs against the backdrop of deteriorating US-China relations, as the administration of President Joe Biden has increased tariffs on various Chinese imports, including electric vehicle batteries, computer chips, and medical products. Reuters previously reported this month that the US Commerce Department is contemplating a new regulatory initiative aimed at restricting the export of proprietary or closed-source AI models, where the software and training data are kept confidential.(With agency inputs)","Microsoft has asked over 700-800 its employees based in China to consider exploring the possibility of relocating to other countries.

"Dow, S&P 500, Nasdaq end at records as US inflation cools",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/dow-sp-500-nasdaq-end-at-records-as-us-inflation-cools/articleshow/110162061.cms,"Wall Street surged to new heights on Wednesday following encouraging signs of easing inflation, which has sparked anticipation of upcoming interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve . The release of US consumer price data for April showed a slight moderation in inflation rates, sending the three major stock indices to record levels.The Dow Jones Industrial Average soared by 0.9 percent, reaching 39,908.00 and nearing the monumental 40,000 mark.The S&P 500 increased by 1.2 percent to 5,308.15, and the Nasdaq Composite grew by 1.4 percent, ending the day at 16,742.39, marking consecutive record closes.This optimism was partly due to the monthly consumer price index indicating an annual inflation rate of 3.4 percent for April, a slight decrease from 3.5 percent in March. ""The reports together point to a cooling of inflation and economic growth, as well as an increase in the likelihood that the Fed will begin its rate-cutting cycle later this year,"" commented Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research.Despite robust market performances, US retail sales in April were stagnant, missing the anticipated 0.4 percent growth. This could signal a deceleration in consumer spending, potentially impacting economic stability.In the bond market, the easing of Treasury yields alleviated some pressure, enhancing the appeal of stocks, especially those likely to benefit from lower interest rates. Homebuilders like Lennar, DR Horton, and PulteGroup all saw significant gains, driven by hopes that rate cuts could lower mortgage costs.Tech stocks also enjoyed a boost, with Nvidia rising by 3.6 percent, significantly contributing to the S&P 500's gains. Utility and real estate sectors likewise performed well, as lower bond yields made their dividends more attractive.Market sentiment was influenced by various corporate performances and economic indicators. Dell Technologies saw an 11.2 percent jump after an optimistic analyst upgrade from Morgan Stanley, while Boeing faced a 2.1 percent drop amid legal troubles. The fluctuating fortunes of 'meme stocks' such as GameStop and AMC Entertainment highlighted the volatile nature of these investments, with significant losses following recent gains.As traders now place a nearly 95 percent probability on the Fed cutting rates at least once this year, the market remains sensitive to economic signals and Federal Reserve policies. This delicate balance of slowing the economy to manage inflation without triggering a recession continues to be a central theme in market dynamics.(With inputs from agencies)","The Dow Jones Industrial Average soared by 0.9 percent, reaching 39,908.00 and nearing the monumental 40,000 mark.

OpenAI's chief scientist and co-founder is leaving the company,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/openais-chief-scientist-and-co-founder-is-leaving-the-company/articleshow/110130685.cms,"SAN FRANCISCO: Ilya Sutskever , the OpenAI co-founder and chief scientist who in November joined three other board members to force out Sam Altman , the company's high-profile CEO, before saying he regretted the move, is leaving the San Francisco artificial intelligence company.Sutskever's departure, which the company announced in a blog post Tuesday, closes another chapter in a story that stunned Silicon Valley and that raised questions about whether Altman and his company were prepared to lead the tech industry into the age of AI.After returning to OpenAI just five days after he was ousted, Altman reasserted his control and continued its push toward increasingly powerful technologies that worried some of his critics. Sutskever remained an OpenAI employee, but he never returned to work.""This is an emotional day for all of us,"" Altman said in an interview. ""OpenAI would not exist without him and certainly was shaped by him.""In a statement, Sutskever said: ""I have made the decision to leave OpenAI. The company's trajectory has been nothing short of miraculous, and I'm confident that OpenAI will build A.G.I. that is both safe and beneficial."" AGI, or artificial general intelligence, is an as-yet-unbuilt technology that can do anything the brain can do.Sutskever, 38, added that he was starting a new project, but did not elaborate.A key OpenAI researcher, Jakub Pachocki, will replace Sutskever as chief scientist at the company, which is valued at more than $80 billion, according to a recent fundraising deal.On Monday, OpenAI unveiled a new version of its ChatGPT chatbot that can receive and respond to voice commands, images and videos, joining tech giants including Google and Apple in a race toward a new kind of talking digital assistant.Founded in 2015 by Altman, Elon Musk and several young researchers, including Sutskever, OpenAI has long been at the forefront of AI research. Sutskever's involvement provided the company with instant credibility. As a graduate student at the University of Toronto, he had been part of an AI breakthrough involving neural networks -- the technology that has driven the field's progress over the past decade.In late 2022, OpenAI wowed the world with the release of ChatGPT, an online chatbot that could answer questions, write poetry, generate computer code and chat a lot like people. The tech industry quickly embraced what is called generative artificial intelligence -- technologies that can generate text, images and other media on their own.The result of more than a decade of research inside companies like OpenAI and Google, generative AI is poised to remake everything from email programs to internet search engines and digital assistants.Altman became a spokesperson for the shift toward generative AI, testifying before Congress and meeting with lawmakers, regulators and investors around the world. In November, OpenAI's board of directors unexpectedly ousted him, saying he could no longer be trusted with the company's plan to eventually create artificial general intelligence.The OpenAI board had six people: three founders and three independent members. Sutskever voted with the three outsiders to remove Altman as CEO and chair of the board, saying -- without providing specifics -- that Altman had not been ""consistently candid in his communications.""Greg Brockman, OpenAI's chief operating officer and another co-founder, resigned from the company in protest. So did Pachocki.Days later, as hundreds of OpenAI employees threatened to quit, Sutskever said he regretted his decision to remove Altman and effectively stepped down from the board, leaving three independent members in opposition to Altman.Altman returned as CEO after he and the board agreed to replace two members with Bret Taylor, a former Salesforce executive, and Lawrence Summers, a former U.S. Treasury secretary. Altman regained his board seat several months later, as the board expanded to seven people.Last year, Sutskever helped create a Super Alignment team inside OpenAI to explore ways of ensuring that future versions of the technology would not do harm. Like others in the field, he had grown increasingly concerned that AI could become dangerous and perhaps even destroy humanity.Jan Leike, who ran the Super Alignment team alongside Sutskever, has also resigned from OpenAI. His role will be taken by John Schulman , another company co-founder.In the weeks leading up to Altman's ouster, Pachocki, who helped oversee the creation of GPT-4, the technology at the heart of ChatGPT, was promoted to director of research at the company. After occupying a position below Sutskever, he was elevated to a position alongside him, two people familiar with the moves said.After Altman was reinstated, Sutskever did not return to work. Altman indicated that he was hoping to negotiate his return, but ultimately that was not possible.Pachocki has effectively served as chief scientist since November. After Sutskever recruited him and others to join OpenAI, he was among the key researchers on several of the company's most important projects, including, most notably, GPT-4.""I am grateful to Ilya,"" Pachocki said in an interview. ""We have different and in many ways complementary styles of leadership.""Altman said he talked with Sutskever on Tuesday. ""He has pushed us -- and will continue to push us -- to, as he says, feel the AGI,"" Altman said.","Ilya Sutskever, a co-founder and chief scientist at OpenAI, is leaving the company.

Fed's Powell downplays potential for a rate hike despite higher price pressures,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/feds-powell-downplays-potential-for-a-rate-hike-despite-higher-price-pressures/articleshow/110125324.cms,"WASHINGTON: Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday that the central bank is unlikely to raise its key interest rate in response to signs of stubborn inflation and underscored his view that price increases would soon start to cool again.Yet Powell, during a panel discussion in Amsterdam, said his confidence that inflation will ease ""is not as high as it was"" because price increases have been persistently hot in the first three months of this year.Powell stressed that the Fed's preferred approach was to keep its benchmark rate at its current two-decade peak rather than increase it.""I don't think that it's likely, based on the data that we have, that the next move that we make would be a rate hike ,"" Powell said. ""I think it's more likely that we'll be at a place where we hold the policy rate where it is.""Financial markets and economists have been hoping for signs that one or two Fed rate cuts might be coming this year, given that inflation is down sharply from its high in 2022. But with price pressures still elevated, Powell and other Fed officials have signaled that no rate cut is likely anytime soon.Powell spoke hours after a report on U.S. producer prices showed that wholesale inflation picked up in April. On Wednesday, the government will issue the latest monthly report on consumer inflation, which is expected to show that price growth cooled a bit last month.In his remarks Tuesday, Powell downplayed the wholesale price report, which also showed that some costs cooled last month, including for airfares, hospital visits and car insurance.""I wouldn't call it hot,"" he said of the wholesale inflation data. ""I would call it sort of mixed.""Economists are divided over whether the high inflation figures this year reflect a re-acceleration in price growth or are largely echoes of pandemic distortions. Auto insurance, for example, has soared 22% from a year ago, but that surge may reflect factors specific to the auto industry: New car prices jumped during the pandemic, and insurance companies are now seeking to offset the higher repair and replacement costs by raising their premiums.Other economists point to consistent consumer spending on restaurant meals, travel and entertainment, categories where in some cases price increases have also been elevated, possibly reflecting strong demand.Powell said that upcoming inflation reports will reveal whether such factors are keeping inflation high or whether inflation will soon fall back to the Fed's 2% target, as he said he expects. Inflation, which peaked at 9.1% in the summer of 2022, is forecast to slow to 3.4% in Wednesday's latest report.The Fed chair noted that rising rents are one key factor keeping inflation high. He called that ""a bit of a puzzle"" because measures of new apartment leases show new rents barely increasing. Such weaker data has apparently yet to flow into the government's measures, which cover all rents, including for tenants who renew their leases. Though rents are still growing faster for tenants who renew leases, Powell said the government's measures should eventually show rent growth easing.The Fed chair also acknowledged that the economy ""is different this time"" because so many Americans refinanced their mortgages at very low rates before the Fed began raising borrowing costs in March 2022. Many large businesses also locked in low rates at that time.""It may be,"" he said, that the Fed's rate policy ""is hitting the economy not quite as strongly as it would have if those two things were not the case.""Last week, Fed officials underscored that they were prepared to leave their key interest rate at 5.3%, the highest level in 23 years, as long as needed quell inflation.","Jerome Powell says the Fed's preferred approach is to keep its benchmark rate at its current two-decade peak. Powell spoke hours after a report on U.S. producer prices showed that wholesale inflation picked up in April.
