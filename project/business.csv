This means the $1.7-trillion fund - the world's largest sovereign wealth fund by assets under management - will sell its remaining stake in Adani Ports.The Norwegian pension fund invests in equities and bonds across most countries and markets.In a statement, Norges Bank said it has decided to exclude Adani Ports due to ""unacceptable risk that the company contributes to serious violations of individuals' rights in situations of war or conflict"". The port operator, part of billionaire Gautam Adani's conglomerate, has been under its watch list since March 2022 and that ""observation now ends given the exclusion decision"".Adani Ports didn't respond to TOI's requests for comments on its exclusion from the Norwegian pension fund's portfolio. Norges Bank said its decision to exclude Adani Ports from the fund's portfolio was based on recommendations from Council On Ethics . COE is an independent body that makes recommendations to Norges Bank to either exclude companies from the pension fund or place them under observation. In a statement, the COE said that Adani Ports was under observation ""due to its business association with the armed forces in Myanmar "", which in Feb 2021 staged a military coup.The Indian company was involved with a port terminal in Myanmar, incurring an investment of $150 million. In May 2023, the company disclosed that it sold the Myanmar port to Solar Energy. The COE noted that no information on the buyer is available, and Adani Ports has stated that it cannot share any such information on the grounds of confidentiality. Lack of information means that the COE cannot establish whether Adani Ports still has links to the enterprise concerned.""In a situation in which extremely serious norm violations are taking place, this constitutes an unacceptable risk that the government pension fund's investments in Adani Ports may breach its ethical guidelines"". Norges Bank didn't mention the quantum of stake the government pension fund holds in Adani Ports. The fund has been paring its exposure in Adani Ports over the last several quarters. In Feb 2023, it held 0.3% in Adani Ports. Besides Adani Ports, it held 0.14% in Adani Green and 0.17% in Adani Total Gas. ts latest holding in all the three Adani Group companies couldn't be ascertained.","Norges Bank, Norway's central bank, has decided to exclude Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone from its government pension fund over ethical concerns.

CEA: Are futures & options trading volumes sign of progress or worry?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/cea-are-futures-options-trading-volumes-sign-of-progress-or-worry/articleshow/110238672.cms,"NEW DELHI: A top finance ministry official on Saturday sounded caution about the large volumes on futures and options trading and said there is a need to ensure that the capital market grows in areas where the country's household savings can be used for productive purposes.""When we take pride in the fact that we have the world's largest trading volume for futures and options we need to ask ourselves, is that a sign of progress or a sign of concern?,"" V.Anantha Nageswaran, chief economic adviser in the finance ministry said at a conclave organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII).""Whenever financial sector development precedes national development the story hasn't ended well for other countries as well. The Asian crisis 1997-98 is a very important example,"" said Nageswaran.He said the ""sachetisation"" of futures and options is something that needs to be reconsidered because financial literacy that is required for trading stocks is very different for trading futures and options and many of the current people who are engaged in these markets do not understand them.""So to that extent the financial sector has this responsibility,"" said Nageswaran. Sachetisation refers to making financial products available in manageable portions to minimise risk. Futures and options is a complex trading in stock derivatives and carries significant risks and the explosion of volumes in retail F&O has emerged as a concern for authorities.Earlier this week, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had also expressed caution saying that an unchecked explosion in retail futures and options trading had the potential to create future challenges not just for markets but for investor sentiment and also for household finances. The FM had also said that household finances have made a generational shift and govt wants to safeguard and ensure that it is not going to be shattered.There has been a significant fall in net financial savings of households by over Rs 9 lakh crores between 2020-21 and 2022-23, latest data released by the ministry of statistics and programme implementation (MOSPI) showed.The gross financial savings of households was at 29.7 lakh crore while financial liabilities was estimated at Rs 15.6 lakh crore in 2022-23, according to the latest national account statistics released by MOSPI. Financial liabilities were at their highest level in 2022-23 since 2011-12 when it was at Rs 2.9 lakh crore.Savings in physical assets was at Rs 34.8 lakh crore in 2022-23 while in gold and silver ornaments it was at Rs 63.4 thousand crore in 2022-23-the highest since 2011-12 when it was at Rs 33.6 thousand crore.. Bank advances to households nearly doubled in three to Rs 11.88 lakh crore in 2022-23 rising from Rs 6.05 lakh crore in 2020-21 and Rs 7.69 lakh crore in 2021-22, the data showed.The investment in mutual funds by households grew by 20.6 times since 2011-12 and was estimated at Rs 1.8 lakh crore in 2022-23 from Rs 8,694 crore in 2011-12.","V.Anantha Nageswaran, chief economic adviser in the finance ministry said at a conclave organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry.

"N Vaghul, banker who built ICICI brand, dies at 88",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/n-vaghul-banker-who-built-icici-brand-dies-at-88/articleshow/110238867.cms,"Vaghul: The right man in the right job at the right time

Banking wasn't his first career choice. But N Vaghul , who passed away on Saturday - he was 88 - redefined the industry he joined after his plans to appear for civil service exams hit a roadblock.Survived by his wife, son and daughter, Vaghul breathed his last in Apollo hospital in Chennai, where he was admitted after a fall.Vaghul's most storied achievement, one which ensured his place in Indian banking history, was building the ICICI brand in finance .ICICI is today India's second biggest bank by m-cap, after HDFC. His five-decade-plus stint in the financial sector, which started when he cleared an exam for SBI probationary officer in 1957, was dotted with accomplishments.A recipient of the Padma Bhushan in 2009, Vaghul was the youngest bank chairman, leading Bank of India at the age of 44. He was also the youngest chairman of the Indian Banks Association.There was a point though when Vaghul left banking. He had risen up SBI's ranks, mentored by another veteran banker , SBI chairman R K Talwar. But those were the heydays of Indian socialism. Bureaucrats thought they knew how banks should be run. Vaghul left banking, unwilling to follow bureaucratic diktats. Unusually for a man who dealt with money, he spent much of his break from finance studying spirituality at Swami Chinmayananda's Ashram in Rishikesh. He also had a stint as director of the National Institute of Bank Management.The job he took when he rejoined banking was the one that came to define him, and change Indian banking. In 1985, he took over the reins of what was then the Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India (ICICI).ICICI was then a development finance institution, envisioned very much in pre-reforms mould. But India was already in churn. Vaghul's term saw India getting hit by the balance of payments crisis, and out of that crisis the birth of economic reforms. He was the right man in the right job at the right time. He helmed ICICI through those tumultuous years, merged ICICI with ICICI Bank, having foreseen that the sharp rise in interest rates in the 1990s would hit development finance institutions.To him goes the credit of building India's first credit rating agency, Crisil. He set up ICICI Securities as an independent investment bank. Under him, ICICI was the first brave few which ventured into new age banking.For most bankers, that would have been an achievement enough. But Vaghul was a pioneer in another, equally pathbreaking way. He broke the mould of stodgy recruitment practices that defined most of India Inc by, first, being a great talent spotter and, second, being a firm believer in a gender-neutral meritocracy. Vaghul's ICICI recruited and mentored women financiers at a time the money game was almost exclusively male. And it was Vaghul who headhunted K V Kamath from Asian Development Bank. Kamath, who went on to become a banking great himself, took ICICI to the next level as a liberalised India opened up markets and opportunities. Not just Kamath, many of India's financial sector leaders today - Sebi chief Madhabi Puri Buch, Multiples Asset founder Renuka Ramnath, Kalpana Morparia, who headed J P Morgan India for over a decade, Shikha Sharma, who led Axis Bank for nine years, and ICICI Bank chief Sandeep Bakhshi - were all spotted and mentored by Vaghul.Per Kamath, Vaghul gave a free hand to him but was always there as a leader, a friend, philosopher and guide. ""I have always looked up to Vaghul as my mentor,"" said Kamath. ""He brought this freshness of doing something different, something innovative and at scale, and drove its implementation. We quickly put in place a strategy function, thought of new business ideas, started recruitment at scale and built the foundation of this new ICICI,"" Kamath recalled.One of the many stories of Vaghul's unique leadership style was about him empowering young executives at ICICI. He allowed anyone, however junior, to bring a credit proposal to the top bank committee as long as they could defend it before the panel. Even now, few company heads across sectors would be willing to bypass hierarchy like this. That's what, those who worked with him say, made him an extraordinary leader.Tributes poured in for Vaghul on Saturday. RBI governor Shaktikanta Das described him as ""a visionary...(who) made huge contributions to India's financial sector"". ""Every interaction with him was refreshing,"" he said.Anand Mahindra, chairman, Mahindra & Mahindra, said Vaghul was a ""titan of Indian business"" and ""one of the most inspiring and generous"" persons he had ever met. Congress' Jairam Ramesh, describing Vaghul as ""one of India's most distinguished bankers"", recalled his ""wonderful sense of humour"".","Vaghul was the youngest bank chairman, leading Bank of India at the age of 44.

The finance minister set the stage for a ""Viksit Bharat by 2047"", on the core principles of ‘Sabka Saath’, ‘Sabka Vikas’, ‘Sabka Vishwas’, with ‘Sabka Prayas’ being added as a new theme in the interim Budget.This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data i.e., farmer welfare and N for Nari utthan i.e., support for women entrepreneurs.These form the pillars of a comprehensive inclusive development. The Government's commitment to sustainable development under the strategy for Amrit Kaal includes achieving 'Net Zero' by 2070, rooftop solarization for one crore households and robust health initiatives.The Indian economy's resilience takes center stage amidst positive indicators of declining current account deficit as a percentage of GDP, falling unemployment rates, and a notable rise in digital transactions. These statistics affirm the robustness of the economy, showcasing a trajectory of growth and stability.The achievements in taxation reforms are nothing short of remarkable, with direct tax collections more than trebling in the last decade, the number of tax return filers increasing by 2.4 times, average processing time of tax returns plummeting from 93 days in FY 2013-14 to an impressive 10 days in FY 2023-24, resulting in issuance of quick refunds. These are the results of consistent progressive measures thus obviating the need for, and rightly avoiding, any last-minute populist measures.No change in existing tax rates, both for direct and indirect taxes, is a good indicator of stability and predictability for investors and taxpayers.A welcome move to waive outstanding tax demands that are minor, disputed, and unreconciled. This involves the withdrawal of outstanding direct tax demands up to Rs. 25,000 pertaining to the period up to FY 2009-10 and up to Rs.10,000 for FY 2010-11 to 2014-15.The Government's commitment to fostering a business-friendly environment is evident in its intent to extend specific tax benefits for start-ups, investments by sovereign wealth funds/ pension funds, and certain IFSC units. The extension has been made now until March 31, 2025. This might help in creating a conducive landscape for business.To align with the CBDT notification issued earlier, the provisions relating to tax collection at source concerning remittances under the Liberalized Remittance Scheme have now been formally incorporated in the Finance Bill, 2024, setting the rate at 20% for amounts exceeding Rs. 7 lakhs in a financial year.The Finance Bill, 2024 proposes an extension of the time limit for introducing the faceless scheme by the Central Government for transfer pricing proceedings, DRP Proceedings, and ITAT Proceedings, up to March 31, 2025.The interim Budget 2024 may not have proposed significant tax announcements, but it very well positioned the prelude to the full budget post the upcoming elections. Considering the potential impact on the population across the four pillars of GYAN, a sizable portion of India stands to be covered. The interim Budget’s focus on the tax front resembles a report card, highlighting the maturity achieved by our tax system. The enhancement of taxpayer services was emphasized as a key priority.","This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data and N for Nari utthan.

Interim Budget for a Viksit Bharat: It’s for everyone and all,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/interim-budget-for-a-viksit-bharat-its-for-everyone-and-all/articleshow/107497439.cms,"By Akhilesh Tuteja

The Finance Minister on February 01, 2024, delivered a truly innovative interim budget. At first glance, it did not seem like an interim budget but looked more like the budget to drive further growth and a continuum of inclusive growth-oriented investments.At the outset, this budget brings a wonderful balance between fiscal prudence and continued investment for growth.It's not easy to continue the glide path of reducing the fiscal deficit and continuing to make significant investments in all areas including infrastructure, R&D, energy transition, technology, skilling, and social welfare. The surprising reduction in fiscal deficit of 5.8% as against the budgeted 5.9% for FY24 and the projection of 5.1% in FY25 with a clear focus on increasing investments was a huge positive.This was a budget for everyone and all because it caters to every part of the Indian economy and society. The FM has carefully catered to the investment needs of various sectors. The continued focus on youth, impoverished, women and farmers to increase their involvement and contribution to economic growth is evident. By committing an 11.1% increase in capital expenditure to 11,11,111 lakh crore, the FM has clearly brought every single 1 in this growth journey.What was very impressive was the inclusion strategy of the government. The focus on women's empowerment for the past few years is unprecedented, which is reflected in the inclusion of women in the workforce moving from 23.3% to 37% in the last five years. The thirty crore Mudra Yojna loans to women entrepreneurs were a great boost to the Nari Shakti initiative. We already have over 10 million Lakhpati Didis and what is truly evident is like a corporate CFO, the FM has revised the earlier target of 20 million Lakhpati Didis to 30 million. The government also plans to invest in initiatives to encourage young girls between the ages of 9 and 14 to undertake the vaccination for cervical cancer which is again a great boost to Nari Shakti.A lot needs to be done to bring more women into all parts of economic growth but the journey so far and the vision of the future is truly inspiring.While India continues on its technological prowess and makes its mark in new technologies like Artificial Intelligence, we need a multi-pronged strategy to harness the power of AI. We need a clear focus on building AI systems in India so that we not only emerge as a global leader in this new era but can build models, which are specific to India that will benefit Indians. At the same time, we need a very wide coverage program to build skills to leverage AI to its fullest potential. The biggest contribution we can make to the inclusion of youth in the economic development of the country is by skilling them in new skill areas. In the last few years, the Skill India Mission has trained 14 million youth, reskilled over 5 million youth and established a staggering 3,000 new ITIs. The future of any country will depend as much on capital investments as on skill investments.The focus on agricultural development and support to the farmer continues through direct financial assistance to farmers. The farmers have benefited by getting crop insurance through PM Fasal Bima Yojana. It's not just the farmers, the PM-SVANidhi provides credit assistance to a large number of street vendors.The last few years have seen the journey of affordable housing through Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY). There is a slight increase in allocation to launch a scheme for encouraging the middle class to build or buy new homes. This investment will likely propel a wider economic development and increase employment.India has seen a tremendous rise in entrepreneurship in the last few years. In order to continue the journey and promote new startups, the government proposes to extend certain tax benefits, which are expiring from March 2024 to March 2025. The MSMEs have not been left behind. With a proposal to provide timely finances to such enterprises, the government has paved the way for their growth, so they can look to compete globally.All in all, it’s a truly inclusive budget with a clear focus on development not just by giving away freebies but enabling the people to participate in the economic development activity. While the FM calls the comprehensive GDP - Governance, Development & Performance – to me, this budget is inclusive of another GDP – gender, demography, and professions.","Akhilesh Tuteja is Partner and Head, Clients and Markets, KPMG in India.

‘Enough domestic sources of demand to counter drag from external sector’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/enough-domestic-sources-of-demand-to-counter-drag-from-external-sector/articleshow/107372012.cms,"Do you think the

creates room for lower interest rates?

One of the issues that the Budget has flagged is the demographic challenge and opportunity and the societal change that is taking place. How do you view this?

Niti Aayog is working on the Viksit Bharat roadmap. What will be the focus areas?

You are as much a representative of the Centre as well as the states. Is it time to revisit the entire formula for transfers to states particularly on the issue of cesses and surcharges?

Suman Bery , who heads Niti Aayog , the govt think tank, is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China, which he says is also an opportunity for India. The economist is confident that Indian states remain resilient. Excerpts of the interview with TOI.The finance ministry expects the economy to grow 7% next year.Given the global situation, how do you see the prospects?The belief in the finance ministry is that we have a possible drag coming from the external sector but that we have other sources. We have enough domestic sources of demand. One has to applaud the political and economic judgment of FM in deciding that it was appropriate to pursue the path of fiscal consolidation. There is transparency. What this actually reflects is responsible economic management, which is one reason we are where we are. Second, it also creates a buffer so that there is policy space if we do encounter headwinds.That’s the hope and expectation. We have an independent central bank and an inflation targeting central bank, so it is up to the monetary policy committee to take a call through the monetary policy committee on the repo rate .The PM has said that when India grows its states grow. India is a composite of 37 states and UTs. They are each at very different points in their demographic transition. There are some states where the net replacement rate is down to 1%, like Kerala . There are others, particularly UP and Bihar, which are in their earliest stage of demographic transition and each one of these states is the size of a large European country. There are two implications of that — one is internal labour mobility and it will become an even larger part of our growth model. The govt has taken several steps to create a unified market. Our main endowment is our human capital and that has to be equipped to participate in global exchange in many ways. We know from China, Japan that the demographic dividend partly depends on markets and on human capital. But the golden period is fairly short lived, about 15 years, when the so called dependency ratio declines. The other big opportunity the PM has been highlighting is bringing women much more into the active labour force.When Niti was set up there was the idea of a three-year vision and a seven-year strategy paper. The reality is that schemes of govt tend to be aligned with the award of the Finance Commission . There are various established building blocks or hand holds which are already a matter of govt policy. The PM is much more interested in a national debate on what it means to be a Viksit Bharat or modern society. We have a collective goal and it is for the democratic polity to define what that goal should be. Its emphatically not for a super mandarin bureaucracy. It is not going to be Lee Kwan Yew’s Singapore led from the top.It’s entirely a finance ministry matter but I would be lying if I didn’t say when I visit certain states there is this complaint. A big frontier would be resource mobilisation at the state level. Second is going to be rationalisation of subsidies not only at the Union level, but also at the state level. All chief ministers sit on my governing council. When they convene as the governing council, I see them in their role as development practitioners. The world is beginning to appreciate quite how much institutional and political maturity India attained in our 75 years and the most fundamental dimension of a democracy, we have orderly transfers of power. There are enough buffers to ensure that what happens in state finances is unlikely to create macro instability. Those risks are well contained by our Constitution. The chief ministers know that they are going to be judged by development outcomes and so you can have the sugar rush of changing of pension plans or various handouts but if the cupboard is bare you are not going to be able to deliver.","Suman Bery is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China.

Government's Marathon to 2047: Emphasis on Fiscal Prudence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/governments-marathon-to-2047-emphasis-on-fiscal-prudence/articleshow/107371788.cms,"What was the thinking behind keeping the vote on account absolutely straight?

So is it the idea to keep the Budget completely transparent?

The capex has risen 11.1% and there is an emphasis on infrastructure spending. But there is also the hope that the private sector will now take over and start capital spending. Given the geopolitical situation, how confident is the govt that it will pan out as planned?

Finance secretary T V Somanathan, in an interview with TOI, says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047 . Excerpts:If you see the Budget speech you will see the emphasis on 2047. The govt has set its sight on running that marathon.Running to 2047 is a marathon , it’s not a sprint. If you are going to run a marathon, you need to be in good shape and you can’t have short-term stimulants or something that will get you some yards and then it’s done.The whole focus is on making India a developed country by 2047, for which a healthy present and a strong fiscal position is an important concomitant. Some purely short term measures don’t really fit into that picture. It’s a consistent picture: focus on the long term for which you need to build strength in the short term and that needs to be done by prudence in fiscal policy and by not doing things which can detract you from that path. Not doing the wrong thing is more important than appearing to do things.The idea is that govt finances may be good, bad or indifferent depending on the times, depending on the circumstances, depending on the policies. But what is the position should be reflected as reasonably and accurately as possible. That is an emphasis. As regards the Finance Commission, again the terms of reference that have been given to them are the terms in the Constitution.What is the means by which the devolution should be done is a matter they have full discretion. They can actually take all kinds of factors into account and in a sense we felt this time based on my review of the previous commissions that the right expression would be less is more. The shorter, less prescriptive terms of reference gives full scope for all stakeholders including state govts to express their viewpoints and for the commission to take a balanced view of the different perspectives and then come to its award. Ultimately the award of the Finance Commission is about devolution and grant for which full scope has now been given to them.n There are incipient signs of private capital expenditure accelerating. There are some surveys I have seen done by some of the chambers industry, which show high levels of investment. The PMI, which is a sort of leading indicator, is also looking pretty healthy. Capacity utilisation is one reason that private sector capital expenditure doesn’t immediately pick up when the economy starts accelerating because there is surplus capacity.But increasingly I get the sense that many industries are beginning to reach levels where they have to add capacity. When that happens capital investment will happen. Another pointer also mentioned in the Budget speech you may notice that our airlines have placed large orders for planes — that is capital expenditure.When you import 1,000 aircraft, it’s just not 1,000 aircraft, there are concomitant additions to ground handling facilities, you need airports to expand, you need to employ people to do that. That means a lot of jobs. The aircraft is capital but then look at the effect it is going to have on skilled jobs. So capital expenditure is happening. I am fairly confident that we will have decent capital expenditure in the year to come and that will become a new source of acceleration.",Finance secretary T V Somanathan says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047.

Income Tax Changes Budget 2024 : In the recent Budget 2024 speech, the Finance Minister kept the Section 80C tax deduction limit unchanged. The maximum limit for claiming tax benefits under Section 80C remains at Rs 1.5 lakh for the current fiscal year 2023-24 and will stay the same for individuals looking to save on taxes through Section 80C investments in the upcoming fiscal year 2024-25.Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions. Individuals can reduce their gross taxable income by up to Rs 1.5 lakh per financial year by engaging in these specific investments or expenditures.You can save on taxes through Section 80C by investing in things like Employees' Provident Fund (EPF), Public Provident Fund (PPF), Equity Linked Saving Scheme (ELSS) mutual funds, National Savings Certificate (NSC), and 5-year tax-saving fixed deposits with banks or post offices. Additionally, paying life insurance policy premiums also qualifies for tax benefits under Section 80C.It is important to note that each eligible investment comes with its specific maximum limit, rate of return, liquidity, and taxation rules for the earned returns, states ET in a report. For instance, the most you can invest in PPF in a financial year is Rs 1.5 lakh. Meanwhile, there's no limit on the amount you can invest in ELSS mutual funds, but the Section 80C deduction is capped at Rs 1.5 lakh.If individuals can't make specific investments, they can still get deductions under Section 80C from their gross taxable income through certain expenses. These expenses include repaying the principal amount of a home loan, tuition fees for children, payment of stamp duty, registration fees, and other costs related to buying a house.Since the financial year 2020-21, individuals without any business income must annually choose between the old and new tax regimes. As of the fiscal year 2023-24, the new tax regime is the default option. Consequently, individuals seeking tax deductions under Section 80C must opt for the old tax regime since this deduction isn't available in the new tax regime. It's crucial for taxpayers to be aware of these rules to make informed decisions about their tax planning and investment strategies.","Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget which is an interim budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year. The budget talks about inclusive development both, social and geographical, especially for youth, women, farmers, and the poor. Continued focus on improving logistics through infrastructure spend on roads, rail, airports, ports increases productivity for companies and citizens alike.To make ‘Viksit Bharat’ by 2047, the government’s focus is on improving and empowering people’s capabilities through various skilling initiatives. It is encouraging to see that Skill India Mission has succeeded in training more than 1.4 crore youth and upskilling and reskilling 54 lakh youth. I am particularly happy to see the continued focus on youth and women entrepreneurship and the announcement of a new fund which will give interest free 50 year loans for startups will provide a domestic fillip to startups supplementing venture capital we have traditionally relied on from abroad.PM Mudra Yojana has sanctioned 43 crore loans aggregating to 22.5 lakh crore to youth entrepreneurs and thirty crore Mudra Yojana loans to women entrepreneurs. There are several other schemes like Fund of Funds, Start-Up India, and Start-Up Credit Guarantee schemes that are assisting our youth. Further, the extension of tax benefits to Start-ups and investments made by sovereign wealth funds/pension funds, till 31st March 2025 depicts the government’s effort to support the startup eco- system.This aligns quite well with India Sanitation Coalition’s efforts to give impetus to the start-up world. Over the past 7 editions of our ISC-FICCI Sanitation Awards, we have recognized and promoted several start-ups in the sanitation space, many of whom are successful businesses now!While the finance minister did not provide detailed information on Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH), the budget allocation sees a slight increase in spend demonstrating continued focus on this highly successful program. The acknowledgement that the private sector has increasingly played a substantial role in addressing WASH issues in both urban and rural areas, with numerous projects underway through Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs), highlights the government's commitment to addressing challenges in this sector.A perfect example is the LightHouse Initiative initiated by the Department of Drinking Water along with the India Sanitation Coalition (ISC) by partnering with major corporates across India to develop model villages in Solid and Liquid Waste Management (SLWM) under SBM-Grameen. From this budget, there is an expectation that the government will persist in prioritizing Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) as the path toward achieving the country's Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6). Additionally, it is hoped that the government will uphold its commitment to making necessary infrastructural investments for SLWM.The budget speech rightly celebrates the fact that we have 83 lakh SHGs and 9 crore women beneficiaries. The microfinance movement in the country and the possibility of empowering women members of SHGs through livelihood skilling is a key to bringing women into mainstream economic advancement.The focus on green growth, rooftop solar, wind, biomass, e-vehicles all help with our green energy thrust. The tourism sector was mentioned and could be a huge job provider for youth and women.Guided by the principle ‘Reform, Perform, and Transform’, the budget emphasizes efficient implementation of various policies by improving coordination with states and relevant stakeholders. This is critical both for infra spend and social programsIt is noteworthy that ISC’s Climate Resilient Coastal Cities project which is being implemented in PPP (Public-Private Partnership) mode in four coastal states of Karnataka, Gujarat, Goa and Maharashtra is congruent with the government’s priority of promoting climate-resilient activities for the blue economy 2.0, a scheme for restoration and adaptation measures, and coastal aquaculture.The budget also focuses on the Aspirational districts program where assistance will be given to the states for faster development of aspirational districts and blocks, including the generation of ample economic opportunities. This is again very crucial as it has a huge potential to transform the landscape of our country while making sure no -one is left behind.Overall, this budget has embraced economic strategies and develops the building blocks that nurture and uphold growth, promote inclusive and sustainable development, and enhance productivity.","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year.

FDI norms in certain sectors likely to be eased under new government: DPIIT Secretary,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/fdi-norms-in-certain-sectors-likely-to-be-eased-under-new-government-dpiit-secretary/articleshow/110229982.cms,"NEW DELHI: India has recently relaxed foreign direct investment norms in the space sector and there is a possibility of further FDI liberalisation in certain other areas when the new government will come to power, a top official said on Saturday. Secretary in Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) Rajesh Kumar Singh said that in the last few years, India has liberalised FDI policy in many segments.India has one of the most liberal foreign direct investment (FDI) policies in the world and in fact more liberal than many Southeast Asian countries that the country is often compared with, he said.Recently FDI norms were eased in the space sector and ""it is quite possible that under a new government, we can attempt some further liberalisation of any pockets that are left and where some liberalisation is possible ,"" Singh said here at CII's annual business summit.The Lok Sabha elections are underway in the country and the counting is scheduled for June 4.The government has eased FDI norms in the space sector by allowing 100 per cent overseas investment in making components for satellites, as part of efforts to attract overseas players and private companies into the segment.FDI in India declined 13 per cent to USD 32.03 billion in April-December 2023, dragged down by lower infusion in computer hardware and software, telecom, auto, and pharma sectors, according to the government data.Talking about the success of the production linked incentive schemes (PLI), the secretary said so far Rs 1.13 lakh crore of investments have come in and the beneficiary companies have recorded over Rs 9 lakh crore of sales, exports of Rs 3.45 lakh crore and created jobs for over 8 lakh people.The scheme was announced in 2021 for 14 sectors, including telecommunication, white goods, textiles, manufacturing of medical devices, automobiles, speciality steel, food products, high efficiency solar PV modules, advanced chemistry cell battery, drones, and pharma with an outlay of Rs 1.97 lakh crore.Singh said some people criticize the scheme stating that it has not led to increase in domestic value addition but they should know that it takes time.People have raised issues with regard to India attracting players in the semi-conductor segment stating that it is too capital intensive and not suitable for India.""The target is not labour intensity, it is mainly strategic and to ensure that we do not become over dependent on unsecured supply chains,"" he said.On ease of doing business, he said they are working on the World Bank 's Business Ready (B-READY) index for which the survey will start in August and this ranking involves a new set of indices which will cover ease of entry, ease of operation and ease of exit of business.The World Bank has shared a set of 1,370 questions which will be assessed across various economies.""Our survey starts in September. DPIIT along with various ministries is at work and trying to sort of first assess the situation and thereafter see whether we can make some quick reforms in certain areas to ensure that our overall performance improves,"" Singh said.These rankings despite certain shortcomings have a signalling effect on foreign investors.""We need to ensure that we do not regress and we continue to improve when it comes to those rankings,"" he said.He added that the department is working on the second edition of Jan Vishwas law after getting inputs from industry associations.""We have to do several rounds of these exercises to eliminate some of the vexatious and penal provisions that are unfriendly for business,"" the secretary said.In the first edition of the Jan Vishwas law, over 180 provisions were decriminalised in 42 Central Acts administered by 19 ministries and departments. Under the first Jan Vishwas law, imprisonment and/or fine was removed in some provisions.Some of the legislations that were amended included the Boilers Act, Indian Forest Act, Drugs and Cosmetics Act, Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation Act, Warehousing Corporations Act, Food Corporations Act, Patents Act, and Food Safety and Standards Act.Further on the country's intellectual property rights (IPR) regime, the secretary said India has created a situation where its patent regime is meeting or getting close to global benchmarks in terms of patent examination time and approval.The number of patents granted went up from 5,978 in 2014-15 to 1.3 lakh in 2023-24.On how to enhance involvement of states in the reform process, he said ""there are some weapons that we have to nudge them in the reform areas that we feel are really important for the country"".","The Lok Sabha elections are underway in the country and the counting is scheduled for June 4.

Spiritus' novel approach to direct air capture could address the major cost challenges of current direct air capture approaches and includes reducing energy needs, passive air collection, and a proprietary sorbent material to potentially remove carbon from the atmosphere at up to a tenfold increase in adsorption efficiency compared to existing methods.Aramco and Rondo agreed to explore deployment of heat batteries in Aramco's global facilities to reduce operating costs and support emissions reduction initiatives.The companies have started engineering studies for the first industrial-scale deployment of Rondo Heat Batteries that could contribute to the reduction of emissions from Aramco facilities, with subsequent scale-up to 1GWh.Ali A.

This has led to declining prices and consumer hesitation in property investments, exerting pressure on the Chinese government to devise effective support measures.Recent announcements included broad measures to support the sector, as detailed in a meeting attended by regulators, top banks, local governments, and property market representatives. Specifics on the number of houses to be purchased were not provided.State media reported that the central bank and the National Financial Regulatory Administration would cut the minimum down payment rate for first-time homebuyers to 15%, one of the lowest rates in China’s history. The rate for second-home purchases will be reduced to 25%.Pantheon Macro economist Duncan Wrigley reacted cautiously, stating, ""China's new property support measures are helpful, but no magic bullet. The new measures are a step in the right direction and should speed up the bottoming out of upper-tier city housing markets, but the policy funding amount announced so far is disappointing and will probably need to be increased.""This week’s market movements reflect a complex global financial environment where regional developments and investor sentiments interact dynamically, highlighting the delicate balance policymakers must maintain to sustain economic growth.(With inputs from agencies)","The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed above 40,000 points for the first time.

An earlier state department statement said the scheme had generated at least $6.8 million for North Korea. It said the North Koreans involved were linked to North Korea's munitions industry department, which oversees development of the country's ballistic missiles, weapons production, and research and development programmes.An indictment filed in federal court in Washington last week and unsealed on Thursday said charges had been filed against Christina Marie Chapman, 49, of Litchfield Park, Arizona; Ukrainian Oleksandr Didenko, 27, of Kyiv; and three other foreign nationals. A justice department statement said Chapman was arrested Wednesday, while Didenko was arrested on May 7 by Poland at the request of US, which is seeking his extradition.The head of the justice department's criminal division, Nicole Argentieri, said the alleged crimes ""benefited the North Korean govt, giving it a revenue stream and, in some instances, proprietary information stolen by the co-conspirators."" The charges ""should be a wakeup call for American companies and govt agencies that employ remote IT workers,"" she said in the statement.The DoJ said Didenko was accused of creating fake accounts at US IT job search platforms, selling them to overseas IT workers, some of whom he believed were North Korean. It said overseas IT workers using Didenko's services were also working with Chapman. Didenko's online domain, upworksell.com, was seized Thursday by the justice department, the statement said. The DoJ statement said the FBI executed search warrants for US-based ""laptop farms"" - residences that hosted multiple laptops for overseas IT workers. It said that through these farms, including one Chapman hosted from her home, US-based facilitators logged onto US firm computer networks and allowed the overseas IT workers to remotely access the laptops, using US IP addresses to make it appear they were in the US.North Korea is under UN sanctions aimed at cutting funding for its missile and nuclear weapons programmes and experts say it has sought to generate income illicitly.","US prosecutors say North Korea-linked IT workers posing as Americans to obtain remote-work jobs at hundreds of US companies.

Bettencourt Meyers, 70, ranks 14th on the index with a net worth of $101 billion.Dell, 59, also recently saw his wealth crest the $100 billion mark after demand for AI-related equipment boosted Dell Technologies’ share price to record highs. He’s now 11th on Bloomberg’s wealth index with a fortune of $113 billion.Other new joiners include Slim, 84, who ranks 13th with $106 billion. The richest person in Latin America added about $28 billion to his net worth in 2023 amid a boom in the Mexican peso that’s helped to boost the stock of companies in his business empire, which range from construction to operating restaurants and shops.There are also old names coming back to the club. Gautam Adani, 61, recently returned to the elite group after a short-seller attack caused him to lose more wealth than anyone in 2023. Shares of his flagship Adani Enterprises Ltd rose as global investors increasingly focus on India businesses.Leading the pack is LVMH founder and Chief Executive Officer Bernard Arnault, 75, with a net worth of $222 billion. He derives most of his wealth from his stake in the world’s largest luxury-good maker.Amazon.com Inc founder Jeff Bezos , 60, ranks second with a net worth of $208 billion, thanks to his ownership of the world’s largest online retailer. Tesla Inc CEO Elon Musk , 52, has a net worth of $187 billion and ranks the third on the index. His wealth, which has fallen by more than $40 billion this year, mainly consists of his stake in the world’s most valuable car maker.","The combined net worth for these people is up 13% this year to $2.2 trillion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

Project Astra may be the future of AI at Google,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/project-astra-may-be-the-future-of-ai-at-google/articleshow/110191607.cms,"During the keynote session at Google I/O 2024, the company showcased a remarkable array of artificial intelligence (AI) models and tools they have been developing. Most of these new features will be available in public previews in the upcoming months. However, the most intriguing technology previewed at the event, developed by Google DeepMind and named Project Astra, will not be released for some time.Project Astra is an advanced AI assistant featuring real-time, computer vision-based interaction capabilities.Project Astra represents a significant leap beyond current chatbots, capable of performing highly sophisticated tasks. Google employs a strategy where its largest and most powerful AI models are used to train production-ready versions. Demis Hassabis, the co-founder and CEO of Google DeepMind, highlighted Project Astra as an example of this approach. He introduced the AI assistant by saying, “Today, we have some exciting new progress to share about the future of AI assistants that we are calling Project Astra. For a long time, we wanted to build a universal AI agent that can be truly helpful in everyday life.”In a video demonstration, Google’s prototype AI assistant responded to voice commands by analysing visual input from a phone camera and smart glasses. It accurately identified sequences of code, suggested enhancements to electrical circuit diagrams, recognised the King’s Cross area of London through the camera lens, and reminded the user of where they had placed their glasses.","Project Astra is an advanced AI assistant featuring real-time, computer vision- based interaction capabilities.

Warren Buffett's latest bet: Berkshire reveals $6.7 billion investment in insurance giant,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/warren-buffetts-latest-bet-berkshire-reveals-6-7-billion-investment-in-insurance-giant/articleshow/110175706.cms,"NEW DELHI: Legendary investor Warren Buffett ’s Berkshire Hathaway has unveiled a significant investment in the insurance giant Chubb , marking a major move that was kept confidential until now. The stake, amounting to nearly 26 million shares, was disclosed in a recent Securities and Exchange Commission filing, representing a value of approximately $6.7 billion.This investment in Chubb highlights Buffett's ongoing strategy of investing heavily in financial firms. Berkshire Hathaway, under Buffett's leadership, has historically favored the insurance sector, owning companies such as Geico, National Indemnity, and General Re.Berkshire owns many other companies — including BNSF railroad, a number of utilities and an assortment of manufacturing and retail companies — but insurers, like Geico and General Reinsurance, have always been at the core of the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate. So it makes sense that another insurer like Zurich-based Chubb might appeal to Buffett.CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert said in a note to investors that Chubb is now one of the 10 biggest holdings in Berkshire's portfolio. “We can’t speculate whether Berkshire would pursue an outright acquisition of CB, but we note their business mixes are highly complementary,"" Seifert wrote.Berkshire had previously requested ""confidential treatment"" from the SEC to keep the buildup of this position private. The disclosure of this substantial investment comes after Chubb recently made headlines for underwriting a nearly $92 million appeal bond for President Donald Trump in the defamation lawsuit filed by E Jean Carroll.Following the revelation of Berkshire's new stake, Chubb's stock experienced an 8% surge in after-hours trading, reflecting investor confidence boosted by Buffett’s involvement.This move is part of a broader trend where Berkshire Hathaway has been concentrating its investments in financial entities, including Ally Financial, American Express, and Bank of America, while reducing stakes in consumer products. Notably, Buffett’s firm scaled back its holdings in Apple and HP significantly in recent months.Berkshire sold off a little over 116 million Apple shares in the quarter — accounting for about 13% of its stake — to trim its biggest single investment. But it still holds nearly 790 million Apple shares, and Buffett told shareholders that he expected the iPhone maker to remain a long-term holding.The investment community closely watches Buffett's investment choices, often emulating his strategies, which underscores the significant market impact of his decisions.(With inputs from agencies)","Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway has unveiled a significant investment in the insurance giant Chubb.

As part of this process, we shared an optional internal transfer opportunity with a subset of employees."" However, the spokesperson refrained from specifying the exact number of employees who received this request.The spokesperson emphasized that Microsoft remains dedicated to its operations in China and will continue to maintain a presence there, as well as in other markets worldwide.The Wall Street Journal, citing individuals familiar with the matter, reported that earlier in the week, the employees, primarily Chinese nationals working as engineers, were presented with the option to relocate to the United States, Ireland, Australia, or New Zealand.This development occurs against the backdrop of deteriorating US-China relations, as the administration of President Joe Biden has increased tariffs on various Chinese imports, including electric vehicle batteries, computer chips, and medical products.

"Dow, S&P 500, Nasdaq end at records as US inflation cools",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/dow-sp-500-nasdaq-end-at-records-as-us-inflation-cools/articleshow/110162061.cms,"Wall Street surged to new heights on Wednesday following encouraging signs of easing inflation, which has sparked anticipation of upcoming interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve . The release of US consumer price data for April showed a slight moderation in inflation rates, sending the three major stock indices to record levels.The Dow Jones Industrial Average soared by 0.9 percent, reaching 39,908.00 and nearing the monumental 40,000 mark.The S&P 500 increased by 1.2 percent to 5,308.15, and the Nasdaq Composite grew by 1.4 percent, ending the day at 16,742.39, marking consecutive record closes.This optimism was partly due to the monthly consumer price index indicating an annual inflation rate of 3.4 percent for April, a slight decrease from 3.5 percent in March. ""The reports together point to a cooling of inflation and economic growth, as well as an increase in the likelihood that the Fed will begin its rate-cutting cycle later this year,"" commented Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research.Despite robust market performances, US retail sales in April were stagnant, missing the anticipated 0.4 percent growth. This could signal a deceleration in consumer spending, potentially impacting economic stability.In the bond market, the easing of Treasury yields alleviated some pressure, enhancing the appeal of stocks, especially those likely to benefit from lower interest rates. Homebuilders like Lennar, DR Horton, and PulteGroup all saw significant gains, driven by hopes that rate cuts could lower mortgage costs.Tech stocks also enjoyed a boost, with Nvidia rising by 3.6 percent, significantly contributing to the S&P 500's gains. Utility and real estate sectors likewise performed well, as lower bond yields made their dividends more attractive.Market sentiment was influenced by various corporate performances and economic indicators. Dell Technologies saw an 11.2 percent jump after an optimistic analyst upgrade from Morgan Stanley, while Boeing faced a 2.1 percent drop amid legal troubles. The fluctuating fortunes of 'meme stocks' such as GameStop and AMC Entertainment highlighted the volatile nature of these investments, with significant losses following recent gains.As traders now place a nearly 95 percent probability on the Fed cutting rates at least once this year, the market remains sensitive to economic signals and Federal Reserve policies. This delicate balance of slowing the economy to manage inflation without triggering a recession continues to be a central theme in market dynamics.(With inputs from agencies)","The Dow Jones Industrial Average soared by 0.9 percent, reaching 39,908.00 and nearing the monumental 40,000 mark.
