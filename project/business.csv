TCS links variable pay to work from office,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tcs-links-variable-pay-to-work-from-office/articleshow/109482497.cms,"BENGALURU: TCS has updated its variable pay policy to include work from office as a crucial factor. The revised policy, which was implemented shortly after the company's quarterly results, has four attendance slabs that determine the variable pay for employees.According to the new policy, employees who work from office for less than 60% of the time will not receive any variable pay for the quarter.Those with an office attendance between 60-75% will receive 50% of the variable pay, while employees who come to the office 75-85% of the time will be eligible for 75% of the variable pay. Only those with office compliance levels above 85% will receive the full variable pay for the quarter.TOI had reported in Feb about TCS linking variable payout to complying with its recent return-to-work mandate. Business unit heads have written to their respective teams that assigning grades, which are a prerequisite for rolling out promotions, will depend on their track record of working from office.The policy also warns that persistent non-compliance with the 85% work from office requirement will result in disciplinary action. ""Employees' compliance to work from home will be reviewed every quarter. In the event an employee is found to be in violation of the laid down policies, there will be implications on the annual performance review, compensation, and career progression of the employee,"" the policy stated. An email sent to TCS on the updated policy didn't elicit a response till the time of going to press.In their notes to employees after the March quarter results, CEO K Krithivasan and CHRO Milind Lakkad mentioned the importance of returning to office. Krithivasan said, ""The last quarter has seen most of you return to the workplace, creating shared experiences, nurturing greater learning, collaboration, and camaraderie.""Other Indian IT companies, such as Infosys and Wipro, have not linked variable payouts to the return to office mandate. Wipro has distributed an average variable payout of 85% for the March quarter of the FY24, according to the company's CHRO, Saurabh Govil. This is consistent with the 85% variable pay given to junior employees in the Dec quarter.TCS employees are expected to work from office all five days of the week. The company is the first among India's major IT firms to take action against employees who do not comply with this requirement. It has already begun reducing the city allowance for those who do not come to office on all five days.","TCS employees are expected to work from office all five days of the week.

PAN misused for HRA fraud? Need to worry,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/pan-misused-for-hra-fraud-need-to-worry/articleshow/109482522.cms,"NEW DELHI: If you are one of those whose permanent account number (PAN) has been misused by someone to claim fake house rent allowance (HRA), you may have some reason to worry unless the person, who has given the wrong PAN, decided to update his or her income tax return .But tax authorities are expected to give you a patient hearing and experts said those who have been affected by the fraud will have to prove that their PAN has been misused.Last month, TOI had first reported how the income tax department had come across at least 8,000-10,000 cases of wrong reporting of PAN by unscrupulous elements. The income tax department said this did not mean that it was going to reopen past cases and had instead ""underlined"" that the e-verification had been done to ""alert cases of mismatches of information for FY 2020-21 only without affecting the others"".The department did not comment on the issue or the number of taxpayers who have revised their returns.""Although the department has clarified that there is no special drive, those whose PAN has been misused may still receive a notice or question confirming about their rental income in case such landlords appear in the sample collected by tax authorities. But they should not worry as the department is aware of the issue of misuse of PAN, rather than investigating deeply on rental income escaping in the hands of landlords. Taxpayers should, however, cooperate and provide appropriate response to such notice and in a timely manner to avoid inconvenience,"" said Kuldip Kumar, partner at Mainstay Tax Advisors.The person whose PAN has been misused may need to provide some additional documents. ""In case of persons whose PAN have been misused by persons receiving HRA, even if an assessment is reopened based on misquoting of PAN by the recipient of HRA, the PAN holder can establish that he/she is not in receipt of rent and seek for dropping of assessment against them. Following documents can be used to establish that PAN has been misquoted: (a) bank statement to show that no rent was received, and (b) self-sworn affidavit to state that the subject property is not owned by the PAN holder,"" said S Sriram, partner at Lakshmikumaran and Sridharan.","Last month, TOI had first reported how the income tax department had come across at least 8,000-10,000 cases of wrong reporting of PAN by unscrupulous elements.

Apple's two India-based company-owned stores, which recently celebrated their first anniversary, have each generated impressive revenue of Rs 190-210 crore in the previous fiscal year, placing them among the top-performing retail outlets of the iPhone maker worldwide.According to an industry insider quoted by ET, ""The two Apple stores have clocked monthly average sales of Rs 16-17 crore each consistently since their launch.The Mumbai store revenue has been a little higher than the Delhi one due to a larger size.""The source added, ""It has met Apple's expectations, matching some of the best-performing store launches and they are now aggressively scouting space for the next three company-owned stores.""Apple's CEO, Tim Cook , personally attended the store openings in Mumbai ( Apple BKC ) on April 18 and New Delhi ( Apple Saket ) two days later.

The Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) has instructed all regulated payment companies to monitor high-value or suspicious transactions during the general elections , as per multiple senior executives familiar with the matter. In a letter dated April 15, the central bank directed payment system operators (PSOs) to prevent any potential misuse of electronic fund transfer mechanisms that could influence voters or indirectly fund candidates participating in the elections.According to one of the executives quoted by ET, ""The regulator wants payment companies to track high-value merchant payments specifically.Also recurring person-to-person payments can be brought under scrutiny.""The directive applies to fintech companies such as Razorpay, Cashfree, CCAvenue, and Mswipe, which are all regulated payment aggregators, as well as mobile wallet licence holders like PhonePe and MobiKwik.The RBI's directive cites concerns raised by the Election Commission of India, the apex body conducting the elections. Payment companies have been asked to track dubious transactions and report them to the relevant authorities.Historically, cash in circulation has increased during elections, and the RBI has typically instructed banks to monitor the movement of cash. However, industry insiders noted that this is one of the first instances where the regulator has specifically called out payment companies and asked them to track digital payment movement, given the widespread adoption of digital payments and the popularity of Unified Payments Interface (UPI) and card payments.","The Reserve Bank of India has instructed all regulated payment companies to monitor high-value or suspicious transactions during the general elections.

The finance minister set the stage for a ""Viksit Bharat by 2047"", on the core principles of ‘Sabka Saath’, ‘Sabka Vikas’, ‘Sabka Vishwas’, with ‘Sabka Prayas’ being added as a new theme in the interim Budget.This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data i.e., farmer welfare and N for Nari utthan i.e., support for women entrepreneurs.These form the pillars of a comprehensive inclusive development. The Government's commitment to sustainable development under the strategy for Amrit Kaal includes achieving 'Net Zero' by 2070, rooftop solarization for one crore households and robust health initiatives.The Indian economy's resilience takes center stage amidst positive indicators of declining current account deficit as a percentage of GDP, falling unemployment rates, and a notable rise in digital transactions. These statistics affirm the robustness of the economy, showcasing a trajectory of growth and stability.The achievements in taxation reforms are nothing short of remarkable, with direct tax collections more than trebling in the last decade, the number of tax return filers increasing by 2.4 times, average processing time of tax returns plummeting from 93 days in FY 2013-14 to an impressive 10 days in FY 2023-24, resulting in issuance of quick refunds. These are the results of consistent progressive measures thus obviating the need for, and rightly avoiding, any last-minute populist measures.No change in existing tax rates, both for direct and indirect taxes, is a good indicator of stability and predictability for investors and taxpayers.A welcome move to waive outstanding tax demands that are minor, disputed, and unreconciled. This involves the withdrawal of outstanding direct tax demands up to Rs. 25,000 pertaining to the period up to FY 2009-10 and up to Rs.10,000 for FY 2010-11 to 2014-15.The Government's commitment to fostering a business-friendly environment is evident in its intent to extend specific tax benefits for start-ups, investments by sovereign wealth funds/ pension funds, and certain IFSC units. The extension has been made now until March 31, 2025. This might help in creating a conducive landscape for business.To align with the CBDT notification issued earlier, the provisions relating to tax collection at source concerning remittances under the Liberalized Remittance Scheme have now been formally incorporated in the Finance Bill, 2024, setting the rate at 20% for amounts exceeding Rs. 7 lakhs in a financial year.The Finance Bill, 2024 proposes an extension of the time limit for introducing the faceless scheme by the Central Government for transfer pricing proceedings, DRP Proceedings, and ITAT Proceedings, up to March 31, 2025.The interim Budget 2024 may not have proposed significant tax announcements, but it very well positioned the prelude to the full budget post the upcoming elections. Considering the potential impact on the population across the four pillars of GYAN, a sizable portion of India stands to be covered. The interim Budget’s focus on the tax front resembles a report card, highlighting the maturity achieved by our tax system. The enhancement of taxpayer services was emphasized as a key priority.","This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data and N for Nari utthan.

Interim Budget for a Viksit Bharat: It’s for everyone and all,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/interim-budget-for-a-viksit-bharat-its-for-everyone-and-all/articleshow/107497439.cms,"By Akhilesh Tuteja

The Finance Minister on February 01, 2024, delivered a truly innovative interim budget. At first glance, it did not seem like an interim budget but looked more like the budget to drive further growth and a continuum of inclusive growth-oriented investments.At the outset, this budget brings a wonderful balance between fiscal prudence and continued investment for growth.It's not easy to continue the glide path of reducing the fiscal deficit and continuing to make significant investments in all areas including infrastructure, R&D, energy transition, technology, skilling, and social welfare. The surprising reduction in fiscal deficit of 5.8% as against the budgeted 5.9% for FY24 and the projection of 5.1% in FY25 with a clear focus on increasing investments was a huge positive.This was a budget for everyone and all because it caters to every part of the Indian economy and society. The FM has carefully catered to the investment needs of various sectors. The continued focus on youth, impoverished, women and farmers to increase their involvement and contribution to economic growth is evident. By committing an 11.1% increase in capital expenditure to 11,11,111 lakh crore, the FM has clearly brought every single 1 in this growth journey.What was very impressive was the inclusion strategy of the government. The focus on women's empowerment for the past few years is unprecedented, which is reflected in the inclusion of women in the workforce moving from 23.3% to 37% in the last five years. The thirty crore Mudra Yojna loans to women entrepreneurs were a great boost to the Nari Shakti initiative. We already have over 10 million Lakhpati Didis and what is truly evident is like a corporate CFO, the FM has revised the earlier target of 20 million Lakhpati Didis to 30 million. The government also plans to invest in initiatives to encourage young girls between the ages of 9 and 14 to undertake the vaccination for cervical cancer which is again a great boost to Nari Shakti.A lot needs to be done to bring more women into all parts of economic growth but the journey so far and the vision of the future is truly inspiring.While India continues on its technological prowess and makes its mark in new technologies like Artificial Intelligence, we need a multi-pronged strategy to harness the power of AI. We need a clear focus on building AI systems in India so that we not only emerge as a global leader in this new era but can build models, which are specific to India that will benefit Indians. At the same time, we need a very wide coverage program to build skills to leverage AI to its fullest potential. The biggest contribution we can make to the inclusion of youth in the economic development of the country is by skilling them in new skill areas. In the last few years, the Skill India Mission has trained 14 million youth, reskilled over 5 million youth and established a staggering 3,000 new ITIs. The future of any country will depend as much on capital investments as on skill investments.The focus on agricultural development and support to the farmer continues through direct financial assistance to farmers. The farmers have benefited by getting crop insurance through PM Fasal Bima Yojana. It's not just the farmers, the PM-SVANidhi provides credit assistance to a large number of street vendors.The last few years have seen the journey of affordable housing through Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY). There is a slight increase in allocation to launch a scheme for encouraging the middle class to build or buy new homes. This investment will likely propel a wider economic development and increase employment.India has seen a tremendous rise in entrepreneurship in the last few years. In order to continue the journey and promote new startups, the government proposes to extend certain tax benefits, which are expiring from March 2024 to March 2025. The MSMEs have not been left behind. With a proposal to provide timely finances to such enterprises, the government has paved the way for their growth, so they can look to compete globally.All in all, it’s a truly inclusive budget with a clear focus on development not just by giving away freebies but enabling the people to participate in the economic development activity. While the FM calls the comprehensive GDP - Governance, Development & Performance – to me, this budget is inclusive of another GDP – gender, demography, and professions.","Akhilesh Tuteja is Partner and Head, Clients and Markets, KPMG in India.

We have enough domestic sources of demand. One has to applaud the political and economic judgment of FM in deciding that it was appropriate to pursue the path of fiscal consolidation. There is transparency. What this actually reflects is responsible economic management, which is one reason we are where we are. Second, it also creates a buffer so that there is policy space if we do encounter headwinds.That’s the hope and expectation. We have an independent central bank and an inflation targeting central bank, so it is up to the monetary policy committee to take a call through the monetary policy committee on the repo rate .The PM has said that when India grows its states grow. India is a composite of 37 states and UTs. They are each at very different points in their demographic transition. There are some states where the net replacement rate is down to 1%, like Kerala . There are others, particularly UP and Bihar, which are in their earliest stage of demographic transition and each one of these states is the size of a large European country. There are two implications of that — one is internal labour mobility and it will become an even larger part of our growth model. The govt has taken several steps to create a unified market. Our main endowment is our human capital and that has to be equipped to participate in global exchange in many ways. We know from China, Japan that the demographic dividend partly depends on markets and on human capital. But the golden period is fairly short lived, about 15 years, when the so called dependency ratio declines. The other big opportunity the PM has been highlighting is bringing women much more into the active labour force.When Niti was set up there was the idea of a three-year vision and a seven-year strategy paper. The reality is that schemes of govt tend to be aligned with the award of the Finance Commission . There are various established building blocks or hand holds which are already a matter of govt policy. The PM is much more interested in a national debate on what it means to be a Viksit Bharat or modern society. We have a collective goal and it is for the democratic polity to define what that goal should be. Its emphatically not for a super mandarin bureaucracy. It is not going to be Lee Kwan Yew’s Singapore led from the top.It’s entirely a finance ministry matter but I would be lying if I didn’t say when I visit certain states there is this complaint. A big frontier would be resource mobilisation at the state level. Second is going to be rationalisation of subsidies not only at the Union level, but also at the state level. All chief ministers sit on my governing council. When they convene as the governing council, I see them in their role as development practitioners. The world is beginning to appreciate quite how much institutional and political maturity India attained in our 75 years and the most fundamental dimension of a democracy, we have orderly transfers of power. There are enough buffers to ensure that what happens in state finances is unlikely to create macro instability. Those risks are well contained by our Constitution. The chief ministers know that they are going to be judged by development outcomes and so you can have the sugar rush of changing of pension plans or various handouts but if the cupboard is bare you are not going to be able to deliver.","Suman Bery is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China.

Government's Marathon to 2047: Emphasis on Fiscal Prudence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/governments-marathon-to-2047-emphasis-on-fiscal-prudence/articleshow/107371788.cms,"What was the thinking behind keeping the vote on account absolutely straight?

So is it the idea to keep the Budget completely transparent?

The capex has risen 11.1% and there is an emphasis on infrastructure spending. But there is also the hope that the private sector will now take over and start capital spending. Given the geopolitical situation, how confident is the govt that it will pan out as planned?

Finance secretary T V Somanathan, in an interview with TOI, says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047 . Excerpts:If you see the Budget speech you will see the emphasis on 2047. The govt has set its sight on running that marathon.Running to 2047 is a marathon , it’s not a sprint. If you are going to run a marathon, you need to be in good shape and you can’t have short-term stimulants or something that will get you some yards and then it’s done.The whole focus is on making India a developed country by 2047, for which a healthy present and a strong fiscal position is an important concomitant. Some purely short term measures don’t really fit into that picture. It’s a consistent picture: focus on the long term for which you need to build strength in the short term and that needs to be done by prudence in fiscal policy and by not doing things which can detract you from that path. Not doing the wrong thing is more important than appearing to do things.The idea is that govt finances may be good, bad or indifferent depending on the times, depending on the circumstances, depending on the policies. But what is the position should be reflected as reasonably and accurately as possible. That is an emphasis. As regards the Finance Commission, again the terms of reference that have been given to them are the terms in the Constitution.What is the means by which the devolution should be done is a matter they have full discretion. They can actually take all kinds of factors into account and in a sense we felt this time based on my review of the previous commissions that the right expression would be less is more. The shorter, less prescriptive terms of reference gives full scope for all stakeholders including state govts to express their viewpoints and for the commission to take a balanced view of the different perspectives and then come to its award. Ultimately the award of the Finance Commission is about devolution and grant for which full scope has now been given to them.n There are incipient signs of private capital expenditure accelerating. There are some surveys I have seen done by some of the chambers industry, which show high levels of investment. The PMI, which is a sort of leading indicator, is also looking pretty healthy. Capacity utilisation is one reason that private sector capital expenditure doesn’t immediately pick up when the economy starts accelerating because there is surplus capacity.But increasingly I get the sense that many industries are beginning to reach levels where they have to add capacity. When that happens capital investment will happen. Another pointer also mentioned in the Budget speech you may notice that our airlines have placed large orders for planes — that is capital expenditure.When you import 1,000 aircraft, it’s just not 1,000 aircraft, there are concomitant additions to ground handling facilities, you need airports to expand, you need to employ people to do that. That means a lot of jobs. The aircraft is capital but then look at the effect it is going to have on skilled jobs. So capital expenditure is happening. I am fairly confident that we will have decent capital expenditure in the year to come and that will become a new source of acceleration.",Finance secretary T V Somanathan says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047.

What is the Section 80C limit for tax deduction for FY 2024-25 after Interim Budget 2024?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/income-tax-budget-2024-2024-2025-section-80c-limit-epf-ppf-elss-nsc/articleshow/107353021.cms,"ALSO READ |

Income Tax Changes Budget 2024 : In the recent Budget 2024 speech, the Finance Minister kept the Section 80C tax deduction limit unchanged. The maximum limit for claiming tax benefits under Section 80C remains at Rs 1.5 lakh for the current fiscal year 2023-24 and will stay the same for individuals looking to save on taxes through Section 80C investments in the upcoming fiscal year 2024-25.Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions. Individuals can reduce their gross taxable income by up to Rs 1.5 lakh per financial year by engaging in these specific investments or expenditures.You can save on taxes through Section 80C by investing in things like Employees' Provident Fund (EPF), Public Provident Fund (PPF), Equity Linked Saving Scheme (ELSS) mutual funds, National Savings Certificate (NSC), and 5-year tax-saving fixed deposits with banks or post offices. Additionally, paying life insurance policy premiums also qualifies for tax benefits under Section 80C.It is important to note that each eligible investment comes with its specific maximum limit, rate of return, liquidity, and taxation rules for the earned returns, states ET in a report. For instance, the most you can invest in PPF in a financial year is Rs 1.5 lakh. Meanwhile, there's no limit on the amount you can invest in ELSS mutual funds, but the Section 80C deduction is capped at Rs 1.5 lakh.If individuals can't make specific investments, they can still get deductions under Section 80C from their gross taxable income through certain expenses. These expenses include repaying the principal amount of a home loan, tuition fees for children, payment of stamp duty, registration fees, and other costs related to buying a house.Since the financial year 2020-21, individuals without any business income must annually choose between the old and new tax regimes. As of the fiscal year 2023-24, the new tax regime is the default option. Consequently, individuals seeking tax deductions under Section 80C must opt for the old tax regime since this deduction isn't available in the new tax regime. It's crucial for taxpayers to be aware of these rules to make informed decisions about their tax planning and investment strategies.","Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions.

Budget 2024 focuses on youth and women entrepreneurship,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/budget-2024-focuses-on-youth-and-women-entrepreneurship/articleshow/107357923.cms,"By

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget which is an interim budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year. The budget talks about inclusive development both, social and geographical, especially for youth, women, farmers, and the poor. Continued focus on improving logistics through infrastructure spend on roads, rail, airports, ports increases productivity for companies and citizens alike.To make ‘Viksit Bharat’ by 2047, the government’s focus is on improving and empowering people’s capabilities through various skilling initiatives. It is encouraging to see that Skill India Mission has succeeded in training more than 1.4 crore youth and upskilling and reskilling 54 lakh youth. I am particularly happy to see the continued focus on youth and women entrepreneurship and the announcement of a new fund which will give interest free 50 year loans for startups will provide a domestic fillip to startups supplementing venture capital we have traditionally relied on from abroad.PM Mudra Yojana has sanctioned 43 crore loans aggregating to 22.5 lakh crore to youth entrepreneurs and thirty crore Mudra Yojana loans to women entrepreneurs. There are several other schemes like Fund of Funds, Start-Up India, and Start-Up Credit Guarantee schemes that are assisting our youth. Further, the extension of tax benefits to Start-ups and investments made by sovereign wealth funds/pension funds, till 31st March 2025 depicts the government’s effort to support the startup eco- system.This aligns quite well with India Sanitation Coalition’s efforts to give impetus to the start-up world. Over the past 7 editions of our ISC-FICCI Sanitation Awards, we have recognized and promoted several start-ups in the sanitation space, many of whom are successful businesses now!While the finance minister did not provide detailed information on Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH), the budget allocation sees a slight increase in spend demonstrating continued focus on this highly successful program. The acknowledgement that the private sector has increasingly played a substantial role in addressing WASH issues in both urban and rural areas, with numerous projects underway through Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs), highlights the government's commitment to addressing challenges in this sector.A perfect example is the LightHouse Initiative initiated by the Department of Drinking Water along with the India Sanitation Coalition (ISC) by partnering with major corporates across India to develop model villages in Solid and Liquid Waste Management (SLWM) under SBM-Grameen. From this budget, there is an expectation that the government will persist in prioritizing Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) as the path toward achieving the country's Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6). Additionally, it is hoped that the government will uphold its commitment to making necessary infrastructural investments for SLWM.The budget speech rightly celebrates the fact that we have 83 lakh SHGs and 9 crore women beneficiaries. The microfinance movement in the country and the possibility of empowering women members of SHGs through livelihood skilling is a key to bringing women into mainstream economic advancement.The focus on green growth, rooftop solar, wind, biomass, e-vehicles all help with our green energy thrust. The tourism sector was mentioned and could be a huge job provider for youth and women.Guided by the principle ‘Reform, Perform, and Transform’, the budget emphasizes efficient implementation of various policies by improving coordination with states and relevant stakeholders. This is critical both for infra spend and social programsIt is noteworthy that ISC’s Climate Resilient Coastal Cities project which is being implemented in PPP (Public-Private Partnership) mode in four coastal states of Karnataka, Gujarat, Goa and Maharashtra is congruent with the government’s priority of promoting climate-resilient activities for the blue economy 2.0, a scheme for restoration and adaptation measures, and coastal aquaculture.The budget also focuses on the Aspirational districts program where assistance will be given to the states for faster development of aspirational districts and blocks, including the generation of ample economic opportunities. This is again very crucial as it has a huge potential to transform the landscape of our country while making sure no -one is left behind.Overall, this budget has embraced economic strategies and develops the building blocks that nurture and uphold growth, promote inclusive and sustainable development, and enhance productivity.","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year.

A noticeable aspect of the data is the dominance of the 18-25 age group, constituting a significant 56.36% of the total new members added in February 2024 indicating the majority of individuals joining the organized workforce are youth, primarily first-time job seekers.The payroll data highlights that approximately 11.78 lakh members exited and subsequently rejoined EPFO.These members switched their jobs and re-joined the establishments covered under the ambit of EPFO and opted to transfer their accumulations instead of applying for final settlement thus, safeguarding long-term financial well-being and extending their social security protection.Gender-wise analysis of payroll data unveils that out of 7.78 lakh new members, around 2.05 lakh are new female members. Also, the net female member addition during the month stood at around 3.08 lakh. The female member addition is indicative of a broader shift towards a more inclusive and diverse workforce.Month-on-month comparison of industry-wise data displays growth in the members working in establishments engaged in the industries viz. establishments engaged in manufacture, marketing servicing & usage of computers, companies/societies/assc/clubs/troupes for performances, road motor transport, automobile servicing, Textiles etc. Of the total net membership, around 41.53% addition is from expert services (consisting of manpower suppliers, normal contractors, security services, miscellaneous activities etc.).The above payroll data is provisional since the data generation is a continuous exercise, as updating employee records is a continuous process. The previous data hence gets updated every month. From the month of April-2018, EPFO has been releasing payroll data covering the period September, 2017 onwards. In monthly payroll data, the count of members joining the EPFO for the first time through Aadhaar validated Universal Account Number (UAN), existing members exiting from coverage of EPFO and those who exited but re-joining as members, is taken to arrive at net monthly payroll.","EPFO’s provisional payroll data released on 20April, 2024 shows that EPFO has added 15.48 lakh net members in the month of February, 2024.

Healthcare costs cause stress, even for individuals who earn well and have full medical coverage. Assume you have a Rs 15 lakh healthcare policy from XYZ insurer. However, after a year or two, you contracted a sickness, and the treatment expenditures, including pre, post, and in-hospitalisation, skyrocketed to Rs 20 lakh. When you see the bill, you remember you purchased another Rs 10 lakh coverage two years ago.Now, you might be wondering if you can utilise both health insurance plans together. Let's get an answer.The Insurance Regulatory Development Authority of India (IRDAI) permits you to raise medical claims through multiple insurers . To proceed, you must first inform all your insurance providers about the health plans you have in your name.Also, the claim must follow the IRDAI rules .Before we go any further, you need to pick a primary insurer with whom you want to raise a claim first. You should choose the one with whom you have a long-standing relationship.Another thing to note is that health insurance claims are classified into cashless and reimbursement. Let us look at both procedures one by one.Choose a network hospital where you want to be treated without having to pay any expenses upfront. You can find a nearby hospital by visiting your insurer's website and entering your city in the search box.The insurer will contact the third-party administrator to proceed with the pre-authorisation. They will check the cause for your admittance and confirm that the condition is covered under the policy and that you have cleared the waiting period.Following the completion of your treatment, the hospital authority will generate a bill, which the TPA will verify and send to the insurer’s claim department.Following satisfactory verification, the insurer will settle the cost up to the sum insured. You must remember to get the claim settlement summary.After this you must make a reimbursement claim with your secondary insurer for the remaining amount your primary healthcare plan has failed to cover because of the sum insured limit. You must attach the claim settlement summary and the attested medical bills when raising a claim.You can opt for reimbursement claims to get treatment at any non-network hospital.

Deductions that can be claimed under old tax regime

New Tax Regime Vs Old Tax Regime: Selecting the most tax-efficient income tax regime, either the old or new, can be a challenging decision for many salaried taxpayers. The optimal choice depends on the amount of deductions from gross total income that can be claimed to reduce the taxable income. If the gross total income and the minimum amount of deductions at which the tax liability would be the same under both the new tax regime and the old tax regime were known, the decision would be straightforward.When deductions exceed this minimum threshold, the old tax regime would be more advantageous, while the new tax regime would result in lower taxes if the deductions fall below this level.When determining the tax regime for TDS on salary, taxpayers typically use estimated figures for gross total income and proposed deductions. However, once the financial year concludes and the final income and deduction figures are available, precise calculations must be performed before selecting an income tax regime while filing the income tax return. Taxpayers can change the tax regime chosen by them earlier at the time of filing income tax return, provided they file within the deadline. Also, one very important point to note is that the new income tax regime is now the default tax regime, so if you don’t tell your employer your preferred regime, the tax will be deducted as per the new tax regime.The income tax laws under the new tax regime underwent revisions effective from April 1, 2023, and remain unchanged for the current FY, 2024-25 (April 1, 2024-March 31, 2025). The new tax regime offers a basic income exemption limit of Rs 3 lakh for all taxpayers and introduces additional income tax slabs with reduced tax rates.Also Read | Old vs New Income Tax Regime for TDS on salary: Will post-election Budget 2024 impact your choice? Under the new tax regime, salaried individuals are entitled to two deductions: a standard deduction of Rs 50,000 from their salary or pension income, and an employer's contribution to their NPS account, which can be up to 10% of their salary (or 14% of the basic salary for government employees), states an ET report.When comparing the tax regimes, it's crucial to note that the minimum deductions required to equalize the tax outgo in both regimes vary depending on the income level. Individuals with different gross taxable incomes, such as Rs 8 lakh and Rs 12 lakh, will need to claim different total deductions in the old tax regime to make the tax payable equal in both regimes. If an individual's actual total deduction in the old tax regime falls below this break-even level, the new tax regime becomes more advantageous.To illustrate this point, ET considers the example of two individuals, A and B, with gross taxable incomes of Rs 8 lakh and Rs 12 lakh, respectively. Both can claim a deduction of Rs 2.5 lakh in a financial year, which includes a standard deduction of Rs 50,000.The above table shows that for Mr A with gross taxable income of Rs 8 lakh, the final tax amount payable is lower in the old tax regime if the total deduction of Rs 2.5 lakh is claimed.However, despite the same deduction amount, Mr B with a gross taxable income of Rs 12 lakh will find the tax outgo lower in the new tax regime. The old tax regime will be favourable for a person with taxable income of Rs 12 lakh only if more deductions are claimed.Under the old tax regime, individuals can avail various deductions from their gross total income and claim tax exemptions. Both salaried and non-salaried individuals can claim deductions of up to Rs 1.5 lakh under Section 80C by making specified investments and expenditures. These include investing in Employees' Provident Fund (EPF), Public Provident Fund (PPF), ELSS mutual fund, repayment of principal of home loan and payment of children's tuition fees.Also Read | New versus Old regime: Does opting for the old income tax regime for TDS on salary make ITR processing, refunds easier? In addition to Section 80C, individuals can claim an extra deduction of Rs 50,000 for investments made in the National Pension System (NPS) according to specified rules, bringing the total deduction to Rs 2 lakh. Deductions can also be claimed for health insurance premium payments, with the amount varying based on the individual's age and whether the policy covers their parents.Furthermore, individuals can claim a deduction of Rs 2 lakh for interest paid on a home loan during the financial year, while interest paid on an education loan is eligible for deduction under Section 80E without any monetary limit. Savings account interest is eligible for deduction under Section 80TTA, and senior citizens can claim a deduction of Rs 50,000 under Section 80TTB for interest earned from various deposits, including savings accounts and fixed deposits.","The income tax laws under the new tax regime underwent revisions effective from April 1, 2023. salaried individuals are entitled to two deductions: a standard deduction of Rs 50,000 from their salary or pension income, and an employer's contribution to their NPS account, which can be up to 10% of their salary.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109474362,imgsize-22570,width-400,resizemode-4/109474362.jpg"

Italy survives S&P scrutiny of Giorgia Meloni’s worsened debt trajectory,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/italy-survives-sp-scrutiny-of-giorgia-melonis-worsened-debt-trajectory/articleshow/109473623.cms,"Italy’s credit status remains intact at S&P Global Ratings, which enacted the first major scrutiny on a worsened trajectory for debt foreseen by Premier Giorgia Meloni ’s government.In a statement on Friday, the company listed the euro zone’s third-biggest economy as one of the sovereigns that it had just reviewed without issuing any analysis.The country is still assessed at BBB, or two notches above junk, with a stable outlook that signals it isn’t in imminent danger of a downgrade.This was the first in this year’s assessments by major ratings companies on Italy’s credit status, and the judgment took on some significance after the government’s implicit acknowledgment this month that its debt-cutting efforts have not only stalled, but look likely to go into reverse.The S&P decision keeps Italy out of the spotlight after a period of calm for the country in financial markets. Earlier this year, the extra yield paid for Italian debt over German equivalents fell to a two-year low.That partly reflected the restraint for the public finances that Meloni’s coalition has preached since coming to power in late 2022, all while treading a fine line that still allowed for some fiscal loosening.The strategy has paid off until now, with Moody’s even removing its threat of a cut to junk.Italy’s fiscal position has been eroded however by the impact of rising interest rates and economic weakness in neighbors such as Germany.Just this week, the International Monetary Fund made its own prediction that a period of post-pandemic debt reduction has ended for the country, with its borrowings now set to rise over the next half decade.The government’s recently published forecasts acknowledged a change in direction too. They indicate Italy’s debt pile will peak at 139.8% of output in 2026, while the IMF reckons that it will breach 140% as soon as next year.Those projections by the treasury were based on a far rosier outlook for economic growth this year, anticipating 1% expansion, compared with 0.6% seen by both the Bank of Italy and many private-sector forecasters.The government numbers didn’t reflect potential legislation, because Italy is transitioning to a new system of fiscal oversight by European Union authorities. More detailed figures won’t be published until September, after the upcoming EU elections.That timetable may tempt Meloni to delay tough decisions such as whether to cancel promised tax cuts or aid to companies and citizens until the vote is over.

World Bank and IMF meetings conclude without concrete plan to mobilize trillions for climate change,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/world-bank-and-imf-meetings-conclude-without-concrete-plan-to-mobilize-trillions-for-climate-change/articleshow/109472712.cms,"NEW DELHI: The World Bank and IMF meetings concluded without a definitive strategy to secure the necessary funds for combating climate change, a crucial issue for the upcoming COP29 conference in Azerbaijan. The New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG), which determines the annual financial support developed countries must provide to developing nations from 2025 onwards, will be a central topic at the conference.Despite repeated failures, wealthy nations are anticipated to contribute more than the previously committed USD 100 billion per year from 2020.Recent data shows that financial inflows to developing countries turned negative in 2023, with these nations paying more in debt servicing than they received in external financing. Discussions among G7 and G20 finance ministers during the spring meetings focused on providing financial support to developing countries for achieving climate and development goals. The Vulnerable Group of Twenty Countries (V20) urged increased concessional finance for climate-vulnerable nations and called on G7 and high-emitting G21 countries to protect the 1.5 degrees Celsius limit. The Intergovernmental Group of Twenty-Four on International Monetary Affairs and Development (G24) advocated for reforms to ensure timely assistance to vulnerable nations and urged changes to theG20 Common Framework to support countries in debt distress.World Bank president Ajay Banga expressed optimism that donor contributions could provide an additional USD 100 billion to the poorest countries through the International Development Association (IDA). The Bank had previously launched an initiative to increase financing for low-income countries through low-cost financing and grants, with shareholders expected to pledge to the IDA before the replenishment conference in December. While Banga reaffirmed the Bank's commitment to increasing climate-aligned finance, he stated that the Bank has no intention of halting investments in gas projects.IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva highlighted that the global economy had lost USD 3.3 trillion since 2020, with the poorest countries spending over 14 percent of their budgets on debt payments, exacerbated by rising interest rates. A report by the Debt Relief for Green and Inclusive Recovery Project (DRGR) revealed that 47 emerging and developing market economies may be unable to allocate necessary funds for climate adaptation and development without risking default in the next five years.Discussions on international taxation for climate action took place, with the International Tax Task Force launching its first phase of work to assist countries in fulfilling their Paris Agreement commitments. The task force, co-chaired by Kenya, Barbados, and France, aims to explore options for international levies to raise revenues for combating climate change and supporting development and nature. Finance ministers of Brazil and France led discussions on a wealth tax of at least 2 percent of billionaires' wealth annually, which could raise USD 250 billion to address poverty, hunger, and climate change. The IMF endorsed the proposal, which is being supported by the Brazilian G20 presidency.Pepukaye Bardouille, Director of Bridgetown Initiative and Special Adviser on Climate Resilience, Barbados Prime Minister's Office, acknowledged progress in recent months but emphasized the USD 3 trillion funding gap for achieving sustainable development goals and addressing the climate crisis. Bardouille stressed the need for countries from the Global South to speak up more to ensure that funds reach those who need them most, calling for the tripling of IDA by 2030, concessional 50-year loans for low-income and vulnerable middle-income countries, and new funding streams from the wealthiest and most polluting sectors.Rachel Kyte, Professor of Practice in Climate Policy, Blavatnik School of Government, Oxford University, highlighted the growing net outflows of finance from emerging markets and developing countries, exacerbating the challenges posed by climate change. Kyte emphasized the need for shareholders to do more to support these nations in their efforts to overcome these obstacles.","The World Bank and IMF meetings concluded without a definitive strategy to secure the necessary funds for combating climate change.

Volkswagen's Tennessee workers vote to join UAW trade union,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/volkswagens-tennessee-workers-vote-to-join-uaw-trade-union/articleshow/109470281.cms,"Wage deals with 'Big Three,' Biden on Detroit picket

Workers at German car giant Volkswagen 's Chattanooga factory in Tennessee have voted to join the United Auto Workers trade union, in a major boost for the largest car union in the US outside its powerbase in Detroit.Well over half of eligible workers cast ballots, making the result binding.And of those who voted, 2,628 were in favor and 985 against, a 73% level of support for unionizing.Workers celebrated the result, cheering and waving their ""Union Yes"" campaign posters as the outcome was announced late on Friday.Even President Joe Biden commented on the results, having voiced support for the move in the run-up.""Together, these union wins have helped raise wages and demonstrate once again that the middle-class built America and that unions are still building and expanding the middle class for all workers,"" he said in a statement.Union presence rare in US South and WestFriday's result will make Chattanooga the first auto plant in the South to unionize via an election since the 1940s, and the first foreign-owned plant in the South to do so.VW held a neutral posture in the vote, with unionization the norm at its facilities around the world, including in its native Germany. It used to have a UAW presence at its defunct plant in Pennsylvania far to the north, until that closed in 1988. So the vote appears more likely to lead to a deal rather than deadlock.UAW President Shawn Fain has been trying to extend the influence of the US' main car workers' union beyond the historic automotive capital of Detroit where it's focused.Fain and his team have committed to spending more than $40 million (€37.5 million) through 2026 in a bid to unionize plants owned by a variety of carmakers in other parts of the US, including Tesla.""I'm exhilarated that we actually accomplished what set out to accomplish,"" VW employee Lisa Elliott said after the results were announced. ""Tell Mercedes they're next.""That was a reference to a Mercedes plant in Alabama, which will be the next facility to hold a UAW election during the week of May 13.It was the third attempt to affiliate with UAW at the factory, with votes in 2014 and 2019 narrowly failing. Other votes at other factories, like a Nissan facility in Mississippi in 2017, also failed.But this year's vote had coincided with a boost in public support for unions in the US, which can be fairly skeptical of organized labor by international standards.Republican governors in six southern states, including Tennessee, have spoken out against the move to unionize car plants in recent months.The UAW last year securing big pay settlements with the ""Big Three"" US carmakers — General Motors, Ford and Stellantis (more commonly still called Chrysler) — after President Biden walked a Detroit picket line also brought the group into public focus.The union has indicated it is also eyeing a Hyundai factory in Alabama and a Toyota facility in Missouri where it says that more than 30% of staff have already signed cards indicating they want a vote on joining.","VW workers in Tennessee vote to join United Auto Workers trade union.

Bitcoin Halving 2024: 'Halving' arrives for bitcoin miners,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/halving-arrives-for-bitcoin-miners/articleshow/109464006.cms,"Controlling supply

Reduced margins

NEW YORK: The bitcoin market on Friday engineered the ""halving"" of the reward for operating the cryptocurrency , a much-anticipated step designed to limit production and boost the digital money.""The 4th #Bitcoin halving is complete!,"" announced cryptocurrency exchange Binance on X, the former Twitter.""The countdown has been reset -- see you in 2028.""Bitcoin is created as a reward when computers solve complex puzzles to decide which miner wins the privilege to validate the block -- and receive the reward in bitcoins.However, since the digital currency's launch in 2009, the reward has been halved for every 210,000 blocks in a process called halving.With one block validated roughly every ten minutes, this critical industry event occurs just under every four years.The reward, which was fixed since May 2020 at 6.25 bitcoins per new block, has now fallen to 3.125 bitcoins.Bitcoin was conceived in 2008 by a person or group writing under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto.The halving process slows the rate at which new bitcoins are created, thereby restricting supply .The reward amount has been trimmed over time, via halving, to implement Nakamoto's overall global limit of 21 million bitcoins.But this ceiling is due to be reached by 2040.""The primary purpose of halving is to control bitcoin's supply,"" City Index analyst Matthew Weller said in a research note ahead of the event.""By slowing the rate at which new bitcoins are created, halving helps to maintain scarcity and potentially increase the cryptocurrency's value , assuming demand remains steady or increases,"" he added.The price of bitcoin has blazed a record-breaking trail on the prospect of reduced supplies, as well as big moves toward greater trading accessibility.Bitcoin has rocketed by 50 percent in value since the start of the year, climaxing last month at a record $73,797. Prices have fallen in recent days.""This is the first time that bitcoin beat the previous historical record before the halving has even taken place,"" said eToro analyst Simon Peters, noting there had been a pullback in recent days.Commercial bitcoin mining companies operate thousands of computers in huge hangers or warehouses, consuming large amounts of electricity at a vast cost.Halving therefore represents a major survival test for such companies because it slashes their main income source.Faced with the prospect of reduced margins, bitcoin players have invested heavily in cutting-edge new computers, in tandem with an efficiency drive which in particular seeks to slash energy costs.In addition, some mining companies will have to ""turn off some of their machines to cut costs, which equates to fewer bitcoins being created,"" said Manuel Valente, founder of cryptoasset investment group Coinhouse.""And if the price of bitcoin goes down, their profitability decreases"" further, he told AFP.Halving therefore exposes the weakest bitcoin mining firms, and could potentially spark a fresh wave of sector consolidation in a survival of the fittest, commentators say.At around 0030 GMT, after the halving had taken place, the price of bitcoin was up 0.7 percent at $63,467.46.","The ""halving"" of the reward for operating the cryptocurrency bitcoin has taken place.

US debt: Worsening US government debt outlook seen more in gold and bitcoin than in bonds,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/worsening-us-debt-outlook-seen-more-in-gold-and-bitcoin-than-in-bonds/articleshow/109463986.cms,"Concern about the rapidly rising US government debt is partly behind recent surges in gold prices and bitcoin , even as the Treasury market so far remains relatively sanguine about the country's fiscal path , market observers say.The US budget deficit widened to $1.7 trillion in fiscal year 2023 and is on track to reach $2.6 trillion by 2034, according to the Congressional Budget Office.US government debt held by the public, meanwhile, is on pace to reach a record 106% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2028, up from 97% in fiscal year 2023. It has soared to $27 trillion from $17 trillion in early 2020 and $5 trillion in 2007.The unchecked growth of US government debt is gaining more attention as interest rate payments also take a larger bite of the government's budget - in some months exceeding spending on national defense.This worsening trajectory has boosted demand for bitcoin and gold, which are often used as a hedge against inflation and the depreciating purchasing power of the US currency.“Concerns about the US debt cycle, devaluation of money - and fiat money in particular - does drive the story and the narrative,” said Brad Bechtel, global head of FX at Jefferies.That “at the margin pushes investors to allocate more towards something like (bitcoin) than they otherwise would,” and for gold “it’s even bigger there,” Bechtel said. “Concerns about debasing of fiat money is generally one of the drivers of the gold bugs.Yields in Treasury debt largely reflect expectations of Federal Reserve interest rate policy. At times they are swayed by increases in debt supply, though the longer-term fiscal trajectory is less of a factor in the market.The US central bank has intermittently purchased Treasuries in an effort to stimulate growth, which can pull yields lower and increase the supply of dollars.Supply disruptions, record government spending and ultra loose monetary policy as businesses were shut down for Covid in 2020 led to soaring prices pressures that have still not completely abated.“There’s interest in both gold and bitcoin because of that, because inflation’s been unsteady in the last couple of years,” said Lawrence H. White, professor of economics at George Mason Univer sity.More concerning is that the rising debt and deficit “is in peace time with an economy that’s running at full employment… that’s normally when you should be running surpluses and we’re not even close,” White said. “So, in the next recession we’re going to have an even bigger jump up in debt.”Certainly there are other major factors driving the interest in bitcoin and gold.Bitcoin has been buoyed by new exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that invest in the cryptocurrency, drawing in more investors. It is also approaching a halving, when the rewards from mining bitcoin are cut by 50%.That has traditionally been bullish for bitcoin, said Bechtel. Bitcoin reached a record $73,803 in March.The gold surge is also being driven by expectations of central bank rate cuts and purchases by foreign central banks diversifying their reserves. This is partly due to inflation concerns , and also a way to protect against possible US sanctions in a geopolitical dispute.Gold hit a record $2,431 per ounce last week.But the rapidly worsening US fiscal situation remains a key driver for some investors.Michael Hartnett, investment strategist at Bank of America, said in a recent report that recent highs in gold and tech stocks are indicating that the “parlous state of US govt finances"" will inevitably lead to policies including yield curve control “to prevent (a) debt crisis.”In yield curve control a central bank buys bonds in order to maintain a target interest rate, which can reduce government borrowing costs.So far, however, several Treasury market indicators show that bonds are not pricing in a worsening fiscal outlook, said Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research.These include 10-year Treasury yields trading well below those on three-month notes. Real 10-year yields, which “reflect all risks other than future inflation,” are also around the same level as from 2003–2007, when the debt to GDP ratio was half of what it is now.Treasury investors ""still see the dollar as the reserve currency, they still see Treasuries as relatively safe and there’s enough Treasuries out there to put money to work,” Colas said. “If you’re looking for risk free assets in size the Treasury market’s still the place to go.”",US budget deficit widened to $1.7 trillion in fiscal year 2023 and is on track to reach $2.6 trillion by 2034.

Pakistan government borrows PKR 650 billion amid economic crisis,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/pakistan-government-borrows-pkr-650-billion-amid-economic-crisis/articleshow/109462361.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Pakistan government borrowed more than PKR 650 billion from banks to address its increasing expenses within a week, as reported by Dawn on Saturday.The government's borrowing from commercial banks hit a historic high of PKR 5.5 trillion from July 1, 2023, to April 5, 2024 against PKR 2.95 billion in the same period of the previous fiscal year, as per data from the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP).The economy is being heavily burdened by this extensive borrowing, as domestic debts leave no room for revenue allocation apart from interest payments . According to Dawn, the government is expected to allocate over half of the total budget towards interest payments.In the fiscal year 2023, the government took loans amounting to PKR 3.7 trillion from banks. However, the present scenario appears concerning, with the government surpassing the previous year's amount by PKR 1.784 trillion in the initial nine months.It is common for the government to heavily borrow from banks in the final quarter of a fiscal year to present a more favorable depiction of economic performance.As per the Pakistan-based news daily, the economy is facing significant challenges internally and externally. The majority of the revenue generated is allocated towards servicing domestic debt and interest. This substantial outflow restricts the government from initiating new development programs; instead, a significant portion of the development funds are reallocated to other sectors.The scenario is more dire on the external front, where borrowing is challenging due to Pakistan's diminished repayment capacity. Pakistan requires assistance from the IMF to enhance its reputation among foreign investors. However, the government has faced obstacles in borrowing from international markets over the past two years.Financial experts have stated that the new agreement with the IMF could potentially 'open a window for Pakistan to borrow from the international market.' They also emphasize that 'time is required to sustain growth and remove major reasons for uncertainties.'According to analysts' estimates, the current borrowing from banks may reach up to PKR 7 trillion by the conclusion of June 2024. A report from Dawn highlights that 'the government has been increasing energy prices but has not generated enough revenue to meet its expenditures.'","The government's borrowing from commercial banks hit a historic high of PKR 5.5 trillion from July 1, 2023, to April 5, 2024.

"After VW plant victory, UAW sets its sights on Mercedes in Alabama",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/after-vw-plant-victory-uaw-sets-its-sights-on-mercedes-in-alabama/articleshow/109461579.cms,"CHATTANOOGA: The United Auto Workers has made history by winning its first unionization vote at an auto factory in the US South . Now it needs to prove the success wasn't a fluke by pulling off a second victory at a Mercedes plant in Alabama next month.UAW representatives at the VW plant also will have to show their mettle by negotiating a contract that gives workers what they have fought for - better benefits, improved safety on the job and a greater work-life balance.The Volkswagen landslide win in Tennessee is expected to provide crucial momentum to UAW President Shawn Fain's $40 million campaign to expand the union outside Detroit to the US South and West, focusing on 13 non-union auto companies, including Toyota and Tesla.Fain, a scrappy leader who reveled in last year's fight with Detroit companies that won double-digit raises and cost-of-living adjustments, told a party of VW workers that the union would carry the fight on to Mercedes. ""Let's win more for the working class all over this nation,"" he said.The Mercedes plant vote, scheduled for mid-May, is expected to be a tougher fight than at VW, which took a neutral position in the vote.Mercedes has said it respects workers' right to organize and wants them to make an informed decision. But in a letter to employees in January, it said that the union organizers ""cannot guarantee you anything"" and that some workers had said no to unionization because of Mercedes' competitive pay and benefits.""Mercedes is running a much more aggressive anti-union campaign than Volkswagen within the plant,"" said John Logan, labor professor at San Francisco State University.But he added that the large VW victory that saw 73% of eligible workers vote in favor will provide significant momentum for organizing efforts at other plants in the South.""This will give them a huge boost for the Mercedes vote, and if they win that one, too, I wouldn't be surprised to see elections at Hyundai, Honda and Toyota over the next several months,"" he said.The UAW says a ""supermajority"" of the roughly 5,200 eligible workers at the Mercedes assembly plant in Vance, Alabama, and a nearby battery plant in Woodstock support it. UAW policy is to push for a vote once 70% of workers have signed union cards.Much may depend on economics and perceptions about job security. In the traditionally anti-union South where the UAW has lost several fights in the past, six Republican governors have flatly opposed the union's current campaign, describing it as risking job security since automakers face higher labor costs.Prior to last autumn's UAW labor talks with the Detroit Three automakers, Ford officials said their US labor costs were $64 an hour, compared with an estimated $55 for foreign automakers and $45-$50 for electric vehicle leader Tesla.Workers at two other plants in the US South - a Hyundai plant in Alabama and a Toyota parts factory in Missouri - have also launched organizing campaigns, with 30% of employees signing cards saying they support the UAW.Workers at the VW plant say they will kick off meetings on Sunday to strategize on contract negotiations.""The real fight is getting your fair share,"" Fain told VW workers Friday night.VW worker Jeremy Bowman, who hopes to be on the plant's organizing committee, agreed. ""The fight is just starting,"" he said.","The United Auto Workers has made history by winning its first unionization vote at an auto factory in the US South.

‘Regular flight schedules restored today; our response far from perfect:’ Emirates president Tim Clark,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/regular-flight-schedules-restored-today-our-response-far-from-perfect-emirates-president-tim-clark/articleshow/109455739.cms,"NEW DELHI: Mega carrier Emirates is restoring regular flights from Saturday (April 20), days after unprecedented rains lashed the UAE — especially Dubai — this Monday. Dubai Airports had temporarily limited the number of inbound flights to fix affected systems. All airlines’ schedules to and from Dubai have been severely impacted since Monday.“As of this morning, Saturday April 20, our regular flight schedules have been restored.Passengers previously stranded in the airport transit area have been rebooked and are enroute to their destinations. We have put together a task force to sort, reconcile, and deliver some 30,000 pieces of left-behind baggage to their owners. It will take us some more days to clear the backlog of rebooked passengers and bags, and we ask for our customers’ patience and understanding,” Emirates president Tim Clark said in an open letter.He acknowledged that Emirates’s “response has been far from perfect. We acknowledge and understand the frustration of our customers due to the congestion, lack of information, and confusion in the terminals. We acknowledge that the long queues and wait times have been unacceptable.”Emirates is the largest foreign airline in terms of operations to and from India. On a standalone basis, it is the third largest airline for flying passengers in and out of India after IndiGo and Air India. DGCA data shows in October-December 2023 India had 1.7 crore international passengers (arriving and departing) of which Emirates carried 8.1% or roughly 13.8 lakh. So on an average over 15,000 people fly Emirates daily between Indian cities and DXB, with a significant number of them being transiting via Dubai International. Apart from point-to-point travellers, Dubai also sees a lot of transfer traffic between India and rest of the world on Emirates' flights.The UAE received its heaviest rainfall in last 75 years this week. “This week has been one of the toughest for Emirates operationally, as record storms hit the United Arab Emirates. I would like to offer our most sincere apologies to every customer who has had their travel plans disrupted during this time,” Tim Clark's letter says.“On Tuesday, April 16, the UAE experienced its highest rainfall in 75 years… Our 24/7 hub in Dubai remained open, with flight movements reduced for safety, but flooded roads impeded the ability of our customers, pilots, cabin crew, and airport employees to reach the airport, and also the movement of essential supplies like meals and other flight amenities. We diverted dozens of flights to avoid the worst of the weather on Tuesday, and over the next three days we had to cancel nearly 400 flights and delay many more, as our hub operations remained challenged by staffing and supply shortages,” Clarks’ letter says.He details how the airline, along with the airport, tried to get things back on track. “To free up resources and capacity to manage impacted customers as a priority, we had to suspend check-in for passengers departing Dubai; implement an embargo on ticket sales and temporarily halt connecting passenger traffic from points across our network coming into Dubai. We deployed additional resources to aid our airport and contact centre teams with rebooking and put on additional flights to destinations where we identified large numbers of displaced customers.”“We sent over 100 employee volunteers to look after disrupted customers at Dubai Airport departures and in the transit area, prioritising medical cases, the elderly and other vulnerable travellers. To date, over 12,000 hotel rooms were secured to accommodate disrupted customers in Dubai, 250,000 meal vouchers have been issued, and more quantities of drinking water, blankets, and other amenities.","Emirates is the largest foreign airline in terms of operations to and from India.
