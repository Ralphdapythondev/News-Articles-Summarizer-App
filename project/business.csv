"Stock market crash today: BSE Sensex ends 733 points down; Nifty50 goes below 22,500",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/stock-market-today-bse-sensex-nifty50-may-3-2024-dalal-street-indian-equities-global-markets/articleshow/109801756.cms,"Why BSE Sensex, Nifty50 crashed today

Here are the key reasons that led to today's bloodbath:

Stock market crash today: BSE Sensex and Nifty50 , the Indian equity benchmark indices, tanked in trade on Friday, despite a strong opening and the Nifty reaching a new all-time high. Selling pressure from index heavyweights Reliance Industries (RIL) and HDFC Bank led to the crash on Dalal Street . The S&P BSE Sensex dropped by 1,126 points or 1.5% to reach a low of 73,627.99, and the broader Nifty 50 fell by 289 points to touch a low of 22,358.65.All sectoral indices experienced declines in trading.BSE Sensex closed the day at 73,878.15, down 733 points or 0.98%. Nifty50 ended the day at 22,475.85, down 172 points or 0.76%. The market capitalization of companies listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange also decreased significantly by Rs 4.25 lakh crore when Sensex tanked 1,100 points.The fear gauge India VIX also increased by 11% to nearly 15, marking its 7th consecutive rise.""I feel geopolitical tension would make headlines again giving traders an option to go short on markets. Overall, the Q4 earnings are ranging from neutral to positive and are not particularly impressive. There are some reports indicating that Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) have decreased their holdings in large-cap stocks such as HDFC Bank and ITC. In the short term, the trend remains cautious, with the focus shifting towards new geopolitical developments. Hence, we advise traders to remain light on positions,"" said Prashanth Tapse of Mehta Equities.1. RIL and HDFC Banks led the market downfall. The Indian markets lost their morning gains and dropped to the day's low due to the decline in RIL, L&T, HDFC Bank, and Bharti Airtel, among others. These stocks had the most significant impact on the headline indices in terms of their contribution to the respective indices.2. India VIX, which is a measure of volatility, increased by more than 12% to 15.12 due to various factors affecting market sentiments such as Q4 earnings, the ongoing election season, and the delay in the US Fed's interest rate cut.Commenting on the day's action, Amit Goel, Co-Founder & Chief Global Strategist, Pace 360 said that the volatility of the Indian stock market has increased in the last few weeks owing to a combination of both global and domestic factors.""Globally, speculation surrounding the timing and magnitude of the season's first Fed rate cut, along with selling pressure from FIIs in emerging markets, plays a pivotal role. The NFP data from the US expected later today is also a factor in today's volatility,"" Goel added.3. In its policy for May, the Federal Reserve recognized that there has been limited advancement towards achieving its inflation target and emphasized the uncertainty surrounding the inflation trajectory. Markets expect US interest rates to stay higher for longer and are pricing in just one rate cut in 2024, said Rajani Sinha, Chief Economist, CareEdge Ratings. The non-farm payroll data from the United States that is anticipated later today is also contributing to the volatility seen today.4. Higher-for-longer interest rates. The inflation trajectory in the US has delayed the timing and magnitude of the season's first Fed rate cut. Investors are now starting to question if the Fed will be able to implement any rate cuts at all in the year 2024 due to the recent disappointing progress in reducing inflation.5. Market speculations related to the outcome of the Lok Sabha election results are also causing increased volatility. Analysts predict that volatility may increase even more as we approach the election results date of 4th June.","BSE Sensex and Nifty50 tanked in trade on Friday.

The fear gauge India VIX also increased by 11% to nearly 15, marking its 7th consecutive rise.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109802195,imgsize-149428,width-400,resizemode-4/109802195.jpg"

When will gold prices hit Rs 2 lakh mark? Here’s what experts say,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/investing/when-will-gold-prices-hit-rs-2-lakh-mark-heres-what-experts-say/articleshow/109750709.cms,"Gold Prices Outlook:

Gold prices: What should investors do?

Gold has been a cherished asset for Indian households, consistently delivering impressive returns compared to other investment options. Even as gold prices touch new highs this year, one wonders when the yellow metal will hit levels of Rs 1 lakh, or even Rs 2 lakh? What does historical data on the movement of gold suggest and what should investors do?Gold prices have nearly tripled over the past 9 years, rising from Rs 24,740 in 2015.This follows a similar pattern observed in the previous 9-year period, when the price tripled from Rs 8,250 in 2006. Going back further, it took approximately 19 years for the gold price to triple from Rs 2,570 per 10 g in 1987, preceded by tripling cycles of around 8 years and 6 years, states an ET report by Naveen Kumar.If the price continues to triple from its current level, gold could surpass the Rs 2 lakh per 10 gram mark. However, investors are keen to know how long it will take for the price to reach this milestone. Here is what experts have to say on future returns and timeline for gold to hit the Rs 2 lakh level:Gold prices are sensitive to global events, such as geopolitical tensions and economic crises, which can cause rapid increases in relatively short periods. In the past 5 years, factors like rupee weakness, geopolitical issues, the pandemic, and war have contributed to a 75% increase in gold prices, from Rs 40,000 to over Rs 7,00,000, in just 3.3 years. In contrast, from 2014 to 2018, gold prices only increased by 12%, from Rs 28,000 to Rs 31,250.Also Read | Important updates for NPS subscribers: New charges and security measures announced by PFRDA Jateen Trivedi, VP Research Analyst at LKP Securities, states, ""Historical data shows that major global changes, such as geopolitical tensions and economic crises, can significantly influence gold prices, leading to rapid increases within relatively short periods. The recent past of 5 years has shown rupee weakness as well as geopolitical issues and pandemic and war. All these together have given gold a spurt from Rs 40,000 to Rs 7,00,00+ — a gain of 75% in a matter of 3.3 years. In 2014, gold price was Rs 28,000 and in 2018 it was Rs 31,250, which is only 12% in a matter of 5 years.""Trivedi also suggests that gold prices could potentially reach Rs 2 lakh within the next 7-12 years, given recent trends.Some experts, like Surendra Mehta, National Secretary of the India Bullion and Jewellers Association, are even more optimistic about gold prices tripling and crossing Rs 2 lakh. Mehta believes that escalating geopolitical tensions between Iran and Israel after Ramzan, as well as China-Taiwan tensions, could bring uncertainty and lead to de-dollarisation. He predicts that these factors, along with heavy paper trading of gold in SGE and Comex, could cause gold prices to triple within the next 6 years.However, it's important to note that the tripling period for gold prices can vary significantly. Vikram Dhawan, Fund Manager and Head - Commodities at Nippon India Mutual Fund, points out that there has been an instance where the tripling period extended to almost 19 years. Dhawan reminds us that gold, like any other asset, is subject to bull and bear markets, leading to variable annual returns.He states, ""Like any other asset, gold is subject to bull and bear markets, leading to variable annual returns. However, as long as there is no better alternative, gold will continue to be in great demand from consumers and investors alike, hopefully rising to meet their return expectations.""Also Read | New mutual fund KYC rules: Is your KYC validated, verified, registered or on hold? Find out Gold is widely regarded as one of the most effective hedges against inflation. According to Harsh Gahlaut, Co-founder and CEO of FinEdge, ""Gold price is directly correlated to inflation. Inflation has been high across geographies and will take time to cool off. As long as inflation remains high, gold prices will continue to get support and see an upward trend in the future.""The trajectory of inflation will also play a crucial role in determining the pace at which gold prices increase. Hareesh V, Head of Commodities at Geojit Financial Services, explains, ""Inflation and gold prices often have a complex relationship. Gold is often seen as a hedge against inflation because its value tends to hold relatively steady or even increase during times of inflation.""In addition to inflation, various other factors also contribute to the fluctuations in gold prices. Dhawan elaborates, ""When inflation rates rise, the purchasing power of fiat currencies decreases, leading investors to turn to gold as a store of value, thus driving up its price. This relationship is complex and not always direct, as other economic factors can also impact gold prices during periods of high inflation.""The availability of gold has remained consistent, and any sudden increase in demand has the potential to drive prices higher in the short term. ""The total supply of gold is limited, which is the one reason the metal is considered a valuable asset. The supply of gold comes from two main sources — mining and recycling. The amount of new gold mined each year is relatively stable. The rest of the demand is usually met by recycling scrap gold,"" says Hareesh.The growing demand from central banks is expected to persist and may contribute to rising prices. ""There has been large-scale buying from some large central banks as they are considerably increasing their gold holdings — like Russia, China, India, etc. Since the supply of gold is limited, this increase in sovereign treasury holdings will continue to put pressure on supply and will support gold prices. We do not see the supply-side pressure easing in the near future as the risk of geopolitical conflicts does not seem to be easing,"" says Gahlaut.Also Read | Using a credit card? From usage beyond limit to overlimit fees - top queries answered based on RBI’s new FAQs While jewellery has traditionally been a significant driver of demand, it may not continue to play the same role in the future. However, the demand for bullion is anticipated to increase. ""I can see that in a country like India, gold is converting its orbit from consumption item to investment item at a much faster pace. So, sale of jewellery will keep dropping with improved sale of bullion due to financialisation of gold,"" says Mehta.The shifting dynamics of the global landscape may have a lasting effect on the trajectory of gold prices. Dhawan suggests, ""A decline in the credit rating of the US, whether actual or perceived, may propel gold into a multi-decade bull run. Re-globalisation leading to competitive currency devaluations, along with trade disputes, is conducive for gold prices. On the positive side, bigger and wealthier emerging economies that have a cultural affinity towards gold, like India, may lead to a material increase in gold consumption, underpinning the prices.""If the present situations persist or intensify, gold prices are expected to surge even higher. Gahlaut states, ""Any escalation of regional or global conflicts, outright wars breaking out, and dollar domination coming under pressure as a global currency can lead to a spike in gold prices. While returns from gold are not linear, gold will continue to play an important role as a risk reduction tool and as a hedge against inflation.""The implementation of ESG regulations could potentially cause a significant decrease in the supply of gold. Dhawan explains, ""The strict adoption of environmental, social & governance (ESG) rules worldwide is a threat to gold production. This is because gold mines are among the most expensive and most toxic places.""When considering whether to link your investment strategy to the rapid tripling of gold prices, it's essential to approach the decision with caution. ""In conclusion, the trajectory of gold prices will be shaped by a combination of economic indicators, geopolitical events, and market sentiment. While predicting exact price movements is challenging, the fundamental role of gold as a safe-haven asset suggests continued potential for growth in the future,"" says Trivedi.Incorporating gold into your investment portfolio can be a wise choice for diversification purposes. ""Diversifying investments and considering different assets, including gold, can help mitigate risks associated with inflation. During deflationary phases, gold tends to perform well compared to most asset classes,"" says Dhawan.Also Read | Mutual Fund KYC issues: What problems are MF investors facing with new rules and how they can check their KYC status However, it's crucial not to base your entire gold investment strategy solely on the expectation of its tripling potential. ""While it is impossible to predict how long gold will take to triple from the current level, it is important to note that as an asset class, gold plays a critical role as a hedge against inflation, volatility, geopolitical and currency risks and, therefore, will remain an important part of asset allocation in a person's portfolio,"" says Gahlaut.Investing in gold can be beneficial at any time when you are aiming to diversify your investment portfolio. Nevertheless, as the price of gold continues to rise, there may be opportunities to purchase gold during dips in the market. ""Higher prices may eventually lead to reactions from the supply side. However, as gold is under-owned and global gold ETF holdings are at a five-year low, pullbacks may bring in dip buying from investors. Moreover, central banks continue to be net buyers,"" says Dhawan.","Gold prices have nearly tripled over the past 9 years, rising from Rs 24,740 in 2015. If the price continues to triple from its current level, gold could surpass the Rs 2 lakh per 10 gram mark.

The notices were issued for suspected non-compliance with regulations related to related party transactions, listing rules, and the authenticity of auditor certificates.According to an ET report by Reena Zachariah, Adani Enterprises , the group's flagship entity, revealed that it had been served with two such notices during the first quarter of this year, which concluded on March 31.Similarly, other Adani Group companies, namely Adani Ports & Special Economic Zone, Adani Power , Adani Energy Solutions , Adani Wilmar and Adani Total Gas, also reported receiving show-cause notices from the market regulator earlier this week.These companies have stated that the show-cause notices issued by the Sebi are not expected to have a significant impact, according to the legal advice they have received.

We don't see much point in importing cars here. We want to continue our strategy to make cars in India, and our priority is not to import electric cars,"" Koskas said. The EV policy promises subsidised customs duty of 15% for companies to import their green models here, but only when they commit to invest a minimum of $500 million for a factory, apart from substantial local value addition.Citroen, that has followed group company Jeep into India, also said it sees India as a big opportunity for growth , though stiff competition from rivals and demanding customers are challenges ahead.""If you succeed in India, you can succeed anywhere in the world.

The finance minister set the stage for a ""Viksit Bharat by 2047"", on the core principles of ‘Sabka Saath’, ‘Sabka Vikas’, ‘Sabka Vishwas’, with ‘Sabka Prayas’ being added as a new theme in the interim Budget.This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data i.e., farmer welfare and N for Nari utthan i.e., support for women entrepreneurs.These form the pillars of a comprehensive inclusive development. The Government's commitment to sustainable development under the strategy for Amrit Kaal includes achieving 'Net Zero' by 2070, rooftop solarization for one crore households and robust health initiatives.The Indian economy's resilience takes center stage amidst positive indicators of declining current account deficit as a percentage of GDP, falling unemployment rates, and a notable rise in digital transactions. These statistics affirm the robustness of the economy, showcasing a trajectory of growth and stability.The achievements in taxation reforms are nothing short of remarkable, with direct tax collections more than trebling in the last decade, the number of tax return filers increasing by 2.4 times, average processing time of tax returns plummeting from 93 days in FY 2013-14 to an impressive 10 days in FY 2023-24, resulting in issuance of quick refunds. These are the results of consistent progressive measures thus obviating the need for, and rightly avoiding, any last-minute populist measures.No change in existing tax rates, both for direct and indirect taxes, is a good indicator of stability and predictability for investors and taxpayers.A welcome move to waive outstanding tax demands that are minor, disputed, and unreconciled. This involves the withdrawal of outstanding direct tax demands up to Rs. 25,000 pertaining to the period up to FY 2009-10 and up to Rs.10,000 for FY 2010-11 to 2014-15.The Government's commitment to fostering a business-friendly environment is evident in its intent to extend specific tax benefits for start-ups, investments by sovereign wealth funds/ pension funds, and certain IFSC units. The extension has been made now until March 31, 2025. This might help in creating a conducive landscape for business.To align with the CBDT notification issued earlier, the provisions relating to tax collection at source concerning remittances under the Liberalized Remittance Scheme have now been formally incorporated in the Finance Bill, 2024, setting the rate at 20% for amounts exceeding Rs. 7 lakhs in a financial year.The Finance Bill, 2024 proposes an extension of the time limit for introducing the faceless scheme by the Central Government for transfer pricing proceedings, DRP Proceedings, and ITAT Proceedings, up to March 31, 2025.The interim Budget 2024 may not have proposed significant tax announcements, but it very well positioned the prelude to the full budget post the upcoming elections. Considering the potential impact on the population across the four pillars of GYAN, a sizable portion of India stands to be covered. The interim Budget’s focus on the tax front resembles a report card, highlighting the maturity achieved by our tax system. The enhancement of taxpayer services was emphasized as a key priority.","This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data and N for Nari utthan.

Interim Budget for a Viksit Bharat: It’s for everyone and all,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/interim-budget-for-a-viksit-bharat-its-for-everyone-and-all/articleshow/107497439.cms,"By Akhilesh Tuteja

The Finance Minister on February 01, 2024, delivered a truly innovative interim budget. At first glance, it did not seem like an interim budget but looked more like the budget to drive further growth and a continuum of inclusive growth-oriented investments.At the outset, this budget brings a wonderful balance between fiscal prudence and continued investment for growth.It's not easy to continue the glide path of reducing the fiscal deficit and continuing to make significant investments in all areas including infrastructure, R&D, energy transition, technology, skilling, and social welfare. The surprising reduction in fiscal deficit of 5.8% as against the budgeted 5.9% for FY24 and the projection of 5.1% in FY25 with a clear focus on increasing investments was a huge positive.This was a budget for everyone and all because it caters to every part of the Indian economy and society. The FM has carefully catered to the investment needs of various sectors. The continued focus on youth, impoverished, women and farmers to increase their involvement and contribution to economic growth is evident. By committing an 11.1% increase in capital expenditure to 11,11,111 lakh crore, the FM has clearly brought every single 1 in this growth journey.What was very impressive was the inclusion strategy of the government. The focus on women's empowerment for the past few years is unprecedented, which is reflected in the inclusion of women in the workforce moving from 23.3% to 37% in the last five years. The thirty crore Mudra Yojna loans to women entrepreneurs were a great boost to the Nari Shakti initiative. We already have over 10 million Lakhpati Didis and what is truly evident is like a corporate CFO, the FM has revised the earlier target of 20 million Lakhpati Didis to 30 million. The government also plans to invest in initiatives to encourage young girls between the ages of 9 and 14 to undertake the vaccination for cervical cancer which is again a great boost to Nari Shakti.A lot needs to be done to bring more women into all parts of economic growth but the journey so far and the vision of the future is truly inspiring.While India continues on its technological prowess and makes its mark in new technologies like Artificial Intelligence, we need a multi-pronged strategy to harness the power of AI. We need a clear focus on building AI systems in India so that we not only emerge as a global leader in this new era but can build models, which are specific to India that will benefit Indians. At the same time, we need a very wide coverage program to build skills to leverage AI to its fullest potential. The biggest contribution we can make to the inclusion of youth in the economic development of the country is by skilling them in new skill areas. In the last few years, the Skill India Mission has trained 14 million youth, reskilled over 5 million youth and established a staggering 3,000 new ITIs. The future of any country will depend as much on capital investments as on skill investments.The focus on agricultural development and support to the farmer continues through direct financial assistance to farmers. The farmers have benefited by getting crop insurance through PM Fasal Bima Yojana. It's not just the farmers, the PM-SVANidhi provides credit assistance to a large number of street vendors.The last few years have seen the journey of affordable housing through Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY). There is a slight increase in allocation to launch a scheme for encouraging the middle class to build or buy new homes. This investment will likely propel a wider economic development and increase employment.India has seen a tremendous rise in entrepreneurship in the last few years. In order to continue the journey and promote new startups, the government proposes to extend certain tax benefits, which are expiring from March 2024 to March 2025. The MSMEs have not been left behind. With a proposal to provide timely finances to such enterprises, the government has paved the way for their growth, so they can look to compete globally.All in all, it’s a truly inclusive budget with a clear focus on development not just by giving away freebies but enabling the people to participate in the economic development activity. While the FM calls the comprehensive GDP - Governance, Development & Performance – to me, this budget is inclusive of another GDP – gender, demography, and professions.","Akhilesh Tuteja is Partner and Head, Clients and Markets, KPMG in India.

‘Enough domestic sources of demand to counter drag from external sector’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/enough-domestic-sources-of-demand-to-counter-drag-from-external-sector/articleshow/107372012.cms,"Do you think the

creates room for lower interest rates?

One of the issues that the Budget has flagged is the demographic challenge and opportunity and the societal change that is taking place. How do you view this?

Niti Aayog is working on the Viksit Bharat roadmap. What will be the focus areas?

You are as much a representative of the Centre as well as the states. Is it time to revisit the entire formula for transfers to states particularly on the issue of cesses and surcharges?

Suman Bery , who heads Niti Aayog , the govt think tank, is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China, which he says is also an opportunity for India. The economist is confident that Indian states remain resilient. Excerpts of the interview with TOI.The finance ministry expects the economy to grow 7% next year.Given the global situation, how do you see the prospects?The belief in the finance ministry is that we have a possible drag coming from the external sector but that we have other sources. We have enough domestic sources of demand. One has to applaud the political and economic judgment of FM in deciding that it was appropriate to pursue the path of fiscal consolidation. There is transparency. What this actually reflects is responsible economic management, which is one reason we are where we are. Second, it also creates a buffer so that there is policy space if we do encounter headwinds.That’s the hope and expectation. We have an independent central bank and an inflation targeting central bank, so it is up to the monetary policy committee to take a call through the monetary policy committee on the repo rate .The PM has said that when India grows its states grow. India is a composite of 37 states and UTs. They are each at very different points in their demographic transition. There are some states where the net replacement rate is down to 1%, like Kerala . There are others, particularly UP and Bihar, which are in their earliest stage of demographic transition and each one of these states is the size of a large European country. There are two implications of that — one is internal labour mobility and it will become an even larger part of our growth model. The govt has taken several steps to create a unified market. Our main endowment is our human capital and that has to be equipped to participate in global exchange in many ways. We know from China, Japan that the demographic dividend partly depends on markets and on human capital. But the golden period is fairly short lived, about 15 years, when the so called dependency ratio declines. The other big opportunity the PM has been highlighting is bringing women much more into the active labour force.When Niti was set up there was the idea of a three-year vision and a seven-year strategy paper. The reality is that schemes of govt tend to be aligned with the award of the Finance Commission . There are various established building blocks or hand holds which are already a matter of govt policy. The PM is much more interested in a national debate on what it means to be a Viksit Bharat or modern society. We have a collective goal and it is for the democratic polity to define what that goal should be. Its emphatically not for a super mandarin bureaucracy. It is not going to be Lee Kwan Yew’s Singapore led from the top.It’s entirely a finance ministry matter but I would be lying if I didn’t say when I visit certain states there is this complaint. A big frontier would be resource mobilisation at the state level. Second is going to be rationalisation of subsidies not only at the Union level, but also at the state level. All chief ministers sit on my governing council. When they convene as the governing council, I see them in their role as development practitioners. The world is beginning to appreciate quite how much institutional and political maturity India attained in our 75 years and the most fundamental dimension of a democracy, we have orderly transfers of power. There are enough buffers to ensure that what happens in state finances is unlikely to create macro instability. Those risks are well contained by our Constitution. The chief ministers know that they are going to be judged by development outcomes and so you can have the sugar rush of changing of pension plans or various handouts but if the cupboard is bare you are not going to be able to deliver.","Suman Bery is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China.

Government's Marathon to 2047: Emphasis on Fiscal Prudence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/governments-marathon-to-2047-emphasis-on-fiscal-prudence/articleshow/107371788.cms,"What was the thinking behind keeping the vote on account absolutely straight?

So is it the idea to keep the Budget completely transparent?

The capex has risen 11.1% and there is an emphasis on infrastructure spending. But there is also the hope that the private sector will now take over and start capital spending. Given the geopolitical situation, how confident is the govt that it will pan out as planned?

Finance secretary T V Somanathan, in an interview with TOI, says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047 . Excerpts:If you see the Budget speech you will see the emphasis on 2047. The govt has set its sight on running that marathon.Running to 2047 is a marathon , it’s not a sprint. If you are going to run a marathon, you need to be in good shape and you can’t have short-term stimulants or something that will get you some yards and then it’s done.The whole focus is on making India a developed country by 2047, for which a healthy present and a strong fiscal position is an important concomitant. Some purely short term measures don’t really fit into that picture. It’s a consistent picture: focus on the long term for which you need to build strength in the short term and that needs to be done by prudence in fiscal policy and by not doing things which can detract you from that path. Not doing the wrong thing is more important than appearing to do things.The idea is that govt finances may be good, bad or indifferent depending on the times, depending on the circumstances, depending on the policies. But what is the position should be reflected as reasonably and accurately as possible. That is an emphasis. As regards the Finance Commission, again the terms of reference that have been given to them are the terms in the Constitution.What is the means by which the devolution should be done is a matter they have full discretion. They can actually take all kinds of factors into account and in a sense we felt this time based on my review of the previous commissions that the right expression would be less is more. The shorter, less prescriptive terms of reference gives full scope for all stakeholders including state govts to express their viewpoints and for the commission to take a balanced view of the different perspectives and then come to its award. Ultimately the award of the Finance Commission is about devolution and grant for which full scope has now been given to them.n There are incipient signs of private capital expenditure accelerating. There are some surveys I have seen done by some of the chambers industry, which show high levels of investment. The PMI, which is a sort of leading indicator, is also looking pretty healthy. Capacity utilisation is one reason that private sector capital expenditure doesn’t immediately pick up when the economy starts accelerating because there is surplus capacity.But increasingly I get the sense that many industries are beginning to reach levels where they have to add capacity. When that happens capital investment will happen. Another pointer also mentioned in the Budget speech you may notice that our airlines have placed large orders for planes — that is capital expenditure.When you import 1,000 aircraft, it’s just not 1,000 aircraft, there are concomitant additions to ground handling facilities, you need airports to expand, you need to employ people to do that. That means a lot of jobs. The aircraft is capital but then look at the effect it is going to have on skilled jobs. So capital expenditure is happening. I am fairly confident that we will have decent capital expenditure in the year to come and that will become a new source of acceleration.",Finance secretary T V Somanathan says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047.

Income Tax Changes Budget 2024 : In the recent Budget 2024 speech, the Finance Minister kept the Section 80C tax deduction limit unchanged. The maximum limit for claiming tax benefits under Section 80C remains at Rs 1.5 lakh for the current fiscal year 2023-24 and will stay the same for individuals looking to save on taxes through Section 80C investments in the upcoming fiscal year 2024-25.Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions. Individuals can reduce their gross taxable income by up to Rs 1.5 lakh per financial year by engaging in these specific investments or expenditures.You can save on taxes through Section 80C by investing in things like Employees' Provident Fund (EPF), Public Provident Fund (PPF), Equity Linked Saving Scheme (ELSS) mutual funds, National Savings Certificate (NSC), and 5-year tax-saving fixed deposits with banks or post offices. Additionally, paying life insurance policy premiums also qualifies for tax benefits under Section 80C.It is important to note that each eligible investment comes with its specific maximum limit, rate of return, liquidity, and taxation rules for the earned returns, states ET in a report. For instance, the most you can invest in PPF in a financial year is Rs 1.5 lakh. Meanwhile, there's no limit on the amount you can invest in ELSS mutual funds, but the Section 80C deduction is capped at Rs 1.5 lakh.If individuals can't make specific investments, they can still get deductions under Section 80C from their gross taxable income through certain expenses. These expenses include repaying the principal amount of a home loan, tuition fees for children, payment of stamp duty, registration fees, and other costs related to buying a house.Since the financial year 2020-21, individuals without any business income must annually choose between the old and new tax regimes. As of the fiscal year 2023-24, the new tax regime is the default option. Consequently, individuals seeking tax deductions under Section 80C must opt for the old tax regime since this deduction isn't available in the new tax regime. It's crucial for taxpayers to be aware of these rules to make informed decisions about their tax planning and investment strategies.","Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget which is an interim budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year. The budget talks about inclusive development both, social and geographical, especially for youth, women, farmers, and the poor. Continued focus on improving logistics through infrastructure spend on roads, rail, airports, ports increases productivity for companies and citizens alike.To make ‘Viksit Bharat’ by 2047, the government’s focus is on improving and empowering people’s capabilities through various skilling initiatives. It is encouraging to see that Skill India Mission has succeeded in training more than 1.4 crore youth and upskilling and reskilling 54 lakh youth. I am particularly happy to see the continued focus on youth and women entrepreneurship and the announcement of a new fund which will give interest free 50 year loans for startups will provide a domestic fillip to startups supplementing venture capital we have traditionally relied on from abroad.PM Mudra Yojana has sanctioned 43 crore loans aggregating to 22.5 lakh crore to youth entrepreneurs and thirty crore Mudra Yojana loans to women entrepreneurs. There are several other schemes like Fund of Funds, Start-Up India, and Start-Up Credit Guarantee schemes that are assisting our youth. Further, the extension of tax benefits to Start-ups and investments made by sovereign wealth funds/pension funds, till 31st March 2025 depicts the government’s effort to support the startup eco- system.This aligns quite well with India Sanitation Coalition’s efforts to give impetus to the start-up world. Over the past 7 editions of our ISC-FICCI Sanitation Awards, we have recognized and promoted several start-ups in the sanitation space, many of whom are successful businesses now!While the finance minister did not provide detailed information on Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH), the budget allocation sees a slight increase in spend demonstrating continued focus on this highly successful program. The acknowledgement that the private sector has increasingly played a substantial role in addressing WASH issues in both urban and rural areas, with numerous projects underway through Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs), highlights the government's commitment to addressing challenges in this sector.A perfect example is the LightHouse Initiative initiated by the Department of Drinking Water along with the India Sanitation Coalition (ISC) by partnering with major corporates across India to develop model villages in Solid and Liquid Waste Management (SLWM) under SBM-Grameen. From this budget, there is an expectation that the government will persist in prioritizing Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) as the path toward achieving the country's Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6). Additionally, it is hoped that the government will uphold its commitment to making necessary infrastructural investments for SLWM.The budget speech rightly celebrates the fact that we have 83 lakh SHGs and 9 crore women beneficiaries. The microfinance movement in the country and the possibility of empowering women members of SHGs through livelihood skilling is a key to bringing women into mainstream economic advancement.The focus on green growth, rooftop solar, wind, biomass, e-vehicles all help with our green energy thrust. The tourism sector was mentioned and could be a huge job provider for youth and women.Guided by the principle ‘Reform, Perform, and Transform’, the budget emphasizes efficient implementation of various policies by improving coordination with states and relevant stakeholders. This is critical both for infra spend and social programsIt is noteworthy that ISC’s Climate Resilient Coastal Cities project which is being implemented in PPP (Public-Private Partnership) mode in four coastal states of Karnataka, Gujarat, Goa and Maharashtra is congruent with the government’s priority of promoting climate-resilient activities for the blue economy 2.0, a scheme for restoration and adaptation measures, and coastal aquaculture.The budget also focuses on the Aspirational districts program where assistance will be given to the states for faster development of aspirational districts and blocks, including the generation of ample economic opportunities. This is again very crucial as it has a huge potential to transform the landscape of our country while making sure no -one is left behind.Overall, this budget has embraced economic strategies and develops the building blocks that nurture and uphold growth, promote inclusive and sustainable development, and enhance productivity.","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year.

She filed a case of dowry harassment against her husband and in-laws, which is pending in court. In July 2022, the wife lodged another FIR accusing him of unnatural sex.“The only question for consideration is whether a husband during the subsistence of marriage while residing together can be said to be guilty of marital rape… Section 375 exception 2 of IPC provides that sexual intercourse or sexual acts by a man with his own wife, the wife not being under 15 years of age, is not rape,” Justice Ahluwalia said.The only exception to this provision is IPC section 376(B), where the sexual act with the wife occurs when they are living separately on account of judicial separation, the court said.“When rape includes insertion of penis in the mouth, urethra or anus of a woman and if that act is committed with his wife, not below the age of 15 years, then consent of the wife becomes immaterial,” the order says.Referring to the amended definition of ‘rape’ under IPC section 375, the HC order said under the circumstances, absence of consent of wife for unnatural act loses its importance. “Marital rape has not been recognised so far,” Justice Ahluwalia said, quashing the FIR and subsequent proceedings against the petitioner.","Madhya Pradesh HC has ruled that unnatural sex with wife is not rape, and her consent is immaterial in such cases.

Cutting close to deadline

NEW DELHI: After weeks of suspense, the Congress on Friday finally declared its candidates for the Amethi and Rae Bareli Lok Sabha constituencies of Uttar Pradesh.Rahul Gandhi has been fielded from Rae Bareli while Kishori Lal Sharma will be contesting from Amethi.The Congress, which is contesting 17 Lok Sabha seats in Uttar Pradesh as part of the seat-sharing deal with the Samajwadi Party (SP), had announced candidates for all the seats barring Amethi and Rae Bareli.Rae Bareli is also a bastion of the Congress. From 1967 to 1977, the seat was held by former prime minister Indira Gandhi, and from 2004 until her appointment to the Rajya Sabha in 2024, by Sonia Gandhi .Rahul will file his nomination from the constituency on Friday. He will be pitted against BJP's Dinesh Pratap Singh. He had been fielded by the party from the seat in 2019 too.Singh had lost to Sonia by a margin of 1.67 lakh votes.On being selected again to fight from Rae Bareli, Singh said: ""I assure the country that farewell of 'nakli' Gandhis from Rae Bareli is certain. It is certain that BJP's 'lotus' will bloom, and Congress will lose. I have even fought against 4-time MP Sonia Gandhi, so Priyanka Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi are not important to me. Whichever Gandhi comes to Rae Bareli, they will lose.""The announcement comes on the last day for filing of nominations for Phase 5 of the Lok Sabha elections. Both the constituencies are going to the polls on May 20.Rahul's defeat in Amethi, once considered a Congress 'pocket borough', at the hands of Irani in the 2019 polls was seen as a significant blow to the party's national prestige. Irani won the seat by a margin of around 55,000 votes.Rahul represented Amethi in the Lok Sabha from 2004 to 2019. His father and former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi, too, was an elected member of Amethi in the Lower House from 1981 till his death in 1991. Sonia Gandhi contested elections from here in 1999 before passing the baton on to Rahul in 2004.Rahul currently represents Wayanad in the Lok Sabha while Irani is bidding for a fresh term from Amethi.(With inputs from agencies)",Rahul Gandhi has been fielded from Rae Bareli while Kishori Lal Sharma will be contesting from Amethi.

Bose asked her on April 19 to meet him with her CV; she went to meet him on April 24 at 12.45 pm, when he ""touched her inappropriately and made untoward advances"", the complaint says. Bose again called her to his office on Thursday but the woman, instead of going alone, asked her supervisor to accompany her. The woman told cops that Bose asked the supervisor to leave after some time, following which he assured her of a promotion and then ""touched her cheek"", prompting her to protest.A video circulating since the evening shows the woman complaining to a senior cop that she had been molested. ""This is not the first time this has happened to me,"" she is heard saying on phone before explaining why she had not complained earlier: ""I had kept quiet as I was scared of losing my (contractual) job."" She felt impelled to complain on Thursday, after the latest incident , to protect others from facing the ordeal she had faced. She is also seen referring to another woman who made similar complaints in the past.""We are duty-bound to register a case and begin a probe since a woman has lodged this complaint,"" a senior police officer said. Other seniors told TOI they had recorded the woman's statement but did not register any FIR. ""Article 361 of the Indian Constitution insulates the governor from any criminal proceeding while in office,"" another senior official said, adding that legal experts would be consulted.Raj Bhavan issued a statement a couple of hours later.

Another statement thanked Raj Bhavan staff ""who expressed solidarity against derogatory narratives circulated by two disgruntled employees as political parties' agents"".Yet another release issued after 10pm banned the entry of cops and state finance minister Chandrima Bhattacharya in Raj Bhavan premises. The cop ban was to prevent their entry ""in the guise of conducting unauthorised, illegitimate, sham and motivated investigations to placate political bosses during election"", the statement said, banning minister Bhattacharya's entry in Raj Bhavan premises in Kolkata, Darjeeling and Barrackpore. Governor C V Ananda Bose would not attend any finance department event, the statement said, adding that the attorney-general would be consulted for legal steps against Bhattacharya. PM Narendra Modi reached Raj Bhavan at 10pm, where he stayed the night. He is slated to leave Raj Bhavan on Friday morning for campaigning in East Burdwan, Nadia and Birbhum.The TMC posted on X: ""Appalling and unthinkable!

KL Sharma , a trusted aide of Sonia Gandhi, the former Congress president, served as her representative during her tenure as the member of Parliament from Rae Bareli.

Kishori Lal, a dedicated member of the Congress party, has been diligently overseeing the party's activities and operations in Amethi and Rae Bareli for a long time period. Kishori Lal has played a crucial role in maintaining the party's presence and influence in both the constituencies.

Kishori Lal Sharma, a native of Ludhiana, Punjab, was first introduced to Amethi by Rajiv Gandhi in approximately 1983.

Following Rajiv Gandhi's tragic demise in 1991, the Gandhi family stopped participating in elections from this constituency. However, Sharma remained steadfast in his support and continued to actively campaign for Congress party candidates in the area.

Kishori Lal Sharma was instrumental in Sonia Gandhi's maiden electoral triumph in Amethi in 1999. It was through this victory that Sonia secured her entry into the Parliament for the first time.

KL Sharma has also worked for the Congress party in Bihar and Punjab.

NEW DELHI: The Congress party has chosen Kishori Lal Sharma as their candidate for the Amethi Lok Sabha constituency in Uttar Pradesh, putting an end to the speculation that had been circulating for weeks regarding their candidates for both Amethi and Rae Bareli seats.Sharma will face off against BJP's Smriti Irani , who emerged victorious against Rahul Gandhi in the 2019 general elections.Meanwhile, the Congress party has decided to field Rahul Gandhi from the Rae Bareli constituency.The two seats will go to polls on May 20 in the fifth of the seven-phase general election.","Kishori Lal Sharma is a trusted aide of Sonia Gandhi, the former Congress president.

That's why Buffett encourages investors to pay more attention to the conglomerate's operating earnings that exclude the investment figures. By that measure, Berkshire's operating earnings jumped 39% to $11.222 billion from last year's $8.065 billion as its insurance companies led a strong performance.The three analysts surveyed by FactSet Research had predicted operating earnings of $6,701.87 per Class A share.Buffett did sell off nearly $6 billion in stocks during the quarter, including trimming about 13% of Berkshire's massive Apple stake. The investment in the iPhone maker is still the biggest one in the $364 billion portfolio at $135.4 billion.But the estimated value of Berkshire's Apple stake suggests that Buffett sold off more than 100 million shares. Buffett has said he invested in Apple's stock because of how devoted consumers are to the iPhone and other Apple products.Apple CEO Tim Cook, who is at the Berkshire meeting, told CNBC that he still considers it a privilege to have Berkshire as a major shareholder.Berkshire reported a $2.6 billion underwriting profit at its insurers, up from $911 million a year ago.BNSF railroad's profits did disappoint and drop 8% to $1.143 billion, but most of its many other companies delivered solid results, including a 72% jump in operating profits at the utility unit that added $717 million to Berkshire's total.Berkshire's revenue grew 5% to $89.87 billion in the quarter. The two analysts who reported estimates to FactSet predicted $87.044 billion revenue.With no major acquisitions in sight, Berkshire's massive cash pile continued to grow to a record $188.993 billion in the quarter. Berkshire even spent $2.6 billion repurchasing shares during the first three months of the year, but its companies that include Geico insurance, BNSF railroad, several major utilities and an assortment of dozens of others keep generating mountains of cash.THOUSANDS ATTEND WARREN BUFFETT'S 'WOODSTOCK FOR CAPITALISTS'The main arena was already three-quarters full within half an hour of the doors opening Saturday because people are always eager to vacuum up tidbits of wisdom from billionaire Warren Buffett, who famously dubbed the meeting 'Woodstock for Capitalists.'But a key ingredient is missing this year: It's the first meeting since Vice Chairman Charlie Munger died.The meeting opened with a video tribute to Munger recounting his life and highlighting some of his best known quotes from the meetings over the years, including classic lines like ""If people weren't so often wrong, we wouldn't be so rich."" The video also featured old interviews with Buffett and Munger talking about their epic friendship.For decades, Munger shared the stage with Buffett every year for the marathon question and answer session that is the event's centerpiece. Munger routinely let Buffett take the lead with expansive responses that went on for several minutes. Then Munger himself would cut directly to the point. He is remembered for calling cryptocurrencies stupid, telling people to ""marry the best person that will have you"" and comparing many unproven internet businesses in 2000 to ""turds.""He and Buffett functioned as a classic comedy duo, with Buffett offering lengthy setups to Munger's witty one-liners. Together, they transformed Berkshire from a floundering textile mill into a massive conglomerate made up of a variety of interests, from insurance companies such as Geico to BNSF railroad to several major utilities and an assortment of other companies.Munger often summed up the key Berkshire's success as ""trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very intelligent."" He and Buffett also were known for sticking to businesses they understood well.""Warren always did at least 80% of the talking. But Charlie was a great foil,"" said Stansberry Research analyst Whitney Tilson, who was looking forward to his 27th consecutive meeting with a bit of a heavy heart because of Munger's absence.That absence, however, may well create space for shareholders to get to know better the two executives who directly oversee Berkshire's companies: Ajit Jain , who manages the insurance units, and Greg Abel , who handles everything else. Abel will one day replace the 93-year-old Buffett as CEO.Morningstar analyst Greggory Warren said he hopes Abel will speak up more this year and let shareholders see some of the brilliance Berkshire executives talk about. Ever since Munger let it slip at the annual meeting three years ago that Abel would be the successor, Buffett has repeatedly reassured investors that he's confident in the pick.Experts say the company has a solid culture built on integrity, trust, independence and an impressive management roster ready to take over.""Greg's a rock star,"" said Chris Bloomstran, president of Semper Augustus Investments Group. ""The bench is deep. He won't have the same humor at the meeting. But I think we all come here to get a reminder every year to be rational.""","Berkshire Hathaway reported a $12.7 billion profit, or $8.825 per Class A share, in the quarter. That's roughly one-third of the $35.5 billion profit that Berkshire reported a year ago. Buffett did sell off nearly $6 billion in stocks during the quarter, including trimming about 13% of Berkshire's massive Apple stake.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109843454,imgsize-83540,width-400,resizemode-4/109843454.jpg"

Fed's John Williams says 2% inflation target 'critical',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/feds-john-williams-says-2-inflation-target-critical/articleshow/109832664.cms,"PALO ALTO: The US central bank's 2% target for inflation is key to achieving price stability and essential for ensuring economic prosperity , New York Federal Reserve Bank President John Williams said on Friday.His defense of the inflation target comes amid persistent calls from some corners for the Fed to overhaul the way it guides, sets and communicates policy.""Theory and experience have also shown the importance of transparency and clear communication, including setting an explicit, numerical longer-run inflation target, and of taking appropriate actions to support the achievement of that goal,"" Williams told a monetary policy conference at Stanford University's Hoover Institution. ""These are critical in anchoring inflation expectations, which, in turn, help keep inflation at the target.""The Fed has been battling too-high inflation for more than two years, raising interest rates from near zero in March 2022 by more than five full percentage points, an aggressive pace not seen in 40 years.While price pressures have eased since their peak in mid-2022, inflation is still running above the Fed's 2% goal, a centerpiece of the Fed's approach to policy since 2012.Later this year Fed policymakers plan a broad review of the central bank's policy framework, and a number of critics are urging big changes.Indeed, former US Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers at the same conference said the Fed should drop its2% inflation goal.Keeping it, he predicted, would force the US economy into a ""fairly serious recession"" in coming years.Summers also took aim other mainstays of Fed communication, including what he called a regular ""cacophony"" of policy views as central bankers lay out their thinking in speeches and at public events.Speaking on the same panel as Williams, Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee defended the diverse range of views and said that communication is critical.The Fed should in fact beef up its quarterly ""dot plot"" of policymakers' interest-rate-path views by including the individual economic expectations that inform each one.Fed policymakers earlier this week agreed to leave short-term borrowing costs in the 5.25%-5.5% range where they have been since July 2023.Neither Goolsbee nor Williams offered any updated views on where inflation will go this year and whether or when the Fed should cut rates.","The Fed has been battling too-high inflation for more than two years.

‘Your fund is under attack’: BlackRock fights to repel Saba raid,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/your-fund-is-under-attack-blackrock-fights-to-repel-saba-raid/articleshow/109822357.cms,"A few days ago, BlackRock Inc. sent an unusual message to thousands of clients. It contained none of the formulaic language or inscrutable fine print typically packed into these sorts of statements. No, this was a call to arms.“Your fund is under attack,” the headline screamed in bold print.The attacker: Boaz Weinstein , the sharp-elbowed Wall Street money manager who says price distortions in funds run by BlackRock and others are cheating investors out of billions of dollars, and they need to be eliminated.This has turned into something of a crusade for Weinstein. Last month, his hedge fund , Saba Capital Management, launched a frenetic bid to have investors remove BlackRock as manager of six funds overseeing about $10 billion in assets.Which is what triggered the note BlackRock sent to clients. “If Saba were to succeed, it may seek to appoint itself as investment advisor” and fundamentally disrupt the funds’ objectives and strategies, “all to enrich itself.”The ongoing feud has turned the $250 billion closed-end fund industry, a normally sleepy Wall Street backwater, into the scene of one of the most dramatic power struggles in finance — one that’s coming to a head at shareholder meetings next month.Weinstein says BlackRock is not only trapping shareholders in underperforming products, but also failing to meet basic governance standards by stymieing his efforts to elect new directors. BlackRock points to Weinstein’s own track record, where he took over a closed-end fund meant to invest in floating-rate loans and put some of its money into crypto exposure and SPACs.Both sides vow they have the moral high ground.“We need to show there’s a cost to illegally entrenching themselves to protect their management fees while doing terrible things to shareholders,” Weinstein said in an interview, adding that many of BlackRock’s closed-end funds have track record of “horrible performance.”Weinstein’s move — echoing some of the most audacious corporate raids of the 1980s — is the latest escalation in a multiyear campaign targeting closed-end funds trading well below the value of their underlying assets.The 50-year-old hedge fund boss currently has about $6 billion invested in the products, using his stakes in dozens of funds to press money managers to buy back shares near their full market value (known as a tender) or turn their funds into open-ended vehicles, which would produce a similar result.In recent years he’s taken on the likes of Eaton Vance, Franklin Templeton and Voya Financial, convincing managers to tender, winning board seats and even prompting them to resign from their role as fund adviser.Weinstein notes that if Saba were to win the proxy battles , it wouldn’t necessarily mean the hedge fund would assume management of the funds. That would be up to the boards, but Saba has said it would “stand ready” to assist and may offer to do the job.In mid-2021, Saba took over the $600 million Voya Prime Rate Trust, now known as the Saba Capital Income & Opportunities Fund (ticker BRW). After a pair of tender offers, the fund has returned an annualized 4.1%, more than triple its high-yield bond benchmark, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It ranked third of 22 peer funds in 2022, 14th in 2023 and second to last this year through April, according to Morningstar Inc. data, which compares the product to US bank loan closed-end funds.By comparison, the $1.6 billion BlackRock Innovation & Growth Term Trust (ticker BIGZ) has lost an annualized 23% over the same period, while the $1.7 billion BlackRock ESG Capital Allocation Term Trust (ticker ECAT) has gained an annualized 0.8% since its September 2021 inception. BIGZ ranked either first or second in its Morningstar category of only two funds over the period; ECAT ranked sixth in 2022, second in 2023 and eighth this year through April in its group of 11 funds.BlackRock is quick to point out that BIGZ and ECAT returned 19% and 32%, respectively, last year as markets rebounded broadly.Still, the funds continue to trade significantly below their so-called net asset value, or NAV. BIGZ currently trades at a 17% discount, while ECAT trades at a 10% discount, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That compares to an 8.3% discount for Saba’s BRW.BlackRock is warning investors that Saba could radically alter the composition of the funds should it win control, exposing shareholders to greater risk. After Saba took over BRW, it began adding everything from crypto exposure to SPACs to other closed-end funds Weinstein is campaigning against. BlackRock says Saba’s tactics have nothing to do with helping investors other than himself and his hedge fund clients.“Saba’s true goal is a quick payout and, more recently, revenue in the form of management fees,” a BlackRock spokesperson said via email.‘Hot Hand’Last year, Weinstein launched three proxy campaigns for board seats against the money-management giant, failing to win a single one.Instead of backing down, Weinstein is pushing even harder this year. In addition to efforts to terminate BlackRock’s fund management agreements, he’s also trying to shake up the boards of 10 BlackRock funds.Saba has nominated a slate of directors, including a former Deutsche Bank AG derivatives-trading executive and Alexander Vindman, a retired US Army lieutenant colonel who testified against former President Donald Trump during impeachment proceedings.“Saba has been growing assets and has the hot hand, successfully waging multitudes of successful activism campaigns in the closed-end fund space over the recent past,” said Erik Herzfeld, president at Thomas J. Herzfeld Advisors. Herzfeld manages investment products that buy closed-end funds. “BlackRock, given their depth and knowledge, has the ability to challenge Saba’s advancement.”For a Bloomberg dashboard on activist campaigns, click hereWeinstein says he’s redoubling his efforts in part because the asset-management giant, he alleges, has undermined the ability of shareholders to get a fair shake at annual meetings.Last year he won a lawsuit against BlackRock — and other fund managers — for adopting so-called control share provisions that can deter proxy attacks.BlackRock is appealing that ruling and now finds itself defending against another lawsuit from Saba. In March, Weinstein’s firm sued BlackRock in federal court in New York, arguing that an “entrenchment bylaw” in ECAT “strips away any realistic prospect” for a shareholder to elect trustees other than the incumbents. Lawyers for BlackRock said in court filings that “every share of ECAT has exactly the same right to vote.”“BlackRock has behaved leaps and bounds worse than all the other managers, and so a tender for shares is not enough,” Weinstein said. “They put themselves in a spot where they need a strong response — to remedy the performance but also as a signal to the industry, that shareholders are not going to stand for this anymore.”Stephen Minar, managing director focused on closed-end funds at BlackRock, said that “Saba uses the veil of governance to disrupt the investment objectives and strategies of closed-end funds by forcing changes that enrich itself at the expense of long-term shareholders.”BlackRock notes that in recent years, it has sought to increase shareholder profits and lower costs. It’s repurchased $1.3 billion of shares in its closed-end funds since 2016, including about $180 million of BIGZ shares, and it has started new funds without load fees that were typically charged in the past.Proxy BattleAs voting gets started ahead of June shareholder meetings, both BlackRock and Saba are actively seeking to corral investors to their cause.BlackRock is sending out white proxy cards to individuals and paying about $1.7 million to advisory firm Georgeson to help solicit votes for the six funds, according to regulatory filings. Saba is sending out gold proxy cards.The hedge fund has launched a website to keep shareholders updated on its campaigns. Splashed across the top is “Fink about it,” a reference to BlackRock Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink. Saba said it will be hosting a webinar on May 20 to discuss its plans “to hold BlackRock accountable.”“I’m not only fighting for these funds, I’m fighting so that the next 30 funds don’t emulate these shady tactics,” Weinstein said. “I don’t need Larry Fink to apologize to shareholders for what BlackRock did, though they should be embarrassed.”","Hedge fund boss Boaz Weinstein says BlackRock and others are cheating investors out of billions of dollars.

US West Texas Intermediate crude for June was up 26 cents, or 0.3%, to $79.21 per barrel.Both benchmarks are set for weekly losses as investors are concerned higher-for-longer interest rates will curb economic growth in the US, the world's leading oil consumer, as well as in other parts of the world.Brent was on course for a 6.2% weekly decline, and WTI for a loss of 5.6% on the week.""We view the commodities sell-off over the last two days as collateral damage from the Fed repricing and non-fundamental in nature,"" JP Morgan analysts wrote in a note.For further guidance, the market awaits US economic data and indicators of future crude supply from the world's top producer.The US Federal Reserve held interest rates steady this week, and flagged high inflation readings that could delay rate cuts.Later on Friday, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics will release its monthly nonfarm payroll report, a measure of the strength of the country's job market the Fed takes into consideration when setting interest rates.Higher rates typically weigh on the economy and can reduce oil demand.Also on Friday, energy services firm Baker Hughes is due to release its weekly count of oil and gas rigs, an indicator of future crude output. [RIG/U]Geopolitical risk premiums due to the Israel-Hamas war, which has the potential to lead to oil supply disruption, have also faded as Israel and Hamas consider a temporary ceasefire and hold talks with international mediators.Further ahead, the next meeting of OPEC+ oil producers - members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies including Russia - is set for June 1.Three sources from the OPEC+ group said it could extend its voluntary oil output cuts of 2.2 million barrels per day beyond June if oil demand does not increase.JP Morgan, which expects OPEC+ to extend cuts beyond June, said that a counter-seasonal rise in oil inventories last month would be a concern for the producer group.""The stock builds in April will turn into draws in May through August and can push prices into the $90s in September,"" the bank said.","Brent crude futures for July rose 31 cents to $83.98 a barrel by 0755 GMT.
