Beat this! NPS funds are delivering higher returns than mutual fund schemes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/beat-this-nps-funds-are-delivering-higher-returns-than-mutual-fund-schemes-check-returns-over-years/articleshow/109683359.cms,"Low Cost, High Returns in NPS Funds

The National Pension System (NPS) funds have quietly outperformed mutual fund schemes in terms of returns, even as investors are bombarded by the extensive promotion of mutual funds through the 'mutual funds sahi hai' campaign. Over the past decade, NPS equity funds have consistently surpassed the largecap mutual fund category, with the flexi-cap category only slightly ahead.NPS debt funds have also demonstrated superior performance compared to mutual fund debt schemes. In the previous year, the NPS Tier II Gilt and Corporate Bond funds have generated higher returns than the average long-duration debt fund and corporate bond fund. This outperformance can be attributed to the significantly lower fund management charges of NPS compared to mutual funds, resulting in higher returns for investors, states an ET report by Babar Zaidi.""The NPS is the cheapest product available in the Indian market,"" said Rahul Bhagat, CEO of DSP Pension Fund. Investors pay a mere 0.03-0.09% (or Rs 30-90 per lakh) annually, which is comparable to the charges of ETFs offered by mutual funds but significantly lower than the 1.5-2.5% charged by actively managed equity funds.Although the fund management charges of debt funds are lower at 0.5-1.25%, they still cannot compete with the ultra-low costs of NPS funds .While a 2% annual fund management charge may seem low, it accumulates to a substantial amount over the long term due to compounding. For example, if an investor contributes Rs 5,000 per month through an SIP in a mutual fund with a 2% annual charge, they will pay approximately Rs 19 lakh in fund management fees over 25 years. In contrast, the same investment in the NPS, assuming the maximum 0.09% fund management charge, will cost only Rs 1 lakh over the same period, assuming a compounded annual return of 9%.Investors who do not wish to lock their money in the NPS until retirement can opt for the NPS Tier II option, which offers no tax benefits on contributions but also no withdrawal restrictions. Investments can be made today and withdrawn the next day without any exit charge. However, investing in Tier II is only possible if the investor has a regular Tier I account.While investing in Tier II is advantageous for gilt and corporate bond funds, it may not be as beneficial for equity funds due to ambiguous tax rules. Some tax experts highlight that capital gains from investments in NPS Tier II funds may not be eligible for the favorable tax treatment enjoyed by investments in stocks and equity-oriented mutual funds.Long-term capital gains of up to Rs 1 lakh from equity mutual funds are tax-free in a financial year, with gains beyond ₹1 lakh taxed at 10%. Short-term capital gains are taxed at 15%.However, since no securities transaction tax is paid on NPS transactions, the investment may not qualify for these benefits. The capital gains will be added to the individual's income and taxed at their marginal rate. ""This will not suit taxpayers in the 20% tax bracket and above,"" said Chartered Accountant Nishant Khemani. ""The higher tax on capital gains from equity investments will take away any advantage accruing from the lower costs,"" he added.","The National Pension System (NPS) funds have quietly outperformed mutual fund schemes in terms of returns.

Beyond Rs 76k-crore: Government to scale up semiconductor package,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/beyond-rs-76k-crore-government-to-scale-up-semiconductor-package/articleshow/109673841.cms,"NEW DELHI: Government is looking at rolling out a fresh multi-billion-dollar incentive package for semiconductor companies after nearly exhausting the Rs 76,000-crore plan that was launched in Dec 2021 for supporting investing companies, top sources told TOI.Preliminary work on the new package, which is “in all likelihood be much bigger than the previous one”, has already begun, even though announcements in this regard will be made only once the new govt takes charge post the national elections, they said.“The new package would be one of the key agendas for the new govt and will be taken up on a priority basis,” one of the sources said, pointing out that new proposals that are coming in for semiconductors necessitate a fresh package.“The matter would be tabled before the new Cabinet as some of the proposals are at an advanced stage and would require immediate assurances from the state in terms of incentives,” the source said.Success of Dec 2021 package is prompting the govt to work out a new one, especially in view of the aggressive stance of countries such as the US and China, which have announced much bigger packages for companies that are investing in semiconductors.Under the current plan, govt extends fiscal support of up to 50% of a project’s cost to eligible display and semiconductor fabricators. This has been almost exhausted after the spate of investments that came in.India, which had previously failed to get any credible proposals for semiconductor manufacturing after trying for decades, finally managed to score big after American Micron emerged as the first major player to enter the space with a Rs 22,500-crore testing and packaging unit in Gujarat in June last year.This was followed up with approval to three proposals worth nearly Rs 1.3 lakh crore in Feb this year. These comprise: Rs 91,000-crore project of Tata Electronics to set up India’s first semiconductor fab unit with Taiwanese Powerchip Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp at Dholera in Gujarat; Rs 27,000-crore Semiconductor Assembly and Test (TSAT) unit by Tata in Morigaon, Assam; and Rs 7,600-crore project of CG Power with Japanese Renesas Electronics and Stars Microelectronics of Thailand.Govt has now received new proposals which are at a very advanced stage of discussions. These include a display fab unit proposal – the country’s first – by Japanese Sharp that can see investments of up to Rs 40,000 crore. There is also a Rs 90,000 crore plan of Israel’s chipmaker Tower Semiconductors for investments in India.“The proposals need urgent solutions, especially as the companies want clarity from govt on incentive support,” the source added.","Government is looking at rolling out a fresh multi-billion-dollar incentive package for semiconductor companies.

BSE’s stock crashes 13% after Sebi seeks fee difference of around 165 crore,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/bses-stock-crashes-13-after-sebi-seeks-fee-difference-of-around-165-crore/articleshow/109708246.cms,"MUMBAI: The stock price of BSE crashed 13.3% on Monday after it said that it would have to pay some additional amount to market regulator Sebi for wrongful benchmarking of the regulatory fee for options contracts traded on it since fiscal 2007. For a similar incident MCX has also been served a letter by Sebi and the stock lost 2.4%.Over these years, while the two bourses had paid regulatory fees based on ‘premium value’ of options contracts, Sebi has demanded fees based on ‘notional value’.NSE has always been paying this fee based on premium value.According to some estimates, BSE will have to pay regulatory fee worth about Rs 165 crore plus GST while for MCX the financial burden is limited to about Rs 1.8 crore plus GST.Sebi on Friday had sent letters to the bourses demanding higher regulatory fee for the past 16 years after it was detected that there was a wrongful benchmarking of the regulatory fee by both the bourses.The difference between premium value and notional value arise only in case of options contracts and not in case of cash and futures trading.For example, a sensex options contract of 75,000 strike price is traded at Rs 100. Here Rs 75,000 is the notional value while the premium value is Rs 100. Currently, Sebi charges Re 1 per Rs 10 lakh turnover on all purchase and sales transactions in the securities other than debt securities. For debt securities, the charge is Re 0.25 per Rs 10 lakh worth of turnover, a report by ICICI Securities said.On Monday, the BSE stock opened 15% down, slid further to an intra-day low at Rs 2,612 (down 18.6%) but recovered some ground to close at Rs 2,783, down 13.3%. MCX lost 6.5% in intra-day trade and closed 2.4% lower at Rs 4,066.BSE on Monday said that it was “evaluating the validity, or otherwise, of the claim as per Sebi communication.” It also said that its estimated additional fee outgo may vary as the turnover data of United Stock Exchange (that was merged with BSE in FY16) was being collated by the bourse.According to the I-Sec report, the rise in cost due to higher regulatory fee could shave off about 20% from BSE’s net profit for fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2026. This higher cost could be managed by hiking trading costs by about 30%. “However, this sensitivity is subjective to estimates and has many levers of options volume growth, options cost growth and also development in premium to notional turnover,” the report said.Higher regulatory fees could also increase BSE’s cost of operations by about Rs 260 crore for FY25 and by Rs 381 crore for FY26, analysts at I-Sec estimated.","BSE stock opened 15% down, slid further to an intra-day low at Rs 2,612 (down 18.6%) but recovered some ground to close at £2,783, down 13.3%.

No news of escalation of geopolitical tensions in West Asia, softening of govt bond yields in the US and some steady corporate performance in the domestic market over the weekend added to the positive sentiment on Dalal Street as markets opened for trading.After steady trades in the early hours, leading indices gained strength and rallied to close near the day’s highs.Sensex touched an intra-day high at 74,721 points and closed near that level, up 1.3% on the day. On the NSE, Nifty gained 223 points or 1% to close at 22,643 points. Some short covering also helped the gains during closing hours, market players said. The surge on Monday was the biggest since March 1 (1,245 points).According to Vinod Nair of Geojit Financial Services, Indian markets rebounded, aided by upbeat earnings by US tech sector leaders and a drop in US 10-year yields. Domestically, the Bank Nifty index outperformed, driven by strong performance of some of the banks during the fourth quarter that ended in March. “An ease in tensions (in West Asia), coupled with stable earnings, is expected to maintain positive market sentiment .”On Monday, the Bank Nifty scaled a new life-high at 49,474 points. The day’s session also saw India VIX — a gauge for volatility — jump by 12%, but that didn’t stop local investors from taking the indices higher, dealers said.Monday’s rally made investors richer by nearly Rs 3 lakh crore, with BSE’s market capitalisation now at Rs 413.2 lakh crore, official data showed. The day’s gains came mainly on the back of buying by speculators and non-institutional investors. According to BSE data, domestic institutions and foreign funds were net buyers at Rs 692 crore and Rs 169 crore respectively.Going forward, the decision late on Wednesday by the US Fed’s rate setting committee and the non-farm payroll data for the US could dictate markets’ trend, Nair said.","Sensex touched intra-day high at 74,721 points and closed near that level, up 1.3% on the day.

"IMF boosts Asia growth forecast this year on China, India",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/imf-boosts-asia-growth-forecast-this-year-on-china-india/articleshow/109709554.cms,"The International Monetary Fund boosted its growth forecast for Asia this year, reflecting a rosier outlook for the region’s two largest economies and flagging a possible upward revision in its outlook for China.Asia is set to expand 4.5% in 2024 from the prior year, 0.3 percentage points higher than the October regional outlook but a slowdown from last year’s 5% pace, according to the IMF report on Tuesday.The latest data has taken into account the higher forecast for India published earlier this month and China’s pace, on the back of expectations that government stimulus will boost growth. On China, the IMF said first-quarter growth came in stronger than expected on robust exports and manufacturing demand, which may prompt another upward revision.“Global disinflation and the prospect of lower central bank interest rates have made a soft landing more likely, hence risks to the near-term outlook are now broadly balanced,” Krishna Srinivasan , director of IMF’s Asia and Pacific department, wrote in a blog post.China’s central government has ramped up spending this year to support an economy still reeling from a weakened property sector and to propel growth to its target near 5% this year. In India, the government ramped up capital spending by a third for 2024, the third year in a row.China’s real gross domestic product is seen expanding 4.6% in 2024 from the prior year, and India to rise 6.8% this year, the IMF said. Officials left the 2025 regional outlook unchanged at a 4.3% advance.Several risks remain, the IMF said. Chief among them is a long-term property sector downturn in China, which would weaken demand and prolong deflation. Other challenges include growing fiscal deficits and risks to trade from US-China tensions.Officials also warned Asian nations of pinning too much on expectations for the Federal Reserve’s path when deciding their own monetary policy. Indonesia this month unexpectedly raised interest rates to address a currency walloped by a strengthening US dollar. Southeast Asia’s largest economy is among many countries in the region contending with currency depreciation as the prospects of early Fed rate cuts wane.While following the Fed “could limit exchange rate volatility” but “it risks that central banks would fall behind (or move ahead of) the curve and destabilize inflation expectations,” Srinivasan wrote.","Asia is set to expand 4.5% in 2024 from the prior year, 0.3 percentage points higher than the October regional outlook.

'Can’t levy interest on loan amounts not received': RBI to Banks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/cant-levy-interest-on-loan-amounts-not-received-rbi-to-banks/articleshow/109708357.cms,"RBI on Monday warned lenders to not levy interest from the date of loan sanction, instead of actual disbursement. In a home loan or other loans, there is often a lag between sanction and disbursement and charging it from the date of sanction imposes additional interest cost on the borrower.Charging interest from the date of loan sanction or loan agreement execution rather than from the date of actual disbursement is a violation of fair lending practices norms.Customers end up paying interest on money they haven’t received, which inflates the cost of borrowing. Second, in the case of loans disbursed by cheque, charging interest from the date of the cheque rather than when it's cashed or deposited can lead to customers being charged for funds they haven't accessed. These practices result in customers paying more than they should for borrowing money and eroding trust in the lending institution. Similarly, RBI said it had come across instances where banks or NBFCs were levying interest for the entire month even if the loan was disbursed or repaid within the month. Again, customers end up paying more interest than they should, as they are being charged for days when the loan has already been repaid.Besides, they were collecting advance instalments while still charging interest on the full loan amount.Recovering interest on full loan amounts, even in cases where the instalment was paid in advance, results in overcharging , as customers are paying interest on loan amounts they have not received or utilized. For example, if a customer takes out a loan of Rs10,000 and the repayment schedule requires monthly instalments over a period of 12 months, the lender collects two instalments in advance, totalling Rs2,000, at the time of loan disbursement . Despite only receiving Rs 8,000, the lender calculates interest charges based on the full Rs 10,000 loan amount.According to RBI, the 2003 guidelines on the Fair Practices Code advocate fairness and transparency in charging interest rates. However, these do not prescribe any standard practice with the objective of providing adequate freedom to lenders regarding their loan pricing policy.In its letter, RBI said that non-standard practices of charging interest “are not in consonance with the spirit of fairness and transparency”.","Customers end up paying interest on money they haven’t received, which inflates the cost of borrowing.

The finance minister set the stage for a ""Viksit Bharat by 2047"", on the core principles of ‘Sabka Saath’, ‘Sabka Vikas’, ‘Sabka Vishwas’, with ‘Sabka Prayas’ being added as a new theme in the interim Budget.This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data i.e., farmer welfare and N for Nari utthan i.e., support for women entrepreneurs.These form the pillars of a comprehensive inclusive development. The Government's commitment to sustainable development under the strategy for Amrit Kaal includes achieving 'Net Zero' by 2070, rooftop solarization for one crore households and robust health initiatives.The Indian economy's resilience takes center stage amidst positive indicators of declining current account deficit as a percentage of GDP, falling unemployment rates, and a notable rise in digital transactions. These statistics affirm the robustness of the economy, showcasing a trajectory of growth and stability.The achievements in taxation reforms are nothing short of remarkable, with direct tax collections more than trebling in the last decade, the number of tax return filers increasing by 2.4 times, average processing time of tax returns plummeting from 93 days in FY 2013-14 to an impressive 10 days in FY 2023-24, resulting in issuance of quick refunds. These are the results of consistent progressive measures thus obviating the need for, and rightly avoiding, any last-minute populist measures.No change in existing tax rates, both for direct and indirect taxes, is a good indicator of stability and predictability for investors and taxpayers.A welcome move to waive outstanding tax demands that are minor, disputed, and unreconciled. This involves the withdrawal of outstanding direct tax demands up to Rs. 25,000 pertaining to the period up to FY 2009-10 and up to Rs.10,000 for FY 2010-11 to 2014-15.The Government's commitment to fostering a business-friendly environment is evident in its intent to extend specific tax benefits for start-ups, investments by sovereign wealth funds/ pension funds, and certain IFSC units. The extension has been made now until March 31, 2025. This might help in creating a conducive landscape for business.To align with the CBDT notification issued earlier, the provisions relating to tax collection at source concerning remittances under the Liberalized Remittance Scheme have now been formally incorporated in the Finance Bill, 2024, setting the rate at 20% for amounts exceeding Rs. 7 lakhs in a financial year.The Finance Bill, 2024 proposes an extension of the time limit for introducing the faceless scheme by the Central Government for transfer pricing proceedings, DRP Proceedings, and ITAT Proceedings, up to March 31, 2025.The interim Budget 2024 may not have proposed significant tax announcements, but it very well positioned the prelude to the full budget post the upcoming elections. Considering the potential impact on the population across the four pillars of GYAN, a sizable portion of India stands to be covered. The interim Budget’s focus on the tax front resembles a report card, highlighting the maturity achieved by our tax system. The enhancement of taxpayer services was emphasized as a key priority.","This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data and N for Nari utthan.

Interim Budget for a Viksit Bharat: It’s for everyone and all,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/interim-budget-for-a-viksit-bharat-its-for-everyone-and-all/articleshow/107497439.cms,"By Akhilesh Tuteja

The Finance Minister on February 01, 2024, delivered a truly innovative interim budget. At first glance, it did not seem like an interim budget but looked more like the budget to drive further growth and a continuum of inclusive growth-oriented investments.At the outset, this budget brings a wonderful balance between fiscal prudence and continued investment for growth.It's not easy to continue the glide path of reducing the fiscal deficit and continuing to make significant investments in all areas including infrastructure, R&D, energy transition, technology, skilling, and social welfare. The surprising reduction in fiscal deficit of 5.8% as against the budgeted 5.9% for FY24 and the projection of 5.1% in FY25 with a clear focus on increasing investments was a huge positive.This was a budget for everyone and all because it caters to every part of the Indian economy and society. The FM has carefully catered to the investment needs of various sectors. The continued focus on youth, impoverished, women and farmers to increase their involvement and contribution to economic growth is evident. By committing an 11.1% increase in capital expenditure to 11,11,111 lakh crore, the FM has clearly brought every single 1 in this growth journey.What was very impressive was the inclusion strategy of the government. The focus on women's empowerment for the past few years is unprecedented, which is reflected in the inclusion of women in the workforce moving from 23.3% to 37% in the last five years. The thirty crore Mudra Yojna loans to women entrepreneurs were a great boost to the Nari Shakti initiative. We already have over 10 million Lakhpati Didis and what is truly evident is like a corporate CFO, the FM has revised the earlier target of 20 million Lakhpati Didis to 30 million. The government also plans to invest in initiatives to encourage young girls between the ages of 9 and 14 to undertake the vaccination for cervical cancer which is again a great boost to Nari Shakti.A lot needs to be done to bring more women into all parts of economic growth but the journey so far and the vision of the future is truly inspiring.While India continues on its technological prowess and makes its mark in new technologies like Artificial Intelligence, we need a multi-pronged strategy to harness the power of AI. We need a clear focus on building AI systems in India so that we not only emerge as a global leader in this new era but can build models, which are specific to India that will benefit Indians. At the same time, we need a very wide coverage program to build skills to leverage AI to its fullest potential. The biggest contribution we can make to the inclusion of youth in the economic development of the country is by skilling them in new skill areas. In the last few years, the Skill India Mission has trained 14 million youth, reskilled over 5 million youth and established a staggering 3,000 new ITIs. The future of any country will depend as much on capital investments as on skill investments.The focus on agricultural development and support to the farmer continues through direct financial assistance to farmers. The farmers have benefited by getting crop insurance through PM Fasal Bima Yojana. It's not just the farmers, the PM-SVANidhi provides credit assistance to a large number of street vendors.The last few years have seen the journey of affordable housing through Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY). There is a slight increase in allocation to launch a scheme for encouraging the middle class to build or buy new homes. This investment will likely propel a wider economic development and increase employment.India has seen a tremendous rise in entrepreneurship in the last few years. In order to continue the journey and promote new startups, the government proposes to extend certain tax benefits, which are expiring from March 2024 to March 2025. The MSMEs have not been left behind. With a proposal to provide timely finances to such enterprises, the government has paved the way for their growth, so they can look to compete globally.All in all, it’s a truly inclusive budget with a clear focus on development not just by giving away freebies but enabling the people to participate in the economic development activity. While the FM calls the comprehensive GDP - Governance, Development & Performance – to me, this budget is inclusive of another GDP – gender, demography, and professions.","Akhilesh Tuteja is Partner and Head, Clients and Markets, KPMG in India.

‘Enough domestic sources of demand to counter drag from external sector’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/enough-domestic-sources-of-demand-to-counter-drag-from-external-sector/articleshow/107372012.cms,"Do you think the

creates room for lower interest rates?

One of the issues that the Budget has flagged is the demographic challenge and opportunity and the societal change that is taking place. How do you view this?

Niti Aayog is working on the Viksit Bharat roadmap. What will be the focus areas?

You are as much a representative of the Centre as well as the states. Is it time to revisit the entire formula for transfers to states particularly on the issue of cesses and surcharges?

Suman Bery , who heads Niti Aayog , the govt think tank, is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China, which he says is also an opportunity for India. The economist is confident that Indian states remain resilient. Excerpts of the interview with TOI.The finance ministry expects the economy to grow 7% next year.Given the global situation, how do you see the prospects?The belief in the finance ministry is that we have a possible drag coming from the external sector but that we have other sources. We have enough domestic sources of demand. One has to applaud the political and economic judgment of FM in deciding that it was appropriate to pursue the path of fiscal consolidation. There is transparency. What this actually reflects is responsible economic management, which is one reason we are where we are. Second, it also creates a buffer so that there is policy space if we do encounter headwinds.That’s the hope and expectation. We have an independent central bank and an inflation targeting central bank, so it is up to the monetary policy committee to take a call through the monetary policy committee on the repo rate .The PM has said that when India grows its states grow. India is a composite of 37 states and UTs. They are each at very different points in their demographic transition. There are some states where the net replacement rate is down to 1%, like Kerala . There are others, particularly UP and Bihar, which are in their earliest stage of demographic transition and each one of these states is the size of a large European country. There are two implications of that — one is internal labour mobility and it will become an even larger part of our growth model. The govt has taken several steps to create a unified market. Our main endowment is our human capital and that has to be equipped to participate in global exchange in many ways. We know from China, Japan that the demographic dividend partly depends on markets and on human capital. But the golden period is fairly short lived, about 15 years, when the so called dependency ratio declines. The other big opportunity the PM has been highlighting is bringing women much more into the active labour force.When Niti was set up there was the idea of a three-year vision and a seven-year strategy paper. The reality is that schemes of govt tend to be aligned with the award of the Finance Commission . There are various established building blocks or hand holds which are already a matter of govt policy. The PM is much more interested in a national debate on what it means to be a Viksit Bharat or modern society. We have a collective goal and it is for the democratic polity to define what that goal should be. Its emphatically not for a super mandarin bureaucracy. It is not going to be Lee Kwan Yew’s Singapore led from the top.It’s entirely a finance ministry matter but I would be lying if I didn’t say when I visit certain states there is this complaint. A big frontier would be resource mobilisation at the state level. Second is going to be rationalisation of subsidies not only at the Union level, but also at the state level. All chief ministers sit on my governing council. When they convene as the governing council, I see them in their role as development practitioners. The world is beginning to appreciate quite how much institutional and political maturity India attained in our 75 years and the most fundamental dimension of a democracy, we have orderly transfers of power. There are enough buffers to ensure that what happens in state finances is unlikely to create macro instability. Those risks are well contained by our Constitution. The chief ministers know that they are going to be judged by development outcomes and so you can have the sugar rush of changing of pension plans or various handouts but if the cupboard is bare you are not going to be able to deliver.","Suman Bery is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China.

Government's Marathon to 2047: Emphasis on Fiscal Prudence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/governments-marathon-to-2047-emphasis-on-fiscal-prudence/articleshow/107371788.cms,"What was the thinking behind keeping the vote on account absolutely straight?

So is it the idea to keep the Budget completely transparent?

The capex has risen 11.1% and there is an emphasis on infrastructure spending. But there is also the hope that the private sector will now take over and start capital spending. Given the geopolitical situation, how confident is the govt that it will pan out as planned?

Finance secretary T V Somanathan, in an interview with TOI, says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047 . Excerpts:If you see the Budget speech you will see the emphasis on 2047. The govt has set its sight on running that marathon.Running to 2047 is a marathon , it’s not a sprint. If you are going to run a marathon, you need to be in good shape and you can’t have short-term stimulants or something that will get you some yards and then it’s done.The whole focus is on making India a developed country by 2047, for which a healthy present and a strong fiscal position is an important concomitant. Some purely short term measures don’t really fit into that picture. It’s a consistent picture: focus on the long term for which you need to build strength in the short term and that needs to be done by prudence in fiscal policy and by not doing things which can detract you from that path. Not doing the wrong thing is more important than appearing to do things.The idea is that govt finances may be good, bad or indifferent depending on the times, depending on the circumstances, depending on the policies. But what is the position should be reflected as reasonably and accurately as possible. That is an emphasis. As regards the Finance Commission, again the terms of reference that have been given to them are the terms in the Constitution.What is the means by which the devolution should be done is a matter they have full discretion. They can actually take all kinds of factors into account and in a sense we felt this time based on my review of the previous commissions that the right expression would be less is more. The shorter, less prescriptive terms of reference gives full scope for all stakeholders including state govts to express their viewpoints and for the commission to take a balanced view of the different perspectives and then come to its award. Ultimately the award of the Finance Commission is about devolution and grant for which full scope has now been given to them.n There are incipient signs of private capital expenditure accelerating. There are some surveys I have seen done by some of the chambers industry, which show high levels of investment. The PMI, which is a sort of leading indicator, is also looking pretty healthy. Capacity utilisation is one reason that private sector capital expenditure doesn’t immediately pick up when the economy starts accelerating because there is surplus capacity.But increasingly I get the sense that many industries are beginning to reach levels where they have to add capacity. When that happens capital investment will happen. Another pointer also mentioned in the Budget speech you may notice that our airlines have placed large orders for planes — that is capital expenditure.When you import 1,000 aircraft, it’s just not 1,000 aircraft, there are concomitant additions to ground handling facilities, you need airports to expand, you need to employ people to do that. That means a lot of jobs. The aircraft is capital but then look at the effect it is going to have on skilled jobs. So capital expenditure is happening. I am fairly confident that we will have decent capital expenditure in the year to come and that will become a new source of acceleration.",Finance secretary T V Somanathan says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047.

Income Tax Changes Budget 2024 : In the recent Budget 2024 speech, the Finance Minister kept the Section 80C tax deduction limit unchanged. The maximum limit for claiming tax benefits under Section 80C remains at Rs 1.5 lakh for the current fiscal year 2023-24 and will stay the same for individuals looking to save on taxes through Section 80C investments in the upcoming fiscal year 2024-25.Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions. Individuals can reduce their gross taxable income by up to Rs 1.5 lakh per financial year by engaging in these specific investments or expenditures.You can save on taxes through Section 80C by investing in things like Employees' Provident Fund (EPF), Public Provident Fund (PPF), Equity Linked Saving Scheme (ELSS) mutual funds, National Savings Certificate (NSC), and 5-year tax-saving fixed deposits with banks or post offices. Additionally, paying life insurance policy premiums also qualifies for tax benefits under Section 80C.It is important to note that each eligible investment comes with its specific maximum limit, rate of return, liquidity, and taxation rules for the earned returns, states ET in a report. For instance, the most you can invest in PPF in a financial year is Rs 1.5 lakh. Meanwhile, there's no limit on the amount you can invest in ELSS mutual funds, but the Section 80C deduction is capped at Rs 1.5 lakh.If individuals can't make specific investments, they can still get deductions under Section 80C from their gross taxable income through certain expenses. These expenses include repaying the principal amount of a home loan, tuition fees for children, payment of stamp duty, registration fees, and other costs related to buying a house.Since the financial year 2020-21, individuals without any business income must annually choose between the old and new tax regimes. As of the fiscal year 2023-24, the new tax regime is the default option. Consequently, individuals seeking tax deductions under Section 80C must opt for the old tax regime since this deduction isn't available in the new tax regime. It's crucial for taxpayers to be aware of these rules to make informed decisions about their tax planning and investment strategies.","Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget which is an interim budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year. The budget talks about inclusive development both, social and geographical, especially for youth, women, farmers, and the poor. Continued focus on improving logistics through infrastructure spend on roads, rail, airports, ports increases productivity for companies and citizens alike.To make ‘Viksit Bharat’ by 2047, the government’s focus is on improving and empowering people’s capabilities through various skilling initiatives. It is encouraging to see that Skill India Mission has succeeded in training more than 1.4 crore youth and upskilling and reskilling 54 lakh youth. I am particularly happy to see the continued focus on youth and women entrepreneurship and the announcement of a new fund which will give interest free 50 year loans for startups will provide a domestic fillip to startups supplementing venture capital we have traditionally relied on from abroad.PM Mudra Yojana has sanctioned 43 crore loans aggregating to 22.5 lakh crore to youth entrepreneurs and thirty crore Mudra Yojana loans to women entrepreneurs. There are several other schemes like Fund of Funds, Start-Up India, and Start-Up Credit Guarantee schemes that are assisting our youth. Further, the extension of tax benefits to Start-ups and investments made by sovereign wealth funds/pension funds, till 31st March 2025 depicts the government’s effort to support the startup eco- system.This aligns quite well with India Sanitation Coalition’s efforts to give impetus to the start-up world. Over the past 7 editions of our ISC-FICCI Sanitation Awards, we have recognized and promoted several start-ups in the sanitation space, many of whom are successful businesses now!While the finance minister did not provide detailed information on Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH), the budget allocation sees a slight increase in spend demonstrating continued focus on this highly successful program. The acknowledgement that the private sector has increasingly played a substantial role in addressing WASH issues in both urban and rural areas, with numerous projects underway through Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs), highlights the government's commitment to addressing challenges in this sector.A perfect example is the LightHouse Initiative initiated by the Department of Drinking Water along with the India Sanitation Coalition (ISC) by partnering with major corporates across India to develop model villages in Solid and Liquid Waste Management (SLWM) under SBM-Grameen. From this budget, there is an expectation that the government will persist in prioritizing Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) as the path toward achieving the country's Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6). Additionally, it is hoped that the government will uphold its commitment to making necessary infrastructural investments for SLWM.The budget speech rightly celebrates the fact that we have 83 lakh SHGs and 9 crore women beneficiaries. The microfinance movement in the country and the possibility of empowering women members of SHGs through livelihood skilling is a key to bringing women into mainstream economic advancement.The focus on green growth, rooftop solar, wind, biomass, e-vehicles all help with our green energy thrust. The tourism sector was mentioned and could be a huge job provider for youth and women.Guided by the principle ‘Reform, Perform, and Transform’, the budget emphasizes efficient implementation of various policies by improving coordination with states and relevant stakeholders. This is critical both for infra spend and social programsIt is noteworthy that ISC’s Climate Resilient Coastal Cities project which is being implemented in PPP (Public-Private Partnership) mode in four coastal states of Karnataka, Gujarat, Goa and Maharashtra is congruent with the government’s priority of promoting climate-resilient activities for the blue economy 2.0, a scheme for restoration and adaptation measures, and coastal aquaculture.The budget also focuses on the Aspirational districts program where assistance will be given to the states for faster development of aspirational districts and blocks, including the generation of ample economic opportunities. This is again very crucial as it has a huge potential to transform the landscape of our country while making sure no -one is left behind.Overall, this budget has embraced economic strategies and develops the building blocks that nurture and uphold growth, promote inclusive and sustainable development, and enhance productivity.","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year.

Earlier, companies/ LLPs would qualify as 'eligible startups' for tax exemptions under section 80-IAC only if they were incorporated before March 31, 2024.The Budget extended this by a year.Similarly, in case of sovereign wealth funds, the timeline to make investments qualifying for exemptions has also been extended by a year.

Two foreign banks optimistic on BJP show,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/two-foreign-banks-optimistic-on-bjp-show/articleshow/109709099.cms,"MUMBAI:Two multinational banks, Nomura and HSBC , have said that the upcoming general elections in India polls point to continuity at the Centre, and have called for tougher reforms, including those related to land and labour, to spur growth.The reports coincided with finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s statement, underscoring the need for a stable govt to achieve the goal of becoming a developed country by 2047.“We have to make efforts, so the GDP grows, and the benefits reach to all. GDP growth doesn’t happen automatically... efforts are required at micro and macro levels and on the ground,” she said at a university in Vizag.In a research report, Nomura analysts Sonal Varma and Aurodeep Nandi said opinion polls were pointing towards continuity in the Lok Sabha polls, which also suggests policy continuity. While estimating average annual GDP growth of 7% between 2024-28, Nomura said, govt may consider the more politically contentious reforms around land, labour, and capital, judicial reforms, as well as simplifying direct and indirect tax administration, including bringing electricity, oil & gas, and alcohol under the GST ambit.HSBC economist Pranjul Bhandari went a step further to suggest that BJP’s tally may increase from 303 in 2019 to 323 seats this time, with the NDA coalition reaching 377.Bhandari said that implementing easy-to-moderate reforms can deliver 6.5% growth over the medium term. “For growth over 7.5%, moderate-to-hard reforms will be necessary,” the HSBC report said.The report categorises infrastructure, facilitating business in electronics and EVs, and privatising some PSUs as easy reforms. Moderate reforms entail improving local govt funding, simplifying tax systems, and upgrading infrastructure financing models. Difficult reforms involve subsidies, implementing land and labour reforms, and modernising education and healthcare systems.PM Narendra Modi has asked civil servants to ready a 100-day plan that he intends to announce if he secures a third term in office. The pace of reforms — as well as decisions related to privatisation and asset monetisation — have slowed down for over a year as govt got into the election mode.BJP has gone to town on the economic performance, something Sitharaman also underlined on Monday as she sought to rebut her predeces sor P Chidambaram’s claims.The Nomura report suggested that India will remain the fastest growing major economy, expanding 6.6% this fiscal. In its monthly economic review, think tank NCAER said that India was on course to grow at a pace of over 7%.“These high frequency indicators, coupled with a more benign global outlook projected by the IMF and WTO, bode well for the Indian economy during the current year… Projected acceleration in both global growth and trade volumes as well as forecast of an above normal monsoon indicate that the Indian economy can again attain growth rates higher than 7% during the current fiscal,” said NCAER director general Poonam Gupta.",HSBC economist Pranjul Bhandari said that implementing easy-to-moderate reforms can deliver 6.5% growth over the medium term.

"Furniture super kings, Tamil Nadu retailers betting big on branding",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/furniture-super-kings-tamil-nadu-retailers-betting-big-on-branding/articleshow/109671259.cms,"Gone are the days when carpenters went to homes to make furniture or people went to a local store to pick up what they needed. Branded retail showrooms are coming up everywhere and Tamil Nadu-based companies are giving big names a run for their money.The concept of branding picked up in furniture retail in the state after the launch of Woodpecker Furniture two decades ago by S Swaminathan and S Vijayalakshmi.“We wanted to make a difference in the market in terms of product, policy, service and transparency 20 years ago. That’s the reason for promoting and establishing a brand,” says Swaminathan, managing director, Woodpecker Furniture. “Furniture is associated with wood and woodpecker is a common bird and, hence, we chose the name as our brand,” he adds.Commencing operations from a house after the couple returned from Indonesia, the company has expanded with three branches in Chennai. It is foraying into six districts including Thanjavur, Trichy, Madurai and Coimbatore in the current financial year. Retail showrooms are key in the furniture trade as customers visit them to check out the various brands for their product category before making a choice. This is in contrast to the white goods and electronic gadgets market, where people make a decision on the specific product brand and later visit retail stores to purchase them.Coimbatore-based Newmen’s Furniture & Homestyle, which started off as a furniture manufacturer in 1974 and opened its first retail showroom 25 years later, ventured into the branding exercise much later in 2017. Thanks to branding, it has expanded to Salem, as well. Its chairman J Ramanathan says, branding is the need of the hour as people have got an awareness about it. “For instance, we market four top international brands -- Kuka, Ashley, Dash Square and Natuzzi. Customers, who want to buy such premium brands also look at whether the shops selling the products are also branded,” he says.Another Coimbatore-headquartered company, Repose Mattress, which largely manufactures mattresses and entered cot making on a small scale, is setting up standalone retail experience centres in Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Coimbatore. “Retail showrooms are taking branding on a big scale because the unorganised furniture market is tilting towards organised segment. Moreover, branding creates trust among the customers and it is vital in our sector because furniture is used for a long period,” says Balaji V, director - marketing, Repose Mattress.The value of the Indian furniture market is pegged at $32 billion, with a compound annual growth rate of 20-25%. Industry sources estimate that Tamil Nadu would account for about 10% of the country’s furniture market.Rural-focussed Darling Retail markets a mix of home appliances, electronic gadgets and furniture. Of the 138 branches across Tamil Nadu and Puducherry, 75 stores are offering furniture sales for the past 15 years. Its director V Navin says branding is the USP. “We offer some unique services such as bringing experience centres available largely in the metros to the rural centres and 30-month EMIs on furniture. We have also launched our own furniture brand,” he adds.Founder of 56-year-old furniture brand Sathya Furniture in Chennai, G Santhanapathy says, “Apart from brand, quality and trust are alsoimportant because we get customers generation after generation,” adds Santhanapathy, who is also president of Tamil Nadu FurnitureManufacturers’ and Traders Association.","The value of the Indian furniture market is pegged at $32 billion, with a compound annual growth rate of 20-25%.

The company, which till a few years back was struggling to get its act together with previous-gen Scorpio as its only flagship, has staged a turnaround and emerged as the revenue leader in the SUV category , ahead of some of its formidable rivals such as Toyota, Hyundai, Tata Motors, Kia and Maruti Suzuki.Mahindra has been on a roll since the success of models such as the XUV7OO , Thar, and Scorpio-N.. The company’s revenues in the SUV business in FY23-24 stood at Rs 72,109.5 crore compared to second-biggest player Hyundai’s Rs 50,421 crore in the same period. Maruti Suzuki, which has also made a dent in the SUV business, had revenue of Rs 47,706 crore in FY24, according to JATO Dynamics.For Mahindra, weighted average per unit (it sold 4.6 lakh SUVs in 2023-24), was Rs 15.7 lakh compared to Rs 13 lakh for Hyundai (total SUV sales at 3.9 lakh units), and Maruti’s Rs 10.7 lakh (4.4 lakh SUVs).Tata Motors’ revenue from SUVs was Rs 45,597 crore, with weighted average per car at Rs 11.7 lakh (total SUV sales at 3.8 lakh units), JATO said.Mahindra on Monday drove in entry SUV XUV 3XO to take on Brezza and Nexon.

Beware! You're going through century's longest heatwave,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/youre-going-through-centurys-longest-heatwave/articleshow/109677919.cms,"KOLKATA: The city is unlikely to get any respite from the heat for about a week. Kolkata's maximum temperature could stay above 40°C for the next two days, making 2024 get this century's highest number of April heatwave days. Sunday's maximum temperature of 41.3°C marked the seventh day this month with above 40°C temperature since the heatwave started on April 19.Between 1998 and 2024, April 2009 and April 2016 each had eight days when the maximum temperature touched or crossed 40°C. So far, seven out of nine days since the onset of the heatwave have seen the mercury crossing the 40°C-mark this month. On Sunday, the Met office issued two bulletins stating that the heatwave conditions are likely to prevail till at least May 2 and that there was no indication of rainfall in Kolkata till at least May 5.According to Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC) head Somenath Dutta, there is a slim chance of a thunderstorm in the city between May 5 and 6. This would be the first instance of rain since the city's last spell of 0.5 mm on April 7 and could perhaps bring down the mercury several notches, relieving the city from at least 15 consecutive days of heatwave conditions.""I have observed an anticlockwise turn in the southerly winds in the Bay of Bengal, which tends to be conducive for thunderstorm activity. While we need a few more days to observe the system, if the trend continues, there may be a mature thunderstorm between May 5 and 6, bringing substantial cold and dry winds, which would, in turn, push the mercury down,"" Dutta said.While Kolkata's heat is well on its way to break a recordthis week, this April has already broken the record for the highest temperature in 44 years. Last Thursday, the maximum temperature hit 41.6°C, the highest the city has seen in April since it touched 41.7°C on April 25, 1980. In recent years, the mercury crossed 41°C only seven times - in 2009, 2014, 2016 and 2023. Meanwhile, this month has already seen three days where the mercury shot past the 41°C-mark.""Over the last few days, we have been seeing an increasing flow of cool southerly wind from the Bay of Bengal, countering the hot dry northwesterly wind. While this is not sufficient to cause a thunderstorm, it's influence curtails the temperature from rising significantly. Most likely, for the next four to five days, the temperature is likely to stagnate rather than increase further,"" Dutta added.Monday is likely to remain sunny, and partly cloudy in the later afternoon, while the maximum and minim-um temperatures are likely to remain near 41°C and 29°C respectively.","Sunday's maximum temperature of 41.3°C marked the seventh day this month with above 40°C temperature since the heatwave started on April 19.

He cannot commit suicide.""They pointed out that the wound on his neck was too deep to have been caused by hanging and demanded an autopsy by a medical board.The hostel room where the incident occurred did not have an anti-suicide device installed with the ceiling fan, which is a gross violation of safety norms and could have prevented the tragedy.

Sanctions warning

'Channel can be shut'

An appliance maker in southern China is finding it hard to ship its products to Russia , not because of any problems with the gadgets but because China's big banks are throttling payments for such transactions out of concern over US sanctions.To settle payments for its electrical goods, the Guangdong-based company is considering using currency brokers active along China's border with Russia, said the company's founder, Wang, who asked to be identified only by his family name.The US has imposed an array of sanctions on Russia and Russian entities since the country invaded Ukraine in 2022.Now the threat of extending these to banks in China - a country Washington blames for ""powering"" Moscow's war effort - is chilling the finance that lubricates even non-military trade from China to Russia.This is posing a growing problem for small Chinese exporters, said seven trading and banking sources familiar with the situation.As China's big banks pull back from financing Russia-related transactions, some Chinese companies are turning to small banks on the border and underground financing channels such as money brokers - even banned cryptocurrency - the sources told Reuters.Others have retreated entirely from the Russian market, the sources said.""You simply cannot do business properly using the official channels,"" Wang said, as big banks now take months rather than days to clear payments from Russia, forcing him to tap unorthodox payment channels or shrink his business.A manager at a large state-owned bank he previously used told Wang the lender was worried about possible US sanctions in dealing with Russian transactions, Wang said.A banker at one of China's Big Four state banks said it had tightened scrutiny of Russia-related businesses to avert sanctions risk. ""The main reason is to avoid unnecessary troubles,"" said the banker, who asked not to be named.Since last month, Chinese banks have intensified their scrutiny of Russia-related transactions or halted business altogether to avoid being targeted by US sanctions, the sources said.""Transactions between China and Russia will increasingly go through underground channels,"" said the head of a trade body in a southeastern province that represents Chinese businesses with Russian interests. ""But these methods carry significant risks.""Making payments in crypto, banned in China since 2021, might be the only option, said a Moscow-based Russian banker, as ""it's impossible to pass through KYC (know-your-customer) at Chinese banks, big or small"".The sources spoke on condition of anonymity, citing the sensitivity of the topic. Reuters could not determine the extent of transactions that had shifted from major banks to more obscure routes.China's foreign ministry is not aware of the practices described by the businesspeople to arrange payments or troubles in settling payments through major Chinese banks, a spokesperson said, referring questions to ""the relevant authorities"".The People's Bank of China and the National Financial Regulatory Administration, the country's banking sector regulator, did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken , after meeting China's top diplomat Wang Yi for five and a half hours in Beijing on Friday, said he had expressed ""serious concern"" that Beijing was ""powering Russia's brutal war of aggression against Ukraine"".Still, his visit, which included meeting President Xi Jinping , was the latest in a series of steps that have tempered the public acrimony that drove relations between the world's biggest economies to historic lows last year.While officials have warned that the United States was ready to take action against Chinese financial institutions facilitating trade in goods with dual civilian and military applications and the US preliminarily has discussed sanctions on some Chinese banks, a US official told Reuters last week Washington does not yet have a plan to implement such measures.The Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said, ""China does not accept any illegal, unilateral sanctions. Normal trade cooperation between China and Russia is not subject to disruption by any third party.""A State Department spokesperson, asked about Reuters findings that Chinese banks were curbing payments from Russia and the impact on some Chinese companies, said, ""Fuelling Russia's defence industrial base not only threatens Ukrainian security, it threatens European security.""Beijing cannot achieve better relations with Europe while supporting the greatest threat to European security since the end of the Cold War,"" the spokesperson said.Blinken made clear to Chinese officials ""that ensuring transatlantic security is a core US interest,"" the spokesperson said. ""If China does not address this problem, the United States will.""Nearly all major Chinese banks have suspended settlements from Russia since the beginning of March, said a manager at a listed electronics company in Guangdong.Some of the biggest state-owned lenders have reported drops in Russia-related business, reversing a surge in assets after Russia's invasion.Among the Big Four, China Construction Bank posted a drop of 14% in its Russian subsidiary's assets last year and Agricultural Bank of China a 7% decline, according to their latest filings.By contrast, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China , the country's biggest lender, reported a 43% jump in assets of its Russian unit. Bank of China (BOC), the fourth-largest, did not give the breakdown.The four banks did not respond to requests for comment on their Russian businesses or the impact on Chinese companies.Some rural banks in northeast China along the Russian border can still collect payments, but this has led to a bottleneck, with some businesspeople saying they have been lining up for months to open accounts.A chemical and machinery company in Jiangsu province has been waiting for three months to open an account at Jilin Hunchun Rural Commercial Bank in the northeastern province of Jilin, said Liu, who works at the firm and also asked to be identified by family name.Calls to the bank seeking comment went unanswered.BOC has blocked a payment from Liu's Russian clients since February, and a bank loan officer said firms exporting heavy equipment face more stringent reviews in receiving payments, Liu said.The manager at the listed Guangdong company said their firm had opened accounts at seven banks since last month but none agreed to accept payments from Russia.""We gave up on the Russian market,"" the manager said. ""We eventually didn't receive more than 10 million yuan ($1.4 million) in payments from the Russian side, and we just gave up. The process of collecting payments is extremely annoying.""Wang is also having second thoughts about his Russian business.""I may gradually shrink my business in Russia as the slow process of collecting money is not good for the company's liquidity management,"" he said.""What's more, you don't know what will happen in the future. The channel can be shut completely one day.""",China's big banks are throttling payments for such transactions out of concern over US sanctions.

China's share in India's industrial goods imports jump to 30% from 21% in last 15 years: GTRI,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/chinas-share-in-indias-industrial-goods-imports-jump-to-30-from-21-in-last-15-years-gtri/articleshow/109666106.cms,"NEW DELHI: A recent report by the economic think tank Global Trade Research Initiative ( GTRI ) highlights India's rising reliance on Chinese industrial products like telecom, machinery, and electronics. Over the past 15 years, Beijing's share in New Delhi's imports of these goods has increased from 21% to 30%. This growing trade deficit with China raises concerns, with significant implications for both economic stability and national security.From 2019 to 2024, India's exports to China have stagnated at around USD 16 billion annually, while imports from China have surged from USD 70.3 billion in 2018-19 to over USD 101 billion in 2023-24, resulting in a cumulative trade deficit exceeding USD 387 billion over five years.Ajay Srivastava, founder of GTRI, emphasized the need for the Indian government and industries to reassess their import strategies. He suggested fostering diversified and resilient supply chains to mitigate economic risks. This, he stressed, would not only support domestic industries but also reduce dependency on single-country imports, particularly from geopolitical competitors like China.""Over the last 15 years, China's share in India's industrial product imports has increased significantly, from 21 per cent to 30 per cent.""This growth in imports from China has been much faster than India's overall import growth, with China's exports to India growing 2.3 times faster than India's total imports from all other countries,"" the report said.In the fiscal year 2023-24, India's total merchandise imports reached USD 677.2 billion, with China contributing USD 101.8 billion. This indicates that China constituted 15% of India's overall imports. Of these imports from China, USD 100 billion, equivalent to 98.5%, comprised major industrial product categories.""When compared to India's global imports of these industrial products, which total USD 337 billion, China's contribution is quite significant, representing 30 per cent of India's imports in this sector. Fifteen years ago, China's share was just 21 per cent,"" it added.New Delhi's growing dependence is particularly notable in key sectors such as electronics, telecom, electrical products, machinery, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, iron, steel, base metals, plastics, textiles, clothing, automobiles, medical supplies, leather goods, paper, glass, ships, aircraft, and other remaining categories. From April to January in the fiscal year 2023-24, the electronics, telecom, and electrical products sector witnessed the highest import value, totaling USD 67.8 billion, with China accounting for USD 26.1 billion of that amount.""This represents a substantial 38.4 per cent of the total imports in this category, indicating a heavy dependence on Chinese electronic goods and components,"" it said.In the machinery sector, China's contribution amounts to USD 19 billion, representing 39.6% of India's imports in this category. This underscores China's significant role as a machinery supplier to India, noted Srivastava.India's chemical and pharmaceutical imports totaled USD 54.1 billion during the period, with China accounting for USD 15.8 billion, or 29.2%. This highlights China's importance as a provider of chemical and pharmaceutical products to India.Similarly, in the plastics and related articles sector, total imports amount to USD 18.5 billion, with China supplying goods worth USD 4.8 billion, comprising 25.8% of total imports in this sector.Srivastava also highlighted that half of India's imports from China consist of capital goods and machinery, emphasizing the critical need for focused research and development in this area.He emphasized the urgency of upgrading industries related to intermediate goods like organic chemicals, APIs (Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients), and plastics, which constitute 37% of imports. Meanwhile, consumer goods account for 12% of imports, with raw materials representing less than 1%.The report highlighted that numerous products imported from China, including textiles, apparel, glassware, furniture, paper, shoes, and toys, belong to categories dominated by micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs). It suggested that many of these items could potentially be manufactured domestically.""Overall, India imports a broad array of products from China, from high to low technology items, highlighting significant gaps in India's industrial capabilities across various sectors,"" it added.Chinese companies have significant involvement in India's energy, telecommunications, and transportation sectors, playing vital roles in areas such as smartphones, electronics, electric and passenger vehicles, solar energy, and engineering projects. According to the report, while imports were previously conducted by Indian firms, the entry of Chinese companies into the Indian market is expected to lead to a rapid increase in industrial product imports.""As the Chinese firms operating in India will prefer sourcing most requirements from their parent firms, Indian imports will rise sharply. For example, in the next few years, every third electric vehicle (EV) and many passenger and commercial vehicles on Indian roads could be those made by Chinese firms in India alone or through joint ventures with Indian firms,"" the report said.The large-scale entry of Chinese automakers into India will impact the domestic auto/EV manufacturers, firms working in the EV value chain space and battery development, it added.","A recent report by the economic think tank Global Trade Research Initiative ( GTRI ) highlights India's rising reliance on Chinese industrial products.

China’s economy is battling a barrage of challenges, including a deepening housing slump, fears of a deflationary spiral and high levels of youth unemployment. As China grapples with a myriad of economic challenges , the government is taking significant steps to tighten its belt, particularly among public officials. Amid concerns of an economic slowdown, soaring debt levels, and faltering consumer confidence, China is now enforcing a frugal lifestyle on its public servants in an effort to redirect resources toward more critical areas of need.In response to economic distress, characterized by a $2 trillion loss in stock market value since 2022 and debt levels nearing three times the national economic output, Chinese authorities have initiated widespread budget cuts across provincial governments.For instance, the governor of Guizhou province has pledged to slash his administration’s operating expenses by 15%. Similarly, in Hunan, officials are urged to embody the spirit of ""red housekeepers,"" a term coined to inspire cost-efficient governance that honors the Communist Party's revolutionary roots, a Wall Street Journal report said.The campaign for frugality has resulted in various stringent measures aimed at curbing unnecessary spending. In Yunnan, for instance, a directive has been issued to set air conditioning thermostats no lower than 26 degrees Celsius (79 degrees Fahrenheit) during summer to save on electricity costs. Meanwhile, in Inner Mongolia, authorities are promoting the repair and reuse of office equipment like desks and chairs instead of purchasing new ones.As per the WSJ report, in recent weeks, numerous local governments have rolled out comprehensive guidelines on how to ""get used to living frugally."" These directives instruct staff to economize by utilizing public transport, opting for less expensive stationery, and printing documents in black-and-white and on both sides of the paper. Additional measures include directives for bureaucrats to consume all their food, reduce work-related travel, and extend the lifespan of resources by repairing and reusing everything from official vehicles to office furniture.At a state-owned ironworks in Yunnan, party officials have called for a 30% reduction in annual drinking water expenses compared to last year's expenditure of 270,000 yuan. The plant's party committee issued a directive saying, “Strictly control the consumption of bottled water in each work unit,” and encouraged employees to use their own cups instead of disposable ones to further cut costs, the WSJ report said.These austerity measures are part of a broader strategy to manage the economic fallout from three years of stringent Covid-19 containment measures and a slumping property market, which have severely depleted local government coffers. This fiscal tightening is further compounded by the reduction in land-sale revenues—a key source of income for many localities.The frugality campaign aligns with Chinese leader Xi Jinping 's broader efforts initiated in 2019 to curb government waste. This campaign not only seeks to alleviate fiscal pressures but also serves a significant political purpose, signaling the government's commitment to sharing the burden of economic slowdown. Senior officials and state media have bolstered this message, appealing to public servants' patriotism and framing frugality as a virtue that aligns with the Communist Party’s values. Historical references to past leaders' simple lifestyles are frequently invoked to strengthen this narrative.Despite these efforts, some experts, like Christine Wong, a visiting professor at the National University of Singapore’s East Asian Institute, view these measures as largely symbolic. They argue that the savings from such cuts are relatively minor compared to the broader challenges facing the Chinese economy, such as the need for substantial reforms in local government revenue generation and debt management. Critics contend that while these frugal measures may yield some savings, they do little to address the underlying structural issues that threaten China's long-term economic stability, the WSJ report said.(With inputs from agencies)",China is enforcing a frugal lifestyle on its public servants in an effort to redirect resources toward more critical areas of need.

These austerity measures are part of a broader strategy to manage the economic fallout from three years of stringent Covid-19 containment measures.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109641552,imgsize-49508,width-400,resizemode-4/109641552.jpg"
Tesla autopilot probed after 20 crashes in months since recall,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/tesla-autopilot-probed-after-20-crashes-in-months-since-recall/articleshow/109629790.cms,"The top US auto-safety regulator is again investigating Tesla Inc.’s Autopilot, this time over whether a fix deployed months ago did enough to stop people from misusing the system.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration disclosed Friday that it’s opened a query into the Autopilot recall Tesla conducted in December. The agency is concerned as to whether the company’s remedy was sufficient, in part due to 20 crashes that have occurred involving vehicles that received Tesla’s over-the-air software update .More than 2 million Tesla vehicles are subject to the probe, according to NHTSA . The carmaker’s shares fell as much as 1.7% shortly after the start of regular trading and are down more than 30% this year.The investigation cuts against Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk ’s exuberance about Tesla’s automated-driving systems . The billionaire has set a date in August to unveil a driverless robotaxi, which he said five years ago would be ready by 2020. During an earnings call this week, he downplayed the difficulty of getting the green light from regulators for that vehicle.“I actually do not think that there will be significant regulatory barriers, provided there is conclusive data that the autonomous car is safer than a human-driven car,” Musk said. Later in the call, he said that those who doubt Tesla’s ability to “solve” autonomy shouldn’t invest in the company.Tesla filed its Autopilot recall in December to address concerns NHTSA raised as part of a years-long defect investigation. A portion of the company’s remedy both requires car owners to opt in and allows drivers to readily reverse changes Tesla has made, according to the agency.The carmaker also has deployed Autopilot updates separate from the one disclosed in its December recall that appear to be related to concerns NHTSA had raised as part of its defect probe , the agency said. The latest query will consider why these updates weren’t a part of the recall, NHTSA said.Tesla has taken heat before from NHTSA over deploying software updates to Autopilot without filing a recall. The company did so in September 2021 weeks after the agency opened its defect investigation into the driving system.",More than 2 million Tesla vehicles are subject to the probe. The carmaker's shares fell as much as 1.7% shortly after the start of regular trading. The investigation cuts against Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk ’s exuberance about Tesla’s automated-driving systems.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109630687,imgsize-21258,width-400,resizemode-4/109630687.jpg"
