Budget 2024 expectations : Ahead of the upcoming Union Budget 2024 presentation on July 23 by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman , the government is weighing a proposal to significantly raise the minimum guaranteed amount under its flagship social security initiative , the Atal Pension Yojana (APY).Currently, the scheme offers a guaranteed minimum pension ranging from Rs 1,000 to Rs 5,000 per month, depending on the subscriber's contributions.However, according to an ET report, in a move aimed at enhancing social security benefits, the Modi government is contemplating doubling this amount to Rs 10,000 per month. The decision on this proposal is expected closer to the budget date.The potential hike in APY benefits comes amidst efforts to strengthen India's social security framework, aligning with the imminent rollout of the labour code on social security.As of June 20, the Atal Pension Yojana has garnered over 66.2 million enrolments, with 12.2 million new accounts added in the fiscal year 2023-24 alone.""Some proposals have been made for making the Atal Pension Yojana more attractive, including increasing the guaranteed amount. These are being examined,"" commented an official.Also Read | Budget 2024: Insurance cover under Ayushman Bharat PMJAY scheme to be doubled to Rs 10 lakh? Earlier this year, Deepak Mohanty, Chairman of the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA), highlighted the need to enhance the guaranteed pension amount, citing concerns over its adequacy in meeting future needs.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has previously underscored APY's success in targeting the poor and lower-middle-class segments, noting the scheme's deliberate design to ensure widespread affordability and accessibility.Introduced as part of the National Pension System (NPS), Atal Pension Yojana allows subscribers to exit the scheme at the age of 60, with options for annuitisation of pension wealth upon retirement. Notably, individuals liable to pay income tax are excluded from enrolling in the scheme, reinforcing its focus on supporting economically disadvantaged groups.","The government is weighing a proposal to significantly raise the minimum guaranteed amount under its flagship social security initiative, the Atal Pension Yojana.

The Vizhinjam International Sea Port , India's largest transhipment port in Kerala, has welcomed its first container ship, a large cargo vessel named 'San Fernando' from China. The ship's arrival was celebrated with a water salute by four tugs that guided it to the dock, marking a significant milestone for India's largest transhipment port.The ship, with a capacity of 8,000 to 9,000 TEUs, is owned by the prominent shipping company Maersk and arrived from Xiamen Port in China.The 300-meter-long San Fernando is set to unload 1,900 containers at Vizhinjam International Seaport Limited (VISL).The mothership carries large containers that will be transferred to other vessels and subsequently transported to various ports within the country and internationally.Vizhinjam, equipped with state-of-the-art equipment and advanced automation and IT systems, is poised to become India's first semi-automated port.Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd (APSEZ) is responsible for the development of the Vizhinjam International Seaport. Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan acknowledged Adani Group's commitment to completing the project within the stipulated timeframe.The port's construction, which commenced in 2016, is a public-private partnership project with a total investment of Rs 8,867 crore.

Budget 2024 income tax expectations: Why new tax regime is likely to be made more attractive,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2024-income-tax-expectations-why-new-tax-regime-is-likely-to-be-made-more-attractive/articleshow/111717575.cms,"By Tanu Gupta

Popularizing the New and Simplified Personal Tax Regime

Increasing the standard deduction

Direct payment of income tax refund to overseas bank accounts

(The author is Partner Mainstay Tax Advisors LLP. Views expressed are personal)

Budget 2024 income tax expectations : Increase in the limits of various exemptions and deductions is one of the prime expectations of the individual taxpayers from any Union Budget. But with the current government’s focus on a simplified tax regime with minimal exemptions and deductions, do the taxpayers need to adjust their old-time favorite expectation ? Should the taxpayer expect tax reliefs in the New Tax Regime instead ? Either way, the individual taxpayers have high hopes from this Budget, especially in the absence of any tax proposals announced in the interim budget in Feb 2024.In this article, I list some of the expectations of individual taxpayers from the Union Budget 2024 to be presented on 23 July 2024.A New Personal Tax Regime was introduced in Budget 2020 which was simple, in the sense that it allowed for very limited exemptions and deductions. To increase the takers for this regime and make it more tax beneficial for them, the Government then brought several changes in the new regime. Such as allowing standard deduction , higher basic exemption limit of Rs 3 lakh (as against Rs 2.5 lakh in the old regime), wider tax slabs, reduced surcharge from 37% to 25% on incomes above Rs 5 crore, nil tax liability for individuals with incomes up to Rs 7 lakh etc.The government further made it a default tax regime w.e.f. FY 2023-24, continuing to move to its vision of a simplified tax system in India.Marching towards the same goal, I expect that the government may propose further changes in the regime, to attract even those taxpayers who are still opting for the old tax regime. This may involve either further relaxing the slabs by widening them or restructuring them. Currently, 30% tax rate is applicable on incomes above Rs 15 lakh. The government may increase the same to Rs 20 lakh.Also Read | Budget 2024: Government may offer guarantee under NPS to allay fears Standard deduction is a vanilla / blanket tax deduction allowed to the salaried taxpayers, irrespective of the expenses or investments done by them.To provide further tax relief to the salaried taxpayers while keeping the tax system simple, I expect that the government may increase the standard deduction from Rs 50,000 to Rs 75,000 under the new tax regime.The income tax return form provides for mentioning the foreign bank account for direct credit of income tax refund, where the Non-Resident taxpayer does not have an Indian bank account. However, practically, such a facility is not yet active and the refunds cannot be credited to the foreign bank account for the NR taxpayer.Also Read | Income Tax expectations Budget 2024: Tax exempt limit for savings account interest to be raised to Rs 25,000? With a focus to improve taxpayer services and increasing use of technology and digital platforms in the tax system, I hope that the government activates the facility of direct credit of tax refund to foreign bank accounts.With India on its track to “Viksit Bharat” by 2047, and with a high growth target, the Government may put more disposable income in the hands of taxpayers, so as to further fuel consumption and growth of the economy. Therefore, one may expect some tax reliefs in the Union Budget 2024, however, they may continue to be along the same theme followed in earlier budgets – simplifying and rationalizing the India tax system!","Budget 2024 income tax expectations: Increase in the limits of various exemptions and deductions is one of the prime expectations of the individual taxpayers from any Union Budget.

No change in plan despite new UK government: Tata Steel,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/no-change-in-plan-despite-new-uk-government-tata-steel/articleshow/111767884.cms,"MUMBAI: Tata Steel 's strategy for its UK operations will remain unchanged amid concerns that its restructuring could face delays under the new Labour government that has come to power after a decade.In September 2023, the previous govt led by the Conservative party had agreed to grant 500 million pounds to Tata Steel to help it transition from the carbon emission intensive blast furnace to green steelmaking through electric arc furnaces.However, the deal wasn't formalised during the party's term.On Monday, responding to Tata Steel shareholders' questions on the impact of the change in UK govt on its transition plans there, company chairman N Chandrasekaran said he doesn't see any change in strategy, indicating that the metals giant will shut down its ageing blast furnaces at its Port Talbot , Wales plant, which would result in thousands of people losing their jobs.Tata Steel had acquired the UK plant as part of its acquisition of the Corus Group in April 2007 for 6.2 billion pounds and since then, the unit has hardly made any money for the Indian company.""We have had good discussions with both the previous and current govt. And we have been working closely with govt, the unions and local govt in Wales.

US inflation broadly cools, likely sealing deal for fed rate cut

Read about the latest US inflation update for June, showing a slowdown in housing costs and the potential for interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Core consumer prices rose slightly, paving the way for policy changes in the coming months.

NEW DELHI: Wholesale price inflation surged to a 16-month high in June as food and manufactured product prices shot up.Data released by the commerce and industry ministry on Monday showed inflation, as measured by the wholesale price index, rose an annual 3.4% in June from 2.6% in May. Food inflation hit double digits at 10.9% in June from 9.8% in May.Inflation in vegetables rose 38.8% in June, while pulses rose 21.6%. Potato prices shot up 66.4% and onion surged 93.4%.Experts expect the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to delay any interest rate cut for now, given the pressure of food prices on retail inflation.“Both wholesale and retail price indices are overwhelmingly being driven by food. CPI inflation crossing the 5% mark in June was largely due to elevated food inflation. While industrial costs are rising, the impact of this is not yet fully reflected in core CPI inflation (core CPI inflation rose marginally to 3.1% in June from 3% in May),” Barclays said in a note“The central bank is likely to remain hawkish over persistently elevated food inflation. While we expect a window for monetary easing to open in Dec 2024, we note a risk of rate cuts being pushed to 2025 if growth remains on a strong footing or if the inflation surge is stronger than expected by the bank,” Barclays said.Retail inflation rose to a four-month high in June, led by a spurt in prices of food and beverages, delaying any prospects of interest rate cuts for now.Data released by the National Statistical office (NSO) on Friday showed retail inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, rose an annual 5.1% in June, faster than the 4.8% in May and higher than the 4.9% in June 2023.

Budget 2024 expectations : India’s robust automotive industry is accelerating through a landscape transitioning in terms of demand, policy and technology. Given these variables, Budget 2024 will be crucial for the industry for three reasons.One, while the industry was rebounding after the Covid-19 pandemic, passenger and commercial vehicles faced growth hurdles, such as supply-chain disruptions, semiconductor shortage and a steep rise in commodity prices.Then in fiscal 2023 pent-up demand gushed forth and continued to chug along last fiscal. The industry could thus shake off degrowth and low-capacity utilization. Yet, recovery in a few segments continues to lag with volumes far below the pandemic levels. The right impetus will thus be key to accelerate all segments.Two, the industry is navigating a technological overhaul. The advancements, collectively known as CASE (connected, autonomous, shared and electric), will lead to cleaner powertrains, added safety, and connected and autonomous features. These consider vehicles as a shared service rather than assets for ownership.At the same time, transmission, mechanical and electronic systems are also becoming more advanced.The industry is taking the disruption head-on — electrification has gained traction this year and the share of other cleaner technologies such as hybrid and compressed natural gas has increased. However, futuristic technologies, including flex fuel, hydrogen and fuel cell, will need propulsion to translate into commercial reality. Long-term policy clarity on that front will help industry navigate through short-term bumps.Three, the structural nature of the automotive industry itself demands that it remain robust. It supports multiple sectors as part of its long value chain. Major industries such as steel, rubber, plastics, electronics, and other semi-processed and intermediary components are critical end-users. Retailing, servicing, banking, insurance, fueling, charging, logistics and personal and commercial mobility are some important forward linkages.Given this milieu, we believe the budget should focus on the following measures:It could restore the benefit of a higher deduction of 200%, as earlier. Such benefits are available to companies in many geographies, especially the ones in South Asia.The government’s focus on infrastructure should continue. It has a multiplier effect not only on employment, thereby generating income prospects, but also creates significant opportunities for EPC (engineering, procurement and construction) players/contractors, increasing demand for steel and cement and investments thereof. This will help bolster the commercial vehicles industry segment through higher sales and logistics service providers with better turnaround time on account of improved road infrastructure, thereby supporting the objective of reducing the logistics cost.The scrapping policy is a step in the right direction. But the government needs to put in place adequate incentives for owners to scrap their older vehicles. Today, owners scrapping older vehicles are unlikely to afford new ones if there is no income security. So, they would tend to purchase pre-owned vehicles rather than new ones. The current incentives are just not lucrative enough to scrap vehicles. However, the right kind will help shrink the aging on-road fleet, reduce the proportion of BSI to BS-IV vehicles and lower emissions.Two-wheelers and commercial vehicles using alternative fuels (cargo vehicles, including three-wheelers L5 category and passenger segment for mass public commute and goods movement) can be made eligible for goods and services tax (GST) rationalization. The dual GST rate for auto components, i.e., 18% and 28%, encourages grey market distribution in the aftermarket space. This is a safety hazard on the one hand and an incentive to the informal economy and loss to GST revenue on the other. Hence, it would make sense to have one GST rate for all auto components at 18%.FAME-2 was extended for two years but ended in March 2024; the Electric Mobility Promotion Scheme (EMPS) ends in July. The government will need to announce longer-term policy support for the electric vehicles (EV) industry in the budget. The consistency in its structure and fewer frequent changes by the government would reduce confusion, thereby enabling increased private sector capex. Inclusion of private players for charging infrastructure and light, medium and heavy commercial vehicles under the policy will also help proliferate EV adoption in India. The focus should also be to remove the challenges/issues currently existing to install chargers at a community level.The automotive tyre industry caters to local demand and has the potential to become a large foreign exchange earner for India. New technologies such as run-flat tyre, smart tyres, noise reduction, puncture-proof and tyres for EVs, have been introduced in this industry as well. These advancements require companies to invest heavily in capex and R&D. Extending the PLI scheme to tyres would be a welcome step for the industry and help it become more competitive vis-à-vis China, Thailand and Vietnam in the exports market.Rupee trade with developing countries that are curtailing imports due to foreign exchange/dollar crisis and are important trade partners such as Egypt, Nigeria and Turkey will help maintain exports. Also, high trade deficit countries from which India imports, such as the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Iran and Iraq, do not manufacture automobiles. Free trade agreements with these countries would also help boost automobile exports.The introduction of Section 80EEB in the Income Tax Act in 2019 allowed a deduction of up to Rs 1.5 lakh per annum on interest paid for EV loans. This was a significant step, but the benefit was not extended beyond March 2023. Re-introducing the same and raising the deduction to Rs 2 lakh a year will encourage EV adoption.Any further enhancement in deductions under section 80 will help improve/increase disposable incomes in the hands of people, improving buying power and supporting sales of discretionary items, including automobiles.Taking these actionable steps in the budget can go a long way in boosting India’s automotive industry.","India’s robust automotive industry is accelerating through a landscape transitioning in terms of demand, policy and technology.

Brokerages such as Nomura anticipate a clear message of policy continuity and a robust commitment to fiscal consolidation.Nomura analysts Sonal Varma and Aurodeep Nandi predict that the government will lower its fiscal deficit target for FY25 from 5.1% to 5% of GDP. This adjustment would signal the government’s determination to maintain fiscal stability, even in the face of a weakened political mandate. The emphasis on fiscal discipline is expected to be a cornerstone of this year’s Budget, according to an ET report quoting Nomura.To stimulate consumer demand, the government may consider increasing the standard deduction limit for taxpayers under the new tax regime, which offers lower rates without exemptions. There could also be a rise in the exemption threshold for income derived from bank interest. Furthermore, a reduction in personal income tax rates for individuals earning between Rs 5 lakh and Rs 15 lakh is on the table, Nomura said, quoting reports.Also Read | Budget 2024 income tax expectations: Why new tax regime is likely to be made more attractive The Budget is likely to prioritize the rural sector by boosting allocations for various schemes. This includes an increase in subsidies for housing, estimated at Rs 23,000 crore (approximately 0.07% of GDP), along with enhanced funding for rural roads and employment initiatives. Additionally, the government might expand the public health insurance program and rejuvenate the Lakhpati Didi economic empowerment initiative for women.Nomura anticipates that the government will reaffirm its commitment to domestic manufacturing. Potential measures include raising the minimum local content requirement for public procurement, reinstating the 15% concessional corporate tax rate for new manufacturing facilities, and revising the 2019 policy on integrating the electronics global value chain. The Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme is also expected to be extended to electronic components.Also Read | Budget 2024 expectations: Ramp up private participation in airports & railways, says expert Public capital expenditure (capex) is poised to remain a fundamental aspect of the government’s economic strategy. Nomura forecasts an increase in the total capex outlay to 3.5% of GDP, up from 3.4% in the interim Budget. In response to state demands, the government might also enhance the unconditional transfers under the 50-year interest-free loan scheme for infrastructure projects.This Budget marks the first significant financial roadmap following the recent elections, making it a critical opportunity for the government to lay out its medium-term economic vision.

Budget 2024 expectations : India has shown remarkable progress in the field of health and nutrition. Presently, over 50 crore Indians benefit from the Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB-PMJAY), ensuring their access to healthcare. The country has established 1.73 lakh Ayushman Aarogya Mandirs (AAMs) to offer comprehensive primary healthcare services.Over the past decade, the number of medical education seats for both under- and post-graduate programmes has more than doubled. Moreover, the out-of-pocket health expenditure has decreased from 63% in 2014 to 39% in 2024.Nevertheless, India still has a considerable distance to cover in comparison to global standards as it aims for Viksit Bharat @ 2047. The current life expectancy in India stands at 71 years, whereas it is 77 in China, 84 in Japan, and 75 in Brazil. India's Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) is 28 per 1000 live births, contrasting with 5 in China and less than 2 in Japan. South Africa's out-of-pocket health expenditure accounts for only about 8% of the total, in contrast to India's 39%.Presently, there are 10 doctors and 17 nurses and midwives per 10,000 individuals in India. In comparison, middle-income countries like China and Brazil have 17 doctors and 40 nurses and midwives per 10,000 persons, while high-income countries like the US and Australia have 39 doctors and 120 nurses and midwives per 10,000 individuals.Also Read | Budget 2024: Top 3 steps Modi government should consider for employment generation Countries such as Singapore, Taiwan, and South Korea have demonstrated the potential of harnessing the demographic dividend to achieve remarkable economic growth through the implementation of progressive policies and initiatives aimed at empowering the youth in making informed health choices. The allocation of adequate funds for the health sector in the Union Budget 2024-25 is of utmost importance. According to theNational Health Policy (NHP) 2017, India's healthcare expenditure should reach 2.5% of GDP by 2024-25.Notably, public healthcare spending in India encompasses health, family welfare, AYUSH, medical research, and water supply and sanitation. While some states have exceeded the 8% target outlined in the NHP 2017, others fall short, highlighting disparities in healthcare expenditure across states. Therefore, the central government plays a crucial role in augmenting state health expenditure to promote greater equity nationwide. Increased funding for nutrition, clean drinking water, and sanitation is also critical. The Budget 2024-25 should prioritize efforts to eradicate childhood undernutrition and anaemia among women and children.It is vital to increase investment in the health of children and adolescents, with a particular focus on early childhood development, care, and education for children aged 0–6 years. The first 1000 days of life, from a woman’s pregnancy to her child’s second birthday, present a unique opportunity to establish the foundation for lifelong health and development. Adequate nutrition and care during this period not only impact a child’s survival but also her ability to thrive, learn, and break the cycle of poverty. Strengthening the existing 14 lakh Anganwadi Centers and providing adequate training to staff in child development and learning, could have a significant impact.Also Read | Budget 2024: 7 structural reforms FM Nirmala Sitharaman should target for sustainable growth One crucial aspect to consider is the health of students in schools. The school-age phase is a key time for the body to start storing nutrients, which aids in rapid growth. Focusing on school children is essential for India to harness the potential of its young population, who will play a vital role in the future workforce and contribute to improving the nation's socio-economic status.Introducing a nationwide school health initiative can ensure the overall well-being of 255 million school children and teenagers aged 6-18, with a focus on physical and mental health, nutrition, wellness, and promoting a healthy lifestyle. Creating a school environment that encourages health and nutrition through activities such as yoga, physical education, mental health support, counselling, and regular health check-ups should be a top priority.The healthcare system's foundation is rooted in primary healthcare, which is essential for achieving the desired health outcomes by 2047. The future well-being of citizens depends heavily on the efficient delivery of services through our AAMs. Therefore, the transformation of all AAMs must be completed by 2027. Since 2018, the primary healthcare platform has been established with 173,000 AAMs, along with the deployment of community health officers, infrastructure upgrades, telemedicine services, and provision of free drugs and diagnostics.However, challenges related to full operationalization, coverage, quality, and continuity persist across states. The implementation of half of the package focusing on mental health, acute care, geriatric care, oral, visual, and ENT treatments, and emergency services needs to be improved. The other half of the package, which has been implemented, faces challenges with the inconsistent availability of medications and diagnostics at some AAMs. Although screenings for hypertension and diabetes have commenced, the emphasis also needs to be on treatment, follow-ups, and other services. Furthermore, cancer screening rates need to be improved, as does the training of personnel in critical areas.Research indicates that improved health outcomes contribute to enhanced economic productivity. It is essential that Budget 2024-25 is a transformational step towards securing additional funding for healthcare, alongside enhancing the quality of health services with the existing resources.","Budget 2024 expectations : India has shown remarkable progress in the field of health and nutrition.

Budget 2024 expectations : All eyes are on Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, who will present the Union Budget 2024 , on July 23. The logistics sector is especially hopeful, given the Rs 11 lakh crore boost allocated by the Interim Budget in February, by way of three major economic railway corridor programmes, including energy, mineral and cement corridors, port connectivity corridors, and high-traffic density corridors, under the PM Gati Shakti scheme .Looking ahead, we perceive the upcoming budget presenting a unique opportunity to balance the nation’s economic growth priorities with fiscal consolidation.To sustain the growth momentum of the logistics sector, prioritising capital expenditure in key infrastructure projects, alongside financial incentives such as PLI, tax benefits and subsidies are crucial as these will help drive innovation in logistics. Further, establishing a ‘One India’ logistics ecosystem and integrating initiatives such as the National Logistics Policy and Sagarmala Project are crucial in terms of enhancing India’s ranking on the global Logistics Performance Index. To reinforce India’s potential as a manufacturing powerhouse, the budget must focus on domestic manufacturing, and on preparing the logistics sector for service integration, growth in fulfilment logistics and multi-modal transportation adoption. The government should also consider automation investments, especially in technologically advanced warehouses, which can position India as a logistics innovation leader.We anticipate a stronger push for the EV industry, in the form of tax incentives, charging infrastructure subsidies and financial support for R&D. Establishing a holistic regulatory framework for last-mile delivery and formal recognition of the gig workforce under labour laws are essential to ensure fair employment practices in today’s digital economy.The logistics industry is a crucial driver of economic efficiency, and we are hopeful for the budget to include transformative measures that will drive innovation and inclusivity in the sector. We urge the government to address the logistics sector’s unique needs by enhancing the strategic allocations towardinfrastructure development , tax reforms and other governance policies. Besides this, a renewed focus on setting up digitally advanced processes with the use of cutting-edge technologies including artificial intelligence, machine learning, IoT, and big data will streamline efficiency.We hope the government will consider the inclusion of diesel under the GST ambit as this is a critical move in enabling India to reduce its logistics costs and become more competitive in the international market. It will also help key logistics players to regulate costs by cutting down on tax outflows.As we await the release of the Interim Budget, the logistics sector is primed for transformative measures that will fuel our nation’s journey to a USD 5 trillion economy. The forthcoming budget presents a significant opportunity to reinforce our commitment to enhancing the ease of doing business with India. India’s logistics costs, as highlighted by DPIIT, are encouraging; but our gaze must look beyond mere cost considerations. A strategic allocation of resources towards infrastructure, competence and traceability is essential for sustained progress.A sustained focus on and adopting a long-term perspective towards building key physical and digital infrastructure, incentivising multimodal logistics for carbon reduction, and robust skilling initiatives for the 22 million individuals employed in the sector should be the key priorities for the upcoming budget. To boost EXIM trade and improve competitiveness, we must maintain the momentum in investments and digitalisation.

The writer is CMD, Indian Energy Exchange.

Budget 2024 expectations : As Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman prepares to present the Union Budget this month, the Modi 3.0 government aims to bolster the Indian economy with a keen focus on infrastructure. A critical component of this infrastructure is the power sector, where power exchanges can play a transformative role in enhancing efficiency, transparency, and competitive price discovery.Power exchanges are pivotal in India's power sector, offering over 25 contracts across various market segments and trading more than 120 billion units (BUs) annually. Despite this, power exchanges account for only about 7% of the country's total power generation, a stark contrast to European countries where over 50% of generation is traded through exchanges. This discrepancy underscores the significant growth potential for India's power exchanges.Recognizing the importance of a robust power market, the government’s Draft National Electricity Policy aims to increase the share of spot markets to 25% by 2030. This policy aligns with India's commitment to reducing the emission intensity of its GDP by 45% from 2005 levels and achieving net-zero emissions by 2070. To support these goals, the government plans to have 50% of installed generation capacity from non-fossil sources by 2030, necessitating around 500 GW ofrenewable energy (RE) capacity.The integration of renewable energy (RE) into India's grid can be significantly accelerated through power exchanges. Renewable sources often exhibit variability and intermittent generation, posing challenges for forecasting. Power exchanges offer solutions such as the Day Ahead Market (DAM) and Real Time Market (RTM), which provide flexible trading options to manage these fluctuations effectively.International examples illustrate how power exchanges can reduce renewable integration costs and offer efficient price signals. A Deloitte study highlights that market-based RE projects can achieve higher internal rates of return (IRR) compared to Power Purchase Agreement (PPA)-based projects. This approach addresses issues like signing delays, timely payments, and avoiding disputes.The Ministry of Power’s report on the ""Development of Electricity Market in India"" also advocates for a larger role for power exchanges, citing the inefficiencies of long-term PPAs. The report suggests models such as Contracts for Difference (CfD) and Virtual PPAs, which have been successful in countries like the UK and Germany.The future of renewable energy integration hinges on grid-level energy storage. Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) are poised to drive sector growth, offering cost-effective 24/7 renewable power. Recent tenders have shown significant tariff reductions, making BESS a promising solution for rapid decarbonization.The establishment of a Capacity Market is a key anticipated change, aimed at bridging power generation with national demand and determining optimal energy mixes. Additionally, the government's push for Green Hydrogen and Rooftop Solar projects is setting the stage for Peer-to-Peer (P2P) trading, which will revolutionize power consumption in India.Power exchanges have consistently delivered lower prices compared to other procurement methods over the past 15 years. As India advances towards energy banking solutions, energy storage, and green hydrogen, new products on power exchanges will be crucial in meeting the country's future energy demands. The Union Budget 2024 presents a pivotal opportunity to harness the potential of power exchanges, driving India towards a sustainable and efficient energy future.",Power exchanges offer over 25 contracts across various market segments and trading more than 120 billion units (BUs) annually.

"From Elon Musk to David Sacks, Silicon Valley’s Trump backers cheer JD Vance as VP pick",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/from-elon-musk-to-david-sacks-silicon-valleys-trump-backers-cheer-jd-vance-as-vp-pick/articleshow/111768711.cms,"Major Silicon Valley investors hailed Donald Trump ’s choice of Ohio senator and former venture capitalist JD Vance as his running mate, a move that puts the technology industry closer to center stage in Washington if the former president takes the White House in November. Elon Musk called the decision a “great choice” and said the lineup “resounds with victory” on X, the social platform he owns.David Sacks , an investor and Trump supporter scheduled to speak at the GOP convention on Monday night, called Vance an “American patriot” in a post.And at Founders Fund, a venture capital firm backed by billionaire Peter Thiel, partner Delian Asparouhov summed up the mood of many in his orbit, posting: “IT’S JD VANCE. WE HAVE A FORMER TECH VC IN THE WHITE HOUSE. GREATEST COUNTRY ON EARTH BABY.”The Silicon Valley tech industry has long been a liberal bastion nestled in California, a Democratic stronghold, with roots in deeply progressive San Francisco. But a Republican contingent within tech has recently become increasingly visible, with major players like Musk, Sacks and Shaun Maguire from Sequoia Capital throwing their endorsements and donations to Trump for his White House bid against President Joe Biden .Representatives for Thiel and Founders Fund didn’t provide comment on the announcement.After graduating from Yale Law School, Vance in 2016 became a principal at Mithril Capital Management, a venture firm backed by Thiel, where he served a relatively brief stint. In 2017, he joined the Steve Case-backed firm Revolution LLC in Washington, as a partner focusing on startups. In 2019, he moved back to Ohio and formed Narya Capital. Taking a page from Thiel’s book, Vance made a Lord of the Rings reference with his new firm, naming Narya after a ring worn by the wizard Gandalf in the books. Narya was backed by Thiel, alongside other big-name investors including Eric Schmidt and Marc Andreessen.Vance’s proximity to the tech industry has thrilled even former Democrats in tech. One supporter is Chamath Palihapitiya, a former donor to Hillary Clinton who appears alongside Sacks on the tech podcast All In, where the hosts refer to each other as besties. After Trump’s announcement about Vance, he tweeted, “A Bestie adjacent as the VP?!?!?! ????????????????”Crystal McKellar, founder and managing partner of Aloft VC, worked with Vance at Mithril Capital in 2012 and greeted the news enthusiastically.“He will be good for Silicon Valley because he is a good free market capitalist who believes in growth and innovation and eliminating the regulation that strangles growth,” she said in a text. “And he’ll be good for the country for all the same reasons and because he feels genuine compassion for those forgotten and left behind by progress.”Matt Murphy, a partner at Menlo Ventures, said that while he didn’t know Vance, 39, or his positions well, his pick was an encouraging sign. “I think having somebody who understands tech is great,” Murphy said. “We actually have a young candidate who seems to be tech savvy. I think it’s good for the party.”Vance has had a somewhat complicated relationship with Silicon Valley. During his successful campaign for the Senate in 2022, which was backed by Thiel, he was critical of big tech companies, saying that they wield too much power and influence over politics. He argued that his background has positioned him to take on the “big tech oligarchy.”Vance has also cheered the Biden administration’s tech-focused antitrust enforcement, especially Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan. This sets Vance apart from Chamber of Commerce-type Republicans who have consistently criticized Khan’s broad interpretation of existing antitrust law to prosecute tech companies that don’t fit the profile of historic monopolies.“I look at Lina Khan as one of the few people in the Biden administration that I think is actually doing a pretty good job,” Vance said at a conference in February.But while Vance’s criticism of large tech players may rankle some in the industry, it’s similar to sentiments expressed by smaller ones. Startups and venture capitalists have long complained that the size and power of big tech players had made it difficult for small companies to compete. VC firm Andreessen Horowitz has nicknamed the startup world “Little Tech,” and pointed out the difference in priorities between small companies and bigger firms.Vance has also taken on Wall Street in other ways, backing legislation with Elizabeth Warren to claw back pay for bank executives when their institutions fail, and railroad companies with his Trump-endorsed safety bill with Democratic Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown after the East Palestine disaster.He also bucked his party in leading support for the extension of an expired Biden program providing subsidies for broadband access for millions of people. Those bipartisan efforts had earned him plaudits from Democrats but didn’t succeed in getting bills enacted into law.","The Silicon Valley tech industry has long been a liberal bastion nestled in California, with roots in deeply progressive San Francisco.

Consumers in the United States and Europe have become more cautious due to rising living costs, while demand in China has been dampened by a property crisis and record-high youth unemployment.Meanwhile, the brand also warned that based on current trends, it would fall short of annual profit forecasts and would forgo this year's dividend to invest in growth initiatives.The British brand has been undergoing a turnaround process for some time, with several leadership changes.

US West Texas Intermediate crude stood at $82.41 a barrel, up 20 cents, or 0.2 per cent.Oil prices shrugged off the impact from the dollar, which firmed after a failed assassination bid on US presidential candidate Donald Trump.""I don't think you can ignore the uncertainty that the weekend's assassination attempt will cast across a deeply divided country in the lead-up to the election,"" said IG market analyst Tony Sycamore.In the Middle East, talks on ending the Gaza conflict between Israel and Hamas halted on Saturday after three days, though a Hamas official said the following day it had not withdrawn from discussions.However, an Israeli attack targeting the group's military leader killed 90 people on Saturday.The uncertainty around the volatile situation has kept the geopolitical premium in oil elevated.Oil markets are also broadly underpinned by supply cuts from OPEC+ with Iraq's oil ministry saying it will compensate for any overproduction since the beginning of 2024.Last week, Brent fell more than 1.7% after four weeks of gains while WTI futures slid 1.1% as a fall in China's crude imports, the world's top importer, countered robust summer consumption in the United States.""While fundamentals are still supportive, there are growing demand concerns, largely emanating from China,"" ING analysts led by Warren Patterson said in a note.China's crude oil imports fell 2.3% in the first half of this year to 11.05 million barrels a day, amid disappointing fuel demand and as independent refiners cut output due to weak profit margins.Crude throughput at Chinese refineries fell 3.7% in June from a year earlier to 14.19 million bpd, the year's lowest so far, customs data showed on Monday.China's economy slowed in the second quarter as a protracted property downturn and job insecurity weighed on domestic demand, keeping alive expectations Beijing will need to unleash more stimulus.In the United States, active oil rig count, an early indicator of future output, fell by one to 478 last week, the lowest since December 2021, energy services firm Baker Hughes said on Friday.","Brent crude futures rose 15 cents, or 0.2 per cent, to $85.18 a barrel.

China’s growth slows to 4.7% as weak retail sales drag economy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/chinas-growth-slows-to-4-7-as-weak-retail-sales-drag-economy/articleshow/111741901.cms,"Other key figures from the data:

Industrial production increased 5.3% on year in June, versus economists’ forecast of 5%

Retail sales rose 2%, compared with a predicted growth of 3.4%

Fixed-asset investment gained 3.9% in the first six months, matching an expected 3.9% increase. Contraction in the property sector continued, with investment slumping 10.1% in the period

The urban jobless rate was unchanged at 5% last month from May

China’s economic growth fell to the worst pace in five quarters as retail sales slowed, piling pressure on Beijing to boost confidence at a twice-a-decade policy meeting unfolding this week.Gross domestic product expanded 4.7% in the second quarter from the same period a year earlier, data released by the National Bureau of Statistics showed Monday.That missed the median estimate of 5.1% in a Bloomberg survey of economists. Growth in the first half was 5%, in line with Beijing’s annual target of around 5%.The slowdown reflected in the data — the first set of quarterly indicators free of distortions by the pandemic — could strengthen calls for Beijing to ramp up efforts to stimulate growth. They were published the same day President Xi Jinping was set to convene the third plenum meeting to set major economic and political policies for the coming years.China needs to “fully estimate difficulties, challenges and uncertainties in development” while strengthening confidence in the economy going forward, and implement macroeconomic policies well to promote a healthy growth, the NBS said in a statement accompanying the release.Retail sales rose at the slowest pace since 2022, underscoring consumers’ reluctance to spend despite a government program to subsidize and encourage the replacement of old vehicles and home appliances.“Amongst all monthly figures released today, the highlight is weak retail sales,” said Raymond Yeung, chief economist for greater China at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group. “Household consumption remains very weak. The ‘replacement’ schemes fail to lift spending. With employers slashing salary and high youth unemployment, households will still be cautious going forward.”Chinese stocks in Hong Kong extended their losses after the disappointing data, with the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index down as much as 1.2%.The disappointing data will likely draw more attention to the Third Plenum gathering, where Xi and other top officials are expected to discuss their long-term vision for the world’s second-largest economy.In a sign of the conclave’s importance, the Chinese government skipped a monthly press conference to answer questions on the economic data, opting to only post the figures online. Beijing last disrupted the usual format of a major data release in October 2022, when Xi held a party congress that saw him securing a precedent-defying third term as leader.Economists have called on Chinese authorities to address the property downturn, boost technology self-sufficiency and relieve local fiscal strains during the four-day gathering. The party’s most senior 24 officials including Xi are set to sit down later this month for a Politburo meeting to discuss specific economic measures.China’s efforts to restart its growth engine have so far focused on the supply side, despite domestic demand remaining stubbornly weak as a years-long real estate slump continues to hurt confidence and suppress consumption.The property crisis is expected to remain the biggest overhang for the economy in the coming months, if not years. Exports — a key growth engine this year — also faces uncertainty as Beijing’s trade partners erect new barriers against Chinese goods.The room for the People’s Bank of China to cut rates is limited due to concern of capital flight, pressure on bank profits and a need to defend the yuan. Government spending this year has again lagged the budget as Beijing seeks to reduce local debt risks and officials struggle to find qualified projects to invest in.","Industrial production increased 5.3% on year in June, versus economists’ forecast of 5%.Retail sales rose 2%, compared with a predicted growth of 3.4%.Fixed-asset investment gained 3.9% in the first six months.

"US inflation broadly cools, likely sealing deal for fed rate cut",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-inflation-broadly-cools-likely-sealing-deal-for-fed-rate-cut/articleshow/111667320.cms,"US inflation cooled broadly in June to the slowest pace since 2021 on the back of a long-awaited slowdown in housing costs , sending the strongest signal yet that the Federal Reserve can cut interest rates soon.The so-called core consumer price index — which excludes food and energy costs — climbed 0.1% from May, the smallest advance in three years, Bureau of Labor Statistics figures showed Thursday.The overall measure fell for the first time since the onset of the pandemic, dragged down by cheaper gasoline.Similar to the May CPI report — which Fed Chair Jerome Powell described this week as “really good” following an unexpected flare-up in the first quarter — the June reading will go a long way toward giving Powell and his colleagues the confidence they need to cut rates, likely starting in September. Policymakers will have a chance to signal such a move may be coming when they meet later in July, especially since unemployment has now risen for three straight months.Powell, in testimony before lawmakers this week, avoided signaling the timing of likely rate cuts and insisted policy moves would be guided by incoming data. The Fed chief is set to speak again Monday afternoon in a moderated discussion hosted by the Economic Club of Washington, DC.“We are sufficiently confident — even if the Fed is not yet ready to admit they are — that inflation is on the way back to the 2% target,” Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM US LLP, said in a note. “The road is now open to a rate cut by the Federal Reserve in September.”After the CPI report, Treasuries rallied and traders all but fully priced in September and December rate cuts. They also marked up the odds of a reduction in November to better than even — a move that would come right after the presidential election. Before Thursday, traders and policymakers were divided as to whether there would be just one or two cuts this year.The report also offered encouraging news for President Joe Biden as he prepares for a high-stakes press conference later Thursday amid calls from fellow Democrats for him to step aside as the party’s nominee. The embattled president cheered the data in a statement, saying it shows “significant progress” in the fight against inflation.Metric Actual EstimateCPI MoM -0.1% +0.1%Core CPI MoM +0.1% +0.2%CPI YoY +3.0% +3.1%Core CPI YoY +3.3% +3.4%Shelter prices, which is the largest category within services, climbed 0.2%, the smallest gain since August 2021. Owners’ equivalent rent — a subset of shelter, which is the biggest individual component of the CPI — climbed 0.3%, also the tamest in three years.“Probably the most significant aspect of the June report is the downshift in housing inflation,” said Julia Coronado, the founder of MacroPolicy Perspectives LLC and former Fed economist. “It looks broad-based and durable, and numerous Fed officials have indicated a downshift would boost their confidence that inflation is indeed returning to 2% in a sustainable way.”In addition to slower rent increases, the costs of other services like airfares, hotel stays and inpatient hospital care all declined from a month earlier. New and used vehicle prices led broader decreases in the core goods basket.The BLS noted that the new vehicles index was estimated with fewer prices than in previous months due to a cyberattack that hit thousands of dealerships in June, but software systems have since been restored. “BLS has no further information on when typical data flows will resume and is monitoring the situation closely,” according to the report.Separate figures Thursday showed recurring applications for jobless benefits held near the highest level since late 2021. At the same time, first-time filings fell by 17,000 last week — matching the largest drop in a year — providing some optimism that the job market is holding up.This is a modal window.The media could not be loaded, either because the server or network failed or because the format is not supported.Excluding housing and energy, services prices fell for a second month, according to Bloomberg calculations. While central bankers have stressed the importance of looking at such a metric when assessing the nation’s inflation trajectory, they compute it based on a separate index.That measure, known as the personal consumption expenditures price index, doesn’t put as much weight on shelter as the CPI does. That helps explain why the PCE gauge has been trending closer to the Fed’s 2% target.The PCE measure, released later this month, draws from the CPI as well as certain categories within the producer price index, which is due Friday.The latest results from Delta Air Lines Inc. suggest more scope for services inflation to cool. The carrier’s revenue projections came in weaker than forecast as competition in the domestic market drives ticket prices lower.Meanwhile, a sustained decline in the price of goods over most of the past year has largely been providing some relief to consumers. So-called core goods prices, which exclude food and energy commodities, fell in June for a fourth month.Prices of new vehicles declined for a sixth month, and several apparel categories dropped as well. The cost of household furnishings has fallen nearly every month for the past year.There are also signs that consumers are growing increasingly sensitive to higher prices. Earlier on Thursday, PepsiCo Inc. reported weaker-than-expected revenue growth as budget-focused shoppers weighed on the volume of goods sold. The salty snacks category has been particularly lackluster.A separate report Thursday, combining the inflation data with figures on wages published last week, showed real earnings growth has been positive for the past year.","US inflation cooled broadly in June to the slowest pace since 2021.

How Xi Jinping can surprise world with big-bang moves,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/how-xi-jinping-can-surprise-world-with-big-bang-moves/articleshow/111651557.cms,"China has the firepower to end its housing crisis at a high-stakes policy meeting, including with a “big-bang solution” that involves pumping money like the Federal Reserve. But it’s unlikely to pull the trigger.That’s according to Bloomberg Economics, which said if the People’s Bank of China printed money on a scale similar to the Fed during the global financial crisis, it could finance the purchase of about 70% of the unsold property stock.“That’s a big-bang solution that would result in significant collateral damage — we don’t think Beijing would go that far,” economists David Qu and Chang Shu said. “Still, it shows the potential for policy solutions.”The Third Plenum, set for July 15-18, is one of the most important political meetings of the Chinese Communist Party . It’s expected to unveil a series of economic reforms and policies aimed at addressing long-standing issues that have impeded growth and recovery. Property polices are a key area of focus, as the real estate downturn remains the biggest threat to the economy.The PBOC in May announced a $41 billion program to help state-owned firms buy unsold housing stock. “That’s a promising approach, but so far insufficient to address the scale of the problem,” the Bloomberg economists wrote in a note. This would pay for less than 1% of unsold housing inventory, they said.Bloomberg Economics looked at three scenarios for how much money the PBOC could print to help local governments buy up unsold houses.If the PBOC expanded its balance sheet by about 24 trillion yuan ($3.3 trillion yuan) — similar to what the Fed did from 2008 to 2014 — it would pay for around 70% of the unsold housing stock in China.An expansion of 13 trillion yuan — similar to the European Central Bank from 2009 to 2012 after the European debt crisis — would finance the purchase of about 40% of the inventory.The flip side is that quantitative easing of this scale would come at the cost of rapidly rising debt, pressure on the yuan to fall, faster inflation and much heavier debt loads for state-owned firms and local governments, Bloomberg Economics said.The most likely option would resemble China’s “shanty-town redevelopment” program from 2015 to 2018, which tore down older homes nationwide and replaced them with new apartments. A repeat of this program, with the central bank providing 3.6 trillion yuan to banks, would finance the purchase of 10% of the stock of unsold homes.It could also provide low-cost homes for 1.6% of China’s population, Bloomberg Economics said. This would raise growth by 0.2 percentage points this year and a full percentage point in both 2025 and 2026, they estimate, as banks make more loans and confidence would increase due to the support.“Of course, quantitative easing is not a free lunch,” the economists wrote. “Adding to yuan depreciation pressure, renewing moral hazard and zeroing out future policy space are among the costs.”","China has the firepower to end its housing crisis, including with a “big-bang solution” that involves pumping money like the Federal Reserve.

A rally in the world’s largest technology companies sent stocks to all-time highs, with Jerome Powell ’s remarks to Congress not doing much to dissuade traders from betting on Federal Reserve rate cuts this year.For the first time in its history, the S&P 500 topped 5,600. A renewed bid for megacaps drove the US equity benchmark to its longest rally since November, with Nvidia Corp.up over 2.5% and Apple Inc. climbing on news it aims to ship 10% more new iPhones after a bumpy 2023. Treasuries remained fairly stable after a strong $39 billion sale of 10-year bonds. Swaps are pricing in two Fed cuts in 2024 — and higher chances the first comes in September.As Wall Street geared up for the consumer-price index, Powell said the Fed doesn’t need inflation below 2% before cutting rates, while adding officials still have more work to do. He noted the labor market has cooled “pretty significantly.” Powell cited a “good ways to go” on the balance-sheet runoff, and said commercial real estate doesn’t threaten financial stability.“The key takeaway from his testimony is the Fed’s assessment of the balance of risks is shifting in ways that – if supported and sustained by incoming data – will deliver a rate cut in September,” said Krishna Guha at Evercore.The S&P 500 climbed 1% — up for a seventh straight day — to notch its 37th record this year.

That would mark the smallest back-to-back gains since August — a pace more palatable for Fed officials.“June’s CPI report looks to be another ‘very good’ report that should boost the FOMC’s confidence about the inflation trajectory,” said Anna Wong at Bloomberg Economics. “That should set the stage for the Fed to start cutting rates in September.”A survey conducted by 22V Research shows 55% of investors expect the market reaction Thursday’s CPI to be “risk-on,” 16% said “risk-off” and 29% “mixed/negligible.”“There is optimism about inflation generally,” said Dennis DeBusschere at 22V, adding that the survey also showed investors think “CPI is on a Fed-friendly glide path.”Meantime, some trading desks say investors should gear up for a potential break in the eerie calm that’s recently descended on the market.The options market is betting the S&P 500 Index will move 0.8% in either direction after Thursday’s report on consumer prices, based on the price of that day’s at-the-money straddles, according to Stuart Kaiser, Citigroup’s head of US equity trading strategy.If it happens, that would be the biggest move for the index since June 12, the day of the last CPI print and interest-rate decision.Market volatility may pick up in the days and weeks ahead, amid US political uncertainty, comments from the Fed chair, and the start of the second-quarter earnings season, according to Mark Haefele at UBS Global Wealth Management.Source: Citi Global MarketsFor the first time since 2022, S&P 500 earnings may not be laser-focused on just technology, with the quarter’s success hanging on everything aside from the megacap tech heavyweights that have driven stocks to all-time highs, according to Bloomberg Intelligence strategists led by Gina Martin Adams.“While forecasts for the ‘Magnificent Seven’ remain robust, their earnings are expected to slow in the second quarter — just as the rest of the S&P 500 may finally post their first year-on-year growth in at least five quarters,” they noted.The Magnificent Seven may have already peaked, while the remaining S&P 500 stocks may post their first earnings expansion in at least six quarters, the strategists concluded.","S&P 500 Sees Longest Winning Streak Since November.
