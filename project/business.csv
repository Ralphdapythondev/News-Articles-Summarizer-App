"Stock market crash today: BSE Sensex ends 733 points down; Nifty50 goes below 22,500",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/stock-market-today-bse-sensex-nifty50-may-3-2024-dalal-street-indian-equities-global-markets/articleshow/109801756.cms,"Why BSE Sensex, Nifty50 crashed today

Here are the key reasons that led to today's bloodbath:

Stock market crash today: BSE Sensex and Nifty50 , the Indian equity benchmark indices, tanked in trade on Friday, despite a strong opening and the Nifty reaching a new all-time high. Selling pressure from index heavyweights Reliance Industries (RIL) and HDFC Bank led to the crash on Dalal Street . The S&P BSE Sensex dropped by 1,126 points or 1.5% to reach a low of 73,627.99, and the broader Nifty 50 fell by 289 points to touch a low of 22,358.65.All sectoral indices experienced declines in trading.BSE Sensex closed the day at 73,878.15, down 733 points or 0.98%. Nifty50 ended the day at 22,475.85, down 172 points or 0.76%. The market capitalization of companies listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange also decreased significantly by Rs 4.25 lakh crore when Sensex tanked 1,100 points.The fear gauge India VIX also increased by 11% to nearly 15, marking its 7th consecutive rise.""I feel geopolitical tension would make headlines again giving traders an option to go short on markets. Overall, the Q4 earnings are ranging from neutral to positive and are not particularly impressive. There are some reports indicating that Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) have decreased their holdings in large-cap stocks such as HDFC Bank and ITC. In the short term, the trend remains cautious, with the focus shifting towards new geopolitical developments. Hence, we advise traders to remain light on positions,"" said Prashanth Tapse of Mehta Equities.1. RIL and HDFC Banks led the market downfall. The Indian markets lost their morning gains and dropped to the day's low due to the decline in RIL, L&T, HDFC Bank, and Bharti Airtel, among others. These stocks had the most significant impact on the headline indices in terms of their contribution to the respective indices.2. India VIX, which is a measure of volatility, increased by more than 12% to 15.12 due to various factors affecting market sentiments such as Q4 earnings, the ongoing election season, and the delay in the US Fed's interest rate cut.Commenting on the day's action, Amit Goel, Co-Founder & Chief Global Strategist, Pace 360 said that the volatility of the Indian stock market has increased in the last few weeks owing to a combination of both global and domestic factors.""Globally, speculation surrounding the timing and magnitude of the season's first Fed rate cut, along with selling pressure from FIIs in emerging markets, plays a pivotal role. The NFP data from the US expected later today is also a factor in today's volatility,"" Goel added.3. In its policy for May, the Federal Reserve recognized that there has been limited advancement towards achieving its inflation target and emphasized the uncertainty surrounding the inflation trajectory. Markets expect US interest rates to stay higher for longer and are pricing in just one rate cut in 2024, said Rajani Sinha, Chief Economist, CareEdge Ratings. The non-farm payroll data from the United States that is anticipated later today is also contributing to the volatility seen today.4. Higher-for-longer interest rates. The inflation trajectory in the US has delayed the timing and magnitude of the season's first Fed rate cut. Investors are now starting to question if the Fed will be able to implement any rate cuts at all in the year 2024 due to the recent disappointing progress in reducing inflation.5. Market speculations related to the outcome of the Lok Sabha election results are also causing increased volatility. Analysts predict that volatility may increase even more as we approach the election results date of 4th June.","BSE Sensex and Nifty50 tanked in trade on Friday.

When will gold prices hit Rs 2 lakh mark? Here’s what experts say,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/investing/when-will-gold-prices-hit-rs-2-lakh-mark-heres-what-experts-say/articleshow/109750709.cms,"Gold Prices Outlook:

Gold prices: What should investors do?

Gold has been a cherished asset for Indian households, consistently delivering impressive returns compared to other investment options. Even as gold prices touch new highs this year, one wonders when the yellow metal will hit levels of Rs 1 lakh, or even Rs 2 lakh? What does historical data on the movement of gold suggest and what should investors do?Gold prices have nearly tripled over the past 9 years, rising from Rs 24,740 in 2015.This follows a similar pattern observed in the previous 9-year period, when the price tripled from Rs 8,250 in 2006. Going back further, it took approximately 19 years for the gold price to triple from Rs 2,570 per 10 g in 1987, preceded by tripling cycles of around 8 years and 6 years, states an ET report by Naveen Kumar.If the price continues to triple from its current level, gold could surpass the Rs 2 lakh per 10 gram mark. However, investors are keen to know how long it will take for the price to reach this milestone. Here is what experts have to say on future returns and timeline for gold to hit the Rs 2 lakh level:Gold prices are sensitive to global events, such as geopolitical tensions and economic crises, which can cause rapid increases in relatively short periods. In the past 5 years, factors like rupee weakness, geopolitical issues, the pandemic, and war have contributed to a 75% increase in gold prices, from Rs 40,000 to over Rs 7,00,000, in just 3.3 years. In contrast, from 2014 to 2018, gold prices only increased by 12%, from Rs 28,000 to Rs 31,250.Also Read | Important updates for NPS subscribers: New charges and security measures announced by PFRDA Jateen Trivedi, VP Research Analyst at LKP Securities, states, ""Historical data shows that major global changes, such as geopolitical tensions and economic crises, can significantly influence gold prices, leading to rapid increases within relatively short periods. The recent past of 5 years has shown rupee weakness as well as geopolitical issues and pandemic and war. All these together have given gold a spurt from Rs 40,000 to Rs 7,00,00+ — a gain of 75% in a matter of 3.3 years. In 2014, gold price was Rs 28,000 and in 2018 it was Rs 31,250, which is only 12% in a matter of 5 years.""Trivedi also suggests that gold prices could potentially reach Rs 2 lakh within the next 7-12 years, given recent trends.Some experts, like Surendra Mehta, National Secretary of the India Bullion and Jewellers Association, are even more optimistic about gold prices tripling and crossing Rs 2 lakh. Mehta believes that escalating geopolitical tensions between Iran and Israel after Ramzan, as well as China-Taiwan tensions, could bring uncertainty and lead to de-dollarisation. He predicts that these factors, along with heavy paper trading of gold in SGE and Comex, could cause gold prices to triple within the next 6 years.However, it's important to note that the tripling period for gold prices can vary significantly. Vikram Dhawan, Fund Manager and Head - Commodities at Nippon India Mutual Fund, points out that there has been an instance where the tripling period extended to almost 19 years. Dhawan reminds us that gold, like any other asset, is subject to bull and bear markets, leading to variable annual returns.He states, ""Like any other asset, gold is subject to bull and bear markets, leading to variable annual returns. However, as long as there is no better alternative, gold will continue to be in great demand from consumers and investors alike, hopefully rising to meet their return expectations.""Also Read | New mutual fund KYC rules: Is your KYC validated, verified, registered or on hold? Find out Gold is widely regarded as one of the most effective hedges against inflation. According to Harsh Gahlaut, Co-founder and CEO of FinEdge, ""Gold price is directly correlated to inflation. Inflation has been high across geographies and will take time to cool off. As long as inflation remains high, gold prices will continue to get support and see an upward trend in the future.""The trajectory of inflation will also play a crucial role in determining the pace at which gold prices increase. Hareesh V, Head of Commodities at Geojit Financial Services, explains, ""Inflation and gold prices often have a complex relationship. Gold is often seen as a hedge against inflation because its value tends to hold relatively steady or even increase during times of inflation.""In addition to inflation, various other factors also contribute to the fluctuations in gold prices. Dhawan elaborates, ""When inflation rates rise, the purchasing power of fiat currencies decreases, leading investors to turn to gold as a store of value, thus driving up its price. This relationship is complex and not always direct, as other economic factors can also impact gold prices during periods of high inflation.""The availability of gold has remained consistent, and any sudden increase in demand has the potential to drive prices higher in the short term. ""The total supply of gold is limited, which is the one reason the metal is considered a valuable asset. The supply of gold comes from two main sources — mining and recycling. The amount of new gold mined each year is relatively stable. The rest of the demand is usually met by recycling scrap gold,"" says Hareesh.The growing demand from central banks is expected to persist and may contribute to rising prices. ""There has been large-scale buying from some large central banks as they are considerably increasing their gold holdings — like Russia, China, India, etc. Since the supply of gold is limited, this increase in sovereign treasury holdings will continue to put pressure on supply and will support gold prices. We do not see the supply-side pressure easing in the near future as the risk of geopolitical conflicts does not seem to be easing,"" says Gahlaut.Also Read | Using a credit card? From usage beyond limit to overlimit fees - top queries answered based on RBI’s new FAQs While jewellery has traditionally been a significant driver of demand, it may not continue to play the same role in the future. However, the demand for bullion is anticipated to increase. ""I can see that in a country like India, gold is converting its orbit from consumption item to investment item at a much faster pace. So, sale of jewellery will keep dropping with improved sale of bullion due to financialisation of gold,"" says Mehta.The shifting dynamics of the global landscape may have a lasting effect on the trajectory of gold prices. Dhawan suggests, ""A decline in the credit rating of the US, whether actual or perceived, may propel gold into a multi-decade bull run. Re-globalisation leading to competitive currency devaluations, along with trade disputes, is conducive for gold prices. On the positive side, bigger and wealthier emerging economies that have a cultural affinity towards gold, like India, may lead to a material increase in gold consumption, underpinning the prices.""If the present situations persist or intensify, gold prices are expected to surge even higher. Gahlaut states, ""Any escalation of regional or global conflicts, outright wars breaking out, and dollar domination coming under pressure as a global currency can lead to a spike in gold prices. While returns from gold are not linear, gold will continue to play an important role as a risk reduction tool and as a hedge against inflation.""The implementation of ESG regulations could potentially cause a significant decrease in the supply of gold. Dhawan explains, ""The strict adoption of environmental, social & governance (ESG) rules worldwide is a threat to gold production. This is because gold mines are among the most expensive and most toxic places.""When considering whether to link your investment strategy to the rapid tripling of gold prices, it's essential to approach the decision with caution. ""In conclusion, the trajectory of gold prices will be shaped by a combination of economic indicators, geopolitical events, and market sentiment. While predicting exact price movements is challenging, the fundamental role of gold as a safe-haven asset suggests continued potential for growth in the future,"" says Trivedi.Incorporating gold into your investment portfolio can be a wise choice for diversification purposes. ""Diversifying investments and considering different assets, including gold, can help mitigate risks associated with inflation. During deflationary phases, gold tends to perform well compared to most asset classes,"" says Dhawan.Also Read | Mutual Fund KYC issues: What problems are MF investors facing with new rules and how they can check their KYC status However, it's crucial not to base your entire gold investment strategy solely on the expectation of its tripling potential. ""While it is impossible to predict how long gold will take to triple from the current level, it is important to note that as an asset class, gold plays a critical role as a hedge against inflation, volatility, geopolitical and currency risks and, therefore, will remain an important part of asset allocation in a person's portfolio,"" says Gahlaut.Investing in gold can be beneficial at any time when you are aiming to diversify your investment portfolio. Nevertheless, as the price of gold continues to rise, there may be opportunities to purchase gold during dips in the market. ""Higher prices may eventually lead to reactions from the supply side. However, as gold is under-owned and global gold ETF holdings are at a five-year low, pullbacks may bring in dip buying from investors. Moreover, central banks continue to be net buyers,"" says Dhawan.","Gold prices have nearly tripled over the past 9 years, rising from Rs 24,740 in 2015. If the price continues to triple from its current level, gold could surpass the Rs 2 lakh per 10 gram mark.

Instead, it is a formal request for the entities to provide an explanation as to why legal action, including financial penalties, should not be taken against them based on the findings of the investigation.Adani Ports and SEZ, in its disclosures, stated, ""The allegations are that the company has not obtained the requisite approvals, and have not made the required disclosure in the financial statements/ annual report.

We don't see much point in importing cars here. We want to continue our strategy to make cars in India, and our priority is not to import electric cars,"" Koskas said. The EV policy promises subsidised customs duty of 15% for companies to import their green models here, but only when they commit to invest a minimum of $500 million for a factory, apart from substantial local value addition.Citroen, that has followed group company Jeep into India, also said it sees India as a big opportunity for growth , though stiff competition from rivals and demanding customers are challenges ahead.""If you succeed in India, you can succeed anywhere in the world. It is one of the most competitive markets in the world. Cars here are most competitive and expectations of customers is among the highest.

This is his third visit to the country over last 12-13 months.

The company will launch fifth product Basalt coupe later this year. Koskas said that to succeed in India, companies will need to constantly launch new cars and variants to excite the market.""One key learning is that you need to bring in novelty, constantly. Indian customers are really moving quickly from one thing to another. If you don't get new features and new cars, you will not be able to sustain...

Stellantis is present in India through Jeep and Citroen, and is now planning to go on an overdrive when it comes to expanding operations, introducing brands, widening retail, or making new investments.The global partnership between Stellantis and Leapmotor is also a recent one, and it is this deal that perhaps gives confidence to the Chinese company to make a bid for the Indian market, despite strict checks on investments from companies that emanate from countries, which share land border with India.These checks have seen BYD struggle to expand in India after failing to get approvals from govt on its investment plans, despite making a bid with a local partner. On the other hand, MG Motor, owned by China's SAIC group, had to finally give space to an Indian partner as Sajjan Jindal's JSW bought a significant stake in the company with agreements to take it up to 51% over the next few years.Stellantis had announced plans to invest $1.6 billion in Leapmotor to acquire approximately 20% in Oct last year, emerging as a significant shareholder in the Chinese budget EV company.

The finance minister set the stage for a ""Viksit Bharat by 2047"", on the core principles of ‘Sabka Saath’, ‘Sabka Vikas’, ‘Sabka Vishwas’, with ‘Sabka Prayas’ being added as a new theme in the interim Budget.This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data i.e., farmer welfare and N for Nari utthan i.e., support for women entrepreneurs.These form the pillars of a comprehensive inclusive development. The Government's commitment to sustainable development under the strategy for Amrit Kaal includes achieving 'Net Zero' by 2070, rooftop solarization for one crore households and robust health initiatives.The Indian economy's resilience takes center stage amidst positive indicators of declining current account deficit as a percentage of GDP, falling unemployment rates, and a notable rise in digital transactions. These statistics affirm the robustness of the economy, showcasing a trajectory of growth and stability.The achievements in taxation reforms are nothing short of remarkable, with direct tax collections more than trebling in the last decade, the number of tax return filers increasing by 2.4 times, average processing time of tax returns plummeting from 93 days in FY 2013-14 to an impressive 10 days in FY 2023-24, resulting in issuance of quick refunds. These are the results of consistent progressive measures thus obviating the need for, and rightly avoiding, any last-minute populist measures.No change in existing tax rates, both for direct and indirect taxes, is a good indicator of stability and predictability for investors and taxpayers.A welcome move to waive outstanding tax demands that are minor, disputed, and unreconciled. This involves the withdrawal of outstanding direct tax demands up to Rs. 25,000 pertaining to the period up to FY 2009-10 and up to Rs.10,000 for FY 2010-11 to 2014-15.The Government's commitment to fostering a business-friendly environment is evident in its intent to extend specific tax benefits for start-ups, investments by sovereign wealth funds/ pension funds, and certain IFSC units. The extension has been made now until March 31, 2025. This might help in creating a conducive landscape for business.To align with the CBDT notification issued earlier, the provisions relating to tax collection at source concerning remittances under the Liberalized Remittance Scheme have now been formally incorporated in the Finance Bill, 2024, setting the rate at 20% for amounts exceeding Rs. 7 lakhs in a financial year.The Finance Bill, 2024 proposes an extension of the time limit for introducing the faceless scheme by the Central Government for transfer pricing proceedings, DRP Proceedings, and ITAT Proceedings, up to March 31, 2025.The interim Budget 2024 may not have proposed significant tax announcements, but it very well positioned the prelude to the full budget post the upcoming elections. Considering the potential impact on the population across the four pillars of GYAN, a sizable portion of India stands to be covered. The interim Budget’s focus on the tax front resembles a report card, highlighting the maturity achieved by our tax system. The enhancement of taxpayer services was emphasized as a key priority.","This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data and N for Nari utthan.

Interim Budget for a Viksit Bharat: It’s for everyone and all,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/interim-budget-for-a-viksit-bharat-its-for-everyone-and-all/articleshow/107497439.cms,"By Akhilesh Tuteja

The Finance Minister on February 01, 2024, delivered a truly innovative interim budget. At first glance, it did not seem like an interim budget but looked more like the budget to drive further growth and a continuum of inclusive growth-oriented investments.At the outset, this budget brings a wonderful balance between fiscal prudence and continued investment for growth.It's not easy to continue the glide path of reducing the fiscal deficit and continuing to make significant investments in all areas including infrastructure, R&D, energy transition, technology, skilling, and social welfare. The surprising reduction in fiscal deficit of 5.8% as against the budgeted 5.9% for FY24 and the projection of 5.1% in FY25 with a clear focus on increasing investments was a huge positive.This was a budget for everyone and all because it caters to every part of the Indian economy and society. The FM has carefully catered to the investment needs of various sectors. The continued focus on youth, impoverished, women and farmers to increase their involvement and contribution to economic growth is evident. By committing an 11.1% increase in capital expenditure to 11,11,111 lakh crore, the FM has clearly brought every single 1 in this growth journey.What was very impressive was the inclusion strategy of the government. The focus on women's empowerment for the past few years is unprecedented, which is reflected in the inclusion of women in the workforce moving from 23.3% to 37% in the last five years. The thirty crore Mudra Yojna loans to women entrepreneurs were a great boost to the Nari Shakti initiative. We already have over 10 million Lakhpati Didis and what is truly evident is like a corporate CFO, the FM has revised the earlier target of 20 million Lakhpati Didis to 30 million. The government also plans to invest in initiatives to encourage young girls between the ages of 9 and 14 to undertake the vaccination for cervical cancer which is again a great boost to Nari Shakti.A lot needs to be done to bring more women into all parts of economic growth but the journey so far and the vision of the future is truly inspiring.While India continues on its technological prowess and makes its mark in new technologies like Artificial Intelligence, we need a multi-pronged strategy to harness the power of AI. We need a clear focus on building AI systems in India so that we not only emerge as a global leader in this new era but can build models, which are specific to India that will benefit Indians. At the same time, we need a very wide coverage program to build skills to leverage AI to its fullest potential. The biggest contribution we can make to the inclusion of youth in the economic development of the country is by skilling them in new skill areas. In the last few years, the Skill India Mission has trained 14 million youth, reskilled over 5 million youth and established a staggering 3,000 new ITIs. The future of any country will depend as much on capital investments as on skill investments.The focus on agricultural development and support to the farmer continues through direct financial assistance to farmers. The farmers have benefited by getting crop insurance through PM Fasal Bima Yojana. It's not just the farmers, the PM-SVANidhi provides credit assistance to a large number of street vendors.The last few years have seen the journey of affordable housing through Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY). There is a slight increase in allocation to launch a scheme for encouraging the middle class to build or buy new homes. This investment will likely propel a wider economic development and increase employment.India has seen a tremendous rise in entrepreneurship in the last few years. In order to continue the journey and promote new startups, the government proposes to extend certain tax benefits, which are expiring from March 2024 to March 2025. The MSMEs have not been left behind. With a proposal to provide timely finances to such enterprises, the government has paved the way for their growth, so they can look to compete globally.All in all, it’s a truly inclusive budget with a clear focus on development not just by giving away freebies but enabling the people to participate in the economic development activity. While the FM calls the comprehensive GDP - Governance, Development & Performance – to me, this budget is inclusive of another GDP – gender, demography, and professions.","Akhilesh Tuteja is Partner and Head, Clients and Markets, KPMG in India.

‘Enough domestic sources of demand to counter drag from external sector’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/enough-domestic-sources-of-demand-to-counter-drag-from-external-sector/articleshow/107372012.cms,"Do you think the

creates room for lower interest rates?

One of the issues that the Budget has flagged is the demographic challenge and opportunity and the societal change that is taking place. How do you view this?

Niti Aayog is working on the Viksit Bharat roadmap. What will be the focus areas?

You are as much a representative of the Centre as well as the states. Is it time to revisit the entire formula for transfers to states particularly on the issue of cesses and surcharges?

Suman Bery , who heads Niti Aayog , the govt think tank, is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China, which he says is also an opportunity for India. The economist is confident that Indian states remain resilient. Excerpts of the interview with TOI.The finance ministry expects the economy to grow 7% next year.Given the global situation, how do you see the prospects?The belief in the finance ministry is that we have a possible drag coming from the external sector but that we have other sources. We have enough domestic sources of demand. One has to applaud the political and economic judgment of FM in deciding that it was appropriate to pursue the path of fiscal consolidation. There is transparency. What this actually reflects is responsible economic management, which is one reason we are where we are. Second, it also creates a buffer so that there is policy space if we do encounter headwinds.That’s the hope and expectation. We have an independent central bank and an inflation targeting central bank, so it is up to the monetary policy committee to take a call through the monetary policy committee on the repo rate .The PM has said that when India grows its states grow. India is a composite of 37 states and UTs. They are each at very different points in their demographic transition. There are some states where the net replacement rate is down to 1%, like Kerala . There are others, particularly UP and Bihar, which are in their earliest stage of demographic transition and each one of these states is the size of a large European country. There are two implications of that — one is internal labour mobility and it will become an even larger part of our growth model. The govt has taken several steps to create a unified market. Our main endowment is our human capital and that has to be equipped to participate in global exchange in many ways. We know from China, Japan that the demographic dividend partly depends on markets and on human capital. But the golden period is fairly short lived, about 15 years, when the so called dependency ratio declines. The other big opportunity the PM has been highlighting is bringing women much more into the active labour force.When Niti was set up there was the idea of a three-year vision and a seven-year strategy paper. The reality is that schemes of govt tend to be aligned with the award of the Finance Commission . There are various established building blocks or hand holds which are already a matter of govt policy. The PM is much more interested in a national debate on what it means to be a Viksit Bharat or modern society. We have a collective goal and it is for the democratic polity to define what that goal should be. Its emphatically not for a super mandarin bureaucracy. It is not going to be Lee Kwan Yew’s Singapore led from the top.It’s entirely a finance ministry matter but I would be lying if I didn’t say when I visit certain states there is this complaint. A big frontier would be resource mobilisation at the state level. Second is going to be rationalisation of subsidies not only at the Union level, but also at the state level. All chief ministers sit on my governing council. When they convene as the governing council, I see them in their role as development practitioners. The world is beginning to appreciate quite how much institutional and political maturity India attained in our 75 years and the most fundamental dimension of a democracy, we have orderly transfers of power. There are enough buffers to ensure that what happens in state finances is unlikely to create macro instability. Those risks are well contained by our Constitution. The chief ministers know that they are going to be judged by development outcomes and so you can have the sugar rush of changing of pension plans or various handouts but if the cupboard is bare you are not going to be able to deliver.","Suman Bery is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China.

Government's Marathon to 2047: Emphasis on Fiscal Prudence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/governments-marathon-to-2047-emphasis-on-fiscal-prudence/articleshow/107371788.cms,"What was the thinking behind keeping the vote on account absolutely straight?

So is it the idea to keep the Budget completely transparent?

The capex has risen 11.1% and there is an emphasis on infrastructure spending. But there is also the hope that the private sector will now take over and start capital spending. Given the geopolitical situation, how confident is the govt that it will pan out as planned?

Finance secretary T V Somanathan, in an interview with TOI, says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047 . Excerpts:If you see the Budget speech you will see the emphasis on 2047. The govt has set its sight on running that marathon.Running to 2047 is a marathon , it’s not a sprint. If you are going to run a marathon, you need to be in good shape and you can’t have short-term stimulants or something that will get you some yards and then it’s done.The whole focus is on making India a developed country by 2047, for which a healthy present and a strong fiscal position is an important concomitant. Some purely short term measures don’t really fit into that picture. It’s a consistent picture: focus on the long term for which you need to build strength in the short term and that needs to be done by prudence in fiscal policy and by not doing things which can detract you from that path. Not doing the wrong thing is more important than appearing to do things.The idea is that govt finances may be good, bad or indifferent depending on the times, depending on the circumstances, depending on the policies. But what is the position should be reflected as reasonably and accurately as possible. That is an emphasis. As regards the Finance Commission, again the terms of reference that have been given to them are the terms in the Constitution.What is the means by which the devolution should be done is a matter they have full discretion. They can actually take all kinds of factors into account and in a sense we felt this time based on my review of the previous commissions that the right expression would be less is more. The shorter, less prescriptive terms of reference gives full scope for all stakeholders including state govts to express their viewpoints and for the commission to take a balanced view of the different perspectives and then come to its award. Ultimately the award of the Finance Commission is about devolution and grant for which full scope has now been given to them.n There are incipient signs of private capital expenditure accelerating. There are some surveys I have seen done by some of the chambers industry, which show high levels of investment. The PMI, which is a sort of leading indicator, is also looking pretty healthy. Capacity utilisation is one reason that private sector capital expenditure doesn’t immediately pick up when the economy starts accelerating because there is surplus capacity.But increasingly I get the sense that many industries are beginning to reach levels where they have to add capacity. When that happens capital investment will happen. Another pointer also mentioned in the Budget speech you may notice that our airlines have placed large orders for planes — that is capital expenditure.When you import 1,000 aircraft, it’s just not 1,000 aircraft, there are concomitant additions to ground handling facilities, you need airports to expand, you need to employ people to do that. That means a lot of jobs. The aircraft is capital but then look at the effect it is going to have on skilled jobs. So capital expenditure is happening. I am fairly confident that we will have decent capital expenditure in the year to come and that will become a new source of acceleration.",Finance secretary T V Somanathan says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047.

Income Tax Changes Budget 2024 : In the recent Budget 2024 speech, the Finance Minister kept the Section 80C tax deduction limit unchanged. The maximum limit for claiming tax benefits under Section 80C remains at Rs 1.5 lakh for the current fiscal year 2023-24 and will stay the same for individuals looking to save on taxes through Section 80C investments in the upcoming fiscal year 2024-25.Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions. Individuals can reduce their gross taxable income by up to Rs 1.5 lakh per financial year by engaging in these specific investments or expenditures.You can save on taxes through Section 80C by investing in things like Employees' Provident Fund (EPF), Public Provident Fund (PPF), Equity Linked Saving Scheme (ELSS) mutual funds, National Savings Certificate (NSC), and 5-year tax-saving fixed deposits with banks or post offices. Additionally, paying life insurance policy premiums also qualifies for tax benefits under Section 80C.It is important to note that each eligible investment comes with its specific maximum limit, rate of return, liquidity, and taxation rules for the earned returns, states ET in a report. For instance, the most you can invest in PPF in a financial year is Rs 1.5 lakh. Meanwhile, there's no limit on the amount you can invest in ELSS mutual funds, but the Section 80C deduction is capped at Rs 1.5 lakh.If individuals can't make specific investments, they can still get deductions under Section 80C from their gross taxable income through certain expenses. These expenses include repaying the principal amount of a home loan, tuition fees for children, payment of stamp duty, registration fees, and other costs related to buying a house.Since the financial year 2020-21, individuals without any business income must annually choose between the old and new tax regimes. As of the fiscal year 2023-24, the new tax regime is the default option. Consequently, individuals seeking tax deductions under Section 80C must opt for the old tax regime since this deduction isn't available in the new tax regime. It's crucial for taxpayers to be aware of these rules to make informed decisions about their tax planning and investment strategies.","Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget which is an interim budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year. The budget talks about inclusive development both, social and geographical, especially for youth, women, farmers, and the poor. Continued focus on improving logistics through infrastructure spend on roads, rail, airports, ports increases productivity for companies and citizens alike.To make ‘Viksit Bharat’ by 2047, the government’s focus is on improving and empowering people’s capabilities through various skilling initiatives. It is encouraging to see that Skill India Mission has succeeded in training more than 1.4 crore youth and upskilling and reskilling 54 lakh youth. I am particularly happy to see the continued focus on youth and women entrepreneurship and the announcement of a new fund which will give interest free 50 year loans for startups will provide a domestic fillip to startups supplementing venture capital we have traditionally relied on from abroad.PM Mudra Yojana has sanctioned 43 crore loans aggregating to 22.5 lakh crore to youth entrepreneurs and thirty crore Mudra Yojana loans to women entrepreneurs. There are several other schemes like Fund of Funds, Start-Up India, and Start-Up Credit Guarantee schemes that are assisting our youth. Further, the extension of tax benefits to Start-ups and investments made by sovereign wealth funds/pension funds, till 31st March 2025 depicts the government’s effort to support the startup eco- system.This aligns quite well with India Sanitation Coalition’s efforts to give impetus to the start-up world. Over the past 7 editions of our ISC-FICCI Sanitation Awards, we have recognized and promoted several start-ups in the sanitation space, many of whom are successful businesses now!While the finance minister did not provide detailed information on Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH), the budget allocation sees a slight increase in spend demonstrating continued focus on this highly successful program. The acknowledgement that the private sector has increasingly played a substantial role in addressing WASH issues in both urban and rural areas, with numerous projects underway through Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs), highlights the government's commitment to addressing challenges in this sector.A perfect example is the LightHouse Initiative initiated by the Department of Drinking Water along with the India Sanitation Coalition (ISC) by partnering with major corporates across India to develop model villages in Solid and Liquid Waste Management (SLWM) under SBM-Grameen. From this budget, there is an expectation that the government will persist in prioritizing Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) as the path toward achieving the country's Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6). Additionally, it is hoped that the government will uphold its commitment to making necessary infrastructural investments for SLWM.The budget speech rightly celebrates the fact that we have 83 lakh SHGs and 9 crore women beneficiaries. The microfinance movement in the country and the possibility of empowering women members of SHGs through livelihood skilling is a key to bringing women into mainstream economic advancement.The focus on green growth, rooftop solar, wind, biomass, e-vehicles all help with our green energy thrust. The tourism sector was mentioned and could be a huge job provider for youth and women.Guided by the principle ‘Reform, Perform, and Transform’, the budget emphasizes efficient implementation of various policies by improving coordination with states and relevant stakeholders. This is critical both for infra spend and social programsIt is noteworthy that ISC’s Climate Resilient Coastal Cities project which is being implemented in PPP (Public-Private Partnership) mode in four coastal states of Karnataka, Gujarat, Goa and Maharashtra is congruent with the government’s priority of promoting climate-resilient activities for the blue economy 2.0, a scheme for restoration and adaptation measures, and coastal aquaculture.The budget also focuses on the Aspirational districts program where assistance will be given to the states for faster development of aspirational districts and blocks, including the generation of ample economic opportunities.

During 2017-18 alone, IL&FS's losses have now been estimated at Rs 7,393 crore, compared with profit of Rs 332 crore stated earlier, a govt source told TOI.According to data shared with the ministry of corporate affairs, I-FIN's losses during the five years were pegged at close to Rs 5,000 crore against the earlier-reported cumulative profits of Rs 1,602 crore between 2013-14 and 2017-18.In the case of ITNL, the losses for the five financial years add up to Rs 1,500 crore, against profits of Rs 1,486 crore reported by the earlier management.

"Millennial, Gen Z homes spur Q-commerce growth",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/millennial-gen-z-homes-spur-q-commerce-growth/articleshow/109864886.cms,"‘Q-commerce accounts for 50% of online grocery market’

MUMBAI: Two years ago, people laughed off the concept of quick commerce or instant deliveries. Some even asserted that consumers do not need products in 10-15 minutes.Today, however, quick commerce is fast becoming ubiquitous for many millennial and Gen Z households. Companies have moved beyond groceries to deliver items ranging from fans and T-shirts to jewellery and iPhones.In a recent note, Goldman Sachs said Blinkit's implied valuation - estimated at $13 billion - is now higher than that of parent Zomato's core food delivery business, indicating the rapid growth of the segment. Though still largely a metro play, Q-commerce is finding takers in cities like Vizag, Nagpur, Kochi, Jaipur and Lucknow, executives at Swiggy Instamart and BigBasket told TOI.In the past one year, half the new customers that we have added are all pure play quick commerce customers, who often do not make planned purchases and end up buying 4-15 times a month from our platform,” said Seshu Kumar Tirumala, chief buying and merchandising officer at BigBasket.For IPO-bound Swiggy, growth of Instamart in non-metros like Jaipur and Kochi has more than doubled in the past 12 months. “Given the wide array of products, we are seeing good traction in both metros and non-metros,” said Phani Kishan, CEO, Swiggy Instamart.According to analysts, a share of grocery spends in the top 7-8 cities may be moving from local kirana stores to quick commerce.“Incremental purchases solely cannot justify the growth of quick commerce. Some parts of offline purchases and scheduled online deliveries have moved to the segment. The platforms are also getting sales from impulse purchases which will not go to kirana stores,” said Satish Meena, advisor at market research firm Datum Intelligence.With platforms like Zepto, Swiggy Instamart and Blinkit expanding into categories like beauty and personal care (BPC), toys, electronics, stationery items, a percentage of e-commerce sales is bound to get impacted. At present, non-grocery items account for about 15%-20% of quick commerce purchases.“If consumers can get a toy or a BPC item on a quick commerce platform instantly, they won’t wait for Amazon and Flipkart to deliver it to them. That is why players like Flipkart have started working on the quick commerce model,” Meena said. “Consumers have been ordering everything, from gold coins during the festive season to air purifiers, FASTags, headphones, toys and more,” said Kishan.Goldman Sachs estimates the size of the online grocery market, in terms of gross order value (GOV), to be about $11 billion as of FY24. Of this, quick commerce already makes up 50% or $5 billion. Q-commerce platforms have also been able to price products about 10%-15% cheaper than local kirana stores, giving them an edge in the game. “Given the scale of platforms such as Blinkit, they are able to get pricing/sourcing advantage from manufacturers,” said analysts at the firm.“We want to become an attractive option even when compared to the best discount grocers in the offline space. If we can give consumers access to better prices and 10-minute deliveries, why won’t they buy from Zepto?” co-founder and CEO Aadit Palicha had told TOI earlier.In terms of wallet share, quick commerce potentially accounts for 5%-6% of a household’s grocery spends.","Q-commerce is finding takers in cities like Vizag, Nagpur, Kochi, Jaipur and Lucknow.

Indian students studying in the United States, including those enrolled in prestigious Ivy League universities , are facing difficulties securing internships for the upcoming summer due to a slowdown in job growth in the country. According to individuals knowledgeable about the situation, many students have been unable to obtain internship offers, which are essential for gaining practical experience before entering the highly competitive job market The global economic slowdown has significantly impacted entry-level job opportunities, students, education consultants, and Indian-American professionals in the US have said. According to an ET report, they also claimed that the situation has been exacerbated by the tendency of many companies to hire local students during an election year.Furthermore, Indian students graduating from US universities this year are facing additional challenges, such as high inflation rates, rising living costs, local unemployment, and sponsorship issues.""There were about 400 undergrad students in the final year in the East Coast and West Coast, including in Ivy League schools, whom I counselled over the years, who have not got any internship offers this summer,"" said Adarsh Khandelwal, co-founder of the education consulting company Collegify.The Ivy League, a group of eight private universities located in the northeastern United States, including prestigious institutions such asHarvard University , Yale University, and the University of Pennsylvania, is renowned for its academic excellence and social prestige.According to Khandelwal, ""Indians, even in top US colleges such as NYU Stern, UC Berkeley, Brown University, University of Pennsylvania and University of Texas at Austin, are struggling. A lot of these kids have reached out to us seeking help to get placed in India.""Khandelwal cited an example of a 22-year-old Harvard University student in his final year, majoring in economics and psychology, who has been unsuccessful in securing a summer internship despite applying to numerous companies over the past six months.The current job market has proven challenging even for students in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields, who were highly sought after before the Covid-19 pandemic. Technology, consulting, and new-age companies are now either laying off staff or implementing hiring freezes.Khandelwal stated, ""There are hardly any jobs for vanilla coding skills, unless there is an element of AI (artificial intelligence) or emerging technology in it.""An Indian American employee at a leading consulting firm, who wished to remain anonymous, revealed, ""My firm prefers to hire Americans over Indians.""This situation persists despite American colleges continuing to attract foreign students, including those from India, with the number of Indian students pursuing higher education in the United States reaching an all-time high.","Indian students studying in the United States are facing difficulties securing internships for the upcoming summer.

She filed a case of dowry harassment against her husband and in-laws, which is pending in court. In July 2022, the wife lodged another FIR accusing him of unnatural sex.“The only question for consideration is whether a husband during the subsistence of marriage while residing together can be said to be guilty of marital rape… Section 375 exception 2 of IPC provides that sexual intercourse or sexual acts by a man with his own wife, the wife not being under 15 years of age, is not rape,” Justice Ahluwalia said.The only exception to this provision is IPC section 376(B), where the sexual act with the wife occurs when they are living separately on account of judicial separation, the court said.“When rape includes insertion of penis in the mouth, urethra or anus of a woman and if that act is committed with his wife, not below the age of 15 years, then consent of the wife becomes immaterial,” the order says.Referring to the amended definition of ‘rape’ under IPC section 375, the HC order said under the circumstances, absence of consent of wife for unnatural act loses its importance. “Marital rape has not been recognised so far,” Justice Ahluwalia said, quashing the FIR and subsequent proceedings against the petitioner.","Madhya Pradesh HC has ruled that unnatural sex with wife is not rape, and her consent is immaterial in such cases.

The 2017 Presidential polls saw a contest between the then Bihar governor Ram Nath Kovind, who emerged victorious, and former Lok Sabha speaker Meira Kumar, a native of the region.In a phone interview, Laloo Prasad Yadav expressed his determination to win the election by a comfortable margin.""I have been contesting Lok Sabha polls from Saran constituency for the last several terms. I had contested against former Bihar chief minister Rabri Devi as well.

Bose asked her on April 19 to meet him with her CV; she went to meet him on April 24 at 12.45 pm, when he ""touched her inappropriately and made untoward advances"", the complaint says. Bose again called her to his office on Thursday but the woman, instead of going alone, asked her supervisor to accompany her. The woman told cops that Bose asked the supervisor to leave after some time, following which he assured her of a promotion and then ""touched her cheek"", prompting her to protest.A video circulating since the evening shows the woman complaining to a senior cop that she had been molested. ""This is not the first time this has happened to me,"" she is heard saying on phone before explaining why she had not complained earlier: ""I had kept quiet as I was scared of losing my (contractual) job."" She felt impelled to complain on Thursday, after the latest incident , to protect others from facing the ordeal she had faced. She is also seen referring to another woman who made similar complaints in the past.""We are duty-bound to register a case and begin a probe since a woman has lodged this complaint,"" a senior police officer said. Other seniors told TOI they had recorded the woman's statement but did not register any FIR. ""Article 361 of the Indian Constitution insulates the governor from any criminal proceeding while in office,"" another senior official said, adding that legal experts would be consulted.Raj Bhavan issued a statement a couple of hours later.

But they cannot stop my fight against corruption and violence in Bengal,"" it read. Another statement thanked Raj Bhavan staff ""who expressed solidarity against derogatory narratives circulated by two disgruntled employees as political parties' agents"".Yet another release issued after 10pm banned the entry of cops and state finance minister Chandrima Bhattacharya in Raj Bhavan premises. The cop ban was to prevent their entry ""in the guise of conducting unauthorised, illegitimate, sham and motivated investigations to placate political bosses during election"", the statement said, banning minister Bhattacharya's entry in Raj Bhavan premises in Kolkata, Darjeeling and Barrackpore.

KL Sharma , a trusted aide of Sonia Gandhi, the former Congress president, served as her representative during her tenure as the member of Parliament from Rae Bareli.

Kishori Lal, a dedicated member of the Congress party, has been diligently overseeing the party's activities and operations in Amethi and Rae Bareli for a long time period. Kishori Lal has played a crucial role in maintaining the party's presence and influence in both the constituencies.

Kishori Lal Sharma, a native of Ludhiana, Punjab, was first introduced to Amethi by Rajiv Gandhi in approximately 1983.

Following Rajiv Gandhi's tragic demise in 1991, the Gandhi family stopped participating in elections from this constituency. However, Sharma remained steadfast in his support and continued to actively campaign for Congress party candidates in the area.

Kishori Lal Sharma was instrumental in Sonia Gandhi's maiden electoral triumph in Amethi in 1999. It was through this victory that Sonia secured her entry into the Parliament for the first time.

KL Sharma has also worked for the Congress party in Bihar and Punjab.

NEW DELHI: The Congress party has chosen Kishori Lal Sharma as their candidate for the Amethi Lok Sabha constituency in Uttar Pradesh, putting an end to the speculation that had been circulating for weeks regarding their candidates for both Amethi and Rae Bareli seats.Sharma will face off against BJP's Smriti Irani , who emerged victorious against Rahul Gandhi in the 2019 general elections.Meanwhile, the Congress party has decided to field Rahul Gandhi from the Rae Bareli constituency.The two seats will go to polls on May 20 in the fifth of the seven-phase general election.","Kishori Lal Sharma is a trusted aide of Sonia Gandhi, the former Congress president.

Warren Buffett says AI may be better for scammers than society. And he's seen how,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/warren-buffett-says-ai-may-be-better-for-scammers-than-society-and-hes-seen-how/articleshow/109857585.cms,"OMAHA: Warren Buffett cautioned the tens of thousands of shareholders who packed an arena for his annual meeting that artificial intelligence scams could become ""the growth industry of all time.""Doubling down on his cautionary words from last year, Buffett told the throngs he recently came face to face with the downside of AI. And it looked and sounded just like him.Someone made a fake video of Buffett, apparently convincing enough that the so-called Oracle of Omaha himself said he could imagine it tricking him into sending money overseas.The billionaire investing guru predicted scammers will seize on the technology, and may do more harm with it than society can wring good.""As someone who doesn't understand a damn thing about it, it has enormous potential for good and enormous potential for harm and I just don't know how that plays out,"" he said.EARNINGS BEFORE MUSINGSThe day started early Saturday with Berkshire Hathaway announcing a steep drop in earnings as the paper value of its investments plummeted and it pared its Apple holdings. The company reported a $12.7 billion profit, or $8,825 per Class A share, in first the quarter, down 64% from $35.5 billion, or $24,377 per A share a year ago.But Buffett encourages investors to pay more attention to the conglomerate's operating earnings from the companies it actually owns. Those jumped 39% to $11.222 billion, or $7,796.47 per Class A share, led by insurance companies' performance.None of it that got in the way of the fun.Throngs flooded the arena to buy up Squishmallows of Buffett and former Vice Chairman Charlie Munger , who died last fall. The event attracts investors from all over the world and is unlike any other company meeting. Those attending for the first time are driven by an urgency to get here while the 93-year-old Buffett is still alive.""This is one of the best events in the world to learn about investing. To learn from the gods of the industry,"" said Akshay Bhansali, who spent the better part of two days traveling from India to Omaha.A NOTABLE ABSENCEDevotees come from all over the world to vacuum up tidbits of wisdom from Buffett, who famously dubbed the meeting 'Woodstock for Capitalists.'But a key ingredient was missing this year: It was the first meeting since Munger died.The meeting opened with a video tribute highlighting some of his best known quotes, including classic lines like ""If people weren't so often wrong, we wouldn't be so rich."" The video also featured skits the investors made with Hollywood stars over the years, including a ""Desperate Housewives"" spoof where one of the women introduced Munger as her boyfriend and another in which actress Jaimie Lee Curtis swooned over him.As the video ended, the arena erupted in a prolonged standing ovation honoring Munger, whom Buffett called ""the architect of Berkshire Hathaway.""Buffett said Munger remained curious about the world up until the end of his life at 99, hosting dinner parties, meeting with people and holding regular Zoom calls.""Like his hero Ben Franklin, Charlie wanted to understand everything,"" Buffett said.For decades, Munger and Buffett functioned as a classic comedy duo, with Buffett offering lengthy setups to Munger's witty one-liners. He once referred to unproven internet companies as ""turds.""Together, the pair transformed Berkshire from a floundering textile mill into a massive conglomerate made up of a variety of interests, from insurance companies such as Geico to BNSF railroad to several major utilities and an assortment of other companies.Munger often summed up the key to Berkshire's success as ""trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very intelligent."" He and Buffett also were known for sticking to businesses they understood well.""Warren always did at least 80% of the talking. But Charlie was a great foil,"" said Stansberry Research analyst Whitney Tilson, who was looking forward to his 27th consecutive meeting.NEXT GEN LEADERSMunger's absence, however, created space for shareholders to get to know better the two executives who directly oversee Berkshire's companies: Ajit Jain, who manages the insurance units; and Abel, who handles everything else and has been named Buffett's successor. The two shared the main stage with Buffett this year.The first time Buffett kicked a question to Abel, he mistakenly said ""Charlie?"" Abel shrugged off the mistake and dove into the challenges utilities face from the increased risk of wildfires and some regulators' reluctance to let them collect a reasonable profit.Morningstar analyst Greggory Warren said he believes Abel spoke up more Saturday and let shareholders see some of the brilliance Berkshire executives talk about.Abel offered a twist on Munger's classic ""I have nothing to add"" line by often starting his answers Saturday by saying ""The only thing I would add.""""Greg's a rock star,"" said Chris Bloomstran, president of Semper Augustus Investments Group. ""The bench is deep. He won't have the same humor at the meeting. But I think we all come here to get a reminder every year to be rational.""A LOOK TO THE FUTUREBuffett has made clear that Abel will be Berkshire's next CEO, but he said Saturday that he had changed his opinion on how the company's investment portfolio should be handled. He had previously said it would fall to two investment managers who handle small chunks of the portfolio now. On Saturday, Buffett endorsed Abel for the gig, as well as overseeing the operating businesses and any acquisitions.""He understands businesses extremely well. and if you understand businesses, you understand common stocks,"" Buffett said. Ultimately, it will be up to the board to decide, but the billionaire said he might come back and haunt them if they try to do it differently.Overall, Buffett said Berkshire's system of having all the noninsurance companies report to Abel and the insurers report to Jain is working well. He himself hardly gets any calls from managers anymore because they get more guidance from Abel and Jain.""This place would work extremely well the next day if something happened to me,"" Buffett said.Nevertheless, the best applause line of the day was Buffett's closing remark: ""I not only hope that you come next year but I hope that I come next year.""","Buffett: AI has ""enormous potential for good and enormous potential for harm"" Berkshire Hathaway announces a steep drop in earnings as the paper value of its investments plummeted.

To friends, she said he was ""a stockbroker that does something with the weather."" Malinow couldn't really object - he knew most people had no clue about financial contracts based on things like rainfall and wind.That's beginning to change. Against a backdrop of rising climate volatility and social shifts, demand for weather derivatives is surging.Average trading volumes for listed products jumped more than 260% in 2023, according to the CME Group , with the number of outstanding contracts currently 48% higher than a year ago. And that publicly traded corner could make up as little as 10% of all activity, according to industry estimates; outstanding derivatives may be worth as much as $25 billion based on notional value.""There's a lot more trajectory to our business right now,"" says Malinow, the founder and chief executive officer of advisory firm Parameter Climate. ""The heightened fragility from direct weather volatility, supply-chain issues, inflation, geopolitics.

While a cat bond may pay out if a 100-year storm tears through a community, a weather derivative can compensate a tourism business if there are too many rainy days, or a farmer if a hot summer stresses her crops.Part of the jump in demand is driven by corporations newly confronting their exposure to the elements. In some cases, it's because their operations have already been impacted, in others because they're responding to investor and consumer pressures.
