New Income Tax Regime Vs Old Income Tax Regime 2024-25: Selecting the most tax-efficient income tax regime, either the old or new, can be a challenging decision for many salaried taxpayers. April is the first month of the new financial year, and employers would have asked salaried individuals to share their choice of preferred income tax regime for the purpose of TDS.One must remember that the new income tax regime is now the default tax regime and in case you don’t tell your employer your chosen tax regime, your TDS will be deducted as per the new tax regime. If at the time of filing your tax return you want to switch regimes, you can, provided the ITR is filed within the due date provided by the Income Tax Department.New Vs Old Tax Regime: Understanding the break-evenThe optimal choice between the new income tax regime and the old income tax regime depends on the amount of deductions that can be claimed from gross total income to reduce taxable income. If taxpayers are aware of their gross total income and the minimum deductions required to pay the same tax under both regimes, the decision becomes more straightforward.When the claimable deductions exceed this minimum amount, the old tax regime proves more beneficial, while the new tax regime saves more tax if the deductions fall below this threshold, explains an ET analysis.It is crucial to note that the minimum deductions necessary to equalize the tax outgo in both regimes vary based on the income level. The table provided below as part of an ET analysis illustrates the minimum deduction amounts that individuals at different gross taxable income levels must claim to achieve equal income tax payable, also known as their break-even level of deductions.From the table above, it can be seen that once the income crosses the threshold of Rs 15.5 lakh, the maximum deduction of Rs 4.25 lakh remains constant. This is because the income tax rate of 30% remains constant after income crosses Rs 15 lakh in the new tax regime. Under the old tax regime, the income tax rate of 30% becomes constant once income exceeds Rs 10 lakh. Do remember that surcharges are levied when taxable income exceeds Rs 50 lakh. Hence, for those incomes, the minimum deduction amount will vary.Also Read | New Vs Old Tax Regime: How income of even Rs 10 lakh can be tax-free under old tax regime The table is specifically designed for salaried individuals who can benefit from a standard deduction of Rs 50,000 from salary income in both tax regimes. The deduction available on the employer's contribution to NPS has not been considered when determining the break-even or minimum deduction amount. If a salaried individual claims this deduction in both regimes, the break-even or minimum deduction amount will be lower.",New Vs Old Tax Regime: Understanding the break-even. The optimal choice between the new income tax regime and the old tax regime depends on the amount of deductions that can be claimed from gross total income to reduce taxable income.

Applying for Europe travel visa?

The travel industry has welcomed the new ""favourable"" Schengen visa rules for Indians , but industry executives believe that the changes are unlikely to provide any immediate relief for those seeking to travel to Europe who have been frustrated by long appointment wait times for the past three years. However, they expect that the move will encourage more frequent travel to the continent and reduce visa queues in the future.According to an ET report, the new ""cascade"" regime announced by the European Union on Monday entails that Indians who have obtained and lawfully used two visas within the previous three years can now be issued long-term, multi-entry Schengen visas valid for two years.The Schengen visa, which is an entry permit valid for 29 European countries, including France, Germany, Spain, and Italy, must be obtained from the country that serves as the port of entry. According to the new rules, the two-year visa will typically be followed by a five-year visa, provided the passport has sufficient validity.

He points out that travellers will still have to wait for appointments to apply for thelong-term visa , which are currently unavailable for some countries. ""There is a waiting time of one or two months for dates and, many times, travellers cancel their programmes,"" he said.In Delhi, travel industry executives have reported a lack of new visa appointment slots for countries like Iceland, Portugal, and Hungary. The situation is similar in Mumbai, where no slots are available for Spain and Hungary. Bengaluru faces a shortage of appointments for Iceland, Italy, and Portugal, while Kolkata has no slots for France, Iceland, Portugal, Hungary, and Norway. The wait times for visa appointments vary, with Italy and Austria taking 35-40 days in Delhi, and Germany requiring about 90 days.

"No more OTP frauds? Home Ministry teams up with SBI Cards, telecom operators for innovative solution on stolen one-time passwords",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/no-more-otp-frauds-home-ministry-teams-up-with-sbi-cards-telecom-operators-for-innovative-solution-on-stolen-one-time-passwords/articleshow/109524380.cms,"Crooks on the prowl

No more OTP frauds? India's home ministry, SBI Cards and Payment Services Ltd (SBI Card), and telecom operators are collaborating to create a solution that will alert customers about stolen one-time passwords (OTPs) as part of a larger initiative to address the increasing risk of cyber fraud and phishing attacks on the banking system.According to two individuals familiar with the matter, the government is evaluating a solution that will enable banks to monitor a customer's registered address and the geolocation where an OTP is being delivered.If there is a discrepancy between the two locations, the customer can be notified of a potential phishing attempt, said an ET report. The solution is currently in the testing phase, and the goal is to use the telecom database to track the customer's geolocation and ensure that the OTP is being sent to the correct location.The Reserve Bank of India had advocated for an additional factor of authentication for any digital payment transaction primarily to prevent fraud. However, over time, fraudsters have developed sophisticated capabilities to either steal OTPs by deceiving unsuspecting bank customers or redirect OTPs to their own devices through fraudulent means, rendering the second factor of authentication ineffective in combating cybercrime.If there is a problem with the OTP delivery location, two steps can be taken: either an alert can be displayed on the device, or the OTP can be blocked entirely. While the specifics of the solution are still being developed with telecom companies, a customer's SIM location can be verified in real-time and compared to the geolocation of OTP delivery. Banks also have their own data on customers' residences, so capabilities will need to be developed to triangulate the data in real-time.Also Read | Getting wrong calls from loan recovery agents, unable to link number with bank account? You may have got a recycled mobile number “For instance, the customer lives in Bengaluru and the OTP is getting delivered in some place in Uttar Pradesh where the person has never been or from where the person has not made any calls recently, which means he or she is not traveling to that place; this is a typical red flag scenario,” a banker said.According to the Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (i4C), cyber criminals siphoned off as much as Rs 10,319 crore between April 2021 and December 2023. The majority of the crimes originated in China, Cambodia, and Myanmar and involved non-state actors. Under i4C, the government established the 'Citizen Financial Cyber Fraud Reporting and Management System', which has prevented approximately Rs 1,200 crore in fraudulent transfers from more than 470,000 citizen complaints received until February 2024. In the calendar year 2023, the registry received 1.12 million complaints totaling Rs 7,488 crore in fraudulent transfers.","India's home ministry, SBI Cards and Payment Services Ltd (SBI Card), and telecom operators are collaborating to create a solution that will alert customers about stolen one-time passwords.

Key tax proposals in Budget 2024:

Retained tax rates:

Waiver of old tax demands:

Extension of sunset clauses:

Tax collection at source:

Extension of Faceless Scheme time limit:

(Ravi Jain is Partner, Vialto Partners. Vikas Narang, Director and Pawan Digga, Manager at Vialto Partners contributed to the article. Views are personal)

The finance minister set the stage for a ""Viksit Bharat by 2047"", on the core principles of ‘Sabka Saath’, ‘Sabka Vikas’, ‘Sabka Vishwas’, with ‘Sabka Prayas’ being added as a new theme in the interim Budget.This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data i.e., farmer welfare and N for Nari utthan i.e., support for women entrepreneurs.These form the pillars of a comprehensive inclusive development. The Government's commitment to sustainable development under the strategy for Amrit Kaal includes achieving 'Net Zero' by 2070, rooftop solarization for one crore households and robust health initiatives.The Indian economy's resilience takes center stage amidst positive indicators of declining current account deficit as a percentage of GDP, falling unemployment rates, and a notable rise in digital transactions. These statistics affirm the robustness of the economy, showcasing a trajectory of growth and stability.The achievements in taxation reforms are nothing short of remarkable, with direct tax collections more than trebling in the last decade, the number of tax return filers increasing by 2.4 times, average processing time of tax returns plummeting from 93 days in FY 2013-14 to an impressive 10 days in FY 2023-24, resulting in issuance of quick refunds. These are the results of consistent progressive measures thus obviating the need for, and rightly avoiding, any last-minute populist measures.No change in existing tax rates, both for direct and indirect taxes, is a good indicator of stability and predictability for investors and taxpayers.A welcome move to waive outstanding tax demands that are minor, disputed, and unreconciled. This involves the withdrawal of outstanding direct tax demands up to Rs. 25,000 pertaining to the period up to FY 2009-10 and up to Rs.10,000 for FY 2010-11 to 2014-15.The Government's commitment to fostering a business-friendly environment is evident in its intent to extend specific tax benefits for start-ups, investments by sovereign wealth funds/ pension funds, and certain IFSC units. The extension has been made now until March 31, 2025. This might help in creating a conducive landscape for business.To align with the CBDT notification issued earlier, the provisions relating to tax collection at source concerning remittances under the Liberalized Remittance Scheme have now been formally incorporated in the Finance Bill, 2024, setting the rate at 20% for amounts exceeding Rs. 7 lakhs in a financial year.The Finance Bill, 2024 proposes an extension of the time limit for introducing the faceless scheme by the Central Government for transfer pricing proceedings, DRP Proceedings, and ITAT Proceedings, up to March 31, 2025.The interim Budget 2024 may not have proposed significant tax announcements, but it very well positioned the prelude to the full budget post the upcoming elections. Considering the potential impact on the population across the four pillars of GYAN, a sizable portion of India stands to be covered. The interim Budget’s focus on the tax front resembles a report card, highlighting the maturity achieved by our tax system. The enhancement of taxpayer services was emphasized as a key priority.","This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data and N for Nari utthan.

Interim Budget for a Viksit Bharat: It’s for everyone and all,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/interim-budget-for-a-viksit-bharat-its-for-everyone-and-all/articleshow/107497439.cms,"By Akhilesh Tuteja

The Finance Minister on February 01, 2024, delivered a truly innovative interim budget. At first glance, it did not seem like an interim budget but looked more like the budget to drive further growth and a continuum of inclusive growth-oriented investments.At the outset, this budget brings a wonderful balance between fiscal prudence and continued investment for growth.It's not easy to continue the glide path of reducing the fiscal deficit and continuing to make significant investments in all areas including infrastructure, R&D, energy transition, technology, skilling, and social welfare. The surprising reduction in fiscal deficit of 5.8% as against the budgeted 5.9% for FY24 and the projection of 5.1% in FY25 with a clear focus on increasing investments was a huge positive.This was a budget for everyone and all because it caters to every part of the Indian economy and society. The FM has carefully catered to the investment needs of various sectors. The continued focus on youth, impoverished, women and farmers to increase their involvement and contribution to economic growth is evident. By committing an 11.1% increase in capital expenditure to 11,11,111 lakh crore, the FM has clearly brought every single 1 in this growth journey.What was very impressive was the inclusion strategy of the government. The focus on women's empowerment for the past few years is unprecedented, which is reflected in the inclusion of women in the workforce moving from 23.3% to 37% in the last five years. The thirty crore Mudra Yojna loans to women entrepreneurs were a great boost to the Nari Shakti initiative. We already have over 10 million Lakhpati Didis and what is truly evident is like a corporate CFO, the FM has revised the earlier target of 20 million Lakhpati Didis to 30 million. The government also plans to invest in initiatives to encourage young girls between the ages of 9 and 14 to undertake the vaccination for cervical cancer which is again a great boost to Nari Shakti.A lot needs to be done to bring more women into all parts of economic growth but the journey so far and the vision of the future is truly inspiring.While India continues on its technological prowess and makes its mark in new technologies like Artificial Intelligence, we need a multi-pronged strategy to harness the power of AI. We need a clear focus on building AI systems in India so that we not only emerge as a global leader in this new era but can build models, which are specific to India that will benefit Indians. At the same time, we need a very wide coverage program to build skills to leverage AI to its fullest potential. The biggest contribution we can make to the inclusion of youth in the economic development of the country is by skilling them in new skill areas. In the last few years, the Skill India Mission has trained 14 million youth, reskilled over 5 million youth and established a staggering 3,000 new ITIs. The future of any country will depend as much on capital investments as on skill investments.The focus on agricultural development and support to the farmer continues through direct financial assistance to farmers. The farmers have benefited by getting crop insurance through PM Fasal Bima Yojana. It's not just the farmers, the PM-SVANidhi provides credit assistance to a large number of street vendors.The last few years have seen the journey of affordable housing through Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY). There is a slight increase in allocation to launch a scheme for encouraging the middle class to build or buy new homes. This investment will likely propel a wider economic development and increase employment.India has seen a tremendous rise in entrepreneurship in the last few years. In order to continue the journey and promote new startups, the government proposes to extend certain tax benefits, which are expiring from March 2024 to March 2025. The MSMEs have not been left behind. With a proposal to provide timely finances to such enterprises, the government has paved the way for their growth, so they can look to compete globally.All in all, it’s a truly inclusive budget with a clear focus on development not just by giving away freebies but enabling the people to participate in the economic development activity. While the FM calls the comprehensive GDP - Governance, Development & Performance – to me, this budget is inclusive of another GDP – gender, demography, and professions.","Akhilesh Tuteja is Partner and Head, Clients and Markets, KPMG in India.

‘Enough domestic sources of demand to counter drag from external sector’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/enough-domestic-sources-of-demand-to-counter-drag-from-external-sector/articleshow/107372012.cms,"Do you think the

creates room for lower interest rates?

One of the issues that the Budget has flagged is the demographic challenge and opportunity and the societal change that is taking place. How do you view this?

Niti Aayog is working on the Viksit Bharat roadmap. What will be the focus areas?

You are as much a representative of the Centre as well as the states. Is it time to revisit the entire formula for transfers to states particularly on the issue of cesses and surcharges?

Suman Bery , who heads Niti Aayog , the govt think tank, is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China, which he says is also an opportunity for India. The economist is confident that Indian states remain resilient. Excerpts of the interview with TOI.The finance ministry expects the economy to grow 7% next year.Given the global situation, how do you see the prospects?The belief in the finance ministry is that we have a possible drag coming from the external sector but that we have other sources. We have enough domestic sources of demand. One has to applaud the political and economic judgment of FM in deciding that it was appropriate to pursue the path of fiscal consolidation. There is transparency. What this actually reflects is responsible economic management, which is one reason we are where we are. Second, it also creates a buffer so that there is policy space if we do encounter headwinds.That’s the hope and expectation. We have an independent central bank and an inflation targeting central bank, so it is up to the monetary policy committee to take a call through the monetary policy committee on the repo rate .The PM has said that when India grows its states grow. India is a composite of 37 states and UTs. They are each at very different points in their demographic transition. There are some states where the net replacement rate is down to 1%, like Kerala . There are others, particularly UP and Bihar, which are in their earliest stage of demographic transition and each one of these states is the size of a large European country. There are two implications of that — one is internal labour mobility and it will become an even larger part of our growth model. The govt has taken several steps to create a unified market. Our main endowment is our human capital and that has to be equipped to participate in global exchange in many ways. We know from China, Japan that the demographic dividend partly depends on markets and on human capital. But the golden period is fairly short lived, about 15 years, when the so called dependency ratio declines. The other big opportunity the PM has been highlighting is bringing women much more into the active labour force.When Niti was set up there was the idea of a three-year vision and a seven-year strategy paper. The reality is that schemes of govt tend to be aligned with the award of the Finance Commission . There are various established building blocks or hand holds which are already a matter of govt policy. The PM is much more interested in a national debate on what it means to be a Viksit Bharat or modern society. We have a collective goal and it is for the democratic polity to define what that goal should be. Its emphatically not for a super mandarin bureaucracy. It is not going to be Lee Kwan Yew’s Singapore led from the top.It’s entirely a finance ministry matter but I would be lying if I didn’t say when I visit certain states there is this complaint. A big frontier would be resource mobilisation at the state level. Second is going to be rationalisation of subsidies not only at the Union level, but also at the state level. All chief ministers sit on my governing council. When they convene as the governing council, I see them in their role as development practitioners. The world is beginning to appreciate quite how much institutional and political maturity India attained in our 75 years and the most fundamental dimension of a democracy, we have orderly transfers of power. There are enough buffers to ensure that what happens in state finances is unlikely to create macro instability. Those risks are well contained by our Constitution. The chief ministers know that they are going to be judged by development outcomes and so you can have the sugar rush of changing of pension plans or various handouts but if the cupboard is bare you are not going to be able to deliver.","Suman Bery is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China.

Government's Marathon to 2047: Emphasis on Fiscal Prudence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/governments-marathon-to-2047-emphasis-on-fiscal-prudence/articleshow/107371788.cms,"What was the thinking behind keeping the vote on account absolutely straight?

So is it the idea to keep the Budget completely transparent?

The capex has risen 11.1% and there is an emphasis on infrastructure spending. But there is also the hope that the private sector will now take over and start capital spending. Given the geopolitical situation, how confident is the govt that it will pan out as planned?

Finance secretary T V Somanathan, in an interview with TOI, says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047 . Excerpts:If you see the Budget speech you will see the emphasis on 2047. The govt has set its sight on running that marathon.Running to 2047 is a marathon , it’s not a sprint. If you are going to run a marathon, you need to be in good shape and you can’t have short-term stimulants or something that will get you some yards and then it’s done.The whole focus is on making India a developed country by 2047, for which a healthy present and a strong fiscal position is an important concomitant. Some purely short term measures don’t really fit into that picture. It’s a consistent picture: focus on the long term for which you need to build strength in the short term and that needs to be done by prudence in fiscal policy and by not doing things which can detract you from that path. Not doing the wrong thing is more important than appearing to do things.The idea is that govt finances may be good, bad or indifferent depending on the times, depending on the circumstances, depending on the policies. But what is the position should be reflected as reasonably and accurately as possible. That is an emphasis. As regards the Finance Commission, again the terms of reference that have been given to them are the terms in the Constitution.What is the means by which the devolution should be done is a matter they have full discretion. They can actually take all kinds of factors into account and in a sense we felt this time based on my review of the previous commissions that the right expression would be less is more. The shorter, less prescriptive terms of reference gives full scope for all stakeholders including state govts to express their viewpoints and for the commission to take a balanced view of the different perspectives and then come to its award. Ultimately the award of the Finance Commission is about devolution and grant for which full scope has now been given to them.n There are incipient signs of private capital expenditure accelerating. There are some surveys I have seen done by some of the chambers industry, which show high levels of investment. The PMI, which is a sort of leading indicator, is also looking pretty healthy. Capacity utilisation is one reason that private sector capital expenditure doesn’t immediately pick up when the economy starts accelerating because there is surplus capacity.But increasingly I get the sense that many industries are beginning to reach levels where they have to add capacity. When that happens capital investment will happen. Another pointer also mentioned in the Budget speech you may notice that our airlines have placed large orders for planes — that is capital expenditure.When you import 1,000 aircraft, it’s just not 1,000 aircraft, there are concomitant additions to ground handling facilities, you need airports to expand, you need to employ people to do that. That means a lot of jobs. The aircraft is capital but then look at the effect it is going to have on skilled jobs. So capital expenditure is happening. I am fairly confident that we will have decent capital expenditure in the year to come and that will become a new source of acceleration.",Finance secretary T V Somanathan says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047.

What is the Section 80C limit for tax deduction for FY 2024-25 after Interim Budget 2024?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/income-tax-budget-2024-2024-2025-section-80c-limit-epf-ppf-elss-nsc/articleshow/107353021.cms,"ALSO READ |

Income Tax Changes Budget 2024 : In the recent Budget 2024 speech, the Finance Minister kept the Section 80C tax deduction limit unchanged. The maximum limit for claiming tax benefits under Section 80C remains at Rs 1.5 lakh for the current fiscal year 2023-24 and will stay the same for individuals looking to save on taxes through Section 80C investments in the upcoming fiscal year 2024-25.Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions. Individuals can reduce their gross taxable income by up to Rs 1.5 lakh per financial year by engaging in these specific investments or expenditures.You can save on taxes through Section 80C by investing in things like Employees' Provident Fund (EPF), Public Provident Fund (PPF), Equity Linked Saving Scheme (ELSS) mutual funds, National Savings Certificate (NSC), and 5-year tax-saving fixed deposits with banks or post offices. Additionally, paying life insurance policy premiums also qualifies for tax benefits under Section 80C.It is important to note that each eligible investment comes with its specific maximum limit, rate of return, liquidity, and taxation rules for the earned returns, states ET in a report. For instance, the most you can invest in PPF in a financial year is Rs 1.5 lakh. Meanwhile, there's no limit on the amount you can invest in ELSS mutual funds, but the Section 80C deduction is capped at Rs 1.5 lakh.If individuals can't make specific investments, they can still get deductions under Section 80C from their gross taxable income through certain expenses. These expenses include repaying the principal amount of a home loan, tuition fees for children, payment of stamp duty, registration fees, and other costs related to buying a house.Since the financial year 2020-21, individuals without any business income must annually choose between the old and new tax regimes. As of the fiscal year 2023-24, the new tax regime is the default option. Consequently, individuals seeking tax deductions under Section 80C must opt for the old tax regime since this deduction isn't available in the new tax regime. It's crucial for taxpayers to be aware of these rules to make informed decisions about their tax planning and investment strategies.","Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget which is an interim budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year. The budget talks about inclusive development both, social and geographical, especially for youth, women, farmers, and the poor. Continued focus on improving logistics through infrastructure spend on roads, rail, airports, ports increases productivity for companies and citizens alike.To make ‘Viksit Bharat’ by 2047, the government’s focus is on improving and empowering people’s capabilities through various skilling initiatives. It is encouraging to see that Skill India Mission has succeeded in training more than 1.4 crore youth and upskilling and reskilling 54 lakh youth. I am particularly happy to see the continued focus on youth and women entrepreneurship and the announcement of a new fund which will give interest free 50 year loans for startups will provide a domestic fillip to startups supplementing venture capital we have traditionally relied on from abroad.PM Mudra Yojana has sanctioned 43 crore loans aggregating to 22.5 lakh crore to youth entrepreneurs and thirty crore Mudra Yojana loans to women entrepreneurs. There are several other schemes like Fund of Funds, Start-Up India, and Start-Up Credit Guarantee schemes that are assisting our youth. Further, the extension of tax benefits to Start-ups and investments made by sovereign wealth funds/pension funds, till 31st March 2025 depicts the government’s effort to support the startup eco- system.This aligns quite well with India Sanitation Coalition’s efforts to give impetus to the start-up world. Over the past 7 editions of our ISC-FICCI Sanitation Awards, we have recognized and promoted several start-ups in the sanitation space, many of whom are successful businesses now!While the finance minister did not provide detailed information on Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH), the budget allocation sees a slight increase in spend demonstrating continued focus on this highly successful program. The acknowledgement that the private sector has increasingly played a substantial role in addressing WASH issues in both urban and rural areas, with numerous projects underway through Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs), highlights the government's commitment to addressing challenges in this sector.A perfect example is the LightHouse Initiative initiated by the Department of Drinking Water along with the India Sanitation Coalition (ISC) by partnering with major corporates across India to develop model villages in Solid and Liquid Waste Management (SLWM) under SBM-Grameen. From this budget, there is an expectation that the government will persist in prioritizing Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) as the path toward achieving the country's Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6). Additionally, it is hoped that the government will uphold its commitment to making necessary infrastructural investments for SLWM.The budget speech rightly celebrates the fact that we have 83 lakh SHGs and 9 crore women beneficiaries. The microfinance movement in the country and the possibility of empowering women members of SHGs through livelihood skilling is a key to bringing women into mainstream economic advancement.The focus on green growth, rooftop solar, wind, biomass, e-vehicles all help with our green energy thrust. The tourism sector was mentioned and could be a huge job provider for youth and women.Guided by the principle ‘Reform, Perform, and Transform’, the budget emphasizes efficient implementation of various policies by improving coordination with states and relevant stakeholders. This is critical both for infra spend and social programsIt is noteworthy that ISC’s Climate Resilient Coastal Cities project which is being implemented in PPP (Public-Private Partnership) mode in four coastal states of Karnataka, Gujarat, Goa and Maharashtra is congruent with the government’s priority of promoting climate-resilient activities for the blue economy 2.0, a scheme for restoration and adaptation measures, and coastal aquaculture.The budget also focuses on the Aspirational districts program where assistance will be given to the states for faster development of aspirational districts and blocks, including the generation of ample economic opportunities. This is again very crucial as it has a huge potential to transform the landscape of our country while making sure no -one is left behind.Overall, this budget has embraced economic strategies and develops the building blocks that nurture and uphold growth, promote inclusive and sustainable development, and enhance productivity.","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year.

"Kerala High Court classifies Malabar 'Parota' as akin to bread, subject to lower GST @5%",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/kerala-high-court-classifies-malabar-parota-as-akin-to-bread-subject-to-lower-gst-5/articleshow/109577506.cms,"Third-time lucky! This aptly describes the victory in the arena of Goods and Services Tax (GST) by ‘Parota’ manufacturer and supplier, Modern Food Enterprises . After unsuccessful rulings given by the Authority for Advance Rulings, and later its Appellate Bench, the Kerala high court finally held that Malabar ‘Parota’ is akin to bread , as it has the same ingredients and should be subject to 5% GST and not 18% as was held by the other quasi-judicial forums.Tax experts state that advance rulings are binding on the parties with respect to the transaction on which the ruling is sought. However, they do have a persuasive impact in assessment of similar cases. A high court order, on the other hand, sets judicial precedent. Fear of litigation may however keep manufacturers in other states from following this high court ruling.Modern Food contended that if products covered under ‘Heading 1905’ – which include bread, pastry, cakes, biscuits…are examined, it is evident that their parota have almost the same/similar ingredients.It added that: Parotas are semi-cooked for marketing purposes to retain the optimal shelf-life and moisture, so that upon pre-heating, they remain soft and taste good. Like pizza base or pappad these products are classifiable under ‘Heading 1905’ and not ‘Entry 2106’ (which covers residual food preparations) as was held in the advance rulings.Justice Dinesh Kumar Singh, in his order delivered earlier this month, agreed with this submission.In Sept 2021, the Gujarat Bench of the AAR had held that frozen parathas are not rotis and subjected Vadilal Industries to a GST of 18%. Earlier in July 2020, a similar stand had been taken by the Karnataka bench of the AAR, in the case of ID Fresh Food. Both these rulings were covered by TOI.Complex classification norms and multiplicity of slabs often lead to an endless bout of litigation. Advance rulings, which at times differ from state to state, often do not help set the matter at rest, till the GST Central Council steps in, which is followed by a notification specifying the rate or clarifying the issue. Merging some slabs could be one of the first steps towards simplicity, says an industry expert.",Kerala high court held that Malabar ‘Parota’ is akin to bread. It should be subject to 5% GST and not 18% as was held by the other quasi-judicial forums.

Infosys narrows revenue gap with Cognizant,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/infosys-narrows-revenue-gap-with-cognizant/articleshow/109573389.cms,"BENGALURU: Twelve years ago, Cognizant crossed Infosys in revenue rankings to become the No. 2 Indian-heritage IT services company. Over the following few years, such was its growth that it hugely expanded its lead over Infosys. However, the tables have turned. In the next few quarters, if current trends and forecasts stand, there's a possibility of Infosys reclaiming the No.2 spot.The difference between the two companies' revenues has narrowed drastically over the past five years. Cognizant's revenue in 2019 was $16.8 billion, while that of Infosys's in the same calendar year was $12.5 billion, a difference of $4.3 billion.In 2023, Cognizant's revenue was $19.4 billion, while that of Infosys's was $18.4 billion, a difference of just $1 billion. This narrowing is expected to continue into this year, considering Infosys has guided for a 1% to 3% revenue growth for financial year 2024-25, while Cognizant has guided for 2024 revenue to be between $19 billion and $19.8 billion (-2% to 2%).Peter Bendor-Samuel, CEO of Everest Research, says if the current trajectory of both firms continues, Infosys will become larger than Cognizant. However, he says, one should be careful not to discount Cognizant and its new CEO, Ravi Kumar (who was previously president at Infosys). ""With a year under his belt, Ravi has had a chance to rally the troops and refocus Cognizant. The first year has been one of investment and realignment, and we have yet to see the results of these changes. As we enter the next year, it is quite possible that the investments and realignment Ravi has put in place will start to take hold, and Cognizant's performance is likely to improve. This will set up an interesting horse race, with a different storyline than what has been playing out over the last few years,"" he says.Phil Fersht, CEO of HfS Research, says the focus across all the major players ""is shifting to profitability over revenue growth, plus their ability to win strategic deals based on outcomes and capability-building, not merely labour arbitrage scale."" He says he expects consolidation to ramp up in the next few months, with both Infosys and Cognizant making strategic acquisitions. ""The size of both companies could be very different by the end of this year,"" he says.For most IT services companies in recent times, the BFSI sector has been a pain point. But it has been particularly so for Cognizant. In the past four years, revenue contribution from this industry has dropped by almost 5 percentage points, from about 35% of revenue to 29% of revenue. It has dropped even in absolute terms - from $1.4 billion in the December quarter of 2019 to $1.3 billion in the December quarter of 2023. Cognizant counts JP Morgan, UBS, First Data, Keycorp, and MetLife as some of its key customers. Many banking customers are expanding their tech centres in India, building capabilities in-house, instead of outsourcing to IT firms.An analyst, who did not want to be named, said what's more concerning for Ravi Kumar is the loss of senior talent, which was called out in its 2023 annual report. ""The institutional knowledge in the company has been materially depleted,"" he said.""The institutional knowledge in the company has been materially depleted,” he said, noting also that the company’s extremely high attrition rates in the past few years meant most people in the company are new. “How much of Cognizant is left in Cognizant?” he wonders.","Cognizant crossed Infosys in revenue rankings to become the No. 2 Indian- heritage IT services company.

Benchmark Brent crude steadied at $88 per barrel, losing the upward momentum of the previous session on the back of a surprise fall in US crude stockpile , indicating higher-than-expected demand, and a weakened dollar.“Risk premia feeds on headlines. Since the headlines (on Israel-Iran conflict ) have become more tepid and there is no report of disruption in oil supply, the fear factor behind risk premia has also lost its effect,” a top executive of a refining company said, requesting anonymity.Perceived de-escalation between Iran and Israel could remove another $5-10 a barrel of ""the still elevated geopolitical risk premium"" in coming months, Reuters reported quoting a Goldman Sachs analyst note, putting a $90 per barrel ceiling on Brent.Last Friday, reports by Goldman Sachs, Citi Research and Jeffries week discounted for now the possibility of a wider conflict but projected elevated Brent in the $85-$95 range.This is a mixed bag for India, which depends on imports for 83% of oil and 50% of gas. An open supply line is a relief. But the high import dependence also leaves the country vulnerable elevated prices and/or market volatility.High oil prices jack up the country’s import bill, which impacts the current account deficit and weakens the rupee, squeezing government headroom for social sector spending.

PM Modi's salvos likely part of bigger attack on Congress manifesto's 'equity' section,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-modis-salvos-likely-part-of-bigger-attack-on-congress-manifestos-equity-section/articleshow/109542241.cms,"Lok Sabha Election 2024: PM Modi Repeats ‘Wealth Redistribution’ Attack On Congress, A Day After 'Muslim' Remark Triggers Row

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi's focus Tuesday on Congress's efforts to introduce quota for Muslims marks a significant escalation of BJP's ""appeasement"" charge against the opposition party.PM fired the ""Muslim quota"" salvo while addressing a rally at Tonk-Sawai Madhopur in Rajasthan - his last engagement in the state for Lok Sabha polls - and said Congress has for long made separate efforts to implement Muslim quota despite the prohibition laid down on ""Babasaheb Ambedkar's Constitution"" on religion-based reservations.The attack came even as Congress was still angrily protesting against PM's remark at Banswara, also in Rajasthan, on Sunday that Congress's pitch for "" redistribution of assets "" was part of a plan to take away assets from people and distribute among people who, going by his predecessor Manmohan Singh's 2006 speech at the National Development Council, can only be Muslims.While Election Commission has started an inquiry into Congress's complaint that that Banswara speech was communal and, therefore, violative of the 'model code of conduct', PM Modi repeated the charge and rebutted Congress's protest about Singh's statement having been distorted, saying, ""I was present at the meeting of the NDC.""Going by indications, the PM's consecutive volleys could be part of a larger offensive against the ""equity"" section of the Congress manifesto for allegedly seeking to create an opening for Muslims not just in jobs and education, but also in healthcare, public contracts, skill development, even sports - something which might push the electoral contest from now on to the ""secular-communal"" terrain.Highlighting extracts from the ""equity"" section of the Congress manifesto, BJP said that it implied Muslim reservation. ""Point 3 of the Congress manifesto says 'encourage' minorities to take full advantage of opportunities but Point 6 says 'ensure' minorities receive 'fair share' on exactly the same issues as mentioned in Point 3,"" a senior BJP leader said and added, ""if Congress manifesto had limited itself to just 'encourage', then it would have been OK. But how will Congress ensure? Such language is employed when the intent is to back the promise with legislative action.""Congress manifesto in ""equity"" section says that it will do socio-economic census (different from caste census) and then basis this it will strengthen affirmative action (Point 1). Same section also says in Point 2 that the 50% limit on reservations will be raised. ""Read together, only one conclusion follows. Congress plans to install Muslim reservation - not just in education and jobs but also in healthcare, public contracts, skill development, cultural activities and even sports?"" the BJP leader said.Congress in its manifesto in 2009 Lok Sabha polls had promised nationwide reservation for Muslims in jobs and education. The idea was to create a Muslim sub-quota within the 27% OBC quota. Although it could not be implemented due to legal hurdles but Congress in its manifesto in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls again mentioned that the UPA govt had taken steps to address the condition of backward Muslims by aiming to provide them reservation in educational institutions and govt jobs and further added, ""We will pursue this matter closely in court to ensure that the policy is implemented through proper legislation"".The saffron party made a recall that Congress launched its pilot project to introduce Muslim quota in Andhra Pradesh after coming to power in 2004 when it made four attempts between 2004-10 to implement Muslim reservation. ""Each time the Andhra HC/SC quashed the pernicious attempts of Congress. Unashamed, the UPA then tried the Muslim reservation at ventral level in 2011. Even this attempt was stalled by Andhra HC in2012 and SC agreed with HC,"" a BJP leader said.In Karnataka, Congress promised to reinstate Muslim reservation that the BJP govt had scrapped. And finally in its 2024 manifesto, Congress talks of expanding affirmative action after socio-economic survey - breach 50% limit set by courts and ""ensure"" Muslims receive their ""fair share"" in jobs, education and even sports.""In UPA-1, Ranganath Mishra Commission recommended 10% reservation for Muslims, which Congress gave in Andhra despite being rejected by the high court. Congress removed all reservation of SC/ST OBC from AMU and Jamia Millia Islamia to provide for Muslims,"" said BJP spokesperson and Rajya Sabha MP Sudhanshu Trivedi.He said in Kashmir, Congress never allowed SC/ST and OBCs to have reservation in representation on the pretext that it is a Muslim majority state and the Muslim Waqf Board by law became the biggest land owner after the Govt of India, due to successive Congress-led govts.","PM fired the ""Muslim quota"" salvo while addressing a rally at Tonk-Sawai Madhopur in Rajasthan. He said Congress has for long made separate efforts to implement Muslim quota.

Boeing posts a $355 million loss as the plane maker tries to dig out from under its latest crisis,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/boeing-posts-a-355-million-loss-as-the-plane-maker-tries-to-dig-out-from-under-its-latest-crisis/articleshow/109564327.cms,"Boeing said Wednesday that it lost $355 million on falling revenue in the first quarter, another sign of the crisis gripping the aircraft manufacturer as it faces increasing scrutiny over the safety of its planes and accusations of shoddy work from a growing number of whistleblowers.Boeing's CEO said the company is in “a tough moment,” and its focus is on fixing its manufacturing issues , not the financial results .Company executives have been forced to talk more about safety and less about finances since a door plug blew out of a Boeing 737 Max during an Alaska Airlines flight in January, leaving a gaping hole in the plane.The accident halted progress that Boeing seemed to be making while recovering from two deadly crashes of Max jets in 2018 and 2019.Now those crashes are back in the spotlight, too. Later Wednesday, families of some of the 346 people killed in the crashes are scheduled to meet with U.S. Justice Department officials. Family members have tried unsuccessfully to undo a 2021 settlement between the department and Boeing that let the company avoid criminal prosecution.“Although we report first-quarter financial results today, our focus remains on the sweeping actions we are taking following the Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 accident,” Boeing CEO David Calhoun told employees in a memo Wednesday.Calhoun ticked off a series of actions the company is taking and reported “significant progress” in improving manufacturing quality, much of it by slowing down production, which means fewer planes for its airline customers.“Near term, yes, we are in a tough moment,” he wrote. “Lower deliveries can be difficult for our customers and for our financials. But safety and quality must and will come above all else.”Calhoun, who will step down at the end of the year, said again he is fully confident the company will recover.Boeing said the first-quarter loss, excluding special items came to $1.13 per share, which was better than the loss of $1.63 per share that analysts had forecast, according to a FactSet survey.Revenue fell 7.5%, to $16.57 billion.Company shares gained more than 3% in premarket trading.Boeing stock has plunged by about one-third since the Alaska Airlines door-plug blowout. The Federal Aviation Administration has stepped up its oversight and given Boeing until late May to produce a plan to fix its problems. Airline customers are unhappy about not getting all the new planes that they had ordered because of delivery disruptions.Boeing, however, has a couple things in its favor.Along with Airbus, Boeing forms one-half of a duopoly that dominates the manufacturing of large passenger planes. And it is a major defense contractor for the Pentagon and governments around the world.Richard Aboulafia, a longtime industry analyst and consultant at AeroDynamic Advisory, said despite all the setbacks Boeing still has a powerful mix of products in high demand, technology and people.“Even if they are No. 2 and have major issues, they are still in a very strong market and an industry that has very high barriers to entry,” he said.And despite massive losses — about $24 billion in the last five years — the company is not at risk of failing, Aboulafia said.“This isn’t General Motors in 2008 or Lockheed in 1971,” Aboulafia said, referring to two iconic corporations that needed massive government bailouts or loan guarantees to survive.All of those factors help explain why 20 analysts in a FactSet survey rate Boeing shares as “Buy” or “Overweight” and only two have “Sell” ratings.","Boeing lost $355 million on falling revenue in the first quarter.

US Congress passes divest-or-ban bill on TikTok: What happens now,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-congress-passes-divest-or-ban-bill-on-tiktok-what-happens-now/articleshow/109547042.cms,"What is the main objective of the recent US legislation regarding TikTok?

How will TikTok respond to the legislation?

What changes will TikTok users in the US notice in the interim?

What are the potential consequences if ByteDance does not comply with the divestiture order?

How does the Chinese government view this legislation?

On Tuesday, the US Senate passed a bill mandating that the highly popular social media platform TikTok be sold off from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance , or face exclusion from the US market. This legislation forms a part of a substantial $95 billion foreign aid package that includes military support for Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan, and has successfully passed through Congress to await President Joe Biden 's signature.Concerns have been raised by US and other Western officials regarding TikTok's immense popularity among the youth, suggesting that it enables the Chinese government to gather data and conduct surveillance on its users, who number 170 million in the United States alone. Critics contend that TikTok acts in subordination to Beijing and serves as a medium for disseminating propaganda. However, these allegations are vehemently refuted by both China and the company.This legislative action, which might lead to the unprecedented exclusion of a company from the US market, received approval in the Senate with a vote of 79-18, following strong bipartisan support in the House of Representatives three days earlier. President Biden has expressed his intention to sign the bill into law.The primary goal of the legislation is to compel ByteDance to divest its TikTok operations in the US within a specified timeframe—about nine months, with a potential three-month extension if necessary. This drastic step is intended to mitigate concerns that the Chinese government could access US user data or manipulate content to conduct espionage and spread propaganda.TikTok is expected to challenge the constitutionality of the legislation through the legal system. Immediately after the bill becomes law, TikTok may seek a preliminary injunction to halt its enforcement, thereby allowing the company to continue operations while the court considers the case. This legal approach is consistent with TikTok's previous strategies in confronting restrictive measures from US authorities.Until the legal and corporate battles are resolved, TikTok users in the US are unlikely to experience any immediate changes to their app usage. The platform will continue to operate as usual, providing content tailored to individual preferences through its sophisticated algorithm, unless a court ruling or the completion of the divestiture alters the status quo.If ByteDance fails to sell TikTok within the allotted timeframe and no legal injunctions are in place, the app could be removed from major US app stores, effectively cutting off new downloads and potentially limiting functionality for existing installations. This would not only impact users but also millions of businesses that utilize the platform for marketing and community engagement.The Chinese government has opposed the forced sale of TikTok and is likely to view this legislation as another strain on US-China relations. China's regulation of technology exports, including algorithms like those used by TikTok, could complicate any potential sale, adding another layer of complexity to the negotiations and international diplomatic interactions.(With inputs from agencies)","On Tuesday, the US Senate passed a bill mandating that the highly popular social media platform TikTok be sold off from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance.
