"China+1 strategy a success for smartphones? India fast bridging gap with China, Vietnam on phone exports",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/china1-strategy-a-success-for-smartphones-india-fast-bridging-gap-with-china-vietnam-on-phone-exports/articleshow/111394710.cms,"India's Rising Share in Smartphone Exports

India’s China+1 strategy a success? India is rapidly closing in on China and Vietnam in terms of mobile phone exports . According to global trade data cited by officials, while China and Vietnam experienced declines of 2.78% and 17.6% respectively in FY24 compared to the previous year, India's exports surged by an impressive 40.5%.Moreover, officials have told ET that India has captured nearly half of the reduction in corresponding mobile phone exports from China and Vietnam.This indicates that the goal of securing a significant portion of the supply chain shift from China has been achieved, an official told the financial daily.The official, speaking anonymously, remarked, ""The smartphone production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme was announced with an objective to capture supply chain shifts from China. The results are beginning to show now."" Although China remains the leading exporter of mobile phones, India appears to be narrowing the gap.India's success in capturing a significant share of the mobile phone export market is a major victory for the government, according to experts. The government has been working to attract companies that are implementing the China+1 strategy to diversify their supply chains and manufacturing operations, taking advantage of the current geopolitical situation and tensions with China.According to data from the International Trade Centre (ITC), Chinese mobile phone exports decreased from $136.3 billion in FY23 to $132.5 billion in FY24, a 2.8% reduction amounting to a $3.8 billion decline in total exports. Similarly, Vietnam experienced a fall in mobile exports from $31.9 billion in FY23 to $26.27 billion in FY24, a 17.6% reduction, or a $5.6 billion decline in total exports. The combined reduction in exports from both countries totaled $9.4 billion.Also Read | Apple ecosystem becomes biggest blue-collar job creator in India! 1.5 lakh direct jobs created since PLI scheme India's mobile phone exports, on the other hand, have risen by over 40% to reach $15.6 billion in FY24 from $11.1 billion in FY23, an increase of $4.5 billion. Another official commented, ""The data implies that India captured nearly 50% of the total decline in mobile exports from China and Vietnam.""The smartphone PLI scheme has proven to be effective, especially with Apple establishing India as its second-largest iPhone manufacturing base after China. Following the scheme's introduction in 2020, three of Apple's key iPhone suppliers – Foxconn, Pegatron, and Wistron (now owned by Tata) – established factories in India. As a result, Apple has doubled its production and exports from India over the past two fiscal years.According to data provided by Apple's vendors to the Ministry of Electronics and IT (MeitY) under the PLI scheme, production increased from $7 billion in FY23 to $14 billion in FY24, while exports rose from $5 billion to over $10 billion during the same period.Also Read | 5 lakh ‘Apployments’: Apple ecosystem to create huge number of jobs in 3 years; iPhone maker may move half its supply chain from China to India iPhone exports alone account for 65% of India's $15.6 billion mobile exports and more than one-third of the country's electronics exports, which surpassed $29 billion in FY24.Officials also expect companies like Samsung to increase their mobile phone exports from India. Samsung, another beneficiary of the PLI scheme, exported around $3.5 billion worth of mobile phones from India in FY24, which was one-third of Apple's exports.Currently, Samsung is the largest exporter of mobile phones from Vietnam. According to a report by Vietnam News Agency in January 2024, Samsung had invested $20 billion in Vietnam as of late 2023, with more than 50% of its products sold worldwide being manufactured in the country.","India is rapidly closing in on China and Vietnam in terms of mobile phone exports.

Income Tax Return Filing: Is it compulsory to file ITR if income does not exceed Rs 7 lakh?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/taxation/income-tax-return-filing-is-it-compulsory-to-file-itr-if-income-does-not-exceed-rs-7-lakh/articleshow/111366661.cms,"For FY 2023-24 (AY 2024-25), the basic exemption limits under the old tax regime are:

When is ITR filing mandatory irrespective of income level?

To better understand these requirements, consider the following examples:

What are the consequences of not filing ITR, even if you are mandated to?

Income Tax Return Filing FY 2023-24: If your income is below Rs 7 lakh, then you may be wondering if you need to file your Income Tax Return. The first important point to note is that filing ITR is very different from paying income tax. Filing an income tax return (ITR) is compulsory if your gross taxable income surpasses the basic exemption limit or if you have carried out specific transactions.However, this does not always imply that you are required to pay income tax.The deadline for filing ITR for the current assessment year is July 31, 2024, for individuals who are not required to undergo an income tax audit for FY 2023-24 (AY 2024-25). Apart from income, there are additional factors that make filing ITR mandatory.Under section 87A of the Income Tax Act, 1961, you are eligible for a tax rebate if your net taxable income is within Rs 5 lakh ( old tax regime ) or Rs 7 lakh ( new tax regime ).The maximum tax rebate available is Rs 12,500 under the old tax regime and Rs 25,000 under the new tax regime. As a result, if your income falls within the specified levels, you are not obligated to pay any income tax. Nevertheless, even if your tax liability becomes zero due to the tax rebate, filing an ITR is still necessary, according to an ET report.""Generally, taxpayers have a mis-understanding that if tax is not payable then filing of ITR is also not mandatory,"" says Sudhir Kaushik, Co-founder and CEO, Taxspanner.com was quoted as saying.According to Kaushik, filing ITR is obligatory if your gross total income , before deductions under Chapter VI (Sections 80C, 80D, etc.), is more than the basic exemption limit.Also Check | ITR e-Filing FY 2023-24: Which Is The Correct Income Tax Return Form For You? From ITR-1 To ITR-7 - Check Here * Rs 2.5 lakh for individuals below 60 years of age* Rs 3.0 lakh for individuals above 60 years but below 80 years of age* Rs 5.0 lakh for individuals above 80 years of ageUnder the new tax regime, the basic exemption limit for all categories of taxpayers is Rs 3 lakh for FY 2023-24 (AY 2024-25).According to Neeraj Agarwala, Partner at Nangia Andersen India, there are certain situations where individuals must file an ITR regardless of their gross total income:* If an individual's annual bank deposits in one or more savings accounts surpass Rs 50 lakh, they are obligated to file an ITR.* Individuals whose electricity bill exceeds Rs 1 lakh during the year must file an ITR.* Those who own assets in a foreign country, are beneficiaries of such assets, or have signing authority in any overseas account must file an ITR.* Professionals earning more than Rs 10 lakh during a financial year are required to file an ITR.* If a person's TDS/TCS is more than Rs 25,000 (or Rs 50,000 for senior citizens), filing an ITR is compulsory.* Individuals who spend Rs 2 lakh or more on foreign travel for themselves or others during the financial year are required to file an ITR.Also Read | ITR filing FY 2023-24: Why is Form 16 important for salaried individuals when filing income tax return? * Example 1: Consider a salaried individual with a gross taxable income of Rs 5.5 lakh, eligible for a standard deduction of Rs 50,000, 80C deduction of Rs 1.5 lakh, and other deductions totaling Rs 1,10,000, you need to file ITR.* Example 2: If your net taxable income is Rs 4.25 lakh, which is below the Rs 5 lakh or Rs 7 lakh threshold (depending on the tax regime ), you are exempt from paying income tax due to the rebate under section 87A. However, you must still file an ITR because your gross total income exceeds Rs 2.5 lakh (old tax regime) or Rs 3 lakh (new tax regime).* Example 3: As a salaried individual with a gross taxable income of Rs 7.5 lakh and a standard deduction of Rs 50,000, you may not owe any income tax after deductions and rebates. Nevertheless, filing an ITR is still mandatory.Agarwala states, ""Individuals are mandatorily required to file an income tax return if their total income, excluding deductions under Chapter VI-A, exceeds the basic exemption limit. In this case, the total income excluding gross deductions under section 80C will be Rs 3,90,000 (Rs 5.5 lakh-Rs 50,000-Rs 1.1 lakh) (assuming the other deductions are not under Chapter VI-A), and they will be mandatorily required to file their ITR.""Also Read | Form 26 AS: Filing Income Tax Return? Know why Form 26AS is important & how to download it If you are obligated to file an ITR but fail to do so by the deadline of July 31, 2024, you have the option to file a belated ITR. However, if you choose not to file at all, you may face several consequences, says Agarwala.Firstly, under Section 234A, if you don't pay your taxes on time, you will be subject to penal interest at a rate of 1% per month on the outstanding tax amount. Additionally, if there is a delay in the payment of advance tax, interest will be levied under Section 234B.Moreover, according to Section 234F, failing to file your ITR within the due date will result in a late fee of Rs 5,000. However, if your annual income is below Rs 5 lakhs, the late fee will be limited to Rs 1,000. If your gross income falls below the basic exemption limit, no penalty will be charged.It's important to note that when filing a belated ITR, you forfeit the ability to carry forward losses from stocks, future and options (F&O), and other sources. However, you can still carry forward losses from house property.Furthermore, filing an ITR is a prerequisite for receiving any tax refund. If you file a belated ITR, you will not be entitled to any interest on the tax refund.In the event that you don't file an ITR, the income tax assessing officer has the authority to conduct a Best Judgment Assessment. This means that the tax officer may estimate your income and tax liability based on the information available to them.Lastly, if you fail to file your ITR and do not opt for the old tax regime by submitting Form 10-IEA, your income tax will be calculated under the new tax regime by default. As a result, you may miss out on claiming gross deductions that would have been applicable to you.","Filing an income tax return (ITR) is compulsory if your gross taxable income surpasses the basic exemption limit. However, this does not always imply that you are required to pay income tax. The deadline for filing ITR for the current assessment year is July 31, 2024.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111366911,imgsize-47020,width-400,resizemode-4/111366911.jpg"

But while they managed to stay positive, Tata Motors , which had made a remarkable comeback over the last few years, witnessed an 8% decline in dealer deliveries. Mahindra and Toyota, however, had good dispatches, but perhaps more due to pending consumer delivery backlog.Shailesh Chandra, MD of Tata Motors' passenger vehicles and electric mobility divisions, said after a boost in demand in the first half of April due to festivities in some parts of country, the industry has seen a decline in retails (registrations) in May and June due to elections and heatwave.This has seen the company ""re-adjust"" wholesales to keep channel inventory under control.

He also owns a $21 billion stake in waste-management company Republic Services Inc. through Cascade.Gates, 68, has been slowly reducing his fortune through philanthropy.

French Gates recently stepped down as co-chair of the foundation and received $12.5 billion to use for her own charitable purposes.In 2010, Gates, French Gates and Buffett also founded the Giving Pledge, an organization that encourages the world’s richest people to give away the majority of their fortunes in their lifetimes or their wills.

"Bond yields are falling, life insurers may raise rates",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/bond-yields-are-falling-life-insurers-may-raise-rates/articleshow/111413629.cms,"MUMBAI: The fall in long-term bond yields , coupled with pressure from reinsurers, is causing private insurers to reevaluate their term insurance rates . Three of the top five private life companies are expected to raise their term rates soon, a senior industry source said.The yield on the 40-year bond has decreased from 7.34% at the time of issue last year to 7.09%.Similarly, the yields on other long-term bonds have also dropped. For example, the 27-year bond maturing in 2051 is trading at a yield of 7.06% - only marginally higher than 10-year bond yield of 7%. These long-term bonds were already highly sought-after, with demand from insurance companies surpassing supply.However, the entrance of new foreign investors in the bond market following JP Morgan index's inclusion of govt bonds has further pushed down yields. And if RBI cuts rates later this year to keep pace with the US Fed, as expected by some economists, bond yields could fall further.As part of their balance sheet management, insurers have to set aside a certain amount for claims they expect to pay over the next four decades, from the policies they have issued today. If bond yields fall, the amount that insurers must set aside goes up. The other factor is that the reinsurance market continues to be hard.

Budget 2024 income tax expectations : Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is expected to present the first full Union Budget 2024 of the Modi 3.0 government in July. Like every year, salaried individuals are looking at FM Sitharaman to provide tax relief in the form of reduced tax rates, changed income tax slabs and even higher deductions.One such relief that is sought is to include more non-metro cities in the 50% House Rent Allowance (HRA) exemption list.HRA is a common component of employee compensation packages provided by many employers.Employees receiving HRA and paying rent for their accommodation can claim a tax exemption on the allowance under the old income tax regime. The exemption amount depends on whether the employee resides in a metro city or not for tax purposes. However, if an employee receiving HRA does not live in a rented house, the entire allowance becomes fully taxable.According to an ET report quoting Radhika Viswanathan, Executive Director at Deloitte Haskins & Sells LLP, the Income-tax Act, 1961, under Section 10(13A), provides tax exemption for HRA. The amount of HRA that can be claimed as tax exempt is the lowest of the following:1. Actual HRA received;2. Actual Rent paid minus 10% of basic salary;3. 50% of basic salary (for metro cities)/40% of basic salary (for non-metro cities).Also Read | Budget 2024 income tax expectations: Modi government may lower personal tax rates, says report - top 5 points Currently, rented houses in Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, and Chennai are eligible for a 50% exemption from HRA, while those in other locations fall under the 40% category. It is important to note that this classification was established over three decades ago, according to Viswanathan.As cities have expanded in terms of population and economic growth, it has become necessary to re-evaluate the way we define metro and non-metro cities.Interestingly, the Constitution (seventy-fourth Amendment) Act, 1992, also recognizes the National Capital Region (NCR), Bangalore, Pune, Hyderabad as metro cities. Despite this, the HRA tax exemption for salaried individuals in these cities remains at 40% due to outdated tax laws.Also Read | Standard deduction may rise under new tax regime Residing outside of metro cities can result in a higher proportion of one's income being paid in taxes. For instance, an individual living in Bengaluru may have to pay a higher average rent compared to someone residing in Kolkata or Chennai, which are classified as metro cities for tax purposes.Those living in rapidly developing non-metro cities, as defined by the Income-tax Act, may pay higher rents due to rapid urbanization. But, they receive lower tax benefits for house rent compared to metro cities. With an increasing number of people relocating to these non-metro cities for employment, it is crucial for the government to reassess the regulations for claiming rent exemptions to alleviate the financial strain on taxpayers, feel experts.",Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is expected to present the first full Union Budget 2024 of the Modi 3.0 government in July.

The sources told Reuters that a reduction in personal tax could boost consumption and increase savings for the middle class. The first source mentioned that individuals earning over Rs 15 lakh ($17,960.42) annually, up to a certain undetermined amount, may receive some tax relief.

The changes could be made to the new income tax regime introduced in 2020, where annual income up to Rs 15 lakh is taxed at rates between 5% and 20%, while earnings over Rs 15 lakh are taxed at 30%.

The second source pointed out that the personal tax rate increases six-fold when an individual's income rises from Rs 300,000 to Rs 15 lakh, which they described as ""quite steep.""

The government may also consider lowering personal tax rates for annual incomes of Rs 10 lakh, according to the first source. They added that a new threshold is being discussed for income taxed at the highest rate of 30% under the old tax system.

The second source noted that any loss of tax income to the government through tax cuts could be partially offset by increased consumption from this category of income earners.

The finance minister set the stage for a ""Viksit Bharat by 2047"", on the core principles of ‘Sabka Saath’, ‘Sabka Vikas’, ‘Sabka Vishwas’, with ‘Sabka Prayas’ being added as a new theme in the interim Budget.This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data i.e., farmer welfare and N for Nari utthan i.e., support for women entrepreneurs. These form the pillars of a comprehensive inclusive development. The Government's commitment to sustainable development under the strategy for Amrit Kaal includes achieving 'Net Zero' by 2070, rooftop solarization for one crore households and robust health initiatives.The Indian economy's resilience takes center stage amidst positive indicators of declining current account deficit as a percentage of GDP, falling unemployment rates, and a notable rise in digital transactions. These statistics affirm the robustness of the economy, showcasing a trajectory of growth and stability.The achievements in taxation reforms are nothing short of remarkable, with direct tax collections more than trebling in the last decade, the number of tax return filers increasing by 2.4 times, average processing time of tax returns plummeting from 93 days in FY 2013-14 to an impressive 10 days in FY 2023-24, resulting in issuance of quick refunds. These are the results of consistent progressive measures thus obviating the need for, and rightly avoiding, any last-minute populist measures.No change in existing tax rates, both for direct and indirect taxes, is a good indicator of stability and predictability for investors and taxpayers.A welcome move to waive outstanding tax demands that are minor, disputed, and unreconciled. This involves the withdrawal of outstanding direct tax demands up to Rs. 25,000 pertaining to the period up to FY 2009-10 and up to Rs.10,000 for FY 2010-11 to 2014-15.The Government's commitment to fostering a business-friendly environment is evident in its intent to extend specific tax benefits for start-ups, investments by sovereign wealth funds/ pension funds, and certain IFSC units. The extension has been made now until March 31, 2025. This might help in creating a conducive landscape for business.To align with the CBDT notification issued earlier, the provisions relating to tax collection at source concerning remittances under the Liberalized Remittance Scheme have now been formally incorporated in the Finance Bill, 2024, setting the rate at 20% for amounts exceeding Rs. 7 lakhs in a financial year.The Finance Bill, 2024 proposes an extension of the time limit for introducing the faceless scheme by the Central Government for transfer pricing proceedings, DRP Proceedings, and ITAT Proceedings, up to March 31, 2025.The interim Budget 2024 may not have proposed significant tax announcements, but it very well positioned the prelude to the full budget post the upcoming elections. Considering the potential impact on the population across the four pillars of GYAN, a sizable portion of India stands to be covered. The interim Budget’s focus on the tax front resembles a report card, highlighting the maturity achieved by our tax system. The enhancement of taxpayer services was emphasized as a key priority.","This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data and N for Nari utthan.

The Finance Minister on February 01, 2024, delivered a truly innovative interim budget. At first glance, it did not seem like an interim budget but looked more like the budget to drive further growth and a continuum of inclusive growth-oriented investments.At the outset, this budget brings a wonderful balance between fiscal prudence and continued investment for growth.It's not easy to continue the glide path of reducing the fiscal deficit and continuing to make significant investments in all areas including infrastructure, R&D, energy transition, technology, skilling, and social welfare. The surprising reduction in fiscal deficit of 5.8% as against the budgeted 5.9% for FY24 and the projection of 5.1% in FY25 with a clear focus on increasing investments was a huge positive.This was a budget for everyone and all because it caters to every part of the Indian economy and society. The FM has carefully catered to the investment needs of various sectors. The continued focus on youth, impoverished, women and farmers to increase their involvement and contribution to economic growth is evident. By committing an 11.1% increase in capital expenditure to 11,11,111 lakh crore, the FM has clearly brought every single 1 in this growth journey.What was very impressive was the inclusion strategy of the government. The focus on women's empowerment for the past few years is unprecedented, which is reflected in the inclusion of women in the workforce moving from 23.3% to 37% in the last five years. The thirty crore Mudra Yojna loans to women entrepreneurs were a great boost to the Nari Shakti initiative. We already have over 10 million Lakhpati Didis and what is truly evident is like a corporate CFO, the FM has revised the earlier target of 20 million Lakhpati Didis to 30 million. The government also plans to invest in initiatives to encourage young girls between the ages of 9 and 14 to undertake the vaccination for cervical cancer which is again a great boost to Nari Shakti.A lot needs to be done to bring more women into all parts of economic growth but the journey so far and the vision of the future is truly inspiring.While India continues on its technological prowess and makes its mark in new technologies like Artificial Intelligence, we need a multi-pronged strategy to harness the power of AI. We need a clear focus on building AI systems in India so that we not only emerge as a global leader in this new era but can build models, which are specific to India that will benefit Indians. At the same time, we need a very wide coverage program to build skills to leverage AI to its fullest potential. The biggest contribution we can make to the inclusion of youth in the economic development of the country is by skilling them in new skill areas. In the last few years, the Skill India Mission has trained 14 million youth, reskilled over 5 million youth and established a staggering 3,000 new ITIs. The future of any country will depend as much on capital investments as on skill investments.The focus on agricultural development and support to the farmer continues through direct financial assistance to farmers. The farmers have benefited by getting crop insurance through PM Fasal Bima Yojana. It's not just the farmers, the PM-SVANidhi provides credit assistance to a large number of street vendors.The last few years have seen the journey of affordable housing through Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY). There is a slight increase in allocation to launch a scheme for encouraging the middle class to build or buy new homes. This investment will likely propel a wider economic development and increase employment.India has seen a tremendous rise in entrepreneurship in the last few years. In order to continue the journey and promote new startups, the government proposes to extend certain tax benefits, which are expiring from March 2024 to March 2025. The MSMEs have not been left behind. With a proposal to provide timely finances to such enterprises, the government has paved the way for their growth, so they can look to compete globally.All in all, it’s a truly inclusive budget with a clear focus on development not just by giving away freebies but enabling the people to participate in the economic development activity. While the FM calls the comprehensive GDP - Governance, Development & Performance – to me, this budget is inclusive of another GDP – gender, demography, and professions.","Akhilesh Tuteja is Partner and Head, Clients and Markets, KPMG in India.

‘Enough domestic sources of demand to counter drag from external sector’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/enough-domestic-sources-of-demand-to-counter-drag-from-external-sector/articleshow/107372012.cms,"Do you think the

creates room for lower interest rates?

One of the issues that the Budget has flagged is the demographic challenge and opportunity and the societal change that is taking place. How do you view this?

Niti Aayog is working on the Viksit Bharat roadmap. What will be the focus areas?

You are as much a representative of the Centre as well as the states. Is it time to revisit the entire formula for transfers to states particularly on the issue of cesses and surcharges?

Suman Bery , who heads Niti Aayog , the govt think tank, is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China, which he says is also an opportunity for India. The economist is confident that Indian states remain resilient. Excerpts of the interview with TOI.The finance ministry expects the economy to grow 7% next year.Given the global situation, how do you see the prospects?The belief in the finance ministry is that we have a possible drag coming from the external sector but that we have other sources. We have enough domestic sources of demand. One has to applaud the political and economic judgment of FM in deciding that it was appropriate to pursue the path of fiscal consolidation. There is transparency. What this actually reflects is responsible economic management, which is one reason we are where we are. Second, it also creates a buffer so that there is policy space if we do encounter headwinds.That’s the hope and expectation. We have an independent central bank and an inflation targeting central bank, so it is up to the monetary policy committee to take a call through the monetary policy committee on the repo rate .The PM has said that when India grows its states grow. India is a composite of 37 states and UTs. They are each at very different points in their demographic transition. There are some states where the net replacement rate is down to 1%, like Kerala . There are others, particularly UP and Bihar, which are in their earliest stage of demographic transition and each one of these states is the size of a large European country. There are two implications of that — one is internal labour mobility and it will become an even larger part of our growth model. The govt has taken several steps to create a unified market. Our main endowment is our human capital and that has to be equipped to participate in global exchange in many ways. We know from China, Japan that the demographic dividend partly depends on markets and on human capital. But the golden period is fairly short lived, about 15 years, when the so called dependency ratio declines. The other big opportunity the PM has been highlighting is bringing women much more into the active labour force.When Niti was set up there was the idea of a three-year vision and a seven-year strategy paper. The reality is that schemes of govt tend to be aligned with the award of the Finance Commission . There are various established building blocks or hand holds which are already a matter of govt policy. The PM is much more interested in a national debate on what it means to be a Viksit Bharat or modern society. We have a collective goal and it is for the democratic polity to define what that goal should be. Its emphatically not for a super mandarin bureaucracy. It is not going to be Lee Kwan Yew’s Singapore led from the top.It’s entirely a finance ministry matter but I would be lying if I didn’t say when I visit certain states there is this complaint. A big frontier would be resource mobilisation at the state level. Second is going to be rationalisation of subsidies not only at the Union level, but also at the state level. All chief ministers sit on my governing council. When they convene as the governing council, I see them in their role as development practitioners. The world is beginning to appreciate quite how much institutional and political maturity India attained in our 75 years and the most fundamental dimension of a democracy, we have orderly transfers of power. There are enough buffers to ensure that what happens in state finances is unlikely to create macro instability. Those risks are well contained by our Constitution. The chief ministers know that they are going to be judged by development outcomes and so you can have the sugar rush of changing of pension plans or various handouts but if the cupboard is bare you are not going to be able to deliver.","Suman Bery is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China.

Government's Marathon to 2047: Emphasis on Fiscal Prudence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/governments-marathon-to-2047-emphasis-on-fiscal-prudence/articleshow/107371788.cms,"What was the thinking behind keeping the vote on account absolutely straight?

So is it the idea to keep the Budget completely transparent?

The capex has risen 11.1% and there is an emphasis on infrastructure spending. But there is also the hope that the private sector will now take over and start capital spending. Given the geopolitical situation, how confident is the govt that it will pan out as planned?

Finance secretary T V Somanathan, in an interview with TOI, says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047 . Excerpts:If you see the Budget speech you will see the emphasis on 2047. The govt has set its sight on running that marathon.Running to 2047 is a marathon , it’s not a sprint. If you are going to run a marathon, you need to be in good shape and you can’t have short-term stimulants or something that will get you some yards and then it’s done.The whole focus is on making India a developed country by 2047, for which a healthy present and a strong fiscal position is an important concomitant. Some purely short term measures don’t really fit into that picture. It’s a consistent picture: focus on the long term for which you need to build strength in the short term and that needs to be done by prudence in fiscal policy and by not doing things which can detract you from that path. Not doing the wrong thing is more important than appearing to do things.The idea is that govt finances may be good, bad or indifferent depending on the times, depending on the circumstances, depending on the policies. But what is the position should be reflected as reasonably and accurately as possible. That is an emphasis. As regards the Finance Commission, again the terms of reference that have been given to them are the terms in the Constitution.What is the means by which the devolution should be done is a matter they have full discretion. They can actually take all kinds of factors into account and in a sense we felt this time based on my review of the previous commissions that the right expression would be less is more. The shorter, less prescriptive terms of reference gives full scope for all stakeholders including state govts to express their viewpoints and for the commission to take a balanced view of the different perspectives and then come to its award. Ultimately the award of the Finance Commission is about devolution and grant for which full scope has now been given to them.n There are incipient signs of private capital expenditure accelerating. There are some surveys I have seen done by some of the chambers industry, which show high levels of investment. The PMI, which is a sort of leading indicator, is also looking pretty healthy. Capacity utilisation is one reason that private sector capital expenditure doesn’t immediately pick up when the economy starts accelerating because there is surplus capacity.But increasingly I get the sense that many industries are beginning to reach levels where they have to add capacity. When that happens capital investment will happen. Another pointer also mentioned in the Budget speech you may notice that our airlines have placed large orders for planes — that is capital expenditure.When you import 1,000 aircraft, it’s just not 1,000 aircraft, there are concomitant additions to ground handling facilities, you need airports to expand, you need to employ people to do that. That means a lot of jobs. The aircraft is capital but then look at the effect it is going to have on skilled jobs. So capital expenditure is happening. I am fairly confident that we will have decent capital expenditure in the year to come and that will become a new source of acceleration.",Finance secretary T V Somanathan says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047. The capex has risen 11.1% and there is an emphasis on infrastructure spending.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-107371891,imgsize-720422,width-400,resizemode-4/107371891.jpg"
Jayachandran Ramachandran: Claude 3.5 Sonnet sets new coding benchmarks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/times-techies/claude-3-5-sonnet-sets-new-coding-benchmarks/articleshow/111329656.cms,"Anthropic’s latest AI model , Claude 3.5 Sonnet , arrived seemingly out of nowhere last week, free to use for everyone, and is now setting new benchmarks in a number of metrics. Most notably, it aced the leader boards in key categories of the LMSYS Chatbot Arena , a benchmark used to measure large language model performance. Specifically, it secured the top position in the ‘Coding Arena’ and ‘Hard Prompts’ categories, beating industry behemoths like GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro , all while being a lighter, faster model to run.Jayachandran Ramachandran , senior VP of Artificial Intelligence Labs for C5i, says the LMSYS Chatbot Arena is a crowdsourced open benchmarking platform and that users perform various tasks in pair wise comparison of models and provide feedback on which models can satisfactorily provide the best response. “The ranking system is quite transparent, robust, and reliable. In recent times, the top position was occupied by frontier models such as GPT-4 series and Gemini-1.5 series. It is a significant development for Claude 3.5 Sonnet to outsmart other leading frontier models and occupy the top position, especially in coding tasks,” he says.Saurav Swaroop , co-founder & CTO of financing platform Velocity, which recently launched Vani AI , a GenAIled customer calling solution for financial institutions, says that while GPT-4 has been assisting developers with writing code for some time now, it has been prone to errors and hallucinations. “However, Claude can write production level deployable code now. This will boost developer productivity and the time to build software will keep coming down,” he says.With its advanced reasoning skills, it’s great at handling multi-step workflows too, which is essential for complex projects, says Sourabh Kumar, senior manager of experience engineering for Publicis Sapient. “Compared to other industry leaders like GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet offers faster processing speeds and higher accuracy in complex coding and reasoning tasks. For industries such as finance, where accurate data analysis is critical, or retail, where trend prediction can drive success, integrating Claude 3.5 Sonnet can lead to significant efficiency gains and innovation,” he says.Claude 3.5 Sonnet can also offer alternative solutions that coders might not have even considered, says Bebi Negi, senior lead data scientist at the Analytics Centre of Excellence for Happiest Minds Technologies.However, Bebi says coders will still need to check the code created by the model. “While it can create code quickly, it is very important to understand the code and make sure it meets a project’s requirements and standards. Even though benchmarks rate the model at around 90%, the remaining 10% gap underscores the necessity for coders to review the outputs,” she says.Securing the top spot in the Hard Prompts category was also a big deal, says Bebi. “The Hard Prompts category was all about handling complex tasks and instructions. The model did a great job here too, showing it can understand and generate high-quality content, even when the instructions are quite tricky.”","Anthropic’s latest AI model, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, is now free to use for everyone.

GenAI: On-device AI is cheaper and faster than cloud,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/times-techies/on-device-ai-is-cheaper-and-faster-than-cloud/articleshow/111329501.cms,"As devices such as smartphones , laptops, tablets and cars become more intelligent and powerful with increased processing capabilities and sensors, the tech industry is focusing on harnessing the power of AI on the edge or on-device AI to come up with more context-aware personalised user experiences.And while AI may have started off as something very specific to image processing, it has over the past four to five years evolved and exploded, especially with GenAI coming into play, to include a lot more use cases around text processing, voice processing and multimodal use cases, said Rajesh Narayanan, vice president of engineering at Qualcomm .He was speaking on ₹AI on the Edge’ at the first edition of the ‘TechForward’ research seminar series launched by Indian Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad (IIITH). The series seeks to spark regular and deep academia-industry conversations around emerging technologies.Narayanan pointed out that on-device AI has evolved to offer advantages such as personalisation , privacy and security, and with lower energy consumption and costs, and better performance compared to AI on the cloud.“Today, smartphones, smartwatches, devices that are a part of home automation, devices in the car and industrial IoT are equipped with plenty of cameras and sensors and are becoming a lot more powerful with the ability to collect more data. They also have more processing capacities, leading to more context aware user experience that can lead to a much better day-to-day life for all of us,” he said.He said that for all this to become a reality, you need a very powerful AI engine, and the overall solution has to be extremely power efficient.Personalisation is a key selling point for on-device AI as all the data that was earlier being sent to the cloud, potentially compromising privacy and security, can be done on the device. On-device AI also brings down energy consumption significantly compared to running workloads on a much bigger infrastructure like the cloud.Performance too improves as processing on the device itself can enable low latency as opposed to sending the query to the cloud, as with devices like Alexa.Narayanan said on-device AI is also a lot more affordable compared to the cloud. “As we transition from traditional AI to GenAI, the cost per query is actually going up and cloud economics isn’t going to work as compared to doing it on the device,” he said.In his talk on Vision on the AI edge’, Anoop Namboodiri , who heads the Biometrics and Secure Identity Lab and is associated with the Centre for Visual Information Technology at IIITH, said computer vision is playing a key role in pushing AI, and now GenAI.","The tech industry is focusing on harnessing the power of AI on the edge or on- device AI to come up with more context-aware personalised user experiences.

Service bots get our lingo,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/times-techies/service-bots-get-our-lingo/articleshow/111329125.cms,"Moving to complex functions

Indic language capability

is a little expensive now

The other day I decided to check out an airline’s chatbot to see how it works. I keyed in: “I’m travelling with my 8-year-old son, recommend the best flight without disturbing his sleep”. It asked for my source and destination, which I gave as Chennai and Hyderabad. It asked for the date. I typed ₹Mon’ (for Monday), but it did not recognise what I meant.I typed ₹tom’, it correctly recognised it as tomorrow.The bot responded that there were no flights that “fully meet” my specified criteria and provided a bunch of options. I then asked for the cheapest flight, and non-stop flights. The options it provided were correct – I confirmed that on MakeMyTrip and Google Flights. It automatically filled the passenger list as 1 adult and 1 child for booking. It even clarified the availability of gluten free food for my fictional son.Customer support bots have come a long way from the days of clunky bots that only answered FAQs. These sophisticated generative AI-based tools are much better than their predecessors, though still far from perfect. Sometimes they ask silly questions even after being explicitly told. They struggle to recognise colloquial words, have woefully poor memory, unlike human agents. But at least you don’t have to listen to hold music for 15 minutes.The leap comes from GenAI ’s ability to understand conversations better, their ability to understand multilingual queries , and support for interfaces like voice and videos. As these systems improve, customer support will become a lot quicker and easier for users, and hugely cheaper for companies, since they won’t have to hire thousands of contact centre staff.Ramprakash Ramamoorthy, director of AI Research at Zoho Corp, says with GenAI, the next goal is to make customer assistant bots do more complex and autonomous functions. He says they could hand over the issue to human agents when it figures it can’t handle it. He says they may even be able to process warranty claims, for instance. “As soon as you reach out, the system will be able to cross-check the database for similar issues/ queries where warranty claims are applicable. A human agent will have to call a supervisor to do the same job,” he says.But these are still some time away. Even for basic customer support services, companies are being careful due to concerns around data privacy, and hallucination. Nobody, after all, wants to get into a situation like Air Canada did earlier this year when its chatbot offered a discount to a customer that it wasn’t supposed to.Chaitanya Chokkareddy, cofounder of Ozonetel, the Hyderabadbased customer experience tech provider, says the focus currently is on automating the most common, repetitive queries. Chatbots, he says, fail in non-common areas of work.He says a lot of work is happening with AI in the back-end like data analysis, summary, intent analysis, and quality control, focusing on efficiency and productivity of human customer agents and improving margins of companies. “We handle about 20 million calls per day which last about 3 to 5 minutes each, and a lot of that data is currently not accessible to managers to make better decisions on their product and services. Demand for back-end services is higher than customer facing applications,” he says.While AI assistants perform relatively well in English, their performance in Indic languages is not great. Ozonetel is building Telugu language tokenisation by working with a non-profit and 1 lakh student interns to build a Telugu database. But Indian languages, he says, cost around 5x to 10x more compared to English because of the complex tokenisation of Indian languages compared to the Roman alphabet. “AI models are charged based on usage and chatbots using Indic scripts have more tokens and hence have higher computational costs. In many cases, the costs are equivalent to a human being and so our customers don’t want to automate,” Chaitanya says.Ankush Sabharwal’s CoRover.ai also has a local language model called BharatGPT. The bot can respond to voice queries in Indian languages, and provide tailored information. It also has video chatbots with pre-generated videos and text-to-video conversion and lip sync, which can be used for purposes like internal training.Ankush says redundant workload should be automated first, and as the adoption increases, more clear use cases will emerge. He says problems like hallucination can be reduced with retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and use of domain-specific small models.Abhiroop Medhekar, founder & CEO of financing platform Velocity, says they have built text-to-speech and speech-to-text tech for AI-agent voice call automation. They initially used it internally and then started commercial offerings. “Some BFSI applications require an immediate response from customers, but customers frequently don’t respond to mails or WhatsApp reminders. The current robotic IVR calls are not effective either. But these GenAI-based voice calls are interactive and provide better results,” he says.","Chatbots have come a long way from the days of clunky bots that only answered FAQs.

It was a cloudburst phenomenon with the maximum rain concentrated around the Safdarjung station,"" IMD chief Mrutyunjay Mohapatra told TOI.The normal rainfall for the month of June at Safdarjung is 80.6mm. In a single hour, the month's normal was exceeded by 25%. The day's rainfall, at 228.5mm, was nearly four times the June normal.So, what caused such extreme rainfall, the highest single-day spell at Safdarjung since 1996 and the highest in June since 1936? ""At that time, two circulations, one over Haryana and another over south Rajasthan-Gujarat, were bringing some moisture from the Arabian Sea. At the same time, there was a low-pressure system over Bay of Bengal near the Odisha coast that was energising the southwest monsoon and pushing these winds towards northwest India. The circulations in the north also attracted the monsoon towards the region, leading to its swift movement towards Delhi-NCR,"" Mohapatra said.He said the final piece in the mix was a high-pressure system in the upper layers of atmosphere over Delhi that caused convergence of winds in the lower layers, leading to perfect conditions for intense thunderstorms. ""It was a multiple-scale interaction which caused extreme rainfall over a very narrow region. In technical terms, it was a mesoscale convection system,"" the IMD chief said.While Friday's conditions differed significantly from previous instances, it was nonetheless the third multi-system convergence causing heavy rain in the capital in less than two years. The previous instances were in July last year and Oct 2022.These weather interactions have become a prime cause of extreme rainfall in north India in recent years, including the catastrophic Kedarnath deluge of 2013. And climate change could be adding to their destructive potential. ""We can be fairly certain that these interactions, when they do happen, will be increasingly linked with extreme rainfall and flooding,"" said meteorologist Kieran Hunt from the UK's University of Reading, who has been researching on two-system interactions over India.","The normal rainfall for the month of June at Safdarjung is 80.6mm.

"Under pressure on plane safety, Boeing is buying stressed supplier Spirit for $4.7 billion",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/under-pressure-on-plane-safety-boeing-is-buying-stressed-supplier-spirit-for-4-7-billion/articleshow/111403727.cms,"Boeing announced plans to acquire key supplier Spirit AeroSystems for $4.7 billion, a move that it says will improve plane quality and safety amid increasing scrutiny by Congress, airlines and the Department of Justice.Boeing previously owned Spirit, and the purchase would reverse a longtime Boeing strategy of outsourcing key work on its passenger planes.That approach has been criticized as problems at Spirit disrupted production and delivery of popular Boeing jetliners including 737s and 787s.""We believe this deal is in the best interest of the flying public, our airline customers, the employees of Spirit and Boeing, our shareholders and the country more broadly,"" Boeing President and CEO Dave Calhoun said in a statement late Sunday.Concerns about safety came to a head after the Jan. 5 blowout of a panel on an Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9 at 16,000 feet (4,876 meters) over Oregon. The Federal Aviation Administration soon after announced increased oversight of Boeing and Spirit, which supplied the fuselage for the plane.No one was seriously injured in the Alaska Airlines door incident, which terrified passengers, but Boeing is under pressure from the US Justice Department to plead guilty to criminal fraud in connection with two deadly plane crashes involving its 737 Max jetliners more than five years ago.Boeing has until the end of the week to accept or reject the offer, which includes the giant aerospace company agreeing to an independent monitor who would oversee its compliance with anti-fraud laws, according to several people who heard federal prosecutors detail a proposed offer Sunday.The Justice Department said in a May court filing that Boeing violated terms of a 2021 settlement allowing the company to avoid prosecution for actions leading up to the crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia, which killed 346 people.Those crashes were blamed on a faulty sensor in a flight-control system and the investigation is separate from the probe of the more recent Alaska Airlines blowout, which involved Spirit.Boeing spun off Spirit, which is based in Wichita, Kansas, and not related to Spirit Airlines, in 2005. In recent years, quality problems have mounted, including fuselage panels that didn't fit together precisely enough and holes that were improperly drilled.Spirit removed its CEO in October and replaced him with Patrick Shanahan, a former Boeing executive who served as acting defense secretary in the Trump administration.Things seemed to be going more smoothly until the Alaska Airlines incident. Investigators said a panel used in place of an extra emergency door had been removed at a Boeing factory to let Spirit workers fix damaged rivets, and bolts that help hold the panel in place were missing after the repair job. It is not clear who removed the bolts and failed to put them back.Spirit said in May that it was laying off about 450 workers at its Wichita plant because of a production slowdown since the January incident. Its total workforce was just over 13,000 people.""Bringing Spirit and Boeing together will enable greater integration of both companies' manufacturing and engineering capabilities, including safety and quality systems,"" Shanahan said.The acquisition 's equity value of $4.7 billion is $37.25 per share, while the total value of the deal is around $8.3 billion, which includes Spirit's last reported net debt, the aerospace company said.Boeing common stock will be exchanged for Spirit shares according to a variable formula that depends on a weighted average of the share price over a 15-trading-day period ending on the second day before the deal closes, Boeing said.The companies also announced an agreement with Airbus to negotiate the purchase of Spirit assets involved with programs operated by the European aerospace firm. The Airbus agreement is set to commence when Boeing's acquisition of Spirit is completed, the two US companies said.",Boeing announced plans to acquire key supplier Spirit AeroSystems for $4.7 billion.

Turbulence in WaPo as daily loses dollars,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/turbulence-in-wapo-as-daily-loses-dollars/articleshow/111370032.cms,"The prestigious Washington Post is in crisis, with pressure on from owner Jeff Bezos to change its money-losing ways. The Post's managing editor abruptly resigned; a chosen successor withdrew under fire, and a boss has been targeted in the newspaper's columns.At the heart of the storm is the ""WaPo""'s new CEO, Briton William Lewis , who was given a mission by Amazon founder Bezos when he appointed him last autumn.Lewis was asked to turn around a newspaper that continues to pile up Pulitzer Prizes half a century after the Watergate scandal it instigated, but which has lost $77 million in 2023 despite job cuts and the disappearance of its Sunday supplement. However, the former journalist, who made history in the 2000s with a scoop on the expenses of British MPs when he was editor of the Daily Telegraph, is finding his position increasingly vulnerable.For weeks now, revelations have multiplied about his role, when he was working for the Murdoch family's conservative media group about 12 years ago, in a scandal of illegal phone tapping by the tabloid The News of the World. On Friday, Lewis was at the centre of an investigation by his own journalists. According to the Washington Post, he gave the go-ahead in 2011 for the destruction of thousands of emails, fuelling suspicions that he was destroying evidence, which he denies.As the US presidential election approaches, the affair is poisoning the atmosphere at a long-vaunted newspaper that is ""not doing well economically,"" says Northeastern University journalism professor Dan Kennedy.The Post was among trusted news outlets that benefited from the upheaval that marked Trump's four years in the White House that ended with his loss to President Joe Biden. Trump's departure from the White House meant fewer attention-grabbing stories to keep readers engaged. By the end of 2022, the Post would have 2.5 million subscribers compared with 3 million subscribers when Biden took office in early 2021, according to the Wall Street Journal.Meanwhile, rival New York Times has grown to more than 10 million subscribers, the fruit of a strategy to diversify into fun topics such as games, food, and lifestyle while still serving up hard news.Professor Kennedy believes that Lewis has no choice but to leave the Post because he has lost the confidence of the team there.","The prestigious Washington Post is in crisis, with pressure on from owner Jeff Bezos.

Vedanta told Bloomberg this week that it stands ready to start making the payments. Agarwal’s firm has also committed to investing $1 billion over five years to complete expansion projects.Although Konkola’s annual production capacity exceeds 300,000 tons of copper, output of the metal that’s key to the energy transition and whose price rallied to a record last month slumped to less than 40,000 tons in 2023.The flagship operation — Konkola Deep — extends almost a mile underground.
