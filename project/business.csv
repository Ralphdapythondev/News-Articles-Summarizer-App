"Good news for EPS Pensioners! Now, get pension from any bank, any branch, anywhere in India from January 1, 2025",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/good-news-for-eps-pensioners-now-get-pension-from-any-bank-any-branch-anywhere-in-india-from-january-1-2025/articleshow/113059993.cms,"Good news for EPS pensioners ! The Union Minister of Labour and Employment and Chairperson, Central Board of Trustees, EPF has given the green light to the proposal for a Centralized Pension Payment System (CPPS) for the Employees' Pension Scheme, 1995.This centralized system at the national level will allow pension disbursement through any bank branch across the country, representing a significant change.The facility will be introduced as part of EPFO 's ongoing IT modernization project, Centralized IT Enabled System (CITES 2.01), starting from January 1, 2025. In the subsequent phase, CPPS will facilitate a smooth transition to the Aadhaar-based payment system (ABPS).Commenting on this new step, Union Minister Dr. Mansukh Mandaviya said, ""The approval of the Centralized Pension Payment System (CPPS) marks a significant milestone in modernization of the EPFO. By enabling pensioners to receive their pensions from any bank, any branch, anywhere in the country, this initiative addresses the long-standing challenges faced by pensioners and ensures a seamless and efficient disbursement mechanism. This is a crucial step in our ongoing efforts to transform the EPFO into a more robust, responsive, and tech-enabled organization, committed to serving the needs of its members and pensioners better.""The CPPS is anticipated to benefit over 78 lakh EPS pensioners of EPFO by leveraging advanced IT and banking technologies, providing a more efficient and user-friendly experience for pensioners.The new system will ensure pension disbursement throughout India without the need for transferring Pension Payment Orders (PPO) between offices, even when pensioners relocate or change their bank or branch. This will greatly benefit pensioners who return to their hometowns after retirement.The CPPS represents a significant shift from the current decentralized pension disbursement system, where each Zonal/Regional Office of EPFO maintains separate agreements with only a few banks.Pensioners will no longer need to visit the branch for verification at the commencement of their pension, and the pension will be credited immediately upon release. Moreover, EPFO anticipates a substantial reduction in pension disbursement costs after transitioning to the new system.","Centralized system at the national level will allow pension disbursement through any bank branch across the country. Facility will be introduced as part of EPFO's ongoing IT modernization project, Centralized IT Enabled System (CITES 2.01), starting from January 1, 2025.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113060144,imgsize-92372,width-400,resizemode-4/113060144.jpg"
Delhi-Dehradun expressway status: Travel from Delhi to Dehradun in 2.5 hours soon,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/delhi-dehradun-expressway-status-travel-from-delhi-to-dehradun-in-2-5-hours-soon-details-here/articleshow/113013752.cms,"Delhi-Dehradun Expressway: Top Facts

Once finished, the travel time from Akshardham in Delhi to Dehradun will be reduced to just two and a half hours, compared to the current six hours. Similarly, commuters will be able to reach Haridwar from Delhi in two hours.

The 264-km expressway and the Haridwar link, with a total cost of around Rs 14,285 crore, are fully funded by the government. The project boasts special features, including ""Asia's longest elevated wildlife corridor (12 km) and animal underpass,"" which aim to minimize man-animal conflict in the Rajaji National Park and Shiwalik Reserve forest areas.

NHAI sources have indicated that the first leg of the expressway, stretching from Akshardham to the Eastern Peripheral Expressway (EPE) interchange, is expected to be operational by November this year.

This section passes through areas such as Geeta Colony, Shastri Park, and Sonia Vihar in Delhi, as well as Vijay Vihar, Kasim Vihar, and Mandola in Uttar Pradesh. The opening of this stretch is anticipated to provide relief to many commuters from daily traffic congestion.

The Delhi-EPE access-controlled section, spanning 32 kilometers, includes an impressive 19 kilometers of elevated roadway. This elevated portion is designed to accommodate through traffic, while the six-lane service road below will cater to local traffic needs.

The Delhi-Dehradun expressway will offer seven entry points for vehicles traveling from Delhi to Uttar Pradesh, located at Akshardham, Geeta Colony, Shamshan Ghat (Kailash Nagar), Sonia Vihar, Vijay Vihar, and Mandola. Exits will be provided at Khajuri Chowk, Sonia Vihar, Vijay Vihar, and Mandola.

On the other hand, traffic moving from Uttar Pradesh to Delhi will have entry points at Mandola, Vijay Vihar, and 5th Pusta, with exits available at Mandola, Loni, Vijay Vihar, Usmanpur, Shamshan Ghat (Kailash Nagar), Geeta Colony, and Akshardham. Commuters entering and exiting the expressway within Delhi will be exempt from paying tolls, according to an ET report.

Delhi-Dehradun Expressway status: Come December 2024, you may be able to travel between Delhi and Dehradun in just 2.5 hours! The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) plans to open the New Delhi-Dehradun Expressway for traffic by December. The same has been communicated to Prime Minister Narendra Modi by the road transport ministry officials during a recent meeting.However, the link connecting the expressway to Haridwar only will be ready by May 2025. The Prime Minister instructed the ministry to ensure timely completion of the project without any delays. Sources told TOI recently that all land-related issues have been resolved, and the NHAI has committed to finishing the remaining work on the Delhi-Dehradun expressway within the next four months.The access-controlled link from the expressway to Haridwar was a later addition to the project, and the NHAI will require an additional five months to complete it.","The 264-km Delhi-Dehradun expressway is expected to be completed by December 2024.

India losing to smaller rivals in manufacturing: World Bank,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/india-losing-to-smaller-rivals-in-manufacturing-world-bank/articleshow/113031692.cms,"India’s global trade share hasn’t kept pace with its fast growing economy, and the country is losing out to rivals like Bangladesh and Vietnam as low-cost manufacturing export hubs, the World Bank said.India’s trade in goods and services has been declining as a percentage of gross domestic product over the past decade despite its economic heft, the multilateral lender said in a report on Tuesday.The country’s share in global exports of apparel, leather, textiles, and footwear grew from 0.9% in 2002 to a peak of 4.5% in 2013, but has since declined to 3.5% in 2022, according to the World Bank. In contrast, Bangladesh’s share in global exports of these goods reached 5.1%, while Vietnam’s stood at 5.9% in 2022.To boost exports and benefit from China’s shift away from labor-intensive manufacturing, India will need to lower trade costs, reduce tariff and non-tariff barriers and revise trade pacts, the lender said.“This is an area where India could focus on,” Nora Dihel, a senior economist at the World Bank, told reporters in New Delhi. “This is a call to action.”Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ambition is to make India a manufacturing hub as businesses diversify their supply chains from China. Modi’s government has spent billions of dollars in subsidies to attract investment in industries such as electronics and chip-making.India’s export sectors are increasingly capital intensive, though, and unable to absorb the millions of jobless people in the country. The World Bank estimated that direct employment related to exports fell from a peak of 9.5% of total domestic employment in 2012 to 6.5% in 2020.The World Bank expects India’s economy to continue growing at a rapid pace of 7% in the current fiscal year through March 2025 after expanding more than 8% in the past year. Growth will probably average 6.7% in 2025-26 and 2026-27, the lender said.","India’s trade in goods and services has been declining as a percentage of gross domestic product.

Source: ET quoting Paisabazaar for interest rates data as on August 14, 2024.

Highest Fixed Deposit Interest Rates: Fixed deposits (FDs) offered by banks are secure and interest-generating investment options. With FDs, you can expect a guaranteed return on your invested funds, which remain unaffected by market fluctuations. This is the reason that FDs are a go to investment option for most risk averse investors.Interest rates for fixed deposits are near all time highs, with RBI pausing the rate cycle for several monetary policy meetings now.Investors have the flexibility to choose between the re-investment deposit option, which allows for the accumulation of compound interest, or the option to receive interest payments at regular intervals (monthly/quarterly) to support their financial planning and budgeting needs, notes an ET report.The interest rates offered on fixed deposits in August 2024 can vary based on several factors, including the specific bank, the age of the depositor, the tenure of the deposit, and the amount invested.In India, private banks are financial institutions where private companies or individuals hold the majority of the equity, in contrast to public-sector banks where the government is the primary shareholder.Public Sector Undertaking (PSU) banks are ones where the government owns the majority of the shares. These banks receive government subsidies with the aim of facilitating their growth and expansion.For investors interested in comparing fixed deposit interest rates between private and public sector banks, a brief analysis of the fixed deposit rates offered to both general citizens and senior citizens is provided below.","Public Banks: Latest Fixed Deposit Interest Rates For General Citizens.

The idea is to pick up one or two marquee projects, structure them around building and design standards, which are global in nature and address perceived risks so that the cost of capital is reduced, making the projects attractive to investors to invest. The bridge itself is not about getting into the bidding process. It's about bringing it to a stage where projects are then amenable to international finance,"" said Niti Aayog CEO BVR Subrahmanyam.The move comes as India and the UK negotiate the proposed FTA, which has been in the making for over 15 years, with a review by the new Labour govt delaying a decision. ""On our side, we are ready to move forward as and when our partners are ready,"" High Commissioner of India to the UK Vikram Doraiswami said.Subrahmanyan said: ""The fingers are touching but are not yet at handshaking distance - an extra five inches and you can grab."" He added: ""Institutions are not yet global in India. When you think global, you are open to free trade.""",Eight projects have been identified for support and funding under the UK-India Infrastructure Financing Bridge.

"Residential Property: 'Residential property least affordable in Delhi, Mumbai'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/residential-property-least-affordable-in-delhi-mumbai/articleshow/113074856.cms,"NEW DELHI: Amid the boom in real estate demand and rising prices, Chennai, Ahmedabad and Kolkata have emerged as the most affordable metros for residential investments. Mumbai Metropolitan Region and Delhi are the least affordable, according to a Magicbricks report. While household incomes across the top 10 cities have increased at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.4% between 2020 and 2024, property prices have surged 9.3% (CAGR) in this period, which has weakened affordability.Property price to annual household income ratio (P/I Ratio) in India has increased from 6.6 in 2020 to 7.5 in 2024, higher than the globally accepted benchmarks of 5, the report said.The Mumbai Metropolitan Region (14.3) and Delhi (10.1) emerged as the least affordable, while Chennai, Kolkata and Ahmedabad (5) are among the most affordable cities for residential investments in 2024.Not surprisingly, higher prices have meant greater EMI burden on home buyers. The EMI-to-monthly income ratio in India has risen from 46% in 2020 to 61% in 2024, indicating a rising burden on home buyers and reflecting affordability concerns nationwide, especially metros. The trend is more pronounced in MMR (116%), New Delhi (82%), Gurugram (61%) and Hyderabad (61%). In contrast, cities like Ahmedabad (41%), Chennai (41%) and Kolkata (47%) are relatively more affordable.The report says the current situation is “likely to hit equilibrium conditions with market trends, indicating a deceleration in price growth due to an anticipated increase in residential supply.” Affordability indicates the proportion of property price to annual household income.

Booking an FD without PAN: Implications

When is TDS deducted?

Liability for TDS

Highest Fixed Deposit Interest Rates: A fixed deposit (FD) is a financial instrument that allows individuals to invest a predetermined sum of money for a specific duration. The tenure of the fixed deposit can be chosen by the investor, providing flexibility in investment options.Investors looking to generate additional income through fixed deposits have a wide range of options available.The investment period can span from as short as seven days to as long as 10 years, with the interest rate varying based on the selected tenure.Several top banks offer competitive interest rates on one-year fixed deposits, providing investors with attractive investment opportunities.In the absence of PAN, following are the implications for customers:* TDS will be recovered at 20%(as against 10%)* NO TDS credit from the Income Tax department* NO TDS certificate will be issued (As per CBDT circular no:03/11)* Form 15G/H and other exemption certificates will be invalid and penal TDS will apply.Also Read | FD interest rates set to fall? Why investing in long-term fixed deposits may make sense right now TDS is deducted every time the bank pays/re-invests interest during the financial year. In addition TDS is also deducted on interest accrued(but not yet paid) at the end of financial year viz. 31st March, says ET.If the aggregate interest that you are likely to earn for all your deposits held across branches in a customer ID is greater than Rs 40,000/- (Rs 50,000/- for senior citizens) in a financial year , you become liable for TDS.It is important to note that the tax liability for TDS purposes is determined based on the PAN number and not on a per-branch basis. Even deposits held by minors are subject to TDS, and the credit for the TDS can be claimed by the person in whose hands the minor's income is included.","A fixed deposit is a financial instrument that allows individuals to invest a predetermined sum of money for a specific duration.

Railway Budget 2024 : The government has wavered little in its efforts to spur a modernisation of railways in the country, pivoting on technology, to support the country’s economic ambitions. In line with expectations, Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore, marking yet another year of successive increase in outlay.That takes forward the past policies and the government’s vision, which have paved the way for modernisation of the transport behemoth.In earlier decades, the government had focused on laying tracks on new routes, electrification and incremental rolling stock capacity addition. That was the need of the hour back then and has helped set up the base for a larger transformation.For instance, the massive Dedicated Freight Corridor ( DFC ) as well as locomotive factories at Marhaura and Madhepura in Bihar were conceptualised over a decade ago and we are seeing their completion now.More recently, the focus has shifted to modernisation—of rolling stock and safety systems, among other aspects.This year, emphasis has also been laid on the railways’ crucial role in industrial development. Commodity-specific corridors have been planned in eastern India and impetus given to port connectivity. Vande Bharat and technology-led upgrades in rolling stock remain in focus. Safety has been prioritised through budgetary allocations for the anti-collision systemKavach . That said, there are other cogs in the wheel that demand attention from a long-term perspective.First, the target for the Operating Ratio, the crucial efficiency gauge, has been set at 98.22% for 2024-25, compared with 98.65% in 2023-24. This reflects an imminent need for operational transformation. An effective overhaul of the world’s fourth-largest rail network will take many years and thus we need to start focusing on improving efficiency and reducing costs now.DFC is almost entirely operational and will be complete over the next few months. To ensure the project achieves its twin goals of reducing logistics costs and enhancing freight efficiency, railways need to attract more cargo on the corridor. This will help increase the rail coefficient and make the railways’ approach more market-oriented, which will in turn aid future corridors.A revamp of railway stations is on track, with sufficient funds dedicated to this end. But even though new coaches and wagons are increasingly being added to meet footfalls, the stations and passenger trains themselves remain synonymous with chaos.Just as safety, comfort and convenience have been prioritised, there is a need for solutions to address the capacity and demand challenges. As a first step, the government could target development of new stations and setting up of new coach production units.As a leading freight mover, Indian Railways carried a record 1,588 MT cargo in fiscal 2024, up from 1,095 MT in fiscal 2015. It accounts for 26% of the cargo moved in the country—by no means an easy feat. The railways aims to take this volume to 3,000 MT by 2030, which would require a 11% CAGR against the around 4.2% witnessed over the last 10 years. As per a report by TERI and Shakti Foundation, from carrying about 62% of freight traffic in 1990-91, Indian Railways’ share has declined to ~27% in 2014-15. This has been due to the expanding road network, cost competitiveness over railways, and door-to-door service. Thus, commencing the cycle of increasing the rail share again is commendable.DFCs, a high-capacity track network, high-power locomotives and improvement in wagon designs have set the ball rolling for larger capacity, faster freight trains that deliver better efficiency.Yet, achieving exponential growth is a tall ask given the current dynamics. Possibly, similar challenges might apply to other goals the railways might have for 2047.To be fair, despite its scale and complexity, Indian Railways has been able to achieve diverse developments at commendable speed.But the track ahead is long and it is time to start discussing the reinvention of the institutional set-up.Indian Railways sees substantial private sector involvement in the form of vendors and contractors. Policymakers could start mulling extreme options such as parallel privately-owned and operated railway infrastructure, coupled with centralised planning and an evolved role for the railways. This will need a robust policy framework from the Government of India.The time is perhaps also ripe to bring user charge and asset monetisation-driven segments for passengers as well as cargo to the discussion table. Globally, the separation of infrastructure and operations in railways has delivered mixed results, for example in the United Kingdom. The model should be analysed and revisited to understand its potential relevance in the Indian context.The key would be to retrace our steps and align our long-term goals to identify not just incremental changes but also ways to explore bold and path-breaking alternatives that put Indian Railways on a smooth track and bring it up to speed.","Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore.

Budget 2024 capital gains tax changes: The Narendra Modi government is considering suggestions for tweaks in the new long term capital gains tax regime that was announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman in Union Budget 2024.The July 23 budget reduced the LTCG tax on property from 20% to 12.5%. The indexation benefit, which allowed taxpayers to adjust the acquisition cost for inflation before calculating capital gains and thus reduce their tax liability, is proposed to be eliminated for properties purchased on or after April 1, 2001.The government publishes the Cost Inflation Index (CII) annually for this calculation.India Inc is appealing to the government for a gradual shift to the long-term capital gains tax regime proposed in the FY25 budget, which aims to eliminate indexation benefits for property, gold, and other unlisted assets.According to an ET report by Deepshikha Sikarwar, the industry is suggesting alternatives such as a higher tax rate with indexation or a lower rate of 12.5% without indexation, as well as some form of grandfathering for ancestral properties.The finance ministry is currently reviewing these proposals and will discuss them with the Prime Minister's Office. The final decision will be made closer to the date when the Finance Bill reply is to be presented in Parliament, the reports said.Industry groups are expected to submit formal proposals to the finance ministry in the near future.

Budget 2024 for manufacturing sector : The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth. While the middle class has been offered tax relief, the government's primary focus remains on judicious spending to maximize economic impact. The budget's core themes are employment, skilling, MSME development, and support for the middle class.Largely focus has remained intact on spending money judiciously to ensure that each penny spent creates a ripple effect in the entire economic landscape.Although at first glance, manufacturing might appear to have taken a backseat, a deeper analysis reveals a multifaceted approach to bolstering the sector. Initiatives like employment-linked benefits and internship programs, while primarily aimed at job creation and skill development, indirectly benefit manufacturing companies by expanding the talent pool.Extensive focus on the MSME manufacturing units by way of extending term loan facility for purchase of machinery and equipment without collateral or third-party guarantee, would help companies in augmenting their capital base/ capacity and strengthen the very foundation of the manufacturing ecosystem in the country. Development of a new credit-assessment model by Public Sector Banks to assess MSME credit shall provide much needed regulatory relief to the units.With respect to the large manufacturing entities, while there is no direct fiscal/ tax incentive introduced in this budget, some support has been provided with an extensive focus on development of ‘industrial parks’ in nearly 100 cities under the ‘plug and play’ model. Reforms proposed with respect to land administration, planning and management, shall also ease out acquisition related difficulties often faced by entrepreneurs/ business houses in acquiring lands for manufacturing set-ups.Targeted Customs duty interventions like, rationalization of Customs duty provisions in Mobile phone manufacturing setups, extension of Customs duty exemption on import of capital goods for manufacturing of solar cells and panels, full Customs duty exemption on import of 25 critical minerals,, shall provide the required impetus for enhancing domestic manufacturing environment.Governments’ focus on formulating an Economic Policy Framework to set the scope for next-gen reforms in the country, has a target to improve the productivity of factors of production, namely, land, labour, capital, entrepreneurship and technology. This shall pave the way for enabling achievement of a target of 25% manufacturing sector contribution to the nation’s GDP over the course of next 7-10 years.While the overall outlook is positive, the extension of tax benefits under Section 115BAB for manufacturing entities and the absence of new PLI schemes are notable omissions.The country’s manufacturing base is expanding as is reflective from the continuously increasing tax collections and expanding Purchasing Manager’s Index. It would be pertinent to see how the ground realities evolve vis-à-vis the vision envisaged, in the upcoming Financial Year.","The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth.

Budget 2024: Armed with the vision to propel India to become a developed country by 2047, the Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business thereby providing the required stimulus to the manufacturing sector and enabling large scale job creation.On the Indirect tax front, the industry welcomes the much-needed announcement for a comprehensive review of the rate structure under Customs enabling ease in product classification and dispute reduction. The proposal of lowering of Customs duty on a plethora of raw materials and products including solar cells, critical minerals and bullion are encouraging measures. The rationale behind such reduction clearly indicates support towards domestic manufacturing, deepening value addition and supporting targets in reducing carbon footprint.Relevant amendments under the Customs law have been made to provide increased time limits for re-imports and re-exports to enhance competitiveness of the fledgling MRO sector. The government has extended significant duty reduction and exemption benefits to the healthcare and electronics sectors, continuing the impetus of incentives provided under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme.Since their introduction in March 2020, the PLI schemes have indeed supported in revitalizing the manufacturing sector and strengthening the necessary supply chains. The success achieved in the mobile manufacturing sector has now enabled the Government to reduce customs duties on mobile phones and components, signalling a mature environment. The Budget proposals aim at reproducing similar outcomes for semiconductor and pharmaceutical industry by increasing the budgetary allocation.Buoyed by the increasing revenue collection under GST signalling a shift towards a mature tax regime, this Budget has harmonized the timeframes for the issuance of demand notices and adjudication orders for cases involving fraud, suppression or otherwise. Significant amendments to the GST legislations have been introduced reflecting the recommendations proposed by the GST Council such as regularizing non-levy of GST due to general practice which may turn out to be a breather for certain impacted industries reeling under huge tax demands.The Insurance sector has been provided much relief through the GST council recommendations which have been cemented in the present budget thereby ending long standing disputes on their business practices.The Government's efforts to push forward with its reform agenda are evident as plans to incentivize states for their business reform actions plans and digitalization through the Jan Vishwas Bill 2.0 is proposed. Further, setting up of e-commerce export hubs is envisaged to facilitate easier access to international markets for domestic players.The recent implementation of Budget proposals allows the government to maintain momentum in its reform agenda. These policy measures implicitly reaffirm the significance of India Inc as a crucial element in the development of infrastructure. However, there are still some expectations required to be met to march towards a Viksit Bharat 2047.",The Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business.

Budget 2024 : Real estate, a significant contributor to employment generation, has received a fair bit of attention in Budget 2024-25. Recent years have seen the sector transform rapidly, driven by factors such as favourable government policies, Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, strong economic growth and changing consumer preferences.Added to that, the budgetary focus on job creation, skilling and employment-linked incentives, infrastructure, urban development, rural connectivity, digitalisation and land-related norms, all dovetail to promote growth of the sector.Launched in June 2015, the PMAY aims to provide affordable housing to all eligible beneficiaries. The budget unveiled PMAY Urban 2.0, under which the housing needs of 1 crore urban poor and middle class will be addressed with an investment of Rs 10 lakh crore.The central government’s additional Rs 2.2 lakh crore injection in the next 5 years to make housing more affordable has the potential to revitalise the affordable housing market.Such an approach can play an important role in realising the government's vision of Housing for All and push growth and development. Hence, the significant investment under PMAY Urban 2.0 is expected to alleviate urban housing deficits, spurring construction and economic growth.Steps to introduce technological reforms within the regulatory framework for land, such as digitalisation or GIS mapping of land records, will improve transparency.Rationalisation of stamp duty across states will also be critical to bring in uniformity and initiate land-related reforms such as urban planning, usage and building bylaws.These are steps in the right direction and will boost growth. Moreover, they will improve the ease of property transactions and strengthen municipal finances through increased property taxes. Rationalization of stamp duty with an emphasis on women homebuyers may boost home-buyer sentiment in major cities, too.The budget has also given ample attention to urban and rural development, with rental housing for industrial workers through the public private partnership model, interest subsidies for rental housing, and transit-oriented developments.The proposal to develop investment-ready plug-and-play industrial parks in 100 cities may attract industrial investment, leading to increased demand for industrial real estate and support the growth of ancillary services and residential developments in these regions.Initiatives for industrial parks and rental housing for industrial workers align with the country’s manufacturing goals and addresses worker accommodation needs.These steps are expected to promote industrial growth and stability in labour-intensive sectors, while also creating new opportunities for real estate developers specialising in rental and affordable housing.The changes in long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax, however, have evoked a mixed reaction. The government lowered the long-term capital gains tax from 20% to 12.5%, which is a welcome step. However, this came with the removal of the indexation benefit.The changes could encourage more liquidity in property transactions and potentially increase the effective tax burden depending on the property’s acquisition date.The launch of Phase IV of the PM Gram Sadak Yojana in 25,000 rural habitations will improve connectivity in rural areas, promoting rural development and making these regions more accessible for investment. The primary objective of PMGSY is to build robust, all-weather roads in rural habitations. This initiative focuses on enhancing connectivity and supporting economic development in rural areas.In essence, the budget is geared towards stimulating growth and investment in the real estate sector , fostering a more transparent and investor-friendly environment, and contributing to overall development. It aims to create a balanced and inclusive growth environment by addressing the needs of various segments, including affordable housing, industrial workers and urban infrastructure.The effectiveness of the initiatives, however, hinges on their implementation and continued support of complementary reforms.","Budget 2024-25 is geared towards stimulating growth and investment in the real estate sector.

New Budget 2024 rule: Why Income Tax Department is likely to issue a huge number of tax notices this month,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-budget-2024-rule-why-income-tax-department-is-likely-to-issue-a-huge-number-of-tax-notices-this-month/articleshow/112186079.cms,"Taxing Times

Income Tax Notice on the way? The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month, as there are concerns that many taxpayers might escape the tax net due to the impending implementation of the new reassessment law on September 1, 2024.According to the amended regulation announced in Budget 2024 , the tax authorities can only go back a maximum of five years to reassess a taxpayer's records if the escaped income is at least Rs 50 lakh, and three years for an amount less than Rs 50 lakh.Previously, they could reassess cases up to 10 years old.According to an ET report, tax officials are now faced with the challenge of compiling and corroborating data on tax and income mismatches for the financial years 2013-14 to 2017-18 within the next few weeks, as these years will become time-barred for reassessment from September 1, 2024.The I-T department relies on information from various sources, such as banks, property registrars, and search findings from the investigation wing, to build reassessment cases.A tax officers' body has raised concerns about the feasibility of issuing notices under Section 148 (or 148A) in a large number of cases within a single month, given the overburdened nature of the jurisdictional assessing officers and the time-consuming process of obtaining sanction from the chief commissioner, who is the specified authority for such notices.Moreover, the law provides taxpayers with the right to explain their position before reassessment orders are finalized, a process that most believe cannot be completed by the end of August.Also Read | ITR refund status for FY 2023-24: How to check income tax refund status online - here’s a step-by-step guide for incometax.gov.in & NSDL websites The Central Board of Direct Taxes ( CBDT ) has been urged by its officers to postpone the effective date of the proposed amendment. However, this suggestion is unlikely to be well-received by corporations and high net worth individuals.""Capping the reassessment period at five years was a great decision as it would reduce hassles and litigation. But if the department fears there could be a genuine loss of revenue as it may not be possible to wrap up several matters by August 31, the government can think of strict parameters where time-bound cases can be selectively reopened - based on trails of steps taken in identifying escaped income,"" said Mitil Chokshi, partner at CA firm Chokshi & Chokshi.""Taxpayers may expect a rush of reassessment notices in August 2024. These notices are likely to be for the AYs 2018-19 and prior to that. It is pertinent to note that the Bombay High Court in a recent ruling in a case of Hexaware Technologies has taken a view on a proviso introduced in 2021, which can be interpreted to mean that AY 2017-18 (and prior years) got time barred on March 31, 2024. These reassessment notices (for AYs 2017-18 and prior) are likely to rake up new interpretation issues in the already muddled reassessment provisions,"" said Ashish Mehta, partner at law firm Khaitan & Co.The current situation is similar to the conflict between the Income Tax office and taxpayers in 2021. The reassessment law was amended in April 2021, allowing the tax office to reopen 10-year-old tax returns if the total undisclosed income exceeded Rs 50 lakh and reassess 4-year-old matters if the amount was less than Rs 50 lakh.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? However, this change led to over 10,000 writ petitions being filed by companies, arguing that they were not given sufficient time to explain and that the notices were issued without considering the carve-out that cases which couldn't be reopened earlier couldn't be reassessed under the new law.The Supreme Court invoked its extraordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution on May 4, 2022, to uphold all reassessment notices issued after March 31, 2021. However, the court left room for judicial proceedings based on the merits of each case, and several such matters are currently pending before the court.","The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month.

Are NPS Vatsalya & hiked NPS deduction limit for private sector employees good moves from Budget 2024?

NPS and EPF: Overlapping services

What is NPS Vatsalaya?

Latest NPS rules, news: In the Union Budget 2024 speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced two new initiatives with regard to National Pension Scheme (NPS) - extension of NPS 14% employer contribution benefits to private setcor and the intended launch of NPS Vatsalya.Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries, bringing it at par with the provisions available for government employees.Sriram Iyer, CEO, HDFC Pension Management told ET that with this move the “ground rules have been harmonised among government and non-government employees, which is a positive step.”Effectively, this means that now, private-sector employees can choose to reduce the taxable portion of employers’ contribution to their NPS corpus, thereby paying less tax and leaving greater funds in their pension deposits.“Employees will benefit from tax savings . More importantly, the 40% increase in contribution will have a significant impact on the terminal value of the retirement corpus,” remarked Iyer. The extended savings will “help in retirement planning, working as an option that is at par with the Provident Fund,” Dinesh Rohira, CEO & Founder, 5nance.com was quoted as saying.Moreover, the endeavour aims to increase NPS penetration by increasing tax incentives for the private sector, providing them a social security-cushion post-retirement.The scheme’s motive to widen the NPS subscriber base may not prove to be flawlessly effective, however. This is explained by Agrees Mrin Agarwal, Founder, Finsafe India: “While it’s good that the limit has been raised, it may not increase adoption as employees need to be educated in a big way. Also, the benefit is only for the salaried opting for the new tax regime,” she says.The mandatory contribution to the EPF, too, threatens to relegate the provisions of NPS under the umbrella of near-superfluity. This sentiment is echoed by Varun Sahay, a software engineer in a Delhi-based IT company: “When 12% of my salary is already deducted for the EPF, why should I put in more in the NPS and cut my take-home pay?”Rohira feels otherwise. “There’s no competition between the NPS and EPF as employees can contribute to both and build a 3-4 times bigger corpus while earning 3-4% higher returns via marketlinked options in the NPS,” he counters.Also Check | New Tax Regime 2023 vs 2024 After Budget: How Much Income Tax Will Salaried Taxpayers Save & How Do New Tax Slabs Compare To Old Regime? Top 10 Points You Must Know To jumpstart retirement savings for children, a new initiative called NPS Vatsalya has been unveiled in the Budget. This scheme allows parents and guardians to contribute to a minor's account, which can be converted into a regular NPS account once the child reaches adulthood.""It provides a very long duration for reaping the compounding benefits and accumulating a huge bounty at a later age. This can be a good way to plan a better future for kids who may not opt for a service segment in the future,"" says Rohira. Sriram Iyer agrees, stating, ""It’s a good move to help the child start his retirement journey. Even if a parent starts when the child is 10 years old, by the time he starts working, it can be a solid foundation for the compounding journey after that.""However, some experts question the utility of a product with such a long lock-in period, especially when parents cannot use the funds for essential goals like their child’s education amidst soaring education costs of 11-12%.""Parents are struggling to save for their own retirement, so it might be a bit of a stretch to expect them to save for their kids’ retirement. The need of the hour is a market-linked product that allows withdrawals only for the child’s education,"" says Mrin Agarwal, Founder of Finsafe India.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? Though the NPS permits partial withdrawals, it allows only 25% of the corpus after three years of joining, and this can be done only three times during the entire tenure. A premature exit before 60 years with 100% withdrawal is only possible if the corpus is less than Rs.2.5 lakh, an amount insufficient for most children's goals.""In its current form, there won’t be any uptake,"" asserts Agarwal. Rohira concurs, ""It’s a vanilla product with a lock-in, which does not make it very attractive and it may not take off. However, the government may optimise it and introduce new features later."" Iyer adds, ""This is just a start and there may be more subscriber-friendly features as we take it to the market. The regulator is proactive and open to feedback.""","Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries.

Gold import duty cut: Why Indians may not find buying gold from Dubai as attractive post Budget 2024,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-import-duty-cut-why-indians-may-not-find-buying-gold-from-dubai-as-attractive-post-budget-2024/articleshow/112097671.cms,"Gold import duty cut in Budget 2024: The recent reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai. Indian jewellers with stores in both India and the UAE believe that the narrowed duty differential will result in lower gold prices in India, making it less attractive for Indians to purchase gold in Dubai.The emirate had attracted gold-enthusiast Indians following a steep rise in customs duty in India in July 2022. In the fiscal 2024-25 budget, the duty on gold imports was more than halved.The duty cut is also expected to boost gold jewellery production in India, particularly the popular 'Kolkatti' jewellery from Kolkata, which is favored by Indian expats in Dubai and tourists from various countries. This move will encourage gold artisans to create new designs in both heavyweight and lightweight jewellery, attracting consumers to purchase gold from India.According to an ET report, Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group , estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India as Indian tourists who previously bought jewellery in Dubai will now prefer to shop in India. However, Indian expats living in Dubai and other customers may continue to buy from the UAE.Also Read | Gold losing sheen?

He points out that the labour cost is significantly lower in India, and with the introduction of mandatory hallmarking and HUID numbers, the purity of gold in India is no longer a concern.Furthermore, NRIs in Dubai do not receive VAT refunds, and Indians travelling abroad only receive about 60% of the VAT back on their gold purchases. Gold trade analyst Bhargav Baidya suggests that the 1% duty differential between gold jewellery in India and Dubai will be offset by Indian jewellers offering discounts to retain and attract customers.Saurabh Gadgil, chairman of PNG Jewellers, notes that Indian import duty is now on par with the US, allowing Indian jewellers to offer competitive prices compared to other countries worldwide. The reduced customs duty is expected to make gold purchases in India more attractive and convenient for Indian consumers, potentially leading to a significant shift in their gold shopping preferences.",The reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai.

Gold losing sheen? The government has reduced its target for issuing gold bonds in the financial year 2024-25 by 38% compared to the previous interim budget goal, according to a senior official. The revised target stands at Rs 18,500 crore, down from Rs 29,638 crore estimated in the interim budget and Rs 26,852 crore (revised estimate) in 2023-24.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told ET ""The decision followed a reassessment of various factors, including investor demand, other investment products and uncertainties around the global economy, as the situation has changed since the interim budget in February.""After accounting for redemptions, the net issuances of sovereign gold bonds are now estimated at Rs 15,000 crore for this fiscal year, a significant decrease from the Rs 26,138 crore projected in the interim budget and Rs 25,352 crore in the revised estimate for 2023-24.Harish Galipelli, director at ILA Commodities India, attributed this shift to retail investors increasingly opting for equities in anticipation of better returns. He also noted that people are uncertain about the potential for further increases in gold prices in the short-to-medium term following a recent rally. Additionally, Galipelli pointed out that savings in rural areas have been impacted by retail inflation and other factors.The gold bond and gold monetisation schemes were introduced by the government in late 2015 to discourage the physical purchase of precious metals and reduce imports, thereby mitigating the negative impact on the current account deficit.The gross collection through these two schemes is now projected to be Rs 20,030 crore in 2024-25, compared to Rs 31,168 crore in the interim budget and Rs 28,240 crore (revised estimate) in the previous fiscal year. Similarly, the net collection is estimated at Rs 16,433 crore, down from Rs 27,571 crore in the interim budget and Rs 26,653 crore in the previous year.

Both schemes were designed to curb gold imports, which, along with crude oil, have been significant contributors to India's current account deficit.

MUMBAI: Reacting to complaints of "" toxic work culture "" by Sebi officials to the finance ministry , the market regulator Wednesday said junior officers - with an annual entry cost-to-company remuneration of Rs 34 lakh and are demanding a further increase - have been ""misguided"" by external elements to target the credibility of the agency and its leadership, reports Partha Sinha.Arguing that the Aug 6 letter to the ministry was not sent by employee associations but was an anonymous email, Sebi said the external elements had got junior officers to believe that they were underpaid and should get automatic promotions. The statement came in response to an ET report that quoted the complaint as saying ""shouting, scolding and public humiliation have become the norm"" at Sebi.The complaint was sent by around 500 officers to govt. ""It is unfortunate that some elements have attempted to diminish the significant capabilities of Sebi employees by instigating employees to believe that, as 'employees of a regulator' they should not be required to have such high standards of performance and accountability,"" Sebi said in a rare five-page statement.Sebi's clarification, however, is silent on the ""toxicity"" complaints that the officers said was at the core of their grievance.Relating to the officers' claims about unprofessional work culture, as mentioned in the letter to the Finmin, Sebi said such claims were misplaced. These could be because of instances such as 'under-pitching of processing capability of officers by as low as (a fourth) of (their) actual capacity, mis-reporting of status of achievement of KRAs, shuttling of files between departments over a long period to avoid taking decisions, 'adjusting' appraisal marks of poorly performing officers to 'somehow' make them eligible for promotion etc, Sebi clarified. ""In such instances, the officers concerned have been held accountable, given firm feedback, and corrective actions taken,"" it said.The clarification titled 'HRA issues of staff misguided by external elements to target credibility of Sebi and its leadership?' followed a day of hectic activity at the Sebi headquarters. A demonstration by the officers that was planned for Sept 5, has now been cancelled.The statement said that there were demands from employees to increase the HRA by 55% over the allowance fixed last year. It also said that Sebi officers who ""are already well paid"" with the remuneration comparing ""extremely favourably even with the corporate sector"" would push up their annual CTC by Rs 6 lakh, or by around 17.6%, if the additional demands were met.Sebi said that most of its employees had agreed with the new systems that are being put in place. These systems include finalising KRAs (key result/responsibility areas) at the start of the year, monthly MIS (management information system) reviews, annual performance review of each team by whole time members and the chairperson, promotion policy etc.Adoption of technology to improve productivity across the organization was also one of the new initiatives within Sebi that employees have 'embraced', the regulator said.","Sebi says junior officers have been ""misguided"" by external elements to target credibility of the agency and its leadership.

The government took advantage by leaning on them to cut petrol and diesel prices by Rs 2 per litre on March 14, just ahead of General Election.Even after that first reduction in pump prices since May 2022, a Motilal Oswal Financial Services report in April had projected a gross marketing margin of more than Rs 2 per litre in April when the Indian Basket, or the mix of crude processed by Indian refiners, averaged $89.44 per barrel. This would have swollen further by now as the basket, which trails Brent by $2-4 per barrel, averaged $76 in September.But the jury is out on whether the government would capitalise on the situation by seeking another cut in pump prices again in view of analysts predicting oil price volatility. Projecting prices to remain volatile in the near term, financial services company UBS bet on the oil market remaining undersupplied. Goldman Sachs too has forecast $70-85/barrel price range.The government will be comfortably placed even if the current low prices do not last long but level out at $85, which will give it the leeway to ask the state-run retailers to keep pump prices frozen ‘voluntarily’ as, what oil minister Hardeep Singh Puri describes as ‘good corporate citizens’ — as has been seen in the last three years.“Even as the entire world suffered 40-70% fuel inflation during last 3 years, this spirit of IndianOil kept Indian citizens insulated from soaring global fuel prices, as PM @narendramodi Ji didn’t want our citizens, specially the vulnerable ones, to suffer from crises of fuel availability, affordability and sustainability,” oil minister Hardeep Singh Puri said in a recent post on microblogging site X.","The steady decline in oil prices has led to positive marketing margins for the fuel retailers, especially the state-run entities who cater to 90% of the market.

On Tuesday, Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris argued that US Steel should remain under domestic ownership, while Republican nominee Donald Trump vowed to block the deal if elected.Despite the criticism, US Steel and Nippon Steel have defended the agreement, highlighting its potential benefits.Earlier on Wednesday, Nippon Steel assured that if the deal proceeds, US citizens would hold key senior management positions and a majority of board seats at US Steel.Burritt also mentioned that the planned expansion of the company’s Arkansas mill would enable the closure of its last steelmaking operation in Pittsburgh’s Mon Valley, with a likely relocation of the company’s headquarters to the South.The deal has received regulatory approvals from outside the US and approval from US Steel’s shareholders, but it is still under regulatory review in the United States.",US Steel may close its mills and relocate its headquarters from Pittsburgh if the $14.9 billion buyout by Nippon Steel falls through.

Britain's FTSE 100 also dropped 0.8% to 8,230.49.

Taiwan's Taiex lost 4.5%, dragged down by the heavyweight Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, which was 5.4% lower.Australia's S&P/ASX 200 was down 1.9% and ended at 7,950.50 after Wednesday data showed the country's GDP grew by 1% compared to the second quarter of 2023, slightly above experts' forecast. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index declined 1.1% to 17,457.34 and the Shanghai Composite index shed 0.7% to 2,784.28.Rising oil supply was driving down prices, as Libya moved closer to resolving a conflict over control of the country's oil revenue that meant its oil production may soon increase.Benchmark US crude fell 57 cents to $69.77 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, lost 75 cents to $73.00 a barrel.Growing worries about China's economy - the world's largest importer of crude oil - also amplified doubts about future oil demand, especially after the recent release of weak data, which was dragged down by a real estate slump and weak consumption.The S&P 500's heaviest weight, Nvidia, fell 9.5% Tuesday. Its stock has been struggling even after the chip company topped high expectations for its latest profit report. The subdued performance could bolster criticism that Nvidia and other Big Tech stocks simply soared too high in Wall Street's frenzy around artificial intelligence technology.The S&P 500 sank 2.1% to give back a chunk of the gains from a three-week winning streak that had carried it to the cusp of its all-time high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 626 points, or 1.5%, from its own record set on Friday before Monday's Labor Day holiday. The Nasdaq composite fell 3.3% as Nvidia and other Big Tech stocks led the way lower.Treasury yields also stumbled in the bond market after a report showed American manufacturing shrank again in August, sputtering under the weight of high interest rates.

Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips witnessed losses of 2.1% and 3.5%, respectively.Investors are closely monitoring several upcoming labor market reports, particularly the August non-farm payrolls data set to be released on Friday.Additionally, investor confidence was further dampened by the Institute for Supply Management's report, which indicated that US manufacturing activity remained sluggish in August, despite a slight improvement from July's eight-month low.The bond market also faced challenges as Treasury yields stumbled following a report indicating that US manufacturing contracted again in August, struggling under the burden of elevated interest rates.The upcoming Federal Reserve meeting scheduled for September 17-18 is also in focus, especially after Chair Jerome Powell recently expressed support for easing monetary policy.According to the CME Group's FedWatch Tool, the probability of a 25-basis point interest rate cut stands at 63%, while the likelihood of a more significant 50 bps reduction is at 37%.","S&P 500 plunges 2.1% or 119.47 points to settle at 5,528.93, reducing gains it registered during a three-week rally.

Nvidia suffers record $279 billion rout as AI worry sinks stocks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/nvidia-suffers-record-279-billion-rout-as-ai-worry-sinks-stocks/articleshow/113048647.cms,"Four weeks after US stocks buckled amid a global flight from risk assets, chipmakers touched off another bout of equities selling when a pair of industry analysts rekindled worries that the mania surrounding artificial intelligence had gone too far.Nvidia Corp shares tumbled 9.5%, wiping out $278.9 billion in the biggest loss of value ever for a US stock.It is now down 14% in the three sessions since it reported earnings that failed to live up to lofty expectations. All 30 members of the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index sank at least 5.4%, with On Semiconductor, KLA Corp and Monolithic Power Systems Inc down more than 9%. The Nasdaq 100 sank almost 3.2%. Nvidia shares lost another 2% in late trading after the US Justice Department sent subpoenas to it and other companies as it seeks evidence that the chipmaker violated antitrust laws.There were other reasons for the bleak start to what is historically a volatile month for stocks. Worries about China’s growth shook commodities markets from oil to copper. US manufacturing data came in light and showed an uptick in prices paid, a potentially worrying sign for inflation hawks. But most catalyzing for the tech rout were the fresh warnings that AI’s promise to rewire global economies was far from being realized, making it hard to justify lofty valuations.That was the gist of views expressed in separate commentaries from JPMorgan Asset Management and BlackRock Investment Institute. Michael Cembalest, chairman of market and investment strategy at JPAM, warned that spending on AI won’t be justified unless demand for AI services from companies outside of tech starts to increase. For Jean Boivin head of BlackRock Investment, “patience is needed” before AI takes off, a process of “years, not quarters.”Those warnings, of course, aren’t new. Alphabet Inc shares got hit in July after it reported a spike in AI spending with no promise of a commensurate bump in profits, prompting a rotation out of big tech. But the two latest cautions landed in a market that rallied to just short of records in late August, largely on the promise that the US economy won’t crater before the Federal Reserve delivers rate cuts later this month.“Are we actually going to stick this soft landing, or are we going to get some type of a report later this week that shows unemployment is starting to rise substantially?” said Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management. “That’s where you’re starting to see a lot of this volatility coincide, and it’s just hitting the most overvalued sectors first, and people are starting to look for actual earnings growth, real revenues on the balance sheet. And more importantly than anything, really stable forward guidance.”The Cboe Voalitlity Index jumped above 20 as the S&P 500 dropped more than 2%, with all but two sectors lower. Like in early August, the selloff spread to other assets. Oil sank 4% and Treasury yields dropped as investors sought havens.The damage done in the chip sector was extensive, with the Philadelphia semiconductor index dropping the most since March 2020. Intel Corp, whose shares are the second-worst performing in the Philadelphia semiconductor index this year, fell 8.8%. Chip equipment maker Applied Materials Inc fell 7%. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world’s biggest contract manufacturer of chips, dropped roughly the same.Alphabet, Microsoft Corp and Apple Inc lost at least 1.9% as the pain spread to the biggest tech companies looking to reshape the economy with AI.“Outside of the big tech companies buying among themselves, we haven’t really seen AI spread out across the economy,” Paul Nolte, market strategist and senior wealth manager at Murphy & Sylvest Wealth Management, said. “There’s still a big question about the ROI from all this spending. And if you go back to the dot-com era, the first winners of the internet weren’t always the final winners. We’re not yet at a place, in terms of valuations, where I’d want to buy this dip.”While the August 5 market rout rattled investors around the globe, equities bounced back almost immediately, adding more than 5% through the end of the month. Nvidia itself was among the leaders of that rebound, but as the Fed signaled unequivocally that it intends to cut rates, the rally was especially broad.The near-term calendar promises some key economic data releases, especially Friday’s US payrolls report, that will solidify bets on the Fed’s path. But traders will have to wait three weeks for confirmation.“With equities sharply off the August lows as we enter a well-known period of weak seasonality, and with the first rate cut widely expected and arguably already priced in, it’s not too surprising to see some de-risking as investors await more data/clarity,” Christopher Jacobson, co-head of derivative strategy at Susquehanna International Group.","Nvidia Corp shares tumbled 9.5%, wiping out $278.9 billion in the biggest loss of value ever for a US stock.
