‘Vande Bharat Bullet Train’ soon? Indian Railways looks to roll out ‘Make in India’ bullet trains with 250 kmph speed this year,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/vande-bharat-bullet-train-soon-indian-railways-looks-to-roll-out-make-in-india-bullet-trains-with-250-kmph-speed-this-year/articleshow/110783813.cms,"Bullet train project

‘ Make in India ’ bullet trains on Vande Bharat platform! The Indian Railways has assigned the Integral Coach Factory ( ICF ) the task of domestically producing two standard-gauge bullet trains within the current fiscal year. This decision comes as negotiations with Japanese suppliers encountered obstacles due to pricing disagreements, according to officials.According to an ET report by Twesh Mishra, for the first time, India will manufacture a train capable of reaching a maximum speed of 250 kilometers per hour (kmph). These two trains are intended to operate on the Rs 1.08 lakh crore Mumbai-Ahmedabad High Speed Rail corridor.It is likely that the trains will be constructed using the Vande Bharat platform. Although utilizing an existing platform would assist ICF in reducing the time required to deliver the train sets, experts noted that supplying them within this fiscal year would be a challenging task.A senior official familiar with the development was quoted as saying, ""ICF, Chennai has been tasked to build and deliver two standard-gauge trainsets of eight cars, each featuring a steel car body, and a running speed of 220 kmph and a maximum speed of 250 kmph.""The official added that the order for the trains was placed earlier this week. Officials said that discussions with a consortium of Japanese rolling stock suppliers, Hitachi and Kawasaki, have been ongoing for an extended period but have made little progress.Also Check | New Vande Bharat sleeper coming soon! What's special about it? Check top features and photos of Indian Railways new train The cost of a 10-coach bullet train was estimated at Rs 389 crore in 2018, with each train expected to reach cruising speeds of over 300 kmph. In 2023, the estimated supply cost was revised to Rs 460 crore per train set. Despite the Japanese consortium's willingness to supply the 'Shinkansen' train sets, the Indian Railways remains unconvinced about the offered price.The bullet train project has experienced significant delays from its original completion deadline of 2022, primarily due to land acquisition challenges in Maharashtra. Experts believe that ICF will face an uphill battle to meet the timeline set by the Indian Railways for developing trains capable of running at 250 kmph.Sudhanshu Mani, a retired Indian Railways official credited with developing the first variant of the Vande Bharat trains, noted that the current top speed of Vande Bharat trains is only 180 kmph. He added, ""This bullet train development and supply target can be achieved by ICF over three to four years.”",Indian Railways has assigned the Integral Coach Factory ( ICF ) the task of domestically producing two standard-gauge bullet trains within the current fiscal year.

Godrej L’Affaire: Leading events and experiences with a commitment to environmental stewardship,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/godrej-laffaire-leading-events-and-experiences-with-a-commitment-to-environmental-stewardship/articleshow/110763814.cms,"Disclaimer: This article has been produced on behalf of Godrej by Times Internet’s Spotlight team.

In a world rife with corporate slogans about making a difference, it's easy to become cynical. Not everyone believes that businesses can be a force for good and green behaviour. Yet, in this era of skepticism, there are organisations committed to goodness, not just as slogans but as a philosophy that permeates every aspect of their operations, from product development to community engagement.Godrej Industries, with its unique approach, strives to integrate the philosophy of Good and Green into everything they do, from their sustainable practices to the experiences they curate. This ethos is perhaps most vividly showcased through their owned media property, Godrej L'Affaire - a brand-agnostic platform to celebrate nuances of lifestyle in an experiential manner. This year’s rollout that culminated recently had a relevant theme - “all things goodness”. This platform sought to highlight the impact of deliberate good choices that contribute positively to society. Over 1000 content creators and celebrities witnessed the magic of over 55 participating brands.Elaborating on the impact, Sujit Patil, Chief Communications Officer, Brand and Corporate Communications, Godrej Industries Group said, “Even large-scale events can be sustainable and to bring out this element, we ensured that at each stage of Godrej L’Affaire, elements of sustainability are demonstrated. The entire event was audited by Skrap, a sustainability leader that helps businesses achieve zero-waste goals. Godrej L'Affaire 2024 achieved a zero-waste-to-landfill milestone through responsible waste management practices. Partnering with Skrap, we diverted an impressive 94.8% of event waste (1,843.2 kgs) from landfills, the same was recycled, composted, reused, or donated. This reduced our carbon footprint by an estimated 2,697 kgs, equivalent to what 44.6 saplings could capture in 10 years or carbon sequestered in 3.1 acres of US forests in a year, or the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by burning 1347 Kgs of coal. Hence establishing the fact that community events can also be highly sustainable. We understand that experiences are powerful. They shape who we are and how we connect with the world. But for experiences to be truly ""good"" they can't exist in a vacuum. A healthy environment is the foundation for a thriving lifestyle, and one cannot tackle climate change with hashtags alone.”This understanding is why, for World Environment Day 2024, Godrej L'Affaire joined hands with the Bhamla Foundation and Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Maharashtra Forest Department, Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai, Maharashtra Pollution Control Board for a campaign aptly christened as #BhoomiNamaskar. Meaning ""Salutation to the Earth"" in Hindi, this campaign highlights the importance of nurturing our land.The campaign's focus on land restoration is timely and critical. As we grapple with the consequences of deforestation and land degradation, #BhoomiNamaskar seeks to inspire our generation to understand and fight for the countless species facing extinction. It's about more than just planting trees—it's about nurturing the land that sustains us, preserving vital water resources, and ensuring a sustainable future.Mr. Patil further added, “By supporting #BhoomiNamaskar, Godrej L'Affaire is demonstrating that a platform celebrating lifestyle can—and should—champion environmental causes. After all, what good is a fashionable wardrobe or a gourmet meal if we don't have a healthy planet to enjoy them on? This collaboration underscores Godrej L'Affaire's holistic view of goodness, one that encompasses personal well-being, community welfare, and environmental health. By participating in and promoting this initiative, we aim to inspire others to take meaningful steps towards a sustainable future. We recognise that the journey towards sustainability is ongoing. We are committed to continually evolving our practices and pushing the boundaries of what it means to be a responsible corporate citizen. Our goal is to create a legacy of goodness that transcends generations, ensuring a better, healthier planet for all.”The success of #BhoomiNamaskar lies in its simplicity and profound impact. It serves as a reminder that every small action counts. Whether it's planting a tree, conserving water, or reducing waste, every effort contributes to the larger goal of restoring our planet- It starts with us.","Godrej Industries strives to integrate the philosophy of Good and Green into everything they do, from their sustainable practices to the experiences they curate.

On whether Emirates is looking for partners in India, Kazim said it is open to any such future engagements if there is an appetite in an Indian airline for that sort of dialogue and engagement.For the full-service carrier, he said India is a top-tier market, and the demand today is exceeding the current capacity offered in the country.Currently, the airline operates direct flights to nine Indian cities from Dubai.Over the years, the airline has been pitching for enhanced bilateral rights between the two countries, which is currently at 65,000 seats per week, to operate at a higher capacity to meet the rising travel demand.""India has always remained an important market for Emirates. It has a high demand with 171 weekly frequencies that we operate between India and Dubai, connecting nine points. Demand is standing very strong, and as a market (India), it (demand) is not linked to seasons or holidays...,"" Kazim, who is the Deputy President and Chief Commercial Officer (CCO), said.In an interview with PTI in Dubai this week, he said more airlines opening up and ordering wide-body planes for long-haul operations in India are good aspects that will create more options and choices for consumers.He emphasised that India, with a population of close to 1.5 billion, is seeing a growing international travel demand, and that needs to be coped with more capacity.""We need to be mindful of the speed of the growth the Indian aviation is going through and the capacity growth that is something that needs to be matched,"" he said.Currently, the bilateral flying rights allow Dubai carriers -- Emirates and Flydubai -- to operate 65,000 seats weekly to India.Similarly, Indian airlines can operate 65,000 seats to Dubai every week.The flying rights on both sides are fully utilised and the last upward revision in the number of seats happened in 2015.Emirates flies to Delhi, Chennai, Bengaluru, Kochi, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Mumbai, Thiruvananthapuram and Ahmedabad. Indian carriers -- Air India, Air India Express, IndiGo, SpiceJet and Vistara -- operate flights to Dubai.Talking on the sidelines of the IATA annual general meeting here this week, Kazim also said that a decision on bilateral flying rights is between the governments of India and the UAE.""I look at an angle where India and UAE relationship is strong and strategic...we need to be optimistic,"" he added.""We have solid engagements and dialogues with many entities in India. We are quite satisfied and happy with the support we are getting from all the stakeholders on the ground in India,"" he said.The airline has an interline agreement with SpiceJet.India is one of the world's fastest-growing civil aviation markets, and domestic airlines are expanding their operations and fleet to meet the rising traffic demand.""Competition is a welcome thing. In Dubai, more than 100 airlines are operating, and there is freedom of traffic to carry from anywhere to anywhere...the ecosystem of Dubai is around collaboration with different entities and working together,"" Kazim said.According to him, a single airline cannot cover the world and stressed the need for partnerships and collaborations.""That is why today, even though we have 140 plus stations, we have 150 airlines with whom we have interline or codeshare (agreements). That is the kind of stability we are creating today for ourselves in terms of entering into smaller markets and domains and creating options,"" Kazim said.",Emirates Deputy President and Chief Commercial Officer Adnan Kazim said India is a top-tier market.

Gujarat-based Kitchen Express Overseas Ltd had approached the AAAR against the ruling by the GST advance authority, saying that its seven ' instant flour mixes ' are not 'ready to eat' but are required to undergo certain cooking procedures and can be termed 'ready to cook'.The company sells flour mixes of gota, khaman, dalwada, dahi-wada, dhokla, idli and dosa in powder form and pleaded that it is akin to Sattu and should attract Goods and Services Tax (GST) of 5 per cent.The GAAAR rejected the appellant's contention, saying that ingredients which go into the making of 'instant flour mixes"" are not covered under the relevant GST rules as is the case with Sattu.According to a CBIC circular, small amounts of ingredients, which are mixed to make Sattu, are specified in the GST rules to be eligible for a 5% tax rate.""However, the said clarification is not applicable in the present case as the products being supplied by the appellant contain spices and other ingredients, which is not the case with the 'chhatua or sattu',"" the Gaaar said.The appellate authority also said that merely because the end consumer of the instant mix flour is required to follow certain food preparation processes before such products can be consumed is no grounds that 18 per cent GST should not be levied on it.Abhishek Jain, indirect tax head & partner, KPMG, said classification disputes are among the most common areas of litigation under the GST.""Despite the issuance of circulars, differing interpretations of the clarifications provided in these circulars have often elevated the challenges,"" Jain said.Moore Singhi Executive Director Rajat Mohan said the Gujarat Appellate Authority for Advance Ruling (AAAR) affirmed the ruling of the Advance Ruling Authority (AAR), classifying various 'Kitchen Express' branded flours, including Khaman and Dhokla, under Chapter Heading (CH) 2106 90 99, thereby subjecting them to an 18% GST rate.""The determination was predicated on the products' significant inclusion of additives, such as sugar, salt, and spices, distinguishing them from simpler flours classified under chapter 1101, 1102, or 1106, which attract a 5 per cent GST rate,"" Mohan said.The AAAR elucidated that CH 2106 90 99 encompasses 'ready to cook' food preparations and dismissed the appellant's analogy to 'sattu,' asserting that the substantial presence of additives in the appellant's products justifies the higher tax rate, Mohan added.","Gujarat-based Kitchen Express Overseas Ltd had approached the AAAR against the ruling by the GST advance authority.

The finance minister set the stage for a ""Viksit Bharat by 2047"", on the core principles of ‘Sabka Saath’, ‘Sabka Vikas’, ‘Sabka Vishwas’, with ‘Sabka Prayas’ being added as a new theme in the interim Budget.This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data i.e., farmer welfare and N for Nari utthan i.e., support for women entrepreneurs. These form the pillars of a comprehensive inclusive development. The Government's commitment to sustainable development under the strategy for Amrit Kaal includes achieving 'Net Zero' by 2070, rooftop solarization for one crore households and robust health initiatives.The Indian economy's resilience takes center stage amidst positive indicators of declining current account deficit as a percentage of GDP, falling unemployment rates, and a notable rise in digital transactions. These statistics affirm the robustness of the economy, showcasing a trajectory of growth and stability.The achievements in taxation reforms are nothing short of remarkable, with direct tax collections more than trebling in the last decade, the number of tax return filers increasing by 2.4 times, average processing time of tax returns plummeting from 93 days in FY 2013-14 to an impressive 10 days in FY 2023-24, resulting in issuance of quick refunds. These are the results of consistent progressive measures thus obviating the need for, and rightly avoiding, any last-minute populist measures.No change in existing tax rates, both for direct and indirect taxes, is a good indicator of stability and predictability for investors and taxpayers.A welcome move to waive outstanding tax demands that are minor, disputed, and unreconciled. This involves the withdrawal of outstanding direct tax demands up to Rs. 25,000 pertaining to the period up to FY 2009-10 and up to Rs.10,000 for FY 2010-11 to 2014-15.The Government's commitment to fostering a business-friendly environment is evident in its intent to extend specific tax benefits for start-ups, investments by sovereign wealth funds/ pension funds, and certain IFSC units. The extension has been made now until March 31, 2025. This might help in creating a conducive landscape for business.To align with the CBDT notification issued earlier, the provisions relating to tax collection at source concerning remittances under the Liberalized Remittance Scheme have now been formally incorporated in the Finance Bill, 2024, setting the rate at 20% for amounts exceeding Rs. 7 lakhs in a financial year.The Finance Bill, 2024 proposes an extension of the time limit for introducing the faceless scheme by the Central Government for transfer pricing proceedings, DRP Proceedings, and ITAT Proceedings, up to March 31, 2025.The interim Budget 2024 may not have proposed significant tax announcements, but it very well positioned the prelude to the full budget post the upcoming elections. Considering the potential impact on the population across the four pillars of GYAN, a sizable portion of India stands to be covered. The interim Budget’s focus on the tax front resembles a report card, highlighting the maturity achieved by our tax system. The enhancement of taxpayer services was emphasized as a key priority.","This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data and N for Nari utthan.

Interim Budget for a Viksit Bharat: It’s for everyone and all,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/interim-budget-for-a-viksit-bharat-its-for-everyone-and-all/articleshow/107497439.cms,"By Akhilesh Tuteja

The Finance Minister on February 01, 2024, delivered a truly innovative interim budget. At first glance, it did not seem like an interim budget but looked more like the budget to drive further growth and a continuum of inclusive growth-oriented investments.At the outset, this budget brings a wonderful balance between fiscal prudence and continued investment for growth. It's not easy to continue the glide path of reducing the fiscal deficit and continuing to make significant investments in all areas including infrastructure, R&D, energy transition, technology, skilling, and social welfare. The surprising reduction in fiscal deficit of 5.8% as against the budgeted 5.9% for FY24 and the projection of 5.1% in FY25 with a clear focus on increasing investments was a huge positive.This was a budget for everyone and all because it caters to every part of the Indian economy and society. The FM has carefully catered to the investment needs of various sectors. The continued focus on youth, impoverished, women and farmers to increase their involvement and contribution to economic growth is evident. By committing an 11.1% increase in capital expenditure to 11,11,111 lakh crore, the FM has clearly brought every single 1 in this growth journey.What was very impressive was the inclusion strategy of the government. The focus on women's empowerment for the past few years is unprecedented, which is reflected in the inclusion of women in the workforce moving from 23.3% to 37% in the last five years. The thirty crore Mudra Yojna loans to women entrepreneurs were a great boost to the Nari Shakti initiative. We already have over 10 million Lakhpati Didis and what is truly evident is like a corporate CFO, the FM has revised the earlier target of 20 million Lakhpati Didis to 30 million. The government also plans to invest in initiatives to encourage young girls between the ages of 9 and 14 to undertake the vaccination for cervical cancer which is again a great boost to Nari Shakti.A lot needs to be done to bring more women into all parts of economic growth but the journey so far and the vision of the future is truly inspiring.While India continues on its technological prowess and makes its mark in new technologies like Artificial Intelligence, we need a multi-pronged strategy to harness the power of AI. We need a clear focus on building AI systems in India so that we not only emerge as a global leader in this new era but can build models, which are specific to India that will benefit Indians. At the same time, we need a very wide coverage program to build skills to leverage AI to its fullest potential. The biggest contribution we can make to the inclusion of youth in the economic development of the country is by skilling them in new skill areas. In the last few years, the Skill India Mission has trained 14 million youth, reskilled over 5 million youth and established a staggering 3,000 new ITIs. The future of any country will depend as much on capital investments as on skill investments.The focus on agricultural development and support to the farmer continues through direct financial assistance to farmers. The farmers have benefited by getting crop insurance through PM Fasal Bima Yojana. It's not just the farmers, the PM-SVANidhi provides credit assistance to a large number of street vendors.The last few years have seen the journey of affordable housing through Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY). There is a slight increase in allocation to launch a scheme for encouraging the middle class to build or buy new homes. This investment will likely propel a wider economic development and increase employment.India has seen a tremendous rise in entrepreneurship in the last few years. In order to continue the journey and promote new startups, the government proposes to extend certain tax benefits, which are expiring from March 2024 to March 2025. The MSMEs have not been left behind. With a proposal to provide timely finances to such enterprises, the government has paved the way for their growth, so they can look to compete globally.All in all, it’s a truly inclusive budget with a clear focus on development not just by giving away freebies but enabling the people to participate in the economic development activity. While the FM calls the comprehensive GDP - Governance, Development & Performance – to me, this budget is inclusive of another GDP – gender, demography, and professions.","Akhilesh Tuteja is Partner and Head, Clients and Markets, KPMG in India.

‘Enough domestic sources of demand to counter drag from external sector’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/enough-domestic-sources-of-demand-to-counter-drag-from-external-sector/articleshow/107372012.cms,"Do you think the

creates room for lower interest rates?

One of the issues that the Budget has flagged is the demographic challenge and opportunity and the societal change that is taking place. How do you view this?

Niti Aayog is working on the Viksit Bharat roadmap. What will be the focus areas?

You are as much a representative of the Centre as well as the states. Is it time to revisit the entire formula for transfers to states particularly on the issue of cesses and surcharges?

Suman Bery , who heads Niti Aayog , the govt think tank, is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China, which he says is also an opportunity for India. The economist is confident that Indian states remain resilient. Excerpts of the interview with TOI.The finance ministry expects the economy to grow 7% next year. Given the global situation, how do you see the prospects?The belief in the finance ministry is that we have a possible drag coming from the external sector but that we have other sources. We have enough domestic sources of demand. One has to applaud the political and economic judgment of FM in deciding that it was appropriate to pursue the path of fiscal consolidation. There is transparency. What this actually reflects is responsible economic management, which is one reason we are where we are. Second, it also creates a buffer so that there is policy space if we do encounter headwinds.That’s the hope and expectation. We have an independent central bank and an inflation targeting central bank, so it is up to the monetary policy committee to take a call through the monetary policy committee on the repo rate .The PM has said that when India grows its states grow. India is a composite of 37 states and UTs. They are each at very different points in their demographic transition. There are some states where the net replacement rate is down to 1%, like Kerala . There are others, particularly UP and Bihar, which are in their earliest stage of demographic transition and each one of these states is the size of a large European country. There are two implications of that — one is internal labour mobility and it will become an even larger part of our growth model. The govt has taken several steps to create a unified market. Our main endowment is our human capital and that has to be equipped to participate in global exchange in many ways. We know from China, Japan that the demographic dividend partly depends on markets and on human capital. But the golden period is fairly short lived, about 15 years, when the so called dependency ratio declines. The other big opportunity the PM has been highlighting is bringing women much more into the active labour force.When Niti was set up there was the idea of a three-year vision and a seven-year strategy paper. The reality is that schemes of govt tend to be aligned with the award of the Finance Commission . There are various established building blocks or hand holds which are already a matter of govt policy. The PM is much more interested in a national debate on what it means to be a Viksit Bharat or modern society. We have a collective goal and it is for the democratic polity to define what that goal should be. Its emphatically not for a super mandarin bureaucracy. It is not going to be Lee Kwan Yew’s Singapore led from the top.It’s entirely a finance ministry matter but I would be lying if I didn’t say when I visit certain states there is this complaint. A big frontier would be resource mobilisation at the state level. Second is going to be rationalisation of subsidies not only at the Union level, but also at the state level. All chief ministers sit on my governing council. When they convene as the governing council, I see them in their role as development practitioners. The world is beginning to appreciate quite how much institutional and political maturity India attained in our 75 years and the most fundamental dimension of a democracy, we have orderly transfers of power. There are enough buffers to ensure that what happens in state finances is unlikely to create macro instability. Those risks are well contained by our Constitution. The chief ministers know that they are going to be judged by development outcomes and so you can have the sugar rush of changing of pension plans or various handouts but if the cupboard is bare you are not going to be able to deliver.","Suman Bery is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China.

Government's Marathon to 2047: Emphasis on Fiscal Prudence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/governments-marathon-to-2047-emphasis-on-fiscal-prudence/articleshow/107371788.cms,"What was the thinking behind keeping the vote on account absolutely straight?

So is it the idea to keep the Budget completely transparent?

The capex has risen 11.1% and there is an emphasis on infrastructure spending. But there is also the hope that the private sector will now take over and start capital spending. Given the geopolitical situation, how confident is the govt that it will pan out as planned?

Finance secretary T V Somanathan, in an interview with TOI, says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047 . Excerpts:If you see the Budget speech you will see the emphasis on 2047. The govt has set its sight on running that marathon. Running to 2047 is a marathon , it’s not a sprint. If you are going to run a marathon, you need to be in good shape and you can’t have short-term stimulants or something that will get you some yards and then it’s done.The whole focus is on making India a developed country by 2047, for which a healthy present and a strong fiscal position is an important concomitant. Some purely short term measures don’t really fit into that picture. It’s a consistent picture: focus on the long term for which you need to build strength in the short term and that needs to be done by prudence in fiscal policy and by not doing things which can detract you from that path. Not doing the wrong thing is more important than appearing to do things.The idea is that govt finances may be good, bad or indifferent depending on the times, depending on the circumstances, depending on the policies. But what is the position should be reflected as reasonably and accurately as possible. That is an emphasis. As regards the Finance Commission, again the terms of reference that have been given to them are the terms in the Constitution.What is the means by which the devolution should be done is a matter they have full discretion. They can actually take all kinds of factors into account and in a sense we felt this time based on my review of the previous commissions that the right expression would be less is more. The shorter, less prescriptive terms of reference gives full scope for all stakeholders including state govts to express their viewpoints and for the commission to take a balanced view of the different perspectives and then come to its award. Ultimately the award of the Finance Commission is about devolution and grant for which full scope has now been given to them.n There are incipient signs of private capital expenditure accelerating. There are some surveys I have seen done by some of the chambers industry, which show high levels of investment. The PMI, which is a sort of leading indicator, is also looking pretty healthy. Capacity utilisation is one reason that private sector capital expenditure doesn’t immediately pick up when the economy starts accelerating because there is surplus capacity.But increasingly I get the sense that many industries are beginning to reach levels where they have to add capacity. When that happens capital investment will happen. Another pointer also mentioned in the Budget speech you may notice that our airlines have placed large orders for planes — that is capital expenditure.When you import 1,000 aircraft, it’s just not 1,000 aircraft, there are concomitant additions to ground handling facilities, you need airports to expand, you need to employ people to do that. That means a lot of jobs. The aircraft is capital but then look at the effect it is going to have on skilled jobs. So capital expenditure is happening. I am fairly confident that we will have decent capital expenditure in the year to come and that will become a new source of acceleration.",Finance secretary T V Somanathan says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047.

Income Tax Changes Budget 2024 : In the recent Budget 2024 speech, the Finance Minister kept the Section 80C tax deduction limit unchanged. The maximum limit for claiming tax benefits under Section 80C remains at Rs 1.5 lakh for the current fiscal year 2023-24 and will stay the same for individuals looking to save on taxes through Section 80C investments in the upcoming fiscal year 2024-25.Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions. Individuals can reduce their gross taxable income by up to Rs 1.5 lakh per financial year by engaging in these specific investments or expenditures.You can save on taxes through Section 80C by investing in things like Employees' Provident Fund (EPF), Public Provident Fund (PPF), Equity Linked Saving Scheme (ELSS) mutual funds, National Savings Certificate (NSC), and 5-year tax-saving fixed deposits with banks or post offices. Additionally, paying life insurance policy premiums also qualifies for tax benefits under Section 80C.It is important to note that each eligible investment comes with its specific maximum limit, rate of return, liquidity, and taxation rules for the earned returns, states ET in a report. For instance, the most you can invest in PPF in a financial year is Rs 1.5 lakh. Meanwhile, there's no limit on the amount you can invest in ELSS mutual funds, but the Section 80C deduction is capped at Rs 1.5 lakh.If individuals can't make specific investments, they can still get deductions under Section 80C from their gross taxable income through certain expenses. These expenses include repaying the principal amount of a home loan, tuition fees for children, payment of stamp duty, registration fees, and other costs related to buying a house.Since the financial year 2020-21, individuals without any business income must annually choose between the old and new tax regimes. As of the fiscal year 2023-24, the new tax regime is the default option. Consequently, individuals seeking tax deductions under Section 80C must opt for the old tax regime since this deduction isn't available in the new tax regime. It's crucial for taxpayers to be aware of these rules to make informed decisions about their tax planning and investment strategies.","Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget which is an interim budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year. The budget talks about inclusive development both, social and geographical, especially for youth, women, farmers, and the poor. Continued focus on improving logistics through infrastructure spend on roads, rail, airports, ports increases productivity for companies and citizens alike.To make ‘Viksit Bharat’ by 2047, the government’s focus is on improving and empowering people’s capabilities through various skilling initiatives. It is encouraging to see that Skill India Mission has succeeded in training more than 1.4 crore youth and upskilling and reskilling 54 lakh youth. I am particularly happy to see the continued focus on youth and women entrepreneurship and the announcement of a new fund which will give interest free 50 year loans for startups will provide a domestic fillip to startups supplementing venture capital we have traditionally relied on from abroad.PM Mudra Yojana has sanctioned 43 crore loans aggregating to 22.5 lakh crore to youth entrepreneurs and thirty crore Mudra Yojana loans to women entrepreneurs. There are several other schemes like Fund of Funds, Start-Up India, and Start-Up Credit Guarantee schemes that are assisting our youth. Further, the extension of tax benefits to Start-ups and investments made by sovereign wealth funds/pension funds, till 31st March 2025 depicts the government’s effort to support the startup eco- system.This aligns quite well with India Sanitation Coalition’s efforts to give impetus to the start-up world. Over the past 7 editions of our ISC-FICCI Sanitation Awards, we have recognized and promoted several start-ups in the sanitation space, many of whom are successful businesses now!While the finance minister did not provide detailed information on Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH), the budget allocation sees a slight increase in spend demonstrating continued focus on this highly successful program. The acknowledgement that the private sector has increasingly played a substantial role in addressing WASH issues in both urban and rural areas, with numerous projects underway through Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs), highlights the government's commitment to addressing challenges in this sector.A perfect example is the LightHouse Initiative initiated by the Department of Drinking Water along with the India Sanitation Coalition (ISC) by partnering with major corporates across India to develop model villages in Solid and Liquid Waste Management (SLWM) under SBM-Grameen. From this budget, there is an expectation that the government will persist in prioritizing Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) as the path toward achieving the country's Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6). Additionally, it is hoped that the government will uphold its commitment to making necessary infrastructural investments for SLWM.The budget speech rightly celebrates the fact that we have 83 lakh SHGs and 9 crore women beneficiaries. The microfinance movement in the country and the possibility of empowering women members of SHGs through livelihood skilling is a key to bringing women into mainstream economic advancement.The focus on green growth, rooftop solar, wind, biomass, e-vehicles all help with our green energy thrust. The tourism sector was mentioned and could be a huge job provider for youth and women.Guided by the principle ‘Reform, Perform, and Transform’, the budget emphasizes efficient implementation of various policies by improving coordination with states and relevant stakeholders. This is critical both for infra spend and social programsIt is noteworthy that ISC’s Climate Resilient Coastal Cities project which is being implemented in PPP (Public-Private Partnership) mode in four coastal states of Karnataka, Gujarat, Goa and Maharashtra is congruent with the government’s priority of promoting climate-resilient activities for the blue economy 2.0, a scheme for restoration and adaptation measures, and coastal aquaculture.The budget also focuses on the Aspirational districts program where assistance will be given to the states for faster development of aspirational districts and blocks, including the generation of ample economic opportunities. This is again very crucial as it has a huge potential to transform the landscape of our country while making sure no -one is left behind.Overall, this budget has embraced economic strategies and develops the building blocks that nurture and uphold growth, promote inclusive and sustainable development, and enhance productivity.","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year.

Finance Minister: Challenges Faced by New Finance Minister in Navigating Economic Uncertainty,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/challenges-faced-by-new-finance-minister-in-navigating-economic-uncertainty/articleshow/110855153.cms,"New Delhi: With the swearing-in of Narendra Modi’s council of ministers over, the question uppermost on everyone’s mind is who will be the next finance minister . Will Nirmala Sitharaman stay in the wood-paneled office on the first floor of North Block, which is home to the finance ministry, or will she move to another ministry on Raisina Hill.The task before the new FM is tough against the backdrop of a challenging geopolitical landscape. Sustaining growth , ensuring price stability and creating jobs by getting the private sector to invest are immediate priorities. Then there is the mammoth task of energy transition for Asia’s third largest economy that stares the new administration as climate challenges mount.The theme of sustaining growth and getting private investment going again is expected to run through the Budget that is likely to be presented next month as well as the 100-days agenda of the new govt and Modi’s third term as PM.While India remains on course to grow at over 7%, inflation has moderated although RBI governor Shaktikanta Das has cautioned that lowering it to 4% will not be so easy. Weatherproofing the farm sector against heatwaves and other weather shocks is a priority to keep the supply chain steady.The key focus is going to be investment, especially by the private sector. Following the interim Budget, Sitharaman had suggested that investment should not be measured in the traditional sectors alone but also in newer areas such as global capability centres, space and artificial intelligence. But economists and industry players still believe that there is no alternative to creating jobs in factories and manufacturing plants, especially at a time when the lack of adequate employment seems to have emerged as a major issue in the general elections. That may require govt to offer some incentives, which Indian industry is never averse to.Jobs and skilling are seen to be crucial, including in services such as tourism and hospitality. Govt will also need to address the issue of two-paced growth which economists and companies often talk about in the post-Covid period.While govt has been focusing on areas such as production-linked incentives, the FM will need to ensure that the schemes see actual payouts and the private sector is not left chasing officials and the administrative ministries to get the promised funds.Unlike the last two times, when BJP enjoyed absolute majority, this time the new FM will also have to be conscious of the political compulsions, which will include addressing demands of special category states from its two key allies as well as setting up the eighth pay commission to decide on salary revision for govt employees. Pay hikes for central govt staff are due in 2026, the year which will also see the implementation of the award of the 16th Finance Commission. Besides, there is the pending demand of assuring that the pension under NPS (new pension system) is at least half the last pay drawn. While Sitharaman had set up a committee headed by expenditure secretary T V Somanathan, the recommendations are yet to be submitted.Some of the recommendations will also require the Centre to mobilise resources, while sticking to the fiscal glide path that it has charted for itself. That may mean govt will have to revive its asset monetisation and disinvestment drives, something that was suspended ahead of general elections, while ensuring that allies are on board.Also on the agenda is the revamp of the seven-year-old GST regime which has multiple slabs, often creating classification issues.","The theme of sustaining growth and getting private investment going again is expected to run through the Budget that is likely to be presented next month.

TN goes global via Africa,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tn-goes-global-via-africa/articleshow/110853126.cms,"Africa is emerging as an investment destination for Tamil Nadu-based enterprises dealing in agriculture, IT, leather, textiles and auto ancillaries. But why?“Duty-free market access to the US for several products manufactured in the Sub-Saharan African region under the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), abundance of raw materials, and push by African nations to manufacture value-added products from natural resources to increase jobs for their citizens,” says Israr Ahmed, managing director, Farida Group. One of the early entrants in Africa, the Tamil Nadu-based company operates a leather tannery at Modjo in Ethiopia since 2010. It exports processed leather to several countries, including China and Japan. Several African nations also offer incentives to set up factories and are also potential markets. “Though there are umpteen positives, political vulnerability in some African countries is a major challenge that investors need to be cautious about,” he adds.The 55 nations in Africa have a combined GDP of about $3 trillion. The region has 60% of the world’s renewable energy assets and 50% of minerals essential for low-carbon technologies. Africa’s fresh produce market alone is expected to reach $1 trillion by 2030. Moreover, the continent is the second most populous after Asia with close to 150 crore people.This gives tremendous scope for investors to expand their business. B2B cross-border agri-trade startup Hectar Global, which entered the African market in 2023, is setting up subsidiaries in four countries — Benin, Ghana, Ivory Coast and Togo. These subsidiaries will procure agriculture commodities, including cashew, soya bean and pulses, for shipping to India and southeast Asia. While these subsidiaries are set to generate `250 crore revenue within a year of commencing operations, the Chennai-headquartered company expects the African market to contribute about 25% of its revenue by 2027.“There is a lot of misconception about investing in African countries. In fact, they want operations to be run on a professional scale. Such a welcoming scenario gives space for SMEs like us to venture into the market for business expansion and growth,” says Srinath Srinivasan, CEO, Hectar Global.Chennai-based technology provider for global food chains, CENSANEXT, tech subsidiary of WayCool (a food and agri-tech platform), has also forayed into the African market. With opportunities driven by the continent’s growing agricultural sector and pressing need for technological solutions to enhance productivity and efficiency, the company is targeting around $8 million-$10 million business. Having customers in Morocco and Kenya, it is looking to enter Uganda, Ethiopia, South Africa and Nigeria. Avinash Kasinathan, CEO, CENSANEXT, says small and medium-sized companies from India can tap into the African market leveraging their agility, innovation and expertise to address the diverse needs of the continent’s rapidly growing economies.With the growth in commerce and trade, the Asian African Chamber of Commerce & Industry (AACCI) launched its Tamil Nadu chapter, three weeks ago in Chennai. G D Singh, AACCI founder & chairman, says 600-800 companies from India have a presence in Africa with a collective investment of $14 billion. Of them, 10% are from Tamil Nadu, spread over IT/ITES, textiles, manufacturing, agriculture, auto ancillary, leather and food processing sectors. “After catering to the domestic market, enterprises need to enter into virgin territory for growth. Africa being virgin territory suits most of the Tamil Nadu-based enterprises. The appetite for taking risks is more despite the challenges of foreign exchange. There are even outlets serving Tamil food in Africa,” he adds.Africa-Tamil Nadu trade registered a milestone five decades back when Ashok Leyland commenced exports in 1974. Currently, the leading manufacturer of commercial vehicles (CVs) in India and the fourth largest manufacturer of buses in the world, exports CVs to 35 countries in Africa. Amandeep Singh, president, LCV, Ashok Leyland, says, “Africa offers a large and growing market for CVs due to rapidly developing infrastructure. Our vehicles have been designed to perform in the tough conditions in Africa. We also formed strategic alliance with govts to execute their public transportation services.”TVS Motor Company also exports a range of models to different parts of Africa. While pharmaceutical companies started exports to Africa in the 1990s, other sectors, including engineering goods and textiles, gradually joined.Now, industries have started setting up their units. For instance, a fully integrated garment manufacturing company in Coimbatore, KPR Mill, launched a production facility in Ethiopia in 2019. More projects in various sectors are in the pipeline. Digital transformation and cloud solutions company, Novac Technology Solutions, is entering South Africa this year. This will help the firm tap the technology market in 10 African countries in multiple sectors such as finance, insurance, retail and digital learning. Nanda Kishore N S, CEO, Novac Technology Solutions, says its first client in South Africa is in the insurance sector.",The 55 nations in Africa have a combined GDP of about $3 trillion.

The amendment does not have a retrospective effect, held the ITAT bench and declined to set aside the order of the Commissioner (Appeals), who had treated the non-compete fees of Rs. 10 crore received by Lyka Labs (a company engaged in manufacture and sale of bulk formulation of pharmaceutical products) as a capital receipt.

Lyka Labs had as per an agreement dated March 12, 2002 entered into a non-compete agreement with its joint venture company Lyka Hetro Health Care Limited (LHHCL) for not competing with LHHCL in the marketing, distribution and selling activities of certain formulations for the trade mark which has been registered or used by it.

Both Lyka Labs and the Commissioner (Appeals) relied on an earlier order given by the Supreme Court in the case of Guffic Chem. The apex had categorically held that the amendment is only with effect from April 1, 2003 (Assessment year 2004-05 onwards) and does not have a retrospective effect for taxing the non-compete fee received prior to the said period.

The Supreme Court in this order had also distinguished the compensation received for termination/loss of agency and a loss of source of business as per a negative covenant where the former would be a ‘revenue receipt’ and the latter a ‘capital receipt’. There is no doubt that the agreement entered into by Lyka Labs and LHHCL was a negative covenant. Accordingly, the ITAT bench dismissed the appeal filed by the I-T department.

Domestic open access solar capacity addition doubles to 1.8 GW in Jan-Mar: Mercom,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/domestic-open-access-solar-capacity-addition-doubles-to-1-8-gw-in-jan-mar-mercom/articleshow/110834961.cms,"NEW DELHI: Open access solar installations rose two-fold in India to 1.8 gigawatts during January-March this year supported by several factors, including reduced module cost , US-based Mercom Capital has said. Solar power through open access is an arrangement where a power producer establishes a solar power plant to supply green energy to consumers.

India added over 1.8 gigawatts (GW) of solar open access capacity in the first quarter of the calendar year of 2024, posting a two-fold increase from 909.3 megawatts (MW) in Q4 2023, the report titled 'Mercom India Solar Open Access Market' said.

As of March 2024, the cumulative installed solar open access capacity stood at 14.3 GW.

Solar open access developers benefited from lower Chinese module prices and the suspension of the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM) order for projects commissioned through March 2024.

Additionally, lower power purchase agreement (PPA) prices, due to reduced project costs, further incentivized consumers to adopt solar open access.

""Demand for green energy open access, especially solar, has been mounting, driven by the financial savings and initiatives to add renewable energy in the power procurement mix.

""An additional push comes from the corporates leading climate change mitigation strategies. If not for the regulatory restrictions, green energy open access could be the driving force that helps India meet its non-fossil fuel targets,"" said Priya Sanjay, Managing Director at Mercom India.

In Q1 2024, Rajasthan led solar open access capacity additions, accounting for almost 28 per cent followed by Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra with 21 per cent and 12 per cent of capacity additions, respectively.

The pipeline of solar open access projects under development and in the pre-construction phase was over 18 GW as of March 2024. Almost 74 per cent of pipeline projects were in Karnataka, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, and Andhra Pradesh.","Solar power through open access is an arrangement where a power producer establishes a solar power plant to supply green energy to consumers.

From May 1 to June 10, the city has seen 32 days when the temperature has been above 40 degrees Celsius. This is the highest number of days in 14 years.From May 14 to June 10, the city has continuously seen temperatures above 40 degrees Celsius for 28 days. This too is the highest number of days in 14 years.This was clear from IMD data, gathered by TOI.As a comparison, 2023 and 2022 saw 10 and 27 days, respectively, when the maximum temperature crossed 40 degrees Celsius during the same period.The IMD’s data available in the public domain from 2011 onwards. It shows that before 2024, no year saw the maximum temperature crossing 40 degrees Celsius consecutively for 28 days.Even the number of such days in this streak will increase as mercury is predicted to stay above 40 degrees Celsius for the next seven days.Delhi has seen intense heat this summer. Between May 1 and June 10 this year, some stations, such as Narela, Najafgarh, Pitampura, Mungeshpur and Jafarpur, recorded the mercury consistently above 45.Most weather records were broken on May 28 and 29 as many stations saw peak temperatures. The highest maximum temperature at Safdarjung was 46.8 degrees Celsius on May 29.However, Narela and Mungeshpur recorded a maximum of 49.9 degrees Celsius each on May 28, which is the highest ever recorded in Delhi. Pitampura and Pusa saw 49.8 and 49, respectively.IMD’s data shows that this current spell of intense heat is more severe than 2013 when mercury crossed 40 degrees Celsius for 31 days.Experts said scanty rainfall this summer led to a high temperature. However, only 0.4 mm rainfall was logged on May 11 and May this year ended with a rain deficit of 99%. In June so far, Safdarjung has received 1.2mm rainfall and is staring at a rain deficit of 85%.“In the absence of significant rain activity, Delhi has seen clear skies, which cause the surface heating up faster. On most days, westerly dry and warm winds have prevailed in the city. These winds, from Rajasthan and south Haryana that are also recording high mercury, cause the temperature to rise,” a Met official said.“In the past years, rain would bring down the temperature to below 40 degrees Celsius and would provide respite to Delhiites from a spell of blistering heat. For instance, last year, the city logged excess rain — March (206%), April (23%), May (262%) and June (37%). Since no intense rain is expected in the next seven days, the mercury is expected to stay on a higher side,” the Met official said.","From May 1 to June 10, the city has seen 32 days when the temperature has been above 40 degrees Celsius.

""Therefore, it would be surprising if his presser altered our subjective odds of a cut in September.""","US Federal Reserve is likely to keep interest rates unchanged this week, but could pare back the number of cuts it has penciled in for this year.

The so-called continuing claims tracking those who collect benefits beyond the first week increased 2,000 to a seasonally adjusted 1.792 million during the week ending May 25, the claims report said.

The recent data showed US job openings in April fell more than expected and the number of available jobs per job-seeker reached its lowest level since June 2021.

Meanwhile, the employers announced the fewest job cuts last month since December and layoff announcements so far in 2024 are running behind last year's pace, according to data from outplacement firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas.

For the analyst Adrian Jones , the mission of wealth generation is clear. The analyst was able to predict Bitcoin's new all-time high, and now, as he enjoys his astounding gains, he has set his eyes on another target: Cosmic Kittens ( CKIT ). As he shares his prediction, the crypto world seems to be in a frenzy as people follow in his footsteps and delve into the feline GameFi project’s presale.But what makes a new entrant so good that the expert is putting his weight behind the new token? Let’s deep dive into Cosmic Kittens, the project, and what it brings to the world.GameFi, the amalgam of Game and Finance, is a bustling crypto sector that has changed how modern games are built and played. Look back at your childhood and take any game you loved to play. All the coins collected, points made, and high scores were eventually of no use. After you were done with the game, you simply moved on, and that effort and progress you made was wasted.GameFi changed all that. By merging crypto and entertainment, players earn real tokens, which (while having the same in-game properties of purchasing power) can be sold and traded on different crypto exchanges. According to GameFi aggregator DeGame, Q1 of 2024 has seen the sector trade over $1.1 billion in volume, showcasing that there is more to come.1This means that Cosmic Kittens is entering the market at a time when there is a clear and increasing demand for good games that catch the eye and Cosmic Kittens does that pretty well.As the name suggests, Cosmic Kittens is all about cats and the cosmos—Cosmo Kittania, to be exact. It is a different universe where cats have achieved space flight and now explore the vast universe. As they travel, they need resources, gathering materials needed for their survival.Gamers take charge of the cats, becoming their owners. Intelligent as the cats are, they rely on their owners to take care of them. This means users will need to interact with their pets frequently, ensuring they are fed and get sufficient exercise. Furthermore, owners can also start a lineage, mating their cats with others to produce a cute litter of kittens.Does this sound familiar? The pet/owner relationship echoes past crazes such as Tamagotchi, where players took care of their pets on small digital devices. The breeding part is inspired by games such as Pokemon and Digimon.Unlike other games in the blockchain industry, Cosmic Kittens’ users are on a journey of exploration that creates a bond with their digital pets.All the cats in the Cosmic Kittens game are represented as NFTs. That means pet owners are truly owners who have control over their feline partners, not the game developers. With the NFTs, users are free to trade their cats, flipping profits as they develop and enhance their pets.But with the breeding element, Cosmic Kittens takes another leap. Gamers can mate their feline friends and produce litters of cute furry kittens. The best part is that these new kittens take on different attributes of their parents, creating unique combinations that can range from common to rare. Thus, players can fastrack their journey with the kittens or make profits by selling them off in the marketplace.The Cosmic Kittens gameplay and ecosystem are underpinned by its CKIT token. The token can be used to purchase in-game items or different decor for the cats, like sunglasses, clothes, or even upgrading their abilities. On the other hand, users can cash out when players sell extra resources or their cats in the dedicated marketplace.CKIT tokens also help users get early VIP access to planned activities, such as special edition cats, art drops, and more. As the Cosmic Kittens ecosystem develops, more and more VIP services will be launched, making CKIT tokens the gateway token.As such, crypto is expected to be in extreme demand, especially once it is made available to the general public. As of now, it is available only in its upcoming presale. Crypto enthusiasts understand the event’s importance and like the Adrian Jones who has predicted a 50x gain, many are already signed up.Standing at the crossroads of gaming, NFTs, and explosive growth, Cosmic Kittens is a crypto project that is the talk of the town. The deflationary CKIT token is available in limited quantity during its presale, so if you want to take the plunge for better chances of wealth generation and hours of gameplay, the suggestion is you book your slot today before it’s too late!","Cosmic Kittens (CKIT) is a feline GameFi project.
