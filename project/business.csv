Gold import duty cut: Why Indians may not find buying gold from Dubai as attractive post Budget 2024,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-import-duty-cut-why-indians-may-not-find-buying-gold-from-dubai-as-attractive-post-budget-2024/articleshow/112097671.cms,"Gold import duty cut in Budget 2024: The recent reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai. Indian jewellers with stores in both India and the UAE believe that the narrowed duty differential will result in lower gold prices in India, making it less attractive for Indians to purchase gold in Dubai.The emirate had attracted gold-enthusiast Indians following a steep rise in customs duty in India in July 2022. In the fiscal 2024-25 budget, the duty on gold imports was more than halved.The duty cut is also expected to boost gold jewellery production in India, particularly the popular 'Kolkatti' jewellery from Kolkata, which is favored by Indian expats in Dubai and tourists from various countries. This move will encourage gold artisans to create new designs in both heavyweight and lightweight jewellery, attracting consumers to purchase gold from India.According to an ET report, Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group , estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India as Indian tourists who previously bought jewellery in Dubai will now prefer to shop in India. However, Indian expats living in Dubai and other customers may continue to buy from the UAE.Also Read | Gold losing sheen?

He points out that the labour cost is significantly lower in India, and with the introduction of mandatory hallmarking and HUID numbers, the purity of gold in India is no longer a concern.Furthermore, NRIs in Dubai do not receive VAT refunds, and Indians travelling abroad only receive about 60% of the VAT back on their gold purchases. Gold trade analyst Bhargav Baidya suggests that the 1% duty differential between gold jewellery in India and Dubai will be offset by Indian jewellers offering discounts to retain and attract customers.Saurabh Gadgil, chairman of PNG Jewellers, notes that Indian import duty is now on par with the US, allowing Indian jewellers to offer competitive prices compared to other countries worldwide. The reduced customs duty is expected to make gold purchases in India more attractive and convenient for Indian consumers, potentially leading to a significant shift in their gold shopping preferences.",The reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai.

Digital push is driving out mid-level banking staff: RBI,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/digital-push-is-driving-out-mid-level-banking-staff-rbi/articleshow/112121208.cms,"MUMBAI: The digital decade has triggered a major shift in jobs in the financial sector . With most clerical work being automated, middle and lower-end jobs are disappearing.The ratio of officers to support staff has changed from 50:50 in FY11 to 74:26 in FY23 (see graphic), indicating lower opportunities for middle-tier jobs. AI is seen to be upending more jobs in the sector.RBI governor Shaktikanta Das said that the increased usage of digital channels will create HR challenges in financial services, requiring lenders to invest in upskilling and reskilling staff.The governor's observation comes in a foreword to the central bank's Report on Currency and Finance, which focuses on digitalisation. ""Digitalisation is decentralising financial labour through outsourcing and telework. Automation replacing labour can potentially widen the gap between capital and labour returns, creating a fragmented labour market with low-skill/low-pay and high-skill/high-pay jobs, while middle-tier jobs are displaced by technology,"" the report said.The report notes that globally, between 2013 and 2019, employees in support roles in the financial sector decreased in many countries while the number of professionals and technicians rose. ""This is evident in the Indian banking sector as well,"" the report said.The report flags the high turnover of over 30% in private banks in FY23, where hiring was made over digital platforms. ""The rising importance of AI-related skills in the labour market in India is reflected in the growth in AI talent recruitment relative to overall recruitment in 2023 (16.8%) and the highest relative AI skill penetration rate,"" the report said.Even when it comes to upskilling, RBI notes several challenges. Pre-existing traditional learning & development methods are inadequate for the current transformation, requiring significant investments to build up the required skills. In 2023, after top private banks reported that nearly third of their staff had to be replaced after quitting, the central bank had expressed concern over the churn level. At that time, banks had clarified that the churn was in the frontline field staff.According to RBI, India is at the forefront of the digital revolution and the Indian digital economy is poised to constitute a fifth of the GDP by 2026 from 10% currently. Das in his foreword said that digitalisation is paving the way for next-gen banking and improving access to financial services at affordable costs.RBI also noted that the cost of a data breach in India has risen 28% to $2 million between FY20 and FY23.

Cipla saw a 7% revenue increase to Rs 6,694 crore and an almost 18% rise in net profit to Rs 1,178 crore for Q1 FY25, bolstered by strong India and US markets. While branded prescriptions in India grew 10%, North America achieved its highest quarterly revenue at $250 million.

Desert, drone and drugs from Pak: Why Rajasthan is the new Punjab

The Border Security Force (BSF) struggled to patrol Rajasthan's border with Pakistan due to understaffing and technological challenges. Despite occasional successes in intercepting drug-laden drones and arresting culprits, drug smuggling continued to grow. Local and collaborative efforts were implemented, but adaptation by smugglers and rising addiction complicated the situation. Additional measures were urgently needed.

Torrent Pharma posts 21% rise in Q1 net profit

Torrent Pharmaceuticals Limited reported a 21% increase in consolidated net profit for the June quarter of FY 2024-25, reaching Rs 457 crore. Revenue rose by 10% to Rs 2,859 crore.

New Delhi: Regulatory scrutiny in the US has cast a dark cloud on approvals for new drugs from domestic generic biggies in the world’s most lucrative pharma market .ANDA (abbreviated new drug application) by the USFDA (US Food and Drug Administration) witnessed a subdued first quarter in FY25, with aggregate approvals for major companies falling to the lowest levels in last eight quarters, analysts told TOI.ANDAs are critically important for domestic pharma companies as they provide a pathway to access the US market as well as boost their revenues.Major companies, including Cipla and Sun Pharma, continued to struggle with regulatory issues and were able to secure only a few approvals, an analyst at BNP Paribas said. New approvals for Aurobindo Pharma fell to the lowest level in the last seven quarters due to regulatory issue at Unit III manufacturing facility of its subsidiary Eugia Pharma.Major companies like Cipla, Aurobindo, Dr Reddy’s, Lupin and Sun Pharma are facing USFDA scrutiny, ranging from inspections and warning letters over the last year. ANDAs are used to seek approval from the USFDA to market a generic version of an already approved ‘reference’ drug.The US business for most companies is expected to grow around 2-4% quarter on quarter and around 8% y-o-y, driven by stability in pricing and new launches, a note from ICICI said. The launch of generic Revlimid, a blockbuster cancer drug, is an upside to companies, such as Dr Reddy’s Labs, Zydus, Cipla, Sun Pharma and Aurobindo. Further, Lupin’s revenues received a shot in the arm with generic Sprivia, a key respiratory drug, while generic Mirabegron, a medication to treat an overactive bladder, will also be a growth driver.Overall revenues of the companies are expected to grow at a modest pace of 9% y-o-y.

NPS and EPF: Overlapping services

What is NPS Vatsalaya?

Latest NPS rules, news: In the Union Budget 2024 speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced two new initiatives with regard to National Pension Scheme (NPS) - extension of NPS 14% employer contribution benefits to private setcor and the intended launch of NPS Vatsalya.Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries, bringing it at par with the provisions available for government employees.Sriram Iyer, CEO, HDFC Pension Management told ET that with this move the “ground rules have been harmonised among government and non-government employees, which is a positive step.”Effectively, this means that now, private-sector employees can choose to reduce the taxable portion of employers’ contribution to their NPS corpus, thereby paying less tax and leaving greater funds in their pension deposits.“Employees will benefit from tax savings . More importantly, the 40% increase in contribution will have a significant impact on the terminal value of the retirement corpus,” remarked Iyer. The extended savings will “help in retirement planning, working as an option that is at par with the Provident Fund,” Dinesh Rohira, CEO & Founder, 5nance.com was quoted as saying.Moreover, the endeavour aims to increase NPS penetration by increasing tax incentives for the private sector, providing them a social security-cushion post-retirement.The scheme’s motive to widen the NPS subscriber base may not prove to be flawlessly effective, however. This is explained by Agrees Mrin Agarwal, Founder, Finsafe India: “While it’s good that the limit has been raised, it may not increase adoption as employees need to be educated in a big way. Also, the benefit is only for the salaried opting for the new tax regime,” she says.The mandatory contribution to the EPF, too, threatens to relegate the provisions of NPS under the umbrella of near-superfluity. This sentiment is echoed by Varun Sahay, a software engineer in a Delhi-based IT company: “When 12% of my salary is already deducted for the EPF, why should I put in more in the NPS and cut my take-home pay?”Rohira feels otherwise. “There’s no competition between the NPS and EPF as employees can contribute to both and build a 3-4 times bigger corpus while earning 3-4% higher returns via marketlinked options in the NPS,” he counters.Also Check | New Tax Regime 2023 vs 2024 After Budget: How Much Income Tax Will Salaried Taxpayers Save & How Do New Tax Slabs Compare To Old Regime? Top 10 Points You Must Know To jumpstart retirement savings for children, a new initiative called NPS Vatsalya has been unveiled in the Budget. This scheme allows parents and guardians to contribute to a minor's account, which can be converted into a regular NPS account once the child reaches adulthood.""It provides a very long duration for reaping the compounding benefits and accumulating a huge bounty at a later age. This can be a good way to plan a better future for kids who may not opt for a service segment in the future,"" says Rohira. Sriram Iyer agrees, stating, ""It’s a good move to help the child start his retirement journey. Even if a parent starts when the child is 10 years old, by the time he starts working, it can be a solid foundation for the compounding journey after that.""However, some experts question the utility of a product with such a long lock-in period, especially when parents cannot use the funds for essential goals like their child’s education amidst soaring education costs of 11-12%.""Parents are struggling to save for their own retirement, so it might be a bit of a stretch to expect them to save for their kids’ retirement.

Though the NPS permits partial withdrawals, it allows only 25% of the corpus after three years of joining, and this can be done only three times during the entire tenure. A premature exit before 60 years with 100% withdrawal is only possible if the corpus is less than Rs.2.5 lakh, an amount insufficient for most children's goals.""In its current form, there won’t be any uptake,"" asserts Agarwal. Rohira concurs, ""It’s a vanilla product with a lock-in, which does not make it very attractive and it may not take off. However, the government may optimise it and introduce new features later."" Iyer adds, ""This is just a start and there may be more subscriber-friendly features as we take it to the market. The regulator is proactive and open to feedback.""","Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries.

Gold losing sheen? The government has reduced its target for issuing gold bonds in the financial year 2024-25 by 38% compared to the previous interim budget goal, according to a senior official. The revised target stands at Rs 18,500 crore, down from Rs 29,638 crore estimated in the interim budget and Rs 26,852 crore (revised estimate) in 2023-24.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told ET ""The decision followed a reassessment of various factors, including investor demand, other investment products and uncertainties around the global economy, as the situation has changed since the interim budget in February.""After accounting for redemptions, the net issuances of sovereign gold bonds are now estimated at Rs 15,000 crore for this fiscal year, a significant decrease from the Rs 26,138 crore projected in the interim budget and Rs 25,352 crore in the revised estimate for 2023-24.Harish Galipelli, director at ILA Commodities India, attributed this shift to retail investors increasingly opting for equities in anticipation of better returns. He also noted that people are uncertain about the potential for further increases in gold prices in the short-to-medium term following a recent rally. Additionally, Galipelli pointed out that savings in rural areas have been impacted by retail inflation and other factors.The gold bond and gold monetisation schemes were introduced by the government in late 2015 to discourage the physical purchase of precious metals and reduce imports, thereby mitigating the negative impact on the current account deficit.The gross collection through these two schemes is now projected to be Rs 20,030 crore in 2024-25, compared to Rs 31,168 crore in the interim budget and Rs 28,240 crore (revised estimate) in the previous fiscal year. Similarly, the net collection is estimated at Rs 16,433 crore, down from Rs 27,571 crore in the interim budget and Rs 26,653 crore in the previous year.

Both schemes were designed to curb gold imports, which, along with crude oil, have been significant contributors to India's current account deficit.

Budget 2024 new NPS benefits: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has announced additional tax benefits for salaried taxpayers investing in the National Pension Scheme . The Union Budget has taken steps to promote retirement planning by enhancing the tax advantage on NPS contributions and introducing a new option for minor children in the pension system .The deduction under Section 80CCD(2) is set to be raised from 10% to 14% of the basic salary. This section permits you to contribute up to 10% of your basic pay to NPS tax-free. Previously, only government employees were eligible for the 14% deduction, but now this benefit has been extended to the private sector as well.“It is proposed to increase the amount of deduction allowed to an employer in respect of his contribution to a pension scheme referred to in section 80CCD, from the extent of 10% to the extent of 14% of the salary of the employee. Further, a non-government employee in the new tax regime shall be allowed deduction of an amount not exceeding 14% of the employee’s salary in place of 10%,” the Budget speech document reads.Also Check | Latest income tax slabs FY 2024-25 For instance, if your basic salary is Rs 1 lakh, your employer can contribute Rs 10,000 (10% of basic pay) to the NPS on your behalf, which is exempt from tax.

Previously, only government employees were eligible for the 14% deduction, but it has now been extended to the private sector as well.As is evident from the table, if your basic pay is Rs 25,000 per month, then the additional tax saved is Rs 624. At a basic pay of Rs 1 lakh per month, the additional tax benefit is almost Rs 10,000 and at high basic pay levels of Rs 6 lakh, the extra tax saving would be over Rs 1 lakh!""The NPS proposals in the budget take significant steps towards the government's goal of making India a pensioned society by 2047,"" Sriram Iyer, CEO of HDFC Pension was quoted as saying by ET.While the new tax regime offers the NPS benefit only under Section 80CCD (2), the old tax regime allows three deductions under Sections 80CCD (1) (Rs 1.5 lakh), 80CCD (1B) (Rs 50,000) and 80CCD (2). However, the higher limit of 14% is only for those who opt for the new tax regime.""With the employers' contribution increasing to 14%, employees will have extended savings now.

(The author is Partner – Infrastructure, EY India)

Budget 2024 : India's Economic Survey for 2024 revealed the country's infrastructure leap. FY24 capital expenditure has seen almost threefold increase from FY20 with concerted efforts to boost physical connectivity, electricity, water and sanitation, urban development, strategic and digital infrastructure. It also marked emphasis on resource mobilisation from new sources and data aggregation and management for tracking projects and optimal allocation of scarce resources.While capital allocation for major infrastructure sub-sectors like roads, railways, etc. continues as already announced by the government during the interim Budget, the current final Budget heralds a transformative vision for the eastern states with the ‘Purvodaya’ plan, targeting holistic growth with announcements of new roads, power plant, airports, colleges and sports infrastructure.For the shipping sector, the government has announced ownership, leasing and flagging reforms which should improve the share of the Indian shipping industry and generate more employment.Capital projects in the sector uplifts the society at large and generates employment. Brownfield redevelopment of cities and houses for the poor will fuel demand in the sector thereby generating employment and economic growth. Additionally, the government has announced an employment incentive scheme for first time employers to further fillip jobs creation and youth empowerment.From a tax standpoint, the government recognised the potential of cruise tourism in India and in order to give a fillip to this employment generating industry, a simplified tax regime where 20 percent of revenues will be deemed as income from such business will be considered for the purpose of income-tax.India has recognised the need to have a robust MRO ecosystem for the airline and boat & ship sector in view of increased demand. From Customs perspective, the period for export of goods which are imported for repairs and requirement to re-import goods which are exported for repairs under warranty has been extended.The government recognises the need for participation from the private sector in this critical sector including investments from foreign investors. Deletion of angel tax provision is a welcome move which will propel raising of funds in the sector.Second round of VSV gives opportunity to minimise litigation with focus on ease of doing business.On an overall basis, this year’s Budget lays down a framework to propel growth and generate employment with higher involvement of the private sector in upskilling India and some relaxation for individual taxpayers."," FY24 capital expenditure has seen almost threefold increase from FY20.

This, in turn, led to under reporting of income. These individuals offered the overseas income net of tax and at the same time claimed a foreign tax credit (FTC) for taxes withheld overseas against their India tax liability.In short - they got a double advantage.The Budget proposes to amend section 198 of the I-T Act to include income taxes paid outside India for the purpose of computing the income of the taxpayer who is liable to tax in India. This proposal will be effective financial year 2024-25.Parizad Sirwalla, partner and head (global mobility services tax) at KPMG India, said, ""The amendment is more clarificatory in nature.

The opposition offensive against the Budget seeks to paint the governing party as beholden to its demanding allies TDP and JDU from Andhra and Bihar at the cost of others. The tactic clearly seeks to put BJP on the defensive on major turfs where it will be fighting elections soon - Haryana, Maharashtra, Jharkhand, or in states where BJP is seeking expansion of its political footprint, like TN, Kerala, Telangana.Rahul Gandhi Wednesday briefed 20 party MPs chosen to participate in the LS discussion. Sources said Rahul specifically told the members to focus on what their respective states have not got in the Budget, rather than speaking about what others have got. The party decided to accommodate maximum states through MPs in its allocated four hours discussion time. The choice of Haryana veteran Kumari Selja as the lead speaker and then Praniti Shinde of Maharashtra was to showcase the election states. Also, the focus of opposition's criticism is on unemployment, farmers, price rise - issues which are politically sensitive, as also how govt has ""picked"" various announcements from Congress election manifesto.The aggression against ""discrimination"" is going to be incessant during the ongoing Parliament session.

Budget 2024: Big Relief To Indian Taxpayers | Changes In New Regime Slabs | Nirmala Sitharaman

NEW DELHI: Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Wednesday said most people will be better off under the new capital gains tax structure, despite the indexation benefit being withdrawn for property, and asserted that govt decided on the new structure after undertaking an elaborate exercise.“This perception that you will be at a disadvantage is not realistic, it’s absolutely not correct… In almost every case people have a lower tax burden under this system.The small or the medium people who are going into the market or property investments are going to benefit from it,” she told TOI in an interview.On Tuesday, she had announced a reduction in long term capital gains tax on property and gold from 20% to 12.5%, while withdrawing the benefit to adjust it for inflation. This came with the provision that indexation benefit will be available for properties bought up to 2001.The FM said the amendments have been proposed with the intent to simplify the tax regime and bring all asset classes at par.Sitharaman said the Union Budget presented on Tuesday was a continuation of the interim budget and insisted that the measures announced for Andhra Pradesh were part of the commitments given at the time of bifurcation of the state . “In Bihar’s case can anyone deny the devastation that happens because of Kosi flooding?” she said.She also said that the skilling plan through internship was voluntary for companies and she had received suggestions for such a scheme from various industry bodies. “We're not forcing anybody, we've had a lot of discussion with CII and Ficci and they thought it is possible to do it. It will actually help because they will have industry-ready people, who can be employed.”She hit out at the Opposition, saying, “This brazen method of building a false narrative, repeating it and restating it with the hope that it will stick has been tried in the Lok Sabha elections. They are trying it even now.”Along with the calculations released by the Central Board of Direct Taxes under different scenarios, tax authorities said, “Nominal real estate returns are generally in the region of 12-16% per annum, much higher than inflation. The indexation for inflation in in the region of 4-5%, depending on the period of holding. Therefore, substantial tax savings are expected for a vast majority of taxpayers.”The statement further said that the new regime is beneficial for five-year old properties under the new regime which have seen an appreciation of 1.7 times or more. Similarly, for 10 years, if the value rises 2.4 times the new mechanism is seen to be beneficial. Ditto for property purchased in 2009-10 with appreciation of 4.9 times or more, the tax department said.“It's only where returns are low (less than about 9-11% per annum) that the earlier tax rate is beneficial, but such low returns in real estate are unrealistic and rare (less than 10% of cases),” it said.Revenue secretary Sanjay Malhotra told TOI that benefits of reinvesting the capital gains in a new property and parking the funds in tax-exempt 54EC bonds issued by REC are intact.Asked about the revenue impact, he said that the Centre may end up losing revenue as most taxpayers are likely to gain from the decision.“Simplification of any tax structure has benefits of ease of compliance, including computation filing, maintenance of records. This also removes the differential rates for various asset classes,” CBDT said.","Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman says most people will be better off under the new capital gains tax structure.

Who loses or gains from this Budget's LTCG tax change?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/who-loses-or-gains-from-this-budgets-ltcg-tax-change/articleshow/112122045.cms,"Are you feeling worried that the Budget has increased the tax on capital gains from stocks and equity funds? While the higher tax will certainly be a damper for investors with large portfolios, those with smaller portfolios may actually gain from the proposed change. If the long-term capital gains from stocks and equity funds are up to Rs 2 lakh in a financial year, your tax liability will now be lower.That's because even though the tax rate for long-term gains has been hiked from 10% to 12.5%, the exemption threshold has also been raised from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 1.25 lakh.This increase in exemption means those with gains of Rs 1.25 lakh in a year will save Rs 2,600 in tax. This gain in tax progressively reduces as the gains increase. However, even investors with gains of up to Rs 2 lakh in a year will pay less tax. The inflection point comes at Rs 2.25 lakh. If the gains exceed Rs 2.25 lakh in a year, the tax liability will be higher than before (see table).One way investors can avoid the tax is by harvesting tax-free long-term gains of up to Rs 1.25 lakh every financial year. Sell some of your stocks and equity funds purchased more than a year ago so that the gains are within the Rs 1.25 lakh tax-free threshold. The same securities and funds can be repurchased immediately thereafter. This simple exercise will not only help you pocket tax-free long-term capital gains but also reset the purchase price of the securities at a higher level, thus reducing the tax when you sell these shares at a future date. Do this even if you intend to hold your equity investments for the long term.Investors should ensure that they maintain the equity allocation in the portfolio when they harvest long-term gains. Selling off equity investments and not repurchasing them might change your asset mix and leave you with a lower than desired equity exposure.Though investors with long-term capital gains have the opportunity to avoid tax, those with short-term gains have no solace. The Budget has increased the tax on short-term gains from 15% to 20%. For every Rs 1 lakh gain, the investor will shell out an additional tax of Rs 5,200. Arguably, this is not a negative step, because the higher tax will make short-term trading and speculation less attractive and discourage punters and day traders. It could also make investors take a longer term view and remain invested for at least one year to escape the high tax.The author isManaging Director of MyMoneyMantra.com.

Reports swirled on Sunday that Vice President Kamala Harris made a surprise video appearance at Comic-Con during a "" Simpsons "" panel. According to these reports, 'Simpsons' creator Matt Groening introduced a clip featuring Harris, describing it as coming from a super fan.The video reportedly showed Harris quoting a popular "" Treehouse of Horror "" episode — the beloved ""Simpsons"" Halloween special — which centered around the 1996 presidential election between then-President Bill Clinton and Republican nominee Bob Dole.This sparked excitement and speculation among fans, with many believing that the video was a new creation, made specifically for Comic-Con.The clip generated buzz, as people began to say that 'The Simpsons' had once again predicted the future, referencing Harris' current political prominence and presidential ambitions.However, sources close to the show have clarified the truth behind the video. The clip, while authentic, is not a new production, as per the report by TMZ. It was recorded years ago and has resurfaced in light of the current political climate and Harris' ongoing campaign efforts. The video was not created specifically for this year's Comic-Con event.This revelation comes as Harris embarks on an extensive campaign blitz, particularly targeting Gen Z voters. Following her emergence as the presumptive Democratic nominee after Joe Biden, she has been utilizing various platforms to reach potential voters and solidify her position against Donald Trump.With just over 100 days left before the election, Harris is determined to connect with the electorate and showcase why she believes she is the right choice for the presidency. The resurfaced 'Simpsons' clip, while intriguing, is part of a broader narrative that intertwines pop culture with the unpredictable world of politics.So, while the clip shown at Comic-Con is indeed real, it is not a recent production meant for this year’s event. Instead, it’s a nostalgic piece that has found renewed relevance amid Harris' current political journey.","Reports swirled on Sunday that Vice President Kamala Harris made a surprise video appearance at Comic-Con during a "" Simpsons "" panel.

Investors multiply their presale purchase with a twenty five percent bonus if they pick the right guy.Since the beginning, meme coins have dived deep into popular culture.Keeping up with the latest trends, they spur conversations and share the spotlight. Over the years, meme coins have proven to be one of the biggest online forces.For example, the Dogecoin community sponsored the Jamaican bobsled team to attend the Winter Olympics in Sochi in 2014.Dogecoin was still in its early days. But that didn’t stop the community from coming together for a bigger cause. It gave a glimpse of the massive strength of meme coin communities.The Meme Games is the latest example of the trend.The grand welcome of the Meme Games presale reveals its viral potential.

With each new stage of the presale, the price undergoes a small hike.To grab the token for the best prices, investors should act early. Early presale participation is rewarded with higher staking APYs. For a better perspective, the opening staking APY was above 4000%. It is slipping under 3000% as the presale traffic grows.The Meme Games white paper takes a more detailed look at the staking mechanism and how it works.Here is an overview of how the Meme Games works.To enter the Meme Games, investors should hold $MGMES tokens. They are the tickets to glory.Judging by the presale momentum and the exploding community, $MGMES is on the path to a billion-dollar market cap. If investors wait until then to buy the token, it will be weighed down by a hefty price tag.That explains the presale rush. The short presale window gives heavy discounts to early backers.Investors can enter the presale using an Ethereum-compatible wallet like Metamask, Best Wallet, or Coinbase Wallet. In addition to ETH, USDT, and BNB, the presale supports purchases using fiat currencies.Once the presale purchase is done, investors can pick their favourite meme character to compete in a “169-metre dash.”This is the golden opportunity to multiply the presale investment with a twenty five percent bonus. Doge, Pepe, Brett, Turbo, and Dogwifhat represent different countries.They have their unique traits and strengths, but an equal chance of winning. That is one out of five, or twenty percent.Being powered by blockchain, the winner selection is fair and purely random. External factors can’t influence the results. The $MGMES smart contract has completed an extensive audit by SolidProof.The presale has no minimum purchase limits.No matter how low the budget is, investors can join the riveting Meme Games through the presale. Each presale purchase gives them a chance to pick a meme athlete and win a twenty five percent token multiplier.Taking advantage of the unlimited entries, investors can join the presale as often as possible. It maximises the chances of winning.Staking offers a thrilling opportunity to put the tokens to work right from the beginning. It is active from the presale stage. Whether investors get lucky and unlock the token multiplier or not, staking will continue to accumulate rewards.Staked tokens have a brief seven-day lock-up window. The mechanism prevents early sell-offs to strengthen the price trajectory. Toward the end of the lock-up window, the tokens can potentially go multifold up the charts.With the meme coin market rebounding, $MGMES tokens are predicted to explode on their release. Potential interest rate cuts in September will encourage more investors to dive into the market for quick gains.The $MGMES staking APYs are dynamically structured to favour early investors. They are eligible for lower presale prices as well.","The Meme Games ($MGMES), touted as the Olympics meme coin, has ignited the latest crypto frenzy.

International Business Machines Corp reported a jump in bookings for its artificial intelligence business as customers work to implement the latest technology.

Ford Motor Co posted second-quarter profit that fell short of Wall Street estimates, saying quality problems with new vehicles led to a surge in warranty costs.

Bank of America Corp said its board authorized another $25 billion stock repurchase program.

Whirlpool Corp, the owner of Maytag, lowered its full-year earnings forecast, as consumers continued to shy away from big-ticket appliance purchases amid a weakening housing market.

Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc’s limited-time offers and speedy service helped it beat expectations in the second quarter, but executives warned the burrito chain will face pressures to profitability.

ServiceNow Inc. reported better-than-expected sales and bookings in the second quarter, signaling strong customer demand for its broad suite of software tools.

Wall Street got a reality check after a disappointing start of the megacap earnings season fueled concern the artificial-intelligence frenzy that has powered the bull market might be overblown.A selloff in big tech sent the S&P 500 to its worst day since December 2022, ending the best stretch without a 2% drop since the start of the global financial crisis.Losses were more pronounced in the Nasdaq 100, which tumbled over 3.5%. Alphabet Inc. slid 5% after sinking more resources into its drive to outmatch rivals in AI, with spending higher than analysts expected. Tesla Inc.’s profit miss and the Robotaxi delay spurred a 12% stock plunge.“Investors are finally waking up to all that AI spend and realizing it is much more of an expense right now rather than a revenue generator,” said Peter Boockvar at The Boock Report.Wednesday’s session was another lesson in the “concentration risk” bears see as latent in a market whose upside has owed disproportionately to a narrow cohort of massive gainers. For a fourth straight session — and the 10th time in 11 days — the performance of smaller companies exceeded larger ones, evidence investor tastes have shifted from the megacap tech names that have come to dominate benchmark indexes.The Treasury curve steepened on bets the Federal Reserve is close to cutting rates. Former New York Fed President William Dudley called for lower borrowing costs — preferably at next week’s gathering. For many analysts, such a move would be worrisome as it would indicate officials rushing to avoid a recession.The loonie fell as the Bank of Canada cut rates, focused on “downside risks.” The yen hit the highest since May amid an unwind in carry trades.To Steve Clayton at Hargreaves Lansdown, this could be the year markets start talking about the “So-So Seven,” noting that results from Tesla and Alphabet are not enough to maintain their momentum.“The market is not impressed with the start of earnings season for the mega tech stocks,” said Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB. “There was a lot resting on these results and we don’t think that they give clear answers to questions about the effectiveness and profit potential for AI right now.”After driving the rally in stocks for most of 2024, big tech slammed into a wall. Traders rotated from megacaps to lagging parts of the market, spurred by bets on Fed rate cuts and concern AI still needs to pay off.“Tech’s problem isn’t just that earnings are less than perfect, but the group is still caught up in the violent rotation trade that kicked off with the June CPI,” said Vital Knowledge’s Adam Crisafulli. “Many assumed the anti-tech rotation would be ephemeral and the fact it’s proving durable is compounding anxiety toward the group and spurring additional selling pressure.”The drubbing in these stocks has seen some of the air come out of valuations. While that’s something that could argue in favor of dip buying, the earnings season is just getting started. Apple Inc, Microsoft Corp, Amazon.com Inc and Meta Platforms Inc are all due toTo Jose Torres at Interactive Brokers, the equity correction is far from over. “Yesterday we wrote that a 10% to 15% correction was in the cards this quarter, historically the worst period of the year,” Torres said. “This quarter, the valuation concerns are paired with front-loaded gains, irrational exuberance, a high bar for earnings estimates and a presidential election.”In fact, the second-quarter US earnings season is off to a weaker start than usual.Among S&P 500 companies that reported results, profits beat analyst estimates by the smallest margin since the end of 2022 — while sales surprises were the worst in at least two years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.“We are still looking for volatility to increase moving through the second half of 2024 - with the potential for a 10% to 15% correction in benchmarks like the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100,” said Dan Wantrobski at Janney Montgomery Scott. “Our work does not point to secular/structural downturn at this time, but rather a pause in the reflationary expansion cycle that began a few years ago.”Just as earnings roll in, a key technical indicator in the US stock market sat close to historic extremes — a crucial gauge that has foretold past selloffs.Known as the “the 200-DMA” — an abbreviation of 200-day moving average — the gauge measures how the S&P 500 is performing against that longer-term measure. At one point last week, the benchmark was trading as much as 15% above it, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.While the gap has since narrowed — to 9% through Wednesday’s close — that kind of gulf above 12% still preceded declines for the index in 2011, 2018 and 2021. Although that does not necessarily mean the market is about to tank, it is a warning sign for investors concerned about lofty tech valuations and concentration risk.","A selloff in big tech sent the S&P 500 to its worst day since December 2022.

Using SIMBARA, the government would be able to track the nickel and tin from mines to domestic smelters .""Smelting companies have to register where they buy the nickel from and where the mines are,"" Septian Hario Seto, deputy coordinating minister for maritime and investment affairs, said in an interview.Smelters will not be allowed to unload ore shipments from mines that have not yet paid their royalties. The system successfully increased government revenue in the coal sector, Seto told Reuters, and hoped to see similar improvement in the nickel and tin sectors.The SIMBARA system will also be linked to the government's digital records of mining quotas , known as RKAB. It enables miners to track how much production quota a miner has left for the period and to alert authorities should there be discrepancies in output and sales data, he added.A senior official has said Jakarta will implement the system on other minerals such as bauxite and copper, but the timing would be decided later on, once the nickel and tin tracking system has run smoothly.","Indonesia is the world's biggest producer of nickel and one of its largest producers of tin.
