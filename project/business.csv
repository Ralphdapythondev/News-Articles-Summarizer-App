Aadhaar card update online: The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) has been urging citizens to review and update their Aadhaar card information, especially for those who obtained their cards more than a decade ago and haven't made any changes since then. However, it is important to note that these updates are not mandatory.Keeping your address up-to-date is crucial to ensure that you receive important documents such as your PAN card, passport, bank statements, and other essential paperwork.While updating your address is not compulsory, it is highly recommended.Several documents can be used as proof of identity and address, including Ration cards, Voter identity cards, Government-issued identity cards or certificates with an address, and Indian Passport.Other documents, such as PAN cards, Driving licenses, Secondary or Senior School mark sheets or School leaving certificates with a photograph, and Government-issued identity cards or certificates, serve only as proof of identity.Documents like Electricity, water, or gas bills from the last 3 months, Bank or Post Office passbooks, and rent, lease, or leave & license agreements can be used as proof of address only, according to an ET report.To update your address in Aadhaar for free, you can submit the necessary documents either online through the myaadhar portal or by visiting any Aadhaar centre in person. If you choose to submit the documents online, follow these step-by-step instructions:Step 1: Visit https://myaadhaar.uidai.gov.in/Step 2: Login and verify details 'Name/Gender/Date of Birth & Address Update'Step3: Click on update address (tick the consent box to proceed) Click on 'Update Aadhaar Online 'Step 4: Upload a scanned copy proof of address and give consent in the required format.Step 5: Make payment of Rs 50 (Not required till September 14, 2024).Step 6: A Service Request Number (SRN) will be generated.

If you need to make any additional updates, such as changing your name or date of birth, you will need to visit an enrollment center in person.Updating your mobile number does not require any documents, but the Aadhaar card holder must be present for biometric authentication. The fee for updating a mobile number is Rs 50 per request, which can include one or more demographic updates.""Residents who had got their Aadhaar issued 10 years ago, and have never updated after that in these years, such Aadhaar number holders are encouraged to get their documents updated. The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) has previously issued a press release underlining that it is urging and encouraging residents to keep their documents updated. The recently issued gazette notification also clearly mentions that residents ""may"" do so on completion of every 10 years. Keeping the documents in Aadhaar updated helps in ease of living, better service delivery, and enables accurate authentication. UIDAI has always encouraged residents to keep their documents updated, and the gazette notification is another step in that direction,"" states a PIB release from November 10, 2022.","The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) has been urging citizens to review and update their Aadhaar card information, especially for those who obtained their cards more than a decade ago and haven't made any changes since then.

On ICICI ESOPs

On pension amounts drawn

NEW DELHI: Securities and Exchange Board of India ( Sebi ) chief Madhabi Puri Buch and her husband Dhaval Buch on Friday issued a joint statement amid allegations by US short-seller Hindenburg Research saying that she adhered to all disclosure and recusal guidelines set by the markets regulator.""Madhabi has never dealt with any file involving Agora Advisory , Agora Partners, the Mahindra Group , timesofindia Pidilite , Dr Reddy’s , Alvarez and Marsal, Sembcorp, Visu Leasing or ICICI Bank at any stage after her joining Sebi,"" the statement read.Terming the allegations ""false, incorrect, malicious and motivated"", the statement said that the allegations are ""based on our Income Tax Returns"" which ""clearly have been obtained by adopting fraudulent means and illegally"".The Buchs said it was ""a clear breach of not only our right to privacy (which is a fundamental right) but also a violation of the Income Tax Act. The facts, transparently reflected in our income tax returns, have been twisted deliberately to create a false narrative.""In the statement, it has been claimed that after Dhaval's retirement, ""he undertook his consulting practice under the two companies Agora Advisory and Agora"" and that his assignments were undertaken ""under company structure"" to ensure transparency by isolating income generated and report accruals and assignment-related expenses.""It is unfortunate that a process that actually facilitates greater transparency is being sought to be projected as suspicious"", the duo said in a statement.The duo also issued a clarification on the rental income they received from a property that was leased out -- where the lessee happened to be an associate of Wokhardt, a listed company which had come under probe.In the joint statement, it has been claimed that ""Madhabi has not dealt with any files related to Wockhardt"".""Given the all-India remit of SEBI's responsibilities, which encompass hundreds of investigations, thousands of surveillance alerts, hundreds of approvals, and hundreds of orders annually, the Chairperson is usually not even aware of specific cases, as they are handled in the normal course by other designated officials as per Delegation of Powers which have always been in place,"" the statement read.They said that the ""rental agreement for the property in question was concluded inaccordance with standard market practices and this property jointly owned by Madhabiand Dhaval is leased and the rental from the same is declared and tax paid accordingly"".The couple has said that ""even an allegation of conflict is not only defamatory, false and vexatious, but is clearly malicious and motivated"".On charges linked to ICICI ESOPs that it can only be exercise in three months, the statement said ""the provisions of ICICI Bank's ESOP scheme were different for resigning and retiring employees"".The statement said that Madhabi, like other senior employees, received ESOPs during her tenure and that only employees ""who resigned were required to exercise their vested options within three months"".Replying to the allegations concerning uneven nature of pension amounts with gaps in between, the duo said ""pension payments were consistent"" and that they were part of ""a contributory Annuity Scheme from ICICI Prudential"".""The uneven amounts related to exercise of ESOPS at various stages over the ten years. Depending on when Madhabi exercised her options and the prevailing market prices at the relevant time and the quantity of ESOPs exercised, the perquisite value is bound to vary each year,"" the statement read.""If no ESOPs were exercised in a given year, there would be zero value attached to it and this would be bound to be reflected in the returns as a gap year. This perquisite value is required to be filed under the ""Salary"" category both by ICICI Bank and by the ex-employee. This is a clear law of the land,"" they added.","Madhabi Puri Buch and her husband Dhaval Buch issued a joint statement amid allegations by US short-seller Hindenburg Research.

Fixed deposit rates above 8%: Several small finance banks (SFBs) have increased their fixed deposit rates to over 8% for a two-year tenure as they compete with larger banks like State Bank of India and HDFC Bank to attract funds from regular savers in a market where alternative investment options have grown in recent years.SFBs are providing 100-125 basis points more on deposits compared to a year ago, which is also about 120 basis points higher than what major banks such as SBI and HDFC Bank are offering.According to an ET report, Utkarsh SFB and Suryoday SFB are offering 8.5% on two-three year tenures, while Equitas SFB is offering 8.5% on a tenure of two years to less than three years. Unity SFB is offering 9% on 1,001 days.In comparison, SBI's highest rate is 7.25% for 444 days, and HDFC Bank's highest rate is 7.4%, with an additional 50 bps for senior citizens.Some finance companies are also competing with banks by offering above 8% interest on fixed deposits .

Check list Kanika Pasricha, chief economic advisor at Union Bank of India, was quoted as saying, ""Deposits are still lagging on an incremental basis, and this is a cause for concern. Therefore, since July, the fight has intensified among banks to raise deposit rates. With deposits lagging, borrowings like infrastructure bonds have suddenly picked up.""India's financial market is imbalanced due to the opposing trends in the demand for and availability of funds, which an economist attributed to the RBI's strict monetary policy aimed at reducing inflation to the legally required 4%.Moreover, the attractive returns offered by growth assets have contributed to the democratization of India's equity culture, diverting funds from traditional bank deposits to pooled assets like various mutual funds and exchange-traded funds.",SFBs are providing 100-125 basis points more on deposits compared to a year ago.

Source: ET quoting Paisabazaar for interest rates data as on August 14, 2024.

Highest Fixed Deposit Interest Rates: Fixed deposits (FDs) offered by banks are secure and interest-generating investment options. With FDs, you can expect a guaranteed return on your invested funds, which remain unaffected by market fluctuations. This is the reason that FDs are a go to investment option for most risk averse investors.Interest rates for fixed deposits are near all time highs, with RBI pausing the rate cycle for several monetary policy meetings now.Investors have the flexibility to choose between the re-investment deposit option, which allows for the accumulation of compound interest, or the option to receive interest payments at regular intervals (monthly/quarterly) to support their financial planning and budgeting needs, notes an ET report.The interest rates offered on fixed deposits in August 2024 can vary based on several factors, including the specific bank, the age of the depositor, the tenure of the deposit, and the amount invested.In India, private banks are financial institutions where private companies or individuals hold the majority of the equity, in contrast to public-sector banks where the government is the primary shareholder.Public Sector Undertaking (PSU) banks are ones where the government owns the majority of the shares. These banks receive government subsidies with the aim of facilitating their growth and expansion.For investors interested in comparing fixed deposit interest rates between private and public sector banks, a brief analysis of the fixed deposit rates offered to both general citizens and senior citizens is provided below.","Public Banks: Latest Fixed Deposit Interest Rates For General Citizens.

It is considered the official festival of the state and involves various cultural activities. The date of Onam is determined by the Panchangam and falls on the 22nd nakshatra Thiruvonam in the month of Chingam according to the Malayalam calendar, which corresponds to the period between August and September in the Gregorian calendar.In September 2024, banks will be closed for 15 days, depending on the state, due to various occasions such as Tirubhav Tithi of Srimanta Sankardeva, Ganesh Chaturthi, First Onam, Milad-un-Nabi or Id-e Milad, Indrajatra/Id-e-Milad, Pang-Lhabsol, Friday following Eid-i-Milad-ul-Nabi, Sree Narayana Guru Samadhi Day, and Birthday of Maharaja Hari Singh Ji.On these specified holidays, bank operations cannot be conducted, and physical banking services are unavailable.

The ongoing geopolitical tensions, particularly in the Taiwan Strait, have led Taiwanese semiconductor companies to diversify their operations abroad.TSMC and other key players like UMC are investing in fabs in the U.S., Japan, and Germany, focusing on both advanced and legacy chip production. For instance, TSMC is building fabs in Arizona and Germany, where it collaborates with local suppliers to produce advanced chips. However, no such announcement or collaboration with Indian companies has been made so far.The report states that Japan is providing training to Indian workers, while Taiwan is investing in semiconductor clusters in Southeast Asia. Strengthening such collaborations could provide the much-needed expertise and investment to bolster India's semiconductor ecosystem.Nonetheless, the report noted that the collaboration between Tata Group and Powerchip Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (PSMC) is a positive step towards developing the semiconductor ecosystem in India. Recently, Tata announced a partnership with Taiwan's PSMC to build a 28-nanometer fab plant.The report emphasises the need for India to improve its infrastructure and manufacturing ecosystem to attract significant investments in the sector. India also needs to select the right companies to improve manufacturing yields.It underscores concerns about the talent pool, stating that while many Indian students receive semiconductor training in Taiwan, a majority prefer to stay abroad, limiting the country's ability to build a skilled domestic workforce.India's infrastructure, intellectual property protection, and regulatory environment also need improvement to attract global semiconductor manufacturers and build a flourishing semiconductor ecosystem.On the global front, India has an opportunity to capitalise on shifting trade dynamics. With the U.S. and EU increasingly wary of Chinese components in their supply chains, India could position itself as a non-China alternative.Domestically, India's demand for semiconductor chips is expected to surpass USD 100 billion by 2030, driven by the growing demand for electronic goods, the report says.","Taiwan holds a dominant position in semiconductor manufacturing, with its companies accounting for 78 percent of the world's fab manufacturing.

Railway Budget 2024 : The government has wavered little in its efforts to spur a modernisation of railways in the country, pivoting on technology, to support the country’s economic ambitions. In line with expectations, Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore, marking yet another year of successive increase in outlay.That takes forward the past policies and the government’s vision, which have paved the way for modernisation of the transport behemoth.In earlier decades, the government had focused on laying tracks on new routes, electrification and incremental rolling stock capacity addition. That was the need of the hour back then and has helped set up the base for a larger transformation.For instance, the massive Dedicated Freight Corridor ( DFC ) as well as locomotive factories at Marhaura and Madhepura in Bihar were conceptualised over a decade ago and we are seeing their completion now.More recently, the focus has shifted to modernisation—of rolling stock and safety systems, among other aspects.This year, emphasis has also been laid on the railways’ crucial role in industrial development. Commodity-specific corridors have been planned in eastern India and impetus given to port connectivity. Vande Bharat and technology-led upgrades in rolling stock remain in focus. Safety has been prioritised through budgetary allocations for the anti-collision systemKavach . That said, there are other cogs in the wheel that demand attention from a long-term perspective.First, the target for the Operating Ratio, the crucial efficiency gauge, has been set at 98.22% for 2024-25, compared with 98.65% in 2023-24. This reflects an imminent need for operational transformation. An effective overhaul of the world’s fourth-largest rail network will take many years and thus we need to start focusing on improving efficiency and reducing costs now.DFC is almost entirely operational and will be complete over the next few months. To ensure the project achieves its twin goals of reducing logistics costs and enhancing freight efficiency, railways need to attract more cargo on the corridor. This will help increase the rail coefficient and make the railways’ approach more market-oriented, which will in turn aid future corridors.A revamp of railway stations is on track, with sufficient funds dedicated to this end. But even though new coaches and wagons are increasingly being added to meet footfalls, the stations and passenger trains themselves remain synonymous with chaos.Just as safety, comfort and convenience have been prioritised, there is a need for solutions to address the capacity and demand challenges. As a first step, the government could target development of new stations and setting up of new coach production units.As a leading freight mover, Indian Railways carried a record 1,588 MT cargo in fiscal 2024, up from 1,095 MT in fiscal 2015. It accounts for 26% of the cargo moved in the country—by no means an easy feat. The railways aims to take this volume to 3,000 MT by 2030, which would require a 11% CAGR against the around 4.2% witnessed over the last 10 years. As per a report by TERI and Shakti Foundation, from carrying about 62% of freight traffic in 1990-91, Indian Railways’ share has declined to ~27% in 2014-15. This has been due to the expanding road network, cost competitiveness over railways, and door-to-door service. Thus, commencing the cycle of increasing the rail share again is commendable.DFCs, a high-capacity track network, high-power locomotives and improvement in wagon designs have set the ball rolling for larger capacity, faster freight trains that deliver better efficiency.Yet, achieving exponential growth is a tall ask given the current dynamics. Possibly, similar challenges might apply to other goals the railways might have for 2047.To be fair, despite its scale and complexity, Indian Railways has been able to achieve diverse developments at commendable speed.But the track ahead is long and it is time to start discussing the reinvention of the institutional set-up.Indian Railways sees substantial private sector involvement in the form of vendors and contractors. Policymakers could start mulling extreme options such as parallel privately-owned and operated railway infrastructure, coupled with centralised planning and an evolved role for the railways. This will need a robust policy framework from the Government of India.The time is perhaps also ripe to bring user charge and asset monetisation-driven segments for passengers as well as cargo to the discussion table. Globally, the separation of infrastructure and operations in railways has delivered mixed results, for example in the United Kingdom. The model should be analysed and revisited to understand its potential relevance in the Indian context.The key would be to retrace our steps and align our long-term goals to identify not just incremental changes but also ways to explore bold and path-breaking alternatives that put Indian Railways on a smooth track and bring it up to speed.","Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore.

Budget 2024 capital gains tax changes: The Narendra Modi government is considering suggestions for tweaks in the new long term capital gains tax regime that was announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman in Union Budget 2024.The July 23 budget reduced the LTCG tax on property from 20% to 12.5%. The indexation benefit, which allowed taxpayers to adjust the acquisition cost for inflation before calculating capital gains and thus reduce their tax liability, is proposed to be eliminated for properties purchased on or after April 1, 2001.The government publishes the Cost Inflation Index (CII) annually for this calculation.India Inc is appealing to the government for a gradual shift to the long-term capital gains tax regime proposed in the FY25 budget, which aims to eliminate indexation benefits for property, gold, and other unlisted assets.According to an ET report by Deepshikha Sikarwar, the industry is suggesting alternatives such as a higher tax rate with indexation or a lower rate of 12.5% without indexation, as well as some form of grandfathering for ancestral properties.The finance ministry is currently reviewing these proposals and will discuss them with the Prime Minister's Office. The final decision will be made closer to the date when the Finance Bill reply is to be presented in Parliament, the reports said.Industry groups are expected to submit formal proposals to the finance ministry in the near future.

Budget 2024 for manufacturing sector : The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth. While the middle class has been offered tax relief, the government's primary focus remains on judicious spending to maximize economic impact. The budget's core themes are employment, skilling, MSME development, and support for the middle class.Largely focus has remained intact on spending money judiciously to ensure that each penny spent creates a ripple effect in the entire economic landscape.Although at first glance, manufacturing might appear to have taken a backseat, a deeper analysis reveals a multifaceted approach to bolstering the sector. Initiatives like employment-linked benefits and internship programs, while primarily aimed at job creation and skill development, indirectly benefit manufacturing companies by expanding the talent pool.Extensive focus on the MSME manufacturing units by way of extending term loan facility for purchase of machinery and equipment without collateral or third-party guarantee, would help companies in augmenting their capital base/ capacity and strengthen the very foundation of the manufacturing ecosystem in the country. Development of a new credit-assessment model by Public Sector Banks to assess MSME credit shall provide much needed regulatory relief to the units.With respect to the large manufacturing entities, while there is no direct fiscal/ tax incentive introduced in this budget, some support has been provided with an extensive focus on development of ‘industrial parks’ in nearly 100 cities under the ‘plug and play’ model. Reforms proposed with respect to land administration, planning and management, shall also ease out acquisition related difficulties often faced by entrepreneurs/ business houses in acquiring lands for manufacturing set-ups.Targeted Customs duty interventions like, rationalization of Customs duty provisions in Mobile phone manufacturing setups, extension of Customs duty exemption on import of capital goods for manufacturing of solar cells and panels, full Customs duty exemption on import of 25 critical minerals,, shall provide the required impetus for enhancing domestic manufacturing environment.Governments’ focus on formulating an Economic Policy Framework to set the scope for next-gen reforms in the country, has a target to improve the productivity of factors of production, namely, land, labour, capital, entrepreneurship and technology. This shall pave the way for enabling achievement of a target of 25% manufacturing sector contribution to the nation’s GDP over the course of next 7-10 years.While the overall outlook is positive, the extension of tax benefits under Section 115BAB for manufacturing entities and the absence of new PLI schemes are notable omissions.The country’s manufacturing base is expanding as is reflective from the continuously increasing tax collections and expanding Purchasing Manager’s Index. It would be pertinent to see how the ground realities evolve vis-à-vis the vision envisaged, in the upcoming Financial Year.","The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth.

Budget 2024: Armed with the vision to propel India to become a developed country by 2047, the Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business thereby providing the required stimulus to the manufacturing sector and enabling large scale job creation.On the Indirect tax front, the industry welcomes the much-needed announcement for a comprehensive review of the rate structure under Customs enabling ease in product classification and dispute reduction.The proposal of lowering of Customs duty on a plethora of raw materials and products including solar cells, critical minerals and bullion are encouraging measures. The rationale behind such reduction clearly indicates support towards domestic manufacturing, deepening value addition and supporting targets in reducing carbon footprint.Relevant amendments under the Customs law have been made to provide increased time limits for re-imports and re-exports to enhance competitiveness of the fledgling MRO sector. The government has extended significant duty reduction and exemption benefits to the healthcare and electronics sectors, continuing the impetus of incentives provided under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme.Since their introduction in March 2020, the PLI schemes have indeed supported in revitalizing the manufacturing sector and strengthening the necessary supply chains. The success achieved in the mobile manufacturing sector has now enabled the Government to reduce customs duties on mobile phones and components, signalling a mature environment. The Budget proposals aim at reproducing similar outcomes for semiconductor and pharmaceutical industry by increasing the budgetary allocation.Buoyed by the increasing revenue collection under GST signalling a shift towards a mature tax regime, this Budget has harmonized the timeframes for the issuance of demand notices and adjudication orders for cases involving fraud, suppression or otherwise. Significant amendments to the GST legislations have been introduced reflecting the recommendations proposed by the GST Council such as regularizing non-levy of GST due to general practice which may turn out to be a breather for certain impacted industries reeling under huge tax demands.The Insurance sector has been provided much relief through the GST council recommendations which have been cemented in the present budget thereby ending long standing disputes on their business practices.The Government's efforts to push forward with its reform agenda are evident as plans to incentivize states for their business reform actions plans and digitalization through the Jan Vishwas Bill 2.0 is proposed. Further, setting up of e-commerce export hubs is envisaged to facilitate easier access to international markets for domestic players.The recent implementation of Budget proposals allows the government to maintain momentum in its reform agenda. These policy measures implicitly reaffirm the significance of India Inc as a crucial element in the development of infrastructure. However, there are still some expectations required to be met to march towards a Viksit Bharat 2047.",The Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business.

Budget 2024 : Real estate, a significant contributor to employment generation, has received a fair bit of attention in Budget 2024-25. Recent years have seen the sector transform rapidly, driven by factors such as favourable government policies, Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, strong economic growth and changing consumer preferences.Added to that, the budgetary focus on job creation, skilling and employment-linked incentives, infrastructure, urban development, rural connectivity, digitalisation and land-related norms, all dovetail to promote growth of the sector.Launched in June 2015, the PMAY aims to provide affordable housing to all eligible beneficiaries. The budget unveiled PMAY Urban 2.0, under which the housing needs of 1 crore urban poor and middle class will be addressed with an investment of Rs 10 lakh crore.The central government’s additional Rs 2.2 lakh crore injection in the next 5 years to make housing more affordable has the potential to revitalise the affordable housing market.Such an approach can play an important role in realising the government's vision of Housing for All and push growth and development. Hence, the significant investment under PMAY Urban 2.0 is expected to alleviate urban housing deficits, spurring construction and economic growth.Steps to introduce technological reforms within the regulatory framework for land, such as digitalisation or GIS mapping of land records, will improve transparency.Rationalisation of stamp duty across states will also be critical to bring in uniformity and initiate land-related reforms such as urban planning, usage and building bylaws.These are steps in the right direction and will boost growth. Moreover, they will improve the ease of property transactions and strengthen municipal finances through increased property taxes. Rationalization of stamp duty with an emphasis on women homebuyers may boost home-buyer sentiment in major cities, too.The budget has also given ample attention to urban and rural development, with rental housing for industrial workers through the public private partnership model, interest subsidies for rental housing, and transit-oriented developments.The proposal to develop investment-ready plug-and-play industrial parks in 100 cities may attract industrial investment, leading to increased demand for industrial real estate and support the growth of ancillary services and residential developments in these regions.Initiatives for industrial parks and rental housing for industrial workers align with the country’s manufacturing goals and addresses worker accommodation needs.These steps are expected to promote industrial growth and stability in labour-intensive sectors, while also creating new opportunities for real estate developers specialising in rental and affordable housing.The changes in long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax, however, have evoked a mixed reaction. The government lowered the long-term capital gains tax from 20% to 12.5%, which is a welcome step. However, this came with the removal of the indexation benefit.The changes could encourage more liquidity in property transactions and potentially increase the effective tax burden depending on the property’s acquisition date.The launch of Phase IV of the PM Gram Sadak Yojana in 25,000 rural habitations will improve connectivity in rural areas, promoting rural development and making these regions more accessible for investment. The primary objective of PMGSY is to build robust, all-weather roads in rural habitations. This initiative focuses on enhancing connectivity and supporting economic development in rural areas.In essence, the budget is geared towards stimulating growth and investment in the real estate sector , fostering a more transparent and investor-friendly environment, and contributing to overall development.

New Budget 2024 rule: Why Income Tax Department is likely to issue a huge number of tax notices this month,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-budget-2024-rule-why-income-tax-department-is-likely-to-issue-a-huge-number-of-tax-notices-this-month/articleshow/112186079.cms,"Taxing Times

Income Tax Notice on the way? The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month, as there are concerns that many taxpayers might escape the tax net due to the impending implementation of the new reassessment law on September 1, 2024.According to the amended regulation announced in Budget 2024 , the tax authorities can only go back a maximum of five years to reassess a taxpayer's records if the escaped income is at least Rs 50 lakh, and three years for an amount less than Rs 50 lakh.Previously, they could reassess cases up to 10 years old.According to an ET report, tax officials are now faced with the challenge of compiling and corroborating data on tax and income mismatches for the financial years 2013-14 to 2017-18 within the next few weeks, as these years will become time-barred for reassessment from September 1, 2024.The I-T department relies on information from various sources, such as banks, property registrars, and search findings from the investigation wing, to build reassessment cases.A tax officers' body has raised concerns about the feasibility of issuing notices under Section 148 (or 148A) in a large number of cases within a single month, given the overburdened nature of the jurisdictional assessing officers and the time-consuming process of obtaining sanction from the chief commissioner, who is the specified authority for such notices.Moreover, the law provides taxpayers with the right to explain their position before reassessment orders are finalized, a process that most believe cannot be completed by the end of August.Also Read | ITR refund status for FY 2023-24: How to check income tax refund status online - here’s a step-by-step guide for incometax.gov.in & NSDL websites The Central Board of Direct Taxes ( CBDT ) has been urged by its officers to postpone the effective date of the proposed amendment. However, this suggestion is unlikely to be well-received by corporations and high net worth individuals.""Capping the reassessment period at five years was a great decision as it would reduce hassles and litigation. But if the department fears there could be a genuine loss of revenue as it may not be possible to wrap up several matters by August 31, the government can think of strict parameters where time-bound cases can be selectively reopened - based on trails of steps taken in identifying escaped income,"" said Mitil Chokshi, partner at CA firm Chokshi & Chokshi.""Taxpayers may expect a rush of reassessment notices in August 2024. These notices are likely to be for the AYs 2018-19 and prior to that. It is pertinent to note that the Bombay High Court in a recent ruling in a case of Hexaware Technologies has taken a view on a proviso introduced in 2021, which can be interpreted to mean that AY 2017-18 (and prior years) got time barred on March 31, 2024. These reassessment notices (for AYs 2017-18 and prior) are likely to rake up new interpretation issues in the already muddled reassessment provisions,"" said Ashish Mehta, partner at law firm Khaitan & Co.The current situation is similar to the conflict between the Income Tax office and taxpayers in 2021. The reassessment law was amended in April 2021, allowing the tax office to reopen 10-year-old tax returns if the total undisclosed income exceeded Rs 50 lakh and reassess 4-year-old matters if the amount was less than Rs 50 lakh.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? However, this change led to over 10,000 writ petitions being filed by companies, arguing that they were not given sufficient time to explain and that the notices were issued without considering the carve-out that cases which couldn't be reopened earlier couldn't be reassessed under the new law.The Supreme Court invoked its extraordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution on May 4, 2022, to uphold all reassessment notices issued after March 31, 2021. However, the court left room for judicial proceedings based on the merits of each case, and several such matters are currently pending before the court.","The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month.

Are NPS Vatsalya & hiked NPS deduction limit for private sector employees good moves from Budget 2024?

NPS and EPF: Overlapping services

What is NPS Vatsalaya?

Latest NPS rules, news: In the Union Budget 2024 speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced two new initiatives with regard to National Pension Scheme (NPS) - extension of NPS 14% employer contribution benefits to private setcor and the intended launch of NPS Vatsalya.Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries, bringing it at par with the provisions available for government employees.Sriram Iyer, CEO, HDFC Pension Management told ET that with this move the “ground rules have been harmonised among government and non-government employees, which is a positive step.”Effectively, this means that now, private-sector employees can choose to reduce the taxable portion of employers’ contribution to their NPS corpus, thereby paying less tax and leaving greater funds in their pension deposits.“Employees will benefit from tax savings . More importantly, the 40% increase in contribution will have a significant impact on the terminal value of the retirement corpus,” remarked Iyer. The extended savings will “help in retirement planning, working as an option that is at par with the Provident Fund,” Dinesh Rohira, CEO & Founder, 5nance.com was quoted as saying.Moreover, the endeavour aims to increase NPS penetration by increasing tax incentives for the private sector, providing them a social security-cushion post-retirement.The scheme’s motive to widen the NPS subscriber base may not prove to be flawlessly effective, however. This is explained by Agrees Mrin Agarwal, Founder, Finsafe India: “While it’s good that the limit has been raised, it may not increase adoption as employees need to be educated in a big way. Also, the benefit is only for the salaried opting for the new tax regime,” she says.The mandatory contribution to the EPF, too, threatens to relegate the provisions of NPS under the umbrella of near-superfluity. This sentiment is echoed by Varun Sahay, a software engineer in a Delhi-based IT company: “When 12% of my salary is already deducted for the EPF, why should I put in more in the NPS and cut my take-home pay?”Rohira feels otherwise. “There’s no competition between the NPS and EPF as employees can contribute to both and build a 3-4 times bigger corpus while earning 3-4% higher returns via marketlinked options in the NPS,” he counters.Also Check | New Tax Regime 2023 vs 2024 After Budget: How Much Income Tax Will Salaried Taxpayers Save & How Do New Tax Slabs Compare To Old Regime? Top 10 Points You Must Know To jumpstart retirement savings for children, a new initiative called NPS Vatsalya has been unveiled in the Budget. This scheme allows parents and guardians to contribute to a minor's account, which can be converted into a regular NPS account once the child reaches adulthood.""It provides a very long duration for reaping the compounding benefits and accumulating a huge bounty at a later age. This can be a good way to plan a better future for kids who may not opt for a service segment in the future,"" says Rohira. Sriram Iyer agrees, stating, ""It’s a good move to help the child start his retirement journey. Even if a parent starts when the child is 10 years old, by the time he starts working, it can be a solid foundation for the compounding journey after that.""However, some experts question the utility of a product with such a long lock-in period, especially when parents cannot use the funds for essential goals like their child’s education amidst soaring education costs of 11-12%.""Parents are struggling to save for their own retirement, so it might be a bit of a stretch to expect them to save for their kids’ retirement. The need of the hour is a market-linked product that allows withdrawals only for the child’s education,"" says Mrin Agarwal, Founder of Finsafe India.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? Though the NPS permits partial withdrawals, it allows only 25% of the corpus after three years of joining, and this can be done only three times during the entire tenure. A premature exit before 60 years with 100% withdrawal is only possible if the corpus is less than Rs.2.5 lakh, an amount insufficient for most children's goals.""In its current form, there won’t be any uptake,"" asserts Agarwal. Rohira concurs, ""It’s a vanilla product with a lock-in, which does not make it very attractive and it may not take off. However, the government may optimise it and introduce new features later."" Iyer adds, ""This is just a start and there may be more subscriber-friendly features as we take it to the market. The regulator is proactive and open to feedback.""","Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries.

Gold import duty cut: Why Indians may not find buying gold from Dubai as attractive post Budget 2024,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-import-duty-cut-why-indians-may-not-find-buying-gold-from-dubai-as-attractive-post-budget-2024/articleshow/112097671.cms,"Gold import duty cut in Budget 2024: The recent reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai. Indian jewellers with stores in both India and the UAE believe that the narrowed duty differential will result in lower gold prices in India, making it less attractive for Indians to purchase gold in Dubai.The emirate had attracted gold-enthusiast Indians following a steep rise in customs duty in India in July 2022. In the fiscal 2024-25 budget, the duty on gold imports was more than halved.The duty cut is also expected to boost gold jewellery production in India, particularly the popular 'Kolkatti' jewellery from Kolkata, which is favored by Indian expats in Dubai and tourists from various countries. This move will encourage gold artisans to create new designs in both heavyweight and lightweight jewellery, attracting consumers to purchase gold from India.According to an ET report, Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group , estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India as Indian tourists who previously bought jewellery in Dubai will now prefer to shop in India. However, Indian expats living in Dubai and other customers may continue to buy from the UAE.Also Read | Gold losing sheen?

He points out that the labour cost is significantly lower in India, and with the introduction of mandatory hallmarking and HUID numbers, the purity of gold in India is no longer a concern.Furthermore, NRIs in Dubai do not receive VAT refunds, and Indians travelling abroad only receive about 60% of the VAT back on their gold purchases. Gold trade analyst Bhargav Baidya suggests that the 1% duty differential between gold jewellery in India and Dubai will be offset by Indian jewellers offering discounts to retain and attract customers.Saurabh Gadgil, chairman of PNG Jewellers, notes that Indian import duty is now on par with the US, allowing Indian jewellers to offer competitive prices compared to other countries worldwide. The reduced customs duty is expected to make gold purchases in India more attractive and convenient for Indian consumers, potentially leading to a significant shift in their gold shopping preferences.",The reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai.

Gold losing sheen? The government has reduced its target for issuing gold bonds in the financial year 2024-25 by 38% compared to the previous interim budget goal, according to a senior official. The revised target stands at Rs 18,500 crore, down from Rs 29,638 crore estimated in the interim budget and Rs 26,852 crore (revised estimate) in 2023-24.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told ET ""The decision followed a reassessment of various factors, including investor demand, other investment products and uncertainties around the global economy, as the situation has changed since the interim budget in February.""After accounting for redemptions, the net issuances of sovereign gold bonds are now estimated at Rs 15,000 crore for this fiscal year, a significant decrease from the Rs 26,138 crore projected in the interim budget and Rs 25,352 crore in the revised estimate for 2023-24.Harish Galipelli, director at ILA Commodities India, attributed this shift to retail investors increasingly opting for equities in anticipation of better returns. He also noted that people are uncertain about the potential for further increases in gold prices in the short-to-medium term following a recent rally. Additionally, Galipelli pointed out that savings in rural areas have been impacted by retail inflation and other factors.The gold bond and gold monetisation schemes were introduced by the government in late 2015 to discourage the physical purchase of precious metals and reduce imports, thereby mitigating the negative impact on the current account deficit.The gross collection through these two schemes is now projected to be Rs 20,030 crore in 2024-25, compared to Rs 31,168 crore in the interim budget and Rs 28,240 crore (revised estimate) in the previous fiscal year. Similarly, the net collection is estimated at Rs 16,433 crore, down from Rs 27,571 crore in the interim budget and Rs 26,653 crore in the previous year.

CBI case details

In November 2021, the Delhi government introduced a new liquor policy for 2021-2022. By July 2022, LG VK Saxena had called for a CBI investigation into alleged irregularities in the formulation and implementation of the policy. The CBI subsequently filed a case against 15 persons, including then-Deputy CM Manish Sisodia, and raided Sisodia's home. By September 2022, the Delhi government had scrapped the excise policy.

On November 14, 2022, the ED arrested Vijay Nair, a former CEO linked to AAP, and Hyderabad businessman Abhishek Boinpally. Further, CBI had filed charges against seven people. On February 26, 2023, the CBI arrested Sisodia after eight hours of questioning.

The ED then issued its first summons to Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal on March 21. Between October 2023 and March 2024, the ED issued nine summonses to Kejriwal. On March 21, 2024, the high court refused to grant protection from arrest, and the ED arrested Kejriwal.

On May 10, 2024, the Supreme Court granted Kejriwal interim bail until June 1 to campaign in the Lok Sabha elections. Kejriwal surrendered at Tihar Jail on June 2. On June 20, the trial court granted him regular bail, but the ED moved the high court to challenge this order on June 21. The high court stayed the bail on June 25, prompting AAP to move the Supreme Court. On the same day, the CBI also arrested Kejriwal.

Haitian Immigrants: Haitian immigrants eating pet cats and ducks of residents in Ohio? Here's what happened,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/haitian-immigrants-eating-pet-cats-and-ducks-of-residents-in-ohio-heres-what-happened/articleshow/113200789.cms,"But what has actually happened?

No reports of any stealing of pets, clarifies police

Social media was up in arms Tuesday claiming that illegal Haitian immigrants in Ohio are eating pets of other residents including cats and ducks. Ohio senator JD Vance reacted to the reports and said he raised the issue of Haitian illegal immigrants earlier. ""Reports now show that people have had their pets abducted and eaten by people who shouldn't be in this country.Where is our border czar?"" Vance posted on X.Elon Musk also contributed to the debate as he wrote in a reply to an X post: ""Apparently, people's pet cats are being eaten.""Social media posts, made by right-wingers, claimed that residents of Springfield Ohio are saying that Haitians are eating the pets of other residents. One such incident did actually take place last month as reported by Fox News. An Ohio woman was arrested after she killed a cat and then began eating it in front of the neighbors. Allexis Telia Ferrell, 27, is charged with injuring animals, prohibitions concerning companion animals and disorderly conduct, the report said.The woman reportedly stomped in the cat's head to kill it before she ate it in front of a residential area in Ohio.But there was no evidence to prove whether she is a Haitian woman.The video of the incident went viral over the weekend and Kamala Harris was held responsible for immigrants eating cats in residential areas -- ahead of the big Kamala Harris - Donald Trump debate on September 10.Another photo of a 'Haitian man walking around with an entire goose' added to the online hatred.Republicans shared the video of Kamala Harris stating how her administration extended temporary protected status to over 100,000 Haitian migrants.""Less than three months ago, Kamala Harris and her Administration blocked 300k unvetted Haitian Migrants from being deported out of our country. Today, those unvetted migrants are sucking up precious resources and destroying Springfield, Ohio. Kamala Harris did this,"" Donald Trump Jr posted.The Springfield Police Division said Monday morning they have received no reports related to pets being stolen and eaten. Springfield Police said they were aware of the social media post but this was ""not something that’s on our radar right now"". The claims appeared to have originated from a commenter at a local city meeting, who said migrants were grabbing ducks from the park to kill and eat, and from local crime-watch Facebook groups. They were then shared on other social media platforms with Republicans amplifying them.""It’s all coming to your city if Kamala Harris is elected in November. It doesn’t have to be this way. Beginning on day one, President Trump will begin the largest mass deportation operation in US history – because he’ll always put America, and Americans, FIRST,"" the Trump campaign sent out an email targeting Harris campaign over the Haitian immigrants issue.","Social media posts, made by right-wingers, claimed that residents of Springfield Ohio are saying that Haitians are eating the pets of other residents.

Overreacting to each of these would, in my view, call into question diplomatic judgment,"" Koizumi said when asked about the deal.Sanae Takaichi, Japan's minister in charge of economic security and another prime ministerial candidate, also defended the deal during the same debate attended by eight other Liberal Democratic Party's (LDP) leadership contenders on Saturday.""It appears they are using (the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States) CFIUS to frame this as an economic security issue,"" she said.""However, Japan and the US are allies, and the steel industry is about strengthening our combined resilience.""The 43-year-old son of former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, the junior Koizumi, is seen as a leading contender in the Sept. 27 race to pick the LDP's new leader, who will become the next prime minister due to the party's control of parliament.Koizumi said on Saturday that he would seek a dialogue with the North Korean leadership to resolve the issue over the abduction of Japanese citizens kidnapped by North Korean agents in the 1970s and 1980s.""We want to explore new opportunities for dialogue between people of the same generation, without being bound by conventional approaches, and without preconditions,"" Koizumi said.","Shinjiro Koizumi, Japan's former environment minister, said at a debate on Saturday that Japan and the US should not confront each other when it comes to the steel industry.

The market is witnessing significant developments across top crypto projects like VISTA , Neiro , and BlockDAG .VISTA’s token price skyrocketed 40x after EtherVista ’s launch, driven by its no-code launchpad and a solution to mitigate rug pulls. Neiro, meanwhile, jumped 60% due to a potential short squeeze.Yet, the biggest spotlight is on BlockDAG . Following a highly anticipated AMA with CEO Antony Turner, BlockDAG’s presale crossed $72.4 million, with miner sales alone contributing $5 million.VISTA, the native token of the decentralized exchange EtherVista, has surged 40x since its launch on August 31st. EtherVista’s unique no-code launchpad aims to curb the problem of rug-pulls that has plagued many memecoin projects. Developers can assign fees directly to smart contracts, ensuring more transparent and secure transactions.Unlike traditional percentage-based swap taxes, VISTA’s fees are pegged to USDC, giving traders a more predictable experience. With a capped supply of just 1 million tokens and a built-in burn mechanism, VISTA is positioned to combat inflation and maintain long-term value.$NEIRO, an Ethereum-based meme coin, recently surged over 60%, hitting a high of $0.085 before settling at $0.0768—still a solid 41% gain. This reversal came after a month of bearish trading, as traders stepped in at the $0.0220 support level, driving trading volume from $15 million to nearly $60 million.Although $NEIRO’s fundamentals have not shifted, analysts suggest that a short squeeze could push the price even higher. With millions in short positions on the token, a climb to the $0.113 resistance level remains possible.Over the past few months, BlockDAG has achieved significant milestones in the crypto space. Its presale has already raised over $72.4 million in just a few months, making it the fastest-growing presale in crypto history. Moreover, the BDAG coin has delivered early holders an ROI of over 1,680% and secured two of the largest soccer sponsorship deals in the history of cryptocurrency. Speculation about BDAG reaching $1 per coin by 2025, and delivering a 30,000x ROI in the coming years, has kept miners and holders excited as the project continues to expand rapidly.The latest excitement comes from BlockDAG’s recent AMA, where CEO Antony Turner shed light on the network’s mining ecosystem. Turner highlighted the advantages of the X Series Miners—X10, X30, and X100. These mining rigs are designed for power and performance, with the X10 delivering 100 MH/s on just 40 watts, while the X100 offers 2 TH/s at 1800 watts.These rigs strike the perfect balance between efficiency and performance, making them highly appealing to miners looking to maximize output while keeping operational costs in check.The impact of this AMA has been significant, leading to the sale of over 11,935 miners and generating almost $5 million in revenue. This has solidified BlockDAG’s position as a top choice for miners and holders.Currently, BDAG is priced at $0.0178 in presale batch 22. With a robust $1 price forecast, those who start minting BDAG coins now could see substantial gains when the forecast is met.While the VISTA token’s 40x price surge and Neiro’s 60% spike have certainly grabbed attention, BlockDAG’s consistent growth and sustainable approach have set it apart.The recent AMA not only highlighted the potential of the X Series Miners but also triggered massive sales and substantiated the claims of crypto experts who are predicting this presale to give 30,000x ROI for early investors.With BlockDAG’s $72.4 million presale milestone already achieved and its miner ecosystem expanding rapidly, all eyes are on the project as it heads toward its next goal: reaching a $1 price per $BDAG coin by early 2025. At the current price of $0.0178, those who start mining BDAG now could secure a significant passive income in the coming months.Presale: https://purchase.blockdag.network Website: https://blockdag.network Telegram: https://t.me/blockDAGnetwork Discord: https://discord.gg/Q7BxghMVyu","VISTA, the native token of the decentralized exchange EtherVista, has surged 40x since its launch on August 31st.

Boeing faces potential strike as workers reject contract in landslide vote,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/boeing-faces-potential-strike-as-workers-reject-contract-in-landslide-vote/articleshow/113324582.cms,"Boeing factory workers in the United States voted on Thursday to go on strike, rejecting a contract offer from the aviation company.The workers, who are represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 751, expressed dissatisfaction with the proposed deal. The vote to reject the contract was 94.6 percent, and the vote to strike was 96 percent, according to union president Jon Holden.The strike will affect two major plane assembly plants in the Puget Sound region and involve about 33,000 workers.Holden said, ""Our members spoke loud and clear tonight. We strike at midnight.""Boeing indicated its willingness to resume negotiations despite the vote outcome. The company said in a statement, ""We remain committed to resetting our relationship with our employees and the union, and we are ready to get back to the table to reach a new agreement.""Under the leadership of new CEO Kelly Ortberg, Boeing had offered a 25-percent wage increase over four years and a commitment to invest in the Puget Sound area. However, workers were dissatisfied, stating that the wage hike was not as generous as portrayed, and the proposed agreement eliminated an annual bonus.The workers had sought a 40 percent wage increase. Critics argued that the proposed 25 percent increase was misleading because it did not account for the loss of the annual bonus. Other issues included the absence of a restored pension and a perceived lack of firm commitments on future projects in the Seattle region.Paul Janousek, an electrician in Everett, highlighted the dissatisfaction, saying, ""They're talking about a 25 percent increase and it's not.""

"Trump's plan to hike tariffs would spike shipping costs, just like in 2018, experts say",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trumps-plan-to-hike-tariffs-would-spike-shipping-costs-just-like-in-2018-experts-say/articleshow/113301252.cms,"US presidential contender Donald Trump 's plan to hike tariffs on imports if he is elected back to the White House in November would send cargo rates soaring and accelerate inflation , just like it did during his 2017-21 term, shipping and retail experts said.Trump, who is running against Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris in the Nov. 5 election, has floated second-term plans for blanket tariffs of 10% to 20% on virtually all imports as well as tariffs of 60% or more on goods from China, in a bid to boost US manufacturing.In their debate on Tuesday, Harris called his proposal a ""Trump sales tax"" that will hurt working families, and has not released her own plan for tariffs. President Joe Biden has delayed implementing a proposedquadruplingof tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles to 100%, and a doubling of duties on semiconductors and solar cells to 50%. He had also proposed new 25% tariffs on lithium-ion batteries, steel and other goods.""Trump's import tariffs are 'history repeating' and will cause a spike in ocean container shipping markets - with consumers picking up the cost,"" said Peter Sand, chief analyst at shipping pricing platform Xeneta.The National Retail Federation, which represents Walmart and other companies that account for almost half of container shipping volume, is among the industry groups opposed to Trump's proposed tariffs.""Tariffs are a tax on imports, operating like a sales tax wearing a mediocre disguise,"" NRF said earlier this week, noting that they drive up cost of goods for consumers and hurt workers and businesses.""We're the poster child of how tariffs did not keep domestic production in place,"" said Matt Priest, CEO of the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America, pointing out that 99% of shoes are now imported.""We will be out there engaging with policy members and discussing how tariffs are paid by American consumers.""Ocean container shipping market rates spiked more than 70% after the Trump Administration announced new tariffs in 2018. The off-contract spot rate to ship a 40-foot (12.19-meter) container on the busy trade route from China to the US West Coast jumped 75% to $2,604 between Jan. 1 and Nov. 1 that year, Xeneta said.The tariffs also disrupted supply chains as shippers fought for extra cargo space on vessels, trucks and trains, while the landed goods swamped ports and warehouses, leading to higher prices for everything from furniture and footwear to steel.Ocean freight rates are already elevated due to ongoing Iran-backed Houthi attacks on ships near the Suez Canal trade shortcut. That pressure, combined with a recent surge in holiday goods and industrial material imports recently sent the cost to ferry a 40-foot container from Shanghai to New York to $10,000.","US presidential contender Donald Trump has floated plans for blanket tariffs of 10% to 20% on virtually all imports.
