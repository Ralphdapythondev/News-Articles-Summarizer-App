Budget 2024 expectations : Ahead of the upcoming Union Budget 2024 presentation on July 23 by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman , the government is weighing a proposal to significantly raise the minimum guaranteed amount under its flagship social security initiative , the Atal Pension Yojana (APY).Currently, the scheme offers a guaranteed minimum pension ranging from Rs 1,000 to Rs 5,000 per month, depending on the subscriber's contributions.However, according to an ET report, in a move aimed at enhancing social security benefits, the Modi government is contemplating doubling this amount to Rs 10,000 per month. The decision on this proposal is expected closer to the budget date.The potential hike in APY benefits comes amidst efforts to strengthen India's social security framework, aligning with the imminent rollout of the labour code on social security.As of June 20, the Atal Pension Yojana has garnered over 66.2 million enrolments, with 12.2 million new accounts added in the fiscal year 2023-24 alone.""Some proposals have been made for making the Atal Pension Yojana more attractive, including increasing the guaranteed amount. These are being examined,"" commented an official.Also Read | Budget 2024: Insurance cover under Ayushman Bharat PMJAY scheme to be doubled to Rs 10 lakh? Earlier this year, Deepak Mohanty, Chairman of the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA), highlighted the need to enhance the guaranteed pension amount, citing concerns over its adequacy in meeting future needs.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has previously underscored APY's success in targeting the poor and lower-middle-class segments, noting the scheme's deliberate design to ensure widespread affordability and accessibility.Introduced as part of the National Pension System (NPS), Atal Pension Yojana allows subscribers to exit the scheme at the age of 60, with options for annuitisation of pension wealth upon retirement. Notably, individuals liable to pay income tax are excluded from enrolling in the scheme, reinforcing its focus on supporting economically disadvantaged groups.","The government is weighing a proposal to significantly raise the minimum guaranteed amount under its flagship social security initiative, the Atal Pension Yojana.

The Vizhinjam International Sea Port , India's largest transhipment port in Kerala, has welcomed its first container ship, a large cargo vessel named 'San Fernando' from China. The ship's arrival was celebrated with a water salute by four tugs that guided it to the dock, marking a significant milestone for India's largest transhipment port.The ship, with a capacity of 8,000 to 9,000 TEUs, is owned by the prominent shipping company Maersk and arrived from Xiamen Port in China.The 300-meter-long San Fernando is set to unload 1,900 containers at Vizhinjam International Seaport Limited (VISL).The mothership carries large containers that will be transferred to other vessels and subsequently transported to various ports within the country and internationally.Vizhinjam, equipped with state-of-the-art equipment and advanced automation and IT systems, is poised to become India's first semi-automated port.Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd (APSEZ) is responsible for the development of the Vizhinjam International Seaport. Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan acknowledged Adani Group's commitment to completing the project within the stipulated timeframe.The port's construction, which commenced in 2016, is a public-private partnership project with a total investment of Rs 8,867 crore. The Kerala state government contributed approximately Rs 5,595 crore, while the central government provided Rs 818 crore towards the port's development.

Budget 2024 income tax expectations: Why new tax regime is likely to be made more attractive,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2024-income-tax-expectations-why-new-tax-regime-is-likely-to-be-made-more-attractive/articleshow/111717575.cms,"By Tanu Gupta

Popularizing the New and Simplified Personal Tax Regime

Increasing the standard deduction

Direct payment of income tax refund to overseas bank accounts

(The author is Partner Mainstay Tax Advisors LLP. Views expressed are personal)

Budget 2024 income tax expectations : Increase in the limits of various exemptions and deductions is one of the prime expectations of the individual taxpayers from any Union Budget. But with the current government’s focus on a simplified tax regime with minimal exemptions and deductions, do the taxpayers need to adjust their old-time favorite expectation ? Should the taxpayer expect tax reliefs in the New Tax Regime instead ? Either way, the individual taxpayers have high hopes from this Budget, especially in the absence of any tax proposals announced in the interim budget in Feb 2024.In this article, I list some of the expectations of individual taxpayers from the Union Budget 2024 to be presented on 23 July 2024.A New Personal Tax Regime was introduced in Budget 2020 which was simple, in the sense that it allowed for very limited exemptions and deductions. To increase the takers for this regime and make it more tax beneficial for them, the Government then brought several changes in the new regime. Such as allowing standard deduction , higher basic exemption limit of Rs 3 lakh (as against Rs 2.5 lakh in the old regime), wider tax slabs, reduced surcharge from 37% to 25% on incomes above Rs 5 crore, nil tax liability for individuals with incomes up to Rs 7 lakh etc.The government further made it a default tax regime w.e.f. FY 2023-24, continuing to move to its vision of a simplified tax system in India.Marching towards the same goal, I expect that the government may propose further changes in the regime, to attract even those taxpayers who are still opting for the old tax regime. This may involve either further relaxing the slabs by widening them or restructuring them. Currently, 30% tax rate is applicable on incomes above Rs 15 lakh. The government may increase the same to Rs 20 lakh.Also Read | Budget 2024: Government may offer guarantee under NPS to allay fears Standard deduction is a vanilla / blanket tax deduction allowed to the salaried taxpayers, irrespective of the expenses or investments done by them.To provide further tax relief to the salaried taxpayers while keeping the tax system simple, I expect that the government may increase the standard deduction from Rs 50,000 to Rs 75,000 under the new tax regime.The income tax return form provides for mentioning the foreign bank account for direct credit of income tax refund, where the Non-Resident taxpayer does not have an Indian bank account. However, practically, such a facility is not yet active and the refunds cannot be credited to the foreign bank account for the NR taxpayer.Also Read | Income Tax expectations Budget 2024: Tax exempt limit for savings account interest to be raised to Rs 25,000? With a focus to improve taxpayer services and increasing use of technology and digital platforms in the tax system, I hope that the government activates the facility of direct credit of tax refund to foreign bank accounts.With India on its track to “Viksit Bharat” by 2047, and with a high growth target, the Government may put more disposable income in the hands of taxpayers, so as to further fuel consumption and growth of the economy. Therefore, one may expect some tax reliefs in the Union Budget 2024, however, they may continue to be along the same theme followed in earlier budgets – simplifying and rationalizing the India tax system!","Budget 2024 income tax expectations: Increase in the limits of various exemptions and deductions is one of the prime expectations of the individual taxpayers from any Union Budget.

How Kayathri recovered from a terrible tragedy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/times-techies/how-kayathri-recovered-from-a-terrible-tragedy/articleshow/111797095.cms,"Kayathri Karuppasamy ’s life changed dramatically when her husband passed away suddenly when they were living in the UK. Kayathri had quit her job at HCLTech as a software engineer in 2014 to move to the UK with her husband. It wasn’t easy finding a job in the country at the time. “There are multiple rounds of interviews even for junior roles,” she says.After two years of job search, she managed to find one, but it wasn’t a technical role.It was also a very basic job – she just had to validate licences of products. But Kayathri continued so that she would not stay idle. It was also an opportunity to learn from colleagues.A year into the job, she had a baby and she quit her job.The tragedy struck two years later, in 2019. Kayathri had to return to India. She had to fend for her daughter and herself. With her parents and in-laws helping to take care of the baby, Kayathri was able to start taking online and offline courses in data science and Python.“For a year, I was just figuring out what to do. At one point, I thought of skilling in testing, but figured the work hours would not be conducive. Testers must work late, which was not an option for me,” says Kayathri.Kayathri looked for a job as a Mainframe developer, which was her role before moving to the UK. But this was a niche skill, and there weren’t many openings in the market.Like most people with a break, Kayathri too had trouble finding a job despite her skills. She would clear the technical interview rounds by demonstrating how to write code, but thecareer gap was a hurdle at all the five firms she applied to.“HRs would invariably ask me about the gap. They did not view it well,” she says.During this phase, she even considered studying to sit for a bank job exam, because she felt it would give her time in the evenings to be with her child. But she did not meet the age bar.The turning point came when she discovered Bounteous’ return-to-work programme. Bounteous is a US-based digital experience consultancy. “Bounteous was the only firm that focused on my technical skills and my seven years of IT experience, and not my four-year break,” Kayathri says.The Covid pandemic enabled a smooth transition, because she got to work from home for some years. Now, with offices fully open, Kayathri lives in Chennai with her daughter. There is a house help who looks after the child.Bounteous initially put her on a three-month training course where she learned new technologies along with others who came with career gaps. This period helped her get into a project knowing the work culture and technical requirements.She advises mothers who want to return to work not to compromise on their requirements while on the job hunt, be it work hours, wanting to work from home, or the role. “Believe in yourself,” she says.","Kayathri Karuppasamy had quit her job at HCLTech as a software engineer in 2014 to move to the UK with her husband.

Budget 2024: Why Modi government is likely to maintain disinvestment and dividend targets of close to Rs 1 lakh crore,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2024-why-modi-government-is-likely-to-maintain-disinvestment-and-dividend-targets-of-close-to-rs-1-lakh-crore/articleshow/111780424.cms,"Outlook for FY25

Analysts' Perspective

Budget 2024 expectations : The Modi government is likely to maintain its revenue collection targets of nearly Rs 1 lakh crore for the fiscal year 2024-25 (FY25) through disinvestment , asset monetization, and dividends from non-financial Central Public Sector Enterprises ( CPSEs ), according to senior officials.The interim budget presented in February combined disinvestment and asset monetisation under the 'miscellaneous capital receipts' category, instead of listing them separately, according to an ET report.This change pegged the combined realisation for the current fiscal at Rs 50,000 crore, up from the revised estimate of Rs 30,000 crore for FY24.Additionally, another Rs 48,000 crore was expected from dividends from non-financial CPSEs and entities where the government holds minority stakes. The actual dividend collections have surpassed initial estimates for the third consecutive year, reaching a new high of Rs 63,749 crore in FY24, approximately 27.5% higher than the revised estimate of Rs 50,000 crore.This remarkable performance, as noted by the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM), reflects the robust health of state-run firms across various sectors. Disinvestment and asset monetization also showed strong results, with proceeds totaling Rs 16,507 crore and Rs 16,000 crore respectively, beating the combined revised target of Rs 30,000 crore for FY24.Also Read | Budget 2024 income tax expectations: Top 5 things FM Sitharaman should do for taxpayers - from tax slab changes to hiking standard deduction Despite these successes, the government is not inclined to increase its revenue targets for FY25 from the levels set in the interim budget, the rationale being to guard against presenting ""estimates that will fall short of actual realisations and upset resource allocation plans,"" in the words of an official.A final decision on the specific asset monetisation target will be made closer to the budget presentation on July 23. The government anticipates significant proceeds from the planned privatisation of IDBI Bank and divestments in Shipping Corporation of India and NMDC Steel, among others, in FY25.Analysts at CareEdge Ratings have noted that with a substantial dividend of Rs 2.11 lakh crore from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the government's fiscal position remains robust, potentially reducing the urgency to aggressively pursue divestments.The combined target for divestment and asset monetisation represents just 1.6% of the government’s budgeted non-debt receipts for FY25, indicating a reduced reliance on these revenues to manage the fiscal deficit.Also Read | Budget 2024: Top 3 steps Modi government should consider for employment generation However, CareEdge analysts have identified a significant disinvestment potential of about Rs 11.5 lakh crore at current market valuations, assuming the government maintains at least a 51% stake in public firms and offloads excess shares.DIPAM Secretary Tuhin Kanta Pandey had previously emphasised that setting overly high annual disinvestment targets could create market uncertainties and adversely impact the value creation strategy for the CPSEs. Therefore, the government is committed to a ""calibrated disinvestment strategy"" to optimise outcomes, he said.","The Modi government is likely to maintain its revenue collection targets of nearly Rs 1 lakh crore for the fiscal year 2024-25 (FY25) This is through disinvestment, asset monetization, and dividends from non-financial Central Public Sector Enterprises ( CPSEs ), according to senior officials.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111780695,imgsize-49796,width-400,resizemode-4/111780695.jpg"

Standard Deduction

limit:

4. Tax Benefits for Home Buyers:

5. Enhancement of long-term capital gains exemption limit

Other procedural amendments

Currently, home buyers who purchase property from non-residents (NR) are required to compute the income of the seller and deduct appropriate tax on such income. This casts an onerous obligation on the individual home buyers. In fact they are also required to obtain Tax Deduction Account (TAN) and file quarterly withholding tax returns. Contrast this with the situation where the seller is a resident – they buyer simply has to deduct 1 percent TDS on sales proceeds and file a challan-cum return without obtaining a TAN. A similar system, with a higher rate of TDS say 2 or 5 per cent, may be introduced for buyers of residential property from a NR taxpayer. Electric vehicles (EV) are the future. In line with the ESG agenda of the organization, many employers are encouraging employees to consider an EV in their employer car lease arrangement. However, the current perquisite rules provide for valuation only based on the cubic capacity of the car. Hence, it may be prudent for the Government to specific a separate value for EVs as well.

Budget 2024 income tax expectations : The Finance Minister (FM) will present the full Union Budget for Financial Year (FY) 2024-25 in Parliament on July 23rd. The Budget is of significant interest to individual taxpayers as they have a long wish list of the desired announcements on the personal tax front from the newly formed government.Some of the heightened expectations are as under:It is anticipated that the government may raise the income tax exemption limit to Rs 5 lakh from the current Rs 3 lakh limit under the new tax regime in the upcoming Budget. The new tax regime is the default tax regime now. However, there are taxpayers still opting for the old tax regime to avail of HRA exemption, 80C deduction, etc. Hence, this increase in the basic exemption limit would provide even further encouragement for taxpayers to opt for the new tax regime. This would provide more disposable income in the hands of the salaried/pensioned taxpayers, thereby stimulating economic activity and consumption, without complex investment/ expenditure related conditions.In the last year’s budget, the FM effected some major changes in the new tax regime to attract taxpayers towards the same. A full tax rebate was also announced on taxable income up to Rs 7 lakh. This year, there is a further expectation for an increase in such a rebate to Rs 7.5 lakh. Such adjustment would provide much-needed relief to middle-income taxpayers, potentially boosting spending and investment.Also Read | Budget 2024 income tax expectations: Why new tax regime is likely to be made more attractive For salaried individuals, exemption towards medical reimbursement and conveyance allowance was done away with a few years ago in lieu of introduction of standard deduction. To keep pace with the ever-rising medical cost and the fuel cost, the standard deduction may be increased from the existing limit of Rs 50,000 to at least Rs 1 lakh.To boost the momentum in the real estate sector, one can expect an increase in tax benefits for home buyers. This could include increased deduction on home loan interest or principal repayment. Currently, the overall limit to claim loss under the head income from house property is restricted to Rs 2 lakhs p.a. This limit should be revisited and enhanced to, say Rs 3 lakhs p.a., to provide further impetus to the ‘housing for all’ initiative.Effective FY 2018-19, Long-term Capital Gains (‘LTCG’) exceeding Rs 1 lakh earned from transfer of equity shares of a company or a unit of an equity oriented mutual funds on which Securities Transaction Tax (STT) has been paid at the time of acquisition, are subject to taxation at 10 per cent, without the indexation benefit. To boost investor confidence and incentivize infusion of further investment into the capital market, the Government may evaluate to increase the existing exemption limit from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 2 lakh.Also Read | ITR filing FY 2023-24: Confused between old & new tax regime?

Budget 2024 expectations : India’s robust automotive industry is accelerating through a landscape transitioning in terms of demand, policy and technology. Given these variables, Budget 2024 will be crucial for the industry for three reasons.One, while the industry was rebounding after the Covid-19 pandemic, passenger and commercial vehicles faced growth hurdles, such as supply-chain disruptions, semiconductor shortage and a steep rise in commodity prices.Then in fiscal 2023 pent-up demand gushed forth and continued to chug along last fiscal. The industry could thus shake off degrowth and low-capacity utilization. Yet, recovery in a few segments continues to lag with volumes far below the pandemic levels. The right impetus will thus be key to accelerate all segments.Two, the industry is navigating a technological overhaul. The advancements, collectively known as CASE (connected, autonomous, shared and electric), will lead to cleaner powertrains, added safety, and connected and autonomous features. These consider vehicles as a shared service rather than assets for ownership.At the same time, transmission, mechanical and electronic systems are also becoming more advanced.The industry is taking the disruption head-on — electrification has gained traction this year and the share of other cleaner technologies such as hybrid and compressed natural gas has increased. However, futuristic technologies, including flex fuel, hydrogen and fuel cell, will need propulsion to translate into commercial reality. Long-term policy clarity on that front will help industry navigate through short-term bumps.Three, the structural nature of the automotive industry itself demands that it remain robust. It supports multiple sectors as part of its long value chain. Major industries such as steel, rubber, plastics, electronics, and other semi-processed and intermediary components are critical end-users. Retailing, servicing, banking, insurance, fueling, charging, logistics and personal and commercial mobility are some important forward linkages.Given this milieu, we believe the budget should focus on the following measures:It could restore the benefit of a higher deduction of 200%, as earlier. Such benefits are available to companies in many geographies, especially the ones in South Asia.The government’s focus on infrastructure should continue. It has a multiplier effect not only on employment, thereby generating income prospects, but also creates significant opportunities for EPC (engineering, procurement and construction) players/contractors, increasing demand for steel and cement and investments thereof. This will help bolster the commercial vehicles industry segment through higher sales and logistics service providers with better turnaround time on account of improved road infrastructure, thereby supporting the objective of reducing the logistics cost.The scrapping policy is a step in the right direction. But the government needs to put in place adequate incentives for owners to scrap their older vehicles. Today, owners scrapping older vehicles are unlikely to afford new ones if there is no income security. So, they would tend to purchase pre-owned vehicles rather than new ones. The current incentives are just not lucrative enough to scrap vehicles. However, the right kind will help shrink the aging on-road fleet, reduce the proportion of BSI to BS-IV vehicles and lower emissions.Two-wheelers and commercial vehicles using alternative fuels (cargo vehicles, including three-wheelers L5 category and passenger segment for mass public commute and goods movement) can be made eligible for goods and services tax (GST) rationalization. The dual GST rate for auto components, i.e., 18% and 28%, encourages grey market distribution in the aftermarket space. This is a safety hazard on the one hand and an incentive to the informal economy and loss to GST revenue on the other. Hence, it would make sense to have one GST rate for all auto components at 18%.FAME-2 was extended for two years but ended in March 2024; the Electric Mobility Promotion Scheme (EMPS) ends in July. The government will need to announce longer-term policy support for the electric vehicles (EV) industry in the budget. The consistency in its structure and fewer frequent changes by the government would reduce confusion, thereby enabling increased private sector capex. Inclusion of private players for charging infrastructure and light, medium and heavy commercial vehicles under the policy will also help proliferate EV adoption in India. The focus should also be to remove the challenges/issues currently existing to install chargers at a community level.The automotive tyre industry caters to local demand and has the potential to become a large foreign exchange earner for India. New technologies such as run-flat tyre, smart tyres, noise reduction, puncture-proof and tyres for EVs, have been introduced in this industry as well. These advancements require companies to invest heavily in capex and R&D. Extending the PLI scheme to tyres would be a welcome step for the industry and help it become more competitive vis-à-vis China, Thailand and Vietnam in the exports market.Rupee trade with developing countries that are curtailing imports due to foreign exchange/dollar crisis and are important trade partners such as Egypt, Nigeria and Turkey will help maintain exports. Also, high trade deficit countries from which India imports, such as the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Iran and Iraq, do not manufacture automobiles. Free trade agreements with these countries would also help boost automobile exports.The introduction of Section 80EEB in the Income Tax Act in 2019 allowed a deduction of up to Rs 1.5 lakh per annum on interest paid for EV loans. This was a significant step, but the benefit was not extended beyond March 2023. Re-introducing the same and raising the deduction to Rs 2 lakh a year will encourage EV adoption.Any further enhancement in deductions under section 80 will help improve/increase disposable incomes in the hands of people, improving buying power and supporting sales of discretionary items, including automobiles.Taking these actionable steps in the budget can go a long way in boosting India’s automotive industry.","India’s robust automotive industry is accelerating through a landscape transitioning in terms of demand, policy and technology.

1. Boosting Consumption: Income Tax Changes Expected

2. Enhancing Social Sector Spending

3. Promoting Manufacturing

5. Establishing a Medium-Term Economic Vision

Brokerages such as Nomura anticipate a clear message of policy continuity and a robust commitment to fiscal consolidation.Nomura analysts Sonal Varma and Aurodeep Nandi predict that the government will lower its fiscal deficit target for FY25 from 5.1% to 5% of GDP. This adjustment would signal the government’s determination to maintain fiscal stability, even in the face of a weakened political mandate. The emphasis on fiscal discipline is expected to be a cornerstone of this year’s Budget, according to an ET report quoting Nomura.To stimulate consumer demand, the government may consider increasing the standard deduction limit for taxpayers under the new tax regime, which offers lower rates without exemptions. There could also be a rise in the exemption threshold for income derived from bank interest. Furthermore, a reduction in personal income tax rates for individuals earning between Rs 5 lakh and Rs 15 lakh is on the table, Nomura said, quoting reports.Also Read | Budget 2024 income tax expectations: Why new tax regime is likely to be made more attractive The Budget is likely to prioritize the rural sector by boosting allocations for various schemes. This includes an increase in subsidies for housing, estimated at Rs 23,000 crore (approximately 0.07% of GDP), along with enhanced funding for rural roads and employment initiatives. Additionally, the government might expand the public health insurance program and rejuvenate the Lakhpati Didi economic empowerment initiative for women.Nomura anticipates that the government will reaffirm its commitment to domestic manufacturing. Potential measures include raising the minimum local content requirement for public procurement, reinstating the 15% concessional corporate tax rate for new manufacturing facilities, and revising the 2019 policy on integrating the electronics global value chain.

Nomura forecasts an increase in the total capex outlay to 3.5% of GDP, up from 3.4% in the interim Budget. In response to state demands, the government might also enhance the unconditional transfers under the 50-year interest-free loan scheme for infrastructure projects.This Budget marks the first significant financial roadmap following the recent elections, making it a critical opportunity for the government to lay out its medium-term economic vision.

"'Just like real': Bill Gates-backed startup makes butter out of air, claims it tastes really good",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/just-like-real-bill-gates-backed-startup-makes-butter-out-of-air-claims-it-tastes-really-good/articleshow/111782626.cms,"A startup based in California , has claimed to have developed a process for creating butter without the use of milk or any other dairy product.The company, named Savor , backed by Microsoft founder Bill Gates said it produces butter using a combination of carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and oxygen chains, and asserts that the resulting product ""tastes like the real thing"", as reported by The Guardian.Savor has been conducting experiments to create dairy-free alternatives for various products, including ice-cream, cheese, and milk. The company employs a thermochemical process that enables them to develop fat molecules using gases, rather than relying on traditional dairy sources.The livestock industry is responsible for a significant portion of global greenhouse gas emissions , accounting for 14.5 percent according to the United Nations.Reducing the consumption of meat and dairy products is considered one of the essential ways to mitigate the environmental impact of this industry.Savor has said that their products will have a substantially lower carbon footprint compared to their animal-based counterparts.Real butter has a carbon footprint of 16.9kg CO2 equivalent per kg, while the butter created by Savor has a carbon footprint of less than 0.8g CO2 equivalent per kg, highlighting the potential environmental benefits of this innovative approach todairy-free butter production, as reported by The Guardian.Backing this idea on his blogpost, Bill Gates wrote: ""It might sound like a pipe dream, but a company called Savor (which I’m invested in) is in the process of doing it. They started with the fact that all fats are made of varying chains of carbon and hydrogen atoms. Then they set out to make those same carbon and hydrogen chains—without involving animals or plants. They ultimately developed a process that involves taking carbon dioxide from the air and hydrogen from water, heating them up, and oxidizing them to trigger the separation of fatty acids and then the formulation of fat. The result is real fat molecules like the ones we get from milk, cheese, and vegetable oils.""“The process doesn’t release any greenhouse gases, and it uses no farmland and less than a thousandth of the water that traditional agriculture does. And most important, it tastes really good – like the real thing, because chemically it is,” he c.""The idea of switching to lab-made fats and oils may seem strange at first. But their potential to significantly reduce our carbon footprint is immense. By harnessing proven technologies and processes, we get one step closer to achieving our climate goals,"" he added.However the Savor's butter, crafted through innovative techniques, is not yet ready for commercial distribution.Savor's chief executive, Kathleen Alexander said: “We are currently pre-commercial and working through regulatory approval to be able to sell our butter. We are not expecting to be able to move forward with any kind of sales until at least 2025. So far, we had informal taste panels with tens of people. We expect to perform a more formal panel as part of our commercialisation and scale-up efforts.”","California-based startup Savor claims to have developed a process for creating butter without the use of milk or any other dairy product.

China making youth unemployment a 'top priority',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/china-making-youth-unemployment-a-top-priority/articleshow/111772468.cms,"'Policy shift under way'

'Lower expectations'

SHANGHAI: At a job fair for soon-to-be graduates in central Shanghai, recruiters sat bored under washed-out tarpaulins as rain and an apparent lack of interest kept potential young employees away.The empty seats belied China's stubbornly high youth unemployment rate -- a problem so pressing that President Xi Jinping has told top Communist Party (CCP) cadres it should be a ""top priority"".His words have been seen by many analysts as a signal that reforms could be in the pipeline ahead of the ongoing Third Plenum, a meeting that has historically unveiled important changes in economic policy direction.Youth unemployment stood at 14.2% in May, official data showed -- and last month, another 11.8 million students graduated from university, adding to the bottleneck.That number had soared to an unprecedented 21.3% in mid-2023 before officials paused publishing monthly figures. They began releasing them again in December after adjusting the calculation method.Hospitality and human resources firms dominated the small job fair in late May, one of many hosted by local authorities in anticipation of an influx of university leavers.""It's difficult to find a job that matches your degree and aspirations,"" one of the few young jobseekers at the fair, a data sciences student, told AFP.""Lots of college students actually have too high expectations,"" said Julia Shao, who was recruiting for a restaurant chain.""They do not prefer this kind of basic position. They prefer... a fancy job.""Xi specifically mentioned graduates in a speech to the CCP Politburo in May, noting that ""more jobs should be created for them to apply what they have learned and what they are adept at"".His remarks follow ""a steady drumbeat of comments from China's leadership underlining the urgency"" of the matter, Erica Tay, director of macro research at Maybank, told AFP.The issue has been hanging over the government for some time.Together with persistently low consumption and a long-running property sector crisis, the unemployment situation has been labelled a key culprit for China's uneven post-pandemic recovery.""While details in Xi's comments are vague, it's clear a policy shift is under way,"" said Harry Murphy Cruise of Moody's Analytics.""We expect policies aimed at reducing youth unemployment to be a key pillar of the discussions (at the Third Plenum).""Xi has said young people should be encouraged ""to find jobs or start businesses in key fields (and) industries"".""Market-oriented and social channels should be expanded for young people to find a job,"" he was quoted as saying.Murphy Cruise said he expected the government to increase wage subsidies to persuade companies to hire recent graduates, as well as create more work placements for students.However, these were only ""band-aid solutions"", he said.In the long term, ""larger industrial and education policy reforms"" were needed to ensure a better match between graduates' skills and employer demands, he said.There is now a push to fill roles that ""dovetail with key policy priorities"" or where skills shortages exist, said Tay, like industrial upgrading and scientific innovation.With job opportunities drying up for those holding sociology, journalism and law degrees, she said, some kind of ""government-sponsored earn-as-you-learn training programmes"" might be needed to fill more in-demand roles.Near the law faculty of a top Shanghai university, final-year students said the job market was indeed tough.""Post-pandemic, it is a little more difficult than before,"" 22-year-old Qian Le said, referencing recent layoffs and pay cuts at top Chinese law firms.""Even those who are already in jobs may not be able to keep them, so it may be more difficult for new people to get in.""Qian and her classmate Wang Hui had both opted to pursue further study.""The economic situation is quite sluggish, many companies have gone bankrupt, and many jobs have been reduced,"" Wang told AFP.China's once-freewheeling private sector has slowed significantly, in part because of past government crackdowns on companies including tech giants and private tutoring firms.Many young people are opting to study for civil service exams -- seen as a more stable option -- or like Wang and Qian, taking on post-graduate degrees.In March, universities urged their students to actively look for jobs instead, said Tay.But ""competition is huge, and the number of undergraduates is gradually increasing every year"", Wang said.Karl Hu, another law student, said the difficulty was not in finding a job.The problem was finding ""a suitable career"" in terms of salary level and benefits, he explained.He himself had secured a good job at a bank, he said -- but many would have to ""lower their expectations"".","Youth unemployment stood at 14.2% in May, official data showed.

"From Elon Musk to David Sacks, Silicon Valley’s Trump backers cheer JD Vance as VP pick",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/from-elon-musk-to-david-sacks-silicon-valleys-trump-backers-cheer-jd-vance-as-vp-pick/articleshow/111768711.cms,"Major Silicon Valley investors hailed Donald Trump ’s choice of Ohio senator and former venture capitalist JD Vance as his running mate, a move that puts the technology industry closer to center stage in Washington if the former president takes the White House in November. Elon Musk called the decision a “great choice” and said the lineup “resounds with victory” on X, the social platform he owns.David Sacks , an investor and Trump supporter scheduled to speak at the GOP convention on Monday night, called Vance an “American patriot” in a post.And at Founders Fund, a venture capital firm backed by billionaire Peter Thiel, partner Delian Asparouhov summed up the mood of many in his orbit, posting: “IT’S JD VANCE. WE HAVE A FORMER TECH VC IN THE WHITE HOUSE. GREATEST COUNTRY ON EARTH BABY.”The Silicon Valley tech industry has long been a liberal bastion nestled in California, a Democratic stronghold, with roots in deeply progressive San Francisco. But a Republican contingent within tech has recently become increasingly visible, with major players like Musk, Sacks and Shaun Maguire from Sequoia Capital throwing their endorsements and donations to Trump for his White House bid against President Joe Biden .Representatives for Thiel and Founders Fund didn’t provide comment on the announcement.After graduating from Yale Law School, Vance in 2016 became a principal at Mithril Capital Management, a venture firm backed by Thiel, where he served a relatively brief stint. In 2017, he joined the Steve Case-backed firm Revolution LLC in Washington, as a partner focusing on startups. In 2019, he moved back to Ohio and formed Narya Capital. Taking a page from Thiel’s book, Vance made a Lord of the Rings reference with his new firm, naming Narya after a ring worn by the wizard Gandalf in the books. Narya was backed by Thiel, alongside other big-name investors including Eric Schmidt and Marc Andreessen.Vance’s proximity to the tech industry has thrilled even former Democrats in tech. One supporter is Chamath Palihapitiya, a former donor to Hillary Clinton who appears alongside Sacks on the tech podcast All In, where the hosts refer to each other as besties. After Trump’s announcement about Vance, he tweeted, “A Bestie adjacent as the VP?!?!?! ????????????????”Crystal McKellar, founder and managing partner of Aloft VC, worked with Vance at Mithril Capital in 2012 and greeted the news enthusiastically.“He will be good for Silicon Valley because he is a good free market capitalist who believes in growth and innovation and eliminating the regulation that strangles growth,” she said in a text. “And he’ll be good for the country for all the same reasons and because he feels genuine compassion for those forgotten and left behind by progress.”Matt Murphy, a partner at Menlo Ventures, said that while he didn’t know Vance, 39, or his positions well, his pick was an encouraging sign. “I think having somebody who understands tech is great,” Murphy said. “We actually have a young candidate who seems to be tech savvy. I think it’s good for the party.”Vance has had a somewhat complicated relationship with Silicon Valley. During his successful campaign for the Senate in 2022, which was backed by Thiel, he was critical of big tech companies, saying that they wield too much power and influence over politics. He argued that his background has positioned him to take on the “big tech oligarchy.”Vance has also cheered the Biden administration’s tech-focused antitrust enforcement, especially Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan. This sets Vance apart from Chamber of Commerce-type Republicans who have consistently criticized Khan’s broad interpretation of existing antitrust law to prosecute tech companies that don’t fit the profile of historic monopolies.“I look at Lina Khan as one of the few people in the Biden administration that I think is actually doing a pretty good job,” Vance said at a conference in February.But while Vance’s criticism of large tech players may rankle some in the industry, it’s similar to sentiments expressed by smaller ones. Startups and venture capitalists have long complained that the size and power of big tech players had made it difficult for small companies to compete. VC firm Andreessen Horowitz has nicknamed the startup world “Little Tech,” and pointed out the difference in priorities between small companies and bigger firms.Vance has also taken on Wall Street in other ways, backing legislation with Elizabeth Warren to claw back pay for bank executives when their institutions fail, and railroad companies with his Trump-endorsed safety bill with Democratic Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown after the East Palestine disaster.He also bucked his party in leading support for the extension of an expired Biden program providing subsidies for broadband access for millions of people. Those bipartisan efforts had earned him plaudits from Democrats but didn’t succeed in getting bills enacted into law.","The Silicon Valley tech industry has long been a liberal bastion nestled in California, with roots in deeply progressive San Francisco.

Consumers in the United States and Europe have become more cautious due to rising living costs, while demand in China has been dampened by a property crisis and record-high youth unemployment.Meanwhile, the brand also warned that based on current trends, it would fall short of annual profit forecasts and would forgo this year's dividend to invest in growth initiatives.The British brand has been undergoing a turnaround process for some time, with several leadership changes.

US West Texas Intermediate crude stood at $82.41 a barrel, up 20 cents, or 0.2 per cent.Oil prices shrugged off the impact from the dollar, which firmed after a failed assassination bid on US presidential candidate Donald Trump.""I don't think you can ignore the uncertainty that the weekend's assassination attempt will cast across a deeply divided country in the lead-up to the election,"" said IG market analyst Tony Sycamore.In the Middle East, talks on ending the Gaza conflict between Israel and Hamas halted on Saturday after three days, though a Hamas official said the following day it had not withdrawn from discussions.However, an Israeli attack targeting the group's military leader killed 90 people on Saturday.The uncertainty around the volatile situation has kept the geopolitical premium in oil elevated.Oil markets are also broadly underpinned by supply cuts from OPEC+ with Iraq's oil ministry saying it will compensate for any overproduction since the beginning of 2024.Last week, Brent fell more than 1.7% after four weeks of gains while WTI futures slid 1.1% as a fall in China's crude imports, the world's top importer, countered robust summer consumption in the United States.""While fundamentals are still supportive, there are growing demand concerns, largely emanating from China,"" ING analysts led by Warren Patterson said in a note.China's crude oil imports fell 2.3% in the first half of this year to 11.05 million barrels a day, amid disappointing fuel demand and as independent refiners cut output due to weak profit margins.Crude throughput at Chinese refineries fell 3.7% in June from a year earlier to 14.19 million bpd, the year's lowest so far, customs data showed on Monday.China's economy slowed in the second quarter as a protracted property downturn and job insecurity weighed on domestic demand, keeping alive expectations Beijing will need to unleash more stimulus.In the United States, active oil rig count, an early indicator of future output, fell by one to 478 last week, the lowest since December 2021, energy services firm Baker Hughes said on Friday.","Brent crude futures rose 15 cents, or 0.2 per cent, to $85.18 a barrel.

Industrial production increased 5.3% on year in June, versus economists’ forecast of 5%

Retail sales rose 2%, compared with a predicted growth of 3.4%

Fixed-asset investment gained 3.9% in the first six months, matching an expected 3.9% increase. Contraction in the property sector continued, with investment slumping 10.1% in the period

The urban jobless rate was unchanged at 5% last month from May

China’s economic growth fell to the worst pace in five quarters as retail sales slowed, piling pressure on Beijing to boost confidence at a twice-a-decade policy meeting unfolding this week.Gross domestic product expanded 4.7% in the second quarter from the same period a year earlier, data released by the National Bureau of Statistics showed Monday.That missed the median estimate of 5.1% in a Bloomberg survey of economists. Growth in the first half was 5%, in line with Beijing’s annual target of around 5%.The slowdown reflected in the data — the first set of quarterly indicators free of distortions by the pandemic — could strengthen calls for Beijing to ramp up efforts to stimulate growth. They were published the same day President Xi Jinping was set to convene the third plenum meeting to set major economic and political policies for the coming years.China needs to “fully estimate difficulties, challenges and uncertainties in development” while strengthening confidence in the economy going forward, and implement macroeconomic policies well to promote a healthy growth, the NBS said in a statement accompanying the release.Retail sales rose at the slowest pace since 2022, underscoring consumers’ reluctance to spend despite a government program to subsidize and encourage the replacement of old vehicles and home appliances.“Amongst all monthly figures released today, the highlight is weak retail sales,” said Raymond Yeung, chief economist for greater China at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group. “Household consumption remains very weak. The ‘replacement’ schemes fail to lift spending. With employers slashing salary and high youth unemployment, households will still be cautious going forward.”Chinese stocks in Hong Kong extended their losses after the disappointing data, with the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index down as much as 1.2%.The disappointing data will likely draw more attention to the Third Plenum gathering, where Xi and other top officials are expected to discuss their long-term vision for the world’s second-largest economy.In a sign of the conclave’s importance, the Chinese government skipped a monthly press conference to answer questions on the economic data, opting to only post the figures online. Beijing last disrupted the usual format of a major data release in October 2022, when Xi held a party congress that saw him securing a precedent-defying third term as leader.Economists have called on Chinese authorities to address the property downturn, boost technology self-sufficiency and relieve local fiscal strains during the four-day gathering. The party’s most senior 24 officials including Xi are set to sit down later this month for a Politburo meeting to discuss specific economic measures.China’s efforts to restart its growth engine have so far focused on the supply side, despite domestic demand remaining stubbornly weak as a years-long real estate slump continues to hurt confidence and suppress consumption.The property crisis is expected to remain the biggest overhang for the economy in the coming months, if not years. Exports — a key growth engine this year — also faces uncertainty as Beijing’s trade partners erect new barriers against Chinese goods.The room for the People’s Bank of China to cut rates is limited due to concern of capital flight, pressure on bank profits and a need to defend the yuan. Government spending this year has again lagged the budget as Beijing seeks to reduce local debt risks and officials struggle to find qualified projects to invest in.","Industrial production increased 5.3% on year in June, versus economists’ forecast of 5%.Retail sales rose 2%, compared with a predicted growth of 3.4%.Fixed-asset investment gained 3.9% in the first six months.

"US inflation broadly cools, likely sealing deal for fed rate cut",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-inflation-broadly-cools-likely-sealing-deal-for-fed-rate-cut/articleshow/111667320.cms,"US inflation cooled broadly in June to the slowest pace since 2021 on the back of a long-awaited slowdown in housing costs , sending the strongest signal yet that the Federal Reserve can cut interest rates soon.The so-called core consumer price index — which excludes food and energy costs — climbed 0.1% from May, the smallest advance in three years, Bureau of Labor Statistics figures showed Thursday.The overall measure fell for the first time since the onset of the pandemic, dragged down by cheaper gasoline.Similar to the May CPI report — which Fed Chair Jerome Powell described this week as “really good” following an unexpected flare-up in the first quarter — the June reading will go a long way toward giving Powell and his colleagues the confidence they need to cut rates, likely starting in September. Policymakers will have a chance to signal such a move may be coming when they meet later in July, especially since unemployment has now risen for three straight months.Powell, in testimony before lawmakers this week, avoided signaling the timing of likely rate cuts and insisted policy moves would be guided by incoming data. The Fed chief is set to speak again Monday afternoon in a moderated discussion hosted by the Economic Club of Washington, DC.“We are sufficiently confident — even if the Fed is not yet ready to admit they are — that inflation is on the way back to the 2% target,” Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM US LLP, said in a note. “The road is now open to a rate cut by the Federal Reserve in September.”After the CPI report, Treasuries rallied and traders all but fully priced in September and December rate cuts. They also marked up the odds of a reduction in November to better than even — a move that would come right after the presidential election. Before Thursday, traders and policymakers were divided as to whether there would be just one or two cuts this year.The report also offered encouraging news for President Joe Biden as he prepares for a high-stakes press conference later Thursday amid calls from fellow Democrats for him to step aside as the party’s nominee. The embattled president cheered the data in a statement, saying it shows “significant progress” in the fight against inflation.Metric Actual EstimateCPI MoM -0.1% +0.1%Core CPI MoM +0.1% +0.2%CPI YoY +3.0% +3.1%Core CPI YoY +3.3% +3.4%Shelter prices, which is the largest category within services, climbed 0.2%, the smallest gain since August 2021. Owners’ equivalent rent — a subset of shelter, which is the biggest individual component of the CPI — climbed 0.3%, also the tamest in three years.“Probably the most significant aspect of the June report is the downshift in housing inflation,” said Julia Coronado, the founder of MacroPolicy Perspectives LLC and former Fed economist. “It looks broad-based and durable, and numerous Fed officials have indicated a downshift would boost their confidence that inflation is indeed returning to 2% in a sustainable way.”In addition to slower rent increases, the costs of other services like airfares, hotel stays and inpatient hospital care all declined from a month earlier. New and used vehicle prices led broader decreases in the core goods basket.The BLS noted that the new vehicles index was estimated with fewer prices than in previous months due to a cyberattack that hit thousands of dealerships in June, but software systems have since been restored. “BLS has no further information on when typical data flows will resume and is monitoring the situation closely,” according to the report.Separate figures Thursday showed recurring applications for jobless benefits held near the highest level since late 2021. At the same time, first-time filings fell by 17,000 last week — matching the largest drop in a year — providing some optimism that the job market is holding up.This is a modal window.The media could not be loaded, either because the server or network failed or because the format is not supported.Excluding housing and energy, services prices fell for a second month, according to Bloomberg calculations. While central bankers have stressed the importance of looking at such a metric when assessing the nation’s inflation trajectory, they compute it based on a separate index.That measure, known as the personal consumption expenditures price index, doesn’t put as much weight on shelter as the CPI does. That helps explain why the PCE gauge has been trending closer to the Fed’s 2% target.The PCE measure, released later this month, draws from the CPI as well as certain categories within the producer price index, which is due Friday.The latest results from Delta Air Lines Inc. suggest more scope for services inflation to cool. The carrier’s revenue projections came in weaker than forecast as competition in the domestic market drives ticket prices lower.Meanwhile, a sustained decline in the price of goods over most of the past year has largely been providing some relief to consumers. So-called core goods prices, which exclude food and energy commodities, fell in June for a fourth month.Prices of new vehicles declined for a sixth month, and several apparel categories dropped as well. The cost of household furnishings has fallen nearly every month for the past year.There are also signs that consumers are growing increasingly sensitive to higher prices. Earlier on Thursday, PepsiCo Inc. reported weaker-than-expected revenue growth as budget-focused shoppers weighed on the volume of goods sold. The salty snacks category has been particularly lackluster.A separate report Thursday, combining the inflation data with figures on wages published last week, showed real earnings growth has been positive for the past year.","US inflation cooled broadly in June to the slowest pace since 2021. The slowdown in housing costs is the strongest signal yet that the Federal Reserve can cut interest rates soon.
