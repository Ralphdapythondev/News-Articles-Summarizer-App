Stock market crash an opportunity? The BJP's underwhelming performance in the recent Lok Sabha elections has wiped out nearly all the gains made by the Nifty this year in a single day. On Tuesday, the Nifty plummeted by 1,379 points or 5.93%, yet it continues to trade at a premium valuation compared to other global markets .India's one-year forward earnings multiple of 21.27 is the second highest, trailing only Japan, according to an ET report.India and Japan have both experienced significant market rallies, fueled by India's rapid economic growth and Japan's corporate reforms.In comparison, the Chinese market is currently trading at 11 times its one-year forward earnings, while markets in Singapore, Korea, Hong Kong, and Brazil are trading even lower than China.Foreign investors have withdrawn Rs 50,000 crore from Indian equities so far this year, with a significant portion of these funds being redirected to more affordable markets like China.Aditya Khemka, a fund manager at InCred Asset Management, believes that Tuesday's market correction marks the beginning of a stock picker's market and potentially a prolonged pause for passive investors.""We expect the market to be sideways in the near future and businesses with strong earnings momentum and reasonable valuations to outperform the market,"" he said.","The Nifty plummeted by 1,379 points or 5.93% on Tuesday.

Instead, investors should focus on the fact that the BJP remains the single largest party, and the NDA has the mandate to form the third successive government, ensuring continuity in development reforms and PM Modi's vision for India's future, he says.According to Agarwal, India's economic fundamentals remain strong, with robust GDP growth, substantial foreign exchange reserves, low inflation, and the possibility of interest rate cuts by the RBI.Additionally, good monsoons and positive outlooks from rating agencies contribute to the resilience of the Indian economy. These factors are expected to drive corporate earnings growth, a key driver of stock markets, he says.Also Check | Stock Market Today Live Updates The increasing participation of retail investors in the stock market, evident from the growing number of demat accounts and rising monthly SIP flows, has helped the markets absorb significant FII selling in the recent past.

"How NSA tool helped man crack password after 11 years, recover Rs 25 crore in bitcoins",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/cryptocurrency/bitcoin/how-nsa-tool-helped-man-crack-password-after-11-years-recover-rs-25-crore-in-bitcoins/articleshow/110586982.cms,"NEW DELHI: Security researchers have successfully cracked a password to recover over $3 million worth of Bitcoin that had been stuck in a crypto wallet for 11 years. The wallet contained 43.6 BTC, which had been held there since 2013.Electrical engineer Joe Grand , also known by his handle ‘Kingpin,’ was hired to hack into the encrypted file containing the Bitcoin. The cryptocurrency was protected by a password created by a random password generator called Roboform, but the password had long since been lost. The lost password comprised a series of 20 upper and lower case letters and numbers, designed to be highly secure.“I generated the password, I copied it, put it in the passphrase of the wallet, and also in a text file that I then encrypted,” the wallet’s owner, who chose to remain anonymous, explained in a video published by Mr. Grand. The password was lost after the encrypted part of his computer that held it became corrupted. At the time, the Bitcoin was worth a couple of thousand euros, which the owner described as “painful but OK.”Over the next decade, as the price of Bitcoin rose by more than 20,000 percent, the value of the lost Bitcoin grew into a fortune, prompting the owner to seek help from Mr. Grand. Initially reluctant, Mr. Grand eventually agreed to attempt the recovery, devising a novel method to hack the initial password generator.Using a reverse engineering tool developed by the US National Security Agency (NSA), Mr Grand disassembled the password generator’s code. “In a perfect world, when you generate a password with a password generator, you expect to get a unique, random output each time that no one else has. [But] in this version of RoboForm, it was not the case,” he noted.“While RoboForm’s passwords appear to be randomly generated, they’re not. With the older versions of this software, if we can control the time, we can control the password,” Mr Grand added. He discovered that by tricking the system into believing it was the moment in 2013 when the password was generated, it would recreate the same password.With only a rough idea of when the password was generated, Mr Grand and his colleague Bruno generated millions of potential passwords to eventually crack it. The RoboForm password generator has since updated its platform to improve the randomness of its tool, rendering the time-based hacking approach ineffective for passwords created after 2015.Mr Grand now aims to help more people locked out of their crypto wallets, though he acknowledges that new approaches may be needed. “If this project required hacking time, what dimension are we going to have to hack next?” he remarked.","Security researchers have successfully cracked a password to recover over $3 million worth of Bitcoin that had been stuck in a crypto wallet for 11 years.

The upper layer-tag requires companies to follow a stringent disciplinary structure with a mandatory listing within three years of being notified. Although Tata Motors Finance was also identified as an upper layer NBFC, it told RBI that it should be excluded from the list as it is in the midst of restructuring.In Sept 2023, RBI said that despite qualifying as an upper layer NBFC, Tata Motors Finance is not being included in the list due to its “ongoing business reorganisation”. Besides Tata Capital, its parent Tata Sons is also a part of RBI’s upper layer NBFC list.The Tata Motors Finance-Tata Capital merger is subject to the approval of regulators, shareholders and creditors and will take at least nine months to complete, the group said.","Tata Motors Finance, with assets of Rs 32,500 crore under management, made a profit of Rs 52 crore in FY24.

As a result, BSE’s PSU index is now down nearly 14% in two days.A report by Elara Capital pointed out that PSUs in the capital goods sector have seen a sharp re-rating in their multiples in the past year, driven by asharp increase in order books and elevated profitability and returns. BSE’s PSU index has yielded a return of 121% since the beginning of 2023.The outperformance came on the back of good financial and operational performance, combined with substantial govt support.

Nvidia's stock soared to record highs on Wednesday, propelling the artificial intelligence chipmaker's valuation past the $3 trillion mark and surpassing Apple to become the world's second most valuable company . Nvidia is also preparing to split its stock ten-for-one, effective June 7, a move aimed at increasing its appeal to individual investors.The surge in Nvidia's market value above Apple's marks a significant shift in Silicon Valley, where Apple, co-founded by Steve Jobs, has dominated since the iPhone's launch in 2007. Nvidia's stock rose 5.2% to close at $1,224.40, valuing the company at $3.012 trillion. Meanwhile, Apple's market capitalization stood at $3.003 trillion after its stock climbed 0.8%.""Nvidia is making money on AI right now, and companies like Apple and Meta are spending on AI,"" said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer at Longbow Asset Management. ""It may be a foregone conclusion that Nvidia will overtake Microsoft as well. There's a lot of retail money that's piling in on what they see as a straight shot up.""Nvidia's stock has surged 147% so far in 2024, driven by soaring demand for its top-of-the-line processors.

The company's stock has rallied nearly 30% since May 22, following a stellar revenue forecast.Nvidia added nearly $150 million in market capitalization on Wednesday alone, more than the entire value of AT&T. The optimism surrounding AI also lifted chip stocks broadly, with the PHLX chip index surging 4.5%. Super Micro Computer, which sells AI-optimized servers built with Nvidia chips, climbed 4%.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently received extensive media coverage in Taiwan and was greeted enthusiastically at the Computex tech trade fair in Taipei. Meanwhile, Apple is facing challenges with weak demand for iPhones and stiff competition in China, the world's largest smartphone market. Some investors view Apple as lagging behind other tech giants in integrating AI features into their products and services.Despite Nvidia's impressive gains, analysts' projections for its future earnings have outpaced its stock performance. Nvidia is currently trading at 39 times expected earnings, a significant reduction from a year ago when it traded at over 70 times expected earnings, according to LSEG data.The chipmaker has seen a dramatic increase in demand for its semiconductors, which are crucial for powering AI applications. Nvidia's revenue more than tripled in the latest quarter compared to the same period a year earlier.

Troubled co Byju’s US units face bankruptcy case over $1.2 billion loan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/troubled-co-byjus-us-units-face-bankruptcy-case-over-1-2-billion-loan/articleshow/110752209.cms,"MUMBAI: In a fresh jolt to struggling startup Byju’s, some of its term loan lenders have filed petitions in a US Court, seeking to initiate involuntary Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings against the company’s US subsidiaries Epic, Tynker and Osmo.

Through this move, the lenders are seeking to protect and maximise value of the entities for the benefit of all stakeholders and prevent further diversion of assets, they said in a statement on Wednesday. The three entities were the US-based guarantors of the $1.2-billion term loan. The petition has also been supported by Glas Trust Company — the administrative agent of the term loans. Byju’s did not immediately comment on the development.

The lenders said that they are willing to infuse the necessary capital into Epic, Tynker and Osmo to reorganise the businesses. Once valued at $22 billion, Byju’s spent nearly $820 million in all to acquire these businesses through 2019-21 to expand its US footprint. Of the three entities, Epic — the most expensive acquisition at $500 million — was also put on the block by the cash-strapped company to repay the term loan to lenders.

Even though Byju’s defaulted on term loan obligations, the lenders said they tried to help the firm work through the situation. However, the company’s management has no intention or the ability to honour its obligations under the term loan.","Some of Byju's term loan lenders have filed petitions in a US Court.

No HC relief for co over delayed I-T return,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/no-hc-relief-for-co-over-delayed-i-t-return/articleshow/110752178.cms,"MUMBAI: The Delhi high court dismissed a writ petition filed by a technology company, seeking condonation of delay in filing its income-tax return for FY20. The Central Board of Direct Taxes had refused to invoke its powers accorded to it under section 119 of the I-T Act to condone this delay — the HC found no justification to interfere with this view.This order is being widely discussed among tax circles, including I-T officials. A major fallout of not filing a timely return is that carry-forward of losses, which is typi cally available over the subsequent eight-year period is denied, as are several tax benefits. A govt official said, this order will mitigate instances of taxpayers adopting a lax attitude in complying with statutory provisions.Sunil Agarwal, senior standing counsel for the I-T department and one of the advocates representing the matter, said, “Genuine hardship is the cornerstone for exercise of this discretion by the CBDT . The taxpayer’s contentions such as the delay arose owing to the fall-out of Covid, that the delay was a one-time aberration or even of financial crisis were proved to be factually incorrect and found non-sustainable by the high court.”Several taxpayers, who were impacted by the fall out of the pandemic, had found it difficult to file their I-T returns and pay their dues. For FY20, the CBDT had extended the timeline for filing the I-T returns to Feb 15, 2021 (for large taxpayers who are obligated to carry out a tax audit) and to Jan 10, 2021, for others. Yet, some taxpayers continued to seek condonation for delays in filing of the I-T return beyond the extended due date.The HC observed that authorities had taken various facts into consideration when the prayer for condonation was made by Lava International. The company had up to Feb 15, 2021, to file its I-T return, yet although its financials were signed on July 31, 2020, the I-T return was filed by it only on March 30, 2021. This reflected negligence. Second, it was noted that the company had filed belated I-T returns in several instances, the delay for the financial ye ar 2019-20 was not an aberration. In response to a showcause notice the company attributed the delay to a financial and cash crunch. However, the financial statements for the relevant period showed a profit of Rs 24.8 crore and a cash flow of Rs 12.3 crore, which did not reflect any financial hardship.The HC noted that the “power of condonation under section 119(2) can be exercised to deal with extraordinary circumstances only, which would have led to delay in statutory compliance. The same cannot be exercised routinely”.","The Delhi high court dismissed a writ petition filed by a technology company, seeking condonation of delay in filing its income-tax return for FY20. The Central Board of Direct Taxes had refused to invoke its powers under section 119 of the I-T Act to condone this delay.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110752188,imgsize-439943,width-400,resizemode-4/110752188.jpg"

The finance minister set the stage for a ""Viksit Bharat by 2047"", on the core principles of ‘Sabka Saath’, ‘Sabka Vikas’, ‘Sabka Vishwas’, with ‘Sabka Prayas’ being added as a new theme in the interim Budget.This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data i.e., farmer welfare and N for Nari utthan i.e., support for women entrepreneurs. These form the pillars of a comprehensive inclusive development. The Government's commitment to sustainable development under the strategy for Amrit Kaal includes achieving 'Net Zero' by 2070, rooftop solarization for one crore households and robust health initiatives.The Indian economy's resilience takes center stage amidst positive indicators of declining current account deficit as a percentage of GDP, falling unemployment rates, and a notable rise in digital transactions. These statistics affirm the robustness of the economy, showcasing a trajectory of growth and stability.The achievements in taxation reforms are nothing short of remarkable, with direct tax collections more than trebling in the last decade, the number of tax return filers increasing by 2.4 times, average processing time of tax returns plummeting from 93 days in FY 2013-14 to an impressive 10 days in FY 2023-24, resulting in issuance of quick refunds. These are the results of consistent progressive measures thus obviating the need for, and rightly avoiding, any last-minute populist measures.No change in existing tax rates, both for direct and indirect taxes, is a good indicator of stability and predictability for investors and taxpayers.A welcome move to waive outstanding tax demands that are minor, disputed, and unreconciled. This involves the withdrawal of outstanding direct tax demands up to Rs. 25,000 pertaining to the period up to FY 2009-10 and up to Rs.10,000 for FY 2010-11 to 2014-15.The Government's commitment to fostering a business-friendly environment is evident in its intent to extend specific tax benefits for start-ups, investments by sovereign wealth funds/ pension funds, and certain IFSC units. The extension has been made now until March 31, 2025. This might help in creating a conducive landscape for business.To align with the CBDT notification issued earlier, the provisions relating to tax collection at source concerning remittances under the Liberalized Remittance Scheme have now been formally incorporated in the Finance Bill, 2024, setting the rate at 20% for amounts exceeding Rs. 7 lakhs in a financial year.The Finance Bill, 2024 proposes an extension of the time limit for introducing the faceless scheme by the Central Government for transfer pricing proceedings, DRP Proceedings, and ITAT Proceedings, up to March 31, 2025.The interim Budget 2024 may not have proposed significant tax announcements, but it very well positioned the prelude to the full budget post the upcoming elections. Considering the potential impact on the population across the four pillars of GYAN, a sizable portion of India stands to be covered. The interim Budget’s focus on the tax front resembles a report card, highlighting the maturity achieved by our tax system. The enhancement of taxpayer services was emphasized as a key priority.","This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data and N for Nari utthan.

Interim Budget for a Viksit Bharat: It’s for everyone and all,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/interim-budget-for-a-viksit-bharat-its-for-everyone-and-all/articleshow/107497439.cms,"By Akhilesh Tuteja

The Finance Minister on February 01, 2024, delivered a truly innovative interim budget. At first glance, it did not seem like an interim budget but looked more like the budget to drive further growth and a continuum of inclusive growth-oriented investments.At the outset, this budget brings a wonderful balance between fiscal prudence and continued investment for growth. It's not easy to continue the glide path of reducing the fiscal deficit and continuing to make significant investments in all areas including infrastructure, R&D, energy transition, technology, skilling, and social welfare. The surprising reduction in fiscal deficit of 5.8% as against the budgeted 5.9% for FY24 and the projection of 5.1% in FY25 with a clear focus on increasing investments was a huge positive.This was a budget for everyone and all because it caters to every part of the Indian economy and society. The FM has carefully catered to the investment needs of various sectors. The continued focus on youth, impoverished, women and farmers to increase their involvement and contribution to economic growth is evident. By committing an 11.1% increase in capital expenditure to 11,11,111 lakh crore, the FM has clearly brought every single 1 in this growth journey.What was very impressive was the inclusion strategy of the government. The focus on women's empowerment for the past few years is unprecedented, which is reflected in the inclusion of women in the workforce moving from 23.3% to 37% in the last five years. The thirty crore Mudra Yojna loans to women entrepreneurs were a great boost to the Nari Shakti initiative. We already have over 10 million Lakhpati Didis and what is truly evident is like a corporate CFO, the FM has revised the earlier target of 20 million Lakhpati Didis to 30 million. The government also plans to invest in initiatives to encourage young girls between the ages of 9 and 14 to undertake the vaccination for cervical cancer which is again a great boost to Nari Shakti.A lot needs to be done to bring more women into all parts of economic growth but the journey so far and the vision of the future is truly inspiring.While India continues on its technological prowess and makes its mark in new technologies like Artificial Intelligence, we need a multi-pronged strategy to harness the power of AI. We need a clear focus on building AI systems in India so that we not only emerge as a global leader in this new era but can build models, which are specific to India that will benefit Indians. At the same time, we need a very wide coverage program to build skills to leverage AI to its fullest potential. The biggest contribution we can make to the inclusion of youth in the economic development of the country is by skilling them in new skill areas. In the last few years, the Skill India Mission has trained 14 million youth, reskilled over 5 million youth and established a staggering 3,000 new ITIs. The future of any country will depend as much on capital investments as on skill investments.The focus on agricultural development and support to the farmer continues through direct financial assistance to farmers. The farmers have benefited by getting crop insurance through PM Fasal Bima Yojana. It's not just the farmers, the PM-SVANidhi provides credit assistance to a large number of street vendors.The last few years have seen the journey of affordable housing through Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY). There is a slight increase in allocation to launch a scheme for encouraging the middle class to build or buy new homes. This investment will likely propel a wider economic development and increase employment.India has seen a tremendous rise in entrepreneurship in the last few years. In order to continue the journey and promote new startups, the government proposes to extend certain tax benefits, which are expiring from March 2024 to March 2025. The MSMEs have not been left behind. With a proposal to provide timely finances to such enterprises, the government has paved the way for their growth, so they can look to compete globally.All in all, it’s a truly inclusive budget with a clear focus on development not just by giving away freebies but enabling the people to participate in the economic development activity. While the FM calls the comprehensive GDP - Governance, Development & Performance – to me, this budget is inclusive of another GDP – gender, demography, and professions.","Akhilesh Tuteja is Partner and Head, Clients and Markets, KPMG in India.

‘Enough domestic sources of demand to counter drag from external sector’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/enough-domestic-sources-of-demand-to-counter-drag-from-external-sector/articleshow/107372012.cms,"Do you think the

creates room for lower interest rates?

One of the issues that the Budget has flagged is the demographic challenge and opportunity and the societal change that is taking place. How do you view this?

Niti Aayog is working on the Viksit Bharat roadmap. What will be the focus areas?

You are as much a representative of the Centre as well as the states. Is it time to revisit the entire formula for transfers to states particularly on the issue of cesses and surcharges?

Suman Bery , who heads Niti Aayog , the govt think tank, is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China, which he says is also an opportunity for India. The economist is confident that Indian states remain resilient. Excerpts of the interview with TOI.The finance ministry expects the economy to grow 7% next year. Given the global situation, how do you see the prospects?The belief in the finance ministry is that we have a possible drag coming from the external sector but that we have other sources. We have enough domestic sources of demand. One has to applaud the political and economic judgment of FM in deciding that it was appropriate to pursue the path of fiscal consolidation. There is transparency. What this actually reflects is responsible economic management, which is one reason we are where we are. Second, it also creates a buffer so that there is policy space if we do encounter headwinds.That’s the hope and expectation. We have an independent central bank and an inflation targeting central bank, so it is up to the monetary policy committee to take a call through the monetary policy committee on the repo rate .The PM has said that when India grows its states grow. India is a composite of 37 states and UTs. They are each at very different points in their demographic transition. There are some states where the net replacement rate is down to 1%, like Kerala . There are others, particularly UP and Bihar, which are in their earliest stage of demographic transition and each one of these states is the size of a large European country. There are two implications of that — one is internal labour mobility and it will become an even larger part of our growth model. The govt has taken several steps to create a unified market. Our main endowment is our human capital and that has to be equipped to participate in global exchange in many ways. We know from China, Japan that the demographic dividend partly depends on markets and on human capital. But the golden period is fairly short lived, about 15 years, when the so called dependency ratio declines. The other big opportunity the PM has been highlighting is bringing women much more into the active labour force.When Niti was set up there was the idea of a three-year vision and a seven-year strategy paper. The reality is that schemes of govt tend to be aligned with the award of the Finance Commission . There are various established building blocks or hand holds which are already a matter of govt policy. The PM is much more interested in a national debate on what it means to be a Viksit Bharat or modern society. We have a collective goal and it is for the democratic polity to define what that goal should be. Its emphatically not for a super mandarin bureaucracy. It is not going to be Lee Kwan Yew’s Singapore led from the top.It’s entirely a finance ministry matter but I would be lying if I didn’t say when I visit certain states there is this complaint. A big frontier would be resource mobilisation at the state level. Second is going to be rationalisation of subsidies not only at the Union level, but also at the state level. All chief ministers sit on my governing council. When they convene as the governing council, I see them in their role as development practitioners. The world is beginning to appreciate quite how much institutional and political maturity India attained in our 75 years and the most fundamental dimension of a democracy, we have orderly transfers of power. There are enough buffers to ensure that what happens in state finances is unlikely to create macro instability. Those risks are well contained by our Constitution. The chief ministers know that they are going to be judged by development outcomes and so you can have the sugar rush of changing of pension plans or various handouts but if the cupboard is bare you are not going to be able to deliver.","Suman Bery is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China.

Government's Marathon to 2047: Emphasis on Fiscal Prudence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/governments-marathon-to-2047-emphasis-on-fiscal-prudence/articleshow/107371788.cms,"What was the thinking behind keeping the vote on account absolutely straight?

So is it the idea to keep the Budget completely transparent?

The capex has risen 11.1% and there is an emphasis on infrastructure spending. But there is also the hope that the private sector will now take over and start capital spending. Given the geopolitical situation, how confident is the govt that it will pan out as planned?

Finance secretary T V Somanathan, in an interview with TOI, says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047 . Excerpts:If you see the Budget speech you will see the emphasis on 2047. The govt has set its sight on running that marathon. Running to 2047 is a marathon , it’s not a sprint. If you are going to run a marathon, you need to be in good shape and you can’t have short-term stimulants or something that will get you some yards and then it’s done.The whole focus is on making India a developed country by 2047, for which a healthy present and a strong fiscal position is an important concomitant. Some purely short term measures don’t really fit into that picture. It’s a consistent picture: focus on the long term for which you need to build strength in the short term and that needs to be done by prudence in fiscal policy and by not doing things which can detract you from that path. Not doing the wrong thing is more important than appearing to do things.The idea is that govt finances may be good, bad or indifferent depending on the times, depending on the circumstances, depending on the policies. But what is the position should be reflected as reasonably and accurately as possible. That is an emphasis. As regards the Finance Commission, again the terms of reference that have been given to them are the terms in the Constitution.What is the means by which the devolution should be done is a matter they have full discretion. They can actually take all kinds of factors into account and in a sense we felt this time based on my review of the previous commissions that the right expression would be less is more. The shorter, less prescriptive terms of reference gives full scope for all stakeholders including state govts to express their viewpoints and for the commission to take a balanced view of the different perspectives and then come to its award. Ultimately the award of the Finance Commission is about devolution and grant for which full scope has now been given to them.n There are incipient signs of private capital expenditure accelerating. There are some surveys I have seen done by some of the chambers industry, which show high levels of investment. The PMI, which is a sort of leading indicator, is also looking pretty healthy. Capacity utilisation is one reason that private sector capital expenditure doesn’t immediately pick up when the economy starts accelerating because there is surplus capacity.But increasingly I get the sense that many industries are beginning to reach levels where they have to add capacity. When that happens capital investment will happen. Another pointer also mentioned in the Budget speech you may notice that our airlines have placed large orders for planes — that is capital expenditure.When you import 1,000 aircraft, it’s just not 1,000 aircraft, there are concomitant additions to ground handling facilities, you need airports to expand, you need to employ people to do that. That means a lot of jobs. The aircraft is capital but then look at the effect it is going to have on skilled jobs. So capital expenditure is happening. I am fairly confident that we will have decent capital expenditure in the year to come and that will become a new source of acceleration.",Finance secretary T V Somanathan says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047. The capex has risen 11.1% and there is an emphasis on infrastructure spending.

Income Tax Changes Budget 2024 : In the recent Budget 2024 speech, the Finance Minister kept the Section 80C tax deduction limit unchanged. The maximum limit for claiming tax benefits under Section 80C remains at Rs 1.5 lakh for the current fiscal year 2023-24 and will stay the same for individuals looking to save on taxes through Section 80C investments in the upcoming fiscal year 2024-25.Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions. Individuals can reduce their gross taxable income by up to Rs 1.5 lakh per financial year by engaging in these specific investments or expenditures.You can save on taxes through Section 80C by investing in things like Employees' Provident Fund (EPF), Public Provident Fund (PPF), Equity Linked Saving Scheme (ELSS) mutual funds, National Savings Certificate (NSC), and 5-year tax-saving fixed deposits with banks or post offices. Additionally, paying life insurance policy premiums also qualifies for tax benefits under Section 80C.It is important to note that each eligible investment comes with its specific maximum limit, rate of return, liquidity, and taxation rules for the earned returns, states ET in a report. For instance, the most you can invest in PPF in a financial year is Rs 1.5 lakh. Meanwhile, there's no limit on the amount you can invest in ELSS mutual funds, but the Section 80C deduction is capped at Rs 1.5 lakh.If individuals can't make specific investments, they can still get deductions under Section 80C from their gross taxable income through certain expenses. These expenses include repaying the principal amount of a home loan, tuition fees for children, payment of stamp duty, registration fees, and other costs related to buying a house.Since the financial year 2020-21, individuals without any business income must annually choose between the old and new tax regimes. As of the fiscal year 2023-24, the new tax regime is the default option. Consequently, individuals seeking tax deductions under Section 80C must opt for the old tax regime since this deduction isn't available in the new tax regime. It's crucial for taxpayers to be aware of these rules to make informed decisions about their tax planning and investment strategies.","Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget which is an interim budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year. The budget talks about inclusive development both, social and geographical, especially for youth, women, farmers, and the poor. Continued focus on improving logistics through infrastructure spend on roads, rail, airports, ports increases productivity for companies and citizens alike.To make ‘Viksit Bharat’ by 2047, the government’s focus is on improving and empowering people’s capabilities through various skilling initiatives. It is encouraging to see that Skill India Mission has succeeded in training more than 1.4 crore youth and upskilling and reskilling 54 lakh youth. I am particularly happy to see the continued focus on youth and women entrepreneurship and the announcement of a new fund which will give interest free 50 year loans for startups will provide a domestic fillip to startups supplementing venture capital we have traditionally relied on from abroad.PM Mudra Yojana has sanctioned 43 crore loans aggregating to 22.5 lakh crore to youth entrepreneurs and thirty crore Mudra Yojana loans to women entrepreneurs. There are several other schemes like Fund of Funds, Start-Up India, and Start-Up Credit Guarantee schemes that are assisting our youth. Further, the extension of tax benefits to Start-ups and investments made by sovereign wealth funds/pension funds, till 31st March 2025 depicts the government’s effort to support the startup eco- system.This aligns quite well with India Sanitation Coalition’s efforts to give impetus to the start-up world. Over the past 7 editions of our ISC-FICCI Sanitation Awards, we have recognized and promoted several start-ups in the sanitation space, many of whom are successful businesses now!While the finance minister did not provide detailed information on Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH), the budget allocation sees a slight increase in spend demonstrating continued focus on this highly successful program. The acknowledgement that the private sector has increasingly played a substantial role in addressing WASH issues in both urban and rural areas, with numerous projects underway through Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs), highlights the government's commitment to addressing challenges in this sector.A perfect example is the LightHouse Initiative initiated by the Department of Drinking Water along with the India Sanitation Coalition (ISC) by partnering with major corporates across India to develop model villages in Solid and Liquid Waste Management (SLWM) under SBM-Grameen. From this budget, there is an expectation that the government will persist in prioritizing Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) as the path toward achieving the country's Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6). Additionally, it is hoped that the government will uphold its commitment to making necessary infrastructural investments for SLWM.The budget speech rightly celebrates the fact that we have 83 lakh SHGs and 9 crore women beneficiaries. The microfinance movement in the country and the possibility of empowering women members of SHGs through livelihood skilling is a key to bringing women into mainstream economic advancement.The focus on green growth, rooftop solar, wind, biomass, e-vehicles all help with our green energy thrust. The tourism sector was mentioned and could be a huge job provider for youth and women.Guided by the principle ‘Reform, Perform, and Transform’, the budget emphasizes efficient implementation of various policies by improving coordination with states and relevant stakeholders. This is critical both for infra spend and social programsIt is noteworthy that ISC’s Climate Resilient Coastal Cities project which is being implemented in PPP (Public-Private Partnership) mode in four coastal states of Karnataka, Gujarat, Goa and Maharashtra is congruent with the government’s priority of promoting climate-resilient activities for the blue economy 2.0, a scheme for restoration and adaptation measures, and coastal aquaculture.The budget also focuses on the Aspirational districts program where assistance will be given to the states for faster development of aspirational districts and blocks, including the generation of ample economic opportunities. This is again very crucial as it has a huge potential to transform the landscape of our country while making sure no -one is left behind.Overall, this budget has embraced economic strategies and develops the building blocks that nurture and uphold growth, promote inclusive and sustainable development, and enhance productivity.","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year.

At the top end of the price band, Novelis would have a market value of $12.6 billion.“The decision to delay the IPO is a bit disturbing given that Hindalco’s management is usually very thoughtful,” Kunal Kothari, analyst at Centrum Broking, was quoted as saying to Bloomberg. “There could be a view at Hindalco that they think internal accruals could be enough for financing future projects and they don’t need external sources of funds.”According to Reuters, analysts at AJ Bell had pointed towards the unpredictability of commodity prices which could make Novelis “hard to sell”. The US stock market has been on a roll the last few weeks with all three leading indices — Dow Jones, S&P500 and the Nasdaq Composite — at near their alltime high levels.However, there is some nervousness about the high interest rates in the US and for over a year now, investors globally have been speculating when the US Fed could cut interest rates.","Hindalco had planned to sell 45 million shares or 7.5% of Novelis for $18 to $21 each.

For a decade, they have only dealt with a govt at the Centre that enjoyed absolute majority, with decision-making streamlined.Tuesday's election verdict has not only made them sit up and take note of the changes that may come about when the new cabinet is sworn in, but even traditional businesses that thrived during the post-reforms coalition era, are now discussing adjustments.Most business leaders and the quote-happy industry chambers have gone silent, refusing to comment or even present their wish list for the new govt, as they watch political developments unfold in the Capital. There is discussion around how PM Narendra Modi in his record-equalling third term may have a slightly different work style from the first two.""There has to be some adjustment for the new-age businesses. It will depend on which ministries the allies get,"" said an industry veteran. Over the years, some familiarity with some of the ministers has also crept in.While businesses may not be entirely happy with how govt reacted to some of their comments in public, they have no complaints about how their issues were addressed. ""If it is an industry issue, we have always received a patient hearing, even with ministers present in those meetings. And, if a solution could not be found we were asked to write the details and suggestions, and there was an attempt to address them,"" a large investor in India said.Even traditional businesses have found ways to raise their issues, meeting ministers directly or flagging it to PMO.Unlike the earlier regimes, where middlemen could often be seen in ministry corridors, CEOs of large companies have been able to directly approach ministries in the last 10 years.Analysing the mandate, an executive with an overseas entity working in India, said investors are watching how the favourable macro-economic situation is converted into micro-focused strategy that deals with challenges related to jobs or addresses price rise issues. ""There may not be big directional changes but there now needs to be greater consensus on reforms,"" the executive said.So, labour reforms, which will not just benefit factories but also gig workers, are areas where there are some concerns, given that several states were not backing the rules under the Labour Codes and opposition may grow.""The overall opportunity in India remains intact, given the fast growth and large market.

The sensex moved from marginal negative mark in early trades to up over 1,500 points by mid-session. And after allies in NDA confirmed their participation in the BJP-led govt, the index finally settled 2,303 points up at 74,382 points.

Tesla shareholder sues Musk for alleged $7.5 billion insider trading,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/tesla-shareholder-sues-musk-for-alleged-7-5-billion-insider-trading/articleshow/110608901.cms,"NEW DELHI: A Tesla shareholder, on Thursday, sued Elon Musk engaged in insider trading by selling over $7.5 billion worth of shares in the electric car manufacturer in late 2022.Shareholder Michael Perry filed the lawsuit in Delaware Chancery Court, contending that Musk sold the shares before the public disclosure of potentially disappointing production and delivery figures, resulting in an estimated $3 billion in insider profits for Musk. Tesla's share price plummeted after the company's fourth-quarter numbers were made public on January 2, 2023.""Musk exploited his position at Tesla, and he breached his fiduciary duties to Tesla,"" the lawsuit said, asking the court to direct Musk to return the profits made from the trades.According to the lawsuit, Musk sold the shares on multiple occasions between November and December 2022. The complaint also accuses Tesla's directors of failing in their fiduciary duty by permitting Musk to execute the sales.As of the report, neither Musk nor Tesla had responded to requests for comment from Reuters.Perry alleges that Musk, who had previously touted strong demand for Tesla vehicles in 2022, became aware of lower-than-anticipated figures in mid-November, utilizing his access to real-time data to sell his shares before the information became public. Following the revelation of vehicle price discounts and the subsequent release of figures in January, Tesla's stock experienced a significant decline.""Had (Musk) waited to make these sales until after the release of material adverse news,... his sales would have netted him less than 55% of the amounts realized from his November and December 2022 sales,"" the lawsuit said.This legal action adds to Musk's ongoing legal challenges. Notably, Tesla shareholders are set to vote on June 13 regarding the ratification of Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge nullified in January due to improper control exerted by Musk.Additionally, Musk is under regulatory scrutiny for potential violations of federal securities laws related to his acquisition of shares in Twitter, later rebranded as X. Musk has criticized the US securities and exchange commission, accusing them of harassment through unwarranted investigations.Musk and the top US markets regulator have been in a years-long feud, dating back to 2018 when he tweeted that he had ""funding secured"" to take Tesla private.A separate shareholder lawsuit has accused Musk of defrauding X investors by delaying disclosing his stake in the social media company to amass lower-priced shares.(With inputs from the agency)","A Tesla shareholder, on Thursday, sued Elon Musk engaged in insider trading by selling over $7.5 billion worth of shares in the electric car manufacturer in late 2022.

New meme coin with 100x potential prepares for launch,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/new-meme-coin-with-100x-potential-prepares-for-launch-last-chance-to-invest-in-dogeverse-presale/articleshow/110597550.cms,"Dogeverse lives on 6 chains, creating unique opportunity for cross-chain applications

Dogeverse Is poised to soar to top of Meme Coin charts

Analysts line up behind Dogeverse, predict massive gains

Staking rewards limit selling pressure around launch, ensuring explosive price action

Dogeverse , a multi-chain meme coin built on 6 of the most popular blockchain networks, is readying for launch after one of the most successful presales of 2024. The project raised more than $15 million, putting it among the top 70 meme coins in the world by market cap.Investors and traders now have just 3 days remaining to buy $DOGEVERSE before it hits exchanges. The presale will officially end on Monday, June 3, at 10am UTC. However, it could close even sooner if Dogeverse sells out the remaining tokens in its $17 million hard cap.The presale will be followed by a token claim two days later, on Wednesday, June 5, at 10am UTC. $DOGEVERSE will simultaneously list on decentralized exchanges on Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, Polygon, Binance Smart Chain, and Base immediately following the token claim.Analysts expect that $DOGEVERSE will explode higher after trading begins. So, this is the final chance to join Dogeverse before the token shoots for the moon and potentially delivers enormous gains for everyone who bought tokens during the presale. Dogeverse is something that the meme coin world has never seen before: a token that lives not just on Ethereum or Solana, but on six of the most popular blockchains.Dogeverse is native to Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, Polygon, Binance Smart Chain, and Base. Investors can buy the token on any of these networks, and it will list for trading on exchanges on all of them at the same time.That means the scale of Dogeverse’s launch will be unprecedented. The token will be instantly available to holders of all ERC-20 tokens, all BSC-20 tokens, $AVAX, $SOL, Solana meme coins, and Base meme coins.The potential audience of traders buying $DOGEVERSE and pushing up its price immediately after launch is enormous. Ethereum remains the largest and most popular blockchain network for altcoins, but Solana, Base, and Avalanche are quickly growing in importance. By launching on all of these networks, Dogeverse ensures that it will benefit from growth in any of these chains instead of potentially being stuck on a network that goes out of favor.Dogeverse also has inherent value because of what the project team calls multi-bridge utility. Dogeverse can transfer assets between major blockchains with no wrapped tokens and low gas fees.It’s an elegant solution to one of the biggest problems in Web3—how to get blockchains to work together. Dogeverse opens the door to cross-chain applications in DeFi, crypto gaming, crypto trading, metaverse development, and more. It could ultimately serve as the foundation of a more connected and accessible blockchain ecosystem.The Dogeverse presale raised $15 million, an amount that has caught many meme coin traders’ attention. This is already one of the largest meme coin ICOs of all time and puts $DOGEVERSE in the top 70 meme coins by market cap.Dogeverse could quickly move up through the charts. A recently launched dog-themed meme coin, Dog-go-to-the-Moon ($DOG), rocketed from a $10 million market cap to a $825 million market cap within just two weeks of launching. $DOG has no utility and no staking, and began with a much smaller community around it compared to $DOGEVERSE.So, Dogeverse could not only replicate Dog-go-to-the-Moon’s trajectory, but exceed it. A $1 billion market cap could potentially be in reach, putting $DOGEVERSE ahead of hugely successful Solana meme coins like Book of Meme.It also helps that 7 out of 10 meme coins in the top 10 are dog-themed. Dogeverse builds on the legacy of the ultra-successful doge meme with its chain-hopping, space-faring mascot, Cosmo.Crypto analysts have also been extremely bullish on Dogeverse, a strong signal that the token is poised for gains. One analyst, Jacob ‘Crypto’ Bury, predicted that Dogeverse could soar as much as 100x after launch.https://www.youtube.com/embed/XDT7PBzdjwAOther analysts have been more conservative, but still extremely bullish. YouTube influencer ClayBro predicted a 20x gain for $DOGEVERSE, while Myles G Investments predicted a 10x gain. Together, these three analysts boast a combined following of more than 230,000 subscribers.Dogeverse has also gotten a lot of positive coverage in crypto media. Decrypt, Bitcoin.com, The Economic Times, Crypto.news, CryptoPotato, NewsBTC, and Cryptonews.com have all covered Dogeverse’s presale. The crypto community clearly expects this launch to make a big splash.$DOGEVERSE investors who buy during the final days of the presale have the option to stake their tokens to earn 44% APY rewards. This is an opportunity to earn even more $DOGEVERSE before the token’s price begins climbing.Importantly, staking can also limit selling pressure in the immediate aftermath of the token launch. Staking rewards vest 7 days after trading beings, meaning traders who sell immediately will forfeit their reward tokens. Staking rewards will be distributed over a two-year period.https://twitter.com/The_DogeVerse/status/1795817514481443278?ref_src=twsrc%5EtfwWithout selling from presale investors, it’s likely that demand will far outstrip available supply in the days after Dogeverse’s launch. That translates to explosive upward price action similar to the kind that have produced 10x or greater gains for other meme coins in the past.The next three days are the final opportunity investors have to buy $DOGEVERSE before the token launches. Don’t miss this chance to get the next meme coin to explode before the rocket takes off.Disclaimer: The above content is non-editorial, and TIL hereby disclaims any and all warranties, expressed or implied, relating to the same.

China’s 60 million homes are hard to sell even in big cities,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/chinas-60-million-homes-are-hard-to-sell-even-in-big-cities/articleshow/110580493.cms,"Top Cities

Developer Relief

Chinese policymakers have identified reducing a glut of housing inventory as the key to ending the nation’s unprecedented property slump . It’s easy to see why.The country has the equivalent of 60 million unsold apartments, which will take more than four years to sell without government aid , according to Bloomberg Economics. The oversupply is dragging down prices at the fastest rate in a decade, giving people less reason to buy a home. The situation is worst in the capital city.To break this vicious cycle, the central bank recently announced a 300 billion yuan ($41 billion) initiative for local governments to purchase unsold homes . On the demand side, it urged cities to reduce minimum downpayments and mortgage rates to entice buyers. But it remains to be seen whether the steps will succeed in shrinking supply and ending the crisis.“Housing inventory is at its highest in China’s history,” said Jay Lau, a property analyst at S&P Global Ratings. “The latest property policies could be a temporary confidence booster.”Below are charts that show the scale of China’s problem with unsold housing.Even in China’s four tier-1 cities, where the market is relatively resilient, it will take an estimated 27 months to sell the supply of new homes as of April, according to China Real Estate Information Corp. That is the longest in at least seven years. By comparison, the US has about nine months’ supply of new homes, according to the US housing department.Three of China’s biggest cities — Shanghai, Shenzhen and Guangzhou — have rolled out major easing for homebuyers, slashing downpayment requirements and allowing room for cheaper home loans. Analysts expect Beijing, the other tier-1 city, to do the same. China’s capital has the longest monthly overhang in unsold homes, according to CRIC.There’s no guarantee that the loosening will revive home sales immediately. Homeowners even in big metropolitan areas are losing conviction in their decades-long belief that property is a reliable store of wealth, according to Yan Yuejin, director of E-house China Research & Development Institute.“There is a fundamental change in homebuyers’ confidence over the biggest cities in the long term,” Yan said. “While low-tier cities have higher outstanding housing stock, the major inventory issue lies in bigger ones.”As of April, about 80% of China’s cities had an inventory absorption pace that was worse than a “warning line” of 18 months, according to CRIC. That’s even after developers refrained from offering new projects amid lackluster sales, leading new supply to shrink 20% from March.The challenge looks just as daunting when measured by floor space. Residences completed by developers but unsold expanded to 391 million square meters nationwide as of April, the highest since 2017, official data show. Including properties that are almost finished and approved for presale, the stock is much larger at about 1.8 billion square meters, JPMorgan Chase & Co. estimates. Most of the excess sits in lower-tier cities, according to S&P.China’s support package announced on May 17 is estimated to translate into 500 billion yuan of credit to help government-backed firms buy housing stock from developers. Yet that is unlikely to make a big enough dent in the supply, according to economists.Reducing the inventory to a more optimal level through government-backed acquisitions would require 5 trillion yuan, according to JPMorgan analyst Karl Chan. CGS International Securities HK’s Raymond Cheng estimates 1 trillion yuan to 2 trillion yuan of funding is needed.There are also questions over the program’s implementation as smaller trials earlier have struggled to get traction amid questions over the incentives for local governments, developers and banks.Not all of China’s developers will be able to tap the property-purchase plan to swap inventory for much-needed cash. Many have pledged a large part of their real estate held for sale to secure loans, making it tough for them to divest the assets, said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Kristy Hung. KWG Group Holdings Ltd., for example, pledged 92% of its properties held for sale as of the end of last year, according to BI.The rescue fund might have more meaningful impact in injecting liquidity for China Vanke Co. and Longfor Group Holdings Ltd., whose unpledged properties held for sale exceeded their short-term debt as of last year, BI estimates. They now have the option to offload slow-selling inventory to local government-backed firms at a discount to beef up cash.","China has the equivalent of 60 million unsold apartments, which will take more than four years to sell without government aid.

US GDP growth was slower last quarter on soft consumer spending,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-gdp-growth-was-slower-last-quarter-on-soft-consumer-spending/articleshow/110569714.cms,"Metric Revision Initial Estimate GDP +1.3% +1.6%

Consumer spending +2.0% +2.5%

Nonresidential investment +3.3% +2.9% Residential investment +15.4% +13.9% Government spending +1.3% +1.2%

The US economy grew at a slower pace in the first quarter than initially reported, primarily reflecting softer consumer spending on goods.Gross domestic product rose 1.3% annualized in the first three months of the year, below the previous estimate of 1.6%, Bureau of Economic Analysis figures published Thursday showed. The economy’s main growth engine — personal spending — advanced 2.0%, versus the previous estimate of 2.5%.The numbers underscore a loss of momentum to start 2024 after continual upside surprises in 2023. High interest rates, waning pandemic-era savings and slower income growth are some of the key factors weighing on American households and businesses.Consumer spending was marked down as outlays for goods — particularly autos — were much softer. Federal government spending slowed, while imports picked up compared to the first estimate. Net exports subtracted from growth for the first time in two years.The downward revision to consumer spending was partially offset by stronger business and residential investment. A key measure of underlying domestic demand known as final sales to private domestic purchasers rose 2.8%, versus the initially reported 3.1% increase.Economists have pointed to the strength in this metric as reason to believe that demand is still strong, even if the headline GDP figure looks weak by comparison.“Monthly data beyond March generally point to a continued, albeit gently cooling, economic expansion . We anticipate continued GDP gains this year and a healthy advance in 2024 overall,” Nationwide Financial Markets Economist Oren Klachkin said in a note.“Some warning signs regarding the economic outlook are visible beneath the surface, but nothing that makes us pessimistic about the road ahead.”Alongside its second estimate of GDP, the BEA also publishes data on gross domestic income, its other main measure of economic activity. GDI rose 1.5% in the first quarter, according to the report. GDP measures spending on goods and services, whereas GDI measures income generated and costs incurred from producing those same goods and services.The GDI data include figures on corporate profits. In the first quarter, adjusted pre-tax profits fell 0.6%, the first decline in a year. After-tax profits as a share of gross value added for non-financial corporations, a measure of aggregate profit margins, were little changed at 15.2%.On the inflation front, the Federal Reserve’s preferred metric — the personal consumption expenditures price index — rose at a 3.3% annualized rate in the first quarter, slightly down from the initial projection. Excluding food and energy, the core PCE gauge rose 3.6%, versus 3.7% in the previous estimate.Growth in disposable personal income was marked up to 1.9% versus 1.1% initially. That may bode well for consumer spending and GDP going forward.Economists are looking ahead to the release of monthly PCE data for April, due Friday from the BEA, after reports published earlier this month showed a stalling in growth of retail sales and a slower pace of increase in consumer prices to start the second quarter.Fresh merchandise trade figures for April suggest little room for improvement in the second quarter. Separate data out Thursday showed the gap in goods trade last month widened to the largest since May 2022.Meantime, initial applications for unemployment benefits were little changed in the latest week at low levels.",Gross domestic product rose 1.3% annualized in the first three months of the year.

Saudi Arabia set to launch $10 billion Aramco offer,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/saudi-arabia-set-to-launch-10-billion-aramco-offer/articleshow/110553504.cms,"Economic Transformation

Saudi IPO Boom

Saudi Arabia is preparing to formally launch a secondary offering of shares in oil giant Aramco as soon as Sunday, a deal that could raise more than $10 billion and rank among the largest of its kind in recent years.The government plans to run a book-building process to take orders until next Thursday, people familiar with the matter said, asking not to be identified as the information is private. The deal has attracted informal interest from investors across the Mideast and Europe totaling over $10 billion, they said.The offering will likely be priced at a further discount of as much as 10% to the trading price, though that could narrow based on investor demand, some of the people said. That’s in line with secondary sales in Saudi Telecom Co. and Tadawul Group Holding, which operates the kingdom’s stock exchange.No final decisions have been made on the offering period. Terms of the deal, including its size, could still change, the people said. Aramco didn’t immediately respond to requests to comment.The offering is set to come days after Aramco’s stock dropped to the lowest level in over a year. The deal opening will coincide with an OPEC+ gathering on Sunday to discuss oil output policy, with most market-watchers expecting the group to maintain supply curbs. That would keep Saudi Arabia’s production near the lowest level in about three yearsThe kingdom is lining up a slate of banks including Citigroup Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and HSBC Holdings Plc for the deal, Bloomberg News has previously reported. Local firms including Saudi National Bank are likely to be involved, people familiar with the matter said, while Moelis & Co. has been acting as a financial adviser to help pick underwriters.The follow-on offer would come almost five years after Saudi Arabia raised about $30 billion in Aramco’s IPO, which was the world’s largest ever stock sale.Some of the Wall Street banks likely to be involved in the secondary offering also worked on that listing, when they were paid just over $100 million. In comparison, banks including Goldman and JPMorgan split about $60 million from helping Peloton Interactive Inc. raise $1.2 billion in 2019.Low fees are common in the Middle East. For bankers, the share sale is a trade-off between working for less and the prospect of winning more business in the largest Gulf economy that’s in the middle of a multitrillion-dollar overhaul.Proceeds from the share sale will help fund big initiatives tied to that economic transformation. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s plans include a push into artificial intelligence, sports, tourism as well as projects such as the $1.5 trillion development of Neom.The deal comes at a crucial time for the kingdom, which holds an 82% stake in the $1.9 trillion firm. Crude oil prices are below the levels the government needs to balance its budget and Saudi Arabia has lagged behind its target of attracting more than $100 billion a year in foreign direct investment.The government needs oil near $100 a barrel to pay for its spending plans, according to the International Monetary Fund. But global oil benchmark Brent, currently at about $85, is forecast to be near $79 in 2025 and $75 the following year, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg.Aramco’s oil production is also restricted by OPEC+ policy as the group’s de-facto leader Saudi Arabia tries to revive the market and boost prices. The company already has large unused output capacity, and earlier this year was ordered by the government to halt a further expansion of its capability.Against that backdrop, and amid questions about climate change and the future of fossil fuels, the offer will test global investors’ appetite. Aramco’s IPO had relied mostly on local investors, who’d faced pressure from the government to back the deal after most foreign money managers balked at valuations.While the company’s massive dividend payouts may now be a draw, its shares are expensive with price-to-earnings ratios almost 50% higher than Exxon Mobil Corp. and double Shell Plc’s.Any deal will also coincide with a resurgence in the Saudi market for new share sales — investors have plowed in a combined $176 billion in orders for four deals in recent weeks. That’s higher than the orders for Aramco’s 2019 IPO and is weighing on the kingdom’s stock market.The Tadawul All Share Index is trailing its emerging-market peers for the first time since the pandemic and has fallen almost 8% from its March peak — partly because of investors who’re holding on to cash to invest in the offerings.","Saudi Arabia is preparing to formally launch a secondary offering of shares in oil giant Aramco as soon as Sunday. The government plans to run a book-building process to take orders until next Thursday, people familiar with the matter said. The deal has attracted informal interest from investors across the Mideast and Europe totaling over $10 billion.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110553595,imgsize-377454,width-400,resizemode-4/110553595.jpg"
