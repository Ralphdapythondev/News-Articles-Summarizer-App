‘Vande Bharat Bullet Train’ soon? Indian Railways looks to roll out ‘Make in India’ bullet trains with 250 kmph speed this year,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/vande-bharat-bullet-train-soon-indian-railways-looks-to-roll-out-make-in-india-bullet-trains-with-250-kmph-speed-this-year/articleshow/110783813.cms,"Bullet train project

‘ Make in India ’ bullet trains on Vande Bharat platform! The Indian Railways has assigned the Integral Coach Factory ( ICF ) the task of domestically producing two standard-gauge bullet trains within the current fiscal year. This decision comes as negotiations with Japanese suppliers encountered obstacles due to pricing disagreements, according to officials.According to an ET report by Twesh Mishra, for the first time, India will manufacture a train capable of reaching a maximum speed of 250 kilometers per hour (kmph). These two trains are intended to operate on the Rs 1.08 lakh crore Mumbai-Ahmedabad High Speed Rail corridor.It is likely that the trains will be constructed using the Vande Bharat platform. Although utilizing an existing platform would assist ICF in reducing the time required to deliver the train sets, experts noted that supplying them within this fiscal year would be a challenging task.A senior official familiar with the development was quoted as saying, ""ICF, Chennai has been tasked to build and deliver two standard-gauge trainsets of eight cars, each featuring a steel car body, and a running speed of 220 kmph and a maximum speed of 250 kmph.""The official added that the order for the trains was placed earlier this week. Officials said that discussions with a consortium of Japanese rolling stock suppliers, Hitachi and Kawasaki, have been ongoing for an extended period but have made little progress.Also Check | New Vande Bharat sleeper coming soon! What's special about it? Check top features and photos of Indian Railways new train The cost of a 10-coach bullet train was estimated at Rs 389 crore in 2018, with each train expected to reach cruising speeds of over 300 kmph. In 2023, the estimated supply cost was revised to Rs 460 crore per train set. Despite the Japanese consortium's willingness to supply the 'Shinkansen' train sets, the Indian Railways remains unconvinced about the offered price.The bullet train project has experienced significant delays from its original completion deadline of 2022, primarily due to land acquisition challenges in Maharashtra. Experts believe that ICF will face an uphill battle to meet the timeline set by the Indian Railways for developing trains capable of running at 250 kmph.Sudhanshu Mani, a retired Indian Railways official credited with developing the first variant of the Vande Bharat trains, noted that the current top speed of Vande Bharat trains is only 180 kmph. He added, ""This bullet train development and supply target can be achieved by ICF over three to four years.”",Indian Railways has assigned the Integral Coach Factory ( ICF ) the task of domestically producing two standard-gauge bullet trains within the current fiscal year.

Godrej L’Affaire: Leading events and experiences with a commitment to environmental stewardship,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/godrej-laffaire-leading-events-and-experiences-with-a-commitment-to-environmental-stewardship/articleshow/110763814.cms,"Disclaimer: This article has been produced on behalf of Godrej by Times Internet’s Spotlight team.

In a world rife with corporate slogans about making a difference, it's easy to become cynical. Not everyone believes that businesses can be a force for good and green behaviour. Yet, in this era of skepticism, there are organisations committed to goodness, not just as slogans but as a philosophy that permeates every aspect of their operations, from product development to community engagement.Godrej Industries, with its unique approach, strives to integrate the philosophy of Good and Green into everything they do, from their sustainable practices to the experiences they curate. This ethos is perhaps most vividly showcased through their owned media property, Godrej L'Affaire - a brand-agnostic platform to celebrate nuances of lifestyle in an experiential manner. This year’s rollout that culminated recently had a relevant theme - “all things goodness”. This platform sought to highlight the impact of deliberate good choices that contribute positively to society. Over 1000 content creators and celebrities witnessed the magic of over 55 participating brands.Elaborating on the impact, Sujit Patil, Chief Communications Officer, Brand and Corporate Communications, Godrej Industries Group said, “Even large-scale events can be sustainable and to bring out this element, we ensured that at each stage of Godrej L’Affaire, elements of sustainability are demonstrated. The entire event was audited by Skrap, a sustainability leader that helps businesses achieve zero-waste goals. Godrej L'Affaire 2024 achieved a zero-waste-to-landfill milestone through responsible waste management practices. Partnering with Skrap, we diverted an impressive 94.8% of event waste (1,843.2 kgs) from landfills, the same was recycled, composted, reused, or donated. This reduced our carbon footprint by an estimated 2,697 kgs, equivalent to what 44.6 saplings could capture in 10 years or carbon sequestered in 3.1 acres of US forests in a year, or the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by burning 1347 Kgs of coal. Hence establishing the fact that community events can also be highly sustainable. We understand that experiences are powerful. They shape who we are and how we connect with the world. But for experiences to be truly ""good"" they can't exist in a vacuum. A healthy environment is the foundation for a thriving lifestyle, and one cannot tackle climate change with hashtags alone.”This understanding is why, for World Environment Day 2024, Godrej L'Affaire joined hands with the Bhamla Foundation and Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Maharashtra Forest Department, Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai, Maharashtra Pollution Control Board for a campaign aptly christened as #BhoomiNamaskar. Meaning ""Salutation to the Earth"" in Hindi, this campaign highlights the importance of nurturing our land.The campaign's focus on land restoration is timely and critical. As we grapple with the consequences of deforestation and land degradation, #BhoomiNamaskar seeks to inspire our generation to understand and fight for the countless species facing extinction. It's about more than just planting trees—it's about nurturing the land that sustains us, preserving vital water resources, and ensuring a sustainable future.Mr. Patil further added, “By supporting #BhoomiNamaskar, Godrej L'Affaire is demonstrating that a platform celebrating lifestyle can—and should—champion environmental causes. After all, what good is a fashionable wardrobe or a gourmet meal if we don't have a healthy planet to enjoy them on? This collaboration underscores Godrej L'Affaire's holistic view of goodness, one that encompasses personal well-being, community welfare, and environmental health. By participating in and promoting this initiative, we aim to inspire others to take meaningful steps towards a sustainable future. We recognise that the journey towards sustainability is ongoing. We are committed to continually evolving our practices and pushing the boundaries of what it means to be a responsible corporate citizen. Our goal is to create a legacy of goodness that transcends generations, ensuring a better, healthier planet for all.”The success of #BhoomiNamaskar lies in its simplicity and profound impact. It serves as a reminder that every small action counts. Whether it's planting a tree, conserving water, or reducing waste, every effort contributes to the larger goal of restoring our planet- It starts with us.","Godrej Industries strives to integrate the philosophy of Good and Green into everything they do, from their sustainable practices to the experiences they curate.

ACs to ice cream: E-tail booms in cruel summer,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/acs-to-ice-cream-e-tail-booms-in-cruel-summer/articleshow/110809452.cms,"MUMBAI: From ACs to beauty products and even snacking items, consumers are increasingly going online to fill their shopping carts as heatwaves nudge them to stay indoors, at least during the peak afternoon hours.Online sales for Voltas through Amazon and Flipkart, for instance, have grown by 190% year-on-year between March-May 2024. The company's sales through its own website have grown by almost 60% YoY between April and May, a company spokesperson said.The demand for ACs and coolers on Flipkart has almost doubled this May over the year-ago period. While the southern and eastern parts of the country dominated demand in April, the north (largely metros and tier-1 cities) - which has been reeling from a severe heatwave - joined its eastern counterparts to drive demand for cooling products for the platform in May. ""Premium segments of 2 ton and higher have gained momentum...brands like Voltas, Godrej, Lloyd, Haier and Onida have gained share,"" said a company spokesperson.On Amazon, orders for coolers surged from cities like Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Kolkata, Pune and Hyderabad. For Panasonic India, 5-star inverter ACs contribute to 55% of its online AC sales, which is higher than industry average, said Fumiyasu Fujimori, MD at Panasonic Marketing India.E-commerce platforms - with their convenience of doorstep deliveries - continue to find traction among households, particularly when making large purchases. Meanwhile, for daily essentials, small-ticket as well as impulse purchases, quick commerce has become the go-to avenue.Parle's sales through quick commerce platforms like Blinkit, Swiggy Instamart and Zepto have shot up and the segment has seen a 10-15% incremental growth due to the heat, said vice-president Mayank Shah.""The shopping that happens between 10-11am during the day to 6-7pm in the evening has moved online. Consumers are refraining from stepping out. As a consequence, even the online players are having to deploy more manpower and that can be a challenge,"" Shah said.Manish Bandlish, MD at Mother Dairy, said that demand for its ice creams, curd and dairy beverages across online channels has grown upwards of 60% in May, even higher than modern trade which has seen a growth of 40% during the period. For several others too, the trend has been similar.Customers of American brand Baskin Robbins also opted for online channels, including quick commerce platforms, to satisfy their ice cream cravings. ""After the heatwave intensified in north-west India, Baskin Robbins has seen online growth jump from 20-25% in April and first half of May this year to almost 40% and above for the second half of May,"" said Mohit Khattar, CEO at Graviss Foods which is the master franchisee of the brand in India. However, the share of online transactions has been higher among newer consumers, Khattar added.Beauty retailer Colorbar has seen a 5-10% decrease in footfall at its offline stores even as online sales have surged. ""As heatwaves intensify with each passing summer, we have witnessed more consumers opting to stay indoors, favouring the convenience of shopping from home. Moreover, online platforms frequently have bolder promotions... this strategy resonates with the value-conscious consumer segment,"" said Samir Modi, managing director at Colorbar Cosmetics.","Online sales for Voltas have grown by 190% year-on-year between March-May 2024.

RBI warns against 'usurious' rates on small-ticket loans,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rbi-warns-against-usurious-rates-on-small-ticket-loans/articleshow/110809197.cms,"MUMBAI: RBI has said that it is engaging with providers of small-ticket loans who charge 'usurious' interest rates , asking them to ensure transparency and, if necessary, re-examine their business plans.""It has been observed in some microfinance institutions and NBFCs that the interest rates on small-value loans are high and appear to be usurious. The regulatory freedom enjoyed by regulated entities in respect of interest rates and charges should be used judiciously to ensure fair and transparent pricing of products and services,"" said RBI governor Shaktikanta Das in his monetary policy statement.The governor's comments come at a time when there are complaints against digital lenders who extend small-ticket loans at high rates of interest. There have been cases of lenders harassing third parties whose phone numbers have appeared in their systems, even though they have not taken out any loan.""RBI has a fair practices code, but apart from this, all interest rates for banks, finance companies, and microfinance companies are deregulated. Our guidelines require that interest rates should be fair and transparent. We have seen some outliers charging usurious rates and our supervision department is engaging with them,"" said Das. He added that the supervisory officials were monitoring the situation to take further action if needed.According to deputy governor Swaminathan J, the objective is to flag any possible build-up of risks to the lenders. ""We have requested the boards to relook and re-strategise their business plans. We have left it to the individual entities, basis, their business plans... If it is required, they will have to modify their business plans to suit long-term sustainability. That is what we would look for,"" said Swaminathan. He added that RBI is not going to interfere or get into any micromanagement but would leave it to the wisdom of the respective boards.Das also mentioned that in Nov last year, RBI raised concerns about the excessive growth of unsecured retail loans and the over-reliance of NBFCs on bank funding. He said that recent data indicates some moderation in these loans and advances.Recently, RBI had engaged with lenders to increase transparency by asking them to annualise all fixed charges so that customers get an idea of the cost of borrowings. In the past, when the lenders did not respond to signals from RBI, the regulator has not hesitated to step in and place business restrictions.","RBI is engaging with providers of small-ticket loans who charge 'usurious' interest rates.

The rally in the last three sessions has more than wiped out the record 4,390 point crash on Tuesday when general election results were announced.“Markets shrugged off weak global cues as investors cheered RBI's higher growth forecast for FY25 in its credit policy announcement, which propelled sensex to a fresh all-time high on massive broad-based buying support,” Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research), Mehta Equities said.“Also, the arrival of monsoon rains on time and expectations of its even spread across the country raised hopes of softening inflation going ahead. With the election uncertainty now over and the NDA most likely to form the government, investors are hopeful that the action will now shift to reforms and the upcoming Budget.”For a change, Friday’s rally was supported by foreign funds who recorded a net inflow of Rs 4,391 crore, while domestic funds were net sellers at Rs 1,290 crore, end-of-the-session data on BSE showed.The day’s rally added Rs 7 lakh crore to investors’ wealth with BSE’s market capitalisation now at Rs 429.5 lakh crore.The day’s session also saw volatility reducing substantially with India VIX, the measure of volatility, dropping to one-month low of 16. This was a sign of reduced anxiety among investors over the formation of the new government at the Centre, market players said.Going forward, a host of global and local factors are expected to drive the market.

MUMBAI: India's foreign exchange reserves jumped $4.8 billion to hit a record high of $651.5 billion in the week ended May 31, 2024, with the current account deficit significantly shrinking during Q4 FY24 due to strong growth in services and robust remittances.

In his monetary policy statement, RBI governor Shaktikanta Das said India's external sector remains resilient and that key external vulnerability indicators continue to improve. Incidentally, India Ratings said in a report that the current account in Q4 FY24 was likely to have turned into a surplus for the first time in 10 quarters.

""The phenomenal rise of GCCs in India has provided a significant boost to India's software and business services exports,"" said Das.

RBI raises FY25 GDP forecast to 7.2%,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rbi-raises-fy25-gdp-forecast-to-7-2/articleshow/110809022.cms,"MUMBAI: RBI governor Shaktikanta Das on Friday left key policy rates unchanged for the 8th consecutive time but raised growth projection for the current financial year from 7% to 7.2%. The markets were, however, uncertain about when RBI might cut rates.The monetary policy committee decided by a 4 to 2 majority to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.5%. Four of the six members of MPC also voted to remain focused on the withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation progressively aligns with the target while supporting growth.Among the external members, Ashima Goyal and Jayanth R Varma voted to reduce the policy repo rate by 25 basis points (100bps = 1 percentage point), while the three RBI members and Shashanka Bhide voted to keep the rate unchanged. Das maintained that there was need for inflation to descend to the 4% target on a durable basis.""The timing of the first rate cut by RBI remains a difficult question as domestic growth remains strong, which, along with sticky trajectory for food inflation, has meant that RBI MPC members may be reluctant to quickly pivot towards monetary policy easing,"" said Santanu Sengupta of Goldman Sachs.Adding to the uncertainty was RBI's caution to banks on credit growth outpacing deposit growth for long. ""The persisting gap between credit and deposit growth rates warrants a rethink by the boards of banks to re-strategise their business plans. A prudent balance between assets and liabilities has to be maintained,"" he said. In a bid to ensure the full transmission of rate hikes to deposits, RBI revised the definition of bulk deposits to those above Rs 3 crore from Rs 2 crore earlier. According to bankers, this will compel banks that want to grow their deposits to broadbase rate hikes.Announcing the MPC decision, Das said the forecast of above normal monsoon would boost agriculture and rural consumption. ""Private consumption, the mainstay of aggregate demand, is recovering with steady improvement in discretionary spending in urban areas. Investment activity continues to gain traction on the back of expansion in non-food credit,"" said Das.RBI's decision to hold rates comes a day after the European Central Bank cut interest rates and a month after US Fed chief Jerome Powell said that rate hikes were off the table. ""There is a view that in matters of monetary policy, RBI is guided by the principle of following the Fed. I would like to unambiguously state that while we do keep a watch on the clouds that build up or clear out on the distant horizon, we play the game according to the local weather and pitch conditions,"" the governor said.According to RBI forecasts, inflation will briefly come within the target rate during the second quarter, thanks to a higher base effect.

The finance minister set the stage for a ""Viksit Bharat by 2047"", on the core principles of ‘Sabka Saath’, ‘Sabka Vikas’, ‘Sabka Vishwas’, with ‘Sabka Prayas’ being added as a new theme in the interim Budget.This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data i.e., farmer welfare and N for Nari utthan i.e., support for women entrepreneurs. These form the pillars of a comprehensive inclusive development. The Government's commitment to sustainable development under the strategy for Amrit Kaal includes achieving 'Net Zero' by 2070, rooftop solarization for one crore households and robust health initiatives.The Indian economy's resilience takes center stage amidst positive indicators of declining current account deficit as a percentage of GDP, falling unemployment rates, and a notable rise in digital transactions. These statistics affirm the robustness of the economy, showcasing a trajectory of growth and stability.The achievements in taxation reforms are nothing short of remarkable, with direct tax collections more than trebling in the last decade, the number of tax return filers increasing by 2.4 times, average processing time of tax returns plummeting from 93 days in FY 2013-14 to an impressive 10 days in FY 2023-24, resulting in issuance of quick refunds. These are the results of consistent progressive measures thus obviating the need for, and rightly avoiding, any last-minute populist measures.No change in existing tax rates, both for direct and indirect taxes, is a good indicator of stability and predictability for investors and taxpayers.A welcome move to waive outstanding tax demands that are minor, disputed, and unreconciled. This involves the withdrawal of outstanding direct tax demands up to Rs. 25,000 pertaining to the period up to FY 2009-10 and up to Rs.10,000 for FY 2010-11 to 2014-15.The Government's commitment to fostering a business-friendly environment is evident in its intent to extend specific tax benefits for start-ups, investments by sovereign wealth funds/ pension funds, and certain IFSC units. The extension has been made now until March 31, 2025. This might help in creating a conducive landscape for business.To align with the CBDT notification issued earlier, the provisions relating to tax collection at source concerning remittances under the Liberalized Remittance Scheme have now been formally incorporated in the Finance Bill, 2024, setting the rate at 20% for amounts exceeding Rs. 7 lakhs in a financial year.The Finance Bill, 2024 proposes an extension of the time limit for introducing the faceless scheme by the Central Government for transfer pricing proceedings, DRP Proceedings, and ITAT Proceedings, up to March 31, 2025.The interim Budget 2024 may not have proposed significant tax announcements, but it very well positioned the prelude to the full budget post the upcoming elections. Considering the potential impact on the population across the four pillars of GYAN, a sizable portion of India stands to be covered. The interim Budget’s focus on the tax front resembles a report card, highlighting the maturity achieved by our tax system. The enhancement of taxpayer services was emphasized as a key priority.","This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data and N for Nari utthan.

Interim Budget for a Viksit Bharat: It’s for everyone and all,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/interim-budget-for-a-viksit-bharat-its-for-everyone-and-all/articleshow/107497439.cms,"By Akhilesh Tuteja

The Finance Minister on February 01, 2024, delivered a truly innovative interim budget. At first glance, it did not seem like an interim budget but looked more like the budget to drive further growth and a continuum of inclusive growth-oriented investments.At the outset, this budget brings a wonderful balance between fiscal prudence and continued investment for growth. It's not easy to continue the glide path of reducing the fiscal deficit and continuing to make significant investments in all areas including infrastructure, R&D, energy transition, technology, skilling, and social welfare. The surprising reduction in fiscal deficit of 5.8% as against the budgeted 5.9% for FY24 and the projection of 5.1% in FY25 with a clear focus on increasing investments was a huge positive.This was a budget for everyone and all because it caters to every part of the Indian economy and society. The FM has carefully catered to the investment needs of various sectors. The continued focus on youth, impoverished, women and farmers to increase their involvement and contribution to economic growth is evident. By committing an 11.1% increase in capital expenditure to 11,11,111 lakh crore, the FM has clearly brought every single 1 in this growth journey.What was very impressive was the inclusion strategy of the government. The focus on women's empowerment for the past few years is unprecedented, which is reflected in the inclusion of women in the workforce moving from 23.3% to 37% in the last five years. The thirty crore Mudra Yojna loans to women entrepreneurs were a great boost to the Nari Shakti initiative. We already have over 10 million Lakhpati Didis and what is truly evident is like a corporate CFO, the FM has revised the earlier target of 20 million Lakhpati Didis to 30 million. The government also plans to invest in initiatives to encourage young girls between the ages of 9 and 14 to undertake the vaccination for cervical cancer which is again a great boost to Nari Shakti.A lot needs to be done to bring more women into all parts of economic growth but the journey so far and the vision of the future is truly inspiring.While India continues on its technological prowess and makes its mark in new technologies like Artificial Intelligence, we need a multi-pronged strategy to harness the power of AI. We need a clear focus on building AI systems in India so that we not only emerge as a global leader in this new era but can build models, which are specific to India that will benefit Indians. At the same time, we need a very wide coverage program to build skills to leverage AI to its fullest potential. The biggest contribution we can make to the inclusion of youth in the economic development of the country is by skilling them in new skill areas. In the last few years, the Skill India Mission has trained 14 million youth, reskilled over 5 million youth and established a staggering 3,000 new ITIs. The future of any country will depend as much on capital investments as on skill investments.The focus on agricultural development and support to the farmer continues through direct financial assistance to farmers. The farmers have benefited by getting crop insurance through PM Fasal Bima Yojana. It's not just the farmers, the PM-SVANidhi provides credit assistance to a large number of street vendors.The last few years have seen the journey of affordable housing through Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY). There is a slight increase in allocation to launch a scheme for encouraging the middle class to build or buy new homes. This investment will likely propel a wider economic development and increase employment.India has seen a tremendous rise in entrepreneurship in the last few years. In order to continue the journey and promote new startups, the government proposes to extend certain tax benefits, which are expiring from March 2024 to March 2025. The MSMEs have not been left behind. With a proposal to provide timely finances to such enterprises, the government has paved the way for their growth, so they can look to compete globally.All in all, it’s a truly inclusive budget with a clear focus on development not just by giving away freebies but enabling the people to participate in the economic development activity. While the FM calls the comprehensive GDP - Governance, Development & Performance – to me, this budget is inclusive of another GDP – gender, demography, and professions.","Akhilesh Tuteja is Partner and Head, Clients and Markets, KPMG in India.

‘Enough domestic sources of demand to counter drag from external sector’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/enough-domestic-sources-of-demand-to-counter-drag-from-external-sector/articleshow/107372012.cms,"Do you think the

creates room for lower interest rates?

One of the issues that the Budget has flagged is the demographic challenge and opportunity and the societal change that is taking place. How do you view this?

Niti Aayog is working on the Viksit Bharat roadmap. What will be the focus areas?

You are as much a representative of the Centre as well as the states. Is it time to revisit the entire formula for transfers to states particularly on the issue of cesses and surcharges?

Suman Bery , who heads Niti Aayog , the govt think tank, is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China, which he says is also an opportunity for India. The economist is confident that Indian states remain resilient. Excerpts of the interview with TOI.The finance ministry expects the economy to grow 7% next year. Given the global situation, how do you see the prospects?The belief in the finance ministry is that we have a possible drag coming from the external sector but that we have other sources. We have enough domestic sources of demand. One has to applaud the political and economic judgment of FM in deciding that it was appropriate to pursue the path of fiscal consolidation. There is transparency. What this actually reflects is responsible economic management, which is one reason we are where we are. Second, it also creates a buffer so that there is policy space if we do encounter headwinds.That’s the hope and expectation. We have an independent central bank and an inflation targeting central bank, so it is up to the monetary policy committee to take a call through the monetary policy committee on the repo rate .The PM has said that when India grows its states grow. India is a composite of 37 states and UTs. They are each at very different points in their demographic transition. There are some states where the net replacement rate is down to 1%, like Kerala . There are others, particularly UP and Bihar, which are in their earliest stage of demographic transition and each one of these states is the size of a large European country. There are two implications of that — one is internal labour mobility and it will become an even larger part of our growth model. The govt has taken several steps to create a unified market. Our main endowment is our human capital and that has to be equipped to participate in global exchange in many ways. We know from China, Japan that the demographic dividend partly depends on markets and on human capital. But the golden period is fairly short lived, about 15 years, when the so called dependency ratio declines. The other big opportunity the PM has been highlighting is bringing women much more into the active labour force.When Niti was set up there was the idea of a three-year vision and a seven-year strategy paper. The reality is that schemes of govt tend to be aligned with the award of the Finance Commission . There are various established building blocks or hand holds which are already a matter of govt policy. The PM is much more interested in a national debate on what it means to be a Viksit Bharat or modern society. We have a collective goal and it is for the democratic polity to define what that goal should be. Its emphatically not for a super mandarin bureaucracy. It is not going to be Lee Kwan Yew’s Singapore led from the top.It’s entirely a finance ministry matter but I would be lying if I didn’t say when I visit certain states there is this complaint. A big frontier would be resource mobilisation at the state level. Second is going to be rationalisation of subsidies not only at the Union level, but also at the state level. All chief ministers sit on my governing council. When they convene as the governing council, I see them in their role as development practitioners. The world is beginning to appreciate quite how much institutional and political maturity India attained in our 75 years and the most fundamental dimension of a democracy, we have orderly transfers of power. There are enough buffers to ensure that what happens in state finances is unlikely to create macro instability. Those risks are well contained by our Constitution. The chief ministers know that they are going to be judged by development outcomes and so you can have the sugar rush of changing of pension plans or various handouts but if the cupboard is bare you are not going to be able to deliver.","Suman Bery is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China.

Government's Marathon to 2047: Emphasis on Fiscal Prudence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/governments-marathon-to-2047-emphasis-on-fiscal-prudence/articleshow/107371788.cms,"What was the thinking behind keeping the vote on account absolutely straight?

So is it the idea to keep the Budget completely transparent?

The capex has risen 11.1% and there is an emphasis on infrastructure spending. But there is also the hope that the private sector will now take over and start capital spending. Given the geopolitical situation, how confident is the govt that it will pan out as planned?

Finance secretary T V Somanathan, in an interview with TOI, says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047 . Excerpts:If you see the Budget speech you will see the emphasis on 2047. The govt has set its sight on running that marathon. Running to 2047 is a marathon , it’s not a sprint. If you are going to run a marathon, you need to be in good shape and you can’t have short-term stimulants or something that will get you some yards and then it’s done.The whole focus is on making India a developed country by 2047, for which a healthy present and a strong fiscal position is an important concomitant. Some purely short term measures don’t really fit into that picture. It’s a consistent picture: focus on the long term for which you need to build strength in the short term and that needs to be done by prudence in fiscal policy and by not doing things which can detract you from that path. Not doing the wrong thing is more important than appearing to do things.The idea is that govt finances may be good, bad or indifferent depending on the times, depending on the circumstances, depending on the policies. But what is the position should be reflected as reasonably and accurately as possible. That is an emphasis. As regards the Finance Commission, again the terms of reference that have been given to them are the terms in the Constitution.What is the means by which the devolution should be done is a matter they have full discretion. They can actually take all kinds of factors into account and in a sense we felt this time based on my review of the previous commissions that the right expression would be less is more. The shorter, less prescriptive terms of reference gives full scope for all stakeholders including state govts to express their viewpoints and for the commission to take a balanced view of the different perspectives and then come to its award. Ultimately the award of the Finance Commission is about devolution and grant for which full scope has now been given to them.n There are incipient signs of private capital expenditure accelerating. There are some surveys I have seen done by some of the chambers industry, which show high levels of investment. The PMI, which is a sort of leading indicator, is also looking pretty healthy. Capacity utilisation is one reason that private sector capital expenditure doesn’t immediately pick up when the economy starts accelerating because there is surplus capacity.But increasingly I get the sense that many industries are beginning to reach levels where they have to add capacity. When that happens capital investment will happen. Another pointer also mentioned in the Budget speech you may notice that our airlines have placed large orders for planes — that is capital expenditure.When you import 1,000 aircraft, it’s just not 1,000 aircraft, there are concomitant additions to ground handling facilities, you need airports to expand, you need to employ people to do that. That means a lot of jobs. The aircraft is capital but then look at the effect it is going to have on skilled jobs. So capital expenditure is happening. I am fairly confident that we will have decent capital expenditure in the year to come and that will become a new source of acceleration.",Finance secretary T V Somanathan says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047. The capex has risen 11.1% and there is an emphasis on infrastructure spending.

Income Tax Changes Budget 2024 : In the recent Budget 2024 speech, the Finance Minister kept the Section 80C tax deduction limit unchanged. The maximum limit for claiming tax benefits under Section 80C remains at Rs 1.5 lakh for the current fiscal year 2023-24 and will stay the same for individuals looking to save on taxes through Section 80C investments in the upcoming fiscal year 2024-25.Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions. Individuals can reduce their gross taxable income by up to Rs 1.5 lakh per financial year by engaging in these specific investments or expenditures.You can save on taxes through Section 80C by investing in things like Employees' Provident Fund (EPF), Public Provident Fund (PPF), Equity Linked Saving Scheme (ELSS) mutual funds, National Savings Certificate (NSC), and 5-year tax-saving fixed deposits with banks or post offices. Additionally, paying life insurance policy premiums also qualifies for tax benefits under Section 80C.It is important to note that each eligible investment comes with its specific maximum limit, rate of return, liquidity, and taxation rules for the earned returns, states ET in a report. For instance, the most you can invest in PPF in a financial year is Rs 1.5 lakh. Meanwhile, there's no limit on the amount you can invest in ELSS mutual funds, but the Section 80C deduction is capped at Rs 1.5 lakh.If individuals can't make specific investments, they can still get deductions under Section 80C from their gross taxable income through certain expenses. These expenses include repaying the principal amount of a home loan, tuition fees for children, payment of stamp duty, registration fees, and other costs related to buying a house.Since the financial year 2020-21, individuals without any business income must annually choose between the old and new tax regimes. As of the fiscal year 2023-24, the new tax regime is the default option. Consequently, individuals seeking tax deductions under Section 80C must opt for the old tax regime since this deduction isn't available in the new tax regime. It's crucial for taxpayers to be aware of these rules to make informed decisions about their tax planning and investment strategies.","Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget which is an interim budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year. The budget talks about inclusive development both, social and geographical, especially for youth, women, farmers, and the poor. Continued focus on improving logistics through infrastructure spend on roads, rail, airports, ports increases productivity for companies and citizens alike.To make ‘Viksit Bharat’ by 2047, the government’s focus is on improving and empowering people’s capabilities through various skilling initiatives. It is encouraging to see that Skill India Mission has succeeded in training more than 1.4 crore youth and upskilling and reskilling 54 lakh youth. I am particularly happy to see the continued focus on youth and women entrepreneurship and the announcement of a new fund which will give interest free 50 year loans for startups will provide a domestic fillip to startups supplementing venture capital we have traditionally relied on from abroad.PM Mudra Yojana has sanctioned 43 crore loans aggregating to 22.5 lakh crore to youth entrepreneurs and thirty crore Mudra Yojana loans to women entrepreneurs. There are several other schemes like Fund of Funds, Start-Up India, and Start-Up Credit Guarantee schemes that are assisting our youth. Further, the extension of tax benefits to Start-ups and investments made by sovereign wealth funds/pension funds, till 31st March 2025 depicts the government’s effort to support the startup eco- system.This aligns quite well with India Sanitation Coalition’s efforts to give impetus to the start-up world. Over the past 7 editions of our ISC-FICCI Sanitation Awards, we have recognized and promoted several start-ups in the sanitation space, many of whom are successful businesses now!While the finance minister did not provide detailed information on Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH), the budget allocation sees a slight increase in spend demonstrating continued focus on this highly successful program. The acknowledgement that the private sector has increasingly played a substantial role in addressing WASH issues in both urban and rural areas, with numerous projects underway through Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs), highlights the government's commitment to addressing challenges in this sector.A perfect example is the LightHouse Initiative initiated by the Department of Drinking Water along with the India Sanitation Coalition (ISC) by partnering with major corporates across India to develop model villages in Solid and Liquid Waste Management (SLWM) under SBM-Grameen. From this budget, there is an expectation that the government will persist in prioritizing Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) as the path toward achieving the country's Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6). Additionally, it is hoped that the government will uphold its commitment to making necessary infrastructural investments for SLWM.The budget speech rightly celebrates the fact that we have 83 lakh SHGs and 9 crore women beneficiaries. The microfinance movement in the country and the possibility of empowering women members of SHGs through livelihood skilling is a key to bringing women into mainstream economic advancement.The focus on green growth, rooftop solar, wind, biomass, e-vehicles all help with our green energy thrust. The tourism sector was mentioned and could be a huge job provider for youth and women.Guided by the principle ‘Reform, Perform, and Transform’, the budget emphasizes efficient implementation of various policies by improving coordination with states and relevant stakeholders. This is critical both for infra spend and social programsIt is noteworthy that ISC’s Climate Resilient Coastal Cities project which is being implemented in PPP (Public-Private Partnership) mode in four coastal states of Karnataka, Gujarat, Goa and Maharashtra is congruent with the government’s priority of promoting climate-resilient activities for the blue economy 2.0, a scheme for restoration and adaptation measures, and coastal aquaculture.The budget also focuses on the Aspirational districts program where assistance will be given to the states for faster development of aspirational districts and blocks, including the generation of ample economic opportunities. This is again very crucial as it has a huge potential to transform the landscape of our country while making sure no -one is left behind.Overall, this budget has embraced economic strategies and develops the building blocks that nurture and uphold growth, promote inclusive and sustainable development, and enhance productivity.","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year.

But Novo Nordisk's research journey started about two decades ago."" The company's research into new treatments for diabetes led to the discovery of benefits of weight management, prompting a separate research programme. Dawber said the demand for these products has surprised the company.The teams in Novo Nordisk Global Business Services (GBS) based in Bengaluru have collaborated with the global teams to contribute towards the Ozempic programme. Dawber said the Bengaluru team collaborates closely with the headquarters on the semaglutide drug, working on clinical trials, biostatistics, data management, pharmacovigilance, and global safety. It employs 4,000 employees.Prasanna Kumar T S, VP of global safety in Novo Nordisk GBS, said the role of the biostatistics unit in Bengaluru, which conducts all statistical analysis and reporting for Ozempic. ""Our trial statisticians and clinical data scientists engage with the trial squad right from protocol development until the submission of a trial/product to regulatory authorities."" Biostatistics applies statistical methods to health data.Biostatistics, Dawber said, is a highly technical area and something that traditionally the pharma companies keep very close to the headquarters. ""We have a team of 150 biostatistics experts in Bengaluru. The VP who heads that function also heads the biostatistics team in Denmark and in the US. Something very highly technical like biostats, we have the global leadership sitting here, and they manage teams here and in other geographies,"" he said.Kumar said the global medical affairs team played a pivotal role in the development of Semaglutide.

For the analyst Adrian Jones , the mission of wealth generation is clear. The analyst was able to predict Bitcoin's new all-time high, and now, as he enjoys his astounding gains, he has set his eyes on another target: Cosmic Kittens ( CKIT ). As he shares his prediction, the crypto world seems to be in a frenzy as people follow in his footsteps and delve into the feline GameFi project’s presale.But what makes a new entrant so good that the expert is putting his weight behind the new token? Let’s deep dive into Cosmic Kittens, the project, and what it brings to the world.GameFi, the amalgam of Game and Finance, is a bustling crypto sector that has changed how modern games are built and played. Look back at your childhood and take any game you loved to play. All the coins collected, points made, and high scores were eventually of no use. After you were done with the game, you simply moved on, and that effort and progress you made was wasted.GameFi changed all that. By merging crypto and entertainment, players earn real tokens, which (while having the same in-game properties of purchasing power) can be sold and traded on different crypto exchanges. According to GameFi aggregator DeGame, Q1 of 2024 has seen the sector trade over $1.1 billion in volume, showcasing that there is more to come.1This means that Cosmic Kittens is entering the market at a time when there is a clear and increasing demand for good games that catch the eye and Cosmic Kittens does that pretty well.As the name suggests, Cosmic Kittens is all about cats and the cosmos—Cosmo Kittania, to be exact. It is a different universe where cats have achieved space flight and now explore the vast universe. As they travel, they need resources, gathering materials needed for their survival.Gamers take charge of the cats, becoming their owners. Intelligent as the cats are, they rely on their owners to take care of them. This means users will need to interact with their pets frequently, ensuring they are fed and get sufficient exercise. Furthermore, owners can also start a lineage, mating their cats with others to produce a cute litter of kittens.Does this sound familiar? The pet/owner relationship echoes past crazes such as Tamagotchi, where players took care of their pets on small digital devices. The breeding part is inspired by games such as Pokemon and Digimon.Unlike other games in the blockchain industry, Cosmic Kittens’ users are on a journey of exploration that creates a bond with their digital pets.All the cats in the Cosmic Kittens game are represented as NFTs. That means pet owners are truly owners who have control over their feline partners, not the game developers. With the NFTs, users are free to trade their cats, flipping profits as they develop and enhance their pets.But with the breeding element, Cosmic Kittens takes another leap. Gamers can mate their feline friends and produce litters of cute furry kittens. The best part is that these new kittens take on different attributes of their parents, creating unique combinations that can range from common to rare. Thus, players can fastrack their journey with the kittens or make profits by selling them off in the marketplace.The Cosmic Kittens gameplay and ecosystem are underpinned by its CKIT token. The token can be used to purchase in-game items or different decor for the cats, like sunglasses, clothes, or even upgrading their abilities. On the other hand, users can cash out when players sell extra resources or their cats in the dedicated marketplace.CKIT tokens also help users get early VIP access to planned activities, such as special edition cats, art drops, and more. As the Cosmic Kittens ecosystem develops, more and more VIP services will be launched, making CKIT tokens the gateway token.As such, crypto is expected to be in extreme demand, especially once it is made available to the general public. As of now, it is available only in its upcoming presale. Crypto enthusiasts understand the event’s importance and like the Adrian Jones who has predicted a 50x gain, many are already signed up.Standing at the crossroads of gaming, NFTs, and explosive growth, Cosmic Kittens is a crypto project that is the talk of the town. The deflationary CKIT token is available in limited quantity during its presale, so if you want to take the plunge for better chances of wealth generation and hours of gameplay, the suggestion is you book your slot today before it’s too late!","Cosmic Kittens (CKIT) is a feline GameFi project.

There's a lot of retail money that's piling in on what they see as a straight shot up.""Nvidia's stock has experienced a remarkable 147% surge year-to-date, fueled by the overwhelming demand for its high-end processors as major tech giants like Microsoft, Meta Platforms, and Alphabet (Google's parent company) compete to enhance their AI computing capabilities and establish dominance in this emerging technology.The company's market capitalization increased by nearly $150 million on Wednesday alone, surpassing the total value of AT&T.The enthusiasm for AI has also lifted other chip stocks, with the PHLX chip index climbing 4.5% on Wednesday. Super Micro Computer, a company that sells AI-optimized servers equipped with Nvidia chips, saw its stock rise by 4%.While Nvidia rides the wave of AI excitement on Wall Street, Apple faces challenges such as weak iPhone demand and intense competition in China, the world's largest smartphone market. Some investors also perceive Apple as lagging behind other tech giants in incorporating AI features into their products and services.Despite Nvidia's stock gains outpacing analysts' projections for its future earnings, the company's valuation remains more attractive compared to a year ago.

Nvidia is also preparing to split its stock ten-for-one, effective June 7, a move aimed at increasing its appeal to individual investors.The surge in Nvidia's market value above Apple's marks a significant shift in Silicon Valley, where Apple, co-founded by Steve Jobs, has dominated since the iPhone's launch in 2007. Nvidia's stock rose 5.2% to close at $1,224.40, valuing the company at $3.012 trillion. Meanwhile, Apple's market capitalization stood at $3.003 trillion after its stock climbed 0.8%.""Nvidia is making money on AI right now, and companies like Apple and Meta are spending on AI,"" said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer at Longbow Asset Management. ""It may be a foregone conclusion that Nvidia will overtake Microsoft as well. There's a lot of retail money that's piling in on what they see as a straight shot up.""Nvidia's stock has surged 147% so far in 2024, driven by soaring demand for its top-of-the-line processors. These processors are essential as Microsoft, Meta Platforms, and Google-owner Alphabet race to build out their AI computing capabilities and dominate the emerging technology. The company's stock has rallied nearly 30% since May 22, following a stellar revenue forecast.Nvidia added nearly $150 million in market capitalization on Wednesday alone, more than the entire value of AT&T. The optimism surrounding AI also lifted chip stocks broadly, with the PHLX chip index surging 4.5%. Super Micro Computer, which sells AI-optimized servers built with Nvidia chips, climbed 4%.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently received extensive media coverage in Taiwan and was greeted enthusiastically at the Computex tech trade fair in Taipei. Meanwhile, Apple is facing challenges with weak demand for iPhones and stiff competition in China, the world's largest smartphone market. Some investors view Apple as lagging behind other tech giants in integrating AI features into their products and services.Despite Nvidia's impressive gains, analysts' projections for its future earnings have outpaced its stock performance. Nvidia is currently trading at 39 times expected earnings, a significant reduction from a year ago when it traded at over 70 times expected earnings, according to LSEG data.The chipmaker has seen a dramatic increase in demand for its semiconductors, which are crucial for powering AI applications. Nvidia's revenue more than tripled in the latest quarter compared to the same period a year earlier. Wall Street expects Nvidia to bring in $117 billion in revenue for fiscal 2025, nearly double its revenue for 2024 and more than four times its revenue from the year before.Nvidia's estimated net margin stands at 53%, significantly higher than Apple's 26.3% and Microsoft's 36.4%. Although Apple and Microsoft have higher overall revenues, Nvidia's profitability underscores its dominant position in the AI market.Wall Street stocks closed higher on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq hitting fresh highs as Nvidia crossed the $3 trillion market capitalization mark. The S&P 500 surged 1.2% to 5,354.03, while the Nasdaq Composite Index rallied 2.0% to 17,187.90. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3% to 38,807.33.""You have kind of the best of both worlds for the stock market in that you have lower interest rates and strength in the mega-cap stocks, specifically, Nvidia,"" said Patrick O'Hare of Briefing.com. Other major names, including Meta Platforms, advanced 3.8%, while Hewlett Packard Enterprise bounced 10.7%. Apple shares rose 0.8%.Economic data showed private sector hiring cooled more than expected in May, potentially giving the Federal Reserve confidence to cut interest rates sooner. All eyes are on the government's jobs report due Friday for further indications of the economy's trajectory and potential rate adjustments.(With inputs from agencies)","N Nvidia's stock rose 5.2% to close at $1,224.40. Apple's market capitalization stood at $3.003 trillion after its stock climbed 0.8%.

Tesla shareholder sues Musk for alleged $7.5 billion insider trading,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/tesla-shareholder-sues-musk-for-alleged-7-5-billion-insider-trading/articleshow/110608901.cms,"NEW DELHI: A Tesla shareholder, on Thursday, sued Elon Musk engaged in insider trading by selling over $7.5 billion worth of shares in the electric car manufacturer in late 2022.Shareholder Michael Perry filed the lawsuit in Delaware Chancery Court, contending that Musk sold the shares before the public disclosure of potentially disappointing production and delivery figures, resulting in an estimated $3 billion in insider profits for Musk. Tesla's share price plummeted after the company's fourth-quarter numbers were made public on January 2, 2023.""Musk exploited his position at Tesla, and he breached his fiduciary duties to Tesla,"" the lawsuit said, asking the court to direct Musk to return the profits made from the trades.According to the lawsuit, Musk sold the shares on multiple occasions between November and December 2022. The complaint also accuses Tesla's directors of failing in their fiduciary duty by permitting Musk to execute the sales.As of the report, neither Musk nor Tesla had responded to requests for comment from Reuters.Perry alleges that Musk, who had previously touted strong demand for Tesla vehicles in 2022, became aware of lower-than-anticipated figures in mid-November, utilizing his access to real-time data to sell his shares before the information became public. Following the revelation of vehicle price discounts and the subsequent release of figures in January, Tesla's stock experienced a significant decline.""Had (Musk) waited to make these sales until after the release of material adverse news,... his sales would have netted him less than 55% of the amounts realized from his November and December 2022 sales,"" the lawsuit said.This legal action adds to Musk's ongoing legal challenges. Notably, Tesla shareholders are set to vote on June 13 regarding the ratification of Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge nullified in January due to improper control exerted by Musk.Additionally, Musk is under regulatory scrutiny for potential violations of federal securities laws related to his acquisition of shares in Twitter, later rebranded as X. Musk has criticized the US securities and exchange commission, accusing them of harassment through unwarranted investigations.Musk and the top US markets regulator have been in a years-long feud, dating back to 2018 when he tweeted that he had ""funding secured"" to take Tesla private.A separate shareholder lawsuit has accused Musk of defrauding X investors by delaying disclosing his stake in the social media company to amass lower-priced shares.(With inputs from the agency)","A Tesla shareholder, on Thursday, sued Elon Musk engaged in insider trading by selling over $7.5 billion worth of shares in the electric car manufacturer in late 2022.

New meme coin with 100x potential prepares for launch,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/new-meme-coin-with-100x-potential-prepares-for-launch-last-chance-to-invest-in-dogeverse-presale/articleshow/110597550.cms,"Dogeverse lives on 6 chains, creating unique opportunity for cross-chain applications

Dogeverse Is poised to soar to top of Meme Coin charts

Analysts line up behind Dogeverse, predict massive gains

Staking rewards limit selling pressure around launch, ensuring explosive price action

Dogeverse , a multi-chain meme coin built on 6 of the most popular blockchain networks, is readying for launch after one of the most successful presales of 2024. The project raised more than $15 million, putting it among the top 70 meme coins in the world by market cap.Investors and traders now have just 3 days remaining to buy $DOGEVERSE before it hits exchanges. The presale will officially end on Monday, June 3, at 10am UTC. However, it could close even sooner if Dogeverse sells out the remaining tokens in its $17 million hard cap.The presale will be followed by a token claim two days later, on Wednesday, June 5, at 10am UTC. $DOGEVERSE will simultaneously list on decentralized exchanges on Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, Polygon, Binance Smart Chain, and Base immediately following the token claim.Analysts expect that $DOGEVERSE will explode higher after trading begins. So, this is the final chance to join Dogeverse before the token shoots for the moon and potentially delivers enormous gains for everyone who bought tokens during the presale. Dogeverse is something that the meme coin world has never seen before: a token that lives not just on Ethereum or Solana, but on six of the most popular blockchains.Dogeverse is native to Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, Polygon, Binance Smart Chain, and Base. Investors can buy the token on any of these networks, and it will list for trading on exchanges on all of them at the same time.That means the scale of Dogeverse’s launch will be unprecedented. The token will be instantly available to holders of all ERC-20 tokens, all BSC-20 tokens, $AVAX, $SOL, Solana meme coins, and Base meme coins.The potential audience of traders buying $DOGEVERSE and pushing up its price immediately after launch is enormous. Ethereum remains the largest and most popular blockchain network for altcoins, but Solana, Base, and Avalanche are quickly growing in importance. By launching on all of these networks, Dogeverse ensures that it will benefit from growth in any of these chains instead of potentially being stuck on a network that goes out of favor.Dogeverse also has inherent value because of what the project team calls multi-bridge utility. Dogeverse can transfer assets between major blockchains with no wrapped tokens and low gas fees.It’s an elegant solution to one of the biggest problems in Web3—how to get blockchains to work together. Dogeverse opens the door to cross-chain applications in DeFi, crypto gaming, crypto trading, metaverse development, and more. It could ultimately serve as the foundation of a more connected and accessible blockchain ecosystem.The Dogeverse presale raised $15 million, an amount that has caught many meme coin traders’ attention. This is already one of the largest meme coin ICOs of all time and puts $DOGEVERSE in the top 70 meme coins by market cap.Dogeverse could quickly move up through the charts. A recently launched dog-themed meme coin, Dog-go-to-the-Moon ($DOG), rocketed from a $10 million market cap to a $825 million market cap within just two weeks of launching. $DOG has no utility and no staking, and began with a much smaller community around it compared to $DOGEVERSE.So, Dogeverse could not only replicate Dog-go-to-the-Moon’s trajectory, but exceed it. A $1 billion market cap could potentially be in reach, putting $DOGEVERSE ahead of hugely successful Solana meme coins like Book of Meme.It also helps that 7 out of 10 meme coins in the top 10 are dog-themed. Dogeverse builds on the legacy of the ultra-successful doge meme with its chain-hopping, space-faring mascot, Cosmo.Crypto analysts have also been extremely bullish on Dogeverse, a strong signal that the token is poised for gains. One analyst, Jacob ‘Crypto’ Bury, predicted that Dogeverse could soar as much as 100x after launch.https://www.youtube.com/embed/XDT7PBzdjwAOther analysts have been more conservative, but still extremely bullish. YouTube influencer ClayBro predicted a 20x gain for $DOGEVERSE, while Myles G Investments predicted a 10x gain. Together, these three analysts boast a combined following of more than 230,000 subscribers.Dogeverse has also gotten a lot of positive coverage in crypto media. Decrypt, Bitcoin.com, The Economic Times, Crypto.news, CryptoPotato, NewsBTC, and Cryptonews.com have all covered Dogeverse’s presale. The crypto community clearly expects this launch to make a big splash.$DOGEVERSE investors who buy during the final days of the presale have the option to stake their tokens to earn 44% APY rewards. This is an opportunity to earn even more $DOGEVERSE before the token’s price begins climbing.Importantly, staking can also limit selling pressure in the immediate aftermath of the token launch. Staking rewards vest 7 days after trading beings, meaning traders who sell immediately will forfeit their reward tokens. Staking rewards will be distributed over a two-year period.https://twitter.com/The_DogeVerse/status/1795817514481443278?ref_src=twsrc%5EtfwWithout selling from presale investors, it’s likely that demand will far outstrip available supply in the days after Dogeverse’s launch. That translates to explosive upward price action similar to the kind that have produced 10x or greater gains for other meme coins in the past.The next three days are the final opportunity investors have to buy $DOGEVERSE before the token launches. Don’t miss this chance to get the next meme coin to explode before the rocket takes off.Disclaimer: The above content is non-editorial, and TIL hereby disclaims any and all warranties, expressed or implied, relating to the same.
