"Boost for India’s semiconductor prowess! Tata Electronics starts exporting chip samples to partners in Japan, US, Europe",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/boost-for-indias-semiconductor-prowess-tata-electronics-starts-exporting-chip-samples-to-partners-in-japan-us-europe/articleshow/109900940.cms,"Semiconductor chips

Tata Electronics Ltd has commenced exporting a limited number of semiconductor chips packaged at its pilot line in its Bengaluru-based R&D centre, according to sources familiar with the matter. These packaged chips are being sent to some of Tata Electronics' partners located in Japan, the US, and Europe. This development comes as the Tata group company prepares for its new chip packaging unit in Assam and a $10 billion chip foundry in Gujarat.According to an ET report quoting a source, ""Tata Electronics has packaged chips there which they are sending to customers right now outside the country. They have multiple partners and are expanding their customer base. Some of these (products) are still in the pilot stage.""Another person revealed that the company is also close to successfully completing a tape-out of semiconductor chips in various nodes, including 28, 40, 55, and 65 nm, as well as some higher nodes. The tape-out is the final result of the designing process for integrated circuits or printed circuit boards before they are sent for manufacturing.The person added, ""There are multiple rounds before a successful tape-out. So, some of these products will be in advanced stages of R&D and they will be sent to select customers to obtain feedback for testing and improvement. Commercial production is slated for 2027.""The chips that have been packaged and are currently being exported by Tata Electronics could be used in various products as they have not been designed for a specific purpose. The source explained, ""When you package the chips, it really does not matter what the chips are used for. It is just a matter of when you package them and prepare them to be used. Tata Electronics has products in multiple areas.""In April, the financial daily reported that Tata Electronics had entered into a strategic agreement with Tesla to provide semiconductor chips for the latter's worldwide operations. However, Tata Electronics did not respond to ET's inquiries regarding this matter.According to Neil Shah, vice president at market research firm Counterpoint Research, it is crucial for Tata Group to begin showcasing its chip designing and manufacturing abilities to prospective clients and partners before the fabs are operational in the next 30-36 months. Shah suggested that Tata could leverage its comprehensive expertise and vision from the early semiconductor design development work the company has been engaged in, either through Tata Elxsi, which has collaborations with Renesas and Lattice Semi, or through its internal branch, Sankhya Labs.Also Read | Apple Awas Yojana? Apple ecosystem to now build residential facilities for workers after creating 1.5 lakh direct jobs ""Tata Electronics should set up solid front-end processes for co-design, testing and quality assurance processes for final production chip tape-outs when the fab is up,"" he said. ""They must also formulate diligent back-end ATMP processes, services and pilots to achieve global manufacturing standards, lucrative yield rates and become a one-stop shop for both semiconductor design and manufacturing in India.""The Tata group's chip foundry in Dholera, established in partnership with Taiwan's Powerchip Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (PSMC), has a planned capacity of up to 50,000 wafer starts per month. The facility is anticipated to manufacture chips in advanced nodes such as 28 nm and 40 nm, as well as some legacy or mature nodes like 55 nm, 90 nm, and 110 nm.The Tata-PSMC joint venture is set to focus on manufacturing chips in specific nodes before transitioning to the 22 nm segment. Currently, several small and medium-scale packaging companies in India, including Tessolve Semiconductor, CDIL, and SCL, are engaged in similar activities. However, experts suggest that their scale of operations will not match that of larger players like Micron or Tata Group.In addition to the foundry, Tata Group is also developing an outsourced assembly and testing (OSAT) unit in Assam. This crucial step in the semiconductor value chain involves assembling or packaging wafers produced by semiconductor fabs and testing them before they are used in the final product.CG Power is also working on a chip assembly and testing unit in Sanand, Gujarat. Other OSAT plants, such as the one announced by the HCL Group-Foxconn group joint venture and another by Hiranandani Group's Tarq Semiconductors in partnership with Kaynes Technology, are currently awaiting government approval.","Tata Electronics Ltd has commenced exporting a limited number of semiconductor chips packaged at its pilot line in its Bengaluru-based R&D centre.

Tata motors Punches at Maruti's best-seller,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tata-motors-punches-at-marutis-best-seller/articleshow/109898850.cms,"New Delhi: The most popular car of the country is not a Maruti any more, but a Tata. In one of the biggest reversals in Indian car industry, Tata's 'mini SUV ' Punch has emerged as the country's largest-selling model, ahead of some of Maruti's popular models like WagonR , Swift, and Brezza.The feat was first achieved in March 2024 where Punch was ahead on total sales of 17,547 units against 16,368 units by WagonR, which was third.In March, the surprise number two was Hyundai's SUV Creta that accounted for 16,458 units, according to numbers sourced from industry analysts.Punch repeated the feat in April as well with 19,158 units against 17,850 units of WagonR. Maruti's Brezza SUV was the third-largest seller in the month at 17,113 units. This perhaps is one of the rare instances where a Maruti model has not been the biggest-seller in the country. And, the fact that Punch holding on to leadership position for two straight months shows that the trend can be sustained.The numbers display changing dynamics in Indian car industry and brings out turnaround scripted by Tata Motors over past few years where it moved up to emerge as the country's third largest-selling car company behind Maruti and Hyundai. Models such as Punch, Nexon, Tiago and Altroz have fuelled the comeback.There had been months in FY24 where Tata pipped Hyundai to second position and many predict the company may emerge as the second-largest seller, considering the pace at which it is launching cars and its dominance in electric vehicle space.Punch has petrol, CNG and electric versions and its price starts from Rs 6.1 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi) for petrol versions and above Rs 11 lakh for electric.However, Maruti still dominates Indian market. This is evident from the fact that in March, six out of top 10 most-selling models were from Maruti and this number was seven in April. Maruti continues to see strong traction in the retail market as it adjusts production of models in line with waiting periods for individual cars, which impacts sales of certain vehicles, say analysts.Tata, however, is on a high, and the confidence is only growing as its models get higher acceptance in market. The company has been adding electrics to existing models, while also looking at driving in 'born electric' or pureplay green cars.","Punch has petrol, CNG and electric versions and its price starts from Rs 6.1 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi) Maruti still dominates Indian market.

"Stock market today: BSE Sensex tanks over 400 points; Nifty50 below 22,350",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/stock-market-today-bse-sensex-nifty50-may-7-2024-dalal-street-indian-equities-global-markets-us-federal-reserve/articleshow/109901202.cms,",

Domestic benchmark indices, BSE Sensex and Nifty50, showed weakness despite positive signals from global markets . Globally, markets continue to display buoyancy due to expectations of central bank rate cuts later this year. While BSE Sensex dipped over 400 points, Nifty50 fell below 22,350. At 10:50 AM, BSE Sensex was trading at 73,469.83, down 426 points or 0.58%.Nifty50 was at 22,318.65, down 124 points or 0.55%.The Indian market has been underperforming recently, despite positive global cues. While the Dow has been on an upward trend for four consecutive trading sessions, the Nifty has become highly volatile and apprehensive. According to V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Servicesthere could be several reasons behind this phenomenon.One potential factor is the selling by FIIs, which amounted to Rs 5525 crores in the first three trading sessions of May. However, this is not unusual, as FIIs tend to sell when US bond yields are attractive.Another significant factor that might be contributing to the market's apprehension is the unexpectedly low turnout in the elections so far. Some believe that the definite and smooth victory of the ruling dispensation is now somewhat uncertain, V K Vijayakumar was quoted as saying by ET. The market, which had already discounted a BJP/NDA victory, is now a bit unsure, he said. This uncertainty could be the reason behind the apprehension in the market and the bulls shedding their aggressive stance, he added.Over the last month, the VIX has spiked by 46% and is currently hovering around 16.6, indicating that volatility and uncertainty are likely to persist for some time.The Indian equity markets experienced a gradual decline on Monday, despite opening higher, amidst heightened volatility. Analysts attributed the increasing nervousness among investors to ongoing global uncertainties and the upcoming Lok Sabha election results.Siddhartha Khemka, Head of Retail Research at Motilal Oswal, said, ""Hence, markets are likely to remain in a broader range with stock-specific action in the near term.""Technical analysis by Tejas Shah, Technical Research, JM Financial & BlinkX, indicates that the Nifty is expected to remain volatile within the range of 22,200–22,800 in the near term, with a negative bias. The immediate resistance zone for Nifty is at 22,600-625 levels, with the next resistance at the 22,800 mark.US stock indexes closed higher on Monday, marking their third consecutive session of advances, as investors grew more optimistic about the possibility of the US Federal Reserve cutting interest rates this year.Asian stocks followed suit, rising in early trading, while oil prices ticked up slightly following Israel's strike on Rafah in Gaza. The Japanese yen continued to weaken against the US dollar due to significant interest rate differentials.Foreign portfolio investors were net sellers on Monday, offloading shares worth Rs 2,168 crore, while domestic institutional investors bought shares worth Rs 781 crore. The Indian rupee settled 7 paise lower at 83.52 against the US dollar, weighed down by elevated crude oil prices. The net short position of FIIs reduced from Rs 46,719 crore on Friday to Rs 35,038 crore on Monday.Several companies, including PB Fintech and Dr Reddy's, are set to announce their fourth-quarter earnings on Tuesday. Investors will be closely monitoring these results for insights into the performance of these companies and their respective sectors.","BSE Sensex and Nifty50 showed weakness despite positive signals from global markets.

He also said that the properties and businesses managed by him are not part of ""any alleged Kalyani joint family estate "".Baba's nephew and niece Sameer Hiremath and Pallavi Swadi have sought a division of the Kalyani family estate , demanding a one-ninth share across listed companies such as Bharat Forge and Kalyani Steel as well as immovable properties in Pune and elsewhere in Maharashtra.Baba said Sameer and Pallavi - children of his sister Sugandha Hiremath , who is also a director of Hikal - are not coparceners of the Kalyani joint family unit. Therefore, they have ""no locus standi to file a suit"" seeking partition of any unit formed within the Kalyani family.Law allows Sugandha to be a coparcener in the Kalyani joint family estate but it doesn't extend the same to her children, said Baba in his statement filed before the Pune civil court. On Monday, the siblings had requested the court to halt their uncle from disposing of the family assets.Baba's statement said that his grandfather Annappa Kalyani was not a wealthy businessman nor did he leave behind a large estate as alleged by his niblings. He left some agricultural lands and residential houses, which after discharging debts, were distributed among his legal heirs including Sugandha. But, before his demise in Feb 1964, he had gifted Rs 2 lakh to his son Neelkanth Kalyani (Baba's father).Using the gifted money and his savings, Neelkanth started various businesses. He subsequently acquired certain assets through the earnings of the businesses and grew the Kalyani enterprise. ""There was no HUF formed during the lifetime of Annappa,"" Baba said.But, Neelkanth had formed a HUF and was the karta of it. However, no business/investments was started/made as the karta of any HUF. “These were started/run in their individual capacity and without any aid from the joint family resources,” said the chairman of Bharat Forge.Subsequently, Baba (75) took the Kalyani Group to greater heights. He “built various companies on his own merit and skills, and with his own personal investments”. Hence, a “casual reference to various properties mentioned in the suit and a fishing enquiry about the other alleged properties of the alleged Kalyani HUF is nothing but an ill motivated and malicious litigation filed by the plaintiffs for harassing members of the Kalyani family,” read Baba’s statement.","Baba's nephew and niece Sameer Hiremath and Pallavi Swadi have sought a division of the Kalyani family estate.

The finance minister set the stage for a ""Viksit Bharat by 2047"", on the core principles of ‘Sabka Saath’, ‘Sabka Vikas’, ‘Sabka Vishwas’, with ‘Sabka Prayas’ being added as a new theme in the interim Budget.This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data i.e., farmer welfare and N for Nari utthan i.e., support for women entrepreneurs.These form the pillars of a comprehensive inclusive development. The Government's commitment to sustainable development under the strategy for Amrit Kaal includes achieving 'Net Zero' by 2070, rooftop solarization for one crore households and robust health initiatives.The Indian economy's resilience takes center stage amidst positive indicators of declining current account deficit as a percentage of GDP, falling unemployment rates, and a notable rise in digital transactions. These statistics affirm the robustness of the economy, showcasing a trajectory of growth and stability.The achievements in taxation reforms are nothing short of remarkable, with direct tax collections more than trebling in the last decade, the number of tax return filers increasing by 2.4 times, average processing time of tax returns plummeting from 93 days in FY 2013-14 to an impressive 10 days in FY 2023-24, resulting in issuance of quick refunds. These are the results of consistent progressive measures thus obviating the need for, and rightly avoiding, any last-minute populist measures.No change in existing tax rates, both for direct and indirect taxes, is a good indicator of stability and predictability for investors and taxpayers.A welcome move to waive outstanding tax demands that are minor, disputed, and unreconciled. This involves the withdrawal of outstanding direct tax demands up to Rs. 25,000 pertaining to the period up to FY 2009-10 and up to Rs.10,000 for FY 2010-11 to 2014-15.The Government's commitment to fostering a business-friendly environment is evident in its intent to extend specific tax benefits for start-ups, investments by sovereign wealth funds/ pension funds, and certain IFSC units. The extension has been made now until March 31, 2025. This might help in creating a conducive landscape for business.To align with the CBDT notification issued earlier, the provisions relating to tax collection at source concerning remittances under the Liberalized Remittance Scheme have now been formally incorporated in the Finance Bill, 2024, setting the rate at 20% for amounts exceeding Rs. 7 lakhs in a financial year.The Finance Bill, 2024 proposes an extension of the time limit for introducing the faceless scheme by the Central Government for transfer pricing proceedings, DRP Proceedings, and ITAT Proceedings, up to March 31, 2025.The interim Budget 2024 may not have proposed significant tax announcements, but it very well positioned the prelude to the full budget post the upcoming elections. Considering the potential impact on the population across the four pillars of GYAN, a sizable portion of India stands to be covered. The interim Budget’s focus on the tax front resembles a report card, highlighting the maturity achieved by our tax system. The enhancement of taxpayer services was emphasized as a key priority.","This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data and N for Nari utthan.

Interim Budget for a Viksit Bharat: It’s for everyone and all,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/interim-budget-for-a-viksit-bharat-its-for-everyone-and-all/articleshow/107497439.cms,"By Akhilesh Tuteja

The Finance Minister on February 01, 2024, delivered a truly innovative interim budget. At first glance, it did not seem like an interim budget but looked more like the budget to drive further growth and a continuum of inclusive growth-oriented investments.At the outset, this budget brings a wonderful balance between fiscal prudence and continued investment for growth.It's not easy to continue the glide path of reducing the fiscal deficit and continuing to make significant investments in all areas including infrastructure, R&D, energy transition, technology, skilling, and social welfare. The surprising reduction in fiscal deficit of 5.8% as against the budgeted 5.9% for FY24 and the projection of 5.1% in FY25 with a clear focus on increasing investments was a huge positive.This was a budget for everyone and all because it caters to every part of the Indian economy and society. The FM has carefully catered to the investment needs of various sectors. The continued focus on youth, impoverished, women and farmers to increase their involvement and contribution to economic growth is evident. By committing an 11.1% increase in capital expenditure to 11,11,111 lakh crore, the FM has clearly brought every single 1 in this growth journey.What was very impressive was the inclusion strategy of the government. The focus on women's empowerment for the past few years is unprecedented, which is reflected in the inclusion of women in the workforce moving from 23.3% to 37% in the last five years. The thirty crore Mudra Yojna loans to women entrepreneurs were a great boost to the Nari Shakti initiative. We already have over 10 million Lakhpati Didis and what is truly evident is like a corporate CFO, the FM has revised the earlier target of 20 million Lakhpati Didis to 30 million. The government also plans to invest in initiatives to encourage young girls between the ages of 9 and 14 to undertake the vaccination for cervical cancer which is again a great boost to Nari Shakti.A lot needs to be done to bring more women into all parts of economic growth but the journey so far and the vision of the future is truly inspiring.While India continues on its technological prowess and makes its mark in new technologies like Artificial Intelligence, we need a multi-pronged strategy to harness the power of AI. We need a clear focus on building AI systems in India so that we not only emerge as a global leader in this new era but can build models, which are specific to India that will benefit Indians. At the same time, we need a very wide coverage program to build skills to leverage AI to its fullest potential. The biggest contribution we can make to the inclusion of youth in the economic development of the country is by skilling them in new skill areas. In the last few years, the Skill India Mission has trained 14 million youth, reskilled over 5 million youth and established a staggering 3,000 new ITIs. The future of any country will depend as much on capital investments as on skill investments.The focus on agricultural development and support to the farmer continues through direct financial assistance to farmers. The farmers have benefited by getting crop insurance through PM Fasal Bima Yojana. It's not just the farmers, the PM-SVANidhi provides credit assistance to a large number of street vendors.The last few years have seen the journey of affordable housing through Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY). There is a slight increase in allocation to launch a scheme for encouraging the middle class to build or buy new homes. This investment will likely propel a wider economic development and increase employment.India has seen a tremendous rise in entrepreneurship in the last few years. In order to continue the journey and promote new startups, the government proposes to extend certain tax benefits, which are expiring from March 2024 to March 2025. The MSMEs have not been left behind. With a proposal to provide timely finances to such enterprises, the government has paved the way for their growth, so they can look to compete globally.All in all, it’s a truly inclusive budget with a clear focus on development not just by giving away freebies but enabling the people to participate in the economic development activity. While the FM calls the comprehensive GDP - Governance, Development & Performance – to me, this budget is inclusive of another GDP – gender, demography, and professions.","Akhilesh Tuteja is Partner and Head, Clients and Markets, KPMG in India.

‘Enough domestic sources of demand to counter drag from external sector’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/enough-domestic-sources-of-demand-to-counter-drag-from-external-sector/articleshow/107372012.cms,"Do you think the

creates room for lower interest rates?

One of the issues that the Budget has flagged is the demographic challenge and opportunity and the societal change that is taking place. How do you view this?

Niti Aayog is working on the Viksit Bharat roadmap. What will be the focus areas?

You are as much a representative of the Centre as well as the states. Is it time to revisit the entire formula for transfers to states particularly on the issue of cesses and surcharges?

Suman Bery , who heads Niti Aayog , the govt think tank, is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China, which he says is also an opportunity for India. The economist is confident that Indian states remain resilient. Excerpts of the interview with TOI.The finance ministry expects the economy to grow 7% next year.Given the global situation, how do you see the prospects?The belief in the finance ministry is that we have a possible drag coming from the external sector but that we have other sources. We have enough domestic sources of demand. One has to applaud the political and economic judgment of FM in deciding that it was appropriate to pursue the path of fiscal consolidation. There is transparency. What this actually reflects is responsible economic management, which is one reason we are where we are. Second, it also creates a buffer so that there is policy space if we do encounter headwinds.That’s the hope and expectation. We have an independent central bank and an inflation targeting central bank, so it is up to the monetary policy committee to take a call through the monetary policy committee on the repo rate .The PM has said that when India grows its states grow. India is a composite of 37 states and UTs. They are each at very different points in their demographic transition. There are some states where the net replacement rate is down to 1%, like Kerala . There are others, particularly UP and Bihar, which are in their earliest stage of demographic transition and each one of these states is the size of a large European country. There are two implications of that — one is internal labour mobility and it will become an even larger part of our growth model. The govt has taken several steps to create a unified market. Our main endowment is our human capital and that has to be equipped to participate in global exchange in many ways. We know from China, Japan that the demographic dividend partly depends on markets and on human capital. But the golden period is fairly short lived, about 15 years, when the so called dependency ratio declines. The other big opportunity the PM has been highlighting is bringing women much more into the active labour force.When Niti was set up there was the idea of a three-year vision and a seven-year strategy paper. The reality is that schemes of govt tend to be aligned with the award of the Finance Commission . There are various established building blocks or hand holds which are already a matter of govt policy. The PM is much more interested in a national debate on what it means to be a Viksit Bharat or modern society. We have a collective goal and it is for the democratic polity to define what that goal should be. Its emphatically not for a super mandarin bureaucracy. It is not going to be Lee Kwan Yew’s Singapore led from the top.It’s entirely a finance ministry matter but I would be lying if I didn’t say when I visit certain states there is this complaint. A big frontier would be resource mobilisation at the state level. Second is going to be rationalisation of subsidies not only at the Union level, but also at the state level. All chief ministers sit on my governing council. When they convene as the governing council, I see them in their role as development practitioners. The world is beginning to appreciate quite how much institutional and political maturity India attained in our 75 years and the most fundamental dimension of a democracy, we have orderly transfers of power. There are enough buffers to ensure that what happens in state finances is unlikely to create macro instability. Those risks are well contained by our Constitution. The chief ministers know that they are going to be judged by development outcomes and so you can have the sugar rush of changing of pension plans or various handouts but if the cupboard is bare you are not going to be able to deliver.","Suman Bery is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China.

Government's Marathon to 2047: Emphasis on Fiscal Prudence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/governments-marathon-to-2047-emphasis-on-fiscal-prudence/articleshow/107371788.cms,"What was the thinking behind keeping the vote on account absolutely straight?

So is it the idea to keep the Budget completely transparent?

The capex has risen 11.1% and there is an emphasis on infrastructure spending. But there is also the hope that the private sector will now take over and start capital spending. Given the geopolitical situation, how confident is the govt that it will pan out as planned?

Finance secretary T V Somanathan, in an interview with TOI, says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047 . Excerpts:If you see the Budget speech you will see the emphasis on 2047. The govt has set its sight on running that marathon.Running to 2047 is a marathon , it’s not a sprint. If you are going to run a marathon, you need to be in good shape and you can’t have short-term stimulants or something that will get you some yards and then it’s done.The whole focus is on making India a developed country by 2047, for which a healthy present and a strong fiscal position is an important concomitant. Some purely short term measures don’t really fit into that picture. It’s a consistent picture: focus on the long term for which you need to build strength in the short term and that needs to be done by prudence in fiscal policy and by not doing things which can detract you from that path. Not doing the wrong thing is more important than appearing to do things.The idea is that govt finances may be good, bad or indifferent depending on the times, depending on the circumstances, depending on the policies. But what is the position should be reflected as reasonably and accurately as possible. That is an emphasis. As regards the Finance Commission, again the terms of reference that have been given to them are the terms in the Constitution.What is the means by which the devolution should be done is a matter they have full discretion. They can actually take all kinds of factors into account and in a sense we felt this time based on my review of the previous commissions that the right expression would be less is more. The shorter, less prescriptive terms of reference gives full scope for all stakeholders including state govts to express their viewpoints and for the commission to take a balanced view of the different perspectives and then come to its award. Ultimately the award of the Finance Commission is about devolution and grant for which full scope has now been given to them.n There are incipient signs of private capital expenditure accelerating. There are some surveys I have seen done by some of the chambers industry, which show high levels of investment. The PMI, which is a sort of leading indicator, is also looking pretty healthy. Capacity utilisation is one reason that private sector capital expenditure doesn’t immediately pick up when the economy starts accelerating because there is surplus capacity.But increasingly I get the sense that many industries are beginning to reach levels where they have to add capacity. When that happens capital investment will happen. Another pointer also mentioned in the Budget speech you may notice that our airlines have placed large orders for planes — that is capital expenditure.When you import 1,000 aircraft, it’s just not 1,000 aircraft, there are concomitant additions to ground handling facilities, you need airports to expand, you need to employ people to do that. That means a lot of jobs. The aircraft is capital but then look at the effect it is going to have on skilled jobs. So capital expenditure is happening. I am fairly confident that we will have decent capital expenditure in the year to come and that will become a new source of acceleration.",Finance secretary T V Somanathan says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047.

Income Tax Changes Budget 2024 : In the recent Budget 2024 speech, the Finance Minister kept the Section 80C tax deduction limit unchanged. The maximum limit for claiming tax benefits under Section 80C remains at Rs 1.5 lakh for the current fiscal year 2023-24 and will stay the same for individuals looking to save on taxes through Section 80C investments in the upcoming fiscal year 2024-25.Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions. Individuals can reduce their gross taxable income by up to Rs 1.5 lakh per financial year by engaging in these specific investments or expenditures.You can save on taxes through Section 80C by investing in things like Employees' Provident Fund (EPF), Public Provident Fund (PPF), Equity Linked Saving Scheme (ELSS) mutual funds, National Savings Certificate (NSC), and 5-year tax-saving fixed deposits with banks or post offices. Additionally, paying life insurance policy premiums also qualifies for tax benefits under Section 80C.It is important to note that each eligible investment comes with its specific maximum limit, rate of return, liquidity, and taxation rules for the earned returns, states ET in a report. For instance, the most you can invest in PPF in a financial year is Rs 1.5 lakh. Meanwhile, there's no limit on the amount you can invest in ELSS mutual funds, but the Section 80C deduction is capped at Rs 1.5 lakh.If individuals can't make specific investments, they can still get deductions under Section 80C from their gross taxable income through certain expenses. These expenses include repaying the principal amount of a home loan, tuition fees for children, payment of stamp duty, registration fees, and other costs related to buying a house.Since the financial year 2020-21, individuals without any business income must annually choose between the old and new tax regimes. As of the fiscal year 2023-24, the new tax regime is the default option. Consequently, individuals seeking tax deductions under Section 80C must opt for the old tax regime since this deduction isn't available in the new tax regime. It's crucial for taxpayers to be aware of these rules to make informed decisions about their tax planning and investment strategies.","Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget which is an interim budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year. The budget talks about inclusive development both, social and geographical, especially for youth, women, farmers, and the poor. Continued focus on improving logistics through infrastructure spend on roads, rail, airports, ports increases productivity for companies and citizens alike.To make ‘Viksit Bharat’ by 2047, the government’s focus is on improving and empowering people’s capabilities through various skilling initiatives. It is encouraging to see that Skill India Mission has succeeded in training more than 1.4 crore youth and upskilling and reskilling 54 lakh youth. I am particularly happy to see the continued focus on youth and women entrepreneurship and the announcement of a new fund which will give interest free 50 year loans for startups will provide a domestic fillip to startups supplementing venture capital we have traditionally relied on from abroad.PM Mudra Yojana has sanctioned 43 crore loans aggregating to 22.5 lakh crore to youth entrepreneurs and thirty crore Mudra Yojana loans to women entrepreneurs. There are several other schemes like Fund of Funds, Start-Up India, and Start-Up Credit Guarantee schemes that are assisting our youth. Further, the extension of tax benefits to Start-ups and investments made by sovereign wealth funds/pension funds, till 31st March 2025 depicts the government’s effort to support the startup eco- system.This aligns quite well with India Sanitation Coalition’s efforts to give impetus to the start-up world. Over the past 7 editions of our ISC-FICCI Sanitation Awards, we have recognized and promoted several start-ups in the sanitation space, many of whom are successful businesses now!While the finance minister did not provide detailed information on Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH), the budget allocation sees a slight increase in spend demonstrating continued focus on this highly successful program. The acknowledgement that the private sector has increasingly played a substantial role in addressing WASH issues in both urban and rural areas, with numerous projects underway through Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs), highlights the government's commitment to addressing challenges in this sector.A perfect example is the LightHouse Initiative initiated by the Department of Drinking Water along with the India Sanitation Coalition (ISC) by partnering with major corporates across India to develop model villages in Solid and Liquid Waste Management (SLWM) under SBM-Grameen. From this budget, there is an expectation that the government will persist in prioritizing Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) as the path toward achieving the country's Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6). Additionally, it is hoped that the government will uphold its commitment to making necessary infrastructural investments for SLWM.The budget speech rightly celebrates the fact that we have 83 lakh SHGs and 9 crore women beneficiaries. The microfinance movement in the country and the possibility of empowering women members of SHGs through livelihood skilling is a key to bringing women into mainstream economic advancement.The focus on green growth, rooftop solar, wind, biomass, e-vehicles all help with our green energy thrust. The tourism sector was mentioned and could be a huge job provider for youth and women.Guided by the principle ‘Reform, Perform, and Transform’, the budget emphasizes efficient implementation of various policies by improving coordination with states and relevant stakeholders. This is critical both for infra spend and social programsIt is noteworthy that ISC’s Climate Resilient Coastal Cities project which is being implemented in PPP (Public-Private Partnership) mode in four coastal states of Karnataka, Gujarat, Goa and Maharashtra is congruent with the government’s priority of promoting climate-resilient activities for the blue economy 2.0, a scheme for restoration and adaptation measures, and coastal aquaculture.The budget also focuses on the Aspirational districts program where assistance will be given to the states for faster development of aspirational districts and blocks, including the generation of ample economic opportunities. This is again very crucial as it has a huge potential to transform the landscape of our country while making sure no -one is left behind.Overall, this budget has embraced economic strategies and develops the building blocks that nurture and uphold growth, promote inclusive and sustainable development, and enhance productivity.","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year.

Three engineers at Zoho talk about their work and how techies, especially women, should look at their life and careerI joined Zoho in 2001 as a greenhorn. Initially, I was reserved with low expectations. However, hard work, innate curiosity, and my willingness to challenge assumptions opened new paths for me and helped me grow. I have been fortunate to work on a diverse array of complex projects, including co-designing Deluge (Zoho’s proprietary programming language), and architecting products like Zoho CRM platform from scratch.To all women out there, I encourage you to stay curious, work hard, be there for your family, and enjoy the small wins – the first code you ship, the first customer, the first idea that you stand your ground for. Concentrate on your own progress, hold onto your faith, and do not compare yourselves with men or other women. I would offer the same advice to men.Working in the security domain, no two days are the same. I love the challenge of building a security program to fit our organisation’s culture and engineering and scaling our security tools and processes as the business evolves. Being in the thick of a security incident and driving the incident response process successfully is an exciting adrenaline rush every time. As technologists, it’s important to take ownership of your career path. That means expressing yourself clearly and being an advocate for your own interests. Allocate time to building on your interests, both on the professional and personal front. Learn the next new technology, do a course to expand your domain expertise, travel, engage in hobbies. This gives you the energy and focus to tackle the bigger challenges.My passion for mathematics and problem solving made me choose computer science engineering, and fresh out of college, I started my career at Zoho in 1999 as a software engineer. Assumptions and unawareness were some of the most significant challenges I had to deal with. There have been times when I’ve been underestimated, and even overprotected. Thankfully, the culture at Zoho is to have an open conversation to decide based on one’s strengths and bandwidth. To thrive in tech, it’s crucial to get your basics right by consistently updating your skills. Learning and unlearning can happen in many forms, so it’s important to keep an open mind and remember that the next generation is more intelligent. Asking for help from your peers, leads, and subordinates can benefit you more than you think it can.","Three engineers at Zoho talk about their work and how techies, especially women, should look at their life and career.

What India is doing to build chip manufacturing talent,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/what-india-is-doing-to-build-chip-manufacturing-talent/articleshow/109932104.cms,"Semiconductor serial entrepreneur Dasaradha Gude recalls that when he set up India’s first chip design company Qualcore in the early 1990s, there was barely any skilled semiconductor talent available in India. “We had to train people,” he says. Today, India has one of the biggest semiconductor design bases in the world.Semiconductor manufacturing talent in India today is where design talent was in the early 1990s – barely any.Micron is setting up a massive ATMP (assembly, test, marking and packaging) unit in Gujarat. The Tatas, CG Power (part of Murugappa Group) and smaller companies like Kaynes are planning OSATs (outsourced semiconductor assembly and test). The Tatas are planning a multi-billion dollar wafer fab. All of this will require manufacturing talent. And initiatives around it are slowly taking off.Gude says while the complexity of manufacturing chips required in fabs is very high and not enough talent is available, the country has some talent in the 0-15 years’ experience range for ATMP/ OSAT operations. “The current talent pool that we use for chip design can be reskilled quickly to cater to OSAT operations as the number of jobs that each such unit would require would be in the range of 200-1,000 people,” says Gude.Much of the requirement for talent will be for diploma holders – from institutions like the ITIs – in areas like electricals, electronics & communication. Industry veteran Satya Gupta believes 90% of the requirement will be for technicians, but Bhanupriya Krishna, MD of training firm Perceptives Solutions, thinks this will be about 60%. The rest of the talent will be BTechs, MTechs and PhDs. Top-level talent will initially need to come from countries with foundry and ATMP experience. For the rest, several efforts are on, including new curriculum, and centres of excellence with world-class training equipment in universities (see adjoining quotes).","India has one of the biggest semiconductor design bases in the world.

Neha Kar wanted to be seen and heard,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/neha-kar-wanted-to-be-seen-and-heard/articleshow/109931896.cms,"Scrum master Neha Kar dreamt big even when she was a girl. Her’s was a conservative family , where girls had to stay indoors. Though she was sent to college, her family did not encourage her to take up a job outside Jabalpur, the town she grew up in. “Girls at the time were not even allowed to go to the balcony.Families thought it would be unsafe. As for my mother, she had to multitask if she wanted to keep her job.Family had to be put before her career. I had numerous fights with her, telling her I wanted my life to be different,” Neha recalls.After a degree in computer science, Neha did Master’s in computer science from BITS Pilani. While in Pilani, Wipro had a recruitment drive in Delhi for jobs in Bengaluru. Though her family did not approve of her going to Delhi alone, Neha went.She got an offer from Wipro and told her parents she’s moving to Bengaluru. The parents’ condition was that Neha would report every week to an uncle and aunt of hers in the city.From Monday to Friday, she would work, and during the weekends, she studied to complete her Master’s courses.After a few years at Wipro, she switched to Fidelity Investments as a lead software engineer. Here, she also met the person who would become her husband. After nine years at Fidelity, she quit to take care of her twin daughters. The day she was going to submit her resignation, she met with an accident. Her girls were just seven months old. Neha required surgery. It took eight months to get back on her feet.But more than the surgery, Neha was hurt that she was in the same situation as her mother – slogging for the family and not having an identity of her own.“One day my husband saw how exhausted I was with all the work around me, and asked me to go for a walk. I told him that there was no time to relax. It then hit me that my mother had the same excuse when I would ask her to take it easy. I could not bear to become like her. That simply meant, I had to get back into the workforce,” Neha says.Her relatives didn’t like the idea. One of them said her husband was earning enough for the family.But Neha was determined. Her friends helped her prepare by taking mock interviews. Still, rejection followed rejection at job interviews.“I was good at my role at Fidelity. But technology had moved on. I had a lot of catching up to do,” she says.Fortunately for Neha, Fidelity itself had a role for her, and since she had proven herself previously at the company, they didn’t hesitate to take her back.Before quitting, she had worked on Oracle Database and Oracle PL SQL. When she returned, most of the work was in Hadoop SQL, and Python was the coding language. Neha spent three months shadowing her colleagues to acquire new skills.Many in office felt she wouldn’t take up night shifts and travel to other cities for work. So, she had to prove herself all over again to get good work. “I think of work as my passion, and that’s helped me move up the ladder.”","Neha Kar grew up in a conservative family in Jabalpur, Uttar Pradesh.

Tech solutions are slowly making the world more sustainable,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tech-solutions-are-slowly-making-the-world-more-sustainable/articleshow/109931812.cms,"Simple tech solutions

Our insatiable desires have left an indelible mark on Earth, by some estimates the Anthropocene – a common name used to describe the geological epoch during which humans have had a substantial impact on our planet – started after World War 2, and we are now fast approaching the point of no return (thanks to growing CO2 levels). As easy as it is to be morose and pessimistic about the position humanity finds itself in, there are plenty of engineers tinkering with potential solutions to the ecological catastrophes that threaten to engulf us.And considering the millions of engineers that India is home to, it should come as no surprise that Indian engineers , working for both MNCs and local companies, are consistently coming up with practical sustainable solutions for a wide variety of industries and sectors.One such solution was developed by Boeing’s development centre in India. Called the Jeppesen FliteDeck Advisor, the application provides real-time, in-flight, tailspecific speed advisories to reduce fuel burn, and increase mission range and duration, says Venkatesh Ramachandra, director of Boeing Digital Aviation Solutions India (BDASI). It supports pilots by providing speed advisories to optimise their operations and fuel efficiency, helping reduce cruise fuel burn by 1.5-2%.A team of aerospace engineers, data engineers, data scientists, software developers, and project managers from the Boeing India Engineering & Technology Centre collaborated with the Boeing US team to develop this application, says Venkatesh.E-commerce is another area where any incremental change in sustainability metrics has a substantial impact downstream due to the volumes involved. Chirag Taneja, CEO & co-founder of GoKwik, says that while he started dealing closely with e-commerce brands, the issue of orders being returned before delivery was brought to his attention.“This problem not only impacts a brand’s bottom line but also creates immense pressure on the environment,” he says.So GoKwik decided to leverage data science and tech-backed capabilities to address the issue. “We built an intelligence framework that analyses past shopper behaviour patterns, ranks them under the cohorts of riskiness and places risk-based interventions with an aim to significantly reduce the likelihood of returns right at the time of checkout.”The result, he says, has not just been a marked decrease in double trips and concomitant fuel consumption, but it also cuts down on packaging waste, which relieves pressure on our landfills.The construction industry is another major contributor of greenhouse gases. The production and use of materials such as cement, for example, has a significant carbon footprint. L&T, a major player in the sector, implemented a novel recycling technique to cut down on the use of such materials.“While making highways, certain projects require rehabilitation of existing roads. The typical recycling process is hot recycling of the asphalt layer, but it requires a significant amount of energy. The improved version of recycling is cold central plant recycling (CCPR), which not only reduces the amount of virgin material consumed but also significantly lowers energy consumption,” says Pradeep Panigrahi, head of ESG at L&T.Pradeep says his team at L&T implemented CCPR for the Meerut-Aligarh-Ghaziabad road project and plan to replicate it in similar project sites.“The technology helped avoid usage of two million tonnes of virgin material (aggregates), it also helped avoid a total of 12,444 tCO2e, which is equivalent to planting 1.5 lakhs trees.”A lot of the time you don’t need to build sophisticated tech platforms to make a meaningful difference in our world. Take the case of Abhay Deshpande, founder & CEO of Recykal. Abhay wanted to find a solution to the perennial problem of plastic bottles being littered across the picturesque Himalayas. The solution he came up with was to induce a behavioural change towards responsible waste management.","Indian engineers are consistently coming up with practical sustainable solutions.

'Financial guru forecasts massive stock market correction in US',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/financial-guru-forecasts-massive-stock-market-correction-in-us/articleshow/109919191.cms,"NEW DELHI: Grant Cardone , a seasoned private equity fund manager, has issued a stark warning about an imminent stock market crash that could see values halve, potentially wiping out the retirement and savings of millions of Americans. The Dow Jones' recent gains notwithstanding, Cardone highlighted the alarming trend in the S&P's yield curve, which has been inverted for over 500 days—a historical precursor to significant market downturns including those in 1929, 1974, and 2009.In a recent statement on the social media platform X, Cardone outlined the dire consequences of such a crash, compounded by current inflation rates, which could effectively amplify total losses to feel more like 75%.""WARNING: Stock Market is due for 50 percent correction taking S&P below 2674,"" he cautioned, emphasizing the risk to retirement accounts heavily invested in the stock market at these levels, a Daily Mail report said.Cardone, who has advised companies such as Google and Morgan Stanley, drew parallels between the current market indicators and those that preceded major financial crises in the past. He explained that following the historical crashes, the market declines erased significant value from Americans' 401Ks, affecting their long-term savings and financial security.The financial expert also criticized the Federal Reserve's recent rate hikes, arguing that they have stifled the housing market rather than controlling inflation as intended. ""Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has not controlled inflation. He has failed miserably,"" Cardone said. He suggests that reducing interest rates might rejuvenate the housing market, encouraging more sales and potentially lowering house prices.To safeguard against potential financial turmoil, Cardone recommends transitioning retirement funds from stock market-dependent 401ks to real assets that generate consistent cash flow, such as property investments. He believes this strategy could provide retirees with a more stable and reliable income source.This warning comes as Manhattan sees a drop in rents for the first time since the pandemic, signaling potential shifts in the real estate market that could offer investment opportunities amid economic uncertainties.","Grant Cardone, a seasoned private equity fund manager, has issued a stark warning about an imminent stock market crash that could see values halve.

"SIA Group orders SAF, offers flyers option to cut their CO2 footprint",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/sia-group-orders-saf-offers-flyers-option-to-cut-their-co2-footprint/articleshow/109917309.cms,"MUMBAI: Singapore Airlines and Scoot of Singapore Airlines ( SIA ) Group have become the first airlines operating out of Singapore-Changi airport to receive Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) produced in Neste ’s refinery in Singapore. Both the airlines will offer corporate flyers, shippers, cargo companies the option to buy offsets to claim environmental benefits.Starting from May 2024, the SIA Group airlines will offer 1,000 SAF `Book & Claim Units’ (BCUs) for purchase by its corporate travellers, shippers, and freight forwarders, the airline said. “Each BCU represents one tonne of neat SAF with its associated carbon dioxide reduction benefit. Purchasing SAF BCUs allows corporate travellers, shippers, and freight forwarders to claim the associated environmental benefits for flights related to their business travel and operations, validating the demand for SAF BCUs and supporting the development of the nascent SAF industry,” it added. The Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB) Book & Claim system, a trusted industry standard, ensures the traceability and credibility of these transactions, it said. “RSB is a global membership organisation that drives the sustainable transition to a bio-based and circular economy. The Book & Claim system enables the decoupling of sustainability attributes from certified SAF. The decoupled sustainability attributes can be used to generate SAF Book & Claim Units (BCUs), which can be transferred to another account holder and retired in a robust and transparent manner,” said SIA.The SIA Group agreement with Neste involves the purchase of 1,000 tonnes of SAF, produced at Neste’s refinery at Singapore Changi Airport . Neste will blend the SAF with conventional jet fuel and deliver the blended jet fuel directly to Changi Airport’s fuel hydrant system in two batches – once in the second quarter of 2024 and once in the fourth quarter of this year, SIA said in a press statement. The said SAF blended fuel will meet the safety specifications of the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), an international standard for conventional jet fuel quality, it added. Blended with conventional jet fuel, it seamlessly integrates with existing aircraft engines and fuelling infrastructure, it added.“This milestone will also mark the first direct supply of Neste’s SAF to airlines at Changi Airport, reinforcing their end-to-end SAF supply chain capabilities in Singapore. This follows the completion of the expansion of Neste’s Singapore refinery in May 2023. The refinery has the capacity to produce a million tonnes of SAF each year, making it the world’s largest SAF production facility,” it said.“Neste’s SAF, which is made from 100% renewable waste and residue raw materials, reduces greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% over the fuel’s life cycle,” said SIA. The 80% reductionof lifecycle carbon emissions is when SAF is used in neat (unblended) form and when the emissions are calculated with established life cycle assessment (LCA) methodologies, such as the CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) methodology. The said calculation includes both production and transport emissions.Alexander Kueper, Vice President Renewable Aviation, Neste, said: “We are proud that Singapore Airlines and Scoot are our first customers benefiting from our integrated supply capabilities into Changi Airport. This supply of locally produced SAF to Changi Airport is a milestone in our journey of supporting the aviation industry and governments in the region to achieve their emissions reduction goals. Singapore is a leading aviation hub in the Asia-Pacific region and this delivery of SAF, as well as the recently announced national SAF target, will hopefully encourage the wider adoption of SAF across the broader Asia-Pacific region. We are looking forward to expanding our cooperation with Singapore Airlines as well as supplying visiting carriers at Changi Airport.”Lee Wen Fen, Chief Sustainability Officer, Singapore Airlines, said: “This agreement with Neste is an important milestone in the SIA Group’s journey to have a minimum of 5% sustainable aviation fuel in our total fuel uplift by 2030. Close collaboration with our partners and stakeholders, both in Singapore and globally, plays a critical role in our long-term decarbonisation goals. A more sustainable aviation industry will ensure that future generations continue to benefit from the global connectivity, economic prosperity, and people links that air travel fosters.”","Singapore Airlines and Scoot of Singapore Airlines ( SIA ) Group have become the first airlines operating out of Singapore-Changi airport to receive Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) The SIA Group agreement with Neste involves the purchase of 1,000 tonnes of SAF.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109919380,imgsize-873301,width-400,resizemode-4/109919380.jpg"

Warren Buffett says AI may be better for scammers than society. And he's seen how,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/warren-buffett-says-ai-may-be-better-for-scammers-than-society-and-hes-seen-how/articleshow/109857585.cms,"OMAHA: Warren Buffett cautioned the tens of thousands of shareholders who packed an arena for his annual meeting that artificial intelligence scams could become ""the growth industry of all time.""Doubling down on his cautionary words from last year, Buffett told the throngs he recently came face to face with the downside of AI. And it looked and sounded just like him.Someone made a fake video of Buffett, apparently convincing enough that the so-called Oracle of Omaha himself said he could imagine it tricking him into sending money overseas.The billionaire investing guru predicted scammers will seize on the technology, and may do more harm with it than society can wring good.""As someone who doesn't understand a damn thing about it, it has enormous potential for good and enormous potential for harm and I just don't know how that plays out,"" he said.EARNINGS BEFORE MUSINGSThe day started early Saturday with Berkshire Hathaway announcing a steep drop in earnings as the paper value of its investments plummeted and it pared its Apple holdings. The company reported a $12.7 billion profit, or $8,825 per Class A share, in first the quarter, down 64% from $35.5 billion, or $24,377 per A share a year ago.But Buffett encourages investors to pay more attention to the conglomerate's operating earnings from the companies it actually owns. Those jumped 39% to $11.222 billion, or $7,796.47 per Class A share, led by insurance companies' performance.None of it that got in the way of the fun.Throngs flooded the arena to buy up Squishmallows of Buffett and former Vice Chairman Charlie Munger , who died last fall. The event attracts investors from all over the world and is unlike any other company meeting. Those attending for the first time are driven by an urgency to get here while the 93-year-old Buffett is still alive.""This is one of the best events in the world to learn about investing. To learn from the gods of the industry,"" said Akshay Bhansali, who spent the better part of two days traveling from India to Omaha.A NOTABLE ABSENCEDevotees come from all over the world to vacuum up tidbits of wisdom from Buffett, who famously dubbed the meeting 'Woodstock for Capitalists.'But a key ingredient was missing this year: It was the first meeting since Munger died.The meeting opened with a video tribute highlighting some of his best known quotes, including classic lines like ""If people weren't so often wrong, we wouldn't be so rich."" The video also featured skits the investors made with Hollywood stars over the years, including a ""Desperate Housewives"" spoof where one of the women introduced Munger as her boyfriend and another in which actress Jaimie Lee Curtis swooned over him.As the video ended, the arena erupted in a prolonged standing ovation honoring Munger, whom Buffett called ""the architect of Berkshire Hathaway.""Buffett said Munger remained curious about the world up until the end of his life at 99, hosting dinner parties, meeting with people and holding regular Zoom calls.""Like his hero Ben Franklin, Charlie wanted to understand everything,"" Buffett said.For decades, Munger and Buffett functioned as a classic comedy duo, with Buffett offering lengthy setups to Munger's witty one-liners. He once referred to unproven internet companies as ""turds.""Together, the pair transformed Berkshire from a floundering textile mill into a massive conglomerate made up of a variety of interests, from insurance companies such as Geico to BNSF railroad to several major utilities and an assortment of other companies.Munger often summed up the key to Berkshire's success as ""trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very intelligent."" He and Buffett also were known for sticking to businesses they understood well.""Warren always did at least 80% of the talking. But Charlie was a great foil,"" said Stansberry Research analyst Whitney Tilson, who was looking forward to his 27th consecutive meeting.NEXT GEN LEADERSMunger's absence, however, created space for shareholders to get to know better the two executives who directly oversee Berkshire's companies: Ajit Jain, who manages the insurance units; and Abel, who handles everything else and has been named Buffett's successor. The two shared the main stage with Buffett this year.The first time Buffett kicked a question to Abel, he mistakenly said ""Charlie?"" Abel shrugged off the mistake and dove into the challenges utilities face from the increased risk of wildfires and some regulators' reluctance to let them collect a reasonable profit.Morningstar analyst Greggory Warren said he believes Abel spoke up more Saturday and let shareholders see some of the brilliance Berkshire executives talk about.Abel offered a twist on Munger's classic ""I have nothing to add"" line by often starting his answers Saturday by saying ""The only thing I would add.""""Greg's a rock star,"" said Chris Bloomstran, president of Semper Augustus Investments Group. ""The bench is deep. He won't have the same humor at the meeting. But I think we all come here to get a reminder every year to be rational.""A LOOK TO THE FUTUREBuffett has made clear that Abel will be Berkshire's next CEO, but he said Saturday that he had changed his opinion on how the company's investment portfolio should be handled. He had previously said it would fall to two investment managers who handle small chunks of the portfolio now. On Saturday, Buffett endorsed Abel for the gig, as well as overseeing the operating businesses and any acquisitions.""He understands businesses extremely well. and if you understand businesses, you understand common stocks,"" Buffett said. Ultimately, it will be up to the board to decide, but the billionaire said he might come back and haunt them if they try to do it differently.Overall, Buffett said Berkshire's system of having all the noninsurance companies report to Abel and the insurers report to Jain is working well. He himself hardly gets any calls from managers anymore because they get more guidance from Abel and Jain.""This place would work extremely well the next day if something happened to me,"" Buffett said.Nevertheless, the best applause line of the day was Buffett's closing remark: ""I not only hope that you come next year but I hope that I come next year.""","Buffett: AI has ""enormous potential for good and enormous potential for harm"" Berkshire Hathaway announces a steep drop in earnings as the paper value of its investments plummeted. The company reported a $12.7 billion profit, or $8,825 per Class A share.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109857888,imgsize-1382165,width-400,resizemode-4/109857888.jpg"

Worsening weather is igniting a $25 billion market,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/worsening-weather-is-igniting-a-25bn-market/articleshow/109851979.cms,"Marty Malinow's mom never could get her head around what her son did for a living. To friends, she said he was ""a stockbroker that does something with the weather."" Malinow couldn't really object - he knew most people had no clue about financial contracts based on things like rainfall and wind.That's beginning to change. Against a backdrop of rising climate volatility and social shifts, demand for weather derivatives is surging.Average trading volumes for listed products jumped more than 260% in 2023, according to the CME Group , with the number of outstanding contracts currently 48% higher than a year ago. And that publicly traded corner could make up as little as 10% of all activity, according to industry estimates; outstanding derivatives may be worth as much as $25 billion based on notional value.""There's a lot more trajectory to our business right now,"" says Malinow, the founder and chief executive officer of advisory firm Parameter Climate. ""The heightened fragility from direct weather volatility, supply-chain issues, inflation, geopolitics. It means weather can eat up a bigger part of the bottom line now.""Wall Street's better-known weather bets, catastrophe bonds, are also riding high following a year of bumper returns. But this boom is playing out in derivatives, which provide a different kind of hedge: Protection from less severe but more common meteorological threats. While a cat bond may pay out if a 100-year storm tears through a community, a weather derivative can compensate a tourism business if there are too many rainy days, or a farmer if a hot summer stresses her crops.Part of the jump in demand is driven by corporations newly confronting their exposure to the elements. In some cases, it's because their operations have already been impacted, in others because they're responding to investor and consumer pressures. In many jurisdictions, regulators are beginning to compel firms to quantify how much of a threat the weather is to their business. Most large and listed European firms are required to disclose what they see as risks and opportunities from environmental factors.",Average trading volumes for listed products jumped more than 260% in 2023.
