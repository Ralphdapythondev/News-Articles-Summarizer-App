"LIC mulls entering health insurance, explores acquisition opportunities",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/lic-mulls-entering-health-insurance-explores-acquisition-opportunities/articleshow/110476146.cms,"LIC's health insurance foray expected to boost coverage

MUMBAI: State-run Life Insurance Corporation is considering entering the health insurance segment and is exploring acquisition opportunities . The move comes amid a proposal to allow composite insurance companies in the sector.""There is an expectation that composite licences may be permitted by the new govt, and we have done some internal groundwork. While we lack expertise in general insurance, we are interested in health insurance and are also considering opportunities for inorganic growth,"" said LIC chairman Siddhartha Mohanty. In Feb 2024, a parliamentary panel had suggested introducing composite insurance licenses to reduce costs and compliance burden for insurers. Currently, life companies can only offer long-term benefit covers under health insurance. For life companies to provide hospitalisation and indemnity cover, an amendment to the Insurance Act would be required.India is a highly under-penetrated insurance market and at the end of 2022-23, less than 2.3 crore health insurance covers were issued, covering 55 crore lives. Of this nearly 30 crore were covered by govt-sponsored business, while almost 20 crore were insured through group insurance. Govt and regulator are keen that more health covers are issued and LIC's entry into the space is expected to spur that. Irdai data showed that during FY23, life insurers issued under 2.9 lakh new policies covering almost 3 lakh lives.Mohanty's remarks on Monday came while announcing LIC's financial results for FY24. LIC reported a net profit of Rs 13,762 crore for the quarter ending March 2024, slightly higher than Rs 13,427 crore in the corresponding quarter of the previous year. Profits were impacted by a provision for wage revision, and lower margins were attributed to higher group business.During the last fiscal year, the insurance behemoth reported an 11% increase in profit after tax (PAT) to Rs 40,676 crore.LIC has recommended a final dividend of Rs 6 per share for the financial year 2023-24, subject to shareholder approval. Additionally, an interim dividend of Rs 4 per share was declared and paid during the year, bringing the total interim and recommended final dividend to Rs 10 per share.""During the last year, we focused on making directional changes in our product mix and enhancing margins in the business. We have more than doubled our share of non-par business within our Individual business. Now, we intend to focus our strategic interventions to maximize our market share across categories,"" Mohanty said.","State-run Life Insurance Corporation is considering entering the health insurance segment.

How RBI’s record Rs 2.1 lakh crore dividend payout to government may help improve India’s credit rating,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/how-rbis-record-rs-2-1-lakh-crore-dividend-payout-to-government-may-help-improve-indias-credit-rating/articleshow/110425577.cms,"The record Rs 2.1 lakh crore dividend that the government will receive from the Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) is a positive development, as it is nearly double the amount budgeted from all financial institutions combined.Several factors could have contributed to the record profit, including the significant increase in interest rates in the United States, where the RBI invests a substantial portion of its $644 billion foreign exchange reserves (Rs 54 lakh crore), says says a TOI analysis by Mayur Shetty.Additionally, the RBI has been actively buying and selling dollars this year compared to the previous year, as foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have been selling equities. Furthermore, the RBI's money market operations have played a role in its earnings. To combat inflation, the RBI has maintained liquidity in a deficit mode, providing opportunities to lend to banks.RBI serves as both a regulatory body and a monetary authority, responsible for managing the money supply and overseeing foreign exchange markets. To stabilize the rupee against speculative inflows, RBI accumulates foreign currency reserves.Also Read | Explained: How RBI managed to give the highest ever Rs 2.1 lakh crore dividend payout to government During challenging times, such as the global financial crisis or the pandemic, central banks expanded their balance sheets through quantitative easing, which involves injecting money into the economy by purchasing bonds from banks.As a result, RBI earns profits from interest on domestic and foreign bonds, as well as from market operations. In its forex operations, RBI sells dollars it purchased during times of surplus when there is a scarcity, making a substantial profit as these sales are at prevailing market prices.However, generating profits is not the primary goal for RBI. The surpluses are a byproduct of RBI working towards its objectives of maintaining financial and market stability.It is often observed that RBI generates more profits during difficult times because it is during crises that the central bank's intervention in forex and money markets intensifies.Also Read | Why RBI is stocking up aggressively on gold reserves; central bank buys 1.5 times more gold in Jan-April than entire 2023 Profit cannot be an objective for the central bank in its market operations, as RBI is the biggest insider in the market.While the RBI can create money, the dividends it pays to the government come from its actual earnings. A significant portion of these earnings is derived from higher interest income on foreign securities and profits from selling foreign exchange. This record surplus could aid India in improving its credit rating , the TOI analysis says.According to S&P, this additional amount is approximately 0.35% of the GDP. Assuming all other factors remain constant, this windfall would reduce the fiscal deficit by that percentage. S&P has indicated that if the government uses the funds to reduce its deficit (by reducing borrowing), it would increase the likelihood of a ratings upgrade.An upgrade would enhance India's standing among global investors, which is a positive sign for markets as it would attract capital inflows. Alternatively, if the government decides to use the windfall to stimulate the economy or provide relief to the poor, it would also be beneficial, as it would boost consumption.The bond market is rallying due to record revenues generated through dividends and the Goods and Services Tax (GST), leading markets to anticipate a significant decrease in government borrowing. When the government borrows less, more funds become available for corporate borrowers, causing interest rates to decline. As interest rates fall, existing bonds that offer higher rates are sold at a premium.","The record Rs 2.1 lakh crore dividend that the government will receive from the Reserve Bank of India is a positive development, as it is nearly double the amount budgeted from all financial institutions combined. Several factors could have contributed to the record profit, including the significant increase in interest rates in the United States.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110435441,imgsize-1225804,width-400,resizemode-4/110435441.jpg"

Salesforce India ups hiring for new AI roles,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/salesforce-india-ups-hiring-for-new-ai-roles/articleshow/110514501.cms,"BENGALURU: New AI jobs require new skills and on-the-job learning.According to Nathalie Scardino, chief people officer in Salesforce, the company is increasingly hiring for positions such as prompt engineers , AI trainers , and ethical AI architects. ""AI is fuelling job creation. While traditional roles will continue to evolve, AI is also creating a myriad of new high-paying, in demand roles across industries - including at Salesforce. We're hiring for jobs today that didn't exist as recently as last year. For instance, the ethical AI architect is really sitting with our product teams to think objectively about how bias could show up within AI,"" she said. Scardino highlighted that the chief AI officer is the newest role in the C-suite responsible for setting the overall AI strategy for an organisation.Prompt engineers, for instance, write prompts for AI tools, like a GPT product or chatbot, to get the most accurate or desired results. An AI trainer works with extensive data sets to train chatbots to respond to user inputs in a more human-like manner. AI architects, on the other hand, are responsible for developing applications that adhere to the responsible use of AI and operate within a governance framework. A recent IDC white paper sponsored by Salesforce expects a sharp increase in hiring for data architects, AI ethicists, and AI solutions architects, over the next 12 months. The report also forecasts the creation of 11.6 million new jobs within the Salesforce ecosystem alone over the next six years.Salesforce has revamped its hiring process to focus on skills and core competencies. ""We're matching potential candidates to roles based on leads through our recruiting events, career website, social channels and more - regardless of whether they've formally applied. We receive over 2 million applicants a year, so it has helped ensure we don't miss out on top talent.

However, a victory exceeding 303 seats — the party’s count in the 2019 polls — may result in gains of about 3% in the benchmark stock gauge, the survey showed.Winning by a landslide would give Modi the mandate needed to push through politically difficult reforms in land acquisition and labor that are seen as crucial for accelerating India’s economic growth. While investors still back Modi to win a third term, low voter turnout and reports of close contests in some areas have tempered their enthusiasm about his expected victory margin since elections began on April 19.“If he were not to win, that would create some uncertainty and put some pressure on valuation,” Henry Mallari-D’Auria, chief investment officer for global and emerging markets at Ariel Investments LLC, said in an interview. “At this time, there is little uncertainty about the outcome of this election.”Indian equities have risen to records, while the currency and bond markets are near their highest levels in over two months days ahead of the election results on June 4.Predictably, volatility has spiked in both the stock and rupee markets. The gauge of 30-day implied volatility on the National Stock Exchange Ltd has more than doubled from a low in April, while the same in the one-month part of the dollar-rupee options curve has steadily risen since the election began.Meanwhile, global funds have pulled $2.9 billion from local shares this month. Indian equities have trailed peers in Asia this year as rich valuations of about 20 times 12-month forward earnings and elections jitters deter foreign investors.Still, some participants foresee stock benchmarks rallying at least 20% should Modi fulfill his promise of his party and its allies winning more than 400 seats.JM Financial Ltd, Emkay Investment Managers Ltd and UBS Group AG expect the ruling alliance to win more than 300 seats. That said, UBS in a report last week warned that a change in government could see Indian equities “test pre-Modi” valuation of about 15 times one-year forward earnings.“The robust economic momentum combined with a larger global trade footprint by the PM suggest that on balance - a bigger majority versus elections five years ago,” said George Boubouras, managing director at K2 Asset Management Ltd. The Melbourne-based asset manager anticipates a “double-digit positive rally if BJP wins more than 400 seats.”","A smaller majority for the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party may lead to a drop of about 2% in the NSE Nifty 50 Index.

Tax collection at source:

Extension of Faceless Scheme time limit:

(Ravi Jain is Partner, Vialto Partners. Vikas Narang, Director and Pawan Digga, Manager at Vialto Partners contributed to the article. Views are personal)

The finance minister set the stage for a ""Viksit Bharat by 2047"", on the core principles of ‘Sabka Saath’, ‘Sabka Vikas’, ‘Sabka Vishwas’, with ‘Sabka Prayas’ being added as a new theme in the interim Budget.This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data i.e., farmer welfare and N for Nari utthan i.e., support for women entrepreneurs.These form the pillars of a comprehensive inclusive development. The Government's commitment to sustainable development under the strategy for Amrit Kaal includes achieving 'Net Zero' by 2070, rooftop solarization for one crore households and robust health initiatives.The Indian economy's resilience takes center stage amidst positive indicators of declining current account deficit as a percentage of GDP, falling unemployment rates, and a notable rise in digital transactions. These statistics affirm the robustness of the economy, showcasing a trajectory of growth and stability.The achievements in taxation reforms are nothing short of remarkable, with direct tax collections more than trebling in the last decade, the number of tax return filers increasing by 2.4 times, average processing time of tax returns plummeting from 93 days in FY 2013-14 to an impressive 10 days in FY 2023-24, resulting in issuance of quick refunds. These are the results of consistent progressive measures thus obviating the need for, and rightly avoiding, any last-minute populist measures.No change in existing tax rates, both for direct and indirect taxes, is a good indicator of stability and predictability for investors and taxpayers.A welcome move to waive outstanding tax demands that are minor, disputed, and unreconciled. This involves the withdrawal of outstanding direct tax demands up to Rs. 25,000 pertaining to the period up to FY 2009-10 and up to Rs.10,000 for FY 2010-11 to 2014-15.The Government's commitment to fostering a business-friendly environment is evident in its intent to extend specific tax benefits for start-ups, investments by sovereign wealth funds/ pension funds, and certain IFSC units. The extension has been made now until March 31, 2025. This might help in creating a conducive landscape for business.To align with the CBDT notification issued earlier, the provisions relating to tax collection at source concerning remittances under the Liberalized Remittance Scheme have now been formally incorporated in the Finance Bill, 2024, setting the rate at 20% for amounts exceeding Rs. 7 lakhs in a financial year.The Finance Bill, 2024 proposes an extension of the time limit for introducing the faceless scheme by the Central Government for transfer pricing proceedings, DRP Proceedings, and ITAT Proceedings, up to March 31, 2025.The interim Budget 2024 may not have proposed significant tax announcements, but it very well positioned the prelude to the full budget post the upcoming elections. Considering the potential impact on the population across the four pillars of GYAN, a sizable portion of India stands to be covered. The interim Budget’s focus on the tax front resembles a report card, highlighting the maturity achieved by our tax system. The enhancement of taxpayer services was emphasized as a key priority.","This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data and N for Nari utthan.

Interim Budget for a Viksit Bharat: It’s for everyone and all,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/interim-budget-for-a-viksit-bharat-its-for-everyone-and-all/articleshow/107497439.cms,"By Akhilesh Tuteja

The Finance Minister on February 01, 2024, delivered a truly innovative interim budget. At first glance, it did not seem like an interim budget but looked more like the budget to drive further growth and a continuum of inclusive growth-oriented investments.At the outset, this budget brings a wonderful balance between fiscal prudence and continued investment for growth.It's not easy to continue the glide path of reducing the fiscal deficit and continuing to make significant investments in all areas including infrastructure, R&D, energy transition, technology, skilling, and social welfare. The surprising reduction in fiscal deficit of 5.8% as against the budgeted 5.9% for FY24 and the projection of 5.1% in FY25 with a clear focus on increasing investments was a huge positive.This was a budget for everyone and all because it caters to every part of the Indian economy and society. The FM has carefully catered to the investment needs of various sectors. The continued focus on youth, impoverished, women and farmers to increase their involvement and contribution to economic growth is evident. By committing an 11.1% increase in capital expenditure to 11,11,111 lakh crore, the FM has clearly brought every single 1 in this growth journey.What was very impressive was the inclusion strategy of the government. The focus on women's empowerment for the past few years is unprecedented, which is reflected in the inclusion of women in the workforce moving from 23.3% to 37% in the last five years. The thirty crore Mudra Yojna loans to women entrepreneurs were a great boost to the Nari Shakti initiative. We already have over 10 million Lakhpati Didis and what is truly evident is like a corporate CFO, the FM has revised the earlier target of 20 million Lakhpati Didis to 30 million. The government also plans to invest in initiatives to encourage young girls between the ages of 9 and 14 to undertake the vaccination for cervical cancer which is again a great boost to Nari Shakti.A lot needs to be done to bring more women into all parts of economic growth but the journey so far and the vision of the future is truly inspiring.While India continues on its technological prowess and makes its mark in new technologies like Artificial Intelligence, we need a multi-pronged strategy to harness the power of AI. We need a clear focus on building AI systems in India so that we not only emerge as a global leader in this new era but can build models, which are specific to India that will benefit Indians. At the same time, we need a very wide coverage program to build skills to leverage AI to its fullest potential. The biggest contribution we can make to the inclusion of youth in the economic development of the country is by skilling them in new skill areas. In the last few years, the Skill India Mission has trained 14 million youth, reskilled over 5 million youth and established a staggering 3,000 new ITIs. The future of any country will depend as much on capital investments as on skill investments.The focus on agricultural development and support to the farmer continues through direct financial assistance to farmers. The farmers have benefited by getting crop insurance through PM Fasal Bima Yojana. It's not just the farmers, the PM-SVANidhi provides credit assistance to a large number of street vendors.The last few years have seen the journey of affordable housing through Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY). There is a slight increase in allocation to launch a scheme for encouraging the middle class to build or buy new homes. This investment will likely propel a wider economic development and increase employment.India has seen a tremendous rise in entrepreneurship in the last few years. In order to continue the journey and promote new startups, the government proposes to extend certain tax benefits, which are expiring from March 2024 to March 2025. The MSMEs have not been left behind. With a proposal to provide timely finances to such enterprises, the government has paved the way for their growth, so they can look to compete globally.All in all, it’s a truly inclusive budget with a clear focus on development not just by giving away freebies but enabling the people to participate in the economic development activity. While the FM calls the comprehensive GDP - Governance, Development & Performance – to me, this budget is inclusive of another GDP – gender, demography, and professions.","Akhilesh Tuteja is Partner and Head, Clients and Markets, KPMG in India.

‘Enough domestic sources of demand to counter drag from external sector’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/enough-domestic-sources-of-demand-to-counter-drag-from-external-sector/articleshow/107372012.cms,"Do you think the

creates room for lower interest rates?

One of the issues that the Budget has flagged is the demographic challenge and opportunity and the societal change that is taking place. How do you view this?

Niti Aayog is working on the Viksit Bharat roadmap. What will be the focus areas?

You are as much a representative of the Centre as well as the states. Is it time to revisit the entire formula for transfers to states particularly on the issue of cesses and surcharges?

Suman Bery , who heads Niti Aayog , the govt think tank, is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China, which he says is also an opportunity for India. The economist is confident that Indian states remain resilient. Excerpts of the interview with TOI.The finance ministry expects the economy to grow 7% next year. Given the global situation, how do you see the prospects?The belief in the finance ministry is that we have a possible drag coming from the external sector but that we have other sources. We have enough domestic sources of demand. One has to applaud the political and economic judgment of FM in deciding that it was appropriate to pursue the path of fiscal consolidation. There is transparency. What this actually reflects is responsible economic management, which is one reason we are where we are. Second, it also creates a buffer so that there is policy space if we do encounter headwinds.That’s the hope and expectation. We have an independent central bank and an inflation targeting central bank, so it is up to the monetary policy committee to take a call through the monetary policy committee on the repo rate .The PM has said that when India grows its states grow. India is a composite of 37 states and UTs. They are each at very different points in their demographic transition. There are some states where the net replacement rate is down to 1%, like Kerala . There are others, particularly UP and Bihar, which are in their earliest stage of demographic transition and each one of these states is the size of a large European country. There are two implications of that — one is internal labour mobility and it will become an even larger part of our growth model. The govt has taken several steps to create a unified market. Our main endowment is our human capital and that has to be equipped to participate in global exchange in many ways. We know from China, Japan that the demographic dividend partly depends on markets and on human capital. But the golden period is fairly short lived, about 15 years, when the so called dependency ratio declines. The other big opportunity the PM has been highlighting is bringing women much more into the active labour force.When Niti was set up there was the idea of a three-year vision and a seven-year strategy paper. The reality is that schemes of govt tend to be aligned with the award of the Finance Commission . There are various established building blocks or hand holds which are already a matter of govt policy. The PM is much more interested in a national debate on what it means to be a Viksit Bharat or modern society. We have a collective goal and it is for the democratic polity to define what that goal should be. Its emphatically not for a super mandarin bureaucracy. It is not going to be Lee Kwan Yew’s Singapore led from the top.It’s entirely a finance ministry matter but I would be lying if I didn’t say when I visit certain states there is this complaint. A big frontier would be resource mobilisation at the state level. Second is going to be rationalisation of subsidies not only at the Union level, but also at the state level. All chief ministers sit on my governing council. When they convene as the governing council, I see them in their role as development practitioners. The world is beginning to appreciate quite how much institutional and political maturity India attained in our 75 years and the most fundamental dimension of a democracy, we have orderly transfers of power. There are enough buffers to ensure that what happens in state finances is unlikely to create macro instability. Those risks are well contained by our Constitution. The chief ministers know that they are going to be judged by development outcomes and so you can have the sugar rush of changing of pension plans or various handouts but if the cupboard is bare you are not going to be able to deliver.","Suman Bery is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China.

Government's Marathon to 2047: Emphasis on Fiscal Prudence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/governments-marathon-to-2047-emphasis-on-fiscal-prudence/articleshow/107371788.cms,"What was the thinking behind keeping the vote on account absolutely straight?

So is it the idea to keep the Budget completely transparent?

The capex has risen 11.1% and there is an emphasis on infrastructure spending. But there is also the hope that the private sector will now take over and start capital spending. Given the geopolitical situation, how confident is the govt that it will pan out as planned?

Finance secretary T V Somanathan, in an interview with TOI, says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047 . Excerpts:If you see the Budget speech you will see the emphasis on 2047. The govt has set its sight on running that marathon.Running to 2047 is a marathon , it’s not a sprint. If you are going to run a marathon, you need to be in good shape and you can’t have short-term stimulants or something that will get you some yards and then it’s done.The whole focus is on making India a developed country by 2047, for which a healthy present and a strong fiscal position is an important concomitant. Some purely short term measures don’t really fit into that picture. It’s a consistent picture: focus on the long term for which you need to build strength in the short term and that needs to be done by prudence in fiscal policy and by not doing things which can detract you from that path. Not doing the wrong thing is more important than appearing to do things.The idea is that govt finances may be good, bad or indifferent depending on the times, depending on the circumstances, depending on the policies. But what is the position should be reflected as reasonably and accurately as possible. That is an emphasis. As regards the Finance Commission, again the terms of reference that have been given to them are the terms in the Constitution.What is the means by which the devolution should be done is a matter they have full discretion. They can actually take all kinds of factors into account and in a sense we felt this time based on my review of the previous commissions that the right expression would be less is more. The shorter, less prescriptive terms of reference gives full scope for all stakeholders including state govts to express their viewpoints and for the commission to take a balanced view of the different perspectives and then come to its award. Ultimately the award of the Finance Commission is about devolution and grant for which full scope has now been given to them.n There are incipient signs of private capital expenditure accelerating. There are some surveys I have seen done by some of the chambers industry, which show high levels of investment. The PMI, which is a sort of leading indicator, is also looking pretty healthy. Capacity utilisation is one reason that private sector capital expenditure doesn’t immediately pick up when the economy starts accelerating because there is surplus capacity.But increasingly I get the sense that many industries are beginning to reach levels where they have to add capacity. When that happens capital investment will happen. Another pointer also mentioned in the Budget speech you may notice that our airlines have placed large orders for planes — that is capital expenditure.When you import 1,000 aircraft, it’s just not 1,000 aircraft, there are concomitant additions to ground handling facilities, you need airports to expand, you need to employ people to do that. That means a lot of jobs. The aircraft is capital but then look at the effect it is going to have on skilled jobs. So capital expenditure is happening. I am fairly confident that we will have decent capital expenditure in the year to come and that will become a new source of acceleration.",Finance secretary T V Somanathan says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047.

What is the Section 80C limit for tax deduction for FY 2024-25 after Interim Budget 2024?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/income-tax-budget-2024-2024-2025-section-80c-limit-epf-ppf-elss-nsc/articleshow/107353021.cms,"ALSO READ |

Income Tax Changes Budget 2024 : In the recent Budget 2024 speech, the Finance Minister kept the Section 80C tax deduction limit unchanged. The maximum limit for claiming tax benefits under Section 80C remains at Rs 1.5 lakh for the current fiscal year 2023-24 and will stay the same for individuals looking to save on taxes through Section 80C investments in the upcoming fiscal year 2024-25.Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions. Individuals can reduce their gross taxable income by up to Rs 1.5 lakh per financial year by engaging in these specific investments or expenditures.You can save on taxes through Section 80C by investing in things like Employees' Provident Fund (EPF), Public Provident Fund (PPF), Equity Linked Saving Scheme (ELSS) mutual funds, National Savings Certificate (NSC), and 5-year tax-saving fixed deposits with banks or post offices. Additionally, paying life insurance policy premiums also qualifies for tax benefits under Section 80C.It is important to note that each eligible investment comes with its specific maximum limit, rate of return, liquidity, and taxation rules for the earned returns, states ET in a report. For instance, the most you can invest in PPF in a financial year is Rs 1.5 lakh. Meanwhile, there's no limit on the amount you can invest in ELSS mutual funds, but the Section 80C deduction is capped at Rs 1.5 lakh.If individuals can't make specific investments, they can still get deductions under Section 80C from their gross taxable income through certain expenses. These expenses include repaying the principal amount of a home loan, tuition fees for children, payment of stamp duty, registration fees, and other costs related to buying a house.Since the financial year 2020-21, individuals without any business income must annually choose between the old and new tax regimes. As of the fiscal year 2023-24, the new tax regime is the default option. Consequently, individuals seeking tax deductions under Section 80C must opt for the old tax regime since this deduction isn't available in the new tax regime. It's crucial for taxpayers to be aware of these rules to make informed decisions about their tax planning and investment strategies.","Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget which is an interim budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year. The budget talks about inclusive development both, social and geographical, especially for youth, women, farmers, and the poor. Continued focus on improving logistics through infrastructure spend on roads, rail, airports, ports increases productivity for companies and citizens alike.To make ‘Viksit Bharat’ by 2047, the government’s focus is on improving and empowering people’s capabilities through various skilling initiatives. It is encouraging to see that Skill India Mission has succeeded in training more than 1.4 crore youth and upskilling and reskilling 54 lakh youth. I am particularly happy to see the continued focus on youth and women entrepreneurship and the announcement of a new fund which will give interest free 50 year loans for startups will provide a domestic fillip to startups supplementing venture capital we have traditionally relied on from abroad.PM Mudra Yojana has sanctioned 43 crore loans aggregating to 22.5 lakh crore to youth entrepreneurs and thirty crore Mudra Yojana loans to women entrepreneurs. There are several other schemes like Fund of Funds, Start-Up India, and Start-Up Credit Guarantee schemes that are assisting our youth. Further, the extension of tax benefits to Start-ups and investments made by sovereign wealth funds/pension funds, till 31st March 2025 depicts the government’s effort to support the startup eco- system.This aligns quite well with India Sanitation Coalition’s efforts to give impetus to the start-up world. Over the past 7 editions of our ISC-FICCI Sanitation Awards, we have recognized and promoted several start-ups in the sanitation space, many of whom are successful businesses now!While the finance minister did not provide detailed information on Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH), the budget allocation sees a slight increase in spend demonstrating continued focus on this highly successful program. The acknowledgement that the private sector has increasingly played a substantial role in addressing WASH issues in both urban and rural areas, with numerous projects underway through Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs), highlights the government's commitment to addressing challenges in this sector.A perfect example is the LightHouse Initiative initiated by the Department of Drinking Water along with the India Sanitation Coalition (ISC) by partnering with major corporates across India to develop model villages in Solid and Liquid Waste Management (SLWM) under SBM-Grameen. From this budget, there is an expectation that the government will persist in prioritizing Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) as the path toward achieving the country's Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6). Additionally, it is hoped that the government will uphold its commitment to making necessary infrastructural investments for SLWM.The budget speech rightly celebrates the fact that we have 83 lakh SHGs and 9 crore women beneficiaries. The microfinance movement in the country and the possibility of empowering women members of SHGs through livelihood skilling is a key to bringing women into mainstream economic advancement.The focus on green growth, rooftop solar, wind, biomass, e-vehicles all help with our green energy thrust. The tourism sector was mentioned and could be a huge job provider for youth and women.Guided by the principle ‘Reform, Perform, and Transform’, the budget emphasizes efficient implementation of various policies by improving coordination with states and relevant stakeholders. This is critical both for infra spend and social programsIt is noteworthy that ISC’s Climate Resilient Coastal Cities project which is being implemented in PPP (Public-Private Partnership) mode in four coastal states of Karnataka, Gujarat, Goa and Maharashtra is congruent with the government’s priority of promoting climate-resilient activities for the blue economy 2.0, a scheme for restoration and adaptation measures, and coastal aquaculture.The budget also focuses on the Aspirational districts program where assistance will be given to the states for faster development of aspirational districts and blocks, including the generation of ample economic opportunities. This is again very crucial as it has a huge potential to transform the landscape of our country while making sure no -one is left behind.Overall, this budget has embraced economic strategies and develops the building blocks that nurture and uphold growth, promote inclusive and sustainable development, and enhance productivity.","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year.

Will the next Satya Nadella sit out of India?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/will-the-next-satya-nadella-sit-out-of-india/articleshow/110516271.cms,"In the past decade, as startups have boomed, it has been common to hear experts say: ""It's a matter of time before India produces a Google or Facebook."" That hasn't happened yet, though we too believe it will, sooner than later.Today, as global capability centres (GCCs, the offshore tech & business entities of MNCs ) in India surge, we are beginning to hear similar excited words. ""Maybe the next Satya Nadella is going to be sitting somewhere in Bengaluru,"" says Lalit Ahuja, founder & CEO of ANSR, a consultancy that has helped over 100 GCCs establish bases in India.TOI, and Times Techies in particular, have been tracking the meteoric rise of GCCs for years now. In 2018, we carried a two-pager in TOI on how core operations of MNCs are being moved into their GCCs in India, why India's vast tech talent has become so globally coveted, and how the faces of cities like Bengaluru are being changed by the entry of GCCs. Late last year, we wrote, based on consultancy Zinnov's estimates, that more than 5,000 global leaders of MNCs are sitting out of India GCCs. These are not just tech leaders, but also operations' leaders, including, significantly, the chief customer officer of US data protection and management company Commvault (by that yardstick, the possibility of a Nadella sitting out of India isn't far-fetched). Zinnov estimates this number will rise to 30,000 by 2030. In February, we wrote, based on consultancy Wizmatic's estimates, that the GCC revenue figure of $46 billion that Nasscom put out for 2022-23 could be a gross underestimate, that it could actually be more than $100 billion. That's more than 3% of India's GDP.Today, the India GCC phenomenon has caught international imagination. The Economist magazine has just written articles on it, pointing out also that American firms have 1.5 million staff in India, more than in any other foreign country. They note the substantial contribution of GCCs to India's GDP, and more particularly the country's services exports. They point out that GCCs could do to India what FDI into China's manufacturing did for that country. And the value brought in could be even more significant, considering what's moving into India is the knowledge base of the world.Ankur Mittal, SVP of technology & MD for India at Lowe's, the $86-billion US retailer specialising in home improvement and which has a 5,000-strong GCC in India, says US companies have realised that talent availability in India is ""far superior to most other locations."" There are, he says, pockets of talent in the US, in countries in Europe, but nowhere is the abundance of talent like in India.Ahuja says it's easy to build a large-scale team in India that can be trusted to drive business outcomes with certainty and predictability. ""A company like Best Buy that is just coming into India can hire from Walmart, Target, Lowe's, Amazon, and even Microsoft and Google. They can hire teams within weeks that can build enterprise-grade capabilities and help in digital transformation. A Cigna comes to India and can do 10,000 people in three years,"" he says.He says given that MNCs today are attempting major transformations, it's also far easier for them to do it out of a new remote location. In home locations, he says, there could be employee resistance to change. Young employees in India, he says, also work a lot harder, and are a lot more committed than employees in home locations.Another huge India advantage is the possibility of housing diverse talent under one roof, which almost every MNC today is consciously putting in place. Mittal notes the presence of technology, design, product management, data science, AI and even business talent like marketing and merchandising in Lowe's Bengaluru facility. ""When business is closer to engineers, bringing out a product becomes a lot faster,"" he says.Over 120 global functions across business and engineering are carried out from Goldman Sachs's India GCCs that have 8,500 employees. Over the last two decades, functions performed from India have evolved from end-of-day support for trading platforms and exchange connectivity, to algo trading platform support, data analytics, and client reporting. ""Today, our India GCC is a CoE (centre of excellence) with thought leadership for several equities engineering functions,"" says Gunjan Samtani, global COO of engineering at Goldman Sachs.A major project that the India centre led is Atlas, a low-latency trading platform that hosts a suite of trading strategies to help clients achieve their trading objectives, perform historical analyses, build quantitative models with real-time market information and trade execution. This platform helped trim microseconds in execution of trades for Goldman Sachs' clients. ""This latency reduction helped us engage existing and newer hedge funds and quant clients,"" Samtani says.JPMorgan Chase, the world's largest bank, has some 55,000 people in its India GCCs. Deepak Mangla, CEO of corporate centres for India & Philippines at the bank, says the India GCC is a microcosm of practically all lines of businesses and functions, not just technology. ""We manage operations for the bank, we engage extensively in risk management, we perform significant work for finance and HR controls,"" he says.Among several path-breaking work done at Lowe's India is what's called LORMN (Lowe's One Roof Media Network). It was conceptualised in India and is among the fastest growing retail ad networks in the US. It allows vendors to put ads on Lowe's website and other sites. ""It's very challenging work because everything has to be automated, all the bidding has to happen in milliseconds, and then we have to provide vendors with analytics around it. It's a very high margin business, so it is driving margin and contributing to the topline,"" says Mittal.And that's precisely why more and more global leaders of MNCs are sitting out of India.","TOI, and Times Techies in particular, have been tracking the meteoric rise of GCCs for years now.

There is duplication of notifications as apps used for UPI payments also send out alerts.According to bankers, there is a cost of Rs 0.01-0.03 for bulk text messages. Given that UPI transactions are averaging around 40 crore a day, banks spend a few crores of rupees a day on text messages.Banks are also encouraging customers to shift to UPI Lite for transactions up to Rs 500.

Hindalco will own about 92.5% of the company after the IPO.At the top of the indicated range, Novelis would have a market value of about $12.6 billion, based on the outstanding shares listed in its filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.Novelis has been on a decade-long drive to boost production capacity and is the world's largest aluminium recycler, operating 14 scrap-processing plants across North America, Europe, Asia and South America. The world's biggest maker of flat-rolled aluminium products ranging from cars to soda cans, said in Feb it had filed confidentially for the listing with regulators.Hindalco purchased Novelis in 2007 at about a $6 billion valuation including debt, a filing from the time shows.

NEW DELHI: Scorching heat, cloudless skies and searing winds blowing from Rajasthan sent Tuesday's day temperature soaring to an all-time high on record in Delhi. While the mercury shot up to 49.9°C - nine notches above normal - in Mungeshpur and Narela, it was 49.8°C in Najafgarh.In Safdarjung, the city's base observatory, maximum temperature was 45.8 degrees, five degrees above normal, and the highest this year.There is little respite in sight in the next two days, with India Meteorological Department (IMD) issuing a red alert for heatwave and severe heatwave for Wednesday and an orange alert for Thursday, when the day temperature may witness a very slight drop. However, there's a glimmer of hope: the capital may receive very light rain on Friday and Saturday, according to IMD.Rain is nowhere in sight in Delhi but it's definitely raining records, with parts of the capital just a touch shy of 50 degrees Celsius mark.Rajasthan's Churu, meanwhile, was the hottest place in India on Tuesday at 50.5°C - close to its highest-ever temperature of 50.8°C. In Rajasthan's Phalodi, 51°C in 2016 is the all-time record in the country.""The winds blowing into Delhi have a majority of westerly component from Haryana and Rajasthan. Under this impact, the city, especially its outer areas, are witnessing a huge rise in temperature,"" said Kuldeep Srivastava, senior weather scientist, IMD.Srivastava said since the westerly winds were dry, the humidity, too, had dropped, which was reflecting in the city's heat index or 'feel-like temperature'. ""The heat index of the city on Tuesday was 47°C, while a few days back it was 55°C, even though the maximum temperatures were slightly lower then. Since the humidity is low, the discomfort level is not as high as it was a few days back,"" he said.Apart from Mungeshpur, Narela and Najafgarh, several areas of the city, including Pitampura, Pusa and Jafarpur, also recorded severe heatwave on Tuesday, with the maximum temperature eight to nine notches above normal.The situation was not much different in the city's neighbourhood. Gurgaon witnessed the season's highest temperature at 47 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, marking the third heatwave day this season. As the temperature soared, there was a forest fire at the Aravalis near Faridabad's Surajkund around 1pm on Tuesday. Although the fire department managed to douse the flames within 30 minutes, several acres and trees had already been charred, residents alleged. Noida sizzled at 47.3.With temperatures exceeding 42 degrees Celsius, people are prone to heat stroke, which is a medical emergency characterised by an elevation in core body temperature, often exceeding 104°F (40°C). Doctors say the heat stroke may lead to central nervous system dysfunction. When the body's thermoregulatory mechanisms fail, extreme dehydration ensues, signalling an alarm.Highlighting the perils of the hot temperatures, doctors warn that a heat stroke could even lead to a brain stroke in extreme situations, particularly when it causes excessive dehydration, which leads to the thickening of blood and makes its flow challenging throughout the body.Meanwhile, the city continued to reel under poor air quality. The air quality index (AQI), on a scale of 0 to 500, was 244 on Tuesday, against 223 a day earlier.","Temperatures hit 49.9°C in Mungeshpur and Narela, 49.8C in Najafgarh.

After that, SIT also issued a notice. I sought a week’s time to respond to the SIT notice through my lawyers and X handle.”The suspended JD(S) functionary alleges that several people in his constituency conspired against him “as I was growing politically in Hassan”.“Looking at all these things, I was shocked; so I was a bit away. No one should mistake my absence for fleeing.”Prajwal, who is seeking re-election from Hassan, insists in the video that his trip was planned before the allegations surfaced. “There was no case against me at the time, and SIT was “not formed” either.Addressing his family and supporters, the son of former minister HD Revanna says, “I apologise to my parents, my grandfather, (uncle) Kumaraswamy and my party workers, and the people of the state.

Malaysia is a major player in the semiconductor industry, accounting for 13% of global testing and packaging. It has attracted multi-billion dollar investments from leading firms in recent years, including Intel and Infineon.

Anwar said the investment being sought would be for integrated circuit design , advanced packaging and manufacturing equipment for semiconductor chips .

Malaysia also wants to establish at least 10 local companies in design and advanced packaging for semiconductor chips, with revenues between $210 million to $1 billion, Anwar said in a speech at an industry event.

The Southeast Asian country will allocate $5.3 billion in fiscal support to meet these targets, he added.

Shanghai lifts home-buying curbs to boost property sector,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/shanghai-lifts-home-buying-curbs-to-boost-property-sector/articleshow/110483968.cms,"SHANGHAI: Shanghai has relaxed rules on buying property in the city, as local governments across China aim to ease an agonising real estate crisis that is dragging on the economy.Many cities imposed restrictions and tough credit requirements on home purchases well over a decade ago in an effort to tamp down soaring prices and rampant speculation.But they are now reversing those policies in a bid to stem an economic slump characterised by a debt crisis among developers, low demand and falling prices.On Monday, economic powerhouse Shanghai -- China's largest and richest city -- said it would reduce the number of years that people were required to live there before they could buy property. Purchasers only have to have resided in the city three years, instead of five.The megacity also said it would reduce the minimum down payment for commercial housing mortgages to 20 percent, as well as permit families with two or more children to buy an additional home.The announcement followed similar moves in major Chinese cities such as Hangzhou and Xi'an this month, reducing purchase restrictions for first-time buyers.And the central government has moved in recent weeks to stem the crisis in the property and construction sector, which long accounted for a quarter of gross domestic product.This month, Beijing cut the minimum down payment rate for first-time homebuyers to its lowest level in history and suggested the government could buy up unused commercial real estate.No details were provided on how many houses would be bought.","Shanghai relaxes rules on buying property in the city.

Musk's xAI raises $6 billion from VC funds,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/musks-xai-raises-6-billion-from-vc-funds/articleshow/110479955.cms,"Elon Musk 's artificial intelligence startup xAI has raised $6 billion to accelerate its challenge to his former allies at OpenAI .

The series-B round, announced in a blog post on May 26, comes less than a year after xAI's debut and marks one of the bigger investments in the nascent field of developing AI tools. Musk had been an early supporter of AI, backing OpenAI before it introduced ChatGPT in late 2022. He later withdrew his support from the venture and has advocated caution because of the technology's potential dangers. He was among a large group of industry leaders urging a pause to AI development last year.

Musk launched a rival to OpenAI's ChatGPT in Nov, called Grok, which was trained on and integrated into X, the social network formerly known as Twitter. That has so far been the most visible product of xAI's work, which is led by executives with prior experience at Alphabet's DeepMind, Microsoft and Tesla.

The company intends to use the funds to bring its first products to market, build advanced infrastructure and accelerate the development of future technologies, it said in the blog. Its pre-money valuation was $18 billion, Musk said in a post on X. Marquee venture capital names including Sequoia Capital and Andreessen Horowitz backed the fundraising, which is one of the largest so far in the industry. Microsoft has invested about $13 billion in OpenAI, while Amazon put about $4 billion into Anthropic.

As Bitcoin recently gathered bullish momentum and surged beyond the $70,000 mark, other altcoins like Litecoin , Stellar , Avalanche and the new meme coin KangaMoon are also being propelled by this surge. Let us find out why.The Bitcoin price fought to stay over $70,000 on May 22 as Glassnode analysts speculated that the pioneer cryptocurrency was getting ready for a ""bigger move"" upward. Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView data indicate that following a protracted decline from all-time highs, the Bitcoin price has been rising steadily, as evident on the Bitcoin price chart.Glassnode reports that although most important on-chain measures are moving toward equilibrium, Bitcoin's recent recovery to $71,000 is the result of ""compression of volatility"" and easing sell-side pressure. Glassnode analysts saw a “large decline” in the one- and two-year cohorts over the past two months using the Supply Last Active Age Band indicator.In case Bitcoin keeps rising to $73,000, the Litecoin price may have upward momentum since it recently tested the bottom limit of the daily Ichimoku cloud. The lower limit of the Ichimoku cloud serves as an important support level, and keeping a position above it is necessary to keep a bullish trend going. Should the Litecoin price be able to penetrate the cloud, it may advance toward the $93 crucial resistance level.With further support around $85.70 as seen on the Litecoin price chart, the altcoin may go towards the major resistance level around $93. Maintaining the upward trend therefore depends on keeping above the cloud. A first line of protection for Litecoin is the 38.2% Fibonacci level at $85.09. Should this support be breached, the trend may be deteriorating and more selling pressure may be introduced.With the recent deployment of Protocol 21 by the Stellar (XLM) testnet, its main network made a major stride. A mainnet vote is planned for June 18, 2024, and this update includes important features like passkey signing and cheaper smart contract transactions. These improvements are meant to greatly increase the Stellar network efficiency and reduce running costs.Moreover, the continuous dedication of the Stellar network to increasing worldwide access to and affordability of financial services is reflected in Protocol 21. Stellar is carefully improving its infrastructure to support a larger, more inclusive financial ecosystem by putting CAPs 0054, 0055, and 0056 into place, while nevertheless keeping costs low for users worldwide. Amid these, the Stellar price has seen a notable rise by 3% to $0.11 per token within the past week.For weeks, the Avalanche price has stayed between $30 and $40. The Avalanche price dropped to the $35 area in March after rising above $60, and it has subsequently had difficulty breaking beyond the $40 barrier. Nonetheless, recent positive trends suggest that there may be a rally to retake the $40 mark.At $39.91, Avalanche has increased in its price by over 15% during the last week while the Avalanche market cap has also risen slightly by 0.65% to reach $15.68 billion. Moreover, the price of Avalanche might reach its March high of $60.69 if sentiment in the larger cryptocurrency market improves.Because of its presale performance, KangaMoon (KANG) has become more well-known to the general public amid the current meme coin craze. In addition, KANG has almost hit $7 million. Furthermore, there are presently over 32,000 registered KangaMoon users. The primary goal of KangaMoon is to profit from the Play-to-Earn (P2E) gaming market, which is expected to generate $8856 million by 2028.The group intends to develop a play-to-earn (P2E) game in which users may purchase items with KANG and level up their characters. KANG will gain from this development, and it will gain more than 99% of other hype-driven memecoins . The SocialFi aspect of KangaMoon is what distinguishes it from other projects.Put another way, prior to debut, KangaMoon is giving out free KANG based on how much people interact on its social media channels, which include Telegram and X. As a result, a large number of individuals are appreciating and sharing KangaMoon's social media content. Each KANG is currently valued at $0.025—400% higher than its initial pricing of $0.005—during the bonus stage of its presale.Analysts, however, predict that KANG might rise 100x after it is listed on a Tier-1 CEX like BitMart, which has announced the meme coin's listing. This might just be the start. Moreover, KangaMoon is already listed on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko. Considering that fans of cryptocurrencies are anticipating a sharp increase in value, KANG is among the best meme coins to buy now.Among the most promising memecoins, KangaMoon has already attracted the interest of numerous investors. Furthermore, because KangaMoon now has a small market capitalization, inflating the token's price is less expensive. Because of this, experts believe that after KANG is listed on BitMart , its price will soar above $1.Click here to know more.","The Bitcoin price fought to stay over $70,000 on May 22 as Glassnode analysts speculated that the pioneer cryptocurrency was getting ready for a ""bigger move"" upward.

The more-active August contract rose 25 cents to $82.09.US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose 24 cents to $77.96.Brent ended last week about 2% lower and WTI lost nearly 3% after Federal Reserve minutes showed some officials would be willing to tighten interest rates further if they believed it was necessary to control persistent inflation.Public holidays in the US and UK on Monday are expected to keep trading relatively thin.The upcoming meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, known as OPEC+, was pushed back by a day and will be held online, OPEC said on Friday.The producers will discuss whether to extend voluntary output cuts of 2.2 million barrels per day into the second half of the year, with three sources from OPEC+ countries saying an extension was likely.Oil futures are expected to maintain today's gains due expectations of the cuts being extended, said Sugandha Sachdeva, founder of Delhi-based research firm SS WealthStreet.""However, the trajectory of price action will be significantly influenced by the US Producer Price Index (PPI) data scheduled for the week, which will in turn shape the Federal Reserve's approach to potential rate adjustments,"" Sachdeva said.Combined with another 3.66 million bpd of production cuts valid through the end of the year, the output cuts are equivalent to nearly 6% of global oil demand.OPEC has said it expects another year of relatively strong growth in oil demand of 2.25 million bpd, while the International Energy Agency expects much slower growth of 1.2 million bpd.ANZ analysts said in a note that they will be watching gasoline usage as the Northern Hemisphere enters summer, traditionally a high season due to driving holidays.""While US holiday trips are expected to hit a post-COVID high, improved fuel efficiency and EVs could see oil demand remain soft,"" the analysts said. But they added that could be offset by rising air travel.Markets will also be watching the US personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index this week for more signals about interest rate policy.
