In cases where the assessee is untraceable, separate strategies need to be developed.The focus on tax demands is one of the critical areas flagged in the central action plan circulated to officers for the current financial year as the Centre seeks to maximise revenue generation to meet its large spending needs.The department has also estimated net collectible demand of Rs 16.7 lakh crore, while underlining arrear management and set targets to recover close to Rs 8 lakh crore. Of this nearly 35% or over Rs 2.8 lakh crore is targeted to come from Mumbai, followed by Delhi (Rs 86,692 crore) and Tamil Nadu and Puducherry.Besides, the plan comes with the usual emphasis on tracking high value cash transactions across hotels and hospitals and chasing individuals with large transactions that do not match with the income disclosed in their tax returns.","The income tax department has asked its officers to focus on top 5,000 cases accounting for Rs 43 lakh crore of tax demand.

Source: ET quoting CA (Dr.) Suresh Surana

Over 7.28 crore income tax returns (ITR) were filed by July 31, 2024 and approximately 5 crore of these ITRs were filed by July 26, 2024, indicating that 2.28 crore ITRs were filed between July 27 and July 31, 2024. Consequently, the deadline for verifying the 2.28 crore ITRs filed in the last days of July falls between August 26 and August 30, 2024.It is crucial for taxpayers who submitted their ITRs during this period and have not yet verified them to do so promptly to avoid the penalty associated with filing a late ITR.As per income tax rules, ""The time limit for e-verification or submission of ITR-V (offline process) is 30 days from the date of filing of the ITR.""According to an ET report, the tax department reported that the total number of ITRs filed until August 20, 2024, was 7,41,37,596, with 7,09,89,014 (approximately 7.09 crore) ITRs verified by 6PM on the same day. This indicates that around 32 lakh ITRs were filed but not verified as of August 20, 2024.Although the total number of verified ITRs as of August 19 may include ITRs filed after July 31, it is estimated that at least 19 lakh ITRs out of the 7.28 crore filed by July 31, 2024, are yet to be verified.Chartered accountant Dr Suresh Surana spoke about the 30-day time limit for ITR verification,, ""Such a time-period shall be calculated including the 30th day as per the bare reading of the provisions of the income tax act. The income tax return filed under section 139(1) has to be verified within a period of 30 days from the date of furnishing the ITR. Hence if the ITR is filed on 31st July, 2024, the same shall be verified up to 30th August, 2024."" Verification of ITR is essential for processing the return and receiving tax refunds.Ashish Niraj, a chartered accountant and partner at A S N & Company, told ET that if an individual has filed their ITR online but used the offline process (ITR-V) for verification and the form is submitted or reaches the Centralized Processing Center (CPC) beyond 30 days from the date of filing the ITR, it will be considered as if the individual has not filed an ITR at all. ""Hence all consequences of late filing of ITR under the Act shall follow,"" he says.Filing an income tax return is necessary to receive an income tax refund if you are eligible for one. In case you missed the July 31, 2024 deadline for filing the ITR or filed it by the deadline but failed to verify it within the 30-day period, you can still file a belated ITR. It is crucial to verify the filed ITR before the 30-day deadline expires; otherwise, your effort will be in vain, and you may not receive the tax refund.CA Twinkle Jain explains, ""If an ITR is not verified within this (the 30 day) period, it is considered invalid. This means that any tax refund claims associated with these ITRs will not be processed, and the taxpayer may have to file the ITR again, resulting in a delay in the tax refund process.""Failing to verify the submitted ITR within the 30-day deadline would result in the need to file a belated ITR and face the consequences of late filing, such as a late fee under section 234F of Rs 5,000 (limited to Rs 1,000 if the total income does not exceed Rs 5 lakh).Furthermore, if you have not verified the ITR filed before the 30-day deadline and the ITR filing deadline (July 31, 2024) has passed, you may not be able to opt for the old tax regime.","As per income tax rules, ""The time limit for e-verification or submission of ITR-V (offline process) is 30 days from the date of filing of the ITR"" It is crucial for taxpayers who submitted their ITRs during this period and have not yet verified them to do so promptly.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112707486,imgsize-29474,width-400,resizemode-4/112707486.jpg"
Fastest manufacturing growth in 50 years? Apple’s India business surpasses Rs 2 lakh crore; tech giant India’s largest global value chain,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/fastest-manufacturing-growth-in-50-years-apples-india-business-surpasses-rs-2-lakh-crore-tech-giant-indias-largest-global-value-chain/articleshow/112513335.cms,"Apple's Growing Harvest

Apple’s India business grows in leaps! In FY24, Apple 's India operations witnessed a remarkable surge, reaching a value of over Rs 2 lakh crore ($23.5 billion), a significant increase from Rs 1.15 lakh crore in the previous year. A significant increase in iPhone production, along with strong domestic sales of MacBooks, iMacs, iPads, Watches, and AirPods, has boosted the value of Apple's operations in India.Top officials told ET that Apple's growth in production and exports in India over the last 50 years is likely the fastest and unparalleled by any other company, establishing the tech giant as the largest global value chain (GVC) operating within the country. Moreover, Apple is the first GVC in India to rapidly shift a portion of its supply chain away from China.The acceleration in Apple's operations in India can be attributed to the government's introduction of the smartphone production-linked incentive ( PLI ) scheme in 2020.In 2021, Apple began manufacturing iPhones in India, marking the first time the company produced iPhones outside of China. Since then, iPhone production in India has steadily increased through its three contract manufacturers – Foxconn, Wistron, and Pegatron – reaching Rs 1.20 lakh crore in FY24. The government provides incentives based on the freight on board (FOB) value at which the devices leave the factory, with market value or retail prices being 50-60% higher.The Economic Survey highlights India's contribution to Apple's overall production, which has risen to approximately 14%, positioning the country as a crucial hub for the company's global exports. In FY23, India's share was around 7%. iPhones constitute the majority of these figures, with exported iPhones valued at around Rs 1.35 lakh crore ($15 billion) in the last fiscal year, based on official data calculations.Domestic sales of Apple products in India reached approximately Rs 68,000 crore ($8 billion) in FY24. In FY23, Apple exported iPhones with a market value of Rs 66,000 crore. The company's market share in India, although steadily increasing from 2% in FY18, remains below 6% due to the dominance of the Android ecosystem, led by Chinese brands such as Vivo and Xiaomi. Additionally, India's revenue contribution to Apple's global revenue of $383 billion in FY23 was less than 2%.Also Read | Apple ecosystem becomes biggest blue-collar job creator in India! 1.5 lakh direct jobs created since PLI scheme India revenue figures of Apple do not include export numbers, but the increase in manufacturing by the Apple ecosystem has generated more than 150,000 direct jobs since 2021. The company's largest factory in India, operated by Foxconn, employs 41,000 individuals.During the third-quarter earnings call in August, Apple CEO Tim Cook announced that the company had achieved ""quarterly revenue records in more than two dozen countries and regions, including Canada, Mexico, France, Germany, the UK, India, Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand.""Despite Apple's success, smartphone shipments in India experienced a 2% year-on-year decline in the June quarter, according to Counterpoint Research. The market tracker attributed this decline to factors such as the heatwave, a seasonal slump, and a sequential slowdown in demand compared to the previous quarter.Recognizing the significance of India in the current geopolitical landscape, Cook visited the country in April last year to meet with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and inaugurate the first two company-owned retail stores in Delhi and Mumbai.During the earnings call in May, Cook emphasized the company's comprehensive approach to India, stating, ""the company was working on everything — from developers to markets and operations — in India. I see it as an incredibly exciting market and as a major focus for us.""","In FY24, Apple's India operations witnessed a remarkable surge, reaching a value of over Rs 2 lakh crore ($23.5 billion) A significant increase in iPhone production, along with strong domestic sales of MacBooks, iMacs, iPads, Watches, and AirPods, has boosted the value of Apple's operations in India.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112514332,imgsize-127566,width-400,resizemode-4/112514332.jpg"
"New bank locker rules: Amendments to nomination rule for bank lockers, deposits proposed",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-bank-locker-rules-amendments-to-nomination-rule-for-bank-lockers-deposits-proposed-heres-what-you-should-know/articleshow/112517270.cms,"Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has introduced the Banking Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2024, which proposes to increase the number of nominees allowed per bank account and locker from one to four. The current Banking Regulation Act permits single or joint deposit holders to appoint a nominee for their deposit, items left in the custody of a bank, or a locker hired from a bank.In the event of the nominator's death, the nominee can access the deposit, articles, or locker.According to an ET report, the new Bill suggests allowing up to four nominees for these purposes. For deposits, nominees can be appointed either successively or simultaneously, while for other purposes, they can only be appointed successively.When there are multiple simultaneous nominees, the nomination will be effective in a predetermined proportion. In the case of successive nominations, priority will be given to the nominee named higher in the nomination order.""The Banking Regulation Act allows single or joint deposit holders to appoint a nominee for their deposit. Such a nominee can also be appointed for items left in custody of a bank or for a locker hired from a bank. The nominee can access the deposit, articles, or locker in case of death of the person who nominated him. The Bill allows the appointment of up to four nominees for these purposes. For deposits, such nominees can be appointed either successively or simultaneously while for other purposes they can be appointed successively. In case of simultaneous nominees, the nomination will be effective in a declared proportion. For successive nomination, the nominee who has been named higher in the order of nomination will receive priority,"" according to The Banking Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2024 quoted in the ET report.Also Read | Latest FD rates: Which PSU banks are offering highest fixed deposit rates in August 2024? Check List Nomination is a crucial aspect of opening lockers and savings accounts in India. The Indian Banks' Association (IBA) says, ""Banking Companies (Nomination) Rules 1985 permits banks to pay dues to nominees in the event of death of depositor(s) without asking for succession certificate or verifying claims of legal heirs. This simplifies settlement. Of course, as Trustee the nominee is accountable to legal heirs.The IBA further clarifies that the nomination facility is available for bank deposits, safe deposit lockers, and safe custody articles. A single deposit account, whether held individually or jointly, can have only one nominee. However, a jointly held locker can have two nominees. In the case of a minor's account, a person legally empowered to operate the account can file a nomination on behalf of the minor.The State Bank of India emphasizes the importance of availing the benefits of nomination facility and survivorship clause for locker-hirers. In the unfortunate event of the death of one of the joint locker-hirers, the contents of the locker do not automatically transfer to the surviving joint locker-hirer or nominee(s) unless there is a survivorship clause or nomination in place.When renting a locker, the bank charges a nominal annual rent based on the size of the locker and the location of the branch. The rent should be paid in advance for the financial year. The bank provides a copy of the signed Locker Agreement to the locker-hirer, outlining their rights and responsibilities.","The Banking Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2024 proposes to increase the number of nominees allowed per bank account and locker from one to four. The current Banking Regulation Act permits single or joint deposit holders to appoint a nominee for their deposit, items left in the custody of a bank, or a locker hired from a bank.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112517954,imgsize-36802,width-400,resizemode-4/112517954.jpg"

With FDs, you can expect a guaranteed return on your invested funds, which remain unaffected by market fluctuations. This is the reason that FDs are a go to investment option for most risk averse investors.Interest rates for fixed deposits are near all time highs, with RBI pausing the rate cycle for several monetary policy meetings now.Investors have the flexibility to choose between the re-investment deposit option, which allows for the accumulation of compound interest, or the option to receive interest payments at regular intervals (monthly/quarterly) to support their financial planning and budgeting needs, notes an ET report.The interest rates offered on fixed deposits in August 2024 can vary based on several factors, including the specific bank, the age of the depositor, the tenure of the deposit, and the amount invested.In India, private banks are financial institutions where private companies or individuals hold the majority of the equity, in contrast to public-sector banks where the government is the primary shareholder.Public Sector Undertaking (PSU) banks are ones where the government owns the majority of the shares. These banks receive government subsidies with the aim of facilitating their growth and expansion.For investors interested in comparing fixed deposit interest rates between private and public sector banks, a brief analysis of the fixed deposit rates offered to both general citizens and senior citizens is provided below.","Public Banks: Latest Fixed Deposit Interest Rates For General Citizens.

Railway Budget 2024 : The government has wavered little in its efforts to spur a modernisation of railways in the country, pivoting on technology, to support the country’s economic ambitions. In line with expectations, Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore, marking yet another year of successive increase in outlay.That takes forward the past policies and the government’s vision, which have paved the way for modernisation of the transport behemoth.In earlier decades, the government had focused on laying tracks on new routes, electrification and incremental rolling stock capacity addition. That was the need of the hour back then and has helped set up the base for a larger transformation.For instance, the massive Dedicated Freight Corridor ( DFC ) as well as locomotive factories at Marhaura and Madhepura in Bihar were conceptualised over a decade ago and we are seeing their completion now.More recently, the focus has shifted to modernisation—of rolling stock and safety systems, among other aspects.This year, emphasis has also been laid on the railways’ crucial role in industrial development. Commodity-specific corridors have been planned in eastern India and impetus given to port connectivity. Vande Bharat and technology-led upgrades in rolling stock remain in focus. Safety has been prioritised through budgetary allocations for the anti-collision systemKavach . That said, there are other cogs in the wheel that demand attention from a long-term perspective.First, the target for the Operating Ratio, the crucial efficiency gauge, has been set at 98.22% for 2024-25, compared with 98.65% in 2023-24. This reflects an imminent need for operational transformation. An effective overhaul of the world’s fourth-largest rail network will take many years and thus we need to start focusing on improving efficiency and reducing costs now.DFC is almost entirely operational and will be complete over the next few months. To ensure the project achieves its twin goals of reducing logistics costs and enhancing freight efficiency, railways need to attract more cargo on the corridor. This will help increase the rail coefficient and make the railways’ approach more market-oriented, which will in turn aid future corridors.A revamp of railway stations is on track, with sufficient funds dedicated to this end. But even though new coaches and wagons are increasingly being added to meet footfalls, the stations and passenger trains themselves remain synonymous with chaos.Just as safety, comfort and convenience have been prioritised, there is a need for solutions to address the capacity and demand challenges. As a first step, the government could target development of new stations and setting up of new coach production units.As a leading freight mover, Indian Railways carried a record 1,588 MT cargo in fiscal 2024, up from 1,095 MT in fiscal 2015. It accounts for 26% of the cargo moved in the country—by no means an easy feat. The railways aims to take this volume to 3,000 MT by 2030, which would require a 11% CAGR against the around 4.2% witnessed over the last 10 years. As per a report by TERI and Shakti Foundation, from carrying about 62% of freight traffic in 1990-91, Indian Railways’ share has declined to ~27% in 2014-15. This has been due to the expanding road network, cost competitiveness over railways, and door-to-door service. Thus, commencing the cycle of increasing the rail share again is commendable.DFCs, a high-capacity track network, high-power locomotives and improvement in wagon designs have set the ball rolling for larger capacity, faster freight trains that deliver better efficiency.Yet, achieving exponential growth is a tall ask given the current dynamics. Possibly, similar challenges might apply to other goals the railways might have for 2047.To be fair, despite its scale and complexity, Indian Railways has been able to achieve diverse developments at commendable speed.But the track ahead is long and it is time to start discussing the reinvention of the institutional set-up.Indian Railways sees substantial private sector involvement in the form of vendors and contractors. Policymakers could start mulling extreme options such as parallel privately-owned and operated railway infrastructure, coupled with centralised planning and an evolved role for the railways. This will need a robust policy framework from the Government of India.The time is perhaps also ripe to bring user charge and asset monetisation-driven segments for passengers as well as cargo to the discussion table. Globally, the separation of infrastructure and operations in railways has delivered mixed results, for example in the United Kingdom. The model should be analysed and revisited to understand its potential relevance in the Indian context.The key would be to retrace our steps and align our long-term goals to identify not just incremental changes but also ways to explore bold and path-breaking alternatives that put Indian Railways on a smooth track and bring it up to speed.","Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore.

Budget 2024 capital gains tax changes: The Narendra Modi government is considering suggestions for tweaks in the new long term capital gains tax regime that was announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman in Union Budget 2024.The July 23 budget reduced the LTCG tax on property from 20% to 12.5%. The indexation benefit, which allowed taxpayers to adjust the acquisition cost for inflation before calculating capital gains and thus reduce their tax liability, is proposed to be eliminated for properties purchased on or after April 1, 2001.The government publishes the Cost Inflation Index (CII) annually for this calculation.India Inc is appealing to the government for a gradual shift to the long-term capital gains tax regime proposed in the FY25 budget, which aims to eliminate indexation benefits for property, gold, and other unlisted assets.According to an ET report by Deepshikha Sikarwar, the industry is suggesting alternatives such as a higher tax rate with indexation or a lower rate of 12.5% without indexation, as well as some form of grandfathering for ancestral properties.The finance ministry is currently reviewing these proposals and will discuss them with the Prime Minister's Office. The final decision will be made closer to the date when the Finance Bill reply is to be presented in Parliament, the reports said.Industry groups are expected to submit formal proposals to the finance ministry in the near future. ""We are proposing that some time be given to taxpayers for transition,"" said an official with a leading industry lobby group.Also Read | New Budget 2024 rule: Why Income Tax Department is likely to issue a huge number of tax notices this month The finance ministry has already conducted one round of discussions regarding the concerns raised by various stakeholders about the move, including the potential increase in black money transactions.""Since the sudden transition to a new capital gains regime impacts existing properties held by taxpayers, the amendment has a retroactive impact for such taxpayers,"" said an official with another industry body supporting a transition regime.The proposed suggestions include giving the seller of a property the option of either a 20% LTCG rate with indexation or a 12.5% LTCG rate without that benefit.""As per tax policy diligently followed by the current government, any drastic change in regime has been made in a gradual manner, by providing options to taxpayers to choose between the old regime and new regime,"" said Sudhir Kapadia, senior advisor at EY, supporting the suggestion.Also Read | How Budget 2024 announcements will spur balanced growth of real estate sector He cited examples such as domestic companies having the choice between a concessional 22% tax rate under Section 115 BAA without incentives and deductions, or the normal 30% tax rate after claiming permitted tax incentives and deductions, as well as individual taxpayers having the choice between two separate tax regimes—one with deductions and the other without.

Budget 2024 for manufacturing sector : The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth. While the middle class has been offered tax relief, the government's primary focus remains on judicious spending to maximize economic impact. The budget's core themes are employment, skilling, MSME development, and support for the middle class.Largely focus has remained intact on spending money judiciously to ensure that each penny spent creates a ripple effect in the entire economic landscape.Although at first glance, manufacturing might appear to have taken a backseat, a deeper analysis reveals a multifaceted approach to bolstering the sector. Initiatives like employment-linked benefits and internship programs, while primarily aimed at job creation and skill development, indirectly benefit manufacturing companies by expanding the talent pool.Extensive focus on the MSME manufacturing units by way of extending term loan facility for purchase of machinery and equipment without collateral or third-party guarantee, would help companies in augmenting their capital base/ capacity and strengthen the very foundation of the manufacturing ecosystem in the country. Development of a new credit-assessment model by Public Sector Banks to assess MSME credit shall provide much needed regulatory relief to the units.With respect to the large manufacturing entities, while there is no direct fiscal/ tax incentive introduced in this budget, some support has been provided with an extensive focus on development of ‘industrial parks’ in nearly 100 cities under the ‘plug and play’ model. Reforms proposed with respect to land administration, planning and management, shall also ease out acquisition related difficulties often faced by entrepreneurs/ business houses in acquiring lands for manufacturing set-ups.Targeted Customs duty interventions like, rationalization of Customs duty provisions in Mobile phone manufacturing setups, extension of Customs duty exemption on import of capital goods for manufacturing of solar cells and panels, full Customs duty exemption on import of 25 critical minerals,, shall provide the required impetus for enhancing domestic manufacturing environment.Governments’ focus on formulating an Economic Policy Framework to set the scope for next-gen reforms in the country, has a target to improve the productivity of factors of production, namely, land, labour, capital, entrepreneurship and technology. This shall pave the way for enabling achievement of a target of 25% manufacturing sector contribution to the nation’s GDP over the course of next 7-10 years.While the overall outlook is positive, the extension of tax benefits under Section 115BAB for manufacturing entities and the absence of new PLI schemes are notable omissions.The country’s manufacturing base is expanding as is reflective from the continuously increasing tax collections and expanding Purchasing Manager’s Index. It would be pertinent to see how the ground realities evolve vis-à-vis the vision envisaged, in the upcoming Financial Year.","The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth.

Budget 2024: Armed with the vision to propel India to become a developed country by 2047, the Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business thereby providing the required stimulus to the manufacturing sector and enabling large scale job creation.On the Indirect tax front, the industry welcomes the much-needed announcement for a comprehensive review of the rate structure under Customs enabling ease in product classification and dispute reduction. The proposal of lowering of Customs duty on a plethora of raw materials and products including solar cells, critical minerals and bullion are encouraging measures. The rationale behind such reduction clearly indicates support towards domestic manufacturing, deepening value addition and supporting targets in reducing carbon footprint.Relevant amendments under the Customs law have been made to provide increased time limits for re-imports and re-exports to enhance competitiveness of the fledgling MRO sector. The government has extended significant duty reduction and exemption benefits to the healthcare and electronics sectors, continuing the impetus of incentives provided under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme.Since their introduction in March 2020, the PLI schemes have indeed supported in revitalizing the manufacturing sector and strengthening the necessary supply chains. The success achieved in the mobile manufacturing sector has now enabled the Government to reduce customs duties on mobile phones and components, signalling a mature environment. The Budget proposals aim at reproducing similar outcomes for semiconductor and pharmaceutical industry by increasing the budgetary allocation.Buoyed by the increasing revenue collection under GST signalling a shift towards a mature tax regime, this Budget has harmonized the timeframes for the issuance of demand notices and adjudication orders for cases involving fraud, suppression or otherwise. Significant amendments to the GST legislations have been introduced reflecting the recommendations proposed by the GST Council such as regularizing non-levy of GST due to general practice which may turn out to be a breather for certain impacted industries reeling under huge tax demands.The Insurance sector has been provided much relief through the GST council recommendations which have been cemented in the present budget thereby ending long standing disputes on their business practices.The Government's efforts to push forward with its reform agenda are evident as plans to incentivize states for their business reform actions plans and digitalization through the Jan Vishwas Bill 2.0 is proposed. Further, setting up of e-commerce export hubs is envisaged to facilitate easier access to international markets for domestic players.The recent implementation of Budget proposals allows the government to maintain momentum in its reform agenda. These policy measures implicitly reaffirm the significance of India Inc as a crucial element in the development of infrastructure. However, there are still some expectations required to be met to march towards a Viksit Bharat 2047.",The Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business.

Budget 2024 : Real estate, a significant contributor to employment generation, has received a fair bit of attention in Budget 2024-25. Recent years have seen the sector transform rapidly, driven by factors such as favourable government policies, Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, strong economic growth and changing consumer preferences.Added to that, the budgetary focus on job creation, skilling and employment-linked incentives, infrastructure, urban development, rural connectivity, digitalisation and land-related norms, all dovetail to promote growth of the sector.Launched in June 2015, the PMAY aims to provide affordable housing to all eligible beneficiaries. The budget unveiled PMAY Urban 2.0, under which the housing needs of 1 crore urban poor and middle class will be addressed with an investment of Rs 10 lakh crore.The central government’s additional Rs 2.2 lakh crore injection in the next 5 years to make housing more affordable has the potential to revitalise the affordable housing market.Such an approach can play an important role in realising the government's vision of Housing for All and push growth and development. Hence, the significant investment under PMAY Urban 2.0 is expected to alleviate urban housing deficits, spurring construction and economic growth.Steps to introduce technological reforms within the regulatory framework for land, such as digitalisation or GIS mapping of land records, will improve transparency.Rationalisation of stamp duty across states will also be critical to bring in uniformity and initiate land-related reforms such as urban planning, usage and building bylaws.These are steps in the right direction and will boost growth. Moreover, they will improve the ease of property transactions and strengthen municipal finances through increased property taxes. Rationalization of stamp duty with an emphasis on women homebuyers may boost home-buyer sentiment in major cities, too.The budget has also given ample attention to urban and rural development, with rental housing for industrial workers through the public private partnership model, interest subsidies for rental housing, and transit-oriented developments.The proposal to develop investment-ready plug-and-play industrial parks in 100 cities may attract industrial investment, leading to increased demand for industrial real estate and support the growth of ancillary services and residential developments in these regions.Initiatives for industrial parks and rental housing for industrial workers align with the country’s manufacturing goals and addresses worker accommodation needs.These steps are expected to promote industrial growth and stability in labour-intensive sectors, while also creating new opportunities for real estate developers specialising in rental and affordable housing.The changes in long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax, however, have evoked a mixed reaction. The government lowered the long-term capital gains tax from 20% to 12.5%, which is a welcome step. However, this came with the removal of the indexation benefit.The changes could encourage more liquidity in property transactions and potentially increase the effective tax burden depending on the property’s acquisition date.The launch of Phase IV of the PM Gram Sadak Yojana in 25,000 rural habitations will improve connectivity in rural areas, promoting rural development and making these regions more accessible for investment. The primary objective of PMGSY is to build robust, all-weather roads in rural habitations. This initiative focuses on enhancing connectivity and supporting economic development in rural areas.In essence, the budget is geared towards stimulating growth and investment in the real estate sector , fostering a more transparent and investor-friendly environment, and contributing to overall development. It aims to create a balanced and inclusive growth environment by addressing the needs of various segments, including affordable housing, industrial workers and urban infrastructure.The effectiveness of the initiatives, however, hinges on their implementation and continued support of complementary reforms.","Budget 2024-25 is geared towards stimulating growth and investment in the real estate sector.

The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month, as there are concerns that many taxpayers might escape the tax net due to the impending implementation of the new reassessment law on September 1, 2024.According to the amended regulation announced in Budget 2024 , the tax authorities can only go back a maximum of five years to reassess a taxpayer's records if the escaped income is at least Rs 50 lakh, and three years for an amount less than Rs 50 lakh.Previously, they could reassess cases up to 10 years old.According to an ET report, tax officials are now faced with the challenge of compiling and corroborating data on tax and income mismatches for the financial years 2013-14 to 2017-18 within the next few weeks, as these years will become time-barred for reassessment from September 1, 2024.The I-T department relies on information from various sources, such as banks, property registrars, and search findings from the investigation wing, to build reassessment cases.A tax officers' body has raised concerns about the feasibility of issuing notices under Section 148 (or 148A) in a large number of cases within a single month, given the overburdened nature of the jurisdictional assessing officers and the time-consuming process of obtaining sanction from the chief commissioner, who is the specified authority for such notices.Moreover, the law provides taxpayers with the right to explain their position before reassessment orders are finalized, a process that most believe cannot be completed by the end of August.Also Read | ITR refund status for FY 2023-24: How to check income tax refund status online - here’s a step-by-step guide for incometax.gov.in & NSDL websites The Central Board of Direct Taxes ( CBDT ) has been urged by its officers to postpone the effective date of the proposed amendment. However, this suggestion is unlikely to be well-received by corporations and high net worth individuals.""Capping the reassessment period at five years was a great decision as it would reduce hassles and litigation. But if the department fears there could be a genuine loss of revenue as it may not be possible to wrap up several matters by August 31, the government can think of strict parameters where time-bound cases can be selectively reopened - based on trails of steps taken in identifying escaped income,"" said Mitil Chokshi, partner at CA firm Chokshi & Chokshi.""Taxpayers may expect a rush of reassessment notices in August 2024. These notices are likely to be for the AYs 2018-19 and prior to that. It is pertinent to note that the Bombay High Court in a recent ruling in a case of Hexaware Technologies has taken a view on a proviso introduced in 2021, which can be interpreted to mean that AY 2017-18 (and prior years) got time barred on March 31, 2024. These reassessment notices (for AYs 2017-18 and prior) are likely to rake up new interpretation issues in the already muddled reassessment provisions,"" said Ashish Mehta, partner at law firm Khaitan & Co.The current situation is similar to the conflict between the Income Tax office and taxpayers in 2021. The reassessment law was amended in April 2021, allowing the tax office to reopen 10-year-old tax returns if the total undisclosed income exceeded Rs 50 lakh and reassess 4-year-old matters if the amount was less than Rs 50 lakh.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? However, this change led to over 10,000 writ petitions being filed by companies, arguing that they were not given sufficient time to explain and that the notices were issued without considering the carve-out that cases which couldn't be reopened earlier couldn't be reassessed under the new law.The Supreme Court invoked its extraordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution on May 4, 2022, to uphold all reassessment notices issued after March 31, 2021. However, the court left room for judicial proceedings based on the merits of each case, and several such matters are currently pending before the court.","The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month.

Are NPS Vatsalya & hiked NPS deduction limit for private sector employees good moves from Budget 2024?

NPS and EPF: Overlapping services

What is NPS Vatsalaya?

Latest NPS rules, news: In the Union Budget 2024 speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced two new initiatives with regard to National Pension Scheme (NPS) - extension of NPS 14% employer contribution benefits to private setcor and the intended launch of NPS Vatsalya.Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries, bringing it at par with the provisions available for government employees.Sriram Iyer, CEO, HDFC Pension Management told ET that with this move the “ground rules have been harmonised among government and non-government employees, which is a positive step.”Effectively, this means that now, private-sector employees can choose to reduce the taxable portion of employers’ contribution to their NPS corpus, thereby paying less tax and leaving greater funds in their pension deposits.“Employees will benefit from tax savings . More importantly, the 40% increase in contribution will have a significant impact on the terminal value of the retirement corpus,” remarked Iyer. The extended savings will “help in retirement planning, working as an option that is at par with the Provident Fund,” Dinesh Rohira, CEO & Founder, 5nance.com was quoted as saying.Moreover, the endeavour aims to increase NPS penetration by increasing tax incentives for the private sector, providing them a social security-cushion post-retirement.The scheme’s motive to widen the NPS subscriber base may not prove to be flawlessly effective, however. This is explained by Agrees Mrin Agarwal, Founder, Finsafe India: “While it’s good that the limit has been raised, it may not increase adoption as employees need to be educated in a big way. Also, the benefit is only for the salaried opting for the new tax regime,” she says.The mandatory contribution to the EPF, too, threatens to relegate the provisions of NPS under the umbrella of near-superfluity. This sentiment is echoed by Varun Sahay, a software engineer in a Delhi-based IT company: “When 12% of my salary is already deducted for the EPF, why should I put in more in the NPS and cut my take-home pay?”Rohira feels otherwise. “There’s no competition between the NPS and EPF as employees can contribute to both and build a 3-4 times bigger corpus while earning 3-4% higher returns via marketlinked options in the NPS,” he counters.Also Check | New Tax Regime 2023 vs 2024 After Budget: How Much Income Tax Will Salaried Taxpayers Save & How Do New Tax Slabs Compare To Old Regime? Top 10 Points You Must Know To jumpstart retirement savings for children, a new initiative called NPS Vatsalya has been unveiled in the Budget. This scheme allows parents and guardians to contribute to a minor's account, which can be converted into a regular NPS account once the child reaches adulthood.""It provides a very long duration for reaping the compounding benefits and accumulating a huge bounty at a later age. This can be a good way to plan a better future for kids who may not opt for a service segment in the future,"" says Rohira. Sriram Iyer agrees, stating, ""It’s a good move to help the child start his retirement journey. Even if a parent starts when the child is 10 years old, by the time he starts working, it can be a solid foundation for the compounding journey after that.""However, some experts question the utility of a product with such a long lock-in period, especially when parents cannot use the funds for essential goals like their child’s education amidst soaring education costs of 11-12%.""Parents are struggling to save for their own retirement, so it might be a bit of a stretch to expect them to save for their kids’ retirement. The need of the hour is a market-linked product that allows withdrawals only for the child’s education,"" says Mrin Agarwal, Founder of Finsafe India.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? Though the NPS permits partial withdrawals, it allows only 25% of the corpus after three years of joining, and this can be done only three times during the entire tenure. A premature exit before 60 years with 100% withdrawal is only possible if the corpus is less than Rs.2.5 lakh, an amount insufficient for most children's goals.""In its current form, there won’t be any uptake,"" asserts Agarwal. Rohira concurs, ""It’s a vanilla product with a lock-in, which does not make it very attractive and it may not take off. However, the government may optimise it and introduce new features later."" Iyer adds, ""This is just a start and there may be more subscriber-friendly features as we take it to the market. The regulator is proactive and open to feedback.""","Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries.

Gold import duty cut: Why Indians may not find buying gold from Dubai as attractive post Budget 2024,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-import-duty-cut-why-indians-may-not-find-buying-gold-from-dubai-as-attractive-post-budget-2024/articleshow/112097671.cms,"Gold import duty cut in Budget 2024: The recent reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai. Indian jewellers with stores in both India and the UAE believe that the narrowed duty differential will result in lower gold prices in India, making it less attractive for Indians to purchase gold in Dubai.The emirate had attracted gold-enthusiast Indians following a steep rise in customs duty in India in July 2022. In the fiscal 2024-25 budget, the duty on gold imports was more than halved.The duty cut is also expected to boost gold jewellery production in India, particularly the popular 'Kolkatti' jewellery from Kolkata, which is favored by Indian expats in Dubai and tourists from various countries. This move will encourage gold artisans to create new designs in both heavyweight and lightweight jewellery, attracting consumers to purchase gold from India.According to an ET report, Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group , estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India as Indian tourists who previously bought jewellery in Dubai will now prefer to shop in India. However, Indian expats living in Dubai and other customers may continue to buy from the UAE.Also Read | Gold losing sheen? Government cuts gold bond issuance target as investors look at better alternatives Rajiv Popley, director at Popley & Sons, believes that the perception of overseas gold being cheaper than in India is merely a mindset. He points out that the labour cost is significantly lower in India, and with the introduction of mandatory hallmarking and HUID numbers, the purity of gold in India is no longer a concern.Furthermore, NRIs in Dubai do not receive VAT refunds, and Indians travelling abroad only receive about 60% of the VAT back on their gold purchases. Gold trade analyst Bhargav Baidya suggests that the 1% duty differential between gold jewellery in India and Dubai will be offset by Indian jewellers offering discounts to retain and attract customers.Saurabh Gadgil, chairman of PNG Jewellers, notes that Indian import duty is now on par with the US, allowing Indian jewellers to offer competitive prices compared to other countries worldwide. The reduced customs duty is expected to make gold purchases in India more attractive and convenient for Indian consumers, potentially leading to a significant shift in their gold shopping preferences.",The reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai.

Gold losing sheen? The government has reduced its target for issuing gold bonds in the financial year 2024-25 by 38% compared to the previous interim budget goal, according to a senior official. The revised target stands at Rs 18,500 crore, down from Rs 29,638 crore estimated in the interim budget and Rs 26,852 crore (revised estimate) in 2023-24.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told ET ""The decision followed a reassessment of various factors, including investor demand, other investment products and uncertainties around the global economy, as the situation has changed since the interim budget in February.""After accounting for redemptions, the net issuances of sovereign gold bonds are now estimated at Rs 15,000 crore for this fiscal year, a significant decrease from the Rs 26,138 crore projected in the interim budget and Rs 25,352 crore in the revised estimate for 2023-24.Harish Galipelli, director at ILA Commodities India, attributed this shift to retail investors increasingly opting for equities in anticipation of better returns. He also noted that people are uncertain about the potential for further increases in gold prices in the short-to-medium term following a recent rally. Additionally, Galipelli pointed out that savings in rural areas have been impacted by retail inflation and other factors.The gold bond and gold monetisation schemes were introduced by the government in late 2015 to discourage the physical purchase of precious metals and reduce imports, thereby mitigating the negative impact on the current account deficit.The gross collection through these two schemes is now projected to be Rs 20,030 crore in 2024-25, compared to Rs 31,168 crore in the interim budget and Rs 28,240 crore (revised estimate) in the previous fiscal year. Similarly, the net collection is estimated at Rs 16,433 crore, down from Rs 27,571 crore in the interim budget and Rs 26,653 crore in the previous year.

Japanese investors increased their purchases of overseas bonds in the week ended Aug. 17, as diminishing worries about rapid rate hikes by the Bank of Japan soothed concerns over a strengthening yen and its negative impact on carry trades.Investors were also taking advantage of a stronger yen to purchase foreign bonds, following a sharp rally in the currency in the past month, some analysts said.Japanese investors acquired 1.85 trillion yen ($12.72 billion) in long-term overseas bonds during the week, marking their largest weekly net purchase since May 18, data from the Ministry of Finance showed. However, they sold off short-term securities totalling a net 143.9 billion yen.The Bank of Japan's interest rate hike earlier this month strengthened the yen, leading Japanese investors to unwind carry trades in favour of overseas bonds, which offer higher returns versus low interest rates in Japan.""Financial market instability in early August invited criticism that the BOJ was too hasty to hike. Although a large chunk of yen carry trades appears to have been unwound for now, the BOJ may hesitate to hike rates if market instability relapses,"" Oxford Economics said in a note on Thursday.Japanese investors also poured a net 353.2 billion yen into overseas equities, marking the fourth weekly net purchase in five weeks.Meanwhile, data from the Ministry of Finance revealed that foreigners invested 1.53 trillion yen in long-term Japanese bonds last week, the highest weekly amount since May 11. However, they sold short-term instruments totaling a net 1.36 trillion yen, marking the ninth weekly outflow in 10 weeks.In equities, foreign investors withdrew 47.9 billion yen from Japanese shares, following net purchases worth 521.9 billion yen the previous week.Foreigners purchased a net 187.21 billion yen worth of cash equities in the week ended Aug. 16, but sold about 115.13 billion yen in derivatives, marking their fifth consecutive week as net sellers in that segment, data from stock exchanges showed.""With the JPY going back to a more reasonable level and short JPY positions being reduced, the market will focus more on fundamentals (of Japanese equities), said Kelly Chung, chief investment officer, multi assets at Value Partners.",Japanese investors acquired 1.85 trillion yen ($12.72 billion) in long-term overseas bonds during the week.

2024 has been an incredible year for crypto investors, despite the occasional downturns. BTC is predicted to hit $100K toward the end of the year after a much-need price correction. Pro-crypto regulations are on the horizon. More investors are daring to dip their toes into cryptocurrencies for bigger gains. Creative new altcoin projects are exploring the diverse use cases of blockchain .Which altcoins will boom in 2024? Here are the top five crypto picks.There are countless altcoins, but only a few of them are worth watching. Most of these projects are here to pump and dump. These cryptocurrencies have no practical relevance in the eyes of users. That explains why they bite the dust before taking off.Pepe Unchained is an exception. It is one of the few crypto tokens that strike a balance between hype and utility. While Pepe Unchained gives the impression of a meme coin, it is much more than that. First and foremost, Pepe Unchained is building a layer 2 that will make trading smooth and seamless for meme coin users.The Pepe Unchained layer 2 will be launched after the $PEPU presale ends. $PEPU is the native token of the ecosystem. As the name gives it away, it takes inspiration from the meme coin icon Pepe. The clever branding has drawn heavy attention to the $PEPU presale, which broke the $8 million milestone. The Pepe community has expanded to around 10,000 followers on Twitter already.Popular crypto channels like Crypto Gains (135K subscribers) feature the project with an optimistic outlook.Once the presale sells out, investors will have to grab the token for market prices from crypto exchanges. In addition to price discounts, early investors can also grab high staking APYs in the presale. It is a great way to earn passive rewards.Meme coins come and go, but the meme coin market stays in the spotlight. What if a meme coin could give investors exposure to the best of the niche? Crypto All-Stars ($STARS) is about the same.In a revolutionary approach, the project introduces MemeVault—a multichain, multi-token staking protocol designed to generate passive income on popular meme coins. Here, investors can lock in their favourite meme coins in exchange for hefty returns in $STARS tokens.MemeVault does away with juggling multiple staking protocols and brings everything under one seamless platform. In other words, it simplifies the process of earning passive income from meme coins.After a phenomenal start raising over $350K within days, the $STARS presale is moving toward an early sell-out.It’s no wonder there’s so much buzz around the $STARS presale. The growing interest in the project indicates that $STARS could amass a billion-dollar market cap by the end of the year. The unified staking protocol is expected to become a must-have for meme coin investors.Proactive measures like an extensive security audit reassure early investors of the project’s credibility. They are eligible for the best presale deals like higher discounts and staking APYs.Base Dawgz is next, and for obvious reasons. The adventurous Shiba Inu mascot in a Base jumping suit and goggles has gone viral. With Shiba Inu set to pump in the next bull cycle, investors are adding Base Dawgz to balance their portfolios in 2024.Apart from its daring spirit, what sets part Base Dawgz from the crowd of meme coins vying for attention is its multichain infrastructure.“At home on Base Chain, $DAWGZ will also trade on ETH, SOL, BSC and AVAX. We are not just about pushing boundaries; it's about breaking them. We offer seamless interoperability across multiple blockchains, ensuring you can soar through the decentralized world without limits,” notes the website.Base is a growing meme coin hub this year. For example, the Base meme coin Brett has a market cap around $1 billion. Brett investors are diversifying their portfolios to add DAWGZ at presale prices. With each new stage of the presale, the price increases and it has already raised close to $3 million.Avalanche has a higher market cap than the three altcoins mentioned above. It weighs above 7 billion. That doesn’t mean it has saturated, however. After all, the token is still more than 80 percent down from its all-time high. AVAX has been reclaiming its glory over the last few months, despite the frequent downturns.For a better perspective, the crypto coin has surged 50 percent in a year. It is expected to climb further up the charts as the crypto market embraces the bull cycle.AVAX can’t give multifold returns akin to its early days. However, it has the potential to give modest returns to long-term holders if the project successfully builds social momentum. The upcoming rally will set a new support level for AVAX.Increasing competition from the layer one market poses a threat to Avalanche’s road ahead. But the growing ecosystem of DApps and DeFi shows promise for expansion.Chainlink has climbed 25 percent in a year. Does it have more steam left this year? It seems so, thanks to Chainlink’s market relevance. Although LINK has a gigantic market cap above $5 billion, it has the potential to grow bigger. The blockchain abstraction layer that allows universally connected smart contracts has been integral to the market’s growth since 2017.The project allows blockchains to securely interact with external data feeds, events and payment methods. In other words, it expands the horizons of the market into the real world by feeding critical off-chain information. That makes it one of the best altcoins to buy in the high-cap category.A positive price correction is long due for Chainlink. It wouldn’t be surprising to see $LINK touch $20 in the next bull cycle.","2024 has been an incredible year for crypto investors, despite the occasional downturns.

Base Dawgz is the latest meme coin frenzy to grip the market. The brand-new Shiba Inu comes in a Base-jumping space suit to test the adventurous spirit of the market.Investors are scrambling to hoard $DAWGZ tokens in the ongoing presale for heavily discounted prices before it hits the market. The presale is about to rocket past the $3 million milestone.If the growing social media momentum and presale traffic are any sign, Base Dawgz is the next potential 100X meme coin.Meme coins are odd. That, however, doesn’t dampen the fact that they are incredibly entertaining and profitable. After the action-packed reign of Bonk, Dogwifhat, Brett, Pepe, and Mog, Base Dawgz is ready to take over the market.What is driving this craze, and why are investors hoarding $DAWGZ before it has even been listed on exchanges?The fervour can be explained by two primary factors. The first is the unique Shiba Inu avatar that Base Dawgz cleverly embraces. It is the latest Shiba Inu derivative to hit the market. Many successful and ill-fated Shiba Inu derivatives have entered the market in the past, yet, Base Dawgz stands out with a fresh twist.An analysis of the Base Dawgz website and social media pages reveals that it is not another Shiba Inu clone. The allure of the Shiba Inu mascot has played a key role in taking the project to a wide audience. However, what’s urging them to invest in $DAWGZ? This is where the project’s Base label comes into the picture.Base is one of the hot blockchains of 2024. Meme coins, in particular, love it. A few good examples of the Base craze are Brett and Degen, which went on to climb the charts after going viral.In a strategic approach, Base Dawgz has also found its kennel on the Base blockchain . The goal is to tap into the technological prowess of the blockchain, as well as its popularity in the meme coin market.Base stands in stark contrast to bulky and often congested blockchains like Ethereum. It offers a more user-friendly and efficient trading experience, making it an attractive home for new meme coin projects. Lower fees and faster transactions give it a competitive edge, especially in bull markets.Although Base has a significantly smaller ecosystem compared to giants like Ethereum, it’s growing quickly.There are many emerging Base meme coins. What sets apart Base Dawgz in the crowd? The answer is its multichain infrastructure.Although $DAWGZ is native to the Base blockchain, it will be also available on other leading networks like Ethereum, Solana, Binance Smart Chain (BSC), and Avalanche. The multichain ecosystem comes with multiple benefits. First, it helps the token draw liquidity from various on-chain markets. That, in turn, maximises its potential for mass adoption.The ability to operate across multiple blockchains also allows it to stay relevant and tap into different market trends. For example, Base and Solana meme coins were all the rage in the first half of 2024. If another blockchain takes over in the second half, Base will still be able to tap into that. It is positioned to ride the wave.ClayBro recently featured Base Dawgz on his popular YouTube channel with over 130K subscribers, highlighting the multichain infrastructure of the meme coin.A key downside of meme coins investments is the potential dump that follows the pump. One strategy to avoid this is to grab the tokens early. Presales offer an opportunity to get crypto coins at the lowest possible prices before they are available on exchanges.Staking is another method to mitigate the risk of early sell-offs. Countless meme coins are spawned into the market every month but only a few of them manage to succeed.To avoid the tragic fate of the majority, Base Dawgz has implemented a staking programme. It gives investors a way to earn passive income by holding their tokens. The longer the holding period, the higher the rewards. Staking helps stabilise the token’s value and support the project’s long-term journey.In the early phases, presale investors can grab dazzling staking rewards of up to 900 percent. Check out the Base Dawgz white paper for a closer look at the tokenomics and the staking mechanism.No, the Base Dawgz presale is still live for discounted prices. The sell-out could be any day now. Investors should act early to grab the token before its exchange listing.With the Base label and Shiba Inu mascot, Base Dawgz positions itself to capitalise on iconic meme coin trends. The project is amassing large community strength. It has garnered over 5,000 users on X (formerly Twitter) and around 8000 members on Telegram in a short time.","Investors are scrambling to hoard $DAWGZ tokens in the ongoing presale for heavily discounted prices before it hits the market. The presale is about to rocket past the $3 million milestone. If the growing social media momentum and presale traffic are any sign, Base Dawgz is the next potential 100X meme coin.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112678900,imgsize-842209,width-838,resizemode-4/112678900.jpg"

Crypto crashes are scary. They can erase millions overnight. The recent downturn is one of the worst this year, dragging Bitcoin under $60K. Although the market is recovering, most investors remain cautious.However, strategic investors have a reputation for seeking hidden opportunities in crypto crashes. They’re on to securing the next big crypto at the lowest possible prices.And the ongoing dip offers them a chance that is too compelling to ignore. These are the top three cryptos to buy now as prices continue to dump.Meme coin investors are mostly interested in quirky narratives that can go viral than real-world use or practicality. That explains the growing buzz surrounding Base Dawgz – an unabashedly cheerful meme coin. The Shiba Inu mascot with the space-jumping suit is a reflection of the niche’s adventurous spirit.Base Dawgz ($DAWGZ) has already raised over $3 million in its trending presale . Base is a hot meme coin hub in 2024 following the success of projects like Brett and Degen. Being a layer-2 blockchain, Base has the attention of creative new projects seeking efficiency. If Base successfully expands its ecosystem, it has the potential to join the ranks of Solana and Cardano.$DAWGZ eyes a top place on the Base chart, potentially overthrowing giants like Brett. This is because of its multichain infrastructure. In addition to Base, DAWGZ will be available on Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, and BSC. It allows the project to tap into different blockchain strengths, from security to speed and cost efficiency.The presale price increases with each new stage. Investors should act early to grab the token before the next price increase. It is a potential billion-dollar meme coin sensation.Crypto experts have been citing Base Dawgz as the next big meme coin since the presale explosion. For example, top industry publication Cryptonews recently published a wildly optimistic outlook for the new meme coin sensation.The theme, centred around the iconic Shiba Inu, also strengthens the price predictions. The Shiba Inu community is actively looking for new alternatives with increased potential. The Base-jumping coin has inevitably caught their attention, as indicated by the presale FOMO.The staking reward system with three-digit APYs (annual percentage yields) is another factor behind the viral presale craze. The ‘Refer and Earn’ program is live to fuel community activities. The ‘Be Social for Airdrop’ campaign will launch soon.Pepe Unchained holds the second position. The meme coin earned its place on the list with its sizzling hot presale that just surpassed $8.5 million. But that’s not the only reason. Pepe Unchained is one of the most important crypto projects of 2024. Its appeal goes beyond its speculative meme coin packaging with a Pepe label. This is a project with a significant market impact.On the outside, Pepe Unchained is another meme coin vying for attention. Strategic and long-term investors, however, can see beyond. Pepe Unchained is on a mission to establish a thriving meme coin hub. It is launching a layer-two blockchain that promises faster and cheaper transactions. Meme coins built on layer two will be largely immune to network delays and skyrocketing transaction fees.This way, the project tackles network congestion during bull markets. The reliable network addresses the high volatility of meme coins.It goes without saying that the Pepe branding has catalysed the presale FOMO surrounding PEPU. The humorous narrative of Pepe breaking its shackles is a perfect meme coin recipe. Meme coin derivatives are a strong niche, but few have stood the test of time after a few days in the limelight.PEPU doesn’t plan on being another fleeting sensation. Its long-term potential is anchored by the robust layer-two ecosystem. Due to the growing traffic to the presale, the residual FOMO is expected to spark a wild bull run on the token launch. PEPU is predicted to witness a series of price increases after the presale. The increasing adoption of the layer-two ecosystem indicates a steady price growth over time.A lucrative staking reward system adds to its charm. The earlier investors buy the tokens, the higher the discounts and staking APYs.For anyone eyeing a new meme coin with a long-term outlook, Crypto All-Stars ($STARS) presents another compelling option. No, it doesn’t go for any hilarious meme coin themes or absurd narratives.Instead, it focuses on nurturing the market as a whole with its multi-token, multichain staking protocol. How? With MemeVault.The working mechanism of MemeVault is simple. If you are the owner of a diversified meme coin portfolio, you don’t have to juggle multiple staking platforms any more. MemeVault streamlines the process. Here, top meme coins can be staked for attractive returns.The passive income is paid in $STARS tokens, the native crypto of Crypto All-Stars. With its unified staking protocol, the project empowers meme coin investors to maximize their potential returns.In that sense, Crypto All-Stars is a utility-driven altcoin more than a meme coin. That hasn’t stopped speculative investors from hoarding the token in the ongoing presale, however. The attractive presale discounts and staking APYs are too good to pass.The grand welcome of the $STARS presale, raising $300K in the first 72 hours, illustrates the growing FOMO. With each new stage, the presale price increases. But the staking APY doesn’t wait for the next stage. It goes down as more investors join the pool.Crypto All-Stars stands apart from the rest of the crowd, whether it is in theme, narrative, or utility. That underpins its large growth potential as the meme coin market enters another period of heavy volatility.Can Crypto All-Stars become a top meme coin? If the project roadmap and presale FOMO are any indication, yes.",Base Dawgz ($DAWGZ) has already raised over $3 million in its trending presale. Base is a hot meme coin hub in 2024 following the success of projects like Brett and Degen. Pepe Unchained is one of the most important crypto projects of 2024.

Starbucks incoming CEO Brian Niccol to take jet thrice a week to office,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/starbucks-incoming-ceo-to-travel-1600-kms-to-office-via-corporate-jet/articleshow/112675313.cms,"Newly appointed Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol will commute to Starbucks' main office via a corporate jet three times a week. He will not relocate to Seattle headquarters and instead, will live in Newport Beach , California, according to his offer letter disclosed in an SEC filing last week. Under the agreement, Niccol will be paid a base salary of $1.6 million annually, with an opportunity for an annual cash bonus ranging from $3.6 million to $7.2 million, depending on his performance.He will also be eligible for annual equity awards worth up to $23 million.Niccol is not new to negotiating such arrangements; he successfully negotiated a similar deal when he became the CEO of Chipotle in 2018. At that time, Chipotle was headquartered in Denver, Colorado, while Niccol lived in Newport Beach. Three months after Niccol’s appointment, Chipotle moved its headquarters to Newport Beach.Starbucks' offer letter also notes that a remote office and assistant will be set up for Niccol in Newport Beach. Despite his primary residence, Niccol will be expected to work from the Seattle office at least three days a week, per Starbucks' hybrid work policies.“Brian’s primary office and a majority of his time will be spent in our Seattle Support Center or out visiting partners and customers in our stores, roasteries, roasting facilities, and offices around the world,” a Starbucks spokesperson told CNBC Make It. “His schedule will exceed the hybrid work guidelines and workplace expectations we have for all partners.”Starbucks employees have been required to work from the office at least three days a week since early 2023, making this arrangement for Niccol notable. This flexibility highlights the difference in bargaining power between senior-level executives and average employees.Brian R Niccol, a well-known American businessman, is set to become the Chief Executive Officer of Starbucks on September 9, 2024, succeeding Laxman Narasimhan. Niccol, who has made a significant mark on the food industry, previously served as Chairman and CEO of Chipotle, where he'll lead the company until August 31, 2024.","Niccol will be paid a base salary of $1.6 million annually, with an opportunity for an annual cash bonus ranging from $3.6m to $7.2m. He will also be eligible for annual equity awards worth up to $23m. Niccol previously served as Chairman and CEO of Chipotle.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112676942,imgsize-697973,width-400,resizemode-4/112676942.jpg"

Adani has repeatedly denied these claims.Adani Group’s gross debt stood at 2.41 trillion rupees at the end of the quarter.","Billionaire Gautam Adani ’s group said its cash balance accounted for 24.8% of gross debt.

Tackling illicit financial flows – a key area for UN’s tax framework,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/tackling-illicit-financial-flows-a-key-area-for-uns-tax-framework/articleshow/112589917.cms,"MUMBAI: India was among the 110 countries that voted, on Friday, in favour of adopting the ‘ Terms of Reference ‘ for a United Nations (UN) Framework on international tax co-operation .As was reported by TOI earlier, under the UN Framework developing countries – African and Asian countries (including India) are likely to have a greater say in the formulation of global tax rules .In Nov 2022, the UN General Assembly had unanimously adopted a resolution that called for developing an international tax co-operation framework or instrument that is developed and agreed upon through an UN intergovernmental process.The Terms of Reference have now been decided and approved by a UN ad hoc intergovernmental committee. These terms will now be presented to the UN General Assembly in late November or early December, for final approval.A key term of reference which India and several countries wanted on board was addressing tax-related illicit financial flows , tax avoidance , tax evasion and harmful tax practices. Other points of reference are a fair allocation of taxing rights, including equitable taxation of multinational enterprises – which tax experts and government officials view would be favourable to India; addressing tax evasion and avoidance by high-net worth individuals and ensuring their effective taxation in relevant countries; effective mutual administrative assistance in tax matters, including with respect to transparency and exchange of information for tax purposes; and effective prevention and resolution of tax disputes.USA, UK, Canada, Israel, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and Republic of Korea were the eight countries that voted against adopting the Terms of Reference. 44 countries which include Switzerland and primarily various EU countries abstained from voting. The 110 votes in favour are seen as a thumping majority and a clear shift in international tax policy making from the OECD (whose 38 members are dominated by rich nations) to a more broad based and equitable platform of the UN.The Tax Justice Network, a think-tank, has welcomed this development. It had earlier pointed out that OECD-member countries with their territorial dependencies, are estimated to be responsible for nearly 78% of the $ 480 billion in tax losses suffered by countries across the globe. It had added that the world would lose nearly $ 5 trillion to tax havens over the next decade unless the UN tax convention was adopted.","India was among the 110 countries that voted, on Friday, in favour of adopting the ‘ Terms of Reference ‘ for a United Nations (UN) Framework on international tax co-operation.
