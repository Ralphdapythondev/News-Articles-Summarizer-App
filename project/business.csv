India’s stock value tops $5 trillion as Modi’s win powers rally,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/indias-stock-value-tops-5-trillion-as-modis-win-powers-rally/articleshow/111071763.cms,"India’s stock market value exceeded $5 trillion for the first time, with the latest boost coming from a commitment by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s new coalition for policy continuity in the world’s fastest-growing major economy.The country’s equity market has joined the ranks of the US, China, Japan and Hong Kong after topping the threshold last week, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It took India about six months to add the latest $1 trillion to the capitalization of companies listed on its exchanges.Indian stocks have been scaling new peaks since the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party secured sufficient support from key allies to form a coalition government , ensuring Modi’s return to power for a third straight term. The victory, alongside robust economic growth and a recent upgrade of India’s ratings outlook by S&P Global Ratings, are combining to burnish India’s appeal for global investors.The formation of the new government with most key ministers retaining their portfolios “broadly affirms policy continuity,” according to Goldman Sachs strategist Sunil Koul. India remains a market with exceptionally stable macroeconomics and earnings growth is expected to continue, driving stocks higher, Koul said in a Bloomberg Television interview last week.A distinctive feature of gains in recent years has been the extent to which millions of young Indians have taken to equity investments. Local funds, including banks and insurers, have bought more than $26 billion in shares this year, while foreigners offloaded about $3.4 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.“The once dominant foreign institutional investors are no longer the sole drivers of the market,” according to Bino Pathiparampil, head of research at Mumbai-based Elara Capital.Still, off-shore interest have started to return following the outcome of the elections.“There appears ample money on the sidelines waiting to be deployed into India from foreign regional funds and India dedicated funds,” said Chetan Seth, a strategist at Nomura Holdings Inc. “Foreigners have not been able to get enough of India largely due to concerns around valuations and are still underweight.”India’s benchmark NSE Nifty 50 Index closed at a fresh all-time high on Friday and is headed for an unprecedented ninth-straight year of gains.

"Budget 2024 income tax expectations: Modi government may lower personal tax rates, says report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2024-income-tax-expectations-modi-government-may-lower-personal-tax-rates-says-report-top-5-points/articleshow/111058341.cms,"Budget 2024 Income Tax Expectations

The sources told Reuters that a reduction in personal tax could boost consumption and increase savings for the middle class. The first source mentioned that individuals earning over Rs 15 lakh ($17,960.42) annually, up to a certain undetermined amount, may receive some tax relief.

The changes could be made to the new income tax regime introduced in 2020, where annual income up to Rs 15 lakh is taxed at rates between 5% and 20%, while earnings over Rs 15 lakh are taxed at 30%.

The second source pointed out that the personal tax rate increases six-fold when an individual's income rises from Rs 300,000 to Rs 15 lakh, which they described as ""quite steep.""

The government may also consider lowering personal tax rates for annual incomes of Rs 10 lakh, according to the first source. They added that a new threshold is being discussed for income taxed at the highest rate of 30% under the old tax system.

The second source noted that any loss of tax income to the government through tax cuts could be partially offset by increased consumption from this category of income earners.

Budget 2024 income tax expectations: The Modi government is mulling over the possibility of reducing personal tax rates for specific groups of individuals, according to two government sources who spoke to Reuters. This move has the potential to stimulate consumption in India, which is the third-largest economy in Asia.The sources, who requested anonymity due to the confidential nature of budget discussions, indicated that the plan might be unveiled in July when Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman presents the first Union Budget following the Modi 3.0 government.Also Check | Income Tax Slabs FY 2024-25 Explained: New Tax Regime Vs Old Tax Regime - What are the tax rates, slabs & surcharge rates?

Snowflake’s taking AI to where data resides: CEO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/snowflakes-taking-ai-to-where-data-resides-ceo/articleshow/110955730.cms,"It has been about four years since Snowflake entered the Indian market. How has the journey been so far?

How has the rise of GenAI impacted cloud-based data storage and analytics service businesses?

You have just announced Snowflake Cortex Analyst and Cortex Search…

Where else do you see Gen AI having an impact?

You say that Snowflake LLM Arctic with its mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture allows AI models to be built faster and at a fraction of the cost of traditional methods. How does it do this?

How do you see the adoption of Gen AI-based products in enterprises?

SAN FRANCISCO: “We receive five billion queries on our Data Cloud every day,” says Sridhar Ramaswamy, CEO of Snowflake, the cloud-based data platform that provides data storage, processing, and analytics solutions. The number is significant, considering Google receives an average of 8.5 billion search requests every day. Ramaswamy was speaking at the firm’s ‘Snowflake Summit 2024’ in San Francisco earlier this week, where the company announced a slew of new technologies that “take AI to where data resides”. The company also announced a tie up with Nvidia that will allow Snowflake customers and partners to build AI-powered applications. Ramaswamy, an IIT Madras alumnus who was in Google for over 15 years and who was appointed CEO of Snowflake in Feb, spoke to TOI on the sidelines of the summit. Excerpts:Snowflake operates in two buckets in India. One is with India-based customers like Swiggy, Urban Company, and Piramal Capital, so they can unlock the full value of their data. The second pertains to the trend of American companies moving their core infrastructure to India. We are investing heavily in having a presence in India, in training more people on Snowflake. Companies like Morgan Stanley, for example, have their very senior staff in India taking care of data operations using Snowflake. We have close to 500 people in our Pune centre of excellence, and a lot more expansion is to come.Generative AI is going to have an impact from bottom to top in the stack. For example, there’s a Snowflake feature that transcribes videos, and after indexing the text, you can create a chatbot based on it. And the thing that people are most excited about is that instead of getting a bunch of links, you get answers. We also help them get grounded, cited answers, so that they know where the answers are coming from. Our value prop at Snowflake is to create a single unified product, where things like AI are tightly integrated, and we see ourselves as more an AI Data Cloud.Cortex Analyst is a bit of a North Star for the business analytics area — it will let a business user talk to their data and get answers back. If a business user asks an unreasonable question, the product will say ‘no’. As soon as you give people a chatbot, they start asking ridiculous things like ‘what is my revenue going to be 15 years from now’. A piece of SQL is certainly not going to give you that information. I generally see AI as an enhancer for data access and visualisation. Cortex Analyst is all about asking natural language questions of structured data. Cortex Search is about getting documents indexed so that you can create a chatbot very easily.In cleaning data, for instance. Data has always been messy. There’s no magic wand making sure that you have clean data. For example, think about all the documents that you have consumed. Whenever you search, for example, you are going to run into outdated documents. Making sure that these are marked as outdated or updated will be an ongoing event. We see language models helping with several of these problems. Companies currently spend millions of dollars every year just on data engineering – for cleaning up data, and getting it into a good place.Just like standard AI models, MoE is a stack of parameters, one on top of each other. There are often 24 to 32 layers of neurons that are different kinds of behaviour and connections. In dense models like GPT-3, when a new token (unit of input like a word, an image, etc) comes in for training, it ends up affecting every parameter (GPT-3 has approximately 175 billion parameters) at every layer. For instance, you take a sentence, mask a word in it, and ask the model to predict the word by feeding this sentence in. In the process, every token ends up affecting all parameters and this just makes it computationally expensive to update the model to train on a large amount of data. With MoE, you do an arbitrary subdivision of the token space and, during training, you will have portions of the neural network that get activated for different buckets of tokens (instead of having to impact all the parameters). So, you end up constructing models that are a combination of dense networks that are activated for every token, and sparse experts that are activated only partially. Now, this process can end up producing models that are almost as good as the dense models, but for a smaller amount of compute. And, you can train models faster and more efficiently.Canva, Zoom and Bayer and many others are harnessing Cortex AI to create applications and drive productivity. We have several hundred others building applications to talk to their enterprise data with natural language for business-critical decision making.","Sridhar Ramaswamy is CEO of Snowflake, a cloud-based data platform that provides data storage, processing, and analytics solutions.

Simplify rate structure, include informal economy in tax ambit: Tax experts

Experts suggest that India can lower taxes, maintain a low tax to GDP ratio, and enhance tax collection by bringing the informal sector into the tax ambit. Reforms in direct taxes are crucial to achieve a $25 trillion GDP by 2047.

NEW DELHI: As GST completes seven years, taxpayers have demanded rationalisation of rates, faceless dealing with authorities and an amnesty scheme , a survey by a leading consulting firm showed.“Rationalising GST rate across sectors, with a focus on removing inverted duty structure,” is the top demand when it comes to structural changes for GST 2.0, the survey conducted by Deloitte showed. GST Council is due to meet on Saturday where several issues are likely to be taken up.Rate rationalisation, including a reduction in the number of slabs, has been on the agenda for years but the Centre and the states have been postponing the decision as it will entail an increase in rates on some of the goods and services as the 12% and 18% slabs are likely to be merged around 16-17%. Higher rates on several products may be politically sensitive, the ministers have feared. Correcting the inverted duty structure — where finished products attract lower levies than the inputs — is something that is easier to address.The survey covering 760 respondents across small and big businesses also drew attention to the problems that tax audits are posing across segments and pointed to multiple such actions by state and central authorities. It also underlined the need to remove restrictions on use of input tax credits, which had been imposed due to frauds that came into focus. Some businesses have also sought steps, that will help reduce the working capital that gets locked up under the current system.Taxpayers also called for an amnesty scheme to resolve disputes that have come up in the last seven years, some of which are technical in nature.","GST Council is set to meet on June 22, the first meeting in eight months after the NDA govt returned to office.

The finance minister set the stage for a ""Viksit Bharat by 2047"", on the core principles of ‘Sabka Saath’, ‘Sabka Vikas’, ‘Sabka Vishwas’, with ‘Sabka Prayas’ being added as a new theme in the interim Budget.This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data i.e., farmer welfare and N for Nari utthan i.e., support for women entrepreneurs. These form the pillars of a comprehensive inclusive development. The Government's commitment to sustainable development under the strategy for Amrit Kaal includes achieving 'Net Zero' by 2070, rooftop solarization for one crore households and robust health initiatives.The Indian economy's resilience takes center stage amidst positive indicators of declining current account deficit as a percentage of GDP, falling unemployment rates, and a notable rise in digital transactions. These statistics affirm the robustness of the economy, showcasing a trajectory of growth and stability.The achievements in taxation reforms are nothing short of remarkable, with direct tax collections more than trebling in the last decade, the number of tax return filers increasing by 2.4 times, average processing time of tax returns plummeting from 93 days in FY 2013-14 to an impressive 10 days in FY 2023-24, resulting in issuance of quick refunds. These are the results of consistent progressive measures thus obviating the need for, and rightly avoiding, any last-minute populist measures.No change in existing tax rates, both for direct and indirect taxes, is a good indicator of stability and predictability for investors and taxpayers.A welcome move to waive outstanding tax demands that are minor, disputed, and unreconciled. This involves the withdrawal of outstanding direct tax demands up to Rs. 25,000 pertaining to the period up to FY 2009-10 and up to Rs.10,000 for FY 2010-11 to 2014-15.The Government's commitment to fostering a business-friendly environment is evident in its intent to extend specific tax benefits for start-ups, investments by sovereign wealth funds/ pension funds, and certain IFSC units. The extension has been made now until March 31, 2025. This might help in creating a conducive landscape for business.To align with the CBDT notification issued earlier, the provisions relating to tax collection at source concerning remittances under the Liberalized Remittance Scheme have now been formally incorporated in the Finance Bill, 2024, setting the rate at 20% for amounts exceeding Rs. 7 lakhs in a financial year.The Finance Bill, 2024 proposes an extension of the time limit for introducing the faceless scheme by the Central Government for transfer pricing proceedings, DRP Proceedings, and ITAT Proceedings, up to March 31, 2025.The interim Budget 2024 may not have proposed significant tax announcements, but it very well positioned the prelude to the full budget post the upcoming elections. Considering the potential impact on the population across the four pillars of GYAN, a sizable portion of India stands to be covered. The interim Budget’s focus on the tax front resembles a report card, highlighting the maturity achieved by our tax system. The enhancement of taxpayer services was emphasized as a key priority.","This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data and N for Nari utthan.

Interim Budget for a Viksit Bharat: It’s for everyone and all,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/interim-budget-for-a-viksit-bharat-its-for-everyone-and-all/articleshow/107497439.cms,"By Akhilesh Tuteja

The Finance Minister on February 01, 2024, delivered a truly innovative interim budget. At first glance, it did not seem like an interim budget but looked more like the budget to drive further growth and a continuum of inclusive growth-oriented investments.At the outset, this budget brings a wonderful balance between fiscal prudence and continued investment for growth. It's not easy to continue the glide path of reducing the fiscal deficit and continuing to make significant investments in all areas including infrastructure, R&D, energy transition, technology, skilling, and social welfare. The surprising reduction in fiscal deficit of 5.8% as against the budgeted 5.9% for FY24 and the projection of 5.1% in FY25 with a clear focus on increasing investments was a huge positive.This was a budget for everyone and all because it caters to every part of the Indian economy and society. The FM has carefully catered to the investment needs of various sectors. The continued focus on youth, impoverished, women and farmers to increase their involvement and contribution to economic growth is evident. By committing an 11.1% increase in capital expenditure to 11,11,111 lakh crore, the FM has clearly brought every single 1 in this growth journey.What was very impressive was the inclusion strategy of the government. The focus on women's empowerment for the past few years is unprecedented, which is reflected in the inclusion of women in the workforce moving from 23.3% to 37% in the last five years. The thirty crore Mudra Yojna loans to women entrepreneurs were a great boost to the Nari Shakti initiative. We already have over 10 million Lakhpati Didis and what is truly evident is like a corporate CFO, the FM has revised the earlier target of 20 million Lakhpati Didis to 30 million. The government also plans to invest in initiatives to encourage young girls between the ages of 9 and 14 to undertake the vaccination for cervical cancer which is again a great boost to Nari Shakti.A lot needs to be done to bring more women into all parts of economic growth but the journey so far and the vision of the future is truly inspiring.While India continues on its technological prowess and makes its mark in new technologies like Artificial Intelligence, we need a multi-pronged strategy to harness the power of AI. We need a clear focus on building AI systems in India so that we not only emerge as a global leader in this new era but can build models, which are specific to India that will benefit Indians. At the same time, we need a very wide coverage program to build skills to leverage AI to its fullest potential. The biggest contribution we can make to the inclusion of youth in the economic development of the country is by skilling them in new skill areas. In the last few years, the Skill India Mission has trained 14 million youth, reskilled over 5 million youth and established a staggering 3,000 new ITIs. The future of any country will depend as much on capital investments as on skill investments.The focus on agricultural development and support to the farmer continues through direct financial assistance to farmers. The farmers have benefited by getting crop insurance through PM Fasal Bima Yojana. It's not just the farmers, the PM-SVANidhi provides credit assistance to a large number of street vendors.The last few years have seen the journey of affordable housing through Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY). There is a slight increase in allocation to launch a scheme for encouraging the middle class to build or buy new homes. This investment will likely propel a wider economic development and increase employment.India has seen a tremendous rise in entrepreneurship in the last few years. In order to continue the journey and promote new startups, the government proposes to extend certain tax benefits, which are expiring from March 2024 to March 2025. The MSMEs have not been left behind. With a proposal to provide timely finances to such enterprises, the government has paved the way for their growth, so they can look to compete globally.All in all, it’s a truly inclusive budget with a clear focus on development not just by giving away freebies but enabling the people to participate in the economic development activity. While the FM calls the comprehensive GDP - Governance, Development & Performance – to me, this budget is inclusive of another GDP – gender, demography, and professions.","Akhilesh Tuteja is Partner and Head, Clients and Markets, KPMG in India.

‘Enough domestic sources of demand to counter drag from external sector’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/enough-domestic-sources-of-demand-to-counter-drag-from-external-sector/articleshow/107372012.cms,"Do you think the

creates room for lower interest rates?

One of the issues that the Budget has flagged is the demographic challenge and opportunity and the societal change that is taking place. How do you view this?

Niti Aayog is working on the Viksit Bharat roadmap. What will be the focus areas?

You are as much a representative of the Centre as well as the states. Is it time to revisit the entire formula for transfers to states particularly on the issue of cesses and surcharges?

Suman Bery , who heads Niti Aayog , the govt think tank, is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China, which he says is also an opportunity for India. The economist is confident that Indian states remain resilient. Excerpts of the interview with TOI.The finance ministry expects the economy to grow 7% next year. Given the global situation, how do you see the prospects?The belief in the finance ministry is that we have a possible drag coming from the external sector but that we have other sources. We have enough domestic sources of demand. One has to applaud the political and economic judgment of FM in deciding that it was appropriate to pursue the path of fiscal consolidation. There is transparency. What this actually reflects is responsible economic management, which is one reason we are where we are. Second, it also creates a buffer so that there is policy space if we do encounter headwinds.That’s the hope and expectation. We have an independent central bank and an inflation targeting central bank, so it is up to the monetary policy committee to take a call through the monetary policy committee on the repo rate .The PM has said that when India grows its states grow. India is a composite of 37 states and UTs. They are each at very different points in their demographic transition. There are some states where the net replacement rate is down to 1%, like Kerala . There are others, particularly UP and Bihar, which are in their earliest stage of demographic transition and each one of these states is the size of a large European country. There are two implications of that — one is internal labour mobility and it will become an even larger part of our growth model. The govt has taken several steps to create a unified market. Our main endowment is our human capital and that has to be equipped to participate in global exchange in many ways. We know from China, Japan that the demographic dividend partly depends on markets and on human capital. But the golden period is fairly short lived, about 15 years, when the so called dependency ratio declines. The other big opportunity the PM has been highlighting is bringing women much more into the active labour force.When Niti was set up there was the idea of a three-year vision and a seven-year strategy paper. The reality is that schemes of govt tend to be aligned with the award of the Finance Commission . There are various established building blocks or hand holds which are already a matter of govt policy. The PM is much more interested in a national debate on what it means to be a Viksit Bharat or modern society. We have a collective goal and it is for the democratic polity to define what that goal should be. Its emphatically not for a super mandarin bureaucracy. It is not going to be Lee Kwan Yew’s Singapore led from the top.It’s entirely a finance ministry matter but I would be lying if I didn’t say when I visit certain states there is this complaint. A big frontier would be resource mobilisation at the state level. Second is going to be rationalisation of subsidies not only at the Union level, but also at the state level. All chief ministers sit on my governing council. When they convene as the governing council, I see them in their role as development practitioners. The world is beginning to appreciate quite how much institutional and political maturity India attained in our 75 years and the most fundamental dimension of a democracy, we have orderly transfers of power. There are enough buffers to ensure that what happens in state finances is unlikely to create macro instability. Those risks are well contained by our Constitution. The chief ministers know that they are going to be judged by development outcomes and so you can have the sugar rush of changing of pension plans or various handouts but if the cupboard is bare you are not going to be able to deliver.","Suman Bery is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China.

Government's Marathon to 2047: Emphasis on Fiscal Prudence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/governments-marathon-to-2047-emphasis-on-fiscal-prudence/articleshow/107371788.cms,"What was the thinking behind keeping the vote on account absolutely straight?

So is it the idea to keep the Budget completely transparent?

The capex has risen 11.1% and there is an emphasis on infrastructure spending. But there is also the hope that the private sector will now take over and start capital spending. Given the geopolitical situation, how confident is the govt that it will pan out as planned?

Finance secretary T V Somanathan, in an interview with TOI, says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047 . Excerpts:If you see the Budget speech you will see the emphasis on 2047. The govt has set its sight on running that marathon. Running to 2047 is a marathon , it’s not a sprint. If you are going to run a marathon, you need to be in good shape and you can’t have short-term stimulants or something that will get you some yards and then it’s done.The whole focus is on making India a developed country by 2047, for which a healthy present and a strong fiscal position is an important concomitant. Some purely short term measures don’t really fit into that picture. It’s a consistent picture: focus on the long term for which you need to build strength in the short term and that needs to be done by prudence in fiscal policy and by not doing things which can detract you from that path. Not doing the wrong thing is more important than appearing to do things.The idea is that govt finances may be good, bad or indifferent depending on the times, depending on the circumstances, depending on the policies. But what is the position should be reflected as reasonably and accurately as possible. That is an emphasis. As regards the Finance Commission, again the terms of reference that have been given to them are the terms in the Constitution.What is the means by which the devolution should be done is a matter they have full discretion. They can actually take all kinds of factors into account and in a sense we felt this time based on my review of the previous commissions that the right expression would be less is more. The shorter, less prescriptive terms of reference gives full scope for all stakeholders including state govts to express their viewpoints and for the commission to take a balanced view of the different perspectives and then come to its award. Ultimately the award of the Finance Commission is about devolution and grant for which full scope has now been given to them.n There are incipient signs of private capital expenditure accelerating. There are some surveys I have seen done by some of the chambers industry, which show high levels of investment. The PMI, which is a sort of leading indicator, is also looking pretty healthy. Capacity utilisation is one reason that private sector capital expenditure doesn’t immediately pick up when the economy starts accelerating because there is surplus capacity.But increasingly I get the sense that many industries are beginning to reach levels where they have to add capacity. When that happens capital investment will happen. Another pointer also mentioned in the Budget speech you may notice that our airlines have placed large orders for planes — that is capital expenditure.When you import 1,000 aircraft, it’s just not 1,000 aircraft, there are concomitant additions to ground handling facilities, you need airports to expand, you need to employ people to do that. That means a lot of jobs. The aircraft is capital but then look at the effect it is going to have on skilled jobs. So capital expenditure is happening. I am fairly confident that we will have decent capital expenditure in the year to come and that will become a new source of acceleration.",Finance secretary T V Somanathan says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047. The capex has risen 11.1% and there is an emphasis on infrastructure spending.

Income Tax Changes Budget 2024 : In the recent Budget 2024 speech, the Finance Minister kept the Section 80C tax deduction limit unchanged. The maximum limit for claiming tax benefits under Section 80C remains at Rs 1.5 lakh for the current fiscal year 2023-24 and will stay the same for individuals looking to save on taxes through Section 80C investments in the upcoming fiscal year 2024-25.Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions. Individuals can reduce their gross taxable income by up to Rs 1.5 lakh per financial year by engaging in these specific investments or expenditures.You can save on taxes through Section 80C by investing in things like Employees' Provident Fund (EPF), Public Provident Fund (PPF), Equity Linked Saving Scheme (ELSS) mutual funds, National Savings Certificate (NSC), and 5-year tax-saving fixed deposits with banks or post offices. Additionally, paying life insurance policy premiums also qualifies for tax benefits under Section 80C.It is important to note that each eligible investment comes with its specific maximum limit, rate of return, liquidity, and taxation rules for the earned returns, states ET in a report. For instance, the most you can invest in PPF in a financial year is Rs 1.5 lakh. Meanwhile, there's no limit on the amount you can invest in ELSS mutual funds, but the Section 80C deduction is capped at Rs 1.5 lakh.If individuals can't make specific investments, they can still get deductions under Section 80C from their gross taxable income through certain expenses. These expenses include repaying the principal amount of a home loan, tuition fees for children, payment of stamp duty, registration fees, and other costs related to buying a house.Since the financial year 2020-21, individuals without any business income must annually choose between the old and new tax regimes. As of the fiscal year 2023-24, the new tax regime is the default option.

While prediction of normal monsoon rains may augur well for crops and improve supplies, the impact of weather related shocks needs close monitoring.""As long as food price pressures persist, however, the goal of aligning inflation with its target remains a work in progress,"" according to the RBI document. The central bank has a target of keeping inflation at 4% (plus/minus 2%).Latest data showed retail inflation, as measured by the consumer price index (CPI), slowed to a 12-month low of 4.8% in May. Vegetables and pulses prices remained under pressure while core inflation which is estimated after stripping out food and fuel was steady at 3.1%. Food inflation remained unchanged at 7.9%.The central bank said the prospects for agriculture are brightening with early landfall of southwest monsoon.

GST hike has crippled biz of real-money gaming cos: USISPF-EY Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gst-hike-has-crippled-biz-of-real-money-gaming-cos-usispf-ey-report/articleshow/111120613.cms,"NEW DELHI: Against attracting strong investments of around $2.6 billion from domestic and foreign funds, inflows into the real-money gaming category have completely dried up after govt’s decision to mandate a 28% GST on full face value of player collections from Oct 2023, leading to a situation of job losses , revenue stagnation , and high taxes, the US-India Strategic Partnership Forum (USISPF) and EY said in a representation to govt.Dealmaking in the industry has also come to a halt, and there are some companies that have shut down operations or have scaled down massively, the report said, adding that illegal operators have sprung up to dodge high-tax formal set-ups.“… only a handful of entities remain profitable and are surviving at lower margins compared with the October 1, 2023 scenario. Post GST amendment, most companies have either turned into loss-making entities or are bleeding capital. Few have highlighted that they will need to move out of the sector and the rest are considering taking the business to another country if taxes are not normalized,” USISPF-EY said, adding,“no capital has been raised in the sector since October 1, 2023.”Companies have been reporting a challenging financial position after the change in taxation, and argue that maintaining operations has become difficult. “Overall, India has the most onerous and highest indirect taxation regime for online skill gaming. Most countries globally tax on GGR (gross gaming revenue)/platform fees, which are the actual revenue for the platforms for the service they provide. In limited cases where countries levy indirect taxes on deposits, the tax rate is lower to maintain parity with GGR models and not burden the sector with unduly heavy tax liability,” the report said.Jobs have also been hit due to the squeeze in funding and fall in revenues. “Decreased margins due to increased GST (being absorbed by the companies) had a ripple-down effect in employee layoffs and a complete pause in hiring specialist skills such as technology, product, animation, and design. Most companies have reported impacted jobs in terms of no hiring, layoffs, and shutting down operations altogether,” USIPF-EY said. “The new GST regime has created concerns around the viability of the sector and is keeping away the right talent from joining the workforce, further exacerbating the sector’s woes.”The report said the GST Council should look at amending the valuation mechanism for online money games to levy GST from the current “full-face value of total deposits” to GGR/platform fees mode.The report also said gamers are moving to illegal, offshore platforms to avoid paying high taxes which is also resulting in less collections for govt. “The increase in GST cost will lead customers to move towards alternative options such as offshore or illegitimate platforms which do not charge GST or impose lower rates, resulting in an increase in gambling addiction, fuelling of the offshore market, and loss of revenue for the exchequer.”","The real-money gaming category has completely dried up after govt’s decision to mandate a 28% GST on full face value of player collections from Oct 2023.

But Tata Power on Wednesday integrated the 4DX cinema technology to create a first of its kind safety training modules at its Salsette receiving station in Bhandup -- to sensitise engineers and other technical staffers on real life scenarios where a small mistake on their part could cost their lives.Those undergoing the training are supposed to sit in this mini-theatre for 30 minutes to an hour wherein they fasten their seatbelts and watch a show on safety at the workplace. It has several modules on screen -- one of them being excavating the road and how lack of preventive measures can lead to electrocution injuries or death.The moment there is rain on screen, there is water sprinkled on the face and clothes of those inside the theatre. And when the ""reel life"" engineer makes a mistake while handling electrical equipment and gets electrocuted, the audience seat keeps rocking and there is smoke, lights and air blown on his face to give it a dramatic effect.""We are just giving a message to our staffers undergoing the training that once electrocuted, there is no coming back. Its better to experience the worst case scenario on a 4DX platform and ensure that nobody makes a single mistake at work ever,"" an official said, adding that the objective was to save lives as less than 1% workers had faced burns/electrocution issues in the past.The training modules have been designed on three aspects -- excavation safety procedure, working at height (transmission towers) procedure and electrical safety procedure. Apart from 4DX, there is also a separate Virtual Reality (VR) room wherein you put in the headset and are virtually transported to a real-life working environment and your skills are tested for safety.Tata Power president (T&d) Sanjay Banga said, ""The 4D experience and Virtual Reality (VR) centres are a quantum leap when it comes to safety training in the power sector. Here, with its immersive simulations, our engineers and linemen don’t just learn—they live through scenarios, anticipate challenges, and hone their safety instincts. As India moves towards 500 GW of clean energy target by 2030, power transmission infrastructure will play a critical role in the evacuation of the generated green power. With this facility and our engineering prowess, we plan to champion Tata Power’s ‘Zero Harm’ culture and establish a pioneering standard in the power transmission space.""","Tata Power has integrated the 4DX cinema technology to create a first of its kind safety training modules at its Salsette receiving station in Bhandup.

Tanvi, who initially thought she was seeing things, was horrified to discover the snake firmly attached to the tape, unable to move but very much alive. Thankfully, the sticky situation prevented the cobra from causing harm.

The moment Tanvi (@Tanvxo) posted her unnerving experience on social media, the story went viral. Netizens were quick to mock Amazon for what seemed like a literal interpretation of their name, while others raised serious concerns about the company’s packaging protocols.

Aditya Kumar Trivedi, an X user with the handle @adityasvlogs, humorously commented, ""If you order from Amazon, sometimes they send products from their forests as well. Anyway, I have heard that the Amazon forest is very large.”

Yatharth (@CastePatroller) added to the hilarity, tweeting, “Looks like Amazon took their name a bit too literally this time. Instead of a controller, you got a whole wildlife adventure!”

Meanwhile, Rahul Dev (@meetrahuldev) drew a comical parallel with a tweet, “When you receive your X in the box”, cleverly linking the Xbox to the unexpected reptilian guest.

Adding to the fun, user Aryabhata speculated that Tanvi might have opted for the ""Cobra Kai"" game to go with her new controller.

The incident has sparked a flurry of memes and jokes but also highlighted the potential risks associated with packaging and delivery processes. Amazon has yet to respond to the uproar.

It can be at your house; it can sort of babysit your kids and teach them. It can do factory stuff.”Musk also said that Tesla is already using Optimus robots in the production of its electric cars. “We have two Optimus robots in our Fremont factory that are doing basically…taking cells off the end of the line and placing them in a shipping container. We actually have quite a few of these cruising around our offices in Palo Alto,” he said.The billionaire did a little jig as he came on stage with many shareholders rising to their feet and shouting ‘Musk, Musk’. Every major pronouncement by him was met with loud applause, drowning out criticism by some of Musk’s huge pay package that came up for voting.Musk predicted that everyone in the world is going to want the AI-powered humanoid robots when they release, and that the demand could push Tesla’s valuation to $25 trillion. “I think we could make one for a cost, at a really high scale, of about $10,000. It’d be less expensive than a car. And I think if you sell it for $20,000 or something, this is at large-scale volume, Tesla would basically make about a trillion dollars of profit a year from that.” Though no exact release dates were given, Musk did say they plan to move into limited production by the end of next year and that thousands of these robots could be working at Tesla’s factories by then.Aside from robots, Musk was also bullish on fully unsupervised autonomous vehicles and claimed that autonomous driving technology is maturing so fast that car owners of the future may be able to send their cars out to work for them.“It’s actually a combination of Airbnb and Uber to some degree, so there’ll be some cars that Tesla owns itself, kind of like an Uber fashion, but then for the fleet that is owned by our customers, it will be like an Airbnb thing where you can add or subtract your car to the fleet whenever you want. So, in case you’re going away for a week, at just one tap on your Tesla app, your car gets added to the fleet and it just makes money for you while you’re gone,” he said.","Musk said Tesla’s Optimus robot, first announced in 2021, is a humanoid robot that is intended to be able to do anything you want it to do. “I think we could make one for a cost, at a really high scale, of about $10,000.

The crypto market is in a sea of red. Meme coins are no exception.As always, strategic investors have turned to crypto presales. The PlayDoge ($PLAY) presale soared past $4.6 million on Monday in response to the growing traffic.Investors are seeking refuge in the play-to-earn meme coin . Since the presale is available at fixed discounted prices now, $PLAY is immune to the ongoing crash.Amid a crowd of meme coins, why does PlayDoge have the spotlight? Here is an analysis.The fixed discounted pricing is not the only reason why PlayDoge is trending.If that were the case, there are many cryptocurrencies currently in the presale phase. But they haven’t amassed $4.6 million like PlayDoge.There are multiple factors behind PlayDoge’s viral presale success.PlayDoge is a new gaming token that revives the Tamagotchi trend of the 90s. $PLAY will be used as the payment and reward token in the virtual pet Doge game.The nostalgic meme coin taps into two sensational phenomena – Tamagotchi of the video gaming market and Doge of the meme coin market. The result is explosive, as the rapid progress of the PlayDoge presale shows.In a market full of Doges, PlayDoge establishes a distinct identity with this strategic style.Speculative investors and degens are piling in to secure $PLAY tokens at low prices before its exchange launch.Although the meme coin market is lukewarm this week, the broader market is predicted to rebound in a few days. The $PLAY exchange launch is likely to align with the next market pump.The X community of PlayDoge has grown to 4734 users over the last few days. Given that the page was launched only in May, the growth is an indicator of the rising FOMO . The PlayDoge community on Telegram is also on its way to 5000 members.The built-in staking protocol maximises the reward potential of investors. 116M $PLAY tokens have already been locked up. The staking APY stands at a compelling 162% now.Top crypto analysts and YouTubers like Crypto Mischief have catalysed the buying frenzy. Top crypto education platform 99Bitcoins (706K subscribers) recently featured PlayDoge with a bullish outlook, adding to the FOMO.PlayDoge is a meme coin. But it doesn’t conform to the established meme coin standards.It has play-to-earn utilities inside the much-awaited Tamagotchi-style game. Gamers can play various 2D adventures, journey through the charming 8-bit universe, and rack up points.Those who climb to the top of the leaderboards will earn more points. The rewards are paid in $PLAY tokens, which have real value on crypto exchanges.In other words, PlayDoge is not another meme coin designed to pump and dump. The strong relevance of the project gives it long-term potential. With a focus on quality and utility, it is marking a radical shift in the meme coin market.The games are inspired by the nostalgic 90s craze: Tamagotchi virtual pets, with over 82 million units sold since 1996. Although the theme made a comeback during the pandemic, its full potential remains to be unlocked.In true Doge fashion, PlayDoge taps into the craze.In the PlayDoge mini-games, players will feed, train, and care for their pets, ensuring they stay happy and healthy. Virtual pet games encourage long-term investments.PlayDoge will be available for Android and iOS users through the Google Play Store and the App Store. Due to the proven popularity of both niches, it could potentially attract millions of users over the coming years.The games will be a fun source of income for even gamers who don’t have much gaming experience. More than gaming expertise, consistency will be key to reaping rewards on the platform.The gaming activity will influence the price trajectory of $PLAY, as it happens in the case of most play-to-earn coins. The rising number of active players on PlayDoge will pump the demand for $PLAY tokens.The total meme coin market cap is down to $50 billion, with almost all tokens crashing. One of the few exceptions to the trend is PlayDoge.With high-cap meme coins facing fierce selling pressure, investors are seeking haven in emerging projects like PlayDoge that remain shielded from the crash.Due to the low initial market cap, $PLAY leaves a large room for returns when compared to the high-cap saturated projects. The market is expected to reverse the trend soon, since there is no obvious catalyst for the downturn.On its launch, PlayDoge is predicted to pump like Floki Inu––the play-to-earn meme coin known for the Valhalla game.The $PLAY presale is moving toward an early sell-out due to the growing traffic. Investors can join the presale using ETH, USDT, and fiat cards now.With each new stage, the presale price increases and the staking rewards decline, encouraging early investments and positioning PlayDoge as a meme coin to watch as we head into the summer.",PlayDoge is a new gaming token that revives the Tamagotchi trend of the 90s. $PLAY will be used as the payment and reward token in the virtual pet Doge game. 116M $PLAY tokens have already been locked up. The staking APY stands at a compelling 162% now.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111112338,imgsize-208777,width-838,resizemode-4/111112338.jpg"

The Sealana ($SEAL) craze is mounting to new heights.Although Bitcoin is down to $65K and Ethereum has been struggling to get past $4000, this new Solana meme coin is blazing hot. The viral presale of $SEAL tokens stands in stark contrast to the lacklustre performance of the broader meme coin market .Degens and strategic investors are hoarding $SEAL tokens in the sensational presale, scheduled to end on 25 June 2024 at 6 PM UTC.We have seen plenty of dog coins enter the meme coin market over the last many years. They emerge, trend, and then fade into obscurity.Apart from rare exceptions like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Floki Inu, few have managed to withstand the test of time. In the meme coin market, it is hard to establish an identity.Sealana boldly shatters these norms.To begin with, it is not a dog coin. Yes, ‘dog coin’ is a highly potent label that could instantly draw traction. But it also stands in the way of building a distinct identity.So, Sealana is a seal-themed mascot. It comes forward with an intriguing narrative. If the meme coin bears a resemblance to meme coin investors, it is not coincidental.Sealana is a chubby seal in the Solana Sea. Like most meme coin investors, he is ‘whaled at his PC and growing by the day’. He has traded the ‘gorgeous figure of his youth to find the next big Solana meme coin’. Who cares if he is in a big fat mess? He is just about to stumble on a fortune.The project gets the relatability factor right with the hilarious narrative.So far, investors have pumped more than $4 million into the ongoing presale. The presale is priced at $0.022 per unit. The cheap and fixed price gives early investors a low entry point into the investment. Analysts predict the price of $SEAL to take off on its debut exchange launch.The presale success reflects the voracious appetite for novel themes in the meme coin market.The resurrection of Pepe to a $5B market cap, the grand reception of Solana meme coins like Book of Meme (BOME) and Cat in a Dogs World (MEW), and the rising FOMO around Sealana indicate the massive market shift.With quirky posts, Sealana has become an instant crowd-puller on social media platforms. The Twitter following of the project has blown up to 10.9K. The Telegram account, on the other hand, has crossed 11K.The rapid community growth is rooted in the hilarious persona of Sealana that embraces the degen meme coin culture.Although the project lacks any substantial utility from a technical point of view, it has tapped into the viral meme coin craze early on. It is similar to the explosive growth of iconic meme coin projects like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Pepe.To add to that, Sealana comes with a Solana meme coin label. Solana is home to some of the most viral meme coins of 2024 like Dogwifhat, Bonk, and BOOK OF MEME. It is a hotspot for emerging meme coins.Although Sealana has adopted the Solana meme coin label, the $SEAL presale is available on the Solana and Ethereum networks to maximise accessibility. Virality doesn’t come at the cost of user experience, as a result.The Sealana presale supports purchases in SOL, ETH, USDT, USDC, and bank cards.The investment process is simple and straightforward. Moreover, it is inclusive. While most public presales are preceded by private sales, Sealana is made available to the public at discounted prices before the exchange listing. There is no minimum investment requirement either, ensuring a fair launch.For the latest updates about the project and the presale, follow Sealana on Telegram Sealana has won the attention of top crypto analysts and publications with its hot presale and social media activities.Right after the presale, $SEAL tokens will be listed on top crypto exchanges. While $SEAL is available for purchase at fixed discounted prices now, the market will determine its price based on supply and demand after the launch.The escalating FOMO hints at an explosive launch. According to popular YouTuber ClayBro who has over 130k subscribers, Sealana might be one of the best Solana meme coins to invest in now.But some analysts are more optimistic. For example, the Crypto News YouTube channel speculates 100x gains from the seal-themed meme coin.Sealana’s bullish predictions are backed by the massive success of previous Solana meme coins like Dogwifhat and BOME. With the market becoming more receptive toward non-dog coins like Pepe, Cat in a Dogs World, Gorilla, and GameStop to name a few, Sealana shows high promise.Solana has proven to be a fertile environment for meme coins over the last few months. Low fees, high speeds, and a frictionless user experience are its key advantages. It is particularly suitable for meme coin traders looking to take advantage of small price movements.The growth potential of the Solana ecosystem is best substantiated by SOL’s turbocharged rise to the fifth position in crypto rankings.Solana has jumped 811.11% in a year. Bitcoin pales in comparison, with a 147% jump.Solana has been consistently outperforming competitor networks with its fast-expanding ecosystem. Solana meme coins unlock the vast potential of the network. The rise of Dogwifhat and Bonk kindled a new wave of Solana meme coins this year.A large numberof hot new meme coins share a Solana label. Popcat, Ponke, Myro, Beercoin, Slerf, and Slothana are good examples of the trend. Slothana soared 5X after a FOMO-fuelled presale, rewarding early investors generously.If the presale momentum is any sign, Sealana is next in line for a meme coin pump.The $SEAL presale countdown has begun. Investors have just seven more days to grab $SEAL tokens for a fixed, discounted price of $0.022.To learn more about Sealana and to join the $SEAL presale, visit the official Sealana website.",Sealana ($SEAL) craze is mounting to new heights.

Under US rules, American firms are barred from servicing equipment at advanced Chinese factories.But the ASML servicing contracts are still in place, the person said, explaining that the Dutch government does not have the extraterratorial scope to cut them off.ASML said in April it expects to be able to service most of the billions of euros worth of equipment it has sold to China, though it cannot use spare parts from the US that would fall under US restrictions. It did not have immediate comment on Wednesday.The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Sanctioned Chinese telecoms giant Huawei last year came out with a phone powered by a sophisticated chip.

The FOMO surrounding PlayDoge ($PLAY) is growing to new heights.The project has raised over $4M in just two weeks. PlayDoge brings back the Tamagotchi craze to the world in a meme coin packaging.The excitement around the P2E game has been driving massive traffic to the $PLAY presale.Will PlayDoge live up to expectations? Here is a comprehensive analysis and price prediction of PlayDoge.PlayDoge is a meme coin. But it is much more than that. It is not ready to join the endless list of hollow meme coins that crowd the market. Most of these meme coins have a short shelf life, thanks to their lack of focus on quality and utility.PlayDoge has taken a different approach. It is launching a play-to-earn game themed around the 90s craze of Tamagotchi virtual pets.They are a cultural phenomenon. Over 82 million Tamagotchi units have been sold since 1996. In the hectic modern world, they represent the obsession with digital companionship. Interestingly, they also emerged back into the mainstream during the pandemic.The game will be built in true meme coin fashion. To be more precise, in the Doge style.Gamers will have virtual Doge pets in the game. The challenge is to feed, train, and take care of these pets. You also need to play with the virtual Doges to keep them happy and healthy in the 8-bit universe. That’s what the mini 2D adventures are for.Gamers who are invested in the happiness and health of their virtual pets will be rewarded generously in $PLAY tokens. Being a cryptocurrency, $PLAY can be swapped for other crypto or fiat currencies. As gamers step up their game and climb to the top of the leaderboards, they will be eligible for more rewards.Crypto analyst and YouTuber ClayBro introduces PlayDoge as one of the most promising mobile-based play-to-earn (P2E) games.PlayDoge is essentially a play-to-earn coin.Why did it adopt a meme coin persona, then?To draw more attention. That’s the most likely explanation. Besides, the Doge phenomenon of this decade aligns with the Tamagotchi craze of the ‘90s.The meme coin identity gives virality to PlayDoge. As a play-to-earn meme coin, the viral potential of the meme coin is even bigger. Within the meme coin niche, the project has opted for the sensational Doge label.To give a better perspective, four out of the top five meme coins are dog coins. The growing FOMO around the project and the escalating traffic to the ongoing $PLAY presale show that the strategy has worked.Like all iconic meme coins, PlayDoge shows high speculative potential. It is positioned for a wild bull run on its debut exchange launch if the unfolding buying frenzy is any sign.How long will it last, however?Meme coins are mostly short-term phenomena.PlayDoge’s long-term vision underpinned by its play-to-earn ecosystem makes it a rare exception. The game will continue to drive demand for the token, even after the initial meme coin wave subsides. The attention will shift to the utility aspect of the project over time.The game is set to launch on both Google Play Store and App Store once the development is completed. It has the potential to attract millions of users over the next few years.The nature of the game (taking care of a pet) promotes long-term participation. It is fun, silly, and challenging. Gamers don’t need a lot of gaming experience to collect points. But consistency is rewarded. As the number of active players on PlayDoge grows, so will the demand for $PLAY.In the ongoing presale, $PLAY is selling for $0.00507. The tentative listing price is $0.00540.Here is an overview of PlayDoge (PLAY) price prediction from 2024 to 2030.Popular crypto publications and analysts have been sharing positive reviews of PlayDoge. For example, crypto analysts like Oscar Ramos and Matthew Perry have an optimistic long-term outlook for PlayDoge.Staking has proven to be a time-tested strategy to discourage early-stage sell-offs. Staking rewards investors during the holding period. The longer they hold the token, the higher the staking rewards.$PLAY has also adopted a staking mechanism to mitigate pump-and-dump schemes. It strengthens the token’s appeal among the non-gamer population. Meme coin investors looking for the next big thing are hoarding the token, in addition to gamers.Staking will encourage them to hold on to their token long after the token’s initial price surge.Staking is live right from the presale stage. Compared to the industry standard that hovers under 10%, the platform offers a super compelling deal above 200%. But the staking APY will adjust over time to accommodate more users.Early investors grab the highest presale discounts and staking APYs.Half of the token supply is distributed to the community of early backers in the ongoing presale. The community-centric tokenomics is designed with a focus on the sustainable growth of the project.The PlayDoge presale is moving toward an early sell-out by the end of July. But it could be earlier, fuelled by meme coin hype and the attractive staking rewards.The residual FOMO from the presale will lay the foundation for a strong bull run on the token’s launch. Since the staking mechanism incentivises presale investors to hold onto their $PLAY tokens, a large community of long-term investors will take shape over the following months.The next rally is likely to begin in the fall, ignited by the PlayDoge P2E launch. More players will scramble to collect the tokens in this stage. From a conservative point of view, $PLAY could go 10X by the end of the year.",PlayDoge is launching a play-to-earn game themed around the 90s craze of Tamagotchi virtual pets. The FOMO surrounding PlayDoge ($PLAY) is growing to new heights. The project has raised over $4M in just two weeks.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111106519,imgsize-324631,width-838,resizemode-4/111106519.jpg"

The presale will end on June 25 at 6 PM UTC. Investors are rushing to hoard the Solana meme coin at the lowest possible price before it takes off on its debut exchange launch.Sealana needs no introduction. It is the hottest meme coin of this season, trending across social media platforms. The Sealana presale went live just a few weeks back.The growing craze around Sealana has to do with its theme. As the name makes it obvious, Sealana is not another doge clone looking for a shortcut into the meme coin market. The project ventures beyond existing meme coin frameworks and introduces a refreshing narrative into the market.The quirky theme’s South Park vibe is not accidental. That explains why the presale took off within hours of its release. The overweight seal is a proud American patriot who dreams of leaving his mom’s basement at some point.Like any meme coin investor, Sealana is looking for the next big thing in the crypto market , preferably built on the Solana blockchain.But Sealana is not ready to settle for the Solana ecosystem. It is planning a multichain infrastructure that ensures a seamless trading experience for a wide range of investors.As Sealana soars to the end of its presale, the social media frenzy is heating up. The project has a growing community of 10,400 followers on Twitter so far. The Telegram community, on the other hand, has 9200 members.But that’s not all.

The presale supports purchases in USDT, SOL, USDC, and ETH. The platform also supports card payments.Once the presale is over, the market will decide the price of $SEAL tokens. Judging by the presale FOMO and community support, the token has the potential to go on a wild bull run after its launch.There are more meme coins at the forefront of this month’s rally. For example, the buzz around Base Dawgz (DAWGZ) is growing to new heights. The viral meme coin is nestled in the Base blockchain ecosystem. With Base meme coins sparking a massive buying frenzy, the hype around Base Dawgz is well-founded.The meme coin is themed around an adorable Shiba Inu mascot sporting a base-jumping suit and goggles.Although DAWGZ doesn't have any real-world utility, it is technically stronger than most meme coins. The multichain infrastructure put forward by the project allows investors to effortlessly move tokens across networks like Ethereum, Solana, BNB Chain, and Avalanche.DAWGZ offers a staking protocol to encourage early and long-term investments. By joining the staking pool, investors can grow their tokens over time.Base Dawgz has also launched a ""Be Social for Airdrop"" campaign, as part of community building.

One will say the meme coin sector is the best performing one this bull cycle and they wouldn’t be wrong. We’ve witnessed crazy runs from PEPE, WIF, and BRETT, among others. Base Dawgz is the latest addition with over $1 million raised only a few days following the launch of their presale.This is a multi-chain meme coin that operates on the Base (logical, since it has ‘Base’ in its name too), but also on Ethereum, Solana, Binance Smart Chain and Avalanche networks.This article outlines the steps to purchase DAWGZ tokens prior to the end of the presale period.Even though the Base Dawgz presale has been live for just around a week, it already raised over $1 million which is the first big presale milestone for this project.The team haven’t announced soft or hard caps which means they can decide to end the presale and launch the token on exchanges at any given time.Current price of the DAWGZ token is 0.00502, but it will gradually increase as the project moves to the next stages. The presale accepts wallet-to-wallet payments via various cryptocurrencies, including ETH, USDT, BNB, SOL, and AVAX.This token is a meme-inspired crypto operating on multiple blockchains, including Base (as the main label), but also Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche, Solana, and BNB Chain, through the implementation of Wormhole and Portal Bridge technology.But, why is this functionality important? Well, the multi-chain compatibility allows users to seamlessly switch between networks without incurring additional fees, thereby expanding the token's reach and potential use cases.Users can earn points by sharing $DAWGZ-related content on social media, which can be redeemed for additional $DAWGZ tokens.The total supply of $DAWGZ tokens is 8,453,000,000. The token distribution plan includes 40% for presale investors and liquidity, 20% for staking and liquidity, 15% for marketing, 15% for $DAWGZ rewards, and 10% for listings. The smart contract has been audited by Solid Proof for security and integrity.This token distribution is pretty standard, but it’s definitely encouraging they dedicated 15% for rewards.In order to buy DAWGZ, you need to have a wallet supported by presale’s official website. Currently, you can buy it with MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, WalletConnect and Trust Wallet.Obviously, any of these work well, but we’ve used MetaMask as an example. MetaMask wallet works through browser’s extension or as an app on iOS and Android devices. In case you need help setting up this wallet, check out this guide. Moreover, you will need to have coins in your wallet to complete the purchase. Also, you should have a few tokens for gas fees, depending on which network you will be using.For Base and Ethereum networks you need ETH for the fees, and for Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche, and Solana’s chains you need BNB, AVAX and SOL respectively.You can buy DAWGZ either with the network's native currency or USDT on ETH, BUSD on BSC, and USDC on Base.Open the BaseDawgz’s official presale website and then click the “connect wallet” button.Choose the wallet you want to use for this transaction. As mentioned, we chose MetaMask as one of the most secure online crypto wallets.Once you approve connecting your wallet to Base Dawgz’s site, select the cryptocurrency you want to exchange for $DAWGZ and then enter the amount.In our example, we chose USDT on the ETH network and added 400 USDT which is equivalent to 79,891 DAWGZ (per the current presale price).Then you should click the “approve now” button and approve the transaction from your wallet. Within a few minutes, you should refresh the site and see that the transaction was successfully completed.The final step is obviously to claim your $DAWGZ tokens, but this will be available once the presale is finished. Make sure to follow their official social media accounts where they will announce the “claim” date.In early June, Base Dawgz launched a presale campaign for its native token, $DAWGZ, in early June. The project is built and operates on the Base network, primarily.Also, this is a project that aims to leverage the benefits of the Base network to operate on multiple blockchain networks.Interoperability features like Wormhole and Portal Bridge helps with this and it also aims to allow users to switch between networks without incurring additional fees.The project offers several innovative features designed to attract and engage users. Besides the multi-chain thing, there’s also the share-to-earn program, where users can earn points by sharing $DAWGZ-related content on social media. These points can be redeemed for additional $DAWGZ tokens.This feature allows the $DAWGZ token to operate on various ecosystems, including Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche, Solana, and BNB Chain.There are several goals with this utility. Firstly, Base Dawgz expands its potential user base.Secondly, users can effortlessly transfer their $DAWGZ tokens between supported networks, which eliminates the need for complex swaps or bridging processes, and minimizes associated fees.And finally, this can position Base Dawgz as a versatile and widely accessible meme coin.The team has high hopes about the share-to-earn feature. This innovative part of the Base Dawgz project has the goal to bring organic traction to the presale.So, users can earn valuable $DAWGZ tokens if they actively share content related to the project on various social media platforms (such as X for instance).Users can create and share memes, videos, or other creative works that promote Base Dawgz. And in return, they will accumulate points that can be redeemed for $DAWGZ tokens.Marketing is crucial for any early-stage crypto project, and Base Dawgz’s team is doing a great job in this area so far. They are advertising on multiple crypto media outlets and already made deals with some strong YouTubers such as ClayBro or 99Bitcoins who have hundreds of thousands of subscribers.If they keep it up, marketing could be one of the main reasons for the project’s success (except their innovative features of course).The project also launched a staking feature, but this is for now available only on Ethereum network. However, the team has plans to expand this mechanism on other networks too.It’s tricky to predict potential for gains when it comes to early-stage meme coins.However, with a well-designed tokenomics model, a strong community-centric approach, and a well-prepared marketing plan, Base Dawgz has the potential to take a share of the meme coin market and potentially turn into a more mainstream crypto with real-world use cases across multiple blockchain ecosystems.Meme coin enthusiasts are eagerly participating in the Base Dawgz presale, eyeing $DAWGZ tokens at the current attractive prices. The project's fundraising campaign has already garnered good traction, surpassing $1 million in presale investments within days.Finally, it's important to note that the presale price of $DAWGZ tokens will increase in just 5 days, making early participation crucial for securing the lowest cost entry point.","Base Dawgz ($DAWGZ) is a multi-chain meme coin that operates on the Base (logical, since it has ‘Base’ in its name too) and other networks.

Litigation and competition

Crypto and Covid

AI sales explode

The year was 1999. Steve Jobs had recently returned to lead Apple . Intel was the dominant force in semiconductors. And a little-known chipmaker named Nvidia made its debut on the Nasdaq stock exchange.It took less than three years for Nvidia Corp. to ascend into the S&P 500 — replacing the disgraced oil-trading conglomerate Enron, no less.But even then, few people would have bet that the company would go on to become the best performing stock of the last quarter-century, posting a total return of 591,078% since its initial public offering, including reinvested dividends. It’s a difficult number to comprehend and a testament, in part, to the financial mania brewing around artificial intelligence and how investors have come to see Nvidia — which makes the cutting-edge chips powering the technology — as the single-biggest winner of the boom.On Tuesday, that run culminated in Nvidia unseating Microsoft Corp. as the world’s most valuable company with a market capitalization of $3.34 trillion. More than $2 trillion of that value has been added this year.The company’s rise was by no means assured — and neither is its staying power at the top of the S&P 500. Long-time investors in Nvidia have had to stomach three annual collapses of 50% or more in the stock. Sustaining the current rally will require customers to keep spending billions of dollars a quarter on AI equipment, whose returns on investment are so far relatively small.What ultimately paved the way for Nvidia to climb to the top, though, was the company’s big bet on graphics chips and the vision of co-founder and Chief Executive OfficerJensen Huang that the industry would shift to what he calls “accelerated computing,” something his chips are inherently better at than the competition.“You have to give the management team, I think, an enormous amount of credit,” said Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management. “They have caught each wave of innovation in hardware perfectly well.”Here’s a look at Nvidia from its IPO to now.Nvidia got off to a hot start.Between its debut and the time it entered the S&P 500, the stock gained more than 1,600%, giving it a market value of about $8 billion. That rise came as many other technology stocks were cratering in the aftermath of the dot-com bubble, which peaked in March 2000.The company’s key to early success: getting its technology in video-game consoles like Microsoft’s Xbox and Sony’s PlayStation. Nvidia’s GeForce graphics processing units, or GPUs, became objects of desire among gamers because they consistently offered the most realistic experience.“Jensen was always a great communicator, told a good story, and clearly GPUs were becoming more important,” said Rhys Williams, chief strategist at Wayve Capital Management, who was a buyer in the IPO. “Each successive generation of hardware gave a lot better performance, a lot more realistic picture and then PC gaming really came into being.”The next six years weren’t kind to Nvidia. The stock plunged in 2008 as the financial crisis weakened demand and long-struggling rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. started turning things around.Meanwhile, an agreement between Nvidia and Intel that allowed the companies to use each other’s capabilities went sour, forcing Nvidia out of one of its biggest markets. The two settled in 2011, with Intel agreeing to pay Nvidia $1.5 billion.The following year, Nvidia unveiled graphics chips for servers inside data centers. They could help sophisticated computing work such as oil and gas exploration and weather prediction, giving Nvidia a foothold in what would become a lucrative market. However, those chips did not immediately fly off the shelf. It would take nearly nine years for Nvidia shares to surpass their 2007 high.Nvidia shares took off again in 2015. During that period, the company’s chips were becoming the foundation of emerging technologies, from advanced graphics interfaces to autonomous vehicles to a new wave of AI products.That’s when Shana Sissel, chief executive officer at Banrion Capital Management, first really took note of the company. She described a 2017 conference where Nvidia was more like a pageant winner than an investment idea.“Every single speaker talked about Nvidia being the most important company,” Sissel said. “At that point, it was really on my radar screen.”Even after demand from cryptocurrency miners dried up, data-center sales continued to grow. The Covid-19 pandemic boosted that business, as companies needed to purchase additional computing power to support remote work. Nvidia’s data-center revenue rose by a multiple of eight from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2021.Nvidia’s shares slumped in 2022 along with the rest of the technology sector, which was reeling from soaring interest rates and falling demand after the Covid-era boom.OpenAI’s release of ChatGPT in late-2022 made an instant splash but it took time for investors to realize how Nvidia might benefit. Eventually, interest in ChatGPT and other generative AI products exploded, triggering a frantic surge in orders for Nvidia’s chips.When the company reported first-quarter 2023 earnings, the scale of the jump in its business shocked nearly everyone on Wall Street. Nvidia gave a forecast for quarterly sales that was more than 50% above the average projection.Nvidia’s data-center sales eclipsed its gaming revenue for the first time in fiscal 2023. In Nvidia’s current fiscal year, analysts expect those sales to top $100 billion.“They have a very defensible place in the industry,” said Williams, the strategist at Wayve Capital Management. “They’re not gonna be 95% of market share forever, obviously, but it would be almost impossible for anybody to replace them.”","N Nvidia has posted a total return of 591,078% since its IPO in 1999. The company is now the world’s most valuable company with a market capitalization of $3.34 trillion. Its rise was by no means assured, and neither is its staying power at the top of the S&P.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111100413,imgsize-45534,width-400,resizemode-4/111100413.jpg"
