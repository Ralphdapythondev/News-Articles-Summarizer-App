Good news for freshers! Indian IT sector entry-level hiring set to double in FY25,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/good-news-for-freshers-indian-it-sector-entry-level-hiring-set-to-double-in-fy25/articleshow/113842030.cms,"<p>The Indian IT industry experienced a turning point in the June quarter, with several companies reporting net headcount additions. (AI image) <br></p>

IT Sector Hiring Outlook

Indian IT sector to see hiring revival: The IT services sector is poised for a significant resurgence in fresher hiring this year, with estimates suggesting a nearly twofold increase in entry-level recruitment compared to the previous fiscal year. Data obtained by ET indicates that the sector is expected to exceed 150,000 fresher hires in FY25.Experts attribute this positive outlook to the growing demand in business, especially in the banking, financial services, and insurance (BFSI) segment, which represents the largest vertical for most IT companies.Additionally, substantial large deal wins and global expansion by major IT players contribute to this optimism.The Indian IT industry experienced a turning point in the June quarter, with several companies reporting net headcount additions after a period of decline.This increase in fresher hiring comes after a subdued FY24, during which clients reduced their technology spending. IT companies have also been expanding their operations beyond their primary geographies to mitigate risks. Recent months have shown signs of recovery in core regions, especially with interest rate cuts by central banks in Europe and the US.""FY2024 saw the lowest intake of freshers in the IT sector since 2000. However, FY2025 is expected to witness a significant rebound, with a potential 100% year-on-year (YoY) growth, surpassing 150,000 entry-level hires,"" said Kapil Joshi, Deputy CEO at Quess IT Staffing. This contrasts with the roughly 60,000 net hires reported by the $250 billion technology services industry in FY24.Aditya Narayan Mishra, MD & CEO of staffing firm CIEL HR, notes, ""Fresher hiring demand is projected to rise by 10-15% in the second half of FY25 compared to the same period last year. This growth is primarily driven by a reduction in bench strength and an optimistic industry outlook for the coming months."" CIEL HR estimates suggest that Indian IT services firms have already hired around 150,000-170,000 freshers in the calendar year 2024.Mishra further commented, ""This reflects a cautious yet strategic hiring approach amid economic uncertainties. Compared to the same period last year, there has been an estimated 10% increase in fresher hiring, signaling a gradual recovery in the sector. Organisations are taking a balanced recruitment approach, aligning fresher intake with project demands while maintaining a prudent outlook on overall growth.""Also Read | Infosys ‘Power’ programme offering freshers Rs 9 lakh salary; substantially higher than Rs 3-3.5 lakh entry-level fresher pay Accenture , the global IT leader, reported a significant increase in headcount during the June-August quarter, with 24,000 new hires, the highest in the past ten quarters. The company's Chair and CEO, Julie Sweet, emphasized that the majority of the hiring is taking place in India, particularly in the technology sector, and includes onboarding new college graduates to refresh their talent pyramid.A report by Nuvama suggests that most companies expanded their workforce in Q1 FY25 and are now focusing on optimizing their talent pyramid. They are preparing to onboard freshers hired in the previous quarters, and this deployment is expected to contribute to future growth. Notably, Infosys has sent onboarding emails to more than 1,000 engineering graduates who had been waiting for placement for over two years.In Q1, Infosys and Wipro announced plans to resume campus hiring this fiscal year after a one-year hiatus. TCS , the industry leader, has committed to hiring 40,000 freshers in FY25, while the top four IT players, including HCLTech , have collectively pledged to hire around 82,000 freshers.Recent reports indicate that these four IT companies signed at least 33 deals in July and August, necessitating the need for talent to execute the projects.","The Indian IT industry experienced a turning point in the June quarter, with several companies reporting net headcount additions.

"Employees take note! Should you be worried about new TDS deposit rules for employers effective from October 1, 2024?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/employees-take-note-should-you-be-worried-about-new-tds-deposit-rules-for-employers-effective-from-october-1-2024/articleshow/113847170.cms,"Employees may be concerned that the relaxation in TDS compliance granted to companies. (AI image)

What are the new TDS Deposit Rules?

New TDS Deposit Rules Explained with Example

Should employees be worried?

New TDS Deposit Rules : The government has eased the regulations surrounding the time frame within which companies or deductors must deposit TDS (deducted from payments made by them) with the government before a prosecution notice is issued. The standard due date for depositing TDS with the government is the 7th of the month following the month in which it is deducted.Employees may be concerned that the relaxation in TDS compliance granted to companies could affect the timely deposit of the tax against their respective PANs.According to an ET report, there have been recent instances of companies, such as SpiceJet and Byju's, not depositing TDS with the government on time, resulting in employees encountering income tax issues.Previously, companies had 60 days from the original due date to deposit the outstanding TDS (tax deducted at source). However, starting from October 1, 2024, the new income tax laws provide companies with additional time to accomplish this.From October 1 onwards, companies will have until the deadline to file the TDS return to deposit TDS with the government. Nevertheless, if the TDS is deposited after the original due date, penal interest would have to be paid in addition.Also Read | New TDS rates from October 1, 2024: What are the revised tax deducted at source rates? Check list of changes for these transactions This effectively grants an extra 20 days to make the TDS deposit, i.e., 60 days from the original due date plus an additional 20 days.The income tax department has introduced a new rule regarding the prosecution notice for companies that fail to deposit the TDS by the due date for filing the TDS return.Previously, the notice would be sent after 60 days from the due date for depositing the TDS. However, under the new TDS laws, the notice will be sent immediately if the company fails to deposit the TDS, along with the penal interest, by the TDS return filing deadline. This change applies only if the TDS amount exceeds Rs 25 lakh.To illustrate this change, consider a scenario where a company deducts tax from an employee's April salary. The last date to deposit the tax deducted in April is May 7, and the last date to file the TDS return for the tax deducted in April, May, and June is July 31. Under the earlier laws, if the company failed to deposit the tax deducted by July 7 (60 days from the due date of May 7), the income tax department would send a notice asking why the company should not be prosecuted.With the new TDS laws, the income tax department will send the prosecution notice if the company fails to deposit the TDS, along with the penal interest, by July 31, the TDS return filing deadline.According to the income tax laws, the tax deductor must deposit the TDS dues on or before the seventh of the subsequent month, with an exception in April. For government employees, the March TDS is deposited on or before April 7, while for others, it is April 30.Also Read | Latest post office small savings schemes interest rates Oct-Dec 2024: Government announces rates for PPF, SSY, SCSS, NSC - check list The recent amendments to the TDS laws provide companies with additional time to deposit the TDS with the government. However, concerns have been raised about the potential negative impact on employees.Many employees do not regularly review their Form 26AS and Annual Information Statement ( AIS ) during the financial year to verify if their employer has deposited the tax deducted from their salary against their PAN.Typically, employees check their Form 26AS and AIS in the following year while filing their income tax returns. When employers fail to deposit the TDS, employees are often surprised when they review their Form 26AS and AIS.Media reports have highlighted instances where employees of Byju's received tax notices from the income tax department regarding unpaid TDS dues. Recently, SpiceJet acknowledged that TDS dues remained unpaid between April 2020 and August 2023.Pranay Bhatia, Partner & Leader, Corporate Tax, Tax & Regulatory Services, BDO India, was quoted as saying by ET, ""The new TDS laws provide extra time for companies to deposit TDS dues with the government. While this relaxation will help companies, it will not adversely affect the employees' TDS credit. The income tax department can still send the prosecution notice to the companies if they fail to deposit the tax deducted on or before the due date to file TDS return statement.""Naveen Wadhwa, Vice President of Research and Advisory Division, Taxmann, adds, ""The relaxation of TDS laws from October 1, 2024, offers companies extra time to deposit TDS along with the penal interest before the prosecution notice is sent. However, the new TDS laws will not adversely impact employees' TDS credit against their PAN.""Recent reports have highlighted instances where employers have withheld TDS from their employees' salaries but failed to remit the funds to the government. As a result, numerous employees faced difficulties in claiming TDS credit when submitting their income tax returns.According to Wadhwa, ""Section 205 of the Income-tax Act prohibits tax recovery from taxpayers, provided tax is deducted from their salary or any other income but not deposited with the tax department. However, taxpayers must provide proof to the income tax department that tax has been deducted from their salary.""By furnishing evidence of TDS deductions, individuals can ensure they receive the appropriate TDS credit and prevent any additional tax liabilities.","The government has eased the regulations surrounding the time frame within which companies or deductors must deposit TDS (deducted from payments made by them) The standard due date for depositing TDS with the government is the 7th of the month following the month in which it is deducted. From October 1 onwards, companies will have until the deadline to file the TDS return to deposit T DS.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113848173,imgsize-50376,width-400,resizemode-4/113848173.jpg"
"Stock market today: BSE Sensex recovers losses, moves up 300 points; Nifty50 near 25,300",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/stock-market-today-bse-sensex-nifty50-october-04-2024-dalal-street-indian-equities-global-markets-middle-east-tensions/articleshow/113924633.cms,"Stock market's recent decline is primarily because of heightened tensions in the Middle East and a sharp increase in crude oil prices. (AI image)

Stock market today : Indian equity benchmark indices, BSE Sensex and Nifty50, recovered after initial losses in mid-day trade. While BSE Sensex moved up to above 82,800 level, Nifty50 was near 25,300. At 11:42 AM, BSE Sensex was trading at 82,812.81, up 316 points or 0.38%. Nifty50 was at 25,328.50, up 78 points or 0.31%.The Indian stock market indices, Sensex and Nifty, managed to recover from their initial losses on Friday, primarily due to the strong performance of IT and banking stocks.However, they are still on track to experience their worst weekly performance in over two years, mainly because of significant foreign outflows and growing worries about the intensifying conflict in the Middle East.Despite the recovery, both the Nifty and Sensex are still down 3.3% for the week, which is their worst performance since June 2022, largely due to a 2% slump on Thursday, according to an ET report.Investors are likely to remain cautious due to concerns about the escalating conflict in the Middle East and the ongoing foreign outflows from domestic equities. The conflict intensified earlier this week when Iran fired ballistic missiles at Israel, raising concerns that crude supplies from the world's top oil-producing region could be disrupted if the situation worsens. As a result, oil prices rose while global stocks declined slightly.In the Sensex pack, the top contributors to the index's upward movement were Infosys, HDFC Bank, Axis Bank, TCS, SBI, and Tata Motors, while M&M, Bajaj Finance, Asian Paints, Nestle, and Bharti Airtel traded in the red. On the sectoral front, Nifty IT and Nifty PSU Bank both gained 1.6%, while Nifty Bank, Financial Services, Metal, Pharma, Consumer Durables, and Oil & Gas also traded higher.DMart shares fell 4.4% in early trade after brokerages provided mixed outlooks on the supermarket chain's Q2FY25 business update. Experts believe that the sharp correction in the Nifty on the previous day was primarily due to massive FII selling rather than fears of escalating tensions in the Middle East.FIIs have sold equities worth Rs 30,614 crores in the cash market over the last three days, moving money from expensive India to cheap Hong Kong in anticipation of monetary and fiscal stimulus implemented by Chinese authorities to stimulate the Chinese economy and improve the earnings of Chinese companies.The market direction in the near term will be influenced by the tug-of-war between FIIs and DIIs, with DIIs having deeper pockets and greater conviction to buy into the India Growth Story. The short-term trend for the Nifty has turned bearish, with the next support level seen near 25,070, where the 50-day EMA is placed. Resistance for the index has shifted down to the 25,400-25,500 band.Asian stocks retreated on Friday, while oil prices headed for their sharpest weekly gain in more than a year due to escalating tensions in the Middle East. The foreign institutional investors (FIIs) sold equities worth Rs 15,243 crore on October 3, while domestic institutional investors bought equities worth Rs 12,914 crore on the same day. The Indian rupee turned flat at 83.96 against the US dollar in early trade, and the dollar index declined 0.03% to 101.9 level.","BSE Sensex and Nifty50 recovered after initial losses in mid-day trade.

'Need attractive regime for China+1 to succeed',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/need-attractive-regime-for-china1-to-succeed/articleshow/113996335.cms,"How do you see the developments in India over the last three-four years? Is there a sense of complacency on the economy?

Is there a need to work on stepping up the growth rate and what needs to be done given that jobs are a major concern?

Is it possible to create same number of jobs like earlier, given higher mechanisation and digitisation?

There are fears that excess capacity in China (due to the slowdown) may affect other markets because of subsidies being given...

Do you see a shift due to the

China Plus One

strategy, including to India?

India has put checks on investment from countries with which it shares land borders, a move aimed at China, citing security reasons. There have been suggestions that easing investments can help reduce the trade deficit. How do you see it?

Asian Development Bank (ADB) chief economist Albert Park was in the Capital for the Kautilya Economic Conclave. In an interview, he told TOI that the agency is keeping close tabs on global crude prices to assess the impact of the escalating conflict in West Asia on the region and advocated that trade and investment channels should be kept open. Excerpts:Govt is focused on growth and they are trying to understand the costs and benefits of various economic policies in a pragmatic way.The pragmatism is leading to good outcomes as we see significant govt investment in infrastructure, efforts to reduce regulatory burden on firms and improved ease of doing business. The goal is to promote economic activity, raise productivity, promote more investments, and create more jobs.Our projection is of India growing at 7% this year and 7.2% next year. It is the highest growth for any economy in Asia. It may be possible to grow faster but the main thing is not to focus on any number, just continue to think about how the basic environment for business can improve. All the fundamentals are good, India is enjoying demographic dividend and there is a lot of positive sentiment among consumers and investors.Employment is an important issue. The good thing is poverty and inequality have reduced. If you try to create more jobs for less skilled sectors, then you will need to support more labour-intensive manufacturing and sectors where you have comparative advantage. The success of Tamil Nadu and Gujarat is the right way, and we should think how more states can do it.There may be some truth to that, but I am not sure if it affects our strategy, labour-intensive sectors still create a lot of jobs. Even as employment opportunities in manufacturing have a lower ceiling than in the past, opportunities in the services sector have increased because digitization is making services trade much more feasible. India has benefited from that... the only concern is that they tend to be more skill intensive. India should be pushing on all fronts. There are a lot of synergies between manufacturing and services.There is no rule about how much you should be producing in a global economy. If you think it reflects unfair trade practices, we have the WTO principles to guide us on what justifies countervailing or anti-dumping duty. Countries, rather than politicise trade, should stick to these principles and do due diligence and impose what is appropriate.We have seen shifts in FDI and trade flows. Countries that benefit the most are also the ones that are very competitive producers. Countries with a good investment environment have benefited, Vietnam, India, to some extent, Mexico due to proximity to the US. India and Indonesia also benefit from being big markets. It's an opportunity, especially, if it gives a foothold into new sectors, semiconductor chains, anything related to green transition. For India to maximise the gains, it needs to provide a very attractive investment environment, which can be improved over time. Just giving subsidies is not going to be sustainable.Security is a non-economic factor and govts must decide their priorities. From an economic standpoint, you should minimise restrictions. I wish the US and EU also took the view that if the trade balance is not good, allow Chinese firms to invest and produce. It creates more local employment and technology transfer.","Asian Development Bank chief economist Albert Park was in the Capital for the Kautilya Economic Conclave.

Railway Budget 2024 : The government has wavered little in its efforts to spur a modernisation of railways in the country, pivoting on technology, to support the country’s economic ambitions. In line with expectations, Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore, marking yet another year of successive increase in outlay.That takes forward the past policies and the government’s vision, which have paved the way for modernisation of the transport behemoth.In earlier decades, the government had focused on laying tracks on new routes, electrification and incremental rolling stock capacity addition. That was the need of the hour back then and has helped set up the base for a larger transformation.For instance, the massive Dedicated Freight Corridor ( DFC ) as well as locomotive factories at Marhaura and Madhepura in Bihar were conceptualised over a decade ago and we are seeing their completion now.More recently, the focus has shifted to modernisation—of rolling stock and safety systems, among other aspects.This year, emphasis has also been laid on the railways’ crucial role in industrial development. Commodity-specific corridors have been planned in eastern India and impetus given to port connectivity. Vande Bharat and technology-led upgrades in rolling stock remain in focus. Safety has been prioritised through budgetary allocations for the anti-collision systemKavach . That said, there are other cogs in the wheel that demand attention from a long-term perspective.First, the target for the Operating Ratio, the crucial efficiency gauge, has been set at 98.22% for 2024-25, compared with 98.65% in 2023-24. This reflects an imminent need for operational transformation. An effective overhaul of the world’s fourth-largest rail network will take many years and thus we need to start focusing on improving efficiency and reducing costs now.DFC is almost entirely operational and will be complete over the next few months. To ensure the project achieves its twin goals of reducing logistics costs and enhancing freight efficiency, railways need to attract more cargo on the corridor. This will help increase the rail coefficient and make the railways’ approach more market-oriented, which will in turn aid future corridors.A revamp of railway stations is on track, with sufficient funds dedicated to this end. But even though new coaches and wagons are increasingly being added to meet footfalls, the stations and passenger trains themselves remain synonymous with chaos.Just as safety, comfort and convenience have been prioritised, there is a need for solutions to address the capacity and demand challenges. As a first step, the government could target development of new stations and setting up of new coach production units.As a leading freight mover, Indian Railways carried a record 1,588 MT cargo in fiscal 2024, up from 1,095 MT in fiscal 2015. It accounts for 26% of the cargo moved in the country—by no means an easy feat. The railways aims to take this volume to 3,000 MT by 2030, which would require a 11% CAGR against the around 4.2% witnessed over the last 10 years. As per a report by TERI and Shakti Foundation, from carrying about 62% of freight traffic in 1990-91, Indian Railways’ share has declined to ~27% in 2014-15. This has been due to the expanding road network, cost competitiveness over railways, and door-to-door service. Thus, commencing the cycle of increasing the rail share again is commendable.DFCs, a high-capacity track network, high-power locomotives and improvement in wagon designs have set the ball rolling for larger capacity, faster freight trains that deliver better efficiency.Yet, achieving exponential growth is a tall ask given the current dynamics. Possibly, similar challenges might apply to other goals the railways might have for 2047.To be fair, despite its scale and complexity, Indian Railways has been able to achieve diverse developments at commendable speed.But the track ahead is long and it is time to start discussing the reinvention of the institutional set-up.Indian Railways sees substantial private sector involvement in the form of vendors and contractors. Policymakers could start mulling extreme options such as parallel privately-owned and operated railway infrastructure, coupled with centralised planning and an evolved role for the railways. This will need a robust policy framework from the Government of India.The time is perhaps also ripe to bring user charge and asset monetisation-driven segments for passengers as well as cargo to the discussion table. Globally, the separation of infrastructure and operations in railways has delivered mixed results, for example in the United Kingdom. The model should be analysed and revisited to understand its potential relevance in the Indian context.The key would be to retrace our steps and align our long-term goals to identify not just incremental changes but also ways to explore bold and path-breaking alternatives that put Indian Railways on a smooth track and bring it up to speed.","Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore.

Budget 2024 capital gains tax changes: The Narendra Modi government is considering suggestions for tweaks in the new long term capital gains tax regime that was announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman in Union Budget 2024.The July 23 budget reduced the LTCG tax on property from 20% to 12.5%. The indexation benefit, which allowed taxpayers to adjust the acquisition cost for inflation before calculating capital gains and thus reduce their tax liability, is proposed to be eliminated for properties purchased on or after April 1, 2001.The government publishes the Cost Inflation Index (CII) annually for this calculation.India Inc is appealing to the government for a gradual shift to the long-term capital gains tax regime proposed in the FY25 budget, which aims to eliminate indexation benefits for property, gold, and other unlisted assets.According to an ET report by Deepshikha Sikarwar, the industry is suggesting alternatives such as a higher tax rate with indexation or a lower rate of 12.5% without indexation, as well as some form of grandfathering for ancestral properties.The finance ministry is currently reviewing these proposals and will discuss them with the Prime Minister's Office. The final decision will be made closer to the date when the Finance Bill reply is to be presented in Parliament, the reports said.Industry groups are expected to submit formal proposals to the finance ministry in the near future.

Budget 2024 for manufacturing sector : The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth. While the middle class has been offered tax relief, the government's primary focus remains on judicious spending to maximize economic impact. The budget's core themes are employment, skilling, MSME development, and support for the middle class.Largely focus has remained intact on spending money judiciously to ensure that each penny spent creates a ripple effect in the entire economic landscape.Although at first glance, manufacturing might appear to have taken a backseat, a deeper analysis reveals a multifaceted approach to bolstering the sector. Initiatives like employment-linked benefits and internship programs, while primarily aimed at job creation and skill development, indirectly benefit manufacturing companies by expanding the talent pool.Extensive focus on the MSME manufacturing units by way of extending term loan facility for purchase of machinery and equipment without collateral or third-party guarantee, would help companies in augmenting their capital base/ capacity and strengthen the very foundation of the manufacturing ecosystem in the country. Development of a new credit-assessment model by Public Sector Banks to assess MSME credit shall provide much needed regulatory relief to the units.With respect to the large manufacturing entities, while there is no direct fiscal/ tax incentive introduced in this budget, some support has been provided with an extensive focus on development of ‘industrial parks’ in nearly 100 cities under the ‘plug and play’ model. Reforms proposed with respect to land administration, planning and management, shall also ease out acquisition related difficulties often faced by entrepreneurs/ business houses in acquiring lands for manufacturing set-ups.Targeted Customs duty interventions like, rationalization of Customs duty provisions in Mobile phone manufacturing setups, extension of Customs duty exemption on import of capital goods for manufacturing of solar cells and panels, full Customs duty exemption on import of 25 critical minerals,, shall provide the required impetus for enhancing domestic manufacturing environment.Governments’ focus on formulating an Economic Policy Framework to set the scope for next-gen reforms in the country, has a target to improve the productivity of factors of production, namely, land, labour, capital, entrepreneurship and technology. This shall pave the way for enabling achievement of a target of 25% manufacturing sector contribution to the nation’s GDP over the course of next 7-10 years.While the overall outlook is positive, the extension of tax benefits under Section 115BAB for manufacturing entities and the absence of new PLI schemes are notable omissions.The country’s manufacturing base is expanding as is reflective from the continuously increasing tax collections and expanding Purchasing Manager’s Index. It would be pertinent to see how the ground realities evolve vis-à-vis the vision envisaged, in the upcoming Financial Year.","The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth.

Budget 2024: Armed with the vision to propel India to become a developed country by 2047, the Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business thereby providing the required stimulus to the manufacturing sector and enabling large scale job creation.On the Indirect tax front, the industry welcomes the much-needed announcement for a comprehensive review of the rate structure under Customs enabling ease in product classification and dispute reduction.The proposal of lowering of Customs duty on a plethora of raw materials and products including solar cells, critical minerals and bullion are encouraging measures. The rationale behind such reduction clearly indicates support towards domestic manufacturing, deepening value addition and supporting targets in reducing carbon footprint.Relevant amendments under the Customs law have been made to provide increased time limits for re-imports and re-exports to enhance competitiveness of the fledgling MRO sector. The government has extended significant duty reduction and exemption benefits to the healthcare and electronics sectors, continuing the impetus of incentives provided under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme.Since their introduction in March 2020, the PLI schemes have indeed supported in revitalizing the manufacturing sector and strengthening the necessary supply chains. The success achieved in the mobile manufacturing sector has now enabled the Government to reduce customs duties on mobile phones and components, signalling a mature environment. The Budget proposals aim at reproducing similar outcomes for semiconductor and pharmaceutical industry by increasing the budgetary allocation.Buoyed by the increasing revenue collection under GST signalling a shift towards a mature tax regime, this Budget has harmonized the timeframes for the issuance of demand notices and adjudication orders for cases involving fraud, suppression or otherwise. Significant amendments to the GST legislations have been introduced reflecting the recommendations proposed by the GST Council such as regularizing non-levy of GST due to general practice which may turn out to be a breather for certain impacted industries reeling under huge tax demands.The Insurance sector has been provided much relief through the GST council recommendations which have been cemented in the present budget thereby ending long standing disputes on their business practices.The Government's efforts to push forward with its reform agenda are evident as plans to incentivize states for their business reform actions plans and digitalization through the Jan Vishwas Bill 2.0 is proposed. Further, setting up of e-commerce export hubs is envisaged to facilitate easier access to international markets for domestic players.The recent implementation of Budget proposals allows the government to maintain momentum in its reform agenda. These policy measures implicitly reaffirm the significance of India Inc as a crucial element in the development of infrastructure. However, there are still some expectations required to be met to march towards a Viksit Bharat 2047.",The Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business.

Budget 2024 : Real estate, a significant contributor to employment generation, has received a fair bit of attention in Budget 2024-25. Recent years have seen the sector transform rapidly, driven by factors such as favourable government policies, Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, strong economic growth and changing consumer preferences.Added to that, the budgetary focus on job creation, skilling and employment-linked incentives, infrastructure, urban development, rural connectivity, digitalisation and land-related norms, all dovetail to promote growth of the sector.Launched in June 2015, the PMAY aims to provide affordable housing to all eligible beneficiaries. The budget unveiled PMAY Urban 2.0, under which the housing needs of 1 crore urban poor and middle class will be addressed with an investment of Rs 10 lakh crore.The central government’s additional Rs 2.2 lakh crore injection in the next 5 years to make housing more affordable has the potential to revitalise the affordable housing market.Such an approach can play an important role in realising the government's vision of Housing for All and push growth and development. Hence, the significant investment under PMAY Urban 2.0 is expected to alleviate urban housing deficits, spurring construction and economic growth.Steps to introduce technological reforms within the regulatory framework for land, such as digitalisation or GIS mapping of land records, will improve transparency.Rationalisation of stamp duty across states will also be critical to bring in uniformity and initiate land-related reforms such as urban planning, usage and building bylaws.These are steps in the right direction and will boost growth. Moreover, they will improve the ease of property transactions and strengthen municipal finances through increased property taxes. Rationalization of stamp duty with an emphasis on women homebuyers may boost home-buyer sentiment in major cities, too.The budget has also given ample attention to urban and rural development, with rental housing for industrial workers through the public private partnership model, interest subsidies for rental housing, and transit-oriented developments.The proposal to develop investment-ready plug-and-play industrial parks in 100 cities may attract industrial investment, leading to increased demand for industrial real estate and support the growth of ancillary services and residential developments in these regions.Initiatives for industrial parks and rental housing for industrial workers align with the country’s manufacturing goals and addresses worker accommodation needs.These steps are expected to promote industrial growth and stability in labour-intensive sectors, while also creating new opportunities for real estate developers specialising in rental and affordable housing.The changes in long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax, however, have evoked a mixed reaction. The government lowered the long-term capital gains tax from 20% to 12.5%, which is a welcome step. However, this came with the removal of the indexation benefit.The changes could encourage more liquidity in property transactions and potentially increase the effective tax burden depending on the property’s acquisition date.The launch of Phase IV of the PM Gram Sadak Yojana in 25,000 rural habitations will improve connectivity in rural areas, promoting rural development and making these regions more accessible for investment.

This initiative focuses on enhancing connectivity and supporting economic development in rural areas.In essence, the budget is geared towards stimulating growth and investment in the real estate sector , fostering a more transparent and investor-friendly environment, and contributing to overall development. It aims to create a balanced and inclusive growth environment by addressing the needs of various segments, including affordable housing, industrial workers and urban infrastructure.The effectiveness of the initiatives, however, hinges on their implementation and continued support of complementary reforms.","The budget unveiled PMAY Urban 2.0, under which the housing needs of 1 crore urban poor and middle class will be addressed with an investment of Rs 10 lakh crore.

New Budget 2024 rule: Why Income Tax Department is likely to issue a huge number of tax notices this month,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-budget-2024-rule-why-income-tax-department-is-likely-to-issue-a-huge-number-of-tax-notices-this-month/articleshow/112186079.cms,"Taxing Times

Income Tax Notice on the way? The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month, as there are concerns that many taxpayers might escape the tax net due to the impending implementation of the new reassessment law on September 1, 2024.According to the amended regulation announced in Budget 2024 , the tax authorities can only go back a maximum of five years to reassess a taxpayer's records if the escaped income is at least Rs 50 lakh, and three years for an amount less than Rs 50 lakh.Previously, they could reassess cases up to 10 years old.According to an ET report, tax officials are now faced with the challenge of compiling and corroborating data on tax and income mismatches for the financial years 2013-14 to 2017-18 within the next few weeks, as these years will become time-barred for reassessment from September 1, 2024.The I-T department relies on information from various sources, such as banks, property registrars, and search findings from the investigation wing, to build reassessment cases.A tax officers' body has raised concerns about the feasibility of issuing notices under Section 148 (or 148A) in a large number of cases within a single month, given the overburdened nature of the jurisdictional assessing officers and the time-consuming process of obtaining sanction from the chief commissioner, who is the specified authority for such notices.Moreover, the law provides taxpayers with the right to explain their position before reassessment orders are finalized, a process that most believe cannot be completed by the end of August.Also Read | ITR refund status for FY 2023-24: How to check income tax refund status online - here’s a step-by-step guide for incometax.gov.in & NSDL websites The Central Board of Direct Taxes ( CBDT ) has been urged by its officers to postpone the effective date of the proposed amendment. However, this suggestion is unlikely to be well-received by corporations and high net worth individuals.""Capping the reassessment period at five years was a great decision as it would reduce hassles and litigation. But if the department fears there could be a genuine loss of revenue as it may not be possible to wrap up several matters by August 31, the government can think of strict parameters where time-bound cases can be selectively reopened - based on trails of steps taken in identifying escaped income,"" said Mitil Chokshi, partner at CA firm Chokshi & Chokshi.""Taxpayers may expect a rush of reassessment notices in August 2024. These notices are likely to be for the AYs 2018-19 and prior to that. It is pertinent to note that the Bombay High Court in a recent ruling in a case of Hexaware Technologies has taken a view on a proviso introduced in 2021, which can be interpreted to mean that AY 2017-18 (and prior years) got time barred on March 31, 2024. These reassessment notices (for AYs 2017-18 and prior) are likely to rake up new interpretation issues in the already muddled reassessment provisions,"" said Ashish Mehta, partner at law firm Khaitan & Co.The current situation is similar to the conflict between the Income Tax office and taxpayers in 2021. The reassessment law was amended in April 2021, allowing the tax office to reopen 10-year-old tax returns if the total undisclosed income exceeded Rs 50 lakh and reassess 4-year-old matters if the amount was less than Rs 50 lakh.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? However, this change led to over 10,000 writ petitions being filed by companies, arguing that they were not given sufficient time to explain and that the notices were issued without considering the carve-out that cases which couldn't be reopened earlier couldn't be reassessed under the new law.The Supreme Court invoked its extraordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution on May 4, 2022, to uphold all reassessment notices issued after March 31, 2021. However, the court left room for judicial proceedings based on the merits of each case, and several such matters are currently pending before the court.","The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month.

How NPS will increase tax savings

NPS and EPF: Overlapping services

What is NPS Vatsalaya?

Latest NPS rules, news: In the Union Budget 2024 speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced two new initiatives with regard to National Pension Scheme (NPS) - extension of NPS 14% employer contribution benefits to private setcor and the intended launch of NPS Vatsalya.Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries, bringing it at par with the provisions available for government employees.Sriram Iyer, CEO, HDFC Pension Management told ET that with this move the “ground rules have been harmonised among government and non-government employees, which is a positive step.”Effectively, this means that now, private-sector employees can choose to reduce the taxable portion of employers’ contribution to their NPS corpus, thereby paying less tax and leaving greater funds in their pension deposits.“Employees will benefit from tax savings . More importantly, the 40% increase in contribution will have a significant impact on the terminal value of the retirement corpus,” remarked Iyer. The extended savings will “help in retirement planning, working as an option that is at par with the Provident Fund,” Dinesh Rohira, CEO & Founder, 5nance.com was quoted as saying.Moreover, the endeavour aims to increase NPS penetration by increasing tax incentives for the private sector, providing them a social security-cushion post-retirement.The scheme’s motive to widen the NPS subscriber base may not prove to be flawlessly effective, however. This is explained by Agrees Mrin Agarwal, Founder, Finsafe India: “While it’s good that the limit has been raised, it may not increase adoption as employees need to be educated in a big way. Also, the benefit is only for the salaried opting for the new tax regime,” she says.The mandatory contribution to the EPF, too, threatens to relegate the provisions of NPS under the umbrella of near-superfluity. This sentiment is echoed by Varun Sahay, a software engineer in a Delhi-based IT company: “When 12% of my salary is already deducted for the EPF, why should I put in more in the NPS and cut my take-home pay?”Rohira feels otherwise. “There’s no competition between the NPS and EPF as employees can contribute to both and build a 3-4 times bigger corpus while earning 3-4% higher returns via marketlinked options in the NPS,” he counters.Also Check | New Tax Regime 2023 vs 2024 After Budget: How Much Income Tax Will Salaried Taxpayers Save & How Do New Tax Slabs Compare To Old Regime? Top 10 Points You Must Know To jumpstart retirement savings for children, a new initiative called NPS Vatsalya has been unveiled in the Budget. This scheme allows parents and guardians to contribute to a minor's account, which can be converted into a regular NPS account once the child reaches adulthood.""It provides a very long duration for reaping the compounding benefits and accumulating a huge bounty at a later age. This can be a good way to plan a better future for kids who may not opt for a service segment in the future,"" says Rohira. Sriram Iyer agrees, stating, ""It’s a good move to help the child start his retirement journey. Even if a parent starts when the child is 10 years old, by the time he starts working, it can be a solid foundation for the compounding journey after that.""However, some experts question the utility of a product with such a long lock-in period, especially when parents cannot use the funds for essential goals like their child’s education amidst soaring education costs of 11-12%.""Parents are struggling to save for their own retirement, so it might be a bit of a stretch to expect them to save for their kids’ retirement. The need of the hour is a market-linked product that allows withdrawals only for the child’s education,"" says Mrin Agarwal, Founder of Finsafe India.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? Though the NPS permits partial withdrawals, it allows only 25% of the corpus after three years of joining, and this can be done only three times during the entire tenure. A premature exit before 60 years with 100% withdrawal is only possible if the corpus is less than Rs.2.5 lakh, an amount insufficient for most children's goals.""In its current form, there won’t be any uptake,"" asserts Agarwal. Rohira concurs, ""It’s a vanilla product with a lock-in, which does not make it very attractive and it may not take off. However, the government may optimise it and introduce new features later."" Iyer adds, ""This is just a start and there may be more subscriber-friendly features as we take it to the market. The regulator is proactive and open to feedback.""","Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries.

Gold import duty cut: Why Indians may not find buying gold from Dubai as attractive post Budget 2024,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-import-duty-cut-why-indians-may-not-find-buying-gold-from-dubai-as-attractive-post-budget-2024/articleshow/112097671.cms,"Gold import duty cut: Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group, estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India.

Gold import duty cut in Budget 2024: The recent reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai. Indian jewellers with stores in both India and the UAE believe that the narrowed duty differential will result in lower gold prices in India, making it less attractive for Indians to purchase gold in Dubai.The emirate had attracted gold-enthusiast Indians following a steep rise in customs duty in India in July 2022. In the fiscal 2024-25 budget, the duty on gold imports was more than halved.The duty cut is also expected to boost gold jewellery production in India, particularly the popular 'Kolkatti' jewellery from Kolkata, which is favored by Indian expats in Dubai and tourists from various countries. This move will encourage gold artisans to create new designs in both heavyweight and lightweight jewellery, attracting consumers to purchase gold from India.According to an ET report, Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group , estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India as Indian tourists who previously bought jewellery in Dubai will now prefer to shop in India. However, Indian expats living in Dubai and other customers may continue to buy from the UAE.Also Read | Gold losing sheen?

He points out that the labour cost is significantly lower in India, and with the introduction of mandatory hallmarking and HUID numbers, the purity of gold in India is no longer a concern.Furthermore, NRIs in Dubai do not receive VAT refunds, and Indians travelling abroad only receive about 60% of the VAT back on their gold purchases. Gold trade analyst Bhargav Baidya suggests that the 1% duty differential between gold jewellery in India and Dubai will be offset by Indian jewellers offering discounts to retain and attract customers.Saurabh Gadgil, chairman of PNG Jewellers, notes that Indian import duty is now on par with the US, allowing Indian jewellers to offer competitive prices compared to other countries worldwide. The reduced customs duty is expected to make gold purchases in India more attractive and convenient for Indian consumers, potentially leading to a significant shift in their gold shopping preferences.","The reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers.

Gold Bonds losing sheen

Gold losing sheen? The government has reduced its target for issuing gold bonds in the financial year 2024-25 by 38% compared to the previous interim budget goal, according to a senior official. The revised target stands at Rs 18,500 crore, down from Rs 29,638 crore estimated in the interim budget and Rs 26,852 crore (revised estimate) in 2023-24.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told ET ""The decision followed a reassessment of various factors, including investor demand, other investment products and uncertainties around the global economy, as the situation has changed since the interim budget in February.""After accounting for redemptions, the net issuances of sovereign gold bonds are now estimated at Rs 15,000 crore for this fiscal year, a significant decrease from the Rs 26,138 crore projected in the interim budget and Rs 25,352 crore in the revised estimate for 2023-24.Harish Galipelli, director at ILA Commodities India, attributed this shift to retail investors increasingly opting for equities in anticipation of better returns. He also noted that people are uncertain about the potential for further increases in gold prices in the short-to-medium term following a recent rally. Additionally, Galipelli pointed out that savings in rural areas have been impacted by retail inflation and other factors.The gold bond and gold monetisation schemes were introduced by the government in late 2015 to discourage the physical purchase of precious metals and reduce imports, thereby mitigating the negative impact on the current account deficit.The gross collection through these two schemes is now projected to be Rs 20,030 crore in 2024-25, compared to Rs 31,168 crore in the interim budget and Rs 28,240 crore (revised estimate) in the previous fiscal year. Similarly, the net collection is estimated at Rs 16,433 crore, down from Rs 27,571 crore in the interim budget and Rs 26,653 crore in the previous year. However, the estimates for the gold monetisation scheme remain unchanged from the interim budget level.Also Read | Budget 2024: Duty cuts on gold, silver, platinum, and diamonds to make jewellery more affordable The sovereign gold bond scheme targets investors who view gold as an investment, encouraging them to purchase paper gold instead of physical gold.On the other hand, the gold monetisation scheme aims to bring out idle gold held by households, temple trusts, and others to increase domestic supply. Both schemes were designed to curb gold imports, which, along with crude oil, have been significant contributors to India's current account deficit.

These women take apart those big yellow machines,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/these-women-take-apart-those-big-yellow-machines/articleshow/113991499.cms,"The big yellow machines such as cement mixers used in the construction industry have traditionally been the preserve of men. But last month Schwing Stetter India, which makes them, turned things on their head. The company launched its first-ever all-women service centre at Poonamallee, Chennai, staffed by 17 skilled technicians (all aged between 20 and 25).It’s an attempt to do in sales and service what it has already kicked off in manufacturing – bring in gender equality across its operations, including in blue-collar jobs.“We envision having 50% women in our workforce across all divisions by 2047,” says V G Sakthikumar, CMD, Schwing Stetter India. “Inspiring the next generation of women engineers and technicians is pivotal to shaping India’s infrastructure landscape, and we want to lead the way,” he adds.At the new service centre, the all-women team will service and overhaul a range of concrete pumps and mixers. Their responsibilities will include everything from troubleshooting component malfunctions and carrying out preventive maintenance to providing comprehensive machine servicing. Since the inauguration of the service centre, three machines have been serviced, including two seven-cubic-metre transit mixers and one stationary pump. “The requirements for the machines have been gearbox and hydraulic system related,” said a member of the Poonamallee team. The work includes taking out workable parts from old machines and re-incorporating them into a new one as part of the refurbishment process.“The all-women service centre is a testament to our belief in the capabilities of women in manufacturing and infrastructure sectors,” says Sakthikumar. “We wanted to show that a construction equipment company can have part of its operations run entirely by women,” he adds.The company has also been steadily increasing the number of women in its factory floor operations. “Our new plant at Sipcot Cheyyar started operations in 2021, and already women make up 28% of our factory assembly line,” he says. Of them, 70% are from Tamil Nadu, while the rest are from Kerala, Jharkhand, Odisha, and West Bengal. Currently, welding, assembly line, quality, service, and spares divisions have all become gender neutral. The company also invites top engineering institutions such as VIT, SRM, and Anna University to offer engineering courses and degree certification on its premises, allowing a section of the women workforce to become full-fledged engineers as well.“The factory experience with the women workforce has been very good, with one woman employee winning the national award for welding as well,” says Sakthikumar. “What we started in production three years ago, we are now expanding to sales and service as well,” he adds.Will Schwing Stetter have more all-women service centres? The company aims to open similar facilities across India, and the numbers will depend upon customer feedback. “If the customer experience is good, we will take this concept forward very quickly,” says Sakthikumar. Like the factory workers – who have a women’s hostel nearby and company buses for commute – the service centre is also incorporating a women-friendly work environment, from sanitary pad vending machines to the centre itself being conveniently located next to the Tuticorin bypass. The company provides transportation and other support services, including on-site medical assistance. In the typically macho world of the big yellow machines, the women of Poonamallee are pioneers of sorts.","Schwing Stetter India launched its first-ever all-women service centre at Poonamallee, Chennai.

It will have a production capacity of around 11,000 tonnes per annum in the first phase. Food and fruit juices will follow in the next phase.Production will begin in fiscal 2025-26, says Rahul Awasthi, global head of operations, Dabur India. “We have outlined an approved phase-1 investment of 135 crore, which will be scaled up to 400 crore over five years. This is expected to generate direct employment for around 250 people,” he says.“Logistically, Tindivanam is strategically placed in the centre of three of our major depots in south India. So, it is ideal from depot delivered cost and serviceability perspectives. This unit will enhance our sourcing of agricultural produce from farmers in Tamil Nadu,” adds Awasthi.Another major entrant in Tindivanam is Greenlam Industries, which set up India’s single largest plywood manufacturing unit there in June 2023. With a capacity of 18.9 million sqm per year, it makes only ‘MikasaPly’, available across southern India and Goa.“Recognising its immense untapped potential, we are taking steps to market Villupuram,” says industries minister T R B Rajaa. “With its unique geographical advantage, the district can become a top manufacturing destination,” he says.“Villupuram can be gateway to a new delta industrial ecosystem, mainly in agro and food processing. We are confident more investors will realize the advantages Villupuram and nearby districts offer,” adds Rajaa.“We expect Villupuram will become an important zone for food processing industries, including seafood because Marakkanam along ECR offers the opportunity,” says K Senthil Raj, managing director of State Industries Promotion Corporation of Tamil Nadu (Sipcot). “We are eyeing industries that can use local agriculture produce,” he adds.Known as the ‘sugar bowl of Tamil Nadu’, it is predominantly an agriculture district with paddy, groundnut, sugarcane, tapioca, millet and pulses the major crops. Cheyyar SEZ developers, a subsidiary of the Taiwan-based Feng Tay Group, was the first major international player to enter Villupuram. Its facility at Tindivanam makes footwear for global brand Crocs.Now, Tamil Nadu Small Industries Development Corporation (Tansidco) is setting up a 155 crore pharma cluster on 113 acres on the western side of Tindivanam, off Tindivanam-Tiruvannamalai Road. It will house more than 30 companies, including large pharmaceutical manufacturers such as Apex Laboratories and Esjay Pharma, say Tansidco sources. “The DPR estimated that the cluster will attract 1,250 crore worth of investments. But, going forward the investments are likely to touch 2,000 crore-2,500 crore,” says a Tansidco official.Pharma firm Sai Mirra Innopharm is setting up a manufacturing unit in the cluster. Its founder J Jayaseelan, says, “The location was identified because Chennai airport and seaports are easily accessible. Villupuram is centrally located within the pharma manufacturing hubs of Chengalpet, Kancheepuram, Cuddalore and Puducherry. This cluster is going to be a gamechanger for growth of the pharma industry in Tamil Nadu.”“Establishing modern logistics hubs and warehousing facilities in Tindivanam will improve supply chain efficiencies and reduce transportation costs,” says Srivats Ram, chairman, CII Tamil Nadu state council, and managing director, Wheels India. “In addition, strengthening the power grid and promoting renewable energy projects within the district can attract energy-intensive industries, such as chemicals and textiles,” he adds.",Villupuram is emerging as a dark horse on the state’s industrial landscape. FMCG major Dabur India is breaking ground for its first factory in south India at Tindivanam by the end of 2024.

European Union approves tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/european-union-approves-tariffs-on-chinese-electric-vehicles/articleshow/113962628.cms,"The European Union on Friday approved substantial tariffs on electric vehicles imported from China, despite strong resistance led by Germany and concerns about triggering a trade war with Beijing. The EU now has the authority to impose tariffs for a period of five years starting from the end of October in addition to the existing 10% duties.According to several European diplomats, ten member states, including France, Italy, and Poland, supported the imposition of the tariffs while five countries, including Germany and Hungary, voted against the measure, while twelve others, such as Spain and Sweden, abstained from voting.France supports the tariffs, arguing that they are necessary to create a level playing field for EU carmakers against their Chinese competitors. However, Germany, known for its robust auto industry and key manufacturers such as BMW, Volkswagen, and Mercedes, which have heavily invested in China, believes that the EU risks harming itself with tariffs and has called for continued negotiations with Beijing.Spain, initially supportive of the tariffs, has also reversed its stance, with Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez requesting that Brussels reconsider. Hungary has also been vocal in its opposition to the tariffs, with Prime Minister Viktor Orban describing them as ""the next step in the economic cold war.""These additional duties will also be imposed on electric vehicles manufactured in China by foreign companies like Tesla, which faces a 7.8 percent tariff.The EU's primary objective behind this decision is to safeguard its automotive industry, which employs approximately 14 million people across the bloc but lacks the substantial state subsidies provided in China. In comparison, Canada and the United States have recently imposed significantly higher tariffs of 100 percent on Chinese electric car imports.Earlier, the the group provisionally approved the measure in June following an investigation that found China's state aid to auto manufacturers to be unfair.With the decision now in the hands of the European Commission, an EU diplomat stated that the Commission ""can be expected to decide in line with its proposal.""Meanwhile, China has criticized the new tariffs as ""protectionist"" and cautioned that they would lead to a trade war. Beijing has already initiated probes into European brandy, dairy, and pork products imported into the country.Despite China's efforts to resolve the issue through dialogue, talks have not yet led to an agreement that satisfies the EU.The Commission has indicated that the duties could be lifted if China addresses the EU's concerns.Additionally, the trade tensions between China and the EU extend beyond electric cars, with Brussels also launching inquiries into Chinese subsidies for solar panels and wind turbines. The bloc faces a challenging task as it attempts to nurture its clean tech industry and invest in the green transition without triggering a costly trade war with China.","The European Union approved substantial tariffs on electric vehicles imported from China.

Oil Prices: What's next for oil and gas prices as Middle East tensions heat up?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/whats-next-for-oil-and-gas-prices-as-middle-east-tensions-heat-up/articleshow/113963132.cms,"Oil prices rise as tensions between Iran and Israel escalate, with concerns about potential disruptions in the Middle East. Gas prices see a slight increase but remain lower than last year. Experts argue that ample supply and tepid demand could keep prices stable. Anticipated Israeli actions on Iranian oil facilities add to geopolitical uncertainty.

Here's a look at the current situation and the outlook for oil and gas prices:

Gasoline prices effected

Iran's oil sector produces 3.99 million

What's next for oil prices?

Oil prices climbed this week as tensions in the Middle East escalated. Iran launched missiles at Israel and the Israelis threatened retaliation, raising the possibility of a disruption to the flow of oil from the region. A jump in oil prices automatically spurs fear of a spike in gas prices , but experts see reasons that may not happen.Familiar tensions, different times Oil prices rose than $6 per barrel (5.47 euros) this week and prices at the pump moved higher as well.The average price for a gallon of gas rose 5 cents from last week. Any major escalation of tensions in the Middle East conjures up memories of the oil embargo that followed the start of the Yom Kippur war in 1973, which quadrupled oil prices.However, the global supply of oil has been altered radically since the 1970s, with the U.S. becoming the world's largest oil producer. Months of war between Israel and Hamas and Hezbollah, two Iranian proxies, did little to boost prices for OPEC and its 12 oil-producing nations. Only the possibility of a direct confrontation between Israel and Iran moved the needle.Gasoline prices are up, but cheaper than last year US gas prices typically rise along with crude because the price of oil makes up half the cost of a gallon of gasoline.The national average for gas has risen to about $3.18 per gallon, according to AAA. But that's still 13 cents less than a month ago and 60 cents less than a year ago. The record national average high of $5 per gallon was reached in June 2022.""Despite the threat of war and a hurricane season that is still percolating, domestic gasoline prices are edging lower,"" AAA spokesperson Andrew Gross said in a statement on Thursday. ""There are now 18 states east of the Rockies with averages below $3 a gallon.""AAA also estimates that approximately 1.2 million of its members live in households with one or more electric vehicles. The organization believes that tepid gas demand and low oil costs will likely keep prices at gas pumps sliding.It's the fundamentals The long-term expectation is for oil prices to move lower, not higher. That's because the balance between supply and demand has tilted toward supply, a dynamic that typically weighs on oil prices.In its most recent update on the energy markets, the International Energy Agency said demand for oil in the first half of this year rose by the smallest amount since 2020. Meanwhile, supplies have continued to increase and the OPEC+ alliance, made up of members of the producers cartel and allied countries including Russia, has said it plans to release more oil into the market starting in December.""Geopolitical tensions have soared of late and yet fundamentals seem to be moving in the opposite direction with Iranian oil exports trending close to the highest level in years,"" Barclays analyst Amarpreet Singh said in a note to clients. ""The jury is out on the primary driver of the geopolitical drift, but it warrants caution against taking a strong view on a sustained disruption.""State of Iran's oil sector The country produces 3.99 million barrels per day, which is 4% of the world total. By comparison, Saudi Arabia produces about 9 million barrels a day.Despite sanctions imposed by the West that have hampered production and export levels, Iran continues to find ways to maintain its oil sector, sometimes using creative methods like blending and re-labeling oil for sale to markets like China. As of the middle of this year, Iran was exporting about 2 million barrels of oil a day, up from 500,000 in 2020 but below the 2.5 million barrels it exported each day in 2018.Export terminals like Kharg Island in the Persian Gulf could be a target for an Israeli strike. They play a key role in shipping crude oil abroad, primarily to Asian countries, including China.Oil prices rose Thursday after President Joe Biden said US and Israeli officials were discussing a possible Israeli strike on Iranian oil facilities. On Friday, Biden said the exact nature of any retaliatory action by Israel was ""under discussion."" But he added, ""I think if I were in their shoes, I'd be thinking about other alternatives than striking oil fields.""Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis with the Oil Price Information Service, believes oil prices are approaching a top, with US crude oil at $74.38 and Brent crude, the international benchmark, at $78.05. ""Perhaps Brent may have a cup of coffee at $80 a barrel or higher,"" he wrote in an email, but the long-term outlook is for lower prices.""As soon as things calm down, oil traders will concentrate on 2025 and 2025 looks very problematic for high prices with supply almost certainly outpacing demand by 500,000 to 1 million barrels a day,"" Kloza said.","Oil prices rise as tensions between Iran and Israel escalate, with concerns about potential disruptions in the Middle East.
