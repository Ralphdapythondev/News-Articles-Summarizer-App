Later that day, the return journey, train number 94801 Ahmedabad-Bhuj Vande Metro, will depart from Ahmedabad at 5:30 PM and reach Bhuj at 11:10 PM, completing the trip in 5 hours and 40 minutes.During its journey, the train will make stops at various stations, including Anjar, Gandhidham, Bhachau, Samakhiali, Halvad, Dhrangadhra, Viramgam, Chandlodiya, and Sabarmati.The train will run on 6 days of the week. While train number 94802 will not run on Sunday, train number 94801 will not run on Saturday.Commuters will be able to access the regular service starting from September 17, with the train departing from Ahmedabad. The entire trip will have a fare of Rs 455.The Vande Metro is designed to provide passengers with a 'world-class' travel experience. The first rake has been manufactured at ICF, Chennai. Vande Metro is intended to replace the existing mainline EMUs on Indian Railways, offering a metro-like experience with seating and standing options for passengers. The 12 coach train can accommodate 1,150 passengers while sitting and 2,058 standing passengers.The Vande Metro boasts an array of features, including a top speed of 130 kmph, enhanced acceleration and deceleration capabilities, and fully sealed gangways that allow for easier movement between coaches while maintaining a dust-free environment. Passengers can enjoy comfortable seats and a fully air-conditioned interior, ensuring a pleasant journey.The train is equipped with automatic entry/exit doors, the KAVACH train anti-collision system, mobile charging sockets, and wide panoramic sealed windows with roller blinds for passenger convenience and safety. Additionally, CCTV cameras and emergency talk-back units are installed for enhanced security. The Vande Metro also features modular toilets with a vacuum evacuation system, further elevating the travel experience.","The first Vande Metro all air-conditioned train service of Indian Railways will run between Ahmedabad and Bhuj in Gujarat.

Bajaj Housing Finance multibagger listing: Should investors who missed the IPO buy Bajaj Housing shares now?

So I would rather buy the other housing companies - PNB Housing, LIC Housing - rather than try to buy now. If you are lucky enough to have gotten the IPO, then I would be a seller on listing.""Prashanth Tapse of Mehta Equities advised, ""Post listing, we recommend conservative investors to choose profit booking, as listing gain is over and above our expectations, while long-term investors can continue holding for long-term growth as the sector outlook remains very optimistic given the company's well-positioned business model. We believe housing as a sector will continue to deliver and perform well in the next 3-4 years and Bajaj Housing can tap the opportunity to lead the sector.""He noted that at the issue price of Rs 70 per share, Bajaj Finance shares were valued at 3x P/BV, but post-listing, the valuations have stretched to 6x P/BV, the highest in the industry.Shivani Nyati, Head of Wealth at Swastika Investmart, advised investors who secured allotments in the IPO to consider booking profits now. However, those who wish to hold their positions may do so by setting a stop loss at Rs 135 as a risk management strategy.Nyati emphasized the importance of continuously monitoring the company's performance and market conditions to make informed decisions.Deven Choksey, managing director of DRChoksey FinServ, expressed his belief that investors who hold the stock for a decade ""will be most wealthy."" Similarly, Prathamesh Masdekar from Stoxbox recommended investors to keep the stock for the medium-to-long term.Narendra Solanki of Anand Rathi pointed out that most housing finance companies trade at an estimated P/B ratio of 1-2.5 times.

""We are also considering the difficult step of temporary furloughs for many employees, managers and executives in the coming weeks,"" West said, adding, ""this strike jeopardizes our recovery in a significant way.""The company plans to reduce spending on suppliers and stop most supplier purchase orders related to the 737, 767, and 777 airplane models.The strike, which began early Friday, involves approximately 33,000 workers represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. The walkout occurred after workers rejected a proposed 25 per cent pay increase over four years, with the union initially seeking a pay hike of at least 40 per cent.Striking workers are picketing at various locations in Washington state, Oregon, and California in the US.The bonuses, which workers say range from $3,000 to $5,000 a year, have become a point of contention. Boeing argues that it is difficult to calculate bonuses fairly for 33,000 employees with different roles and instead proposes replacing the payouts with automatic contributions of $4,160 per year to each employee's 401(k) retirement account. Workers are also frustrated that over the past 16 years, Boeing has ended its traditional pension plan and reduced health care benefits through contract extensions.Boeing has faced significant financial challenges, losing more than $25 billion since the start of 2019 and burning through $4.3 billion in the second quarter of 2024 alone. The strike is expected to delay deliveries of new planes, which are a crucial source of cash for the company.Despite Stephanie Pope, the head of Boeing's commercial-airplanes division, urging workers to accept the contract offer last week, workers rejected the recommendation of their own leaders for the first time since 1995.Additional cost-cutting measures outlined in the CFO's memo include eliminating first- and business-class service for critical travel and halting spending on outside consultants.","Boeing has announced a series of measures ""to preserve cash and safeguard future"" The company plans to reduce spending on suppliers and stop most supplier purchase orders related to the 737, 767, and 777 airplane models.

Railway Budget 2024 : The government has wavered little in its efforts to spur a modernisation of railways in the country, pivoting on technology, to support the country’s economic ambitions. In line with expectations, Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore, marking yet another year of successive increase in outlay.That takes forward the past policies and the government’s vision, which have paved the way for modernisation of the transport behemoth.In earlier decades, the government had focused on laying tracks on new routes, electrification and incremental rolling stock capacity addition. That was the need of the hour back then and has helped set up the base for a larger transformation.For instance, the massive Dedicated Freight Corridor ( DFC ) as well as locomotive factories at Marhaura and Madhepura in Bihar were conceptualised over a decade ago and we are seeing their completion now.More recently, the focus has shifted to modernisation—of rolling stock and safety systems, among other aspects.This year, emphasis has also been laid on the railways’ crucial role in industrial development. Commodity-specific corridors have been planned in eastern India and impetus given to port connectivity. Vande Bharat and technology-led upgrades in rolling stock remain in focus. Safety has been prioritised through budgetary allocations for the anti-collision systemKavach . That said, there are other cogs in the wheel that demand attention from a long-term perspective.First, the target for the Operating Ratio, the crucial efficiency gauge, has been set at 98.22% for 2024-25, compared with 98.65% in 2023-24. This reflects an imminent need for operational transformation. An effective overhaul of the world’s fourth-largest rail network will take many years and thus we need to start focusing on improving efficiency and reducing costs now.DFC is almost entirely operational and will be complete over the next few months. To ensure the project achieves its twin goals of reducing logistics costs and enhancing freight efficiency, railways need to attract more cargo on the corridor. This will help increase the rail coefficient and make the railways’ approach more market-oriented, which will in turn aid future corridors.A revamp of railway stations is on track, with sufficient funds dedicated to this end. But even though new coaches and wagons are increasingly being added to meet footfalls, the stations and passenger trains themselves remain synonymous with chaos.Just as safety, comfort and convenience have been prioritised, there is a need for solutions to address the capacity and demand challenges. As a first step, the government could target development of new stations and setting up of new coach production units.As a leading freight mover, Indian Railways carried a record 1,588 MT cargo in fiscal 2024, up from 1,095 MT in fiscal 2015. It accounts for 26% of the cargo moved in the country—by no means an easy feat. The railways aims to take this volume to 3,000 MT by 2030, which would require a 11% CAGR against the around 4.2% witnessed over the last 10 years. As per a report by TERI and Shakti Foundation, from carrying about 62% of freight traffic in 1990-91, Indian Railways’ share has declined to ~27% in 2014-15. This has been due to the expanding road network, cost competitiveness over railways, and door-to-door service. Thus, commencing the cycle of increasing the rail share again is commendable.DFCs, a high-capacity track network, high-power locomotives and improvement in wagon designs have set the ball rolling for larger capacity, faster freight trains that deliver better efficiency.Yet, achieving exponential growth is a tall ask given the current dynamics. Possibly, similar challenges might apply to other goals the railways might have for 2047.To be fair, despite its scale and complexity, Indian Railways has been able to achieve diverse developments at commendable speed.But the track ahead is long and it is time to start discussing the reinvention of the institutional set-up.Indian Railways sees substantial private sector involvement in the form of vendors and contractors. Policymakers could start mulling extreme options such as parallel privately-owned and operated railway infrastructure, coupled with centralised planning and an evolved role for the railways. This will need a robust policy framework from the Government of India.The time is perhaps also ripe to bring user charge and asset monetisation-driven segments for passengers as well as cargo to the discussion table. Globally, the separation of infrastructure and operations in railways has delivered mixed results, for example in the United Kingdom. The model should be analysed and revisited to understand its potential relevance in the Indian context.The key would be to retrace our steps and align our long-term goals to identify not just incremental changes but also ways to explore bold and path-breaking alternatives that put Indian Railways on a smooth track and bring it up to speed.","Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore. In earlier decades, the government had focused on laying tracks on new routes, electrification and incremental rolling stock capacity addition. This year, emphasis has also been laid on the railways’ crucial role in industrial development.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112317825,imgsize-144990,width-400,resizemode-4/112317825.jpg"

Budget 2024 capital gains tax changes: The Narendra Modi government is considering suggestions for tweaks in the new long term capital gains tax regime that was announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman in Union Budget 2024.The July 23 budget reduced the LTCG tax on property from 20% to 12.5%. The indexation benefit, which allowed taxpayers to adjust the acquisition cost for inflation before calculating capital gains and thus reduce their tax liability, is proposed to be eliminated for properties purchased on or after April 1, 2001.The government publishes the Cost Inflation Index (CII) annually for this calculation.India Inc is appealing to the government for a gradual shift to the long-term capital gains tax regime proposed in the FY25 budget, which aims to eliminate indexation benefits for property, gold, and other unlisted assets.According to an ET report by Deepshikha Sikarwar, the industry is suggesting alternatives such as a higher tax rate with indexation or a lower rate of 12.5% without indexation, as well as some form of grandfathering for ancestral properties.The finance ministry is currently reviewing these proposals and will discuss them with the Prime Minister's Office. The final decision will be made closer to the date when the Finance Bill reply is to be presented in Parliament, the reports said.Industry groups are expected to submit formal proposals to the finance ministry in the near future.

Budget 2024 for manufacturing sector : The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth. While the middle class has been offered tax relief, the government's primary focus remains on judicious spending to maximize economic impact. The budget's core themes are employment, skilling, MSME development, and support for the middle class.Largely focus has remained intact on spending money judiciously to ensure that each penny spent creates a ripple effect in the entire economic landscape.Although at first glance, manufacturing might appear to have taken a backseat, a deeper analysis reveals a multifaceted approach to bolstering the sector. Initiatives like employment-linked benefits and internship programs, while primarily aimed at job creation and skill development, indirectly benefit manufacturing companies by expanding the talent pool.Extensive focus on the MSME manufacturing units by way of extending term loan facility for purchase of machinery and equipment without collateral or third-party guarantee, would help companies in augmenting their capital base/ capacity and strengthen the very foundation of the manufacturing ecosystem in the country. Development of a new credit-assessment model by Public Sector Banks to assess MSME credit shall provide much needed regulatory relief to the units.With respect to the large manufacturing entities, while there is no direct fiscal/ tax incentive introduced in this budget, some support has been provided with an extensive focus on development of ‘industrial parks’ in nearly 100 cities under the ‘plug and play’ model. Reforms proposed with respect to land administration, planning and management, shall also ease out acquisition related difficulties often faced by entrepreneurs/ business houses in acquiring lands for manufacturing set-ups.Targeted Customs duty interventions like, rationalization of Customs duty provisions in Mobile phone manufacturing setups, extension of Customs duty exemption on import of capital goods for manufacturing of solar cells and panels, full Customs duty exemption on import of 25 critical minerals,, shall provide the required impetus for enhancing domestic manufacturing environment.Governments’ focus on formulating an Economic Policy Framework to set the scope for next-gen reforms in the country, has a target to improve the productivity of factors of production, namely, land, labour, capital, entrepreneurship and technology. This shall pave the way for enabling achievement of a target of 25% manufacturing sector contribution to the nation’s GDP over the course of next 7-10 years.While the overall outlook is positive, the extension of tax benefits under Section 115BAB for manufacturing entities and the absence of new PLI schemes are notable omissions.The country’s manufacturing base is expanding as is reflective from the continuously increasing tax collections and expanding Purchasing Manager’s Index. It would be pertinent to see how the ground realities evolve vis-à-vis the vision envisaged, in the upcoming Financial Year.","The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth.

Budget 2024: Armed with the vision to propel India to become a developed country by 2047, the Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business thereby providing the required stimulus to the manufacturing sector and enabling large scale job creation.On the Indirect tax front, the industry welcomes the much-needed announcement for a comprehensive review of the rate structure under Customs enabling ease in product classification and dispute reduction.The proposal of lowering of Customs duty on a plethora of raw materials and products including solar cells, critical minerals and bullion are encouraging measures. The rationale behind such reduction clearly indicates support towards domestic manufacturing, deepening value addition and supporting targets in reducing carbon footprint.Relevant amendments under the Customs law have been made to provide increased time limits for re-imports and re-exports to enhance competitiveness of the fledgling MRO sector. The government has extended significant duty reduction and exemption benefits to the healthcare and electronics sectors, continuing the impetus of incentives provided under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme.Since their introduction in March 2020, the PLI schemes have indeed supported in revitalizing the manufacturing sector and strengthening the necessary supply chains. The success achieved in the mobile manufacturing sector has now enabled the Government to reduce customs duties on mobile phones and components, signalling a mature environment. The Budget proposals aim at reproducing similar outcomes for semiconductor and pharmaceutical industry by increasing the budgetary allocation.Buoyed by the increasing revenue collection under GST signalling a shift towards a mature tax regime, this Budget has harmonized the timeframes for the issuance of demand notices and adjudication orders for cases involving fraud, suppression or otherwise. Significant amendments to the GST legislations have been introduced reflecting the recommendations proposed by the GST Council such as regularizing non-levy of GST due to general practice which may turn out to be a breather for certain impacted industries reeling under huge tax demands.The Insurance sector has been provided much relief through the GST council recommendations which have been cemented in the present budget thereby ending long standing disputes on their business practices.The Government's efforts to push forward with its reform agenda are evident as plans to incentivize states for their business reform actions plans and digitalization through the Jan Vishwas Bill 2.0 is proposed. Further, setting up of e-commerce export hubs is envisaged to facilitate easier access to international markets for domestic players.The recent implementation of Budget proposals allows the government to maintain momentum in its reform agenda. These policy measures implicitly reaffirm the significance of India Inc as a crucial element in the development of infrastructure. However, there are still some expectations required to be met to march towards a Viksit Bharat 2047.",The Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business.

Budget 2024 : Real estate, a significant contributor to employment generation, has received a fair bit of attention in Budget 2024-25. Recent years have seen the sector transform rapidly, driven by factors such as favourable government policies, Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, strong economic growth and changing consumer preferences.Added to that, the budgetary focus on job creation, skilling and employment-linked incentives, infrastructure, urban development, rural connectivity, digitalisation and land-related norms, all dovetail to promote growth of the sector.Launched in June 2015, the PMAY aims to provide affordable housing to all eligible beneficiaries. The budget unveiled PMAY Urban 2.0, under which the housing needs of 1 crore urban poor and middle class will be addressed with an investment of Rs 10 lakh crore.The central government’s additional Rs 2.2 lakh crore injection in the next 5 years to make housing more affordable has the potential to revitalise the affordable housing market.Such an approach can play an important role in realising the government's vision of Housing for All and push growth and development. Hence, the significant investment under PMAY Urban 2.0 is expected to alleviate urban housing deficits, spurring construction and economic growth.Steps to introduce technological reforms within the regulatory framework for land, such as digitalisation or GIS mapping of land records, will improve transparency.Rationalisation of stamp duty across states will also be critical to bring in uniformity and initiate land-related reforms such as urban planning, usage and building bylaws.These are steps in the right direction and will boost growth. Moreover, they will improve the ease of property transactions and strengthen municipal finances through increased property taxes. Rationalization of stamp duty with an emphasis on women homebuyers may boost home-buyer sentiment in major cities, too.The budget has also given ample attention to urban and rural development, with rental housing for industrial workers through the public private partnership model, interest subsidies for rental housing, and transit-oriented developments.The proposal to develop investment-ready plug-and-play industrial parks in 100 cities may attract industrial investment, leading to increased demand for industrial real estate and support the growth of ancillary services and residential developments in these regions.Initiatives for industrial parks and rental housing for industrial workers align with the country’s manufacturing goals and addresses worker accommodation needs.These steps are expected to promote industrial growth and stability in labour-intensive sectors, while also creating new opportunities for real estate developers specialising in rental and affordable housing.The changes in long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax, however, have evoked a mixed reaction. The government lowered the long-term capital gains tax from 20% to 12.5%, which is a welcome step. However, this came with the removal of the indexation benefit.The changes could encourage more liquidity in property transactions and potentially increase the effective tax burden depending on the property’s acquisition date.The launch of Phase IV of the PM Gram Sadak Yojana in 25,000 rural habitations will improve connectivity in rural areas, promoting rural development and making these regions more accessible for investment. The primary objective of PMGSY is to build robust, all-weather roads in rural habitations. This initiative focuses on enhancing connectivity and supporting economic development in rural areas.In essence, the budget is geared towards stimulating growth and investment in the real estate sector , fostering a more transparent and investor-friendly environment, and contributing to overall development. It aims to create a balanced and inclusive growth environment by addressing the needs of various segments, including affordable housing, industrial workers and urban infrastructure.The effectiveness of the initiatives, however, hinges on their implementation and continued support of complementary reforms.","Budget 2024-25 is geared towards stimulating growth and investment in the real estate sector.

New Budget 2024 rule: Why Income Tax Department is likely to issue a huge number of tax notices this month,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-budget-2024-rule-why-income-tax-department-is-likely-to-issue-a-huge-number-of-tax-notices-this-month/articleshow/112186079.cms,"Taxing Times

Income Tax Notice on the way? The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month, as there are concerns that many taxpayers might escape the tax net due to the impending implementation of the new reassessment law on September 1, 2024.According to the amended regulation announced in Budget 2024 , the tax authorities can only go back a maximum of five years to reassess a taxpayer's records if the escaped income is at least Rs 50 lakh, and three years for an amount less than Rs 50 lakh.Previously, they could reassess cases up to 10 years old.According to an ET report, tax officials are now faced with the challenge of compiling and corroborating data on tax and income mismatches for the financial years 2013-14 to 2017-18 within the next few weeks, as these years will become time-barred for reassessment from September 1, 2024.The I-T department relies on information from various sources, such as banks, property registrars, and search findings from the investigation wing, to build reassessment cases.A tax officers' body has raised concerns about the feasibility of issuing notices under Section 148 (or 148A) in a large number of cases within a single month, given the overburdened nature of the jurisdictional assessing officers and the time-consuming process of obtaining sanction from the chief commissioner, who is the specified authority for such notices.Moreover, the law provides taxpayers with the right to explain their position before reassessment orders are finalized, a process that most believe cannot be completed by the end of August.Also Read | ITR refund status for FY 2023-24: How to check income tax refund status online - here’s a step-by-step guide for incometax.gov.in & NSDL websites The Central Board of Direct Taxes ( CBDT ) has been urged by its officers to postpone the effective date of the proposed amendment. However, this suggestion is unlikely to be well-received by corporations and high net worth individuals.""Capping the reassessment period at five years was a great decision as it would reduce hassles and litigation. But if the department fears there could be a genuine loss of revenue as it may not be possible to wrap up several matters by August 31, the government can think of strict parameters where time-bound cases can be selectively reopened - based on trails of steps taken in identifying escaped income,"" said Mitil Chokshi, partner at CA firm Chokshi & Chokshi.""Taxpayers may expect a rush of reassessment notices in August 2024. These notices are likely to be for the AYs 2018-19 and prior to that. It is pertinent to note that the Bombay High Court in a recent ruling in a case of Hexaware Technologies has taken a view on a proviso introduced in 2021, which can be interpreted to mean that AY 2017-18 (and prior years) got time barred on March 31, 2024. These reassessment notices (for AYs 2017-18 and prior) are likely to rake up new interpretation issues in the already muddled reassessment provisions,"" said Ashish Mehta, partner at law firm Khaitan & Co.The current situation is similar to the conflict between the Income Tax office and taxpayers in 2021. The reassessment law was amended in April 2021, allowing the tax office to reopen 10-year-old tax returns if the total undisclosed income exceeded Rs 50 lakh and reassess 4-year-old matters if the amount was less than Rs 50 lakh.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? However, this change led to over 10,000 writ petitions being filed by companies, arguing that they were not given sufficient time to explain and that the notices were issued without considering the carve-out that cases which couldn't be reopened earlier couldn't be reassessed under the new law.The Supreme Court invoked its extraordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution on May 4, 2022, to uphold all reassessment notices issued after March 31, 2021. However, the court left room for judicial proceedings based on the merits of each case, and several such matters are currently pending before the court.","The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month.

NPS and EPF: Overlapping services

What is NPS Vatsalaya?

Latest NPS rules, news: In the Union Budget 2024 speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced two new initiatives with regard to National Pension Scheme (NPS) - extension of NPS 14% employer contribution benefits to private setcor and the intended launch of NPS Vatsalya.Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries, bringing it at par with the provisions available for government employees.Sriram Iyer, CEO, HDFC Pension Management told ET that with this move the “ground rules have been harmonised among government and non-government employees, which is a positive step.”Effectively, this means that now, private-sector employees can choose to reduce the taxable portion of employers’ contribution to their NPS corpus, thereby paying less tax and leaving greater funds in their pension deposits.“Employees will benefit from tax savings . More importantly, the 40% increase in contribution will have a significant impact on the terminal value of the retirement corpus,” remarked Iyer. The extended savings will “help in retirement planning, working as an option that is at par with the Provident Fund,” Dinesh Rohira, CEO & Founder, 5nance.com was quoted as saying.Moreover, the endeavour aims to increase NPS penetration by increasing tax incentives for the private sector, providing them a social security-cushion post-retirement.The scheme’s motive to widen the NPS subscriber base may not prove to be flawlessly effective, however. This is explained by Agrees Mrin Agarwal, Founder, Finsafe India: “While it’s good that the limit has been raised, it may not increase adoption as employees need to be educated in a big way. Also, the benefit is only for the salaried opting for the new tax regime,” she says.The mandatory contribution to the EPF, too, threatens to relegate the provisions of NPS under the umbrella of near-superfluity. This sentiment is echoed by Varun Sahay, a software engineer in a Delhi-based IT company: “When 12% of my salary is already deducted for the EPF, why should I put in more in the NPS and cut my take-home pay?”Rohira feels otherwise. “There’s no competition between the NPS and EPF as employees can contribute to both and build a 3-4 times bigger corpus while earning 3-4% higher returns via marketlinked options in the NPS,” he counters.Also Check | New Tax Regime 2023 vs 2024 After Budget: How Much Income Tax Will Salaried Taxpayers Save & How Do New Tax Slabs Compare To Old Regime? Top 10 Points You Must Know To jumpstart retirement savings for children, a new initiative called NPS Vatsalya has been unveiled in the Budget. This scheme allows parents and guardians to contribute to a minor's account, which can be converted into a regular NPS account once the child reaches adulthood.""It provides a very long duration for reaping the compounding benefits and accumulating a huge bounty at a later age. This can be a good way to plan a better future for kids who may not opt for a service segment in the future,"" says Rohira. Sriram Iyer agrees, stating, ""It’s a good move to help the child start his retirement journey. Even if a parent starts when the child is 10 years old, by the time he starts working, it can be a solid foundation for the compounding journey after that.""However, some experts question the utility of a product with such a long lock-in period, especially when parents cannot use the funds for essential goals like their child’s education amidst soaring education costs of 11-12%.""Parents are struggling to save for their own retirement, so it might be a bit of a stretch to expect them to save for their kids’ retirement. The need of the hour is a market-linked product that allows withdrawals only for the child’s education,"" says Mrin Agarwal, Founder of Finsafe India.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? Though the NPS permits partial withdrawals, it allows only 25% of the corpus after three years of joining, and this can be done only three times during the entire tenure. A premature exit before 60 years with 100% withdrawal is only possible if the corpus is less than Rs.2.5 lakh, an amount insufficient for most children's goals.""In its current form, there won’t be any uptake,"" asserts Agarwal. Rohira concurs, ""It’s a vanilla product with a lock-in, which does not make it very attractive and it may not take off. However, the government may optimise it and introduce new features later."" Iyer adds, ""This is just a start and there may be more subscriber-friendly features as we take it to the market. The regulator is proactive and open to feedback.""","Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries.

Gold import duty cut: Why Indians may not find buying gold from Dubai as attractive post Budget 2024,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-import-duty-cut-why-indians-may-not-find-buying-gold-from-dubai-as-attractive-post-budget-2024/articleshow/112097671.cms,"Gold import duty cut in Budget 2024: The recent reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai. Indian jewellers with stores in both India and the UAE believe that the narrowed duty differential will result in lower gold prices in India, making it less attractive for Indians to purchase gold in Dubai.The emirate had attracted gold-enthusiast Indians following a steep rise in customs duty in India in July 2022. In the fiscal 2024-25 budget, the duty on gold imports was more than halved.The duty cut is also expected to boost gold jewellery production in India, particularly the popular 'Kolkatti' jewellery from Kolkata, which is favored by Indian expats in Dubai and tourists from various countries. This move will encourage gold artisans to create new designs in both heavyweight and lightweight jewellery, attracting consumers to purchase gold from India.According to an ET report, Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group , estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India as Indian tourists who previously bought jewellery in Dubai will now prefer to shop in India. However, Indian expats living in Dubai and other customers may continue to buy from the UAE.Also Read | Gold losing sheen?

He points out that the labour cost is significantly lower in India, and with the introduction of mandatory hallmarking and HUID numbers, the purity of gold in India is no longer a concern.Furthermore, NRIs in Dubai do not receive VAT refunds, and Indians travelling abroad only receive about 60% of the VAT back on their gold purchases. Gold trade analyst Bhargav Baidya suggests that the 1% duty differential between gold jewellery in India and Dubai will be offset by Indian jewellers offering discounts to retain and attract customers.Saurabh Gadgil, chairman of PNG Jewellers, notes that Indian import duty is now on par with the US, allowing Indian jewellers to offer competitive prices compared to other countries worldwide. The reduced customs duty is expected to make gold purchases in India more attractive and convenient for Indian consumers, potentially leading to a significant shift in their gold shopping preferences.",The reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai.

Government cuts gold bond issuance target as investors look at better alternatives,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-losing-sheen-government-cuts-gold-bond-issuance-target-as-investors-look-at-better-alternatives/articleshow/112035342.cms,"Gold Bonds losing sheen

Gold losing sheen? The government has reduced its target for issuing gold bonds in the financial year 2024-25 by 38% compared to the previous interim budget goal, according to a senior official. The revised target stands at Rs 18,500 crore, down from Rs 29,638 crore estimated in the interim budget and Rs 26,852 crore (revised estimate) in 2023-24.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told ET ""The decision followed a reassessment of various factors, including investor demand, other investment products and uncertainties around the global economy, as the situation has changed since the interim budget in February.""After accounting for redemptions, the net issuances of sovereign gold bonds are now estimated at Rs 15,000 crore for this fiscal year, a significant decrease from the Rs 26,138 crore projected in the interim budget and Rs 25,352 crore in the revised estimate for 2023-24.Harish Galipelli, director at ILA Commodities India, attributed this shift to retail investors increasingly opting for equities in anticipation of better returns. He also noted that people are uncertain about the potential for further increases in gold prices in the short-to-medium term following a recent rally. Additionally, Galipelli pointed out that savings in rural areas have been impacted by retail inflation and other factors.The gold bond and gold monetisation schemes were introduced by the government in late 2015 to discourage the physical purchase of precious metals and reduce imports, thereby mitigating the negative impact on the current account deficit.The gross collection through these two schemes is now projected to be Rs 20,030 crore in 2024-25, compared to Rs 31,168 crore in the interim budget and Rs 28,240 crore (revised estimate) in the previous fiscal year. Similarly, the net collection is estimated at Rs 16,433 crore, down from Rs 27,571 crore in the interim budget and Rs 26,653 crore in the previous year. However, the estimates for the gold monetisation scheme remain unchanged from the interim budget level.Also Read | Budget 2024: Duty cuts on gold, silver, platinum, and diamonds to make jewellery more affordable The sovereign gold bond scheme targets investors who view gold as an investment, encouraging them to purchase paper gold instead of physical gold.On the other hand, the gold monetisation scheme aims to bring out idle gold held by households, temple trusts, and others to increase domestic supply. Both schemes were designed to curb gold imports, which, along with crude oil, have been significant contributors to India's current account deficit. Gold bond issuances had moderated after reaching Rs 16,049 crore during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020-21, before experiencing a surge in 2023-24.","The government has reduced its target for issuing gold bonds in the financial year 2024-25 by 38% compared to the previous interim budget goal.

US Fed rate cut meeting date and time: How much interest cut is likely?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-fed-rate-cut-meeting-date-and-time-how-much-interest-cut-is-likely/articleshow/113402530.cms,"The Federal Reserve is expected to announce its first interest rate cut in over four years on Wednesday after the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting scheduled on September 17-18. The Fed Chair Jerome Powell will announced the outcome on Wednesday, September 18 around 11:30 PM Indian Standard Time (IST).Earlier, top Fed officials including chair Jerome Powell have signaled that a rate cut is imminent, as inflation moves closer to the bank's long-term goal of two percent.The debate among policymakers during their meetings on Tuesday and Wednesday will likely be whether to lower rates by 25 or 50 basis points. Experts believe that the smaller cut is the more prudent choice.""We expect the Fed to cut by 25bp (basis points),"" economists at Bank of America wrote in a recent note to clients. ""The Fed likes predictability. It's good for markets, good for consumers, good for workers,"" said Modestino from Northeastern.""So a 25 basis point cut now, followed up by another 25 basis point cut in November after the next round of economic data, offers a somewhat smoother glide path for the economy,"" Modestino added.The Federal Reserve is anticipated to implement a series of interest rate reductions in the upcoming meetings, according to economists from various banks. While some, such as those at Goldman Sachs, predict a total cut of 75 basis points spread across the final three meetings of the year, others, like the economists at Citi, have a more aggressive outlook, with their base case involving 125 basis points of easing.Traders also expect a probability exceeding 99 percent to the occurrence of at least four additional rate cuts in 2025. These cuts would result in the Fed's key lending rate falling to a range between 3.5 and 3.75 percent, representing a decrease of 175 basis points from the current levels.This will be the Fed's first rate cut since March 2020, when it drastically reduced rates to near-zero to bolster the US economy during the Covid-19 pandemic.The Fed began increasing rates in 2022 in response to a sharp increase in inflation, primarily caused by post-pandemic supply shortages and the conflict in Ukraine. Since then, it has maintained its key lending rate at a 20-year high of between 5.25 and 5.50 percent for the last 14 months, awaiting improvements in economic conditions.","The Federal Reserve is expected to announce its first interest rate cut in over four years on Wednesday.

A few days ago, in the very final stretch of negotiations on the composition of the future College, you asked France to withdraw my name - for personal reasons that in no instance you have discussed directly with me - and offered, as a political trade-off, an allegedly more influential portfolio for France in the future College. You will now be proposed a different candidate.Over the past five years, I have relentlessly striven to uphold and advance the common European good, above national and party interests.

Majority of US voters support Trump's tariff plans for Chinese imports: Survey,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/majority-of-us-voters-support-trumps-tariff-plans-for-chinese-imports-survey/articleshow/113369193.cms,"A recent Reuters/Ipsos poll reveals that majority of US voters support Donald Trump's pledge to raise tariffs on imported goods, especially those from China, highlighting his economic edge over his competitor, Vice President Kamala Harris The September 11-12 poll indicated that 56% of registered voters were more inclined to back a candidate who supports a new 10% tariff on all imports and a 60% tariff on imports from China, while 41% were less likely to support such a candidate.Both the Republican former president and his Democratic rival have pledged to implement tax cuts if they secure victory in the November 5 election. However, voters also perceive Trump as more likely to reduce the $35 trillion national debt , despite independent economic analysts predicting that his plans would have the contrary effect.The poll also revealed that one-third of Democrats were more likely to support a candidate who favors higher tariffs and steep levies on Chinese goods, while two-thirds were less likely to do so. Independent voters reflected the broader electorate.Polling expert Karlyn Bowman from the conservative American Enterprise Institute attributes Trump's advantage to the perception that the economy performed well during his 2017-2021 administration and his success in persuading voters that US economic issues stemmed from unfair economic competition from other nations, particularly China.Although Harris holds a 5-percentage-point lead over Trump nationally, the US presidential race will be largely determined in approximately seven battleground states where the contest is more competitive.The US economy performed well by many indicators During the Trump administration, until the COVID-19 pandemic devastated the global economy in 2020. Unemployment reached its lowest levels in decades, although the national debt was increasing and would surge during the pandemic.This year, Trump has pledged various tax cuts on the campaign trail, including eliminating income tax on tipped income, a proposal that Harris also supports. On Thursday, he promised to end taxes on overtime pay, with 70% of registered voters supporting the idea of exempting tips from taxes.During his presidency, Donald Trump referred to himself as a ""tariff man"" as he imposed tariffs on imports from China. However, economists, including those at Goldman Sachs, are skeptical of this approach, believing that Trump's policies would hinder economic growth.In the recent presidential debate, Kamala Harris cited Goldman Sachs' evaluation and pointed out that many independent economists think Trump's plans would increase the national debt. Despite this, the poll revealed that 37% of US voters believe Trump is more likely to prioritize debt reduction, while only 30% chose Harris. The remaining 30% believed neither candidate would address the issue.Several respected budget analysts project that Trump's tax proposals would add a minimum of $3 trillion to federal deficits over the next ten years. In contrast, the same analysts predict that Harris' plans would add less than $2 trillion or potentially even reduce the debt. When asked which candidate would prioritize creating a favorable business climate, 47% of polled voters selected Trump, compared to 37% who chose Harris.However, Harris held a slight 1-percentage-point lead (43% to 42%) when voters were asked which candidate would focus on creating ""an economic climate that is good for me and my family."" Voters also believed that Harris was more likely to prioritize making healthcare affordable and investing in infrastructure.Trump had an advantage regarding inflation, which experienced significant increases under Biden's administration in 2021 and 2022. The poll showed that 43% of voters believed Trump would be more likely to ""lower prices for everyday things like groceries and gas,"" while 36% chose Harris.The Reuters/Ipsos poll, which has a margin of error of approximately 3 percentage points, collected online responses from 1,405 registered voters.","A recent Reuters/Ipsos poll reveals that majority of US voters support Donald Trump's pledge to raise tariffs on imported goods, especially those from China.

"Samsung, Xiaomi, 3 others colluding with Amazon, Flipkart: Report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/samsung-xiaomi-3-others-colluding-with-amazon-flipkart-report/articleshow/113357295.cms,"NEW DELHI: Samsung Xiaomi and other smartphone companies colluded with Amazon and Walmart's Flipkart to exclusively launch products on the e-commerce firms' Indian websites in breach of antitrust laws, according to regulatory reports.Antitrust investigations conducted by Competition Commission of India found Amazon and Flipkart violated local competition laws by giving preference to select sellers, prioritising certain listings, and steeply discounting products, hurting other firms.CCI's 1,027-page report on Amazon said that Indian units of five companies - Samsung, Xiaomi, Motorola, Realme and OnePlus - were ""involved in the practice of exclusive"" phone launches in ""collusion"" with Amazon and its affiliates, breaking competition law.In Flipkart's case, a 1,696-page CCI report stated Indian units of Samsung, Xiaomi, Motorola, Vivo and Lenovo conducted similar practices.""Exclusivity in business is anathema. Not only is it against free and fair competition but also against the interest of consumers,"" CCI's additional director general GV Siva Prasad wrote in the Amazon and Flipkart reports, in identical findings.Xiaomi declined to comment, while the other smartphone makers didn't respond to requests for comment. Amazon and Flipkart have not commented on reports' findings .Both reports said that during probe, Amazon & Flipkart ""deliberately downplayed"" allegations of exclusive launches, but officials found the practice was ""rampant"".South Korea's Samsung and China's Xiaomi are two of India's biggest smartphone players, together holding an almost 36% market share. India's e-retail market is set to exceed USD 160 billion by 2028, up from USD 57-60 billion in 2023, consultancy firm Bain estimates.Amazon and Flipkart have long faced the ire of small retailers in India for hurting their offline businesses. CCI reports said both companies used their foreign investments to provide subsidised rates for services like warehousing and marketing to a select number of sellers.Probe into Amazon, Flipkart and their sellers was triggered in 2020 by a complaint from an affiliate of Confederation of All India Traders, which has 8 crore members.CCI will in coming weeks review any objections to its findings from Amazon, Flipkart, the retailer association, and the smartphone companies, and could potentially impose fines along with mandating companies to change their business practices, people familiar with the matter said.Indian retailers have repeatedly accused Amazon and Flipkart, and smartphone companies, of exclusive phone launches online, saying shopkeepers suffered as they didn't get the latest models and customers looked for them on shopping websites.","Antitrust investigations conducted by Competition Commission of India found Amazon and Flipkart violated local competition laws.
