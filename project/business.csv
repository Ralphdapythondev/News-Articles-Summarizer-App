Air India Express flight cancellations: Airline sacks 30 cabin crew; flyers opting for other airlines may have to pay more airfare,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/air-india-express-flight-cancellations-airline-sacks-30-cabin-crew-flyers-opting-for-other-airlines-may-have-to-pay-more-airfare-top-10-things-to-know/articleshow/109974749.cms,"Air India Express Flight Cancellations: 10 Things To Know

Air India Express has terminated the employment of 30 cabin crew members who were part of a group of approximately 300 staff that called in sick simultaneously starting from Tuesday evening. The termination letters issued to the dismissed cabin crew members accuse them of engaging in a premeditated and concerted abstention from work without justifiable reason, leading to the cancellation of numerous flights and causing inconvenience to passengers, reputational damage, and financial losses to the company, states a TOI report. The Tata Group's budget carrier has reduced its daily flights by around 11% until May 13. Due to the shortage of cabin crew, Air India Express cancelled 74 flights on Thursday and announced that Air India would operate services on 20 of its routes to minimize disruptions. Passengers whose flights are cancelled or delayed by more than three hours have the option to request a full refund or reschedule their flight without any additional fees. The number of cancelled flights represents approximately 20% of the airline's scheduled daily flights. The cabin crew of AI Express are protesting against HR issues arising from the impending merger of the former AirAsia India into the airline. The AI Express Employees Union, which the airline management does not recognize as an official union, had written to Tata Group chairman N Chandrasekaran on April 26, 2024, expressing their concerns about the growing unrest and dissatisfaction among the employees, the TOI report says. The situation remains fluid as senior cabin crew members are reporting sick at the last minute, just before they are scheduled to operate flights. While the airline is proactively cancelling flights until next Monday, the actual number of cancellations may vary depending on crew availability. The cancellations by AI Express during the peak summer season are expected to impact travelers, as capacity is already limited due to various factors such as the grounding of over 75 IndiGo planes due to engine issues, the shutdown of GoAir, the reduced operations of struggling SpiceJet, and slower-than-expected deliveries of new aircraft from Airbus and the crisis-ridden Boeing, the TOI report says. Although Air India Express is offering full refunds or complimentary rescheduling, affected passengers may have to purchase last-minute tickets on other airlines at significantly higher spot fares, particularly over the weekend. The aviation ministry has requested the airline to provide a report on the mass cancellations and to promptly resolve the issues. The airline has been advised to ensure that passengers are provided with facilities in accordance with DGCA norms.

Air India Express flights cancellation : Air India Express, the budget carrier of Tata Group , is grappling with ongoing challenges amidst the airline merger process. The airline, which operates between 350 and 400 flights daily, including more than 250 domestic and 120 international routes, has announced a reduction of approximately 40 flights per day until May 13.The situation echoes the recent troubles faced by Vistara, the full-service carrier also undergoing a merger with Air India.Starting Tuesday afternoon, over 300 cabin crew members of AI Express began calling in sick, resulting in the cancellation of more than 90 flights by Wednesday evening. In response, the airline has initiated the issuance of termination letters to the crew members who reported sick. With aircraft occupancy currently exceeding 80%, the cancellations have impacted around 13,000 passengers.",Air India Express has terminated the employment of 30 cabin crew members who were part of a group of approximately 300 staff that called in sick simultaneously starting from Tuesday evening.

Bank employees take note! Supreme Court says interest-free loans given to bank staff taxable as fringe benefits,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/bank-employees-take-note-supreme-court-says-interest-free-loans-given-to-bank-staff-taxable-as-fringe-benefits/articleshow/109964505.cms,"The Supreme Court has dealt a major blow to bank employees by ruling that interest-free or concessional loans provided by banks to their staff will be considered as "" fringe benefits "" or ""amenities,"" and are therefore subject to taxation.According to an ET report by Indu Bhan, the apex court upheld the income tax rule, and said that these benefits enjoyed by bank employees are ""unique"" to them and are in the nature of a 'perquisite,' making them liable for taxation.Section 17(2)(viii) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 and Rule 3(7)(i) of the Income Tax Rules , 1962 were challenged by staff unions and officers' associations of various banks on the grounds of constitutionality. They argued that Rule 3(7)(i) was arbitrary and violated Article 14 of the Constitution by using the prime lending rate of SBI as the benchmark instead of the actual interest rate charged by the bank to a customer on a loan.Justices Sanjiv Khanna and Dipankar Datta, in their judgment, said that ""perquisite"" is a fringe benefit attached to the employee's position, unlike 'profit in lieu of salary,' which is a reward or recompense for past or future service. ""It is incidental to employment and in excess of or in addition to the salary. It is an advantage or benefit given because of employment, which otherwise would not be available,"" the bench said.The Supreme Court has ruled that using the SBI interest rate as the benchmark is not an arbitrary or unequal exercise of power as the rule-making authority has not treated unequal as equals.""By fixing a single clear benchmark for computation of the perquisite or fringe benefit, the rule prevents ascertainment of the interest rates being charged by different banks from the customers and, thus, checks unnecessary litigation,"" it said.The judgment emphasized that SBI, being the largest bank in the country, has a significant impact on the interest rates charged by other banks. “We are of the opinion that the enactment of subordinate legislation for levying tax on interest free/concessional loans as a fringe benefit is within the rulemaking power under Section 17(2)(viii) of the Act,” according to the judgment.Furthermore, the court held that the tax provisions are not unjust, draconian, or harsh on taxpayers. ""A complex problem has been solved through a straitjacket formula, meriting judicial acceptance,"" the bench said, approving the use of SBI's prime lending rate as the benchmark.The top court also noted that laws relating to fiscal or tax measures are granted greater latitude compared to other statutes when it comes to a uniform approach. The bench stated that the legislature should be allowed some flexibility in such matters and that the court would be more inclined to give judicial deference to legislative wisdom.""Commercial and tax legislations tend to be highly sensitive and complex as they deal with multiple problems and are contingent. This court would not like to interfere with the legislation in question, which prevents possibilities of abuse and promotes certainty,"" the bench said.","The Supreme Court has ruled that interest-free loans provided by banks to their staff will be considered as "" fringe benefits "" or ""amenities,"" and are therefore subject to taxation.

Meet the Apple executives who could succeed Tim Cook,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/meet-the-apple-executives-who-could-succeed-tim-cook/articleshow/109964254.cms,"Tim Cook picked up the mantle from Steve Jobs as CEO of Apple over a decade ago and grew it into a multi-trillion dollar company. Now, as Cook nears traditional retirement age, speculation abounds about who will succeed him.Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman joins host David Gura to discuss the challenges of replacing Cook, his potential successors and how that decision will impact one of the best-known brands in the world.Here is a lightly edited transcript of the conversation:David Gura: Every year, the top executives at Apple – of course, one of the largest and most influential companies in the world – are whisked away to an idyllic retreat usually in Carmel Valley.That’s about 90 miles south of the company’s headquarters, in Cupertino, California. So, many of these execs travel by bus.Mark Gurman: They can't bring their family, they can't bring their assistants. These are the 100 most important people at Apple.Gura: Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman has covered Apple for almost 15 years, and he says this annual meeting is one of the most important dates on the company’s calendar.It’s something Steve Jobs started.Gurman: They sit in auditoriums, different rooms of this beautiful resort in Northern California. They are taught and shown all of the goodness that's to come from Apple in the years to come.Gura: It was at this retreat that Apple’s so-called “Top 100” got a first look at the original iPad, Mark says.They saw the MacBook Air and the Apple Watch. And got updates on the Apple Car project, which the company just scrapped.Gurman: This is where you go to learn about Apple's future.Gura: And while most of the focus is on product presentations – and prototypes, Apple’s senior leaders are also taking note of who among them has been picked to make these presentations.Gurman: I think the people at that event are probably always naturally trying to figure out who's next in line. Who's in charge?Gura: That is … who will eventually replace Tim Cook.Jobs’ hand-picked successor has been the CEO of Apple for nearly thirteen years. He was Jobs’ deputy before that.Gura: At Apple, succession planning is the elephant in the room, and even though Cook hasn’t indicated he plans to leave the company anytime soon, Mark says there is growing speculation about when that’ll happen who will be its next chief executive – and whether that person is in this group of Apple’s most important people.Gurman: We’re nearing sort of the end of Cook’s tenure at Apple, probably, right? He's going to turn 65 next year. He's older than most CEOs in the S&P 500. He's been at Apple for 25 years and Apple's at a precarious position because the executive team where they likely would choose their next CEO from most of the people on that executive team are all about 60 years old, or would probably be in their mid to late sixties by the time Tim Cook retires, leaving the company with very few reasonable options.Gura: Today on the show:The challenges of finding someone who could do one of the most demanding jobs in business.Who’s in the running, and how that decision will impact a $2.8 trillion company, and one of the best-known brands in the world.I’m David Gura, and this is The Big Take, from Bloomberg News.Gura: Tim Cook has been the CEO of Apple for more than a decade.And part of his job involves planning for who will succeed him. Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman says it's not the easiest job to fill.Gura: Is that job description really well fleshed out? In other words, what does an Apple CEO need to be able to do?Gurman: An Apple CEO needs to either be the visionary to bring new products to market. Or needs to be able to find who the visionary is and partner with that visionary to bring those new products to market.Gura: It’s a challenge that wasn’t lost on Steve Jobs when he tapped Cook for the job.Gurman: You know, the thing about Cook is that it is all consuming, and I think one of the reasons that Jobs made him the CEO, other than the fact that he was the most qualified, probably by a long shot, amongst the executive team at the time, is that Jobs knew how all consuming the next era of Apple would be, right?And Tim's entire life for the most part, based on everyone who knows him and everyone you speak to about him is Apple.Gura: Cook became Apple’s CEO in 2011, under intense scrutiny.He took over for Jobs, the company’s founder, who was battling pancreatic cancer.And in October of that year, Cook stepped into the spotlight, to unveil a new version of the iPhone :Tim Cook: Good morning. This is my first product launch since being named CEO. I'm sure you didn't know that.Gura: You can hear him cracking a joke to acknowledge what a big moment this was. He was under immense pressure – following in Jobs’ footsteps.Cook: I Love Apple. And I consider it the privilege of a lifetime to have worked here for almost 14 years.Gura: As Apple’s chief operating officer, Cook worked side-by-side with Jobs, during a period when Apple grew at breakneck speed. When it became much more than a computer company.Cook: Just ten years ago, we launched the original iPod here, and it went on to revolutionize the way we listen to music.Gura: Mark, you covered that transition in 2011. What can you tell us about the relationship between Steve Jobs and Tim Cook?Gurman: They were close. I wouldn't say that they were best friends. Uh, I would say in many ways they were, uh, partners. Steve Jobs was the design mind. He was the person dreaming up these new products, and Tim Cook was the execution guy. He was the person for all intents and purposes, who was able to bring these products to market, get them manufactured, get them into retail stores, and so forth. And then when Steve Jobs stepped down and then ultimately passed away, what Apple lost was sort of that visionary to dream up new types of product categories, new designs, new user experiencesGura: Jobs died on October 5th, 2011 – one day after Cook unveiled that new iPhone.And in the years that followed, Cook made sure Apple continued to build on the runaway success of that device.Gurman: The Apple watch for all intents and purposes is an accessory or an extension of the iPhone. Airpods are an extension to the iPhone, an accessory to the iPhone. What Tim Cook has done, he's taken the product lines that Steve Jobs created and envisioned, and supercharged them. When Steve Jobs passed, there was only one iPad model, the iPad 2.Today, there are five, or even more iPad models available right now. The iPhone went from one or two different models to several different models. So what Tim Cook has been able to do is squeeze so much juice out of the lemons that are those original Apple form factors.Gura: Under his leadership, Apple added products and services, along with new accessories.The company branched into movies and TV.It introduced an Apple credit card.Gurman: At its core, I think Apple is still very much a technology company, but they like to position themselves as well as a lifestyle company.Gura: Now, more than a decade into his tenure, do you see this company as Tim Cook's Apple, or is it still Steve Jobs’ Apple that, that Tim Cook is the steward of?Gurman: I think it's actually a mix of both. At its very core, Steve Jobs left Apple with something, you know, more than pretty good in the iPhone. And Tim Cook, I would say, has probably made the most of what he was left with. I don't think anyone could have done a better job following in the footsteps as legendary as someone like Steve Jobs.Gura: People worried Steve Jobs would be irreplaceable, but now, there’s a sense Tim Cook’s shoes will be hard to fill.Gurman: So The question is Apple moving forward, who was that new person to lead Apple into a new era with a new vision, with new types of products. And that's really what Apple needs to come up with to create its next 15 years.Gura: There are a handful of names that come up in conversations about CEO succession at Apple.But over the years, as Mark has reported on this, there’s been a clear frontrunner.Gurman: He can own the stage. He can talk the talk with government officials from China to Europe to the US. If something happened unexpectedly to Cook, I don't think Apple would miss a beat.Gura: So, who is Apple’s heir apparent? And who else is waiting in the wings, vying for the top job? That’s after the break.Gura: Before Tim Cook became Apple’s CEO, he was the chief operating officer under Steve Jobs.And when it comes to who will replace Cook, his current COO could easily be next in line:Cook: And to tell us about some progress in this area, I'd like to invite up Jeff Williams. Jeff?Gura: That’s Cook introducing Jeff Williams at a product launch in 2016:Williams: Last year, we introduced Research Kit. And our goal was to use technology to solve some of the biggest problemsGura: Williams has been C-O-O for almost a decade now. He joined the company in 1998.Gurman: Right now, he runs Apple's entire operations. He's in charge of the Apple supply chain.He's in charge of Apple's health care efforts. He's in charge of Apple watch hardware and software engineering. He was in charge of the Apple car. He's involved with the Apple vision pro headset, and he's in charge of Apple's hardware and software design organization. So he has so much in his portfolio already, and he would be able to be a shoo-in pretty easily for Cook if something were to happen.A lot of people have called him Tim Cook's Tim Cook.Gura: And like Cook, Williams grew up in the South, he got an MBA from Duke, and had a stint at IBM before joining Apple.But there’s something else these two have in common. They’re both in their early sixties.Gurman: He’s only two years younger than Cook.Gura: And that could make William’s path to succeeding Cook complicated.Gurman: If Cook retires in three to five years, you can't name a 66 year old Jeff Williams as CEO of Apple. Right? The Street, the market, the employees, the board, probably wouldn't be terribly fond of that idea. You can't set up someone for a two to five year tenure as a new CEO of a company as big and as important as Apple.Gura: This is not just an issue with Williams, though.When you go down the list of other potential candidates among Apple’s top management, a trend emerges.Mark says many members of the company’s leadership team are also hovering around retirement age.And turnover at the executive level is pretty rare.Gurman: When you're a Senior Vice President at Apple, you're essentially the CEO of a major division, right? You're at one of the most successful companies in the world. You're also getting paid $25 million per year as an Apple Senior Vice President. So from a financial standpoint, it's very worthwhile to stay around. But I think the people in Apple's executive team, they're motivated by more than money. I think there's a sense that a lot of these folks are very much motivated by the power that comes with being in that role. And so power is sometimes hard to give up.Gura: Mark says, if it’s not Williams, there are a few other candidates who are likely in the running.They’re all currently on the Apple payroll. Tim Cook himself has said he hopes the board taps someone from within the company. And they have their own trade-offs.Finding a single person who can do everything that an Apple CEO needs to do is a real challenge.One potential candidate is on his second stint at Apple:Gurman: Craig Federighi, who's in charge of software engineering.Gura: But, Mark says?Gurman: Federighi probably doesn't have the business acumen to run the whole company.Gura: There’s also Deirdre O'Brien, who oversees Apple’s sprawling retail operation worldwide.Gurman: And before that, Uh, she was one of the company's top executives on operations and sales.Gura: But according to Mark? ...Gurman: Apple probably wants to try something new for a new era and not go with another operations or an HR person.Gura: But Mark has identified another candidate. Who, with his age and experience, is a strong contender.Gurman: Everything that I have learned while reporting the story points to a guy named John Ternus.He is not even 50 years old. He's Apple's senior vice president of Hardware Engineering.He joined Apple's executive team in 2021. He has quickly risen through the ranks. He used to be a VP in charge of Mac computer engineering. He eventually added the iPad, added AirPods. More recently, he added the iPhone and the Apple watch. And now he's in charge of basically all of the money making hardware for Apple.And he's become an increasingly important face at the company. He's been increasingly promoted in their marketing. He's dealing with regulators in terms of right to repair laws. So he's becoming a bigger part of the Apple story.Gura: Mark says Ternus had a marquee role this year, at that annual executive conference in Northern California.And just this week, Apple unveiled some new tech, and Cook called on Ternus at that event to introduce those new products to the public.Tim Cook: So here's John to tell you more. …John Ternus: Let's kick things off with iPad Air.Gura: Mark says Ternus’ prospects of becoming Apple’s next CEO get better the longer Cook sticks around.And there is no indication he plans to retire anytime soon.Executives are not under the same pressure they used to be, to retire in their mid-Sixties.Gura: Mark, I wonder if you could situate this conversation in kind of a broader cultural sea change we're seeing. Bob Iger back at Disney in his 70s. That must in some way sort of liberate Tim Cook to look perhaps at a longer tenure at Apple.Gurman: Yeah, that's a very good point. Certainly the next U. S. president is going to be in their 80s during their tenure. You have Pat Gelsinger, who's the CEO of Intel. He was named to that role three years ago when he was about 60. So certainly you do have some older statesmen there with Tim Cook, you know, one of the, the, the older ones and Apple appreciates, as some people tell me, the people with gray hair there, that means they have experience and wisdom, and they've been around the block a few times. There is nothing that Tim Cook hasn't seen, and wisdom goes a long way for being an Apple executive.Gura: For his part, Cook has a lot of unfinished business he’s attending to right now:Apple’s seen a slowdown in sales, the company is taking hits from regulators – in the US and the European Union, and after Apple’s adventure in automobile manufacturing came to a screeching halt, it’s under pressure to deliver something new.All of that, and more, is on Cook’s plate, and Mark says no one is pushing him to step aside.Gurman: There's no mandatory retirement age. And I would say that even if there was, uh, they'd rip that up or shred it or light it on fire to let Cook stay around as long as he wants to. Because he's been effective, Wall Street loves him. The stock price has surely been positively reflected by Cook's tenure.And so I think Tim Cook is going to be the CEO of Apple as long as he wants to be the CEO of Apple and he won't step down a day before that.",Tim Cook has been the CEO of Apple for more than a decade. Part of his job involves planning for who will succeed him. Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman says it's not the easiest job to fill.

Tata Sons doubles royalty fee to Rs 200 crore,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tata-sons-doubles-royalty-fee-to-rs-200-crore/articleshow/109989929.cms,"MUMBAI: Tata Sons , owner of the Tata brand, has doubled the royalty fee - paid by its operating companies - to Rs 200 crore. Companies like TCS , Tata Steel and Tata Motors pay the royalty fee for using the Tata name.Tata Sons has doubled the fee five years after fixing it at Rs 100 crore. Simultaneously, the holding company of Tata Group is ramping up its brand-building exercise through the title sponsorship of IPL, among other initiatives.TCS, in its notice to shareholders, revealed that it made a royalty payout of Rs 200 crore to Tata Sons in FY24.Tata Sons chairman emeritus Ratan Tata had introduced the brand subscription scheme in 1996 that required a group company, using the Tata name directly, to shell out 0.25% of its annual revenue or 5% of its pre-tax profit, whichever was lower, whereas a group entity, using the Tata name indirectly, has to pay 0.15% of its annual revenue.In 2015, Tata Sons, then led by the late Cyrus Mistry, capped the maximum brand subscription fee at Rs 75 crore. This was subsequently increased by 33% by current chairman N Chandrasekaran. For fiscal years 2023 and 2022, TCS shelled out Rs 100 crore each to Tata Sons.A source said besides revising the upper limit to Rs 200 crore, Tata Sons has done away with the fee based on a company's pre-tax profit. In other words, an operating entity has to pay 0.25% of its annual revenue, with the maximum fee now set at Rs 200 crore.Brand subscription fee is one of the revenue streams of Tata Sons. In FY23, it earned Rs 1,008 crore as brand subscription income.This kitty has swollen over the years as fortunes of operating companies changed drastically with multi-billion-dollar businesses built through acquisitions and expansions. Tata Sons' FY23 brand subscription income saw a jump of 23% from Rs 820 crore in FY22. The holding company uses the brand subscription fund to promote and protect the Tata brand, which is worth $29 billion (about Rs 2.4 lakh crore), according to international consultancy firm Brand Finance.","Tata Sons has doubled the fee five years after fixing it at Rs 100 crore.

The firm estimates its emerging-market bond gauge currently has $216 billion of assets under management, she added.“We have seen in the past that assets tracking the index are relatively sticky in nature and generally remain consistent,” Kim said.Indian sovereign bonds have seen about $8 billion of inflows into the so-called Fully Accessible Route securities since the JPMorgan announcement, though there were some outflows in April amid a global debt selloff. A Bloomberg gauge of the bonds has outperformed major peers this year.The inflows from the long-anticipated index inclusion are leaving their mark on a variety of Indian assets, with corporate bonds also besting peers and foreign exchange reserves hitting a record high. They have played a role in helping the rupee shrug off the impact of a broad strengthening in the dollar.Bloomberg Index Services Ltd will also start including India to its emerging markets index from January. Bloomberg LP is the parent company of Bloomberg Index Services, which administers indexes that compete with those from other providers.Indian government authorities have made substantial market reforms for investors, according to JPMorgan.These include extending the trade-matching window for foreign portfolio investors and streamlining the onboarding process through the introduction of a single application form, Kim said. The registration process was also simplified by accepting digital signatures and scanned copies for account registration, she said.There are also several India-dedicated bond exchange-traded funds and UCITS funds offering intraday liquidity to investors, Kim said.“These steps have improved the overall market accessibility and tradability for FPIs, making investors more comfortable with investing in the Indian government bond market,” she said.","JPMorgan Chase & Co is on track to include India in its emerging market debt index from June.

The finance minister set the stage for a ""Viksit Bharat by 2047"", on the core principles of ‘Sabka Saath’, ‘Sabka Vikas’, ‘Sabka Vishwas’, with ‘Sabka Prayas’ being added as a new theme in the interim Budget.This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data i.e., farmer welfare and N for Nari utthan i.e., support for women entrepreneurs.These form the pillars of a comprehensive inclusive development. The Government's commitment to sustainable development under the strategy for Amrit Kaal includes achieving 'Net Zero' by 2070, rooftop solarization for one crore households and robust health initiatives.The Indian economy's resilience takes center stage amidst positive indicators of declining current account deficit as a percentage of GDP, falling unemployment rates, and a notable rise in digital transactions. These statistics affirm the robustness of the economy, showcasing a trajectory of growth and stability.The achievements in taxation reforms are nothing short of remarkable, with direct tax collections more than trebling in the last decade, the number of tax return filers increasing by 2.4 times, average processing time of tax returns plummeting from 93 days in FY 2013-14 to an impressive 10 days in FY 2023-24, resulting in issuance of quick refunds. These are the results of consistent progressive measures thus obviating the need for, and rightly avoiding, any last-minute populist measures.No change in existing tax rates, both for direct and indirect taxes, is a good indicator of stability and predictability for investors and taxpayers.A welcome move to waive outstanding tax demands that are minor, disputed, and unreconciled. This involves the withdrawal of outstanding direct tax demands up to Rs. 25,000 pertaining to the period up to FY 2009-10 and up to Rs.10,000 for FY 2010-11 to 2014-15.The Government's commitment to fostering a business-friendly environment is evident in its intent to extend specific tax benefits for start-ups, investments by sovereign wealth funds/ pension funds, and certain IFSC units. The extension has been made now until March 31, 2025. This might help in creating a conducive landscape for business.To align with the CBDT notification issued earlier, the provisions relating to tax collection at source concerning remittances under the Liberalized Remittance Scheme have now been formally incorporated in the Finance Bill, 2024, setting the rate at 20% for amounts exceeding Rs. 7 lakhs in a financial year.The Finance Bill, 2024 proposes an extension of the time limit for introducing the faceless scheme by the Central Government for transfer pricing proceedings, DRP Proceedings, and ITAT Proceedings, up to March 31, 2025.The interim Budget 2024 may not have proposed significant tax announcements, but it very well positioned the prelude to the full budget post the upcoming elections. Considering the potential impact on the population across the four pillars of GYAN, a sizable portion of India stands to be covered. The interim Budget’s focus on the tax front resembles a report card, highlighting the maturity achieved by our tax system. The enhancement of taxpayer services was emphasized as a key priority.","This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data and N for Nari utthan.

Interim Budget for a Viksit Bharat: It’s for everyone and all,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/interim-budget-for-a-viksit-bharat-its-for-everyone-and-all/articleshow/107497439.cms,"By Akhilesh Tuteja

The Finance Minister on February 01, 2024, delivered a truly innovative interim budget. At first glance, it did not seem like an interim budget but looked more like the budget to drive further growth and a continuum of inclusive growth-oriented investments.At the outset, this budget brings a wonderful balance between fiscal prudence and continued investment for growth.It's not easy to continue the glide path of reducing the fiscal deficit and continuing to make significant investments in all areas including infrastructure, R&D, energy transition, technology, skilling, and social welfare. The surprising reduction in fiscal deficit of 5.8% as against the budgeted 5.9% for FY24 and the projection of 5.1% in FY25 with a clear focus on increasing investments was a huge positive.This was a budget for everyone and all because it caters to every part of the Indian economy and society. The FM has carefully catered to the investment needs of various sectors. The continued focus on youth, impoverished, women and farmers to increase their involvement and contribution to economic growth is evident. By committing an 11.1% increase in capital expenditure to 11,11,111 lakh crore, the FM has clearly brought every single 1 in this growth journey.What was very impressive was the inclusion strategy of the government. The focus on women's empowerment for the past few years is unprecedented, which is reflected in the inclusion of women in the workforce moving from 23.3% to 37% in the last five years. The thirty crore Mudra Yojna loans to women entrepreneurs were a great boost to the Nari Shakti initiative. We already have over 10 million Lakhpati Didis and what is truly evident is like a corporate CFO, the FM has revised the earlier target of 20 million Lakhpati Didis to 30 million. The government also plans to invest in initiatives to encourage young girls between the ages of 9 and 14 to undertake the vaccination for cervical cancer which is again a great boost to Nari Shakti.A lot needs to be done to bring more women into all parts of economic growth but the journey so far and the vision of the future is truly inspiring.While India continues on its technological prowess and makes its mark in new technologies like Artificial Intelligence, we need a multi-pronged strategy to harness the power of AI. We need a clear focus on building AI systems in India so that we not only emerge as a global leader in this new era but can build models, which are specific to India that will benefit Indians. At the same time, we need a very wide coverage program to build skills to leverage AI to its fullest potential. The biggest contribution we can make to the inclusion of youth in the economic development of the country is by skilling them in new skill areas. In the last few years, the Skill India Mission has trained 14 million youth, reskilled over 5 million youth and established a staggering 3,000 new ITIs. The future of any country will depend as much on capital investments as on skill investments.The focus on agricultural development and support to the farmer continues through direct financial assistance to farmers. The farmers have benefited by getting crop insurance through PM Fasal Bima Yojana. It's not just the farmers, the PM-SVANidhi provides credit assistance to a large number of street vendors.The last few years have seen the journey of affordable housing through Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY). There is a slight increase in allocation to launch a scheme for encouraging the middle class to build or buy new homes. This investment will likely propel a wider economic development and increase employment.India has seen a tremendous rise in entrepreneurship in the last few years. In order to continue the journey and promote new startups, the government proposes to extend certain tax benefits, which are expiring from March 2024 to March 2025. The MSMEs have not been left behind. With a proposal to provide timely finances to such enterprises, the government has paved the way for their growth, so they can look to compete globally.All in all, it’s a truly inclusive budget with a clear focus on development not just by giving away freebies but enabling the people to participate in the economic development activity. While the FM calls the comprehensive GDP - Governance, Development & Performance – to me, this budget is inclusive of another GDP – gender, demography, and professions.","Akhilesh Tuteja is Partner and Head, Clients and Markets, KPMG in India.

‘Enough domestic sources of demand to counter drag from external sector’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/enough-domestic-sources-of-demand-to-counter-drag-from-external-sector/articleshow/107372012.cms,"Do you think the

creates room for lower interest rates?

One of the issues that the Budget has flagged is the demographic challenge and opportunity and the societal change that is taking place. How do you view this?

Niti Aayog is working on the Viksit Bharat roadmap. What will be the focus areas?

You are as much a representative of the Centre as well as the states. Is it time to revisit the entire formula for transfers to states particularly on the issue of cesses and surcharges?

Suman Bery , who heads Niti Aayog , the govt think tank, is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China, which he says is also an opportunity for India. The economist is confident that Indian states remain resilient. Excerpts of the interview with TOI.The finance ministry expects the economy to grow 7% next year.Given the global situation, how do you see the prospects?The belief in the finance ministry is that we have a possible drag coming from the external sector but that we have other sources. We have enough domestic sources of demand. One has to applaud the political and economic judgment of FM in deciding that it was appropriate to pursue the path of fiscal consolidation. There is transparency. What this actually reflects is responsible economic management, which is one reason we are where we are. Second, it also creates a buffer so that there is policy space if we do encounter headwinds.That’s the hope and expectation. We have an independent central bank and an inflation targeting central bank, so it is up to the monetary policy committee to take a call through the monetary policy committee on the repo rate .The PM has said that when India grows its states grow. India is a composite of 37 states and UTs. They are each at very different points in their demographic transition. There are some states where the net replacement rate is down to 1%, like Kerala . There are others, particularly UP and Bihar, which are in their earliest stage of demographic transition and each one of these states is the size of a large European country. There are two implications of that — one is internal labour mobility and it will become an even larger part of our growth model. The govt has taken several steps to create a unified market. Our main endowment is our human capital and that has to be equipped to participate in global exchange in many ways. We know from China, Japan that the demographic dividend partly depends on markets and on human capital. But the golden period is fairly short lived, about 15 years, when the so called dependency ratio declines. The other big opportunity the PM has been highlighting is bringing women much more into the active labour force.When Niti was set up there was the idea of a three-year vision and a seven-year strategy paper. The reality is that schemes of govt tend to be aligned with the award of the Finance Commission . There are various established building blocks or hand holds which are already a matter of govt policy. The PM is much more interested in a national debate on what it means to be a Viksit Bharat or modern society. We have a collective goal and it is for the democratic polity to define what that goal should be. Its emphatically not for a super mandarin bureaucracy. It is not going to be Lee Kwan Yew’s Singapore led from the top.It’s entirely a finance ministry matter but I would be lying if I didn’t say when I visit certain states there is this complaint. A big frontier would be resource mobilisation at the state level. Second is going to be rationalisation of subsidies not only at the Union level, but also at the state level. All chief ministers sit on my governing council. When they convene as the governing council, I see them in their role as development practitioners. The world is beginning to appreciate quite how much institutional and political maturity India attained in our 75 years and the most fundamental dimension of a democracy, we have orderly transfers of power. There are enough buffers to ensure that what happens in state finances is unlikely to create macro instability. Those risks are well contained by our Constitution. The chief ministers know that they are going to be judged by development outcomes and so you can have the sugar rush of changing of pension plans or various handouts but if the cupboard is bare you are not going to be able to deliver.","Suman Bery is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China.

Government's Marathon to 2047: Emphasis on Fiscal Prudence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/governments-marathon-to-2047-emphasis-on-fiscal-prudence/articleshow/107371788.cms,"What was the thinking behind keeping the vote on account absolutely straight?

So is it the idea to keep the Budget completely transparent?

The capex has risen 11.1% and there is an emphasis on infrastructure spending. But there is also the hope that the private sector will now take over and start capital spending. Given the geopolitical situation, how confident is the govt that it will pan out as planned?

Finance secretary T V Somanathan, in an interview with TOI, says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047 . Excerpts:If you see the Budget speech you will see the emphasis on 2047. The govt has set its sight on running that marathon.Running to 2047 is a marathon , it’s not a sprint. If you are going to run a marathon, you need to be in good shape and you can’t have short-term stimulants or something that will get you some yards and then it’s done.The whole focus is on making India a developed country by 2047, for which a healthy present and a strong fiscal position is an important concomitant. Some purely short term measures don’t really fit into that picture. It’s a consistent picture: focus on the long term for which you need to build strength in the short term and that needs to be done by prudence in fiscal policy and by not doing things which can detract you from that path. Not doing the wrong thing is more important than appearing to do things.The idea is that govt finances may be good, bad or indifferent depending on the times, depending on the circumstances, depending on the policies. But what is the position should be reflected as reasonably and accurately as possible. That is an emphasis. As regards the Finance Commission, again the terms of reference that have been given to them are the terms in the Constitution.What is the means by which the devolution should be done is a matter they have full discretion. They can actually take all kinds of factors into account and in a sense we felt this time based on my review of the previous commissions that the right expression would be less is more. The shorter, less prescriptive terms of reference gives full scope for all stakeholders including state govts to express their viewpoints and for the commission to take a balanced view of the different perspectives and then come to its award. Ultimately the award of the Finance Commission is about devolution and grant for which full scope has now been given to them.n There are incipient signs of private capital expenditure accelerating. There are some surveys I have seen done by some of the chambers industry, which show high levels of investment. The PMI, which is a sort of leading indicator, is also looking pretty healthy. Capacity utilisation is one reason that private sector capital expenditure doesn’t immediately pick up when the economy starts accelerating because there is surplus capacity.But increasingly I get the sense that many industries are beginning to reach levels where they have to add capacity. When that happens capital investment will happen. Another pointer also mentioned in the Budget speech you may notice that our airlines have placed large orders for planes — that is capital expenditure.When you import 1,000 aircraft, it’s just not 1,000 aircraft, there are concomitant additions to ground handling facilities, you need airports to expand, you need to employ people to do that. That means a lot of jobs. The aircraft is capital but then look at the effect it is going to have on skilled jobs. So capital expenditure is happening. I am fairly confident that we will have decent capital expenditure in the year to come and that will become a new source of acceleration.",Finance secretary T V Somanathan says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047.

What is the Section 80C limit for tax deduction for FY 2024-25 after Interim Budget 2024?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/income-tax-budget-2024-2024-2025-section-80c-limit-epf-ppf-elss-nsc/articleshow/107353021.cms,"ALSO READ |

Income Tax Changes Budget 2024 : In the recent Budget 2024 speech, the Finance Minister kept the Section 80C tax deduction limit unchanged. The maximum limit for claiming tax benefits under Section 80C remains at Rs 1.5 lakh for the current fiscal year 2023-24 and will stay the same for individuals looking to save on taxes through Section 80C investments in the upcoming fiscal year 2024-25.Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions. Individuals can reduce their gross taxable income by up to Rs 1.5 lakh per financial year by engaging in these specific investments or expenditures.You can save on taxes through Section 80C by investing in things like Employees' Provident Fund (EPF), Public Provident Fund (PPF), Equity Linked Saving Scheme (ELSS) mutual funds, National Savings Certificate (NSC), and 5-year tax-saving fixed deposits with banks or post offices. Additionally, paying life insurance policy premiums also qualifies for tax benefits under Section 80C.It is important to note that each eligible investment comes with its specific maximum limit, rate of return, liquidity, and taxation rules for the earned returns, states ET in a report. For instance, the most you can invest in PPF in a financial year is Rs 1.5 lakh. Meanwhile, there's no limit on the amount you can invest in ELSS mutual funds, but the Section 80C deduction is capped at Rs 1.5 lakh.If individuals can't make specific investments, they can still get deductions under Section 80C from their gross taxable income through certain expenses. These expenses include repaying the principal amount of a home loan, tuition fees for children, payment of stamp duty, registration fees, and other costs related to buying a house.Since the financial year 2020-21, individuals without any business income must annually choose between the old and new tax regimes. As of the fiscal year 2023-24, the new tax regime is the default option. Consequently, individuals seeking tax deductions under Section 80C must opt for the old tax regime since this deduction isn't available in the new tax regime. It's crucial for taxpayers to be aware of these rules to make informed decisions about their tax planning and investment strategies.","Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget which is an interim budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year. The budget talks about inclusive development both, social and geographical, especially for youth, women, farmers, and the poor. Continued focus on improving logistics through infrastructure spend on roads, rail, airports, ports increases productivity for companies and citizens alike.To make ‘Viksit Bharat’ by 2047, the government’s focus is on improving and empowering people’s capabilities through various skilling initiatives. It is encouraging to see that Skill India Mission has succeeded in training more than 1.4 crore youth and upskilling and reskilling 54 lakh youth. I am particularly happy to see the continued focus on youth and women entrepreneurship and the announcement of a new fund which will give interest free 50 year loans for startups will provide a domestic fillip to startups supplementing venture capital we have traditionally relied on from abroad.PM Mudra Yojana has sanctioned 43 crore loans aggregating to 22.5 lakh crore to youth entrepreneurs and thirty crore Mudra Yojana loans to women entrepreneurs. There are several other schemes like Fund of Funds, Start-Up India, and Start-Up Credit Guarantee schemes that are assisting our youth. Further, the extension of tax benefits to Start-ups and investments made by sovereign wealth funds/pension funds, till 31st March 2025 depicts the government’s effort to support the startup eco- system.This aligns quite well with India Sanitation Coalition’s efforts to give impetus to the start-up world. Over the past 7 editions of our ISC-FICCI Sanitation Awards, we have recognized and promoted several start-ups in the sanitation space, many of whom are successful businesses now!While the finance minister did not provide detailed information on Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH), the budget allocation sees a slight increase in spend demonstrating continued focus on this highly successful program. The acknowledgement that the private sector has increasingly played a substantial role in addressing WASH issues in both urban and rural areas, with numerous projects underway through Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs), highlights the government's commitment to addressing challenges in this sector.A perfect example is the LightHouse Initiative initiated by the Department of Drinking Water along with the India Sanitation Coalition (ISC) by partnering with major corporates across India to develop model villages in Solid and Liquid Waste Management (SLWM) under SBM-Grameen. From this budget, there is an expectation that the government will persist in prioritizing Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) as the path toward achieving the country's Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6). Additionally, it is hoped that the government will uphold its commitment to making necessary infrastructural investments for SLWM.The budget speech rightly celebrates the fact that we have 83 lakh SHGs and 9 crore women beneficiaries. The microfinance movement in the country and the possibility of empowering women members of SHGs through livelihood skilling is a key to bringing women into mainstream economic advancement.The focus on green growth, rooftop solar, wind, biomass, e-vehicles all help with our green energy thrust. The tourism sector was mentioned and could be a huge job provider for youth and women.Guided by the principle ‘Reform, Perform, and Transform’, the budget emphasizes efficient implementation of various policies by improving coordination with states and relevant stakeholders. This is critical both for infra spend and social programsIt is noteworthy that ISC’s Climate Resilient Coastal Cities project which is being implemented in PPP (Public-Private Partnership) mode in four coastal states of Karnataka, Gujarat, Goa and Maharashtra is congruent with the government’s priority of promoting climate-resilient activities for the blue economy 2.0, a scheme for restoration and adaptation measures, and coastal aquaculture.The budget also focuses on the Aspirational districts program where assistance will be given to the states for faster development of aspirational districts and blocks, including the generation of ample economic opportunities. This is again very crucial as it has a huge potential to transform the landscape of our country while making sure no -one is left behind.Overall, this budget has embraced economic strategies and develops the building blocks that nurture and uphold growth, promote inclusive and sustainable development, and enhance productivity.","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year.

There is no such thing as doing it all alone.Whether it is at home or at the office, support systems are what any mother needs to thrive. That’s what techie moms told us for this Mother’s Day edition of Times Techies. Return to work programmes are also frequently cited as a valuable initiative that acknowledges the difficulties of giving birth, raising children, and then getting back to a competitive work environment.Leverage AI tools to save timeRuchi Bhasin | Director, AI, ML & Analytics, Harman digital transformation solutionsTech roles require constant learning and upskilling – balancing my learning with my child’s education has been a challenge. To better help him learn, I am learning Kannada myself and with time I’ve realised that I have learnt a language which is not a coding language and which is also helpful in daily life! It has changed both my and my child’s perspective – when he sees me working on my Python “language” skills just like he is learning Kannada he wants to learn coding too, and we do have fun doing some simple and fun codes together. Tech roles at Harman allow us flexible timings and provide a culture of community which we can leverage whenever we need support. I also leverage AI tools (like Copilot, Open AI) to help with research which saves me a lot of time! My advice to young mothers – both career andmotherhood are rewarding and beautiful experiences and neither need to come at the price of the other. Never forget taking care of yourself – get some self-care time and don’t strive for perfectionism.Motherhood is just one part of who we areMousumi Chatterjee | Senior director, content experience, Salesforce IndiaAs a working professional, balancing motherhood and a tech career is not an easy job, but I’ve learned that it can be achieved by maintaining a disciplined life and embracing vulnerability. As a working mom of two, I’ve ensured that my sons understand that motherhood is just one part of who I am. My dedication extends to all aspects of my life, including being a passionate techie. One of the challenges I faced was the multiple health issues during pregnancy which made it difficult for me to get back to work. However, the unwavering support of my family, especially my husband, and from my employers, allowed me to follow my passion. Another classic example of maintaining a career as a mother is when I was offered a leadership position in Hyderabad. Despite residing in Bengaluru at the time, my husband wholeheartedly supported the decision, recognising my passion for work at Salesforce and my desire to make an impact as a woman leader. So as a working mom, my advice to young women in tech is to plan ahead of time, share responsibilities with your family, and communicate your needs clearly at work and home.Compassion, curiosity, and creativity are all you needNithya Raman | Client technology sap quality lead, EY GDSTwo decades ago, I was tech averse. Today, I lead the quality service for tech teams at EY GDS, a transformation mirrored by my journey into motherhood 14 years ago. As a tech leader and mother, I balance the demanding pace of my career with the nurturing role at home, a journey made richer by the 3Cs — Compassion, Curiosity, and Creativity. Compassion is my anchor, allowing me to empathize with my team during evolving challenges and to be there for my 13-year-old son. This emotional intelligence has made me a better leader and a more attentive mother. Curiosity fuels my continuous learning in the dynamic tech field and in understanding my son’s perspective. It’s about asking the right questions and maintaining a growth mindset, which enhances my professional growth and encourages my son’s explorative spirit. A child’s natural inquisitiveness rekindles our own, preventing us from sinking into the monotony of routine. Creativity is the spark for innovation in my work and for problemsolving in parenting. Thinking outside the box is essential for the success of my team and the wellbeing of my family.Utilise return-to-work initiativesUma Maheswari Palanichamy | Lead quality engineer, QA Management, EpsilonWorking mothers face a unique set of challenges when it comes to balancing their careers and motherhood. While both roles are rewarding, they can also be demanding and overwhelming at times. It’s a delicate balance that requires patience, planning, and self-compassion. After 12 years of working, I had to take a career break to address my child’s learning difficulties, but I was lucky to get back to the industry thanks to the ‘She Rises’ program Epsilon offers for women to confidently re-enter the workforce and pursue their career goals. Currently, my son is preparing for his boards. Women need to remember that it’s okay to prioritise their family when needed and that there are resources available to help them continue advancing in their careers. Over the years, the industry has also progressed, and today there are various policies and initiatives around rejoining the workforce, upskilling, and child support that women should utilise to thrive both personally and professionally. My advice to young women who are looking at motherhood would be to surround themselves with a supportive network, have open communication with their employer, and most importantly, don’t compare yourself with others.SLOWING DOWN AT WORK IS FINEMeghana Mayya | Senior director, technology, Lowe’s IndiaBalancing motherhood and a career in technology, especially as a leader, is complex to say the least; let alone with twin boys! The challenges are constant – the pressure to excel in both roles, the constant prioritisation of responsibilities, and very importantly, a personal bucket list of items that keep whispering at the back of your mind. With the constant support of my family, I made a conscious choice to slow down my career and prioritise my children during their formative years. Open communication with my leaders and team at work was crucial. They understood my priorities and provided me with flexible work arrangements that allowed me to focus on my family. It was a juggling act for sure, but one that honed my multitasking skills—managing office meetings while ensuring that the children completed their homework. Time management was the key here. I set clear boundaries between work and personal time. I try to find time to check off my bucket list items every now and then. Recently, I was able to fulfill my dream by swimming the English Channel.I strategically pursued paths offering lateral growthSandhya Muddu | Technology leader, Dell technologiesAs a curious student, I was drawn to technology, but it wasn’t until I became a mother that I fully grasped its significance in modern life. This realisation led me to immerse myself in the world of technology, eventually landing me a leadership position at Dell Technologies. During my early career, the technological landscape was vastly different, with limited resources and few female role models. As a mother striving for a successful career, making enduring decisions was my primary challenge. I strategically pursued paths offering lateral growth when vertical advancement wasn’t feasible. Along my journey, I took two career breaks as well— for maternity leave and to support my daughter’s career aspirations. Despite challenges, I prioritised leadership and innovation over technical specialization, finding fulfilment in my career. Reflecting on my journey, I have learned success isn’t just about academic achievements or technical prowess. It’s about recognising opportunities, overcoming obstacles, and making a meaningful impact. For aspiring techie mothers, I suggest cultivating an ecosystem that encompasses robust family support, a balanced mindset, guidance from mentors or coaches, reliable assistance, and dedication to continuous learning.Upskill, stay updated during breaksSampoorna Rath | Engineering manager, IDE delivery community group, CognizantA few years ago, I chose to take a career break and focus on my family. This decision wasn’t easy, but it was necessary. I wanted to enjoy motherhood. Even though I was concerned about reentering the workforce, I was determined to stay relevant and kept myself updated with technology trends. The hiatus was a special time as I welcomed the arrival of my baby boy. When my son turned two, I felt it was time for me to resume my career. Though I had limited options, I refused to give up the search for the right opportunity. This is when I came across Cognizant’s Returnship program, which is now a part of ‘Shakti’, the company’s holistic framework of policies and programs aimed at helping women reach their full potential. For me, it was a beacon of hope and I applied to the 3-month paid program for professionals ready to return to work after a career break, which paved the way for a smooth transition into my new role as an engineering manager. Today, I oversee five pod teams with a renewed sense of purpose.Perfection is an illusion no mother should chaseDhanashree Bhat | Chief operating officer, Persistent SystemsPerfection is an illusion no working mother should chase. There’s no such thing as the perfect professional, mom, or homemaker. Instead, one should aim to be an empathetic and inclusive professional, a loving mom, and an understanding partner. Celebrating our small achievements, such as dedicating eight productive work hours, writing a quality code, or picking up your child from school, can significantly boost your morale and sense of accomplishment. Working mothers can manage stress and maintain balance by compartmentalising responsibilities: dedicated work time, personal development, and quality family time. It’s not about the hours but how you spend that time. An engaging dinner conversation and listening to your child can be a powerful bonding experience as you give them your undivided attention. We need to overcome stereotypes that women can’t travel for work or spend long hours at the office when the situation arises. I have surprised many colleagues by being the only woman in the boardroom. By defying these stereotypes in the workplace and practicing selfcompassion, I’ve not only opened doors for myself but also set an empowering example for my daughter.Setbacks are absolutely finePoornima Krishnan | Technical consulting engineer, Cisco IndiaI have always been passionate about technology, and despite the demands of my career, I’ve always dreamed of starting a family. However, I was worried about balancing motherhood along with my career. I was overjoyed and eagerly planning for the arrival of my first child. However, my pregnancy journey took unexpected turns during the pandemic, adding layers of anxiety and uncertainty. Virtual doctor appointments replaced in-person visits, and social distancing measures limited physical connections with loved ones. After giving birth to my son, the biggest challenge was finding a way to balance motherhood with my job. There were sleepless nights and moments of doubt if I could handle it all. It’s essential to establish boundaries and prioritise tasks effectively. Learning to delegate and saying no when necessary, can help maintain a healthy balance. We should always look for companies with a supportive workplace culture that values work-life balance and supports employees who are parents. At Cisco, we have policies such as parental leave and childcare assistance to help employees. My advice to younger women techies who are looking to start a family is to remember that setbacks and failures are simply part of the journey toward success.Do some yoga, don’t ignore healthSusnata Singh | Director, data & analytics, global services, FISERVAs a mother of two daughters aged 14 and nearly nine and being the director of data & analytics for global services at Fiserv, I have learned to balance motherhood and my career to ensure that I am able to achieve my full potential. My dual role as a mother and data engineer has refined my strategic long-term planning skills, which are essential in developing technology roadmaps and bridging the gap between business needs and engineering solutions. These capabilities have also been pivotal as I have achieved the status of ‘Expert Engineer’, a distinguished cohort at Fiserv, which has given me an opportunity to influence technology roadmaps and maintain a broad vision to understand organisational dynamics. My advice to young techies planning families is to embrace this journey with resilience and adaptability. Open communication with your family, your support network, and your colleagues is key. Alongside this, motherhood has taught me the importance of prioritising health in tandem with family and professional responsibilities a discipline I have also passed onto my daughters, introducing them to yoga at an early age.Swapping laptops for diapers is a changeMegha Sethi | Associate director, KPMG in IndiaBalancing motherhood with a tech career demands determination, flexibility, adaptability and lots of support. It’s a swap between the laptop with the diapers, meetings with school activities and an understanding that no one has it all together all the time. I have been independent and travelling since school and now mother to a 7-year-old spirited mini me. Each milestone — first words, first smiles, first day of school — all are a testimony to the boundless love that she brings in our life. Some of the best advice that helped me navigate the dual role of being a mother and a professional is to find support networks, let go of the mom guilt, prioritise self-care, be flexible and be imperfectly happy. As I look back, it has been a symphony of laughter and tears, of love and resilience, of growth and transformation. I am discovering that the true beauty of motherhood isn’t in the destination but the amazing journey of raising the extraordinary little human and also discovering the depth of my own heart along the way.I had to take a 7-yr breakPringshi Nath | Manager, software development engineering, India, western digitalAs an engineer and a mother of two, my day can be a balancing act between work and tending to my family’s needs. Like many working parents, there are times when I get overwhelmed and feel guilty for prioritising one over the other. I’ve also faced difficult decisions around my career due to family priorities, when I took a 7-year professional break to cater to my family’s needs. I joined Western Digital after this long professional hiatus, as I was fuelled with determination to restart my career. Western Digital acknowledges the unique challenges faced by working parents and actively promotes work-life balance through various policies. The unwavering support from my family and the encouragement from my manager and team at the company were instrumental in guiding me through the initial period of returning to work. What advice would I have given myself at the start of this journey? Believe in yourself, cultivate a support system, seek flexibility at work, and embrace your motherhood journey with courage and pride. By balancing our dual roles, we set examples for our children, imparting invaluable lessons in resilience, ambition, and the importance of prioritising self-care.Be prepared to make compromisesAlamelu Krishnamani | Director, strategic planning, honeywell technology solutions IndiaIn the world of engineering, we often seek defined processes and clear approaches for everything. However, juggling motherhood with professional responsibilities doesn’t come with a playbook and remains a challenge for many of us, myself included. It’s about making tough choices, whether it’s missing a business dinner or sacrificing movie time with loved ones. The key is acceptance without apology. I joined Honeywell long before marriage and now have a beautiful 17-year-old daughter. Navigating motherhood alongside my career required prioritisation, delegation, and meticulous organisation. While I initially aspired to be a ‘supermom’ doing it all, I soon realised it was draining. Embracing support from my extended family was crucial. It provided me with invaluable time for myself and my work, while also enriching my daughter’s life with strong bonds and new skills. My workplace, Honeywell, has been an immense source of support. Openly discussing personal challenges and seeking assistance from my managers and buddies resulted in flexibility and understanding when I needed it most. Honeywell fosters a familyfriendly culture, with initiatives like ReConnect for women employees helping them to have a smooth transition back to work once their maternity leave is over.Motherhood is a source of strengthJyothsna Kuchimanchi | Senior director, software engineering, optum IndiaBalancing the demands of motherhood with the ever-evolving tech landscape has become an art of adaptability and resilience. There were moments when I questioned my ability to keep pace with innovation while attending to my family’s needs. Yet, with a robust support system, I’ve discovered that motherhood can be a source of strength rather than a hindrance. My “Eureka” moment arrived unexpectedly during a leisurely stroll with my son in the park. Stepping away from the screen and immersing myself in the simple joys of motherhood sparked breakthroughs in my tech endeavours. It reminded me that inspiration often resides beyond the confines of algorithms and code. One of my most significant challenges involved letting go of perfectionism and embracing the concept of “good enough.” Striving for flawlessness can lead to burnout. Instead, I’ve learned to prioritise tasks, delegate when necessary, and celebrate incremental victories. Motherhood has sharpened my problem-solving skills, refined my time management abilities, and deepened my empathy for colleagues and clients alike. Motherhood need not be a barrier to success. Rather, it’s an opportunity to harness innate strengths and unleash untapped potential in the dynamic tech world.","There is no such thing as doing it all alone.

"Small cars not disappearing anywhere, says Maruti Suzuki",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/small-cars-not-disappearing-anywhere-says-maruti-suzuki/articleshow/109990298.cms,"NEW DELHI: Undeterred by the diminishing demand for compact cars that are fast losing business to SUVs , Maruti Suzuki on Thursday said the category ""is not disappearing anywhere"", asserting that it will ""not give up on small cars "".The company is also ""considering"" to drive in electric mini cars , even though its first green vehicle will be an SUV. Demand for small cars is likely to come back over the coming years even though the segment has seen its share in total car sales contract by nearly half over the past four years, said Hisashi Takeuchi, MD & CEO of Maruti Suzuki.The country's largest carmaker has built its foundations on mini cars, such as, Maruti800, Alto, Zen, WagonR, Swift, and Baleno, since it began operations in 1983.However, after the boom in demand for SUVs, which now account for 50% share in passenger vehicle segment, share of small cars has declined to 28% at FY24-end against over 50% a few years back.In FY24, 12 lakh small cars were sold in the country (against total sales of around 40 lakh units), with Maruti accounting for 68% (on total volumes of 8.1 lakh units.)Takeuchi, after introducing new-gen version of Swift, said despite pressures, Maruti ""still makes money"" on sale of small cars. ""We continue to maintain a high market share in the category. Sooner or later, as the economy starts to pick up, demand for small cars will return.""Ravi Bhatia, India president of automobile research firm JATO Analytics, said small car category has seen rise in pressure due to increasing popularity of similarly-priced mini SUVs. ""The faux SUVs are new hatches,"" he said, adding, despite fall in small car sales, numbers of Swift grew 10% last year.First introduced in May 2005, Swift is one of Maruti's most-successful mini cars and has sold nearly 30 lakh units till now. Maruti has spent Rs 1,450 crore to upgrade the model, and believes that new version will help revive the category.","The company is also ""considering"" to drive in electric mini cars.

SBI declared a dividend of Rs 13.7 per share.According to Rajul Malani, an analyst with Sharekhan, the net interest margin was better than expected, supported by strong fee income and higher treasury gains. Operating expenses were lower mainly due to reduced provisions for wage settlements. Credit costs remained low, and asset quality improved quarter-on-quarter due to reduced slippages and increased recoveries/write-offs.The bank's margins improved because the bank's credit growth during the quarter outpaced deposit growth.

Buying gold jewelllery? Things To Keep In Mind

When purchasing gold jewellery with diamonds or other gemstones, it is crucial to weigh the gold and the gemstones separately to determine the cost accurately. Unethical jewellers may weigh the entire piece together and calculate the price based on the gold's cost, which can be problematic when the customer wants to sell or exchange the jewellery later, as only the gold's value will be considered, and the stone's weight will be deducted.

To ensure transparency, the bill issued by the jeweller should include all relevant information about the gold jewellery, as per the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS). The gold jewellery bill should mention description of the gold item, net weight of precious metal, purity in carat and fineness of gold item, and hallmarking charges. If the jewellery contains diamonds or other gemstones, their price must be listed separately on the bill.

It is essential to ensure that the purchased gold jewellery has BIS hallmarking, which became mandatory from June 16, 2021. The revised hallmarking signs, effective from July 1, 2021, include the BIS logo, purity/fineness grade, and a 6-digit unique alphanumeric code (HUID code). Starting from April 1, 2023, jewellers are not allowed to sell gold jewellery without the HUID code.

It's a prevalent practice for customers to exchange their old gold jewellery for new pieces. When purchasing new gold jewellery, it's crucial to know the exchange policies of the jeweller. Some jewellers provide 100% of the gold value for exchanges but only 90% of the gold value if opting for cash instead. Moreover, it's advisable to inquire about any resale value for the diamonds or gemstones in the jewellery.

Gold jewellery prices: Gold prices have recently reached unprecedented levels, with the cost of 24 karat gold surpassing Rs 75,000 per 10 grams. As the precious metal becomes more expensive, it is crucial for buyers to comprehend how jewellers determine the price of gold jewellery. Several factors contribute to the total amount a buyer must pay for a piece of gold jewellery, including the current gold price, making charges, and the cost of any diamonds or other gemstones incorporated into the piece.Given the long-standing tradition of purchasing gold in various forms, such as jewellery and coins, particularly on auspicious occasions like Akshaya Tritiya, it is essential for Indians to conduct thorough research before making a purchase.It is important to note that gold prices can vary between jewellers. Vikas Singh, MD & CEO, MMTC-PAMP told ET's Preeti Motiani, ""The price of gold jewellery varies from one jeweller to another due multiple reasons like differences in the cost of acquiring the gold, including expenses such as refining and transportation. When pricing gold jewellery, jewellers typically charge a making charges ranging from 10% to 25%. The difference in pricing also stems from the purity or karatages of the gold used.""The price of gold varies based on the karat (KT) of the jewellery, such as 24KT, 22KT, 18KT, or 14KT. Higher karat gold, like 24KT, is more expensive due to its purity, while lower karat gold, like 14KT, is relatively cheaper.In addition to the gold price, jewellers charge making charges, also known as wastage charges. These charges can be calculated either per gram or as a percentage of the prevailing gold price. Some jewellers use a combination of both methods, such as charging 1% of the gold price per gram. For instance, if the price of 22KT gold is Rs 68,000 per 10 grams, the making charges would be Rs 680 per gram (1% of Rs 68,000). So, for a 10-gram gold chain, the making charges would amount to Rs 6,800 (Rs 680 per gram X 10 grams).Also Read | When will gold prices hit Rs 2 lakh mark? Here’s what experts say Furthermore, GST is applied to the total cost of the gold jewellery, which includes the making charges. Hallmarking charges are also levied, as selling hallmarked gold is mandatory.To illustrate the calculation process, consider a scenario where a jeweller lists 22KT gold at Rs 65,000 per 10 grams and 18KT gold at Rs 56,000 per 10 grams. A customer purchases an 11-gram 22KT gold chain and a diamond ring with 3.5 grams of 18KT gold. The making charges are a flat rate of Rs 500 per gram. As the jewellery items have different karats, the calculations will be performed separately for each item."," jewellers use the following formula: Final price of the jewellery = {Price of gold X (Weight in grams) + Making charges + GST at 3%+ Hallmarking charges.

Setback for Musk's Neuralink: First human brain implant encounters technical glitch,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/setback-for-musks-neuralink-first-human-brain-implant-encounters-technical-glitch/articleshow/109995041.cms,"NEW DELHI: Elon Musk 's ambitious startup Neuralink has encountered a significant hiccup in its first human brain implant trial. The device, designed to help paralyzed individuals control technology through thought, began detaching from the skull of the test subject, 29-year-old Noland Arbaugh, reducing its data capture capability. This issue arose just weeks after the company showcased the device's functionalities in a live demonstration.Arbaugh, paralyzed from the shoulders down due to a diving accident eight years ago, was the first to undergo the implantation of Neuralink's brain-computer interface ( BCI ) in January.The interface includes 1,024 electrodes across 64 threads thinner than a human hair, intended to monitor neural activity and translate it into computer commands. However, complications arose as several threads retracted from Arbaugh's brain, leading to a decrease in the number of effective electrodes.""In response to this change, we modified the recording algorithm to be more sensitive to neural population signals, improved the techniques to translate these signals into cursor movements, and enhanced the user interface,"" Neuralink said, aiming to overcome the setback. The company noted that these refinements led to a ""rapid and sustained improvement"" in Arbaugh's performance, measured in bits per second (BPS), a standard metric for speed and accuracy in this technology.The incident has sparked concerns about the long-term viability and safety of such implants, though Neuralink confirmed that the malfunction has not posed a direct risk to Arbaugh's safety. Despite the possibility of removing the implant, the decision was made to keep it in place as adjustments appeared to rectify the issue effectively.This event marks a crucial phase in Neuralink’s journey, which began in 2016 and gained human trial approval from the US Food and Drug Administration last year after extensive animal testing. Arbaugh remains optimistic about the technology's impact, saying during a March livestream, ""Now I can literally just lie in bed and play to my heart’s content,"" until the battery of his rechargeable chip expires.Neuralink's efforts in pioneering brain-computer interface technology continue to draw global attention, balancing groundbreaking potential with the challenges of practical implementation.","Elon Musk's startup Neuralink has encountered a significant hiccup in its first human brain implant trial.

Tim Cook can't run Apple forever. Who's next?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/tim-cook-cant-run-apple-forever-whos-next/articleshow/109990265.cms,"Tim Cook has transformed Apple since taking over as CEO from Steve Jobs in 2011, introducing new product categories (the smartwatch), pushing into new businesses (streaming video), and making an audacious attempt to take a new type of computing (mixed reality) mainstream. He's served for far longer than the average Fortune 500 CEO, and, at 63, is older than many of his peers.But if it seems like a logical time for Cook to start planning for someone else to shape Apple's next chapter, the situation is complicated by the lack of someone who's both ready immediately and likely to be a long-term successor.Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst at Sanford C Bernstein who's covered Apple for two decades, says succession has become a topic among investors. ""You look down the list of executives, and it's really not clear how this all pans out,"" he says. ""You wonder why there hasn't been more transparency and exposure for the next leaders. It raises a broader question: Does Apple have a comprehensive and deliberate set of succession plans?""Several people familiar with Apple's inner workings recently discussed the issue with Bloomberg Businessweek, requesting anonymity to speak about the sensitive subject. If Cook were to step down soon, these people say, he would almost assuredly be replaced by COO Jeff Williams , who emerged as the top candidate to be Cook's successor a few years ago. In 2015, Cook named Williams Apple's first COO since Cook himself held that role under Jobs. That same year, Williams shepherded the first major new product in the Cook era, the Apple Watch, to market. And, four years later, he replaced Ive as the head of hardware and software design. But Williams, who's 61 this year, is only two years Cook's junior, and company insiders say they think it's now unlikely he'll be the new long-term chief.People within Apple say the most likely successor would be John Ternus , the hardware engineering chief. In a company whose success has always come from building category-defining gadgets, the ascension of a hardware engineering expert to the CEO job would seem logical. Ternus, who's not yet 50, would also be more likely than other members of the executive team to stick around for a long time, potentially providing another decade or more of Cook-esque stability.""He has a lot of managerial characteristics like Tim."" Christopher Stringer, a former top Apple hardware designer, called Ternus a ""trustworthy hand"" who's ""never failed with any role he's been elevated to."" Eddy Cue, the Apple executive known as Cook's closest confidant, has privately told colleagues that Ternus should be the next CEO, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.Other names that come up include Craig Federighi, head of software engineering, a recognizable face among Apple's biggest fans who's known internally to be conversant on corporate issues well outside of his purview, and Deirdre O'Brien, its head of retail and a Cook confidant, according to one former executive. People close to the company consider them unlikely successors.","Tim Cook has transformed Apple since taking over as CEO from Steve Jobs in 2011.

Maruti Suzuki to stay focused on hatchbacks alongside SUVs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/maruti-suzuki-to-stay-focused-on-hatchbacks-alongside-suvs/articleshow/109985479.cms,"KOLKATA: Even as other automakers shift their entire focus on the fast-expanding sports utility vehicle (SUV) segment, Maruti Suzuki on Thursday reiterated its commitment to the hatchback segment as well and said this segment would continue to grow in absolute numbers as India advances towards becoming a developed economy by 2047.Arguing in favour of hatchbacks when every automaker has turned away from introducing hatchbacks and is launching only SUVs, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd managing director and CEO Hisashi Takeuchi said small cars would remain relevant in India as the market expands and more people purchase cars.Takeuchi was speaking at the launch of the fourth generation Swift, a premium hatchback that the company introduced in 2005 and is still going strong. Since then, 6.5 million units of Swift has been sold in 169 countries with India contributing to 46% or 3 million sales followed by 1.2 million in Europe and 70,000 in Japan.Takeuchi also pointed to the shift within the hatchback segment with premium hatchbacks grabbing a dominant share of the pie. ""At present, 60% of hatchbacks sold in the country are premium ones. Maruti's market share in the premium hatchback segment is 62%,"" he said.While Maruti has multiple offerings in the premium hatch segment including Baleno, Fronx (that is is another iteration of Baleno), Swift and Ignis, only Hyundai Motor with i20, Tata Motors with Altroz and Toyota Kirloskar with Glanza and Taizor are present in this segment. Of these, the Toyota cars are rebadged Maruti Suzuki products.Takeuchi said the company had invested Rs 1,450 crore in the 4th generation Swift, including engine and sheet metal dice at Suzuki Motors Gujarat plant where it will be manufactured for both India and overseas markets.""The first million Swift cars were sold in eight years. It took five years to sell the second million. The car has not only stood the test of time but shaped a better legacy,"" said Partho Banerjee, senior executive officer (marketing and sales) at Maruti Suzuki.The Swift had killed the Hyundai Getz, a premium hatch launched by the Korean company just before Maruti Suzuki launched the Swift inspired by the legendary Hayabusa motorcycle. Though several automakers had tried to launch competing products, none other than Hyundai i20 had succeeded in raking in the numbers.","Maruti Suzuki India Ltd managing director and CEO Hisashi Takeuchi said small cars would remain relevant in India. 6.5 million units of Swift has been sold in 169 countries with India contributing to 46% or 3 million sales.

SoftBank in talks with Naver over control of Line operator LY,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/softbank-in-talks-with-naver-over-control-of-line-operator-ly/articleshow/109977668.cms,"TOKYO/SEOUL: SoftBank CEO Junichi Miyakawa said on Thursday that the Japanese telecommunications firm is in talks with South Korea's Naver over control of LY Corp , which operates the popular messaging app Line.Naver said last week that ""very unusual"" administrative guidance from the Japanese government over a data leak last year required it to reduce its control of LY Corp, which is majority owned by a joint venture between SoftBank and Naver.LY Corp admitted in November last year that there had been unauthorised access of its systems by a third party via Naver's cloud system. This led to the leak of the personal data records of more than 300,000 Line users and others.Although the guidance from Japan's internal affairs and communications ministry about the data leak did not explicitly mention a sell-down, it did direct LY Corp to ""review the relationship where the outsourced company has a significant degree of capital control"" referring to Naver.LY Corp is also terminating outsourcing to Naver in response to Japan's guidance, SoftBank said in a presentation.South Korea's government said last month it is consulting with Naver and there should be no discriminatory measures against Korean companies. Historical tensions had led to trade disputes between Japan and South Korea from 2019 until last year, but the current administrations are mending ties.Japan lifted export curbs on high-tech materials to South Korea in March 2023 and South Korea's industry minister met his Japanese counterpart for the first time in six years last month.After merging Line with Yahoo Japan in 2019, Naver and SoftBank now hold 50% each in the joint venture which controls LY Corp, through a 65% stake, SoftBank documents show.LY Corp said on its website that more than 95 million monthly active users used Line in Japan as of March last year, and it had another 83 million users in Thailand, Taiwan, and Indonesia.

Japanese automaker Nissan reports 92% jump in profit as sales surge,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/japanese-automaker-nissan-reports-92-jump-in-profit-as-sales-surge/articleshow/109977186.cms,"TOKYO: Nissan 's profit for the fiscal year through March jumped 92% to 426.6 billion yen ($2.7 billion) as sales grew in all major global markets except China, the Japanese automaker said Thursday.Annual sales surged nearly 20% to 12.7 trillion yen ($81.5 billion), Nissan Motor Co. said.For the January-March quarter, profit at Nissan, based in the port city of Yokohama, edged down slightly to 101.3 billion yen ($650 million) from 106.9 billion yen.Quarterly sales rose 13% to 3.5 trillion yen ($22 billion) for the maker of the Leaf electric car , Infiniti luxury models and Z sportscars.Chief Executive Makoto Uchida said Nissan was aiming for further growth under a strategy called ""The Arc,"" kicking in from last month, focusing on electric vehicles to boost sales.""We will do this step by step with a balanced product portfolio and by implementing optimal business strategies,"" he told reporters.Nissan hopes to maintain its leadership in electric vehicles in the Japanese market with its Ariya sports-utility vehicle. Its new US models include the Armada and Murano SUVs, and the Infiniti QX80 luxury model.Nissan has said it will mass produce electric vehicles powered by next-generation batteries by early 2029, offering solid-state batteries in a range of models, including pickup trucks.In March, Nissan and domestic rival Honda Motor Co. said they will work together in developing electric vehicles and auto intelligence technology. When asked by a reporter, Uchida said he could not comment yet beyond the announcement.Nissan is projecting a 380 billion yen ($2.4 billion) profit for the year through March 2025, down 11% on year, because of development costs that will include support for suppliers.The cheap yen has generally been a plus for Japanese exporters, including automakers, by raising the value of its overseas earnings when translated into yen.But Nissan played down the perk, stressing a steady exchange rate was desirable. The cheap yen boosted Nissan's operating profit for the fiscal year ended in March by nearly 13%.Nissan sold 3.44 million vehicles globally for the fiscal year, slightly lower than its projections but better than the 3.3 million vehicles for the year before.By region, Nissan sales grew in the US, Japan and Europe, but dove 24% in China. The Chinese auto market has been challenging amid a price war in a market dominated by locals like BYD, with its strong EV offerings.Still, Nissan is expecting its global sales to rise to 3.7 million vehicles for the year through March 2025, with sales recovering in China while continuing to grow in North America, Japan and Europe.Nissan shares finished 0.9% higher in Tokyo trading, which closed before earnings were announced.","Nissan's profit for the fiscal year through March jumped 92% to 426.6 billion yen ($2.7 billion) Annual sales surged nearly 20% to 12.7 trillion yen ($81.5 billion) For the January-March quarter, profit at Nissan edged down slightly to 101.3 billion yen.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109977465,imgsize-33620,width-400,resizemode-4/109977465.jpg"
Oil prices rise after US crude stocks fall more than expected,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/oil-prices-rise-after-us-crude-stocks-fall-more-than-expected/articleshow/109957825.cms,"NEW YORK: Oil prices edged higher on Wednesday after US oil storage data showed a larger-than-expected draw in crude stockpiles as refiners ramped up output ahead of the summer driving season.Brent crude oil futures increased 52 cents, or 0.63%, to $83.68 a barrel by 12:00 p.m. EDT (1600 GMT). US West Texas Intermediate crude futures rose 65 cents, or 0.83%, to $79.03 a barrel.US crude inventories fell by 1.4 million barrels to 459.5 million barrels in the week ending May 3, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), rising slightly more than analysts' expectations.""Stronger refining activity and exports have encouraged a minor draw to crude inventories, helping unwind some of last week's large build,"" said Matt Smith, lead oil analyst at Kpler.The EIA, however, expects slower global oil demand growth for the year, a forecast report showed.A strengthening US dollar limited crude oil prices. A stronger greenback dampens oil demand by making it more expensive for investors holding other currencies.Hopes of a ceasefire in Gaza have also put some downward pressure on oil prices in recent trading sessions, with some analysts saying the risk premium on oil had declined in tandem.""Taking away the current geopolitical trigger leaves the market staring into a world of sticky inflation in the US that is countered by interest rates that not only keep the US dollar elevated but make any sort of commodity trading more expensive,"" PVM Oil analyst John Evans said.The US believes negotiations on a Gaza ceasefire should be able to close the gaps between Israel and Hamas. US Central Intelligence Agency Director Bill Burns will travel to Israel on Wednesday for talks with the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other top officials, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters.Morgan Stanley analysts said they see the geopolitical risk for oil prices dissipating as fears of further escalation in the conflict subside.Cautious expectations on supply cuts from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies (OPEC+) ahead of a June 1 policy meeting also weighed on markets.Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said on Tuesday that there had been no discussions about an oil output increase by OPEC+.This came after an earlier statement in the day in which he said the group had the option of increasing production.
