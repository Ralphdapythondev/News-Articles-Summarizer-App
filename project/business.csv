India’s stock value tops $5 trillion as Modi’s win powers rally,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/indias-stock-value-tops-5-trillion-as-modis-win-powers-rally/articleshow/111071763.cms,"India’s stock market value exceeded $5 trillion for the first time, with the latest boost coming from a commitment by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s new coalition for policy continuity in the world’s fastest-growing major economy.The country’s equity market has joined the ranks of the US, China, Japan and Hong Kong after topping the threshold last week, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It took India about six months to add the latest $1 trillion to the capitalization of companies listed on its exchanges.Indian stocks have been scaling new peaks since the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party secured sufficient support from key allies to form a coalition government , ensuring Modi’s return to power for a third straight term. The victory, alongside robust economic growth and a recent upgrade of India’s ratings outlook by S&P Global Ratings, are combining to burnish India’s appeal for global investors.The formation of the new government with most key ministers retaining their portfolios “broadly affirms policy continuity,” according to Goldman Sachs strategist Sunil Koul. India remains a market with exceptionally stable macroeconomics and earnings growth is expected to continue, driving stocks higher, Koul said in a Bloomberg Television interview last week.A distinctive feature of gains in recent years has been the extent to which millions of young Indians have taken to equity investments. Local funds, including banks and insurers, have bought more than $26 billion in shares this year, while foreigners offloaded about $3.4 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.“The once dominant foreign institutional investors are no longer the sole drivers of the market,” according to Bino Pathiparampil, head of research at Mumbai-based Elara Capital.Still, off-shore interest have started to return following the outcome of the elections.“There appears ample money on the sidelines waiting to be deployed into India from foreign regional funds and India dedicated funds,” said Chetan Seth, a strategist at Nomura Holdings Inc. “Foreigners have not been able to get enough of India largely due to concerns around valuations and are still underweight.”India’s benchmark NSE Nifty 50 Index closed at a fresh all-time high on Friday and is headed for an unprecedented ninth-straight year of gains.

"Budget 2024 income tax expectations: Modi government may lower personal tax rates, says report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2024-income-tax-expectations-modi-government-may-lower-personal-tax-rates-says-report-top-5-points/articleshow/111058341.cms,"Budget 2024 Income Tax Expectations

The sources told Reuters that a reduction in personal tax could boost consumption and increase savings for the middle class. The first source mentioned that individuals earning over Rs 15 lakh ($17,960.42) annually, up to a certain undetermined amount, may receive some tax relief.

The changes could be made to the new income tax regime introduced in 2020, where annual income up to Rs 15 lakh is taxed at rates between 5% and 20%, while earnings over Rs 15 lakh are taxed at 30%.

The second source pointed out that the personal tax rate increases six-fold when an individual's income rises from Rs 300,000 to Rs 15 lakh, which they described as ""quite steep.""

The government may also consider lowering personal tax rates for annual incomes of Rs 10 lakh, according to the first source. They added that a new threshold is being discussed for income taxed at the highest rate of 30% under the old tax system.

The second source noted that any loss of tax income to the government through tax cuts could be partially offset by increased consumption from this category of income earners.

Snowflake’s taking AI to where data resides: CEO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/snowflakes-taking-ai-to-where-data-resides-ceo/articleshow/110955730.cms,"It has been about four years since Snowflake entered the Indian market. How has the journey been so far?

How has the rise of GenAI impacted cloud-based data storage and analytics service businesses?

You have just announced Snowflake Cortex Analyst and Cortex Search…

Where else do you see Gen AI having an impact?

You say that Snowflake LLM Arctic with its mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture allows AI models to be built faster and at a fraction of the cost of traditional methods. How does it do this?

How do you see the adoption of Gen AI-based products in enterprises?

SAN FRANCISCO: “We receive five billion queries on our Data Cloud every day,” says Sridhar Ramaswamy, CEO of Snowflake, the cloud-based data platform that provides data storage, processing, and analytics solutions. The number is significant, considering Google receives an average of 8.5 billion search requests every day. Ramaswamy was speaking at the firm’s ‘Snowflake Summit 2024’ in San Francisco earlier this week, where the company announced a slew of new technologies that “take AI to where data resides”. The company also announced a tie up with Nvidia that will allow Snowflake customers and partners to build AI-powered applications. Ramaswamy, an IIT Madras alumnus who was in Google for over 15 years and who was appointed CEO of Snowflake in Feb, spoke to TOI on the sidelines of the summit. Excerpts:Snowflake operates in two buckets in India. One is with India-based customers like Swiggy, Urban Company, and Piramal Capital, so they can unlock the full value of their data. The second pertains to the trend of American companies moving their core infrastructure to India. We are investing heavily in having a presence in India, in training more people on Snowflake. Companies like Morgan Stanley, for example, have their very senior staff in India taking care of data operations using Snowflake. We have close to 500 people in our Pune centre of excellence, and a lot more expansion is to come.Generative AI is going to have an impact from bottom to top in the stack. For example, there’s a Snowflake feature that transcribes videos, and after indexing the text, you can create a chatbot based on it. And the thing that people are most excited about is that instead of getting a bunch of links, you get answers. We also help them get grounded, cited answers, so that they know where the answers are coming from. Our value prop at Snowflake is to create a single unified product, where things like AI are tightly integrated, and we see ourselves as more an AI Data Cloud.Cortex Analyst is a bit of a North Star for the business analytics area — it will let a business user talk to their data and get answers back. If a business user asks an unreasonable question, the product will say ‘no’. As soon as you give people a chatbot, they start asking ridiculous things like ‘what is my revenue going to be 15 years from now’. A piece of SQL is certainly not going to give you that information. I generally see AI as an enhancer for data access and visualisation. Cortex Analyst is all about asking natural language questions of structured data. Cortex Search is about getting documents indexed so that you can create a chatbot very easily.In cleaning data, for instance. Data has always been messy. There’s no magic wand making sure that you have clean data. For example, think about all the documents that you have consumed. Whenever you search, for example, you are going to run into outdated documents. Making sure that these are marked as outdated or updated will be an ongoing event. We see language models helping with several of these problems. Companies currently spend millions of dollars every year just on data engineering – for cleaning up data, and getting it into a good place.Just like standard AI models, MoE is a stack of parameters, one on top of each other. There are often 24 to 32 layers of neurons that are different kinds of behaviour and connections. In dense models like GPT-3, when a new token (unit of input like a word, an image, etc) comes in for training, it ends up affecting every parameter (GPT-3 has approximately 175 billion parameters) at every layer. For instance, you take a sentence, mask a word in it, and ask the model to predict the word by feeding this sentence in. In the process, every token ends up affecting all parameters and this just makes it computationally expensive to update the model to train on a large amount of data. With MoE, you do an arbitrary subdivision of the token space and, during training, you will have portions of the neural network that get activated for different buckets of tokens (instead of having to impact all the parameters). So, you end up constructing models that are a combination of dense networks that are activated for every token, and sparse experts that are activated only partially. Now, this process can end up producing models that are almost as good as the dense models, but for a smaller amount of compute. And, you can train models faster and more efficiently.Canva, Zoom and Bayer and many others are harnessing Cortex AI to create applications and drive productivity. We have several hundred others building applications to talk to their enterprise data with natural language for business-critical decision making.","Sridhar Ramaswamy is CEO of Snowflake, a cloud-based data platform that provides data storage, processing, and analytics solutions.

Expert insights

Key takeaways

Achieving a financial goal of Rs 1 crore is a common aspiration for many investors. The amount required to be invested regularly to reach this goal can vary significantly depending on the time frame and the expected rate of return on investments . Here’s a look at how much you would need to invest to accumulate Rs 1 crore over 10, 15, and 20 years.Here is a calculation from the Economic Times how to grow a corpus of Rs 1 crore and in how many year:To accumulate Rs 1 crore in 10 years, investors need to save a substantial amount regularly, given the shorter time frame. Assuming an annual return of 12%, which is achievable through aggressive investments in equity mutual funds or stocks, the monthly investment required would be approximately Rs 44,640.For a longer time horizon of 15 years, the power of compounding works more effectively. Assuming the same annual return of 12%, the required monthly investment would be significantly lower, around Rs 21,020. This demonstrates the benefit of starting early and allowing investments more time to grow.With a 20-year investment horizon , the monthly investment required drops even further, leveraging the extended period for compounding. At an expected annual return of 12%, an investor would need to invest approximately Rs 10,880 per month to reach the Rs 1 crore target.As per the ET report, financial advisors emphasize the importance of disciplined investing and choosing the right mix of assets to maximize returns. “Equity mutual funds have historically provided around 12% annual returns over the long term, making them a suitable choice for long-term goals like accumulating Rs 1 crore,” says Rohit Shah, a Mumbai-based financial planner.However, investors should be aware of market risks and ensure their investment strategy aligns with their risk tolerance and financial goals. Diversification and periodic review of the investment portfolio are also crucial to stay on track.Start early: The earlier you start investing, the lower the monthly investment required to reach your goal.Consistent investing: Regular, disciplined investing is essential to accumulate wealth over time.Right investment vehicles: Choosing the right investment options, like equity mutual funds, can provide the necessary returns to meet your financial goals.Review and adjust: Periodically review your investments and make adjustments as needed to stay aligned with your goals and risk tolerance.By understanding these principles and planning accordingly, investors can effectively work towards accumulating Rs 1 crore over their chosen time frame.","The amount required to be invested regularly to reach this goal can vary significantly depending on the time frame and the expected rate of return on investments.

This change, effective from Monday, is part of the semi-annual review conducted by S&P Dow Jones Indices.Adani Ports' inclusion in the Sensex marks a major milestone for the company. As one of India's leading port developers and operators, APSEZ has shown substantial growth in market value and operational performance. The company’s ability to handle increasing cargo volumes and its strategic expansions have contributed to its rising prominence in the Indian market.Wipro's exit from the Sensex, on the other hand, highlights the dynamic and competitive nature of the index. Despite being a significant player in the IT sector, Wipro's recent market performance has not been sufficient to maintain its position within the top 30 companies listed on the Sensex.Based on Nuvama's projections, the inclusion of Adani Ports Special Economic Zone (APSEZ) is anticipated to bring in passive inflows amounting to $259 million, along with the addition of 14.9 million shares, an Economic Times report said.Conversely, the exclusion of Wipro is expected to result in outflows of approximately $170 million.Over the past year, Adani Ports shares have experienced a significant surge of nearly 98%, although they have slightly retreated from their 52-week high of Rs 1,621.40 on the NSE. The stock's performance has outpaced that of Wipro, which has delivered returns of 27% during the same period, the ET report said.Just before the market's closing bell, Adani Ports shares were trading at Rs 1,489.75 on the NSE, registering a gain of Rs 20.35 or 1.38%. Simultaneously, Wipro shares were trading near Rs 491, experiencing a minor decline of Rs 1.15 or 0.23%.Market analysts are closely observing these developments, with some expecting a reallocation of funds by institutional investors to align with the new index composition. The changes in the Sensex are anticipated to influence investment strategies and portfolio adjustments, given the index's critical role as a benchmark for the Indian stock market.","Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone is set to join the prestigious 30-stock index, replacing Wipro.

NEW DELHI: GST Council on Saturday decided to exempt all hostel fees, platform ticket, railway waiting room and golf cart charges as well as employee stock options from payment of tax, while reworking the system to register for the tax regime to check frauds by bogus entities.While hostels run by education institutions were already exempt from GST, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said now all hostels will be exempted from the levy provided the monthly charges are under Rs 20,000 per person and the occupant stays at the facility for at least 90 days.The move will also benefit thousands of students and working people staying in paying guest accommodations. There was relief for corporate guarantees, reinsurance, where certain clarifications have been issued, and for e-commerce players, too, as the tax collected at source on net taxable supplies will be halved to 0.5%.There were clarifications allowing 12% tax on all types of milk cans, solar cookers and paper cartons. Further, compensation cess on supply of aerated beverages and energy drinks to authorised customers by defence canteens have also been exempted.The all-powerful body comprising the Union and state FMs also recommended amendments to the CGST Act for not levying tax on extra neutral alcohol used for manufacture of alcoholic liquor for human consumption.There were clarifications allowing 12% tax on all types of milk cans, solar cookers and paper cartons.

The move meant to combat fraudulent input tax credit claims made through fake invoices will require registration at GST Suvidha Kendras or facilitation centres, which, Sitharaman said, should not take more than 15 minutes or so.She also said that several items related to review of tax rates were not taken up in Saturday’s meeting but there were a host of changes, including an amnesty scheme for defaulters, to make life easier for businesses.A big relief will come in the form of the Centre’s decision to fix thresholds for appealing to GST Appellate Tribunal (Rs 20 lakh), high courts (Rs 1 crore) and Supreme Court (Rs 2 crore). Govt does not intend to file an appeal in case the amount involved, other than policy issues, is under the threshold, said revenue secretary Sanjay Malhotra.Similarly, the pre-deposit amount for taxpayers to file appeals has also been cut.Further, interest and penalty will be waived, in case a taxpayer who was served a notice under Section 73 of the CGST Act during FY18 to FY20 agreed to clear the demand by March. The section deals with cases where full tax has not been paid or was erroneously refunded or where input tax credit was wrongly availed or utilised for any reason, other than fraud. There were several other procedural relaxations that were cleared by the council.“Dispute resolution requires a multi-faceted approach. We advocate for an amnesty scheme, a national authority for advance rulings, and full appointment of the Goods and Services Tax Appellate Tribunal. Industry engagement and audit efficiency can be improved through sectoral committees and standardised compliance manuals,” said Saurabh Agarwal, tax partner at consulting firm EYIndia.","GST Council on Saturday decided to exempt all hostel fees, platform ticket, railway waiting room and golf cart charges from payment of tax. There was relief for corporate guarantees, reinsurance, and for e-commerce players, too, as the tax collected at source on net taxable supplies will be halved to 0.5%.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111196200,imgsize-222328,width-400,resizemode-4/111196200.jpg"
New GST era set to start with end of anti-profiteering clause,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-gst-era-set-to-start-with-end-of-anti-profiteering-clause/articleshow/111195828.cms,"NEW DELHI: While deciding to do away with the anti-profiteering clause , which mandates sellers to pass on benefit of tax cuts , GST Council Saturday signalled its intent to transition to the next stage with rationalisation , including a possible reduction in slabs, as well as roadmap for compensatiocess on products such as cars, coal, cola and tobacco will be taken up at its next meeting scheduled for end of August.The panel of finance ministers headed by Union FM Nirmala Sitharaman decided to end the ant-profiteerng provision from April, which means that from next fiscal year, sellers or service providers cannot be hauled up in case they do not pass on benefit of tax cuts to consumers. Existing cases will be handled by principal bench of GST Appellate Tribunal, an official statement said.Sitharaman also said that some of the group of ministers have been recast as 11 new finance ministers have joined the Council with the one on rationalisation, now headed by Bihar deputy CM Samrat Chaudhary, been asked to make a presentation at the next meeting of the all-powerful body, which is likely to be held after a couple of months. “When GST Council meets next, GoM will make a presentation and discussion on rationalisation will start,” FM said while stating that a decision may not be taken during the meeting itself. It is unlikely that the ministers are going to rush ahead with a decision given that crucial assembly polls are due at the end of the year.At Saturday’s meeting, Karnataka sought a discussion on compensation cess that is levied on several products to cover the “revenue loss” states. While the cess was for five years, it had to be extended up to March 2026 following the outbreak of Covid-19 as state had to borrow from the market to meet the shortfall in collections. With borrowings likely to be repaid only in 2025-26, the GST Council will deliberate on the future of the levy and the sharing formula in case some amount is left in the kitty after repaying the loans.Asked about including petrol and diesel within the ambit of GST, FM said that the law has a provision for their inclusion but it was for the states to first decide on it and then fix the rate of tax. Responding to another query, revenue secretary Sanjay Malhotra said the issue of GST exemption for fertiliser too has been referred to the group of ministers.",The panel of finance ministers headed by Union FM Nirmala Sitharaman decided to end the ant-profiteerng provision from April.

The finance minister set the stage for a ""Viksit Bharat by 2047"", on the core principles of ‘Sabka Saath’, ‘Sabka Vikas’, ‘Sabka Vishwas’, with ‘Sabka Prayas’ being added as a new theme in the interim Budget.This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data i.e., farmer welfare and N for Nari utthan i.e., support for women entrepreneurs. These form the pillars of a comprehensive inclusive development. The Government's commitment to sustainable development under the strategy for Amrit Kaal includes achieving 'Net Zero' by 2070, rooftop solarization for one crore households and robust health initiatives.The Indian economy's resilience takes center stage amidst positive indicators of declining current account deficit as a percentage of GDP, falling unemployment rates, and a notable rise in digital transactions. These statistics affirm the robustness of the economy, showcasing a trajectory of growth and stability.The achievements in taxation reforms are nothing short of remarkable, with direct tax collections more than trebling in the last decade, the number of tax return filers increasing by 2.4 times, average processing time of tax returns plummeting from 93 days in FY 2013-14 to an impressive 10 days in FY 2023-24, resulting in issuance of quick refunds. These are the results of consistent progressive measures thus obviating the need for, and rightly avoiding, any last-minute populist measures.No change in existing tax rates, both for direct and indirect taxes, is a good indicator of stability and predictability for investors and taxpayers.A welcome move to waive outstanding tax demands that are minor, disputed, and unreconciled. This involves the withdrawal of outstanding direct tax demands up to Rs. 25,000 pertaining to the period up to FY 2009-10 and up to Rs.10,000 for FY 2010-11 to 2014-15.The Government's commitment to fostering a business-friendly environment is evident in its intent to extend specific tax benefits for start-ups, investments by sovereign wealth funds/ pension funds, and certain IFSC units. The extension has been made now until March 31, 2025. This might help in creating a conducive landscape for business.To align with the CBDT notification issued earlier, the provisions relating to tax collection at source concerning remittances under the Liberalized Remittance Scheme have now been formally incorporated in the Finance Bill, 2024, setting the rate at 20% for amounts exceeding Rs. 7 lakhs in a financial year.The Finance Bill, 2024 proposes an extension of the time limit for introducing the faceless scheme by the Central Government for transfer pricing proceedings, DRP Proceedings, and ITAT Proceedings, up to March 31, 2025.The interim Budget 2024 may not have proposed significant tax announcements, but it very well positioned the prelude to the full budget post the upcoming elections. Considering the potential impact on the population across the four pillars of GYAN, a sizable portion of India stands to be covered. The interim Budget’s focus on the tax front resembles a report card, highlighting the maturity achieved by our tax system. The enhancement of taxpayer services was emphasized as a key priority.","This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data and N for Nari utthan.

The Finance Minister on February 01, 2024, delivered a truly innovative interim budget. At first glance, it did not seem like an interim budget but looked more like the budget to drive further growth and a continuum of inclusive growth-oriented investments.At the outset, this budget brings a wonderful balance between fiscal prudence and continued investment for growth. It's not easy to continue the glide path of reducing the fiscal deficit and continuing to make significant investments in all areas including infrastructure, R&D, energy transition, technology, skilling, and social welfare. The surprising reduction in fiscal deficit of 5.8% as against the budgeted 5.9% for FY24 and the projection of 5.1% in FY25 with a clear focus on increasing investments was a huge positive.This was a budget for everyone and all because it caters to every part of the Indian economy and society. The FM has carefully catered to the investment needs of various sectors. The continued focus on youth, impoverished, women and farmers to increase their involvement and contribution to economic growth is evident. By committing an 11.1% increase in capital expenditure to 11,11,111 lakh crore, the FM has clearly brought every single 1 in this growth journey.What was very impressive was the inclusion strategy of the government. The focus on women's empowerment for the past few years is unprecedented, which is reflected in the inclusion of women in the workforce moving from 23.3% to 37% in the last five years. The thirty crore Mudra Yojna loans to women entrepreneurs were a great boost to the Nari Shakti initiative. We already have over 10 million Lakhpati Didis and what is truly evident is like a corporate CFO, the FM has revised the earlier target of 20 million Lakhpati Didis to 30 million. The government also plans to invest in initiatives to encourage young girls between the ages of 9 and 14 to undertake the vaccination for cervical cancer which is again a great boost to Nari Shakti.A lot needs to be done to bring more women into all parts of economic growth but the journey so far and the vision of the future is truly inspiring.While India continues on its technological prowess and makes its mark in new technologies like Artificial Intelligence, we need a multi-pronged strategy to harness the power of AI. We need a clear focus on building AI systems in India so that we not only emerge as a global leader in this new era but can build models, which are specific to India that will benefit Indians. At the same time, we need a very wide coverage program to build skills to leverage AI to its fullest potential. The biggest contribution we can make to the inclusion of youth in the economic development of the country is by skilling them in new skill areas. In the last few years, the Skill India Mission has trained 14 million youth, reskilled over 5 million youth and established a staggering 3,000 new ITIs. The future of any country will depend as much on capital investments as on skill investments.The focus on agricultural development and support to the farmer continues through direct financial assistance to farmers. The farmers have benefited by getting crop insurance through PM Fasal Bima Yojana. It's not just the farmers, the PM-SVANidhi provides credit assistance to a large number of street vendors.The last few years have seen the journey of affordable housing through Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY). There is a slight increase in allocation to launch a scheme for encouraging the middle class to build or buy new homes. This investment will likely propel a wider economic development and increase employment.India has seen a tremendous rise in entrepreneurship in the last few years. In order to continue the journey and promote new startups, the government proposes to extend certain tax benefits, which are expiring from March 2024 to March 2025. The MSMEs have not been left behind. With a proposal to provide timely finances to such enterprises, the government has paved the way for their growth, so they can look to compete globally.All in all, it’s a truly inclusive budget with a clear focus on development not just by giving away freebies but enabling the people to participate in the economic development activity. While the FM calls the comprehensive GDP - Governance, Development & Performance – to me, this budget is inclusive of another GDP – gender, demography, and professions.","Akhilesh Tuteja is Partner and Head, Clients and Markets, KPMG in India.

‘Enough domestic sources of demand to counter drag from external sector’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/enough-domestic-sources-of-demand-to-counter-drag-from-external-sector/articleshow/107372012.cms,"Do you think the

creates room for lower interest rates?

One of the issues that the Budget has flagged is the demographic challenge and opportunity and the societal change that is taking place. How do you view this?

Niti Aayog is working on the Viksit Bharat roadmap. What will be the focus areas?

You are as much a representative of the Centre as well as the states. Is it time to revisit the entire formula for transfers to states particularly on the issue of cesses and surcharges?

Suman Bery , who heads Niti Aayog , the govt think tank, is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China, which he says is also an opportunity for India. The economist is confident that Indian states remain resilient. Excerpts of the interview with TOI.The finance ministry expects the economy to grow 7% next year. Given the global situation, how do you see the prospects?The belief in the finance ministry is that we have a possible drag coming from the external sector but that we have other sources. We have enough domestic sources of demand. One has to applaud the political and economic judgment of FM in deciding that it was appropriate to pursue the path of fiscal consolidation. There is transparency. What this actually reflects is responsible economic management, which is one reason we are where we are. Second, it also creates a buffer so that there is policy space if we do encounter headwinds.That’s the hope and expectation. We have an independent central bank and an inflation targeting central bank, so it is up to the monetary policy committee to take a call through the monetary policy committee on the repo rate .The PM has said that when India grows its states grow. India is a composite of 37 states and UTs. They are each at very different points in their demographic transition. There are some states where the net replacement rate is down to 1%, like Kerala . There are others, particularly UP and Bihar, which are in their earliest stage of demographic transition and each one of these states is the size of a large European country. There are two implications of that — one is internal labour mobility and it will become an even larger part of our growth model. The govt has taken several steps to create a unified market. Our main endowment is our human capital and that has to be equipped to participate in global exchange in many ways. We know from China, Japan that the demographic dividend partly depends on markets and on human capital. But the golden period is fairly short lived, about 15 years, when the so called dependency ratio declines. The other big opportunity the PM has been highlighting is bringing women much more into the active labour force.When Niti was set up there was the idea of a three-year vision and a seven-year strategy paper. The reality is that schemes of govt tend to be aligned with the award of the Finance Commission . There are various established building blocks or hand holds which are already a matter of govt policy. The PM is much more interested in a national debate on what it means to be a Viksit Bharat or modern society. We have a collective goal and it is for the democratic polity to define what that goal should be. Its emphatically not for a super mandarin bureaucracy. It is not going to be Lee Kwan Yew’s Singapore led from the top.It’s entirely a finance ministry matter but I would be lying if I didn’t say when I visit certain states there is this complaint. A big frontier would be resource mobilisation at the state level. Second is going to be rationalisation of subsidies not only at the Union level, but also at the state level. All chief ministers sit on my governing council. When they convene as the governing council, I see them in their role as development practitioners.

There are enough buffers to ensure that what happens in state finances is unlikely to create macro instability. Those risks are well contained by our Constitution.

Government's Marathon to 2047: Emphasis on Fiscal Prudence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/governments-marathon-to-2047-emphasis-on-fiscal-prudence/articleshow/107371788.cms,"What was the thinking behind keeping the vote on account absolutely straight?

So is it the idea to keep the Budget completely transparent?

The capex has risen 11.1% and there is an emphasis on infrastructure spending. But there is also the hope that the private sector will now take over and start capital spending. Given the geopolitical situation, how confident is the govt that it will pan out as planned?

Finance secretary T V Somanathan, in an interview with TOI, says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047 . Excerpts:If you see the Budget speech you will see the emphasis on 2047. The govt has set its sight on running that marathon. Running to 2047 is a marathon , it’s not a sprint. If you are going to run a marathon, you need to be in good shape and you can’t have short-term stimulants or something that will get you some yards and then it’s done.The whole focus is on making India a developed country by 2047, for which a healthy present and a strong fiscal position is an important concomitant. Some purely short term measures don’t really fit into that picture. It’s a consistent picture: focus on the long term for which you need to build strength in the short term and that needs to be done by prudence in fiscal policy and by not doing things which can detract you from that path. Not doing the wrong thing is more important than appearing to do things.The idea is that govt finances may be good, bad or indifferent depending on the times, depending on the circumstances, depending on the policies. But what is the position should be reflected as reasonably and accurately as possible. That is an emphasis. As regards the Finance Commission, again the terms of reference that have been given to them are the terms in the Constitution.What is the means by which the devolution should be done is a matter they have full discretion. They can actually take all kinds of factors into account and in a sense we felt this time based on my review of the previous commissions that the right expression would be less is more. The shorter, less prescriptive terms of reference gives full scope for all stakeholders including state govts to express their viewpoints and for the commission to take a balanced view of the different perspectives and then come to its award. Ultimately the award of the Finance Commission is about devolution and grant for which full scope has now been given to them.n There are incipient signs of private capital expenditure accelerating. There are some surveys I have seen done by some of the chambers industry, which show high levels of investment. The PMI, which is a sort of leading indicator, is also looking pretty healthy. Capacity utilisation is one reason that private sector capital expenditure doesn’t immediately pick up when the economy starts accelerating because there is surplus capacity.But increasingly I get the sense that many industries are beginning to reach levels where they have to add capacity. When that happens capital investment will happen. Another pointer also mentioned in the Budget speech you may notice that our airlines have placed large orders for planes — that is capital expenditure.When you import 1,000 aircraft, it’s just not 1,000 aircraft, there are concomitant additions to ground handling facilities, you need airports to expand, you need to employ people to do that. That means a lot of jobs. The aircraft is capital but then look at the effect it is going to have on skilled jobs. So capital expenditure is happening. I am fairly confident that we will have decent capital expenditure in the year to come and that will become a new source of acceleration.",Finance secretary T V Somanathan says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047. The capex has risen 11.1% and there is an emphasis on infrastructure spending. There are incipient signs of private capital expenditure accelerating.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-107371891,imgsize-720422,width-400,resizemode-4/107371891.jpg"
What is the Section 80C limit for tax deduction for FY 2024-25 after Interim Budget 2024?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/income-tax-budget-2024-2024-2025-section-80c-limit-epf-ppf-elss-nsc/articleshow/107353021.cms,"ALSO READ |

Income Tax Changes Budget 2024 : In the recent Budget 2024 speech, the Finance Minister kept the Section 80C tax deduction limit unchanged. The maximum limit for claiming tax benefits under Section 80C remains at Rs 1.5 lakh for the current fiscal year 2023-24 and will stay the same for individuals looking to save on taxes through Section 80C investments in the upcoming fiscal year 2024-25.Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions. Individuals can reduce their gross taxable income by up to Rs 1.5 lakh per financial year by engaging in these specific investments or expenditures.You can save on taxes through Section 80C by investing in things like Employees' Provident Fund (EPF), Public Provident Fund (PPF), Equity Linked Saving Scheme (ELSS) mutual funds, National Savings Certificate (NSC), and 5-year tax-saving fixed deposits with banks or post offices. Additionally, paying life insurance policy premiums also qualifies for tax benefits under Section 80C.It is important to note that each eligible investment comes with its specific maximum limit, rate of return, liquidity, and taxation rules for the earned returns, states ET in a report. For instance, the most you can invest in PPF in a financial year is Rs 1.5 lakh. Meanwhile, there's no limit on the amount you can invest in ELSS mutual funds, but the Section 80C deduction is capped at Rs 1.5 lakh.If individuals can't make specific investments, they can still get deductions under Section 80C from their gross taxable income through certain expenses. These expenses include repaying the principal amount of a home loan, tuition fees for children, payment of stamp duty, registration fees, and other costs related to buying a house.Since the financial year 2020-21, individuals without any business income must annually choose between the old and new tax regimes. As of the fiscal year 2023-24, the new tax regime is the default option. Consequently, individuals seeking tax deductions under Section 80C must opt for the old tax regime since this deduction isn't available in the new tax regime. It's crucial for taxpayers to be aware of these rules to make informed decisions about their tax planning and investment strategies.","Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions.

Marathe, who has been declared absconding by the Mumbai Crime Branch, sought relief from arrest regarding the hoarding collapse. The Mumbai Police Crime Branch opposed this bail plea in court.Officials informed the court that the paperwork for the collapsed hoarding was completed during Marathe's tenure from 2020 to December 2023, before the current director, Bhavesh Bhide , assumed charge. So far, the Special Investigation Team (SIT) of the Mumbai Crime Branch has recorded statements from 20 people in connection with the case.The Mumbai Crime Branch recently made a second arrest in the case, detaining Manoj Ramkrishna Sanghu , who is on the BMC-approved engineer's list. Sanghu was arrested for approving the structural stability certificate on April 24, 2023, and allegedly issued this certificate to EGO Media Private LTD for the collapsed hoarding.Bhavesh Bhide, the director of Ego Media, was previously arrested by the Mumbai crime branch in Udaipur, Rajasthan, and brought back to Mumbai. Authorities are probing the awarding of the hoarding contract to Bhide and the earnings he derived from it.Mumbai police registered a case under IPC sections 304, 338, 337, and 34 against Bhavesh Bhide and others at Pantnagar police station . Following the incident, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) Commissioner stated that Maharashtra chief minister Eknath Shinde had ordered the inspection of all hoardings.The investigation remains ongoing as authorities strive to determine the full extent of responsibilities and regulatory lapses that may have contributed to the tragic incident.","Gajanan Bellale, the chief BMC officer of Ghatkopar East, has been asked to appear for questioning today.

Pakistan: Weekly inflation continues upward trend; driven by rising vegetable prices,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/pakistan-weekly-inflation-continues-upward-trend-driven-by-rising-vegetable-prices/articleshow/111182459.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Inflation based on the Sensitive Price Index ( SPI ) marked its fourth consecutive weekly increase, primarily attributed to a surge in vegetable prices , according to official data released, Dawn reported.For the week ending June 20, year-on-year SPI-based inflation escalated sharply by 23.78 per cent. The weekly comparison showed a 0.94 per cent rise.The Finance Bill 2024 proposes a range of indirect taxes that are anticipated to escalate inflation in the coming weeks. Notably, an 18 per cent sales tax is projected to impact prices of pharmaceuticals, books, stationery, and poultry products.Despite a decline in petrol prices , the impact on essential commodities is expected to be offset by rising prices of perishable vegetables such as tomatoes, onions, and potatoes. Moreover, the imposition of increased sales tax and customs duties on fresh vegetables and fruits imported from Iran and Afghanistan is likely to further fuel food inflation in the near term.Weekly inflation had peaked at a record 48.35 per cent year-on-year in early May 2023, later moderating to as low as 24.4 per cent by late August 2023, before surging beyond 40 per cent in the week ending November 16, 2023, according to Dawn.The weekly price movements indicated significant increases for items such as tomatoes (65.84 per cent), potatoes (5.61 per cent), onions (3.78 per cent), bananas (3.29 per cent), LPG (2.44 per cent), cigarettes (1.67 per cent), pulse moong (1.53 per cent), garlic (1.29 per cent), fresh milk (0.95 per cent), eggs (0.83 per cent), georgette (0.28 per cent), and shirting (0.17 per cent).Conversely, items that witnessed price declines over the previous week included petrol (3.76 per cent), diesel (0.84 per cent), rice basmati broken and pulse masoor (0.08 per cent each), and chicken (0.05 per cent).On an annual basis, notable price increases were recorded for Q1 gas charges (570 per cent), tomatoes (191 per cent), onions (122.66 per cent), chillies powder (54.81 per cent), garlic (40.55 percent), shirting (30.75 per cent), salt powder (29.49 per cent), gents sandal (25.01 per cent), pulse gram (22.67 per cent), pulse mash (22.60 per cent), beef (22.12 per cent), and Q1 electricity charges (21.46 per cent).In contrast, prices decreased significantly for wheat flour (32.90 per cent), chicken (20.60 per cent), 5-liter cooking oil (16.17 per cent), 2.5 kg vegetable ghee (13.39 per cent), 1 kg vegetable ghee (12.42 per cent), bananas (11.69 per cent), mustard oil (8.24 per cent), Lipton tea (2.52 per cent), and petrol (1.38 per cent).The SPI index closed at 316.88 compared to 313.93 the previous week and 256 a year ago. This index, composed of 51 items surveyed from 50 markets across 17 cities, provides a weekly snapshot of essential commodity and service prices.Data analysis indicated that prices increased for 25 items, decreased for 5 items, and remained unchanged for 21 items compared to the previous week.","For the week ending June 20, year-on-year SPI-based inflation escalated sharply by 23.78 per cent.

Wall Street week ahead: Rally in US big tech stocks may be getting stretched,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/wall-street-week-ahead-rally-in-us-big-tech-stocks-may-be-getting-stretched/articleshow/111182179.cms,"A blistering rally in US big tech stocks may be due for a breather, offering hope for market segments that have been more tepid this year.Although the S&P 500 is up 14.6% this year, most of the broader index's gains have been concentrated in the information technology and communications sectors - up 28.2% and 24.3%, respectively. The rest of the market has been more subdued: the next best performing sector, utilities, is only up 9.5% year-to-date.Many investors believe the long-term case for tech stocks is solid, given their strong earnings and excitement over the revolutionary potential of artificial intelligence. But huge price gains, including Nvidia Corp 's 155% year-to-date run, have stirred worries that the tech rally might be overheated.Market laggards such as small caps and so-called value stocks such financials and industrials may be looking like bargains.""Nvidia has been a rocket ship, and when things go up this quickly you don't want to be the last one through the exit door,"" said Michael Purves, CEO of Tallbacken Capital Advisors. ""People want to be invested in this equity rally, and if they sell Nvidia the most likely places they are going to go is value and cyclical stocks .""A rotation out of big tech could allay concerns of concentration that have arisen in recent weeks, as themarket rally has once again narrowed to a handful of names. About 60% of the S&P 500's total return of more than 14% for the year has been driven by five companies whose shares have some of the heaviest weightings in the index: Nvidia, Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Alphabet, and Amazon.com , data from S&P Dow Jones Indices showed.Some signs of big tech exhaustion emerged in the past week. Nvidia shares are down 10% from their peak reached on Thursday, taking the chipmaker out of its short-lived position as the world's most valuable company. Nvidia is on track for a 4% decline for the week, while the S&P 500 is on track for a less than 1% gain.Closely watched economic data in the week ahead, including inflation data on Friday, could also affect investor positioning, as market participants gauge whether a nascent slowdown in inflation is continuing.Tech appears over-extended based on several barometers, Purves noted. The Relative Strength Indicator of the Mag6 Index, which measures the speed and magnitude of price changes in the stock market's six biggest stocks, is at the highest it has ever been, he said.Meanwhile, the price ratio between the Nasdaq 100 and the S&P 500 Equal Weight Index - a proxy for the average stock - has jumped 9% since the beginning of June, he said. The S&P 500, by contrast, is up nearly 4% this month.Optimism is high among retail and institutional investors, which some view as a contrarian indicator because it means the bar for positive surprises is elevated. The AAII Sentiment Survey was steady at 44% in the week ended June 19, about 8 percentage points above its historical average. Sentiment among fund managers in the latest survey by BofA Global Research was at its highest level since late 2021, with investors trimming cash positions and increasing equity allocations.The 13% month-to-date gain in the VanEck Semiconductor ETF is a sign that AI-fever might have gone too far, said Larry Tentarelli, chief technical strategist at Blue Chip Daily Trend Report.""In the near-term you could get a pullback in tech and semis, and a healthy rotation into other parts of the market that would keep this bull market going.""Even if a pullback does occur, there are few signs investors would leave tech and growth stocks for long. Betting against tech has been a losing proposition over the last decade, as the Nasdaq 100 index has advanced more than 400% while the Russell 1000 Value is up about 70% over the same time.The Russell Value index is up 5.6% this year. Investors have given an even chillier reception to small cap stocks , with the Russell 1000 down 0.5% year-to-date.Tech could rebound fairly quickly as investors rush to buy the dip. The Nasdaq 100 took five weeks to reach a new high after falling as much as 9% in April.""I don't get the sense that investors are looking to ring the register on this and book gains,"" said Jason Alonzo, portfolio manager at Harbor Capital Advisors. ""If anything, I'm seeing people who feel that they missed it trying to get in on this trend.""","The S&P 500 is up 14.6% this year.

The response from Saudi authorities has not been so positive so far.Similarly, in the case of Japan, the pitch is to corner investment from the large pension funds in the Asian giant instead of merely depending on JBIC, which finances projects with several conditions.The funding sources are in addition to traditional long-duration funds that govt has been eyeing from Canada, Australia and other parts of the world.While there are concerns around investor protection and certainty of investment, govt is seeking to address some of them through existing mechanisms, the sources said. Besides, some of the investors from the UK had raised environmental issues, including in road projects, which were addressed by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) as ESG is part of the mandate for most assignments. Govt is looking to channelise resources from multiple sources to ensure that infrastructure construction takes place in full swing as it is seen to be crucial for economic growth .A bulk of the resources are flowing into transport - highways and railways - with even the public spending of Rs 11,11,111 crore focused on these two crucial sectors. Green energy is another thrust for govt although there is significant private investment too that is flowing into the sector. Even in the Budget, FM Nirmala Sitharaman is expected to prioritise infrastructure investment as it is seen to help generate demand for steel, cement and other inputs while creating jobs.","The finance ministry and Niti Aayog are offering a list of projects, such as a ring road around a tier II city or a large highway, to investors from other countries.

Trump media stock plunges 46% following his conviction,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trump-media-stock-plunges-46-following-his-conviction/articleshow/111145637.cms,"Trump Media stock has experienced a significant decline, plunging 46% since former President Donald Trump was found guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records in his federal hush-money trial last month. The decline in the stock, which owns the Truth Social media company, has been steady but accelerated this week following the SEC's declaration of the company's S-1 filing as effective.

The stock fell by 6% on Monday, continued to decline by another 10% on Tuesday, and dropped another 10% on Thursday. The SEC's approval of the S-1 filing means more dilution is imminent for current shareholders as millions of warrants are likely to be exercised. If all warrants covered by the recently approved registration statement are exercised, it would raise approximately $247 million in cash for the company.

Trump Media CEO Devin Nunes welcomed the SEC's decision in a press release on Tuesday, stating that the cash raised from the exercise of warrants would position the company well to launch a TV streaming platform. ""With our S-1 declared effective, we're expecting to be well positioned to energetically pursue TV streaming, other enhancements to the platform, and potential mergers and acquisitions,"" Nunes said.

However, the amended S-1 filing also includes a new risk related to former President Trump's recent engagement with TikTok. The filing notes, ""If TMTG disagrees with President Donald J. Trump about the scope of his obligation to use, or first post on, Truth Social, TMTG lacks any meaningful remedy with respect to such disagreement—which could have a material adverse effect on the business and/or operations of TMTG.""

Trump has almost exclusively posted on his Truth Social media platform since he was banned from most major social media platforms following the January 6 insurrection.

This development marks a challenging period for Trump Media, highlighting the significant impacts of legal issues and regulatory decisions on the company's financial health and future prospects.","The stock fell by 6% on Monday, continued to decline by another 10% on Tuesday.
