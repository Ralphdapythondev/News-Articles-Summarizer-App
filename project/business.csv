He alleged that Tihar Jail has been transformed into a ""torture chamber"" for Kejriwal.""Whatever is happening with the elected Chief Minister of Delhi is extremely sad.

He questioned the alleged inhumane treatment of a three-time elected chief minister, suggesting that it might be due to Kejriwal's initiatives in Delhi, such as providing good treatment, free electricity and water, and implementing a scheme to give Rs 1,000 per month to mothers and sisters.Singh also raised concerns about the potential damage caused to Kejriwal's kidneys and liver by withholding his insulin, highlighting the irony that the Chief Minister, who provides free medicines to the entire city of Delhi, had to go to court for his own insulin.""Arvind Kejriwal is running the world's best government in Delhi. Do you want to see how much Kejriwal became ill and how much Kejriwal morale dropped? he asked.

'Refused to share password': What ED said in SC while opposing Kejriwal's plea against arrest,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/refused-to-share-password-what-ed-said-in-sc-while-opposing-kejriwals-plea-against-arrest/articleshow/109594147.cms,"Here's what the ED said while opposing the Delhi chief minister's plea against his arrest:

""The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is the major beneficiary of the proceeds of crime generated in the Delhi liquor scam. Part of the proceeds of crime to the tune of cash of Rs 45 cr approx. has been utilised in the election campaign of AAP in Goa Assembly elections 2022,"" it said.

""AAP has committed the offence of money laundering through Arvind Kejriwal and the offences thus are covered by section 70, PMLA 2002. He is also involved in demand of kickbacks which have inter-alia generated further proceeds of crime,"" it said.

""A total of approximately 170 mobile phones were changed/destroyed by 36 persons (accused and other persons involved) during the period of the scam and when the scam and irregularities in the Delhi Excise Policy of 2021-22 became public,"" ED has claimed.

""For investigation, Kejriwal was asked to provide a password to his mobile phones during the search on March 21, 2024 and then during ED custody, the same was asked again and his reply was recorded in his statement, wherein he refused to share the same. Even his statements during custody would reveal that despite being confronted with materials, the petitioner chose to give completely evasive answers,"" the affidavit read.

The probe agency alleged that contravention of the PMLA, particularly offences punishable under section 4 of the Act, have taken place ""with his knowledge and he didn't exercise at any time diligence to prevent such contravention"".

""For investigation, Kejriwal was asked to provide a password to his mobile phones during the search on March 21, 2024 and then during ED custody, the same was asked again and his reply was recorded in his statement, wherein he refused to share the same. Even his statements during custody would reveal that despite being confronted with materials, the petitioner chose to give completely evasive answers,"" the probe agency alleged.

""Taking advantage of the fact that he was also the CM of Delhi, he used the said post to facilitate the offence of money laundering punishable under section 4 of PMLA by the 'company' i.e. AAP and therefore, without prejudice to his role and liability for the direct commission of the said offence, he is also vicariously liable for the offence committed by the AAP, being the national convenor of the said party and because of his role and active involvement in the day to day affairs and the conduct for the business of AAP,"" it said.

The agency pointed out that the arrest of Kejriwal was made because the investigating officer is in possession of material as required under section 19 which would indicate his guilt of the offence of money laundering punishable under the PMLA.

""It is categorically denied that the arrest was mala fide. Regarding the contention pertaining to mala fide, it is submitted that not only the contentions of the petitioner is baseless and ill-founded but it is vague, general and not specific,"" it said.

It pointed out that Kejriwal was involved in the use of proceeds of crime thus generated in the Goa election campaign of the AAP to which he is the convenor and the ultimate decision maker.

(With agency inputs)

NEW DELHI: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has informed the Supreme Court that Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal played a central role in the excise policy case, acting as the ""kingpin and key conspirator.""The probe agency asserted that arresting an individual based on evidence of an offense does not undermine the principles of free and fair elections.According to the ED, Kejriwal allegedly collaborated with his ministers and AAP leaders, and was involved in ""demanding kickbacks"" from liquor businessmen in return for favors granted through the policy.The agency filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court in response to Kejriwal's plea challenging his arrest, stating that he failed to cooperate with the ED despite being summoned multiple times in connection with the excise policy case. On April 15, the top court had sought a response from the ED by April 24 on Kejriwal's plea challenging his arrest in the case.","The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has informed the Supreme Court that Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal played a central role in the excise policy case.

SC: Man can be prosecuted for misappropriating streedhan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-man-can-be-prosecuted-for-misappropriating-streedhan/articleshow/109607160.cms,"NEW DELHI: Reinforcing married women ’s right over ‘streedhan’, Supreme Court on Wednesday held that streedhan cannot become joint property of a couple, and a husband has no control over his wife’s assets, which he may use during times of distress but must return to her. Adjudicating a matrimonial dispute over streedhan, a bench of Justices Sanjiv Khanna and Dipankar Datta said a woman has absolute rights over her streedhan — gifts given to a woman before, during, or after marriage, such as money, jewellery, land, utensils and other gifts from parents, parents-in-law, relatives and friends.“It is her absolute property with all rights to dispose of at her own pleasure. The husband has no control over her streedhan. He may use it during times of his distress, but nonetheless, he has a moral obligation to restore the same or its value to his wife. Therefore, streedhan property does not become joint property of the wife and the husband, and the husband has no title or independent dominion over the property as its owner,” the bench stated.The court noted that a man or his family members could be prosecuted under Section 406 of IPC for criminal breach of trust if streedhan is dishonestly misappropriated.It also held that in such cases, the dispute should not be decided based on proof beyond reasonable doubt as in criminal cases, but on the preponderance of probabilities tending to draw an inference that the fact must be more probable.In this case, a woman alleged that her jewellery was taken away by her husband on the very first day of marriage, and she approached the family court to retrieve her property after the relationship turned sour and they decided to separate. A family court in 2009 passed a verdict in her favour and ordered her husband to pay her Rs 8.9 lakh, but the Kerala High Court quashed the order and held that the wife failed to prove that her stridhan was taken away by him.The court, after examining the evidence, concluded that the family court’s verdict was correct and directed that she be paid Rs 25 lakh, considering the passage of 15 years since the family court’s verdict. It said that the high court erred in doubting her bona fide for approaching the court late.","A woman has absolute rights over her streedhan - gifts given to a woman before, during, or after marriage.

He said the two phrases — ‘community resources’ and ‘public good’ — were intrinsically connected and no private property could be acquired through a law, seeking to advance the objectives of Article 39(b), unless it satisfied the ‘distribution for common good’ purpose.“The overarching and underlying principle governing distribution is furtherance of common good. For the achievement of this objective, Constitution uses the generic word ‘distribution’. Distribution has broad contours and cannot be limited to meaning only one method (eg auction). It envisages all such methods available for distribution/allocation of natural resources which ultimately subserve the ‘common good’,” he said.Though opposed to retributive acquisition of private property for distribution to subserve the ethos of directive principles, the AG said, “Law should be used as an instrument of distributive justice to achieve a fair division of wealth among members of society based upon the principle ‘from each according to his capacity, to each according to his needs’.“Distributive justice comprehends more than achieving lessening of inequalities by differential taxation, giving debt relief or distribution of property owned by one to many who have none by imposing a ceiling on holdings, both agricultural and urban.”",Attorney general R Venkataramani told SC on Thursday that government would never adopt the Marxist egalitarian policy of ‘rob Peter to pay Paul’ in achieving the ideals of distributing community resources for the common good.

NIA arrests UK resident for 2023 London high commission attack,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nia-arrests-uk-resident-for-2023-london-high-commission-attack/articleshow/109605143.cms,"NEW DELHI: National Investigation Agency ( NIA ) has arrested a key accused involved in last year’s violent attack on Indian high commission in London. The suspect — identified as Inderpal Singh Gaba , a resident of Hounslow in the United Kingdom — was arrested upon arrival in Delhi on the basis of a look-out circular issued against him earlier.The development is significant given the agency, in a first, has arrested a British resident for a crime that happened under the UK’s jurisdiction.“While the move affirms the growing coordination between law enforcement agencies of both countries, it is also being considered a major deterrent that will ensure there is no repeat of such breach of security, disrespect to the Indian flag or any threat to Indian interests abroad,” said a senior officer.NIA’s investigation in the case so far has revealed that the incidents in London on March 19 and 22, 2023, were parts of a larger conspiracy to unleash vicious attacks on Indian missions and its officials.The attacks were found to be in retaliation to the action taken by Punjab Police against pro-Khalistan separatist Amritpal Singh, who was arrested in March last year. Govt had taken strong objection to the developments and summoned the senior-most diplomat in UK high commission in London and demanded an explanation on the absence of security.The high commission was attacked by a group of 50 persons, who committed criminal trespass, disrespected the Indian flag, damaged public property and caused injuries to officials at the high commission.The attack was allegedly organised by Gurcharan Singh, Dal Khalsa, UK; Avtar Singh Khanda of KLF, Jasvir Singh and their associates, both Indian and foreign nationals, who were identified during the probe.An NIA team visited the UK in May 2023 to probe the attack. Subsequently, a crowdsourcing of information was also carried out to identify and collect information about the UK-based entities and individuals involved in the incident, based on which the agency identified many of the attackers. Around a dozen lookout circulars were issued, and a manhunt was initiated.Last August, NIA had raided 31 locations in Punjab and Haryana to “unravel and unearth full contours of the conspiracy” behind the March attack. In Oct, UK’s Metropolitan Police had arrested a suspect, whose identity was not revealed, and was later released on bail.NIA had earlier said it was leaving no stone unturned to pinpoint culpability in the London attack and arrest the perpetrators, their associates and their supporters, based in India and abroad. The raids had also led to the seizure of digital data containing information related to the accused persons involved in the attack.","Inderpal Singh Gaba was arrested upon arrival in Delhi on the basis of a look- out circular issued against him earlier.

Cong: Delay in holding census as govt wants to scrap SC/ST quota,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cong-delay-in-holding-census-as-govt-wants-to-scrap-sc/st-quota/articleshow/109603666.cms,"NEW DELHI: Expressing alarm at a three-year delay in conducting the 2021 decadal census, Congress on Thursday alleged Modi govt of wanting to scrap SC/ST reservations and said that is the intent behind the unprecedented postponement in holding the national headcount.Congress also accused PM Modi of lying, saying 'inheritance tax' is not on the party agenda and it was Rajiv Gandhi who ended the said tax in 1985, while BJP netas, led by Arun Jaitley and Jayant Sinha, had advocated it in Modi govt.Speaking to reporters, AICC spokesman Jairam Ramesh said PM Modi's policy is ""asatyamev jayate"", which is making him speak lies about Congress in his election speeches.Ramesh said besides key data about the population, the decennial census also collects SC/ST numbers. ""The population figures of SC/ST are important because our reservation policy is based on population. Why a three-year delay? Because BJP wants to end reservation and does not want to collect SC/ST data,"" he argued.The Congress spokesman said there is no excuse for a three-year delay in the census as many countries conducted their census even during Covid, adding that preparation for 2021 census would have started in 2020.At the same time, he said BJP has neither published the caste data collected under Socio-Economic Caste Census conducted by UPA govt, nor has it ordered a fresh SECC which should be done every ten years.On Modi's ""lies about wealth redistribution"" and ""inheritance tax"" and his ""communal"" tone, Ramesh said the PM wants to ""drag Congress to the pitch prepared by Jay Shah and others"", but Congress will stick to its positive agenda of jobs, economy, prices, saving Constitution and democracy, and social welfare.On PM Modi's allegation of Congress eyeing gold and ""mangalsutras"" of women, Ramesh said a Reserve Bank of India (RBI) report says that in past ten years, 1.5 crore families have pledged gold to take loans from banks, and if unorganised sector money lending is included, one out of four families have mortgaged gold for loans.""And this PM talks about mangalsutras and gold. A person who did not respect mangalsutra in his life is now expressing concern about mangalsutra,"" he said.","Congress accuses PM Modi of lying, saying 'inheritance tax' is not on the party agenda.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.",Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Ottawa meet to underline urgency for global plastic pollution treaty,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/ottawa-meet-to-underline-urgency-for-global-plastic-pollution-treaty/articleshow/109603554.cms,"OTTAWA: The fourth session of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee ( INC ) for developing an international legally binding instrument on plastic pollution, including in the marine environment, has embarked on a mission to propel the draft global treaty on plastic pollution closer to its final form.The urgency behind this endeavour stems from the imperative to curb plastic pollution and lay the groundwork for a sustainable future.As the committee convenes from April 23 to 29, 2024, in Ottawa, Canada, the global community is anticipating some significant strides towards this shared goal.The journey towards this occasion can be traced back to March 2022, during the resumed fifth session of UN Environment Assembly, where a resolution was adopted to develop an international legally binding instrument on plastic pollution. Since then, INC has pursued its mandate, fuelled by the ambition to conclude negotiations by the end of 2024.With each session, the momentum towards decisive action has intensified. The next session is at Busan, South Korea, this year after which heads of state will sign an agreement at a diplomatic conference.At the heart of the matter lies the exponential rise in plastic production, underpinned by a linear, resource-inefficient model. This take-make-waste approach has exacerbated the plastic pollution crisis, posing grave threats to human health, environmental integrity and climate stability. Alarming projections suggest a staggering 70% increase in plastic production by 2040 if current trends persist, further exacerbating the ecological burden. Moreover, the life cycle of plastic - from production to disposal - contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions, underscoring the interconnectedness ofenvironmental challenges .The journey towards a global plastic pollution treaty has not been without challenges. The formidable influence of pro-plastic lobbies, including the 'like-minded' countries and industry lobby, advocating for downstream interventions like extended producer responsibility (EPR) and recycling, has posed a formidable obstacle.However, there is hope as the invaluable contributions of indigenous communities and their traditional knowledge in fostering environmental stewardship has been widely acknowledged. Recognising the importance of intergenerational wisdom, efforts to preserve and transmit this knowledge to future generations have been underscored.Additionally, the pivotal role of informal actors, such as waste pickers, in urban waste management, was highlighted, emphasizing the importance of a just transition for these essential contributors in the global plastic pollution treaty. There is a growing recognition of the imperative to address the entire plastic life cycle, encompassing production, manufacturing and waste management, to stem the tide of pollution effectively.Where the treaty text will stand and how it will translate to local actions on the ground, only time will tell. This is a crucial week for all of us!(Swati Singh Sambyal is an international circular economy expert)","The fourth session of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee ( INC ) for developing an international legally binding instrument on plastic pollution.

Political survival amidst scandal

In a dramatic twist in Spanish politics, Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez has hinted at the possibility of resigning after a judicial investigation targeted his wife, Begoña Gómez , over allegations of influence peddling and corruption. The probe, initiated by a right-wing legal platform, has stirred significant controversy and debate across the nation.Earlier this Wednesday, Madrid's court announced the commencement of a preliminary investigation into accusations against Gómez.These allegations suggest she might have leveraged her position to sway business dealings to her benefit. The legal complaint, brought forward by the conservative group Manos Limpias, or ""Clean Hands,"" claims that Gómez secured undue advantages from Air Europa and its parent company Globalia during her tenure at an African research centre.Despite these severe charges, the Socialists' leader, who began his second term in November, voiced strong support for his wife, maintaining her innocence. ""Begoña will defend her honor and cooperate fully with the justice system to prove these seemingly scandalous facts are, in fact, nonexistent,"" Sánchez stated in a letter published on his X account.Sánchez described the attacks as profoundly unjust and harmful, necessitating a temporary withdrawal from his public duties to deliberate his political future. ""I need to stop and reflect,"" he wrote. ""Is it worth continuing amid this mire created by the right and far right in our politics? Should I remain at the government's helm or renounce that highest of honors?""This introspection comes at a crucial time, as Spain approaches important regional elections in Catalonia and subsequent European elections in June.Known affectionately as "" El Guapo "" (Mr Handsome), the 52-year-old has consistently demonstrated a propensity for taking bold risks that have often shifted political odds in his favor.In the previous year, facing a disappointing outcome in regional elections for his Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE), Sanchez initiated a snap election. Despite the Popular Party (PP) securing the most seats, they fell short of a majority, leading Sanchez to craft a contentious agreement with smaller regional factions. This deal, notably including an amnesty for those involved in Catalonia's 2017 bid for independence, has intensified the existing political divide and drawn sharp criticism toward Sanchez and his party from opposition figures and the judiciary alike.Sanchez, maintaining his characteristic secrecy, disclosed plans for the snap election to only a select few within his inner circle, taking many by surprise. Similarly, on Wednesday, he confided exclusively in his family and close friends about his contemplation of resignation, personally drafting the announcement without the aid of his staff, as sources revealed to Reuters.Should Sanchez decide to resign, the fragmented nature of parliament might complicate the selection of his successor, suggests Lluis Orriols, a political science professor at Carlos III University in Madrid. Orriols believes a general election would be a more probable outcome.In critique of Sanchez's potential resignation, Santiago Abascal, the leader of the far-right Vox party, commented, ""Sanchez should have benched himself long ago"" due to the controversy surrounding the Catalan amnesty. ""We don't know if this is another of his propaganda maneuvers to present himself as a poor victim,"" he added.Public opinion appears mixed, with some viewing Sanchez's possible resignation as a strategic move to garner media attention. Cristina, a 24-year-old consultant in Madrid, expressed skepticism: ""I think it's a way of attracting attention and getting the press to react, but the reality is that he's not going to resign,"" opting not to provide her surname.Sánchez, known for his resilience and political acumen, faces perhaps his most challenging period. The Socialist leader, once celebrated for his decisive actions and reforms, now contends with an atmosphere tainted by allegations and public skepticism.Spain has seen its share of political scandals, but the potential resignation of Sánchez, a figure who has weathered numerous political storms, marks a significant moment in its contemporary political history. As the nation waits for his decision on Monday, the coming days are crucial for both Sánchez's career and the broader Spanish political landscape.(With inputs from agencies)","Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez has hinted at the possibility of resigning.

First cargo ship passes through newly opened channel in Baltimore since bridge collapse,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/first-cargo-ship-passes-through-newly-opened-channel-in-baltimore-since-bridge-collapse/articleshow/109599605.cms,"BALTIMORE: The first cargo ship passed through a newly opened deep-water channel in Baltimore on Thursday after being stuck in the harbor since the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapsed four weeks ago.The Balsa 94, a bulk carrier sailing under a Panama flag, passed through the new 35-foot (12-meter) channel headed for St. John, Canada.The ship is one of five stranded vessels expected to pass through the new, temporary channel.On Thursday morning, the vessel moved through the channel guided by two tug boats, one in front and one behind. It passed slowly by the wreckage of the bridge and the Dali, the massive container ship that caused the collapse when it slammed into one of the bridge’s support columns.The Balsa 94 is expected to arrive in Canada on Monday.The new channel will remain open until Monday or Tuesday. It will then close again until roughly May 10 while crews work to remove steel from the Dali and refloat the ship, which will then be guided back into the port, officials said earlier this week.The 35-foot depth is a substantial increase over the three other temporary channels established in recent weeks. It puts the cleanup effort slightly ahead of schedule, as officials previously said they hoped to open a channel of that depth by the end of April.Five of the seven cargo ships that have been stuck in Baltimore’s harbor will be able to pass through the new channel, including one loaded car carrier, officials said. Other ships are scheduled to enter the port, which normally processes more cars and farm equipment than any other in the country.The port’s main channel, with a controlling depth of 50 feet (15 meters), is set to reopen next month after the ship has been removed. That will essentially restore marine traffic to normal.","The Balsa 94, a bulk carrier sailing under a Panama flag, passed through the new 35-foot (12-meter) channel headed for St. John, Canada.

Nasa's Hubble marks 34th anniversary with stunning view of Little Dumbbell Nebula,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/nasas-hubble-marks-34th-anniversary-with-stunning-view-of-little-dumbbell-nebula/articleshow/109594560.cms,"In celebration of its 34th anniversary, Nasa 's Hubble Space Telescope has once again wowed astronomers and space enthusiasts alike by capturing an extraordinary image of the Little Dumbbell Nebula . This latest image offers a vivid glimpse into the complexities of a planetary nebula , demonstrating Hubble's enduring capabilities in its extended mission.The Little Dumbbell Nebula, also known as Messier 76, is one of the faintest objects in the Messier catalog and has intrigued astronomers for its intricate structure and dual-lobed shape. This planetary nebula, located approximately 2,500 light-years away in the constellation Perseus, represents a brief stage in the life cycle of a moderate-sized star like our sun.Dr. Jennifer Wiseman , a senior scientist at Nasa's Goddard Space Flight Center, expressed her admiration for the new imagery: ""This beautiful nebula is what remains after a star like our own sun has exhausted the bulk of its nuclear fuel and shed its outer layers. The vibrant colors and intricate structures visible in the nebula are a telescope’s way of painting the portrait of the final stages of stellar evolution.""The Little Dumbbell Nebula, despite its faintness, shines brightly in the detailed images provided by Hubble, allowing scientists to study aspects of the nebula that are rarely visible. The images highlight the dense, glowing gas and complex layers of material expelled from the dying star at the center of the nebula.According to Dr. Wiseman, ""Hubble's high-resolution capabilities allow us to examine the fine details within the nebula, helping us understand how stars expel their material and the dynamics of this expulsion process. This image is more than just a picture; it's a deep dive into the life of stars.""Since its launch on April 24, 1990, Hubble has revolutionized our understanding of the universe, from the dynamics of galaxies to the atmospheres of exoplanets and the distribution of dark matter. Its contributions continue to support and complement data gathered by newer space observatories.As Hubble continues its journey in space, the scientific community remains enthusiastic about the ongoing contributions it will bring to our understanding of the cosmos. Dr. Wiseman remarked, ""Every image from Hubble is a new lesson in our cosmic curriculum.""These observations not only contribute significantly to our knowledge of the life cycle of stars but also continue to highlight the critical role of Hubble in the exploration and understanding of our universe. As Hubble enters another year in orbit, its legacy of discoveries promises to keep inspiring both the scientific community and the public.","The Little Dumbbell Nebula, also known as Messier 76, is one of the faintest objects in the Messier catalog.

"US births fell last year, marking an end to the late pandemic rebound, experts say",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-births-fell-last-year-marking-an-end-to-the-late-pandemic-rebound-experts-say/articleshow/109592717.cms,"NEW YORK: US births fell last year, resuming a long national slide. A little under 3.6 million babies were born in 2023 , according to provisional statistics released Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That's about 76,000 fewer than the year before and the lowest one-year tally since 1979.US births were slipping for more than a decade before COVID-19 hit, then dropped 4% from 2019 to 2020.They ticked up for two straight years after that, an increase experts attributed, in part, to pregnancies that couples had put off amid the pandemic's early days.But “the 2023 numbers seem to indicate that bump is over and we're back to the trends we were in before,” said Nicholas Mark, a University of Wisconsin researcher who studies how social policy and other factors influence health and fertility .Birth rates have long been falling for teenagers and younger women, but rising for women in their 30s and 40s — a reflection of women pursuing education and careers before trying to start families, experts say. But last year, birth rates fell for all women younger than 40, and were flat for women in their 40s.Mark called that development surprising and said “there's some evidence that not just postponement is going on.”Rates fell across almost all racial and ethnic groups.The numbers released Thursday are based on more than 99.9% of the birth certificates filed in 2023, but they are provisional and the final birth count can change as they are finalized. For example, the provisional 2022 birth count appeared to show a dip, but ended up being higher than 2021's tally when the analysis was completed.There could be an adjustment to the 2023 data, but it won't be enough to erase the “sizeable” decline seen in the provisional numbers, said the CDC's Brady Hamilton, the new report's first author.Experts have wondered how births might be affected by the June 2022 US Supreme Court decision that allowed states to ban or restrict abortion. Experts estimate that nearly half of pregnancies are unintended, so limits to abortion access could affect the number of births.The new report indicates that the decision didn't lead to a national increase in births, but the researchers didn't analyze birth trends in individual states or dissect data among all demographic groups.The new data does raise the possibility of an impact on teens. The US teen birth rate has been falling decades, but the decline has been less dramatic in recent years, and the drop seems to have stopped for teen girls ages 15 to 17.“That could be Dobbs,” said Dr. John Santelli, a Columbia University professor of population and family health and pediatrics. Or it could be related to changes in sex education or access to contraception, he added.Whatever the case, the flattening of birth rates for high school students is worrisome and indicates that “whatever we're doing for kids in middle and high school is faltering,” Santelli said.More findings from the report:—From 2022 to 2023, the provisional number of births fell 5% for American Indian and Alaska Native women, 4% for Black women, 3% for white women and 2% for Asian American women. Births rose 1% for Hispanic women.—The percentage of babies born preterm held about steady.—The cesarean section birth rate rose again, to 32.4% of births. Some experts worry that C-sections are done more often than medically necessary.—The US was once among only a few developed countries with a fertility rate that ensured each generation had enough children to replace itself — about 2.1 kids per woman. But it’s been sliding, and in 2023 dropped to about 1.6, the lowest rate on record.Surveys suggest many US couples would prefer to have two or more kids but see housing, job security and the cost of child care as significant obstacles to having more children.“There's something getting in the way of them being able to achieve those goals,” Mark said.","A little under 3.6 million babies were born in 2023, according to provisional statistics.

However, he acknowledged the challenges posed by stagflation, adding, ""That doesn't mean you can fight off the effects of stagflation, something like that, if it gets much worse.""Dimon characterized the current economic situation as nearing a ""soft landing"" scenario, although he remained cautious. This assessment comes as inflation has decreased from the 40-year highs of over 9% in the summer of 2022 to below 4% recently, but still remains above the Federal Reserve's 2% target.In response, the Federal Reserve has increased interest rates from nearly zero to over 5%, maintaining these levels to control inflation. Dimon cautioned about the wider consequences of these high rates, saying, ""If rates go up and you have a recession, that will hurt leveraged companies, jobs, profits, and real estate."" He emphasized the potential for a 'triple whammy' effect that could adversely impact banks.Regarding geopolitics, Dimon described the current global situation as the most complex and perilous since World War II, with significant tensions involving major powers and various conflicts worldwide. He warned that the global order faces challenges and risks descending into a state of mild chaos if it undergoes realignment. The current world order , he cautioned, is being ""challenged"" and could potentially devolve into disorder should a significant shift occur in the balance of power.Dimon noted that these situations could disrupt oil and gas prices, international trade, and military relationships, especially affecting poorer nations.Dimon also reaffirmed his skepticism about the cryptocurrency industry, differentiating between the practicality of blockchain technology and the less tangible benefits of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. ""Blockchain is real, we use it, but we've been talking about crypto for 10 years and not a whole lot has come of it,"" he commented, maintaining a critical perspective on the digital currencies sector.As the world navigates these economic and geopolitical uncertainties, Dimon's insights emphasize the need for prudent management and readiness for potential disruptions that could alter the global economic and political landscape.","JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon expressed a nuanced perspective on the global economy in a recent Bloomberg interview.

Islamabad, according to finance minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, could secure a staff-level agreement on the new programme by early July.Following the PM's brief address, the house was opened for a question and answer session where business leaders voiced their appreciation of the government’s recent moves but made more demands. They also shared proposals for economic measures to accomplish the intended goals and expressed concerns about political instability.“You have made a few handshakes after taking charge that have produced good results and progress on the IMF deal is one of them,” said Arif Habib, a top Pakistani entrepreneur. “I suggest you do a few more handshakes. One of them is regarding trade with India, which would greatly benefit our economy. Secondly, you should also patch up with a resident of Adiala Jail (a reference to jailed PTI leader Imran Khan). Try to fix things at that level as well, and I believe that you can do it.”The PM avoided responding directly to questions aimed at political stability, but claimed to have noted down his proposals for economic growth and assured him that he would soon invite businessmen from all across the country to Islamabad and sit with them “till all the issues aren’t resolved”.Pakistan had downgraded its ties and suspended trade relations with India after the Modi-led govt changed the special status of Jammu and Kashmir in August 2019. Since then, Pakistan has linked its decision to normalising ties with India with the restoration of the special status of the Himalayan region.However, Pakistan’s incumbent govt, with the tacit approval of the military establishment, has been trying to create an environment conducive for business and trade ties.",PM Shehbaz Sharif met with business leaders in Karachi on Wednesday.

The warning came after Russia's Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance (FSVPS) issued a notification regarding violations of international and Russian phytosanitary requirements over a shipment of rice imported from Pakistan.Dated April 2, the notification highlights the presence of a quarantine organism, ""Megaselia scalaris (Loew),"" in the rice consignment.Pakistan's trade representative at its embassy in Russia was asked to carry out an immediate investigation into the matter.The Russian authorities have written to the Pakistan embassy to prevent such violations and ensure all Pakistani rice exporters follow phytosanitary standards to ensure the safety of agricultural products traded between the two countries.The trade wing of the Pakistani embassy in Moscow, while forwarding the Russian authority's letter to the Department of Plant Protection (DPP) in the Ministry of Food Security and other relevant government offices, has warned of a possible ban on rice exports in future if more complaints were received from Russian authorities.Russia had previously imposed a ban on rice imports from Pakistan in 2019 because of health safety reasons.Similarly, in December 2006, Russia stopped the import of rice from Pakistan for not meeting food safety standards.Chairman of the Pakistan Rice Exporters Association, Chela Ram Kewlani, said that Pakistani rice exporters needed to be very careful in choosing and packaging all rice for export.He said that Pakistan had benefited from India banning exports of non-Basmati rice last year, given that India has a nearly 40 per cent share in the globally traded rice.Last year, India banned the export of white non-Basmati and parboiled rice.According to a leading Pakistani rice dealer, about 700,000 tonnes of rice were exported in December 2023 alone, the highest in a month for the fiscal year.He said Pakistan exported rice with an increase in higher production and demand and elevated global prices last year.The Rice Export Corporation is projecting a 60 per cent jump in exports of Basmati rice to over a million tonnes and a 36 per cent jump for non-Basmati rice to 4.25 million tonnes from Pakistan.It is eyeing exports of above five million metric tonnes of all rice in the fiscal year of 2023/2024, which would be much higher than last fiscal year's exports of 3.7 million tonnes.",Russia has warned Pakistan that it would ban rice imports again if Moscow's phytosanitary concerns are not addressed in future consignments.

These practices, which include stringent certification processes, opaque approval systems, and demands for abnormally low prices, have created significant barriers for European manufacturers seeking to compete in China, as reported by Euronews.According to reports, the EU's medical device industry has faced challenges due to China's ""Buy China"" policy, which prioritises domestically made products in public tenders. This policy shift has impacted leading exporters of medical appliances in Europe, including Germany, the Netherlands, and France, who produce a range of high-value medical devices.The probe, announced by the Commission, will investigate feedback from member states and businesses, engaging in dialogue with Chinese representatives over a period of up to nine months, with a potential extension of five months.""If the investigation confirms the existence of the suspected practices,"" stated the Commission, ""retaliatory measures on China could be considered to ensure fair competition."" These measures could include restrictions on Chinese companies' participation inpublic procurement across the EU, a market valued at over 2 trillion euros.Alternatively, the Commission may opt for more targeted measures, such as limiting prohibitions to tenders above a certain value or imposing conditions that disadvantage Chinese applicants.The European medtech industry has voiced concerns over the challenges posed by China's procurement policies. Medtech Europe, the trade association representing European medical technology industries, highlighted the importance of meaningful dialogue with China to address market access issues.""We hope that this investigation will lead to a meaningful dialogue with China and that the concerns highlighted in the investigation can be addressed through dialogue, eliminating the necessity of implementing (additional) measures in the EU procurement market,"" a spokesperson of Medtech Europe said in a statement.China remains a significant trading partner for medical equipment in Europe, accounting for 11 per cent of the market's export destinations in 2022, according to the trade association.The probe marks the first application of the International Procurement Instrument (IPI), a legislative tool aimed at addressing unfair competition faced by the EU from countries like China.China's heavily centralised economy has drawn criticism from Western allies for employing various tools to favour domestic companies over foreign competitors. This has led to increased tensions and prompted collective efforts to protect against perceived economic threats, according to Euronews.In addition to the probe into medical devices, the Commission has conducted unannounced inspections at the offices of a Chinese company in Poland and the Netherlands under the Foreign Subsidies Regulation. These actions follow investigations into Chinese producers of wind turbines and solar panels suspected of benefiting from state subsidies .Furthermore, the Commission is nearing completion of an inquiry into China-made electric vehicles, which could result in increased tariffs to counter the advantage gained from state subsidies.""China is for us simultaneously a partner, an economic competitor, and a systemic rival. And the last two dimensions are increasingly converging,"" Margrethe Vestager, the European Commission's executive vice president, said earlier this month.While European capitals have generally supported these initiatives as necessary safeguards for the single market, Beijing has criticised them as protectionist measures.""We urge the EU to adhere to its commitment to the open market and the principle of fair competition, abide by WTO rules, and stop unwarrantedly suppressing and restricting Chinese companies on various pretexts,"" Wang Wenbin, the spokesperson of China's Foreign Ministry, said on Wednesday.""We urge relevant parties to stop making groundless accusations and slandering China,"" Wenbin added, Euronews reported.","European Commission launches inquiry against China for allegedly favouring its domestic companies in tenders for medical devices.
