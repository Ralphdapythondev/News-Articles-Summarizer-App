TDS Deposition - TDS deducted as above should be deposited to the government treasury within 7 days from the end of the month in which such tax is deducted. In case the taxes are deducted in the month of March then TDS is required to be deposited on or before 30th April.

Practically, the concerned Registrar while registering the sale deed of the property may sometimes verify the TDS deducted on the sale of property, hence one needs to have the TDS deposited before proceeding with execution of the sale deed.

Filing of TDS Return – Buyer is required to file quarterly withholding tax Return (in Form 27Q) within the prescribed timelines [i.e., On or before 31st of the month immediately succeeding the quarter in which TDS is deducted. In the case of the last quarter (Jan-March), the due date is 31st May].

Certificate for Lower or Nil deduction of tax

The author is National Leader, Global Mobility Services – Tax, KPMG in India

With the robust growth in the Indian real estate market there is enhanced interest to own a residential property and benefit from increasing property prices or to simply earn passive incomes.If you are among those individuals who are involved in a property transaction (either as a buyer or a non-resident seller) where the seller of the property is a NR, then it would be imperative for you to be aware of the compliance provisions relating to Tax deduction at source (‘TDS’).First and foremost, it will be pertinent for the buyer of the property to ascertain whether the seller is a NR or not as per the specific provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (‘the IT Act’). This can be done by requesting stay details of the seller in India for the relevant financial year (‘FY’).This article focuses on TDS compliances which need to be complied with by a buyer while buying a property in India from a NR taxpayer.As per the provisions of the IT Act, person responsible for making payment to a NR, any sum chargeable to tax, is required to deduct appropriate TDS at the time of such payment. Accordingly, buyer of the property is required to comply with the following:The buyer of the property is required to deduct TDS at the time of making payment to the NR seller at the following prescribed rates:Technically speaking the buyer of the property is required to deduct TDS on the income element (i.e. computed capital gains) and hence is required to review the quantum of the taxable capital gain income. Considering the practical difficulties associated for the buyer to verify all of this (as the seller may claim capital gains exemption basis proposed re-investment in another property, actual computation may result in loss due to cost of acquisition/ improvements, Tax treaty benefits etc.), as a prevalent market practice TDS is deducted at the aforesaid rates on the total sale consideration.The same may significantly impact the cash flow of the NR seller as a portion of the sale consideration gets blocked in the form of TDS, which can only be claimed as offset against the advance tax/ self-assessment tax liability (if any) against the other income of the NR seller or as a refund (if applicable) in the India tax return for such year.To provide clarity for the buyer and ease the TDS burden for the seller, there are prescribed provisions under the Act wherein the income-tax officer can issue a lower / nil TDS certificate basis the specific facts of the case.As per the provisions of the IT Act, either the buyer or seller of the property, may file an application for obtaining a certificate for lower or nil deduction of tax along with prescribed documents and information. Upon receipt of such certificate, the buyer is required to deduct TDS at the rates prescribed in the certificate only. Process of obtaining certificate needs some time, hence you should appropriately factor the same in the agreed payment terms / completion of transaction.In a summary, either if as an NR you are selling a property in India or as a buyer you are purchasing a property from an NR, you need to be mindful of TDS compliances and related issues, to ensure a smooth transaction and correct compliances.Also, if the NR seller intends to remit money outside India, he/ she would need to evaluate the provisions of Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 (‘FEMA’) in terms of permissibility as well as take note of other prescribed compliances such as filing of Form 15CA, 15CB, etc., as may be applicable at the time of making the remittance.","This article focuses on TDS compliances which need to be complied with by a buyer while buying a property in India from a NR taxpayer.

Mumbai: Former Citigroup CEO Vikram Pandit is set to exit the real estate financing business established by veteran dealmaker Nimesh Kampani .INH Mauritius , an investment fund managed by Pandit, will sell 49% in JM Financial Credit Solutions (JMFCS) — the realty financing business — to Kampani’s JM Financial in a deal valued at about Rs 3,000 crore.Pandit will subsequently step down from the chairman’s position of the mid-tier NBFC.The move will increase JM Financial’s stake in JMFCS to 96% from 47%. The balance 4% is held by Moraine Master Fund and Aparna Aiyar, the wife of Pandit’s business partner Hariharan Aiyar. Hariharan too will step down from the board of JMFCS following the change in shareholding. JM Financial, which has been restricted from managing debt issues as well as offering loans against shares by regulators due to governance lapses, will buy 43% from INH Mauritius for Rs 1,282 crore in the first phase of the transaction. It will finance the deal through internal accruals which stands at over Rs 4,000 crore.INH is exiting JMFCS as the fund’s life is getting over, sources said. It first bought into JMFCS in fiscal 2015 and later acquired more shares in 2017 and then again in 2018, investing a total of Rs 950 crore in the NBFC. JMFCS marked Pandit’s first investment in India’s financial services sector. Pandit also holds 1.2% in the listed JM Financial. The deal valuation of Rs 3,000 crore is lower than JMFCS’ net worth of Rs 4,200 crore. This is because there has been under-recoveries in real estate financing and the same hasn’t been provided in the books. The under-recoveries are a result of stress on developers, said sources.Separately, JMFCS will buy 72% in an asset reconstruction company from JM Financial for Rs 856 crore. The move will increase JMFCS’ stake in JMFARC to 82% from 10%.The balance 18% is held by Ambuja Cements founder Narotam Sekhsaria (9%), Valiant Mauritius Partners and Indian Overseas Bank. The step is being taken as JM Financial Asset Reconstruction (JMFARC) needs funding on a regular basis as it has been under stress because of certain investments. Moreover, JMFCS, with a cash reserve of Rs 1,300 crore, is in a much better position to support JMFARC.","Ex-Citi chief Vikram Pandit to exit Kampani's fin biz in Rs 3k crore deal.

Budget 2024 expectations : As Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman prepares to present the Union Budget this month, the Modi 3.0 government aims to bolster the Indian economy with a keen focus on infrastructure. A critical component of this infrastructure is the power sector, where power exchanges can play a transformative role in enhancing efficiency, transparency, and competitive price discovery.Power exchanges are pivotal in India's power sector, offering over 25 contracts across various market segments and trading more than 120 billion units (BUs) annually. Despite this, power exchanges account for only about 7% of the country's total power generation, a stark contrast to European countries where over 50% of generation is traded through exchanges. This discrepancy underscores the significant growth potential for India's power exchanges.Recognizing the importance of a robust power market, the government’s Draft National Electricity Policy aims to increase the share of spot markets to 25% by 2030. This policy aligns with India's commitment to reducing the emission intensity of its GDP by 45% from 2005 levels and achieving net-zero emissions by 2070. To support these goals, the government plans to have 50% of installed generation capacity from non-fossil sources by 2030, necessitating around 500 GW ofrenewable energy (RE) capacity.The integration of renewable energy (RE) into India's grid can be significantly accelerated through power exchanges. Renewable sources often exhibit variability and intermittent generation, posing challenges for forecasting. Power exchanges offer solutions such as the Day Ahead Market (DAM) and Real Time Market (RTM), which provide flexible trading options to manage these fluctuations effectively.International examples illustrate how power exchanges can reduce renewable integration costs and offer efficient price signals. A Deloitte study highlights that market-based RE projects can achieve higher internal rates of return (IRR) compared to Power Purchase Agreement (PPA)-based projects. This approach addresses issues like signing delays, timely payments, and avoiding disputes.The Ministry of Power’s report on the ""Development of Electricity Market in India"" also advocates for a larger role for power exchanges, citing the inefficiencies of long-term PPAs. The report suggests models such as Contracts for Difference (CfD) and Virtual PPAs, which have been successful in countries like the UK and Germany.The future of renewable energy integration hinges on grid-level energy storage. Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) are poised to drive sector growth, offering cost-effective 24/7 renewable power. Recent tenders have shown significant tariff reductions, making BESS a promising solution for rapid decarbonization.The establishment of a Capacity Market is a key anticipated change, aimed at bridging power generation with national demand and determining optimal energy mixes. Additionally, the government's push for Green Hydrogen and Rooftop Solar projects is setting the stage for Peer-to-Peer (P2P) trading, which will revolutionize power consumption in India.Power exchanges have consistently delivered lower prices compared to other procurement methods over the past 15 years. As India advances towards energy banking solutions, energy storage, and green hydrogen, new products on power exchanges will be crucial in meeting the country's future energy demands. The Union Budget 2024 presents a pivotal opportunity to harness the potential of power exchanges, driving India towards a sustainable and efficient energy future.",Power exchanges offer over 25 contracts across various market segments and trading more than 120 billion units (BUs) annually. Power exchanges account for only about 7% of the country's total power generation.

Budget 2024 expectations : As India strives to attain developed nation status, the healthcare sector stands as a crucial component, underpinning the nation's aims for inclusive growth, sustainable development, and a bright future for its citizens. Over the past decade, India has made notable progress in healthcare, with significant advancements in infrastructure, technology, and accessibility.While the government has undertaken numerous vital reforms for the healthcare sector, the industry stakeholders have high expectations from the new government on the healthcare needs of the nation, especially regarding public health spending , which is anticipated to increase to 2.5% of GDP by 2025, aligning with the National Health Policy 2017 . To enhance healthcare infrastructure, there's a need to realign financing schemes to meet sector needs, ensuring a minimum lending period of 10 years. This should cover medical colleges and their academic and hospital wings, including nursing and allied healthcare.Standardization in clinical practice through robust implementation of Standard Treatment Guidelines across all states is essential. For tackling NCDs like Cancer, a nodal agency should be set up for cancer care that will consolidate and simplify various programs and regulations currently under various departments and include innovative screening technologies (AI/non-AI) for early detection of diseases in the national program guidelines.We need to strengthen Ayushman Bharat - Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB-PMJAY) and expand the limit to 10 lakhs for all covered population and 15 lakh for specific diseases like organ transplant, oncology treatment etc. Additionally, a scientific costing study for various treatments under AB-PMJAY is necessary to determine sustainable reimbursement rates, encouraging private healthcare providers to participate and help expand the scheme to senior citizens (70 years & above), as announced by the government, and the underserved. Viable package rates are crucial so that existing secondary and tertiary care private hospitals join the scheme and newer hospitals can be built to meet the increased number of patients who would avail the scheme.Augmenting and strengthening the healthcare workforce is also critical for the Indian healthcare sector. An 'Empowered Group on National Healthcare Workforce' should be established, providing a multi-stakeholder platform to develop a comprehensive strategy for workforce development. A national-level registry for all types of healthcare workers that will serve as a tool to help Central and state governments’ plan for upskilling and interventions for equitable distribution of the workforce can be created. We also need to construct an epidemiologic ‘needs-based’ model for healthcare workforce planning that considers the health needs of the population, disease burden, population growth, healthcare delivery infrastructure, and other critical parameters. Such a model could use demographic population projections to estimate the number of nurses and physicians required to provide this core set of services in 2047.For ease of doing business, we need to reduce the compliance burden by establishing a Single Window Clearance System for the health services sector for investors and companies. Currently 55+ licenses are required, with multiple portals in different states asking for similar data requirements along with multiple application and payment processes. There are 179 Laws, Regulations, Rules and Guidelines applicable to healthcare organisations. Implementation of the Clinical Establishment Act should be uniform for all states.Further, it is important to allow hospitals and healthcare facilities to avail input tax credit (ITC), under the GST regime, so that the credit chain is enabled for the health services sector. Currently the healthcare facilities are unable to avail ITC leading to higher cost of services to patients.","The healthcare sector stands as a crucial component, underpinning the nation's aims for inclusive growth, sustainable development, and a bright future for its citizens. Over the past decade, India has made notable progress in healthcare, with significant advancements in infrastructure, technology, and accessibility. The industry stakeholders have high expectations from the new government on the healthcare needs of the nation.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111612313,imgsize-109368,width-400,resizemode-4/111612313.jpg"

Additionally, the setting-off of losses against profits and carrying over the loss for up to the next eight years makes the opportunity cost of such alternative investments quite lucrative,"" the report said. It added that govt should tweak the tax on deposit interest and implement a flat tax treatment across the maturity ladder.The report comes at a time when the IDBI Bank sale process is stuck because of RBI not granting 'fit and proper' recognition to any bidder.

Budget 2024 expectations : With an aim to enhance healthcare accessibility, the Modi government is actively pursuing plans to double the reach of its flagship Ayushman Bharat health insurance scheme over the next three years.According to a PTI report, discussions are intensifying to increase the annual insurance coverage under the Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB-PMJAY) from the current Rs 5 lakh to Rs 10 lakh per family - a step that may be announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman in the Union Budget 2024 .The expansion of AB-PMJAY would likely begin by covering all individuals aged 70 years and above, potentially extending comprehensive health coverage to more than two-thirds of India's population. This expansion is expected to add approximately 4 to 5 crore new beneficiaries to the program, significantly enhancing healthcare access for senior citizens across the country.This enhancement is crucial to alleviate financial burdens associated with costly medical treatments like organ transplants and cancer therapies, addressing a critical factor contributing to family indebtedness due to healthcare expenses.Also Read | Budget 2024 income tax expectations: Top 10 things FM Sitharaman should do for salaried taxpayers According to estimates by the National Health Authority, implementing these proposals would necessitate an additional annual expenditure of Rs 12,076 crore for the exchequer. The impending Union Budget, scheduled for later this month, is expected to unveil substantial allocations towards more of these healthcare initiatives.In the interim Budget 2024, the government had already allocated Rs 7,200 crore for AB-PMJAY, making it the largest healthcare scheme worldwide, providing secondary and tertiary care hospitalisation coverage to 12 crore families.

MUMBAI: The long-term capital gains tax provisions are not fair to certain taxpayers, and this requires an amendment in the upcoming Budget 2024 . Income-tax (I-T) is a progressive tax mechanism, the more you earn the more you pay. Understandably, the very rich, having a taxable income of over Rs 5 crore pay tax at the rate of 42.74 per cent , whereas those having a taxable income of Rs 5 lakh or less fall in the ‘nil’ tax bracket.The latter stand to benefit because of a rebate mechanism, that was introduced by the interim budget of 2019.A rebate is a deduction from the I-T payable and section 87A of the I-T Act allows for a full rebate from tax for an individual having income up to Rs. 5 lakh subject to an upper cap of Rs. 12,500. Thus, while the basic exemption limit is Rs. 2.5 lakh under the old regime and Rs. 3 Lakhs in the new regime owing to the rebate an individual with an income of up to Rs. 5 lakh and up to Rs. 7 lakh under the old and new regime respectively, do not have to pay tax.In fact, if the taxpayer under old regime takes the full benefit of Rs. 1.50 lakh available as a deduction for various investments made during the year (such as public provident fund, repayment of housing loan, LIC Premium, tax saving mutual funds), a gross income of up to Rs. 6.50 lakh may not attract any I-T at all. In addition, if such taxpayer is salaried, the standard deduction of Rs. 50,000 would ensure that a gross income of up to Rs. 7 lakh may not attract any tax. (Refer Case 1).However, the same taxpayer can be in for a rude shock if he has earned long-term capital gains, for which a ‘concessional’ rate of tax at 20 per cent is prescribed under section 112. For instance, long-term capital gains arising on sale/transfer of debt mutual funds, unlisted equity shares, immovable property are taxed under this section at 20 percent, with indexation benefit.Also Read | Budget 2024: Top 3 steps Modi government should consider for employment generation “While the concessional tax rate under section 112 can be an advantage for an individual in the higher tax brackets, it works to a great disadvantage for an individual who is having his/her taxable income, including long term capital gains, at less than Rs. 5 lakh. Under the new regime this disadvantage will continue for a person having income less than Rs. 12 Lakhs,” explains Ketan Vajani, chartered accountant.Vajani goes on to illustrate: An individual, offering his income under old regime, has sold his residential house and has earned a long-term capital gain of Rs. 4 lakh. His other income, during this particular financial year is just Rs. 75,000, which takes his total income to Rs. 4.75 lakh. As per the rational of section 87A, his tax liability should be nil.Unfortunately, he will end up paying a tax of Rs. 32,500. Here is how (Refer Case 2).“Even after getting rebate a rebate of Rs. 12,500, this individual will end up paying Rs. 32,500 as basic tax, plus a cess of Rs. 1,300 bringing his total tax liability to Rs. 33,800. In short – he is paying tax even if his total income is less than Rs. 5 lakh,” explains Vajani.Also Read | Budget 2024: 7 structural reforms FM Nirmala Sitharaman should target for sustainable growth Under the new regime, the tax rate of 20 per cent is provided beyond the income level of Rs. 12 Lakhs and accordingly the disadvantage will continue to the taxpayers having income up to 12 Lakhs, beyond which the calculations will be tax neutral.The Chamber of Tax Consultants had in the past represented that considering the inequity that is created, section 112 should be amended. Tax on long term capital gains should be charged at 5 per cent (instead of 20 per cent), in cases where the total income, including such long-term capital gain is more than the basic exemption limit of Rs. 2.5 lakh but less than Rs. 5 lakh or 7 lakh (for the new regime). Now with the optional tax regimes in place, the need for such an amendment is even more acute.","The long-term capital gains tax provisions are not fair to certain taxpayers, and this requires an amendment in the upcoming Budget 2024.

Interest for a three-month period:

Need for increase in threshold limit :

MUMBAI: The Income-tax (I-T) Act prescribes for payment of advance taxes if a taxpayer’s liability is more than Rs. 10,000. Section 234C provisions which entail payment of interest for an entire three-month period, till the next instalment date is unfair, especially for certain sections of individuals – like gig workers . Will Budget 2024 usher in a suitable amendment?Salaried individuals can disclose their total income (including the non-salary portion, such as bank interest, rent etc) to their employer, who then accordingly deducts tax at source, each month.If not, they must ensure advance taxes are duly paid as the tax deducted at source by the employer would not cover the entire tax liability . Non-salaried, have to meticulously compute and pay their own advance taxes.This is how it is done: Estimate the total income during the financial year. Reduce all eligible exemptions and deductions, based on the tax regime you have opted for. Further, reduce the tax deducted at source, or collected at source. Compute your estimated tax. If the amount of tax is more than Rs. 10,000 advance tax obligations apply.Small taxpayers who have opted for presumptive taxation scheme u/s 44AD (businessmen) and 44ADA (professionals such as doctors, lawyers) can pay their entire advance tax in one instalment by March 15. Further, senior citizens are not required to pay advance tax, if they do not earn any income from business or profession.Also Read | Budget 2024 income tax expectations: Top 10 things FM Sitharaman should do for salaried taxpayers The first instalment falls due within 75 days from the commencement of the new financial year. Those who do not have a steady salaried income (such as gig workers who have not opted for or are not eligible for presumptive taxation) find it challenging to gauge their income for the entire year at the very onset.Several individuals who moonlight – hold a job, but take up a small assignment here and there – for experience as well as additional income, tend to not opt for the presumptive tax scheme where 50% of the gross revenue has to be offered to tax.Capital gains that may arise on future sale of assets also cannot be predicted – this should be covered in the immutably following advance tax instalment.Sandeep Jhunjhunwala, partner, Nangia Andersen LLP says, “The exponential growth of income opportunities, especially for freelancers in the gig economy and new entrepreneurs, makes it exceedingly challenging to accurately predict annual income during the initial months of the financial year.”Also Read | Budget 2024 income tax expectations: Why 50% HRA exemption should include cities like Bengaluru, Hyderabad For their default, taxpayers have to bear interest under section 234C of one per cent per month, until the next instalment which falls due after three months. Even if there is an oversight and a default of one day, the interest payment is for the entire three months.To illustrate: Mr. A ought to have paid advance tax of Rs. 15,000 by June 15. However, he paid only Rs. 5,000. The shortfall is Rs. 10,000. Interest under section 234C will be Rs. 300 (which is @1% for three months).Jhunjhunwala states: “The challenge is further compounded by the stringent interest penalty structure. Even a one-day delay in any of the first three quarterly instalments results in a substantial 3% interest charge for the delayed quarter. Ideally, a more nuanced approach should be implemented. For example, if the June 15 instalment is paid by July 14, a lower interest rate of perhaps 1% could be applied instead of the punitive 3%. This would provide taxpayers with a small buffer period and alleviate the burden of unforeseen delays.”Earlier, the Bombay Chartered Accountants’ Society (BCAS) had in their pre-budget memorandum pointed out that the threshold limit of Rs. 10,000 was last amended by the Finance Act, 2009. Considering inflation, there is a need to increase this limit to a more realistic figure. Further, the requirement to pay advance tax in four instalments (which was only for corporate entities) was introduced for non-corporate taxpayers, by the 2016 budget. The law must be suitably amended to ensure that this requirement is removed for individuals.Prior to this amendment, the three due dates for payment of advance taxes were: September 15 (30% of the tax liability); December 15 (60% of the tax liability) and March 15 (100% of tax liability).Also Read | Budget 2024: 7 structural reforms FM Nirmala Sitharaman should target for sustainable growth “To streamline tax compliance and truly incentivise participation in this evolving economic ecosystem, broader relaxations from advance tax provisions for specific taxpayer categories are warranted. This could include freelancers, whose income is closely tied to project availability and market fluctuations, making income estimation highly improbable.Additionally, early retirees below the age of 60 years, who often generate income from various sources other than PGBP, could also benefit from such relaxation.” “Further, simplifying the current advance tax framework and potentially deferring advance tax liability for the first two quarters (Q1 and Q2) for individuals and new entrepreneurs merits serious consideration.This would alleviate the burden of early and potentially inaccurate income estimation, enhance cash flow management for nascent businesses, and ultimately foster a more supportive environment for taxpayers,” suggests Jhunjhunwala.","The Income-tax (I-T) Act prescribes for payment of advance taxes if a taxpayer’s liability is more than Rs. 10,000.

That was enough for police to trace Shah's location and arrest him from a hotel in Virar in the afternoon, almost 60 hours after he rammed a two-wheeler and killed a woman, Kaveri Nakhwa (45).A Sena functionary's son, Mihir, his mother and two sisters had been on the run from Sunday morning and their mobile phones were switched off. Police, however, had tracked down numbers he called regularly and shortlisted a few friends. Their phones too were switched off, but one of the numbers was suddenly switched on Tuesday morning, resulting in the arrest. The friend, whose identity is unclear, has been detained for questioning. Mihir's mother and two sisters were detained by the crime branch from a resort.Mihir's mother and two sisters were detained by the crime branch unit 3 as police said they were shielding him. The mother and sisters were found by police to be staying in a resort in Shahapur.Mihir will be produced before a metropolitan magistrate's court in Sewri on Wednesday. Police said he was to be sent for a medical test on Tuesday.Police had on Sunday arrested Mihir's father Rajesh Shah, a Shinde-led Shiv Sena functionary , and the family driver, Rishiraj Bidawat (30), who was in the car at the time of the accident. While Shah was granted bail on Monday, a court in Sewri on Tuesday extended Bidawat's police custody by two days.Chilling details of the hit-and-run had come to light on Monday when the public prosecutor revealed how victim Kaveri Nakhwa was first dragged for 1.5 km and then run over when the driver took over from Mihir at the steering wheel and momentarily reversed the vehicle.Police sources said after Mihir Shah ran away from the accident spot near the Worli end of the sea link on Sunday, his car got stalled at Kala Nagar in Bandra. While Bidawat then stayed back near the car, Mihir took an autorickshaw and went to his girlfriend's house in Goregaon, police said.A cop said, ""Mihir's eyes were swollen, and he told his girlfriend about the accident. She then called up Mihir's sister, who arrived there and took Mihir with her to their Borivli residence.""From there, Mihir along with his two sisters, mother and a friend, left home. They travelled in two vehicles, including their family car, said police. The family had switched off their mobile phones and their house was also locked. At this point, police checked the mobile phones of some of Mihir's friends but those too had been switched off.During probe, police said, they found that after leaving the city, Mihir, his family and a friend stayed at a resort in Shahapur. On Monday night, Mihir and his friend left Shahapur and went to a hotel in Virar.Initially, police and crime branch got a tip-off that Rajesh Shah's other driver, Mohammed Hassan, was accompanying the family members who were on the run.On Tuesday, Mihir's friend came out of the Virar hotel, walked some distance and switched on his phone. ""We began tracing the location and found its location in Virar,"" said the cop. Police team immediately went to Virar, checked the mobile tower location and with the help of CCTV footage tracked the person operating the phone to the hotel where they found Mihir.""What Mihir was doing in Virar, who was helping him, all this needs to be probed. We will be producing him in court on Wednesday. We are also questioning the family members (mother and sisters)."" Police sources said Mihir's friends had given contradictory statements about whether he had consumed alcohol at a Juhu bar on Saturday night.","After fleeing city, BMW case accused, kin stayed at resort in Shahapur.

The retreat's agenda

This week marks the beginning of the “annual fly-in event” at Friedman Memorial Airport in Hailey, Idaho, colloquially known as the “summer camp for billionaires .” Hosted by the New York investment bank Allen & Company, the exclusive Sun Valley retreat attracts some of the richest and most powerful leaders in business, media, and politics.As per a CNN report, the gathering, scheduled from July 9-13, brings together high-profile guests in a relaxed, trail-dad chic atmosphere.Participants, clad in puffy Patagonia vests and Apple watches, engage in off-the-record discussions and enjoy organized adventures such as hiking and rafting.Sun Valley has a reputation for being the birthplace of significant business deals. It is widely believed that Jeff Bezos decided to buy The Washington Post at this retreat, and Comcast's acquisition of NBC Universal was also reportedly conceived here. Warren Buffett famously referred to Sun Valley dealmaking as “acquisitions by walking around.”The Idaho Mountain Express and Variety have reported a parade of private jets arriving on Tuesday, July 9, carrying dozens of power brokers including:Other prominent names from the tech and business sector expected to attend are Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Andy Jassy, Peter Thiel, Daniel Ek, Neal Mohan, Michael J Cavanagh, Dara Khosrowshahi, Brian Chesky, Mike Fries, Barry Diller, Alex Karp, Ynon Kreiz, and Marc Benioff.From the entertainment and fashion world, notable attendees include Shari Redstone, Jason Blum, Brian Grazer, Bobby Kotick, Charles Rivkin, Bryan Lourd, François-Henri Pinault, Sara Blakely, Michael Rapino, Anthony Wood, and Netflix co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters.Political figures expected to attend include Michael Bloomberg, Chuck Schumer, Amos Yadlin, Kyrsten Sinema, Wes Moore, Brad Little, Mark Gordon, Gretchen Whitmer, and Josh Shapiro.Media representatives attending are Gayle King, David Begnaud, Anderson Cooper, Erin Burnett, Elle Duncan, Becky Quick, Tom Friedman, Andrew Ross Sorkin, and Evan Osnos.The retreat's agenda is kept secret, and attendees engage in closed-door lectures on topics ranging from national security to healthcare. Despite the secrecy, there is anticipation of discussions around artificial intelligence, Bob Iger’s succession plan, and the Paramount-Skydance merger.One notable absence this year is Warren Buffett, who at nearly 94, is possibly handing over the reins to his successor, Greg Abel. Elon Musk is also absent, following last year's public fallout with other CEOs.As the elite gather to discuss the future, questions about President Joe Biden’s ability to campaign loom large, with potential 2024 ballot replacements being a hot topic. Governors Gretchen Whitmer, Josh Shapiro, and Wes Moore are seen as potential contenders.","This week marks the beginning of the “annual fly-in event” at Friedman Memorial Airport in Hailey, Idaho.

Otherwise, they will face tariffs of 25 percent.Under Biden's latest proclamation, aluminum imports from Mexico that contain primary aluminum smelt or were cast in China, Belarus, Iran or Russia will also face a 10 percent tariff.Mexico will require importers to provide information about the products' countries of origin.""These actions fix a major loophole that the previous administration failed to address, and that countries like China use to avoid US tariffs by shipping their products through Mexico,"" Brainard said.She charged that ""Chinese steel and aluminum entering the US market through Mexico evades tariffs, undermines our investments and harms American workers in states like Pennsylvania and Ohio.""As Biden's reelection bid enters a critical stage, the president has been working to win over voters in swing states including Pennsylvania.A senior US official conceded that the latest measures are ""forward-looking.""Nearly 90 percent of some 3.8 million tons of steel imports from Mexico is already melted and poured in either the United States, Canada or Mexico, an official said on condition of anonymity.The remaining comes from a number of countries including China, the official added without giving further details.Similarly, of the 105,000 metric tons of aluminum from Mexico, 94 percent was smelted or cast in the same three North American countries.But officials maintained that China was producing well above domestic demand, warning that ""a lot of the excess capacity is bound to be exported abroad.""""These joint actions with Mexico will help to ensure the long-term viability of our steel and aluminum industries,"" said US Trade Representative Katherine Tai.In May, the United States announced steep tariff hikes on Chinese imports like electric vehicles and semiconductors, as Biden warned that Washington would not let China flood the US market.But tariffs on sectors like EVs were considered pre-emptive, since few such cars are imported.","U.S. moves to prevent China-origin goods from avoiding tariffs.

Jerome Powell: More good inflation data would boost Fed confidence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/jerome-powell-more-good-inflation-data-would-boost-fed-confidence/articleshow/111612325.cms,"Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said “more good data” would strengthen confidence that inflation is moving down toward the US central bank’s 2% target, and recent readings point to “modest further progress” on prices.In testimony prepared for a Senate hearing Tuesday, Powell warned that lowering interest rates too little or too late could put the economy and the labor market at risk.“Elevated inflation is not the only risk we face,” he told lawmakers on the first of two days of congressional testimony. “Reducing policy restraint too late or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment.”The Fed chair also said cutting rates too soon or too much could stall or reverse inflation progress.“More good data would strengthen our confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2%,” Powell told the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs in prepared remarks. He testifies Wednesday before the House Financial Services Committee.US central bankers are aiming to bring inflation back to the 2% goal following a post-pandemic surge in prices. While the labor market has held up under pressure from higher interest rates, an uptick in the unemployment rate has added political pressure on Fed officials to start reducing borrowing costs.Powell’s remarks suggest the Federal Open Market Committee is unlikely to reduce rates when it meets at the end of this month.Treasury yields oscillated but were higher on the day and the S&P 500 index remained higher after Powell’s testimony was released.Traders are pricing in a just over 70% probability that the Fed first cuts rates in September. They see two quarter-point rate reductions in 2024.Fed officials have welcomed recent data indicating inflation is decelerating again following a jump in prices at the start of the year, though several other policymakers have also said they need more confidence that the trend will continue before reducing borrowing costs.The Fed’s preferred inflation measure rose 2.6% in the 12 months through May, down from 7.1% in June 2022. While unemployment remains low at 4.1%, it has ticked up in each of the last three months.A number of economists are warning that there’s a slowdown afoot in the job market that could worsen. The number of people who have been looking for a job for 15 weeks or more rose in June to the highest level since early 2022, when that measure was rapidly declining.Powell called the labor market “strong, but not overheated,” adding that the central bank’s restrictive stance is working to bring supply and demand into better balance.“Another increase in the jobless rate in the July report could challenge our base case of one rate cut this year in December, raising the possibility of two cuts starting in September,” said Yelena Shulyatyeva, senior economist at BNP Paribas.The Fed has held its policy rate at what it describes as a restrictive level of 5.25% to 5.5% for a year. Futures traders have almost fully priced in a cut for the Sept 17-18 policy meeting, less than two months before the US election.","Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell testifies before a Senate committee.

It would also be subject to a period of court-supervised probation.The Justice Department determined in May that Boeing breached a 2021 deferred-prosecution agreement tied to the crashes that was struck in the waning days of the Trump Administration. That followed the blowout of a fuselage panel on a 737 Max 9 on Jan 5, just days before the deal was set to expire.The guilty plea marks a low point in the company's century-long history after years of turmoil sparked by two crashes of its 737 Max aircraft in 2018 and 2019 that killed 346 people. The agreement also has the potential to complicate Boeing's interaction with govt as a major defence contractor.

SEATTLE: “IT’S TIME TO EARN IT BACK!!!” Reads the last line (in screaming all capital letters) of a notice board at Boeing ’s Renton final assembly line (FLA) in Seattle where the ill-famed MAX version of the once best-selling B737s are rolled out. It reminds technicians at work here that “737 conformance rate for multiple (assembly) processes have dropped below confidence level” and that the goal is to “ensure a conforming product (for) our customers.”Following two deadly crashes that left 346 people dead; subsequent global grounding for 21 months and a mid-air door blowout involving the MAX in last six years, the 108-year-old aerospace major is battling the biggest crisis of its lifetime — including potential criminal charges by the US justice department.The old slogan “if it’s not Boeing, I am not going,” is a distant memory at least for now.Amid belated enhanced oversight by America’s Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) as a consequence of the MAX mishaps, Boeing is trying hard to win the trust back. It recently opened the doors of its single (737) and twin (777) aisle FLAs in Seattle to a section of the world’s media, including TOI. The senior management there admitted of lapses in recent years, while assuring corrective steps are being taken. Process heads spoke of bringing back checks & balances that had been done away with, in pursuit of churning out planes quickly.Clearly, there’s a lot of work to be done to regain the confidence. Multiple aerospace industry insiders in the US who worked for or with Boeing said the focus in last few years had shifted from engineering excellence to financial performance. “I used to be with a supply chain partner and we were constantly asked to cut corners to reduce cost of our supplies. Beyond a point, it became difficult to work with Boeing,” said an engineer in San Francisco who did not want to be named.The final straw proved to be the most recent MAX scare — Jan 5, 2024, door plug blowout on an Alaska Air B737-9 MAX in the US. Elizabeth Lund, Boeing’s senior VP (quality) says the company’s first reaction “was to take immediate action to ensure that no airplane ever leads our factory that could cause an accident. I will tell you very transparently.”She gave an exhaustive list of steps taken to spruce up safety, including something as basic as spelling out the task required in simple English; end of line inspection for critical systems; ensuring work not completed in a process does not travel to the next stage of FLA; enhanced workforce training; eliminating defects and 100% following of safety and quality management systems.“We knew we needed to address systemic issues. The first is workforce experience. We have brought in so many employees since Covid and it overlapped with the time of the MAX grounding (March 2019-Dec 2020). We didn’t actually do an involuntary layoff but we didn’t get them (many of those who left) back. When we came out of the MAX grounding, we were back flying again. We were coming out of Covid and the market came back, incredibly fast at that point. We were hiring lots and lots of people in a short period of time (many) with less experience. (And in) many cases, no aerospace experience. Our build plans are at times complicated. Particularly for a new employee with no aerospace experience. Perhaps they speak English as a second language, (making things) even more complicated,” she said.Elizabeth Lund (Image credit: Saurabh Sinha)Boeing then started using artificial intelligence to go from “engineering English” to “more clear” English. So Instead of saying Boeing wants a 0.375 (unit of measure) hole plus or minus 0.05, it now says the hole should be between 0.356 and 0.393. Many newcomers were found to be “struggling to do jobs correctly”. So Boeing says it overhauled its foundational training and linked it to proficiency testing.A key challenge for the leadership is to keep the workforce morale high as it tries to the with the world’s confidence in its planes. “We are humans and are affected by what has unfortunately happened in the recent past,” said a technician at the MAX assembly line. Katie Ringgold, VP of the 737 programme and Renton site leader, had one request for the media during the shop floor visit, “Keep the tough questions for me and the leadership (and not pose them to the technicians there).”Jason Clark, VP & GM of the B777 programme and Everett site leader, said “employee involvement (EI) — where workers discuss production issues regularly — has been brought back over a month back. “It was done away with as there was a lot of overlap. By doing so, we lost the voice of the mechanic. Now we have again created groups for mechanics to discuss and fix problems,” Clark said.The increased focus on safety and checks has meant FAA asked Boeing to churn out a lot fewer that the 38 allowed B737 MAX per month. Customer airlines, including Air India Express and Akasa, don’t know what will be the delivery schedule of their ordered MAX. The popular Dreamliner (B787) production, assembled at a FLA in Charleston in South Carolina, is also hit. “The production programme in Charleston has been slowed down to stability due to supply chain issues. The steadfast focus is on fey and processes. We will up the rate in next few years and return to five 787s per month later in 2024,” said Scott Stocker, VP & GM B787 programme and South Carolina site leader.Following the Indonesian Lion Air B737 MAX crash in October 2018; Ethiopian B737 MAX crash in March 2019, these planes were grounded globally. They were allowed to resume flying in Dec 2020 after Boeing assured all required corrective action has been taken. Then the door plug blowout happened this Jan on a US carrier.Asked why should anyone believe Boeing that it is actually all that is required to make safe planes, Lund admitted she gets that question as lot. “After the Max crashes we took (many) positive steps. We (created) a separate organisation focused on safety. Just a couple of days (later) I took over this position. There were various levels of internal audit for our production system focused on quality…. We are a company deeply committed to flying safety; to public safety and to our employees. I believe (the current) plan will make us stronger. We are transparent with you (media), with our regulators and our customers. We have opened our factories up to our customers so that they can come in. The regulator has access to all of our data. There is no hidden agenda. There is no hidden data. We are a transparent company who deeply cares about safety and the public and our employees and we are committed to be better every day,” Lund tried to reassure.“We have for years dedicated to making air transportation as safe as humanly possible and continue that way. I believe that the actions we have taken for many years have allowed air transportation to be the safest means of transportation. We have taken steps to address (safety issues) and continue to do so,” she said.Boeing says it has used the Alaska Air door plug-out to “to step back, holistically look at everything and be very introspective. To see what else could we do? How can we be certain that our system is as absolutely robust as possible. So we started collecting input from many many sources.” Boeing received over 30,000 ideas, pain points and areas for improvement across the board, apart from directives of FAA auditors, which are the “primary foundation” of the make-planes-safe-again plan.“How we make sure we make the perfect airplane? The first is invest in workforce training. The second is simplify plans and processes. The third eliminate defects both coming in and that we create and the fourth, elevate our safety and quality,” Lund said.“A defect, non-conforming rivets, arrived from our supplier which in themselves did not create a safety hazard but needed to be fixed. The airplane then traveled throughout the factory. It moved to the end of the (FLA) line while we discussed with our supplier back and forth. By the time we all reached agreement that the rivets needed to be removed and replaced, we had a non-compliance to our process,” Lund said.That plug was opened “without correct documentation and paperwork”. Boeing has a “loop crew” who just button the airplane up for weather when it rolls out of the factory. “In this case, they closed the plug. They did not reinstall the retaining pins. That is not their job. Their job is to just close it and they count on existing paperwork…. The last step is what we call an okay to close. The the plug had a little bit of a fit. That’s how it was able to fly for roughly 150 cycles (before the blowout happened)… A defect entered our system from our supply chain which travelled throughout our final assembly. And then there was a lack of compliance to our processes,” Lund added.Speaking about this under investigation case has earned Boeing the ire of US regulatory agencies.The reporter was in Seattle at the invitation of Boeing.","Boeing is battling the biggest crisis of its lifetime — including potential criminal charges by the US justice department. Senior management there admitted of lapses in recent years, while assuring corrective steps are being taken. Process heads spoke of bringing back checks & balances that had been done away with in pursuit of churning out planes quickly.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111555685,imgsize-2028995,width-400,resizemode-4/111555685.jpg"
Rheinmetall and Leonardo's agreement seen as key to EU defence consolidation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/rheinmetall-and-leonardos-agreement-seen-as-key-to-eu-defence-consolidation/articleshow/111500424.cms,"Germany's Rheinmetall and Italy's Leonardo have formed a joint venture to consolidate the European defence vehicle sector .The chief executive of the two groups Armin Papperger of Rheinmetall and Roberto Cingolani of Leonardo has expressed their optimism about the partnership on Thursday.Papperger stated that the agreement has the potential to capitalize on a European market worth over 50 billion euros ($53.99 billion), according to Reuters.""My expectation is that, with (this) cooperation only on the vehicle side, there is a market of more than 50 bln euros, a huge market that we can conquer,"" Papperger said in a recorded message posted online.""We can help Europe grow, together, and this is a very first small step on the vehicle side for consolidation on the European level,"" he added.The formation of this joint venture could accelerate the consolidation of defence assets across Europe, a process that has been hindered by diverging national interests. However, Russia's ongoing conflict with Ukraine has raised hopes for more concerted efforts in this direction. Germany, for instance, is currently considering partnering with Carlyle, a private equity firm, to jointly acquire a majority stake in Thyssenkrupp's submarines and frigates division.The alliance between Rheinmetall and Leonardo aligns with the broader objective of both groups to create pan-European consortia for the development of new combat systems.Cingolani stated, ""The target is to create a machine that is cutting-edge for the future. A machine that is cross-domain and interoperable, talking, in the future, to satellites, helicopters and aircraft.""On Wednesday, the companies announced that they have agreed to form a joint venture to produce tanks and other land defence systems, reported Reuters.The first goal of the 50-50 enterprise, which will be headquartered in Italy, will be to develop the Italian Main Battle Tank and Armoured Infantry Combat System for the Italian Army, they said in a joint statement.",Germany's Rheinmetall and Italy's Leonardo have formed a joint venture to consolidate the European defence vehicle sector.

"EU imposes duties on China-built EVs, leaving four months for talks",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/eu-imposes-duties-on-china-built-evs-leaving-four-months-for-talks/articleshow/111484993.cms,"BRUSSELS: The European Union will impose tariffs of up to 37.6% from Friday on imports of electric vehicles made in China, EU officials said on Thursday, ratcheting up trade tension with Beijing.There is however a four-month window during which the tariffs are only provisional and intensive talks are expected to continue between the two sides.The European Commission 's provisional duties of between 17.4% and 37.6% without backdating are designed to prevent what its president Ursula von der Leyen has said is a threatened flood of cheap EVs built state subsidies.The rates are almost exactly the same as those announced by the Commission on June 12. The executive made slight adjustments after companies identified minor calculation errors in the initial disclosure.Beijing said then it would take ""all necessary measures"" to safeguard China's interests.These could include retaliatory tariffs on exports to China of products such as cognac or pork.The EU anti-subsidy investigation has nearly four more months to run.At the end of it, the Commission, the EU's executive arm, could propose ""definite duties"", typically applying for five years, on which EU members would vote.China's commerce ministry said on Thursday both sides have so far held several rounds of technical talks over tariffs on the issue.""There is still a four-month window before arbitration, and we hope that the European and Chinese sides will move in the same direction, show sincerity, and push forward with the consultation process as soon as possible,"" He Yadong, a ministry spokesperson, said.BYD will face duties of 17.4%, Geely 19.9% and SAIC 37.6%, the EU said on Thursday. These are on top of the EU's standard 10% duty on car imports.Companies deemed by the EU to have cooperated with the anti-subsidy investigation, including western carmakers Tesla and BMW, will be subject to 20.8% tariffs and those that did not cooperate a rate of 37.6%.The Commission has estimated Chinese brands' share of the EU market has risen to 8% from below 1% in 2019 and could reach 15% in 2025. It says prices are typically 20% below those of EU-made models.European policymakers are keen to avoid a repeat of what happened with solar panels a decade ago, when the EU took only limited action to curb Chinese imports and many European manufacturers collapsed. The EU launched its anti-subsidy investigation into Chinese EVs last October.The Chinese Passenger Car Association has said the tariffs will have only a modest impact on the majority of Chinese firms.The rates are far lower than the 100% tariff Washington plans to apply to Chinese EV imports from August.",The European Commission's provisional duties of between 17.4% and 37.6% without backdating are designed to prevent what its president Ursula von der Leyen has said is a threatened flood of cheap EVs built state subsidies.

These flight routes suffer the world’s worst turbulence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/these-flight-routes-suffer-the-worlds-worst-turbulence/articleshow/111428127.cms,"A series of incidents that left scores of airline passengers needing medical attention has shone a spotlight on the problem of severe in-flight turbulence .In recent months, Singapore Airlines Ltd., Qatar Airways and Air Europa flights have all suffered sudden drops in altitude, requiring passengers to need hospital treatment and, in Singapore’s case, leaving one man dead.Singapore Air Flight SQ321 encountered severe turbulence as it entered Thai airspace in late May, triggering an emergency landing in Bangkok. It was en route to Singapore from London.And this week, some 40 passengers were injured when an Air Europa flight hit severe turbulence on its way from Madrid to Montevideo, Uruguay.Severe Turbulence on Singapore Airline Flight | Incident left one person dead and dozens injured. Plane diverted to Bangkok for emergency landingWhile the most turbulent flights of all connect Santiago in Chile to Santa Cruz in Bolivia, there are similarly bumpy rides across the world, according to the turbli database. Flights leaving Tokyo dominate the list of the roughest long-haul services.Strong turbulence is produced when air streams traveling at significantly different speeds come together. This is typically encountered at the boundaries of jet streams, over mountains and in certain cloud storms, according to the turbli website.For instance, turbulence on the Santiago-Santa Cruz route is generated by winds from the Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic Ocean flowing almost perpendicular to the Andes. The equator is also a well-known region for turbulence because of strong upward currents and thunderstorm activity, turbli said. Japan has high levels of mountain- and ocean-induced turbulence.The turbli website produced its rankings by analyzing 150,000 routes using data from UK and US government meteorological agencies.","Singapore Air Flight SQ321 encountered severe turbulence as it entered Thai airspace in late May, triggering an emergency landing in Bangkok.
