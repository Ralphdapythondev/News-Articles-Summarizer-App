If a central government pensioner receives a basic pension of Rs 50,400 per month, at the previous 50% DR, they were getting Rs 25,200.

Zomato competes with Swiggy in both food delivery and quick commerce segments.While in the local food delivery market, Zomato and Swiggy have a duopoly, the quick commerce space has other players like Zepto and Tata's BigBasket competing for a share of the consumers' wallet.In a letter to shareholders, co-founder and CEO Deepinder Goyal said that the fundraise through a QIP would strengthen Zomato's balance sheet amid rising competition. The company's cash balance has reduced from Rs 14,400 crore to Rs 10,800 crore in three years (between its July 2021 listing to Q2 FY25) on the back of funding past quick commerce losses and some equity investments and acquisitions.

Railway Budget 2024 : The government has wavered little in its efforts to spur a modernisation of railways in the country, pivoting on technology, to support the country’s economic ambitions. In line with expectations, Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore, marking yet another year of successive increase in outlay.That takes forward the past policies and the government’s vision, which have paved the way for modernisation of the transport behemoth.In earlier decades, the government had focused on laying tracks on new routes, electrification and incremental rolling stock capacity addition. That was the need of the hour back then and has helped set up the base for a larger transformation.For instance, the massive Dedicated Freight Corridor ( DFC ) as well as locomotive factories at Marhaura and Madhepura in Bihar were conceptualised over a decade ago and we are seeing their completion now.More recently, the focus has shifted to modernisation—of rolling stock and safety systems, among other aspects.This year, emphasis has also been laid on the railways’ crucial role in industrial development. Commodity-specific corridors have been planned in eastern India and impetus given to port connectivity. Vande Bharat and technology-led upgrades in rolling stock remain in focus. Safety has been prioritised through budgetary allocations for the anti-collision systemKavach . That said, there are other cogs in the wheel that demand attention from a long-term perspective.First, the target for the Operating Ratio, the crucial efficiency gauge, has been set at 98.22% for 2024-25, compared with 98.65% in 2023-24. This reflects an imminent need for operational transformation. An effective overhaul of the world’s fourth-largest rail network will take many years and thus we need to start focusing on improving efficiency and reducing costs now.DFC is almost entirely operational and will be complete over the next few months. To ensure the project achieves its twin goals of reducing logistics costs and enhancing freight efficiency, railways need to attract more cargo on the corridor. This will help increase the rail coefficient and make the railways’ approach more market-oriented, which will in turn aid future corridors.A revamp of railway stations is on track, with sufficient funds dedicated to this end. But even though new coaches and wagons are increasingly being added to meet footfalls, the stations and passenger trains themselves remain synonymous with chaos.Just as safety, comfort and convenience have been prioritised, there is a need for solutions to address the capacity and demand challenges. As a first step, the government could target development of new stations and setting up of new coach production units.As a leading freight mover, Indian Railways carried a record 1,588 MT cargo in fiscal 2024, up from 1,095 MT in fiscal 2015. It accounts for 26% of the cargo moved in the country—by no means an easy feat. The railways aims to take this volume to 3,000 MT by 2030, which would require a 11% CAGR against the around 4.2% witnessed over the last 10 years. As per a report by TERI and Shakti Foundation, from carrying about 62% of freight traffic in 1990-91, Indian Railways’ share has declined to ~27% in 2014-15. This has been due to the expanding road network, cost competitiveness over railways, and door-to-door service. Thus, commencing the cycle of increasing the rail share again is commendable.DFCs, a high-capacity track network, high-power locomotives and improvement in wagon designs have set the ball rolling for larger capacity, faster freight trains that deliver better efficiency.Yet, achieving exponential growth is a tall ask given the current dynamics. Possibly, similar challenges might apply to other goals the railways might have for 2047.To be fair, despite its scale and complexity, Indian Railways has been able to achieve diverse developments at commendable speed.But the track ahead is long and it is time to start discussing the reinvention of the institutional set-up.Indian Railways sees substantial private sector involvement in the form of vendors and contractors. Policymakers could start mulling extreme options such as parallel privately-owned and operated railway infrastructure, coupled with centralised planning and an evolved role for the railways. This will need a robust policy framework from the Government of India.The time is perhaps also ripe to bring user charge and asset monetisation-driven segments for passengers as well as cargo to the discussion table. Globally, the separation of infrastructure and operations in railways has delivered mixed results, for example in the United Kingdom. The model should be analysed and revisited to understand its potential relevance in the Indian context.The key would be to retrace our steps and align our long-term goals to identify not just incremental changes but also ways to explore bold and path-breaking alternatives that put Indian Railways on a smooth track and bring it up to speed.","Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore.

Budget 2024 capital gains tax changes: The Narendra Modi government is considering suggestions for tweaks in the new long term capital gains tax regime that was announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman in Union Budget 2024.The July 23 budget reduced the LTCG tax on property from 20% to 12.5%. The indexation benefit, which allowed taxpayers to adjust the acquisition cost for inflation before calculating capital gains and thus reduce their tax liability, is proposed to be eliminated for properties purchased on or after April 1, 2001.The government publishes the Cost Inflation Index (CII) annually for this calculation.India Inc is appealing to the government for a gradual shift to the long-term capital gains tax regime proposed in the FY25 budget, which aims to eliminate indexation benefits for property, gold, and other unlisted assets.According to an ET report by Deepshikha Sikarwar, the industry is suggesting alternatives such as a higher tax rate with indexation or a lower rate of 12.5% without indexation, as well as some form of grandfathering for ancestral properties.The finance ministry is currently reviewing these proposals and will discuss them with the Prime Minister's Office.

Budget 2024 for manufacturing sector : The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth. While the middle class has been offered tax relief, the government's primary focus remains on judicious spending to maximize economic impact. The budget's core themes are employment, skilling, MSME development, and support for the middle class.Largely focus has remained intact on spending money judiciously to ensure that each penny spent creates a ripple effect in the entire economic landscape.Although at first glance, manufacturing might appear to have taken a backseat, a deeper analysis reveals a multifaceted approach to bolstering the sector. Initiatives like employment-linked benefits and internship programs, while primarily aimed at job creation and skill development, indirectly benefit manufacturing companies by expanding the talent pool.Extensive focus on the MSME manufacturing units by way of extending term loan facility for purchase of machinery and equipment without collateral or third-party guarantee, would help companies in augmenting their capital base/ capacity and strengthen the very foundation of the manufacturing ecosystem in the country. Development of a new credit-assessment model by Public Sector Banks to assess MSME credit shall provide much needed regulatory relief to the units.With respect to the large manufacturing entities, while there is no direct fiscal/ tax incentive introduced in this budget, some support has been provided with an extensive focus on development of ‘industrial parks’ in nearly 100 cities under the ‘plug and play’ model. Reforms proposed with respect to land administration, planning and management, shall also ease out acquisition related difficulties often faced by entrepreneurs/ business houses in acquiring lands for manufacturing set-ups.Targeted Customs duty interventions like, rationalization of Customs duty provisions in Mobile phone manufacturing setups, extension of Customs duty exemption on import of capital goods for manufacturing of solar cells and panels, full Customs duty exemption on import of 25 critical minerals,, shall provide the required impetus for enhancing domestic manufacturing environment.Governments’ focus on formulating an Economic Policy Framework to set the scope for next-gen reforms in the country, has a target to improve the productivity of factors of production, namely, land, labour, capital, entrepreneurship and technology. This shall pave the way for enabling achievement of a target of 25% manufacturing sector contribution to the nation’s GDP over the course of next 7-10 years.While the overall outlook is positive, the extension of tax benefits under Section 115BAB for manufacturing entities and the absence of new PLI schemes are notable omissions.The country’s manufacturing base is expanding as is reflective from the continuously increasing tax collections and expanding Purchasing Manager’s Index. It would be pertinent to see how the ground realities evolve vis-à-vis the vision envisaged, in the upcoming Financial Year.","While the overall outlook is positive, the extension of tax benefits under Section 115BAB for manufacturing entities and the absence of new PLI schemes are notable omissions.

Budget 2024: Armed with the vision to propel India to become a developed country by 2047, the Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business thereby providing the required stimulus to the manufacturing sector and enabling large scale job creation.On the Indirect tax front, the industry welcomes the much-needed announcement for a comprehensive review of the rate structure under Customs enabling ease in product classification and dispute reduction.The proposal of lowering of Customs duty on a plethora of raw materials and products including solar cells, critical minerals and bullion are encouraging measures. The rationale behind such reduction clearly indicates support towards domestic manufacturing, deepening value addition and supporting targets in reducing carbon footprint.Relevant amendments under the Customs law have been made to provide increased time limits for re-imports and re-exports to enhance competitiveness of the fledgling MRO sector. The government has extended significant duty reduction and exemption benefits to the healthcare and electronics sectors, continuing the impetus of incentives provided under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme.Since their introduction in March 2020, the PLI schemes have indeed supported in revitalizing the manufacturing sector and strengthening the necessary supply chains. The success achieved in the mobile manufacturing sector has now enabled the Government to reduce customs duties on mobile phones and components, signalling a mature environment. The Budget proposals aim at reproducing similar outcomes for semiconductor and pharmaceutical industry by increasing the budgetary allocation.Buoyed by the increasing revenue collection under GST signalling a shift towards a mature tax regime, this Budget has harmonized the timeframes for the issuance of demand notices and adjudication orders for cases involving fraud, suppression or otherwise. Significant amendments to the GST legislations have been introduced reflecting the recommendations proposed by the GST Council such as regularizing non-levy of GST due to general practice which may turn out to be a breather for certain impacted industries reeling under huge tax demands.The Insurance sector has been provided much relief through the GST council recommendations which have been cemented in the present budget thereby ending long standing disputes on their business practices.The Government's efforts to push forward with its reform agenda are evident as plans to incentivize states for their business reform actions plans and digitalization through the Jan Vishwas Bill 2.0 is proposed. Further, setting up of e-commerce export hubs is envisaged to facilitate easier access to international markets for domestic players.The recent implementation of Budget proposals allows the government to maintain momentum in its reform agenda. These policy measures implicitly reaffirm the significance of India Inc as a crucial element in the development of infrastructure. However, there are still some expectations required to be met to march towards a Viksit Bharat 2047.",Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business.

Budget 2024 : Real estate, a significant contributor to employment generation, has received a fair bit of attention in Budget 2024-25. Recent years have seen the sector transform rapidly, driven by factors such as favourable government policies, Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, strong economic growth and changing consumer preferences.Added to that, the budgetary focus on job creation, skilling and employment-linked incentives, infrastructure, urban development, rural connectivity, digitalisation and land-related norms, all dovetail to promote growth of the sector.Launched in June 2015, the PMAY aims to provide affordable housing to all eligible beneficiaries. The budget unveiled PMAY Urban 2.0, under which the housing needs of 1 crore urban poor and middle class will be addressed with an investment of Rs 10 lakh crore.The central government’s additional Rs 2.2 lakh crore injection in the next 5 years to make housing more affordable has the potential to revitalise the affordable housing market.Such an approach can play an important role in realising the government's vision of Housing for All and push growth and development. Hence, the significant investment under PMAY Urban 2.0 is expected to alleviate urban housing deficits, spurring construction and economic growth.Steps to introduce technological reforms within the regulatory framework for land, such as digitalisation or GIS mapping of land records, will improve transparency.Rationalisation of stamp duty across states will also be critical to bring in uniformity and initiate land-related reforms such as urban planning, usage and building bylaws.These are steps in the right direction and will boost growth. Moreover, they will improve the ease of property transactions and strengthen municipal finances through increased property taxes. Rationalization of stamp duty with an emphasis on women homebuyers may boost home-buyer sentiment in major cities, too.The budget has also given ample attention to urban and rural development, with rental housing for industrial workers through the public private partnership model, interest subsidies for rental housing, and transit-oriented developments.The proposal to develop investment-ready plug-and-play industrial parks in 100 cities may attract industrial investment, leading to increased demand for industrial real estate and support the growth of ancillary services and residential developments in these regions.Initiatives for industrial parks and rental housing for industrial workers align with the country’s manufacturing goals and addresses worker accommodation needs.These steps are expected to promote industrial growth and stability in labour-intensive sectors, while also creating new opportunities for real estate developers specialising in rental and affordable housing.The changes in long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax, however, have evoked a mixed reaction. The government lowered the long-term capital gains tax from 20% to 12.5%, which is a welcome step. However, this came with the removal of the indexation benefit.The changes could encourage more liquidity in property transactions and potentially increase the effective tax burden depending on the property’s acquisition date.The launch of Phase IV of the PM Gram Sadak Yojana in 25,000 rural habitations will improve connectivity in rural areas, promoting rural development and making these regions more accessible for investment. The primary objective of PMGSY is to build robust, all-weather roads in rural habitations. This initiative focuses on enhancing connectivity and supporting economic development in rural areas.In essence, the budget is geared towards stimulating growth and investment in the real estate sector , fostering a more transparent and investor-friendly environment, and contributing to overall development. It aims to create a balanced and inclusive growth environment by addressing the needs of various segments, including affordable housing, industrial workers and urban infrastructure.The effectiveness of the initiatives, however, hinges on their implementation and continued support of complementary reforms.","The budget unveiled PMAY Urban 2.0, under which the housing needs of 1 crore urban poor and middle class will be addressed with an investment of Rs 10 lakh crore.

New Budget 2024 rule: Why Income Tax Department is likely to issue a huge number of tax notices this month,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-budget-2024-rule-why-income-tax-department-is-likely-to-issue-a-huge-number-of-tax-notices-this-month/articleshow/112186079.cms,"Taxing Times

Income Tax Notice on the way? The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month, as there are concerns that many taxpayers might escape the tax net due to the impending implementation of the new reassessment law on September 1, 2024.According to the amended regulation announced in Budget 2024 , the tax authorities can only go back a maximum of five years to reassess a taxpayer's records if the escaped income is at least Rs 50 lakh, and three years for an amount less than Rs 50 lakh.Previously, they could reassess cases up to 10 years old.According to an ET report, tax officials are now faced with the challenge of compiling and corroborating data on tax and income mismatches for the financial years 2013-14 to 2017-18 within the next few weeks, as these years will become time-barred for reassessment from September 1, 2024.The I-T department relies on information from various sources, such as banks, property registrars, and search findings from the investigation wing, to build reassessment cases.A tax officers' body has raised concerns about the feasibility of issuing notices under Section 148 (or 148A) in a large number of cases within a single month, given the overburdened nature of the jurisdictional assessing officers and the time-consuming process of obtaining sanction from the chief commissioner, who is the specified authority for such notices.Moreover, the law provides taxpayers with the right to explain their position before reassessment orders are finalized, a process that most believe cannot be completed by the end of August.Also Read | ITR refund status for FY 2023-24: How to check income tax refund status online - here’s a step-by-step guide for incometax.gov.in & NSDL websites The Central Board of Direct Taxes ( CBDT ) has been urged by its officers to postpone the effective date of the proposed amendment. However, this suggestion is unlikely to be well-received by corporations and high net worth individuals.""Capping the reassessment period at five years was a great decision as it would reduce hassles and litigation. But if the department fears there could be a genuine loss of revenue as it may not be possible to wrap up several matters by August 31, the government can think of strict parameters where time-bound cases can be selectively reopened - based on trails of steps taken in identifying escaped income,"" said Mitil Chokshi, partner at CA firm Chokshi & Chokshi.""Taxpayers may expect a rush of reassessment notices in August 2024. These notices are likely to be for the AYs 2018-19 and prior to that. It is pertinent to note that the Bombay High Court in a recent ruling in a case of Hexaware Technologies has taken a view on a proviso introduced in 2021, which can be interpreted to mean that AY 2017-18 (and prior years) got time barred on March 31, 2024. These reassessment notices (for AYs 2017-18 and prior) are likely to rake up new interpretation issues in the already muddled reassessment provisions,"" said Ashish Mehta, partner at law firm Khaitan & Co.The current situation is similar to the conflict between the Income Tax office and taxpayers in 2021. The reassessment law was amended in April 2021, allowing the tax office to reopen 10-year-old tax returns if the total undisclosed income exceeded Rs 50 lakh and reassess 4-year-old matters if the amount was less than Rs 50 lakh.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? However, this change led to over 10,000 writ petitions being filed by companies, arguing that they were not given sufficient time to explain and that the notices were issued without considering the carve-out that cases which couldn't be reopened earlier couldn't be reassessed under the new law.The Supreme Court invoked its extraordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution on May 4, 2022, to uphold all reassessment notices issued after March 31, 2021. However, the court left room for judicial proceedings based on the merits of each case, and several such matters are currently pending before the court.","The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month.

NPS and EPF: Overlapping services

What is NPS Vatsalaya?

Latest NPS rules, news: In the Union Budget 2024 speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced two new initiatives with regard to National Pension Scheme (NPS) - extension of NPS 14% employer contribution benefits to private setcor and the intended launch of NPS Vatsalya.Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries, bringing it at par with the provisions available for government employees.Sriram Iyer, CEO, HDFC Pension Management told ET that with this move the “ground rules have been harmonised among government and non-government employees, which is a positive step.”Effectively, this means that now, private-sector employees can choose to reduce the taxable portion of employers’ contribution to their NPS corpus, thereby paying less tax and leaving greater funds in their pension deposits.“Employees will benefit from tax savings . More importantly, the 40% increase in contribution will have a significant impact on the terminal value of the retirement corpus,” remarked Iyer. The extended savings will “help in retirement planning, working as an option that is at par with the Provident Fund,” Dinesh Rohira, CEO & Founder, 5nance.com was quoted as saying.Moreover, the endeavour aims to increase NPS penetration by increasing tax incentives for the private sector, providing them a social security-cushion post-retirement.The scheme’s motive to widen the NPS subscriber base may not prove to be flawlessly effective, however. This is explained by Agrees Mrin Agarwal, Founder, Finsafe India: “While it’s good that the limit has been raised, it may not increase adoption as employees need to be educated in a big way. Also, the benefit is only for the salaried opting for the new tax regime,” she says.The mandatory contribution to the EPF, too, threatens to relegate the provisions of NPS under the umbrella of near-superfluity. This sentiment is echoed by Varun Sahay, a software engineer in a Delhi-based IT company: “When 12% of my salary is already deducted for the EPF, why should I put in more in the NPS and cut my take-home pay?”Rohira feels otherwise. “There’s no competition between the NPS and EPF as employees can contribute to both and build a 3-4 times bigger corpus while earning 3-4% higher returns via marketlinked options in the NPS,” he counters.Also Check | New Tax Regime 2023 vs 2024 After Budget: How Much Income Tax Will Salaried Taxpayers Save & How Do New Tax Slabs Compare To Old Regime?

This scheme allows parents and guardians to contribute to a minor's account, which can be converted into a regular NPS account once the child reaches adulthood.""It provides a very long duration for reaping the compounding benefits and accumulating a huge bounty at a later age. This can be a good way to plan a better future for kids who may not opt for a service segment in the future,"" says Rohira. Sriram Iyer agrees, stating, ""It’s a good move to help the child start his retirement journey. Even if a parent starts when the child is 10 years old, by the time he starts working, it can be a solid foundation for the compounding journey after that.""However, some experts question the utility of a product with such a long lock-in period, especially when parents cannot use the funds for essential goals like their child’s education amidst soaring education costs of 11-12%.""Parents are struggling to save for their own retirement, so it might be a bit of a stretch to expect them to save for their kids’ retirement. The need of the hour is a market-linked product that allows withdrawals only for the child’s education,"" says Mrin Agarwal, Founder of Finsafe India.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? Though the NPS permits partial withdrawals, it allows only 25% of the corpus after three years of joining, and this can be done only three times during the entire tenure. A premature exit before 60 years with 100% withdrawal is only possible if the corpus is less than Rs.2.5 lakh, an amount insufficient for most children's goals.""In its current form, there won’t be any uptake,"" asserts Agarwal. Rohira concurs, ""It’s a vanilla product with a lock-in, which does not make it very attractive and it may not take off. However, the government may optimise it and introduce new features later."" Iyer adds, ""This is just a start and there may be more subscriber-friendly features as we take it to the market. The regulator is proactive and open to feedback.""","Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries. The extended savings will “help in retirement planning, working as an option that is at par with the Provident Fund,” says Dinesh Rohira, CEO & Founder, 5nance.com.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112108789,imgsize-82176,width-400,resizemode-4/112108789.jpg"
Gold import duty cut: Why Indians may not find buying gold from Dubai as attractive post Budget 2024,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-import-duty-cut-why-indians-may-not-find-buying-gold-from-dubai-as-attractive-post-budget-2024/articleshow/112097671.cms,"Gold import duty cut: Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group, estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India.

Gold import duty cut in Budget 2024: The recent reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai. Indian jewellers with stores in both India and the UAE believe that the narrowed duty differential will result in lower gold prices in India, making it less attractive for Indians to purchase gold in Dubai.The emirate had attracted gold-enthusiast Indians following a steep rise in customs duty in India in July 2022. In the fiscal 2024-25 budget, the duty on gold imports was more than halved.The duty cut is also expected to boost gold jewellery production in India, particularly the popular 'Kolkatti' jewellery from Kolkata, which is favored by Indian expats in Dubai and tourists from various countries. This move will encourage gold artisans to create new designs in both heavyweight and lightweight jewellery, attracting consumers to purchase gold from India.According to an ET report, Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group , estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India as Indian tourists who previously bought jewellery in Dubai will now prefer to shop in India. However, Indian expats living in Dubai and other customers may continue to buy from the UAE.Also Read | Gold losing sheen? Government cuts gold bond issuance target as investors look at better alternatives Rajiv Popley, director at Popley & Sons, believes that the perception of overseas gold being cheaper than in India is merely a mindset. He points out that the labour cost is significantly lower in India, and with the introduction of mandatory hallmarking and HUID numbers, the purity of gold in India is no longer a concern.Furthermore, NRIs in Dubai do not receive VAT refunds, and Indians travelling abroad only receive about 60% of the VAT back on their gold purchases. Gold trade analyst Bhargav Baidya suggests that the 1% duty differential between gold jewellery in India and Dubai will be offset by Indian jewellers offering discounts to retain and attract customers.Saurabh Gadgil, chairman of PNG Jewellers, notes that Indian import duty is now on par with the US, allowing Indian jewellers to offer competitive prices compared to other countries worldwide. The reduced customs duty is expected to make gold purchases in India more attractive and convenient for Indian consumers, potentially leading to a significant shift in their gold shopping preferences.","The reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers.

Gold Bonds losing sheen

Gold losing sheen? The government has reduced its target for issuing gold bonds in the financial year 2024-25 by 38% compared to the previous interim budget goal, according to a senior official. The revised target stands at Rs 18,500 crore, down from Rs 29,638 crore estimated in the interim budget and Rs 26,852 crore (revised estimate) in 2023-24.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told ET ""The decision followed a reassessment of various factors, including investor demand, other investment products and uncertainties around the global economy, as the situation has changed since the interim budget in February.""After accounting for redemptions, the net issuances of sovereign gold bonds are now estimated at Rs 15,000 crore for this fiscal year, a significant decrease from the Rs 26,138 crore projected in the interim budget and Rs 25,352 crore in the revised estimate for 2023-24.Harish Galipelli, director at ILA Commodities India, attributed this shift to retail investors increasingly opting for equities in anticipation of better returns. He also noted that people are uncertain about the potential for further increases in gold prices in the short-to-medium term following a recent rally. Additionally, Galipelli pointed out that savings in rural areas have been impacted by retail inflation and other factors.The gold bond and gold monetisation schemes were introduced by the government in late 2015 to discourage the physical purchase of precious metals and reduce imports, thereby mitigating the negative impact on the current account deficit.The gross collection through these two schemes is now projected to be Rs 20,030 crore in 2024-25, compared to Rs 31,168 crore in the interim budget and Rs 28,240 crore (revised estimate) in the previous fiscal year. Similarly, the net collection is estimated at Rs 16,433 crore, down from Rs 27,571 crore in the interim budget and Rs 26,653 crore in the previous year. However, the estimates for the gold monetisation scheme remain unchanged from the interim budget level.Also Read | Budget 2024: Duty cuts on gold, silver, platinum, and diamonds to make jewellery more affordable The sovereign gold bond scheme targets investors who view gold as an investment, encouraging them to purchase paper gold instead of physical gold.On the other hand, the gold monetisation scheme aims to bring out idle gold held by households, temple trusts, and others to increase domestic supply. Both schemes were designed to curb gold imports, which, along with crude oil, have been significant contributors to India's current account deficit.

MUMBAI: The sensex plunged 931 points, its biggest single-day drop in three weeks, on Tuesday, driven by disappointing corporate earnings and sustained selling by foreign portfolio investors who continued to sell India and buy China.

Allianz seeks to exit its insurance joint ventures with Bajaj,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/allianz-seeks-to-exit-its-insurance-joint-ventures-with-bajaj/articleshow/114483713.cms,"file photo

MUMBAI: In a move that could result in a multi-billion dollar cashing out by a foreign partner , Allianz has indicated to Bajaj Finserv that it wants to exit from their joint ventures in life and non-life insurance and pursue other opportunities in the Indian market. The two companies are partners in Bajaj Allianz General and Life Insurance companies.Currently, the German insurer holds a 26% stake in both ventures. Despite relaxed FDI limits, Allianz did not increase its stake due to a disagreement with its partner after a two-decade-old agreement to raise the stake at a pre-agreed price could not be implemented within 15 years as was envisaged earlier.As of March 24, Bajaj Allianz General holds a 7% market share in the non-life business, making it the second-largest private insurer after ICICI Lombard, which has a 8.5% share and a market capitalisation of Rs 98,000 crore. Similarly, Bajaj Allianz Life has a 7.4% market share among private life companies. The joint venture dates back to 2001 and has survived decades.Allianz has said that it remains committed to the Indian insurance market, and there is speculation on whether it will tie up with another partner or go alone. While most business houses have already floated an insurance company, Jio Financial Services is understood to be preparing to launch its insurance business.The split marks the coming of age of Indian joint ventures whose valuations are now a significant part of their multinational parent. For instance, the largest private life company HDFC Life has a market cap of nearly Rs 1.6 lakh crore as against Rs 33,590 crore of its one-time parent Abrdn (formerly Standard Life). Similarly, Prudential has a market cap of Rs 1.9 lakh crore as against the Rs 1.1 lakh crore valuation of ICICI Prudential.An exit by the German insurer would entail either a buyout by Bajaj or a stake sale to new investors or divestment through an IPO. Analysts do not see an impact in the insurance operations of the two companies as the foreign partner's participation is only at the board level and domestic operations are not dependent on Allianz for technical support.""Allianz, in case it exits the joint venture, has committed full support to Bajaj in ensuring a smooth transition to the Bajaj brand, keeping in mind the interest of policyholders, business partners, employees and other stakeholders of the insurance companies,"" Bajaj Finserv said in a statement to the exchanges.In 2001, German insurer Allianz and two-wheeler manufacturer Bajaj Auto formed a partnership, with Allianz holding a 26% stake - then the maximum allowable limit for foreign investors.",Allianz has indicated to Bajaj Finserv that it wants to exit from their joint ventures in life and non-life insurance.

NEW DELHI: Several important clues have popped up in the investigations into the mysterious blast outside a CRPF school in Delhi's Rohini area that took place on Sunday morning.The massive blast, reported from outside the school in Prashant Vihar, was recorded in the CCTV cameras installed in the vicinity.The explosion, though low in intensity, shattered windows of nearby buildings.Interestingly, in CCTV videos, a suspect wearing a white T-shirt was spotted near the scene hours before the blast, though his identity remains unclear.An FIR filed in connection with the case stated that the explosion left a half-foot-deep crater in a wall, with white powder scattered near the blast site.Thick white smoke and a chemical-like odour added to the scene’s chaos as authorities began their investigation.Police are investigating whether the blast was meant to send a message to former R&AW officer Vikas Yadav, whose parent cadre is CRPF.Delhi Police have also sought information from Telegram regarding the ' Justice League India ' channel, which claimed responsibility. The channel is reportedly linked to the banned Khalistan Zindabad outfit.Investigators believe the IED was detonated using a remote or timed device. Authorities are examining potential Khalistani connections due to the circulated messages and the CRPF link.Specialized teams, including the NIA, NSG, CRPF, and Delhi Police, are probing the blast site. A suspect wearing a white T-shirt was spotted near the scene, but their identity remains unclear.On Monday, police confirmed they had sent an official request to Telegram Messenger for critical information related to the channel that disseminated the post and CCTV footage of the incident.Though authorities are investigating possible Khalistani links—since a message with a ""Khalistan Zindabad"" watermark was shared on the Telegram channel—no group has been definitively tied to the blast, and all potential angles are being explored, officials said.","The massive blast, reported from outside the school in Prashant Vihar, was recorded in the CCTV cameras installed in the vicinity.

"Chinese food delivery industry faces downturn, workers' earnings drop by 1,000 yuan",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/chinese-food-delivery-industry-faces-downturn-workers-earnings-drop-by-1000-yuan/articleshow/114392615.cms,"Representative image

China's food delivery industry is experiencing a downturn after significant growth during the Covid-19 pandemic. Delivery workers ' earnings have dropped by nearly 1,000 yuan ($140) per month compared to five years ago, according to a report from the China New Employment Research Center .The $200 billion food delivery sector, the largest in the world by revenue and order volume, had provided a steady income for many casual workers.However, these workers are now struggling due to China’s economic slowdown , driven by a property crisis and weak consumer spending , leading to reduced income and job instability for delivery workers.Last year, delivery workers earned an average of 6,803 yuan ($956) per month, as per the China New Employment Research Center report. This is nearly 1,000 yuan ($140) less per month than what they earned five years ago, despite many working longer hours. In comparison, China's national average monthly wage was 1,838 yuan ($258) last year, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).NBS also reported a slowdown in third-quarter growth, with gross domestic product (GDP) rising by 4.6% from July to September, slightly exceeding economists' forecasts of 4.5%.Jenny Chan, an associate professor of sociology at the Polytechnic University of Hong Kong , said that delivery workers face continued pressure due to cost-cutting measures by delivery platforms. ""They are working long hours, really being squeezed,"" Chan said. ""They will continue to face pressure as delivery platforms need to keep costs low,"" she added.Chan also said that the economic downturn has shifted consumer preferences toward cheaper meals, further reducing delivery workers' earnings, even as they work longer hours to maintain their income.In addition, delivery workers often feel pressured to meet tight deadlines, leading them to take risks such as speeding or running red lights, which endangers both themselves and others on the road.","China's food delivery industry is experiencing a downturn after significant growth during the Covid-19 pandemic.

"From December 28, higher compensation for international flyers for death, delay",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/from-december-28-higher-compensation-for-international-flyers-for-death-delay/articleshow/114383317.cms,"MUMBAI: In a move set to benefit passengers boarding international flights , including those to and from India, the International Civil Aviation Organization ( ICAO ) has announced significant increases in compensation limits payable by airlines in cases of death, injury, flight delay , and baggage and cargo issues.The revised upper limit for compensation payable under the Montreal Convention will take effect on Dec 28, said ICAO Saturday.For instance, the upper limit for compensation in the event of death has increased from 1,28,821 Special Drawing Rights (SDR) to 1,51,880 SDR. In case of international flights to/from India, this is an increase from Rs 1.4 crore to Rs 1.7 crore, based on current rates.The Montreal Convention, formally known as the Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules for International Carriage by Air (MC99), establishes a comprehensive framework for international air travel. It sets liability limits for airlines in cases of injury, death, delay, baggage, and cargo issues.The revision comes as part of the Convention's built-in review mechanism, which adjusts for inflation every five years. ICAO has asked these countries to put in place legal provisions by the end of Dec. The MC99 liability limits apply to 140 countries, including India.The revision pertains solely to the upper limit for compensation payable by airlines and is not an indicator of the actual compensation the next of kin might receive in the event of death.For instance, the compensation payable for the 21 deaths and 167 non-fatal injuries in the 2020 Air India Express IX-1344 Dubai-Calicut accident came under the provisions of MC99. The then govt-owned airline paid the next of kin compensation, ranging from Rs 10 lakh for families of adults over 12 years old to Rs 5 lakh for families of children under 12 years. An interim compensation of Rs 2 lakh was provided to critically injured passengers and about Rs 50,000 to other injured passengers.The passengers sought legal recourse for compensation payable to them under MC99. They contended that under the Convention, a fixed amount of Rs 1.34 crore must be paid. Kerala HC dismissed the case, stating that the petitioners voluntarily accepted the compensation initially offered by Air India Express and so could not subsequently challenge it as being lower. The petitioners moved the Supreme Court. Last Oct, the SC issued a notice to Air India, now a private carrier, in response to the special leave petitions filed by passengers seeking higher compensation for the death of their kin.","The revised upper limit for compensation payable under the Montreal Convention will take effect on Dec 28.

Meta: 'Self-Taught Evaluator': Meta releases new AI tools for autonomous AI development,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/self-taught-evaluator-meta-releases-new-ai-tools-for-autonomous-ai-development/articleshow/114366250.cms,"Representative Image (Picture credit: Reuters)

Meta , the parent company of Facebook , unveiled a set of innovative AI models developed by its research division on Friday, reported Reuters.Among the standout tools is the "" Self-Taught Evaluator ,"" which may reduce the need for human involvement in the AI development process. This development is an important step towards creating AI systems capable of learning from their own mistakes, potentially paving the way for more autonomous and intelligent digital agents.In addition to the Self-Taught Evaluator, Meta also released updates to its image-identification Segment Anything model, a tool for accelerating response generation times in large language models (LLMs), and datasets designed to support the discovery of new inorganic materials.First introduced in an August research paper, the Self-Taught Evaluator uses the same ""chain of thought"" technique employed by OpenAI 's latest models. This approach involves breaking complex tasks into smaller steps to increase accuracy in fields like science, coding, and mathematics.Crucially, Meta’s researchers trained the evaluator entirely on AI-generated data, eliminating the need for human input during the training phase.According to Meta researchers, the ability of AI to evaluate other AI models accurately opens new possibilities for autonomous AI systems that can self-improve. This could lead to the development of digital assistants capable of performing a wide range of tasks without human intervention.Self-improving AI models may also reduce reliance on the costly and time-consuming process of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), which involves specialised human annotators verifying data and checking AI-generated answers for accuracy.Jason Weston, one of Meta's researchers, expressed hope that as AI becomes more advanced, it will become increasingly capable of verifying its own work, surpassing human accuracy.Other companies, such as Google and Anthropic, have also been exploring the concept of Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF).However, unlike Meta, these companies have been more cautious in releasing their models to the public.","Meta, the parent company of Facebook, unveiled a set of innovative AI models developed by its research division.
