Infosys & Wipro see sharp decline in number of employees earning over Rs 1 crore,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/infosys-wipro-see-sharp-decline-in-number-of-employees-earning-over-rs-1-crore-heres-why/articleshow/111275702.cms,"Paycheck at IT companies

Number of crorepati employees at Indian IT companies dips! The number of employees earning over Rs 1 crore at India's leading IT companies, Infosys and Wipro , has significantly decreased over the past two fiscal years. This decline is attributed to the slowdown in demand for technology services following the pandemic.The post-pandemic surge in demand for digital services had initially led to a fierce talent war, with companies like Infosys, Wipro, TCS, and HCLTech offering substantial salary increases to attract the best talent. However, this talent war quickly subsided due to global macroeconomic uncertainty and geopolitical tensions.According to an ET report, Infosys experienced a nearly 16% reduction in crorepati employees, with the number dropping from 123 in FY22 to 103 at the end of FY24. Similarly, Wipro saw a 12% decrease, with the number of crorepati employees falling from 92 in FY22 to 81 in FY24.Industry experts believe that this decline in high-earning employees at top IT exporters is a result of the reset across the $250 billion IT industry, which is currently facing one of the most challenging demand environments in recent years.In the financial year 2024, Infosys witnessed an addition of 12 employees earning over Rs 1 crore annually. Notably, these high earners were among the 1,400 IT staff transferred from Danske Bank to the Bengaluru-based firm following an outsourcing agreement in September of the previous year. Interestingly, Infosys itself did not directly hire any employees with a yearly compensation exceeding Rs 1 crore in fiscal 2024, marking the first such instance since FY17.On the other hand, Wipro onboarded eight employees with salaries of Rs 1 crore or more throughout the fiscal year 2024. The company's annual report, released on Monday, revealed that more than 60% of its workforce had been hired in the past three years. This highlights the significant talent turnover experienced during the tenure of former CEO Thierry Delaporte, which came to an unexpected end in April 2024, a year before his five-year term was set to conclude.Among the senior executives who departed from Wipro during FY24 were former CFO Jatin Dalal and former chief growth officer Stephanie Trautman, along with other key personnel.Also Read | Infosys announces up to Rs 8 lakh incentive package for employees open to transfer to Hubballi campus It is important to note that the number of crorepati employees listed in the annual reports of Infosys and Wipro only includes those who were posted in India during FY24 and have drawn their salary for the full fiscal year. This number does not account for employees who joined or resigned mid-year and were employed by these companies for only a portion of the year.Additionally, experts highlight the impact of the rapid growth in global capability centres (GCCs) on the talent profile of India's leading software exporters.The Indian IT industry is witnessing a significant shift in leadership talent, with many executives moving to midcap companies and Global Capability Centers (GCCs) in pursuit of top leadership positions, particularly CEO roles. Munira Loliwala, vice president for business strategy and growth at TeamLease Digital, a staffing firm, highlighted this trend, stating, ""A lot of leadership talent has, of late, switched to midcaps (IT companies) and GCCs in India, largely to become CEOs or as part of the top leadership.""Also Read | Why IT majors like Cognizant, Infosys, HCLTech are acquiring engineering services companies However, the industry is also facing challenges due to a slowdown in demand, which has forced companies to reduce hiring as they grapple with pressure on both margins and growth. Loliwala noted, ""Due to the continuing softness in demand, companies which are pressured on both margins and growth front have put brakes on hiring."" Consequently, five out of the six largest Indian IT services firms have experienced a decrease in their headcounts during the fiscal year 2024.The combined headcount reduction for these top six companies amounts to nearly 75,000 employees, a situation that is unprecedented for an industry that was once considered a bellwether. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), the industry leader, saw its headcount decline by 13,249 in FY24, while Infosys and Wipro recorded drops of 25,994 and 24,516, respectively, during the same period. HCLTech stood out as the only exception, with a modest increase of 1,537 in its headcount.",The number of employees earning over Rs 1 crore at India's leading IT companies has significantly decreased over the past two fiscal years.

Standard deduction may rise under new tax regime,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/standard-deduction-may-rise-under-new-tax-regime/articleshow/111212512.cms,"NEW DELHI: The finance ministry is assessing the possibility of raising the standard deduction limit for income taxpayers under the new regime, without tinkering with the exemption-laced older regime.Besides, as the NDA govt readies to present its first Budget of its third term, it is unlikely to undertake major tweaks in capital gains mechanism, an issue on which the income tax department has been seeking a review. There have been suggestions to align the holding period across asset classes but govt may not be inclined to disturb the system, at least for the moment.While discussions on the contours of the Budget have just begun with finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman undertaking public consultations, most of the exercise is currently limited to the finance ministry and internal assessment is being undertaken on multiple issues some of which will be discussed with other wings of govt before the finance ministry takes a final call, based on feedback from the PMO.The overall mood indicates that most wings of govt are in favour of offering concessions to taxpayers, especially the middle class, which has been a supporter of the Modi regime but is increasingly raising questions about the returns it gets for the tax it pays, be it through public healthcare or education.In the 2023 Budget, FM had introduced a standard deduction of Rs 50,000 for salaried taxpayers and those who earn pension under the new tax regime, which became the default option, unless you opted out. Also, rebate under Section 87A was increased under the new tax regime for taxable incomes not exceeding Rs 7 lakh, allowing those earning up to this level (taxable income) to not pay any tax under the new regime. The highest surcharge under the new regime was also removed.Currently, individuals with a taxable income of upwards of Rs 3 lakh have to pay 5% income tax and there have been suggestions from industry leaders to tweak the rates in the higher brackets to boost consumption. A higher standard deduction will benefit all the salaried taxpayers, including those in the upper segment although it will entail some revenue loss.","The finance ministry is assessing the possibility of raising the standard deduction limit for income taxpayers under the new regime.

Relief for taxpayers soon? ‘Faceless' income tax assessment mechanism to be made friendlier,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/relief-for-taxpayers-soon-faceless-income-tax-assessment-mechanism-to-be-made-friendlier/articleshow/111281170.cms,"Income Tax Assessment

Income Tax Assessment mechanism to be more taxpayer friendly? The Indian government is currently evaluating the 'faceless' income tax (I-T) assessment system to enhance its taxpayer-friendliness, based on recommendations for improving the program's effectiveness.Introduced on April 1, 2021, the scheme was designed to minimize human interaction in tax disputes and assessments. Under this system, the income tax department handles return processing, refund issuance, tax assessments , scrutiny, and appeal management. Cases are randomly assigned to assessing officers, irrespective of geographical jurisdiction.Sources familiar with the matter told ET that a hybrid approach is under consideration, which would allow taxpayers to choose between the faceless scheme and in-person resolution. ""It is being reviewed to assess effectiveness,"" an official was quoted as saying. He also said that making it optional for taxpayers is a potential solution.Another official mentioned that the aim is to tackle implementation challenges and further simplify compliance for taxpayers. The final decision will be made soon, the official added.Although the video conferencing-based assessment system is considered stable, there has been an increasing demand from both individual and business taxpayers to allow some level of in-person interaction. Additionally, the income tax department's field formations have been advocating for a more hybrid approach to ensure optimal and effective resource utilization.Assessing taxes is a multifaceted process, and experts believe that interactive communication between the taxpayer and the tax officer can lead to more effective outcomes.Also Read | Form 26 AS: Filing Income Tax Return?

Gautam Adani claimed that amplified by a segment of biased media, Hindenburg's allegations were intended to tarnish the group’sreputation, inflict maximum harm, and undermine its market value. In a scenario where many companies would have faltered, Adani said that the group’s liquidity proved to be its strongest asset. To further strengthen financial reserves, Adani group secured an additional Rs 40,000 crore, ensuring it can comfortably manage debt repayments for the next two years.

At the time as well, Adani had refuted all the accusations.According to an ET report, at Adani Enterprises' Annual General Meeting on Monday, Gautam Adani said, “Typical short sellers target gains from financial markets. This was different. It was a two-sided attack – a vague criticism of our financial standing and, at the same time, an information distortion campaign, dragging us into a political battlefield.”Adani claimed that the short-seller attack was designed to defame group, do maximum damage. He also said that the headwinds that tested the Adani Group made it stronger.With the National Democratic Alliance, led by Narendra Modi , securing power for a third consecutive term, the Adani Group is well-equipped to further the economic and social initiatives that have fueled its remarkable progress over the past ten years, Gautam Adani said at the AGM, according to the ET report.Adani asserted, ""India is no longer at the crossroads of destiny – we stand on the brink of our greatest growth phase. By the end of this decade, our nation is set to become the world's third-largest economy."" He further added, ""Given our demographic dividend, we are well on our way to being the largest middle class that the world will ever witness.""Adani also said, ""Despite never having faced any challenges with debt repayments, we chose to drop our Debt to EBITDA ratio to 2.5x in just six months. It now stands even lower at 2.2x.

How rupee went from most to least volatile in Asia,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/how-rupee-went-from-most-to-least-volatile-in-asia/articleshow/111296963.cms,"Why was the rupee Asia's most volatile currency?

What tamed wild swings

?

What does less volatility mean for investors?

What does bond index inclusion mean?

The rupee has gone from being one of Asia's most volatile currencies to among its most stable in the span of a decade. The turnaround reflects India's growing economic heft and RBI 's interventions to manage the rupee's wild swings. With Indian bonds set to join an important global index this week, the currency 's stability couldn't have come at a better time, burnishing the appeal of Indian assets for investors. Too much volatility makes it tough for businesses and investors as it could add to their costs. Here's a deeper look at how the rupee's fortunes have been transformed:About a decade ago, India's inflation rate was around 10% - stoked in part by govt's decision to spend its way out of an economic slump that followed the global financial crisis - and crude oil, a key import, was trading at more than $100 a barrel. Frustration over political scandals and policy paralysis threatened to derail India's economic growth and its image as an investment destination. It all made for a toxic mix for investors, at just the wrong time, as the Federal Reserve's plan to reduce bond purchases in 2013 shook emerging markets. The prospect of Treasury yields moving higher brought a flood of investor cash out of developing countries like India back to the US at the time.The rupee continued to weaken against the dollar during Modi's rule, but the swings became less wild over that period. Economic growth that beat most other nations, policy continuity and political stability have drawn foreign investors. Govt also implemented key reforms such as giving RBI an inflation-target mandate and steadily whittling down the size of its budget deficit. India now sits on top of the world's fourth-biggest pile of foreign reserves. RBI has been buying dollars when the rupee is strong and selling forex when it weakens to lean against big moves in the currency. By managing the supply of dollars available in India's currency market, RBI is able to smooth out shifts in the value of the rupee.Indian assets provide relatively high volatility-adjusted returns - better performance with more predictability - compared with other emerging markets. The local currency is proving more reliable than those of economies in Latin America or Africa that might show a stellar performance in one year and burn a hole in portfolios the next. But there are shortcomings to RBI's approach. Its firm grip means any changes in economic fundamentals may not always get fully reflected in the currency.JP Morgan's decision to add India's debt to its emerging-market index starting June 28 could bring fresh challenges for policymakers. Foreign investors have long been big buyers of Indian equities, but as they start to build a bigger presence in the bond market, it's an additional channel through which flows can buffet the rupee. Govt will also have to run a tight ship, keeping any fiscal profligacy in check to avoid a knee-jerk reaction from investors.","The rupee has gone from being one of Asia's most volatile currencies to among its most stable in the span of a decade.

It acknowledges the role of digital public infrastructure and govt involvement in India's success.""Many countries have tried to emulate the success of the two leading players: India's UPI and Brazil's Pix. However, the limited success of these efforts reveals that isolated implementations of point solutions for digital identity or real-time payment systems do not suffice to foster widespread adoption,"" said Karthik Ragupathy, head of strategy and investor relations at PhonePe, who was quoted in the report.India has recently introduced new notifications to clarify KYC and co-lending standards for fintechs.

Spectrum auction fetches over Rs 11,300 crore on Day 2

Telecom companies strategically bid in the recent spectrum auction to enhance 5G services rollout nationwide. The auction saw lower earnest money deposits, signaling a focused approach towards acquiring spectrum for improved connectivity and coverage. Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel, and Vodafone Idea actively participated in securing radio waves for high-speed mobile services.

Spectrum auction ends in just 2 days with bids worth Rs 11,340 crore

Participated in a recent two-day auction for radiowaves, falling short of the government's minimum value estimate. The event garnered bids totaling only Rs 11,340 crore for 10 GHz of spectrum. Previously, in a seven-day 2022 auction, over Rs 1.5 lakh crore worth of 5G spectrum was sold, with Jio emerging as the top bidder.

NEW DELHI: The latest spectrum auction to sell airwaves to mobile companies ended within two days, with Sunil Bharti Mittal’s Bharti Airtel buying nearly 60% of the Rs 11,341 crore that was sold.After seven rounds of bidding, just over a quarter or 141 Mhz spectrum of the 533 Mhz that was on offer could be sold with Bharti acquiring 97 Mhz across three bands, followed by Vodafone (30 Mhz) and Reliance Jio (14.4 Mhz)The auction revenue will be lower than govt’s estimated flow, although an over Rs 2 lakh crore dividend bonanza from RBI will more than make up for the shortfall. Govt had offered a total of 10 GHz of spectrum, ranging between 800 MHz to 26 GHz, which was worth Rs 96,238 crore at the base or auction start price. There were no takers for at least three of the frequencies on offer, generating 12% of the base price.Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea have successfully renewed their expired spectrum in 900 MHz and 1,800 MHz bands, and further an additional quantum of 87.2 MHz worth Rs 6,165 crore has been acquired by telcos to augment their services, DoT said in a statement.“Spectrum auction 2024 was part of a continuous allocation process that is transparent, robust and progressive. Telecom service providers (TSPs) have taken spectrum not only for continuity of service but for expanding their services but the volume is limited because already a large part of the spectrum required was auctioned only last year,” communications minister Jyotiraditya Scindia told reporters.In West Bengal and Bihar, bids went above the reserve price in the 1,800 MHz band. DoT statement suggested that the response was muted as most of the 5G spectrum required was auctioned in August 2022 and their monetisation is still in progress.Companies said they went about buying spectrum in a planned manner. “In this auction, we have bolstered our sub-giga hertz and mid-band holding, which will significantly improve our coverage especially indoor,” said Bharti Airtel MD & CEO Gopal Vittal, adding that the company is seeking to judiciously acquire the right amount of spectrum.","Spectrum auction ends in just 2 days with bids worth Rs 11,340 crore. No takers for at least three of the frequencies on offer, generating 12% of the base price. An over Rs 2 lakh crore dividend bonanza from RBI will more than make up for the shortfall.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111297626,imgsize-157606,width-400,resizemode-4/111297626.jpg"

While the engineering and construction business is grappling with a shortage of 25,000 labourers, its IT and IT-enabled services' unit is facing a crunch of 20,000 engineers.This has impacted the execution of the conglomerate's projects. L&T attributed the manpower shortage situation to extreme weather conditions, disruptions caused by elections, people moving abroad including to places like Russia and Israel for higher earnings, and demand for certain skill sets where those hands are not available. There is also a 10-12% attrition at L&T, said SNS, as Subrahmanyan is popularly known.L&T has been facing manpower shortages on and off . Last year, SNS had said the company faced challenges despite wanting to recruit over 30,000 labourers. He said the adverse weather events have led to changes in working hours in some projects wherein no work is happening during the afternoons except essential or critical works.The conglomerate is taking care of its employees by offering them transport facilities, health drinks and food at the sites. Besides, it has skill centres and other initiatives that can act as a mitigating factor.At any point of time, L&T engages over 4 lakh labourers with skills like carpentry and masonry, across its projects, said SNS. On the engineering side, the CMD said an attrition of over 10% makes it more challenging and this ensures that there is a shortage of over 14,000 engineers at any point of time. ""I think we would, at the moment, need about 20,000 people, including attrition... that is engineers,"" he said.L&T's labour crunch mirrors that of the infrastructure sector as well as the broader industry. Earlier this month, TeamLease said the semiconductor sector is expected to face a shortage of 2-3 lakh professionals by 2027.

Budget 2024 income tax expectations : Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is expected to present the first full Union Budget 2024 of the Modi 3.0 government in July. Like every year, salaried individuals are looking at FM Sitharaman to provide tax relief in the form of reduced tax rates, changed income tax slabs and even higher deductions.One such relief that is sought is to include more non-metro cities in the 50% House Rent Allowance (HRA) exemption list. HRA is a common component of employee compensation packages provided by many employers.Employees receiving HRA and paying rent for their accommodation can claim a tax exemption on the allowance under the old income tax regime. The exemption amount depends on whether the employee resides in a metro city or not for tax purposes. However, if an employee receiving HRA does not live in a rented house, the entire allowance becomes fully taxable.According to an ET report quoting Radhika Viswanathan, Executive Director at Deloitte Haskins & Sells LLP, the Income-tax Act, 1961, under Section 10(13A), provides tax exemption for HRA. The amount of HRA that can be claimed as tax exempt is the lowest of the following:1. Actual HRA received;2. Actual Rent paid minus 10% of basic salary;3. 50% of basic salary (for metro cities)/40% of basic salary (for non-metro cities).Also Read | Budget 2024 income tax expectations: Modi government may lower personal tax rates, says report - top 5 points Currently, rented houses in Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, and Chennai are eligible for a 50% exemption from HRA, while those in other locations fall under the 40% category. It is important to note that this classification was established over three decades ago, according to Viswanathan.As cities have expanded in terms of population and economic growth, it has become necessary to re-evaluate the way we define metro and non-metro cities.Interestingly, the Constitution (seventy-fourth Amendment) Act, 1992, also recognizes the National Capital Region (NCR), Bangalore, Pune, Hyderabad as metro cities. Despite this, the HRA tax exemption for salaried individuals in these cities remains at 40% due to outdated tax laws.Also Read | Standard deduction may rise under new tax regime Residing outside of metro cities can result in a higher proportion of one's income being paid in taxes. For instance, an individual living in Bengaluru may have to pay a higher average rent compared to someone residing in Kolkata or Chennai, which are classified as metro cities for tax purposes.Those living in rapidly developing non-metro cities, as defined by the Income-tax Act, may pay higher rents due to rapid urbanization. But, they receive lower tax benefits for house rent compared to metro cities. With an increasing number of people relocating to these non-metro cities for employment, it is crucial for the government to reassess the regulations for claiming rent exemptions to alleviate the financial strain on taxpayers, feel experts.",Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is expected to present the first full Union Budget 2024 of the Modi 3.0 government in July.

The sources told Reuters that a reduction in personal tax could boost consumption and increase savings for the middle class. The first source mentioned that individuals earning over Rs 15 lakh ($17,960.42) annually, up to a certain undetermined amount, may receive some tax relief.

The changes could be made to the new income tax regime introduced in 2020, where annual income up to Rs 15 lakh is taxed at rates between 5% and 20%, while earnings over Rs 15 lakh are taxed at 30%.

The second source pointed out that the personal tax rate increases six-fold when an individual's income rises from Rs 300,000 to Rs 15 lakh, which they described as ""quite steep.""

The government may also consider lowering personal tax rates for annual incomes of Rs 10 lakh, according to the first source. They added that a new threshold is being discussed for income taxed at the highest rate of 30% under the old tax system.

The second source noted that any loss of tax income to the government through tax cuts could be partially offset by increased consumption from this category of income earners.

The finance minister set the stage for a ""Viksit Bharat by 2047"", on the core principles of ‘Sabka Saath’, ‘Sabka Vikas’, ‘Sabka Vishwas’, with ‘Sabka Prayas’ being added as a new theme in the interim Budget.This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data i.e., farmer welfare and N for Nari utthan i.e., support for women entrepreneurs. These form the pillars of a comprehensive inclusive development. The Government's commitment to sustainable development under the strategy for Amrit Kaal includes achieving 'Net Zero' by 2070, rooftop solarization for one crore households and robust health initiatives.The Indian economy's resilience takes center stage amidst positive indicators of declining current account deficit as a percentage of GDP, falling unemployment rates, and a notable rise in digital transactions. These statistics affirm the robustness of the economy, showcasing a trajectory of growth and stability.The achievements in taxation reforms are nothing short of remarkable, with direct tax collections more than trebling in the last decade, the number of tax return filers increasing by 2.4 times, average processing time of tax returns plummeting from 93 days in FY 2013-14 to an impressive 10 days in FY 2023-24, resulting in issuance of quick refunds. These are the results of consistent progressive measures thus obviating the need for, and rightly avoiding, any last-minute populist measures.No change in existing tax rates, both for direct and indirect taxes, is a good indicator of stability and predictability for investors and taxpayers.A welcome move to waive outstanding tax demands that are minor, disputed, and unreconciled. This involves the withdrawal of outstanding direct tax demands up to Rs. 25,000 pertaining to the period up to FY 2009-10 and up to Rs.10,000 for FY 2010-11 to 2014-15.The Government's commitment to fostering a business-friendly environment is evident in its intent to extend specific tax benefits for start-ups, investments by sovereign wealth funds/ pension funds, and certain IFSC units. The extension has been made now until March 31, 2025. This might help in creating a conducive landscape for business.To align with the CBDT notification issued earlier, the provisions relating to tax collection at source concerning remittances under the Liberalized Remittance Scheme have now been formally incorporated in the Finance Bill, 2024, setting the rate at 20% for amounts exceeding Rs. 7 lakhs in a financial year.The Finance Bill, 2024 proposes an extension of the time limit for introducing the faceless scheme by the Central Government for transfer pricing proceedings, DRP Proceedings, and ITAT Proceedings, up to March 31, 2025.The interim Budget 2024 may not have proposed significant tax announcements, but it very well positioned the prelude to the full budget post the upcoming elections. Considering the potential impact on the population across the four pillars of GYAN, a sizable portion of India stands to be covered. The interim Budget’s focus on the tax front resembles a report card, highlighting the maturity achieved by our tax system. The enhancement of taxpayer services was emphasized as a key priority.","This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data and N for Nari utthan.

The Finance Minister on February 01, 2024, delivered a truly innovative interim budget. At first glance, it did not seem like an interim budget but looked more like the budget to drive further growth and a continuum of inclusive growth-oriented investments.At the outset, this budget brings a wonderful balance between fiscal prudence and continued investment for growth. It's not easy to continue the glide path of reducing the fiscal deficit and continuing to make significant investments in all areas including infrastructure, R&D, energy transition, technology, skilling, and social welfare. The surprising reduction in fiscal deficit of 5.8% as against the budgeted 5.9% for FY24 and the projection of 5.1% in FY25 with a clear focus on increasing investments was a huge positive.This was a budget for everyone and all because it caters to every part of the Indian economy and society. The FM has carefully catered to the investment needs of various sectors. The continued focus on youth, impoverished, women and farmers to increase their involvement and contribution to economic growth is evident. By committing an 11.1% increase in capital expenditure to 11,11,111 lakh crore, the FM has clearly brought every single 1 in this growth journey.What was very impressive was the inclusion strategy of the government. The focus on women's empowerment for the past few years is unprecedented, which is reflected in the inclusion of women in the workforce moving from 23.3% to 37% in the last five years. The thirty crore Mudra Yojna loans to women entrepreneurs were a great boost to the Nari Shakti initiative. We already have over 10 million Lakhpati Didis and what is truly evident is like a corporate CFO, the FM has revised the earlier target of 20 million Lakhpati Didis to 30 million. The government also plans to invest in initiatives to encourage young girls between the ages of 9 and 14 to undertake the vaccination for cervical cancer which is again a great boost to Nari Shakti.A lot needs to be done to bring more women into all parts of economic growth but the journey so far and the vision of the future is truly inspiring.While India continues on its technological prowess and makes its mark in new technologies like Artificial Intelligence, we need a multi-pronged strategy to harness the power of AI. We need a clear focus on building AI systems in India so that we not only emerge as a global leader in this new era but can build models, which are specific to India that will benefit Indians. At the same time, we need a very wide coverage program to build skills to leverage AI to its fullest potential. The biggest contribution we can make to the inclusion of youth in the economic development of the country is by skilling them in new skill areas. In the last few years, the Skill India Mission has trained 14 million youth, reskilled over 5 million youth and established a staggering 3,000 new ITIs. The future of any country will depend as much on capital investments as on skill investments.The focus on agricultural development and support to the farmer continues through direct financial assistance to farmers. The farmers have benefited by getting crop insurance through PM Fasal Bima Yojana. It's not just the farmers, the PM-SVANidhi provides credit assistance to a large number of street vendors.The last few years have seen the journey of affordable housing through Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY). There is a slight increase in allocation to launch a scheme for encouraging the middle class to build or buy new homes. This investment will likely propel a wider economic development and increase employment.India has seen a tremendous rise in entrepreneurship in the last few years. In order to continue the journey and promote new startups, the government proposes to extend certain tax benefits, which are expiring from March 2024 to March 2025. The MSMEs have not been left behind. With a proposal to provide timely finances to such enterprises, the government has paved the way for their growth, so they can look to compete globally.All in all, it’s a truly inclusive budget with a clear focus on development not just by giving away freebies but enabling the people to participate in the economic development activity. While the FM calls the comprehensive GDP - Governance, Development & Performance – to me, this budget is inclusive of another GDP – gender, demography, and professions.","Akhilesh Tuteja is Partner and Head, Clients and Markets, KPMG in India.

Suman Bery , who heads Niti Aayog , the govt think tank, is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China, which he says is also an opportunity for India. The economist is confident that Indian states remain resilient. Excerpts of the interview with TOI.The finance ministry expects the economy to grow 7% next year. Given the global situation, how do you see the prospects?The belief in the finance ministry is that we have a possible drag coming from the external sector but that we have other sources. We have enough domestic sources of demand. One has to applaud the political and economic judgment of FM in deciding that it was appropriate to pursue the path of fiscal consolidation. There is transparency. What this actually reflects is responsible economic management, which is one reason we are where we are. Second, it also creates a buffer so that there is policy space if we do encounter headwinds.That’s the hope and expectation. We have an independent central bank and an inflation targeting central bank, so it is up to the monetary policy committee to take a call through the monetary policy committee on the repo rate .The PM has said that when India grows its states grow. India is a composite of 37 states and UTs. They are each at very different points in their demographic transition. There are some states where the net replacement rate is down to 1%, like Kerala . There are others, particularly UP and Bihar, which are in their earliest stage of demographic transition and each one of these states is the size of a large European country. There are two implications of that — one is internal labour mobility and it will become an even larger part of our growth model. The govt has taken several steps to create a unified market. Our main endowment is our human capital and that has to be equipped to participate in global exchange in many ways. We know from China, Japan that the demographic dividend partly depends on markets and on human capital. But the golden period is fairly short lived, about 15 years, when the so called dependency ratio declines. The other big opportunity the PM has been highlighting is bringing women much more into the active labour force.When Niti was set up there was the idea of a three-year vision and a seven-year strategy paper. The reality is that schemes of govt tend to be aligned with the award of the Finance Commission . There are various established building blocks or hand holds which are already a matter of govt policy. The PM is much more interested in a national debate on what it means to be a Viksit Bharat or modern society. We have a collective goal and it is for the democratic polity to define what that goal should be. Its emphatically not for a super mandarin bureaucracy. It is not going to be Lee Kwan Yew’s Singapore led from the top.It’s entirely a finance ministry matter but I would be lying if I didn’t say when I visit certain states there is this complaint. A big frontier would be resource mobilisation at the state level. Second is going to be rationalisation of subsidies not only at the Union level, but also at the state level. All chief ministers sit on my governing council. When they convene as the governing council, I see them in their role as development practitioners. The world is beginning to appreciate quite how much institutional and political maturity India attained in our 75 years and the most fundamental dimension of a democracy, we have orderly transfers of power. There are enough buffers to ensure that what happens in state finances is unlikely to create macro instability. Those risks are well contained by our Constitution. The chief ministers know that they are going to be judged by development outcomes and so you can have the sugar rush of changing of pension plans or various handouts but if the cupboard is bare you are not going to be able to deliver.","Suman Bery is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China.

Government's Marathon to 2047: Emphasis on Fiscal Prudence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/governments-marathon-to-2047-emphasis-on-fiscal-prudence/articleshow/107371788.cms,"What was the thinking behind keeping the vote on account absolutely straight?

So is it the idea to keep the Budget completely transparent?

The capex has risen 11.1% and there is an emphasis on infrastructure spending. But there is also the hope that the private sector will now take over and start capital spending. Given the geopolitical situation, how confident is the govt that it will pan out as planned?

Finance secretary T V Somanathan, in an interview with TOI, says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047 . Excerpts:If you see the Budget speech you will see the emphasis on 2047. The govt has set its sight on running that marathon. Running to 2047 is a marathon , it’s not a sprint. If you are going to run a marathon, you need to be in good shape and you can’t have short-term stimulants or something that will get you some yards and then it’s done.The whole focus is on making India a developed country by 2047, for which a healthy present and a strong fiscal position is an important concomitant. Some purely short term measures don’t really fit into that picture. It’s a consistent picture: focus on the long term for which you need to build strength in the short term and that needs to be done by prudence in fiscal policy and by not doing things which can detract you from that path. Not doing the wrong thing is more important than appearing to do things.The idea is that govt finances may be good, bad or indifferent depending on the times, depending on the circumstances, depending on the policies. But what is the position should be reflected as reasonably and accurately as possible. That is an emphasis. As regards the Finance Commission, again the terms of reference that have been given to them are the terms in the Constitution.What is the means by which the devolution should be done is a matter they have full discretion. They can actually take all kinds of factors into account and in a sense we felt this time based on my review of the previous commissions that the right expression would be less is more. The shorter, less prescriptive terms of reference gives full scope for all stakeholders including state govts to express their viewpoints and for the commission to take a balanced view of the different perspectives and then come to its award. Ultimately the award of the Finance Commission is about devolution and grant for which full scope has now been given to them.n There are incipient signs of private capital expenditure accelerating. There are some surveys I have seen done by some of the chambers industry, which show high levels of investment. The PMI, which is a sort of leading indicator, is also looking pretty healthy. Capacity utilisation is one reason that private sector capital expenditure doesn’t immediately pick up when the economy starts accelerating because there is surplus capacity.But increasingly I get the sense that many industries are beginning to reach levels where they have to add capacity. When that happens capital investment will happen. Another pointer also mentioned in the Budget speech you may notice that our airlines have placed large orders for planes — that is capital expenditure.When you import 1,000 aircraft, it’s just not 1,000 aircraft, there are concomitant additions to ground handling facilities, you need airports to expand, you need to employ people to do that. That means a lot of jobs. The aircraft is capital but then look at the effect it is going to have on skilled jobs. So capital expenditure is happening. I am fairly confident that we will have decent capital expenditure in the year to come and that will become a new source of acceleration.",Finance secretary T V Somanathan says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047. The capex has risen 11.1% and there is an emphasis on infrastructure spending. There are incipient signs of private capital expenditure accelerating.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-107371891,imgsize-720422,width-400,resizemode-4/107371891.jpg"

According to a research report from a prominent stock exchange bank, the total market capitalisation of the major US-based Bitcoin mining companies recently reached a new all-time high, suggesting growing investor interest and capital inflows in the Bitcoin mining sector.Meanwhile, investors continue to express bullish sentiments about an emerging meme cryptocurrency called Raboo ($RABT) as it keeps edging closer towards a notable presale milestone, which is raising $2 million from the sale of its native tokens. Here’s more about investors' interest in the mining companies as well as the force driving the new presale crypto toward incredible heights.Following the Bitcoin halving event in April 2024, the market capitalisation of major US Bitcoin mining companies has been increasing. The increase persisted till June 15th, when the total market capitalisation of the mining companies reached a new all-time high of $22.8 billionInterestingly, analysts claim the growth of Bitcoin mining companies outperformed BTC’s price growth, hinting at investors’ belief that investing in the mining sector could be more profitable than holding BTC.Although Bitcoin's price is currently at $64,700, it has been down 2.7% over the past week. Amid the notable achievements of its mining companies, experts remain optimistic about the cryptocurrency, believing that its downtrend may not persist long-term.Investors are continually captivated by this promising meme coin project called Raboo, which keeps displaying remarkable growth by raising over $1.8 million from the sale of its presale tokens. As a project that allows its investors to earn passive income by simply posting quality memes on social media, Raboo has positioned itself not only for more milestones but also to become one of the most desirable presale tokens in the meme coin space.One of the factors that has attracted investors to Raboo is its strategic token burn mechanism, which aims to maintain token scarcity by constantly removing tokens from circulation so that the value of $RABT can easily increase. Remarkably, Raboo also plans to implement a zero buy-and-sell tax structure, an innovative approach that ensures smooth and frictionless transactions, allowing investors to maximise their returns without the burden of excessive fees.Raboo currently sells its presale tokens at just $0.0048 in Stage 4 of the presale; numerous investors are buying into this new meme coin sensation. This is because the token also boasts of a potential surge in demand and value that could potentially reach 100-fold after it enters the market.The total market capitalization of the US based Bitcoin mining companies reaching a new all-time high, implies that more people now prefer mining Bitcoin than just holding its tokens.Meanwhile, Raboo is expected to attract more investors to take part in its presale especially when it reaches the $2 million milestone. The platform's strategic token burn mechanism and plans for a zero buy-and-sell tax structure is also expected to heightened its appeal, making it a presale crypto with further upside potential.Telegram channel: Telegram: https://t.me/RabootokenPortal Twitter handle: Twitter: https://twitter.com/Raboo_Official",Raboo ($RABT) is raising $2 million from the sale of its native tokens.

Meanwhile, Injective (INJ) drops signal challenges ahead, with an increase in network activity that may not offset the downward trend.Amid these contrasting scenarios, BlockDAG announces a $2 million giveaway, intensifying its claim as one of the top bullish crypto . With over $53.2 million raised in its presale and strategic global campaigns, BlockDAG is poised to redefine the blockchain landscape.XRP is currently testing the $0.5 mark, having recently approached this key price level only to pull back swiftly. Despite this fluctuation, the overall market sentiment around XRP might appear weak; however, underlying strengths suggest resilience. The MACD indicator, a gauge of market momentum, shows a bullish crossover.Further insights into the XRP price forecast indicate sustained interest at this critical half-dollar juncture. Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) positions XRP within a neutral range, hinting at balanced market conditions. This stability could be a precursor to future movements, keeping the XRP price forecast cautiously optimistic yet grounded in recent market behaviour.Despite a notable increase in network activity, Injective (INJ) drops have caught the attention of market watchers. Last week, a 41% rise in daily active addresses on the injective network was observed. Similarly, the surge in new addresses, up by 57%, suggests a rising interest in trading INJ despite its declining market value.Further analysis reveals that the uptick in the network activity, particularly the 1500% increase in large transaction volumes last month, may be a double-edged sword. Current technical indicators, like the Directional Movement Index and the Aroon Down Line, support a strong bearish outlook, hinting that the Injective (INJ) drops may continue before stabilising.BlockDAG's innovative $2 million giveaway marks a significant step in its mission to engage and expand its community. Participants eager to get involved need to hold at least $100 worth of BDAG coins purchased during the presale. Community members can increase their odds of winning by accomplishing various tasks and referring friends.

BlockDAG has successfully raised over $53.2 million through 18 presale batches, reflecting growing investor confidence and interest. The strategic placements and aggressive marketing have boosted visibility and significantly propelled presale momentum.Experts are now eyeing BlockDAG as a potential market leader with predictions of a 30,000x return on investment.
