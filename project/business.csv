US Consumer Prices and Rate Cut Expectations

Oil Prices Decline

Global Market Rally

FII Inflows and Market Sentiment

Possible Rate Cut in India and Its Impact

Stock market today : BSE Sensex and Nifty50, the Indian equity benchmark indices, skyrocketed to lifetime highs in a matter of a few minutes on Thursday. While the BSE Sensex crossed the 83,000 mark for the first time, Nifty50 too went above 25,400 in a first. BSE Sensex ended the day at 82,962.71, up 1,440 points or 1.77%. Nifty50 closed the day at 25,388.90, up 470 points or 1.89%.BSE Sensex and Nifty50 surged over 1.5% to reach new all-time highs, mirroring gains in global markets .The likelihood of increased foreign inflows into Indian equities strengthened following the release of US inflation data, which raised the probability of a 25 basis point rate cut by the US Federal Reserve.The market capitalization of all listed companies on the BSE increased by Rs 6.6 lakh crore, reaching Rs 467.36 lakh crore, according to an ET report.Data showed a slight increase in US consumer prices in August, but underlying inflation exhibited some persistence. This development increased the chances of a 25-basis-point Fed rate cut on September 18 to 85% from 66%, while the likelihood of a larger 50-bps reduction decreased to 15% from 34%, according to CME FedWatch.IT companies, which generate a significant portion of their revenue from the US, experienced a 1% increase. Moreover, the Nifty Bank, Auto, Financial Services, Healthcare, and Oil & Gas sectors all witnessed gains exceeding 1%.Bharti Airtel, Reliance Industries, HDFC Bank, and Infosys collectively contributed nearly 500 points to the Sensex rally. Other significant contributors to the index's gain included L&T, M&M, NTPC, ICICI Bank, and SBI.Bharti Airtel shares experienced a surge of nearly 5% on Thursday, hitting their 52-week high of Rs 1,650.75 on the NSE. The stock played a role in propelling the BSE Sensex to its record high of 82,774.9. Over the past four trading sessions, the stock has remained undefeated, rallying by almost 7%.According to Narendra Solanki, Head Fundamental Research - Investment Services, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers, this is a much needed sentiment boost for the markets.“Indian markets opened in green on back of positive Asian markets buoyed by a tech-fueled rally on Wall Street overnight during the afternoon session markets further gained in strength and traded sharply higher as traders preferred to buy large cap stocks. The markets further gained strength on news of China cutting rates by 50 bps on $5 trillion mortgages as soon as this month to boost consumption came out ahead of a European Central Bank (ECB) policy meeting later in the day; providing much needed sentimental boost to the markets,” he said.Several key factors contributed to today's rally, including rate cut optimism, a decline in oil prices below $72 per barrel, a global market rally lifting sentiment, a weaker dollar index, an increase in FII inflows, and the possibility of a rate cut in India.The slight increase in US consumer prices in August, with core inflation rising by 0.28%, has led to a shift in market expectations regarding the Federal Reserve's upcoming rate decision. Despite the increase surpassing the expected 0.2%, the chances of a 25-basis-point rate cut on September 18 have jumped to 85%, while the likelihood of a more aggressive 50-bps cut has dropped to 15%. Experts suggest that the Fed is likely to be cautious due to the persistently high core inflation at 3.2%, ultimately settling for a 25bp rate cut.September has witnessed a significant drop in oil prices, with a decline of over 10% due to weak Chinese demand and concerns about global oversupply. This decline is positive for Indian equities, as India heavily relies on crude oil imports. Lower oil costs help ease inflationary pressures and improve corporate margins, contributing to the recent market rise in India.Indian equities have rallied in sync with global markets, mirroring the uptrend seen in Asia and Europe. The tech rally on Wall Street, unexpected US core inflation data, and anticipation of another ECB rate cut have all contributed to the positive sentiment in global markets. The weakening of the dollar index below the 102 level has also made emerging market assets more attractive to foreign investors.Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have been consistently buying equities since June, infusing nearly Rs 17,016 crore into domestic equities in September alone. This steady inflow has bolstered market sentiment and contributed to the positive momentum in the Indian market. The reversal of earlier outflows seen in April-May reflects the confidence of foreign investors in the resilience of India's economy.Analysts expect India's consumer price index (CPI)-based inflation to ease to between 3.2% and 4% for August, continuing the trend of falling inflation observed in recent months. This benign inflation condition and the prospects for rate cuts by the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) in 2024 are seen as positives for the Indian stock market.","BSE Sensex and Nifty50 surged over 1.5% to reach new all-time highs, mirroring gains in global markets.

It has to remain vigilant to prevent spillovers or second round effects from persistent food inflation and preserve the gains made so far in monetary policy credibility,” said RBI governor Shaktikanta Das in the August Monetary Policy review.","The food inflation rate for August 2024, based on the All India Consumer Food Price Index (CFPI), is provisionally reported at 5.66%.

Fixed deposit rates above 8%: Several small finance banks (SFBs) have increased their fixed deposit rates to over 8% for a two-year tenure as they compete with larger banks like State Bank of India and HDFC Bank to attract funds from regular savers in a market where alternative investment options have grown in recent years.SFBs are providing 100-125 basis points more on deposits compared to a year ago, which is also about 120 basis points higher than what major banks such as SBI and HDFC Bank are offering.According to an ET report, Utkarsh SFB and Suryoday SFB are offering 8.5% on two-three year tenures, while Equitas SFB is offering 8.5% on a tenure of two years to less than three years.

With deposits lagging, borrowings like infrastructure bonds have suddenly picked up.""India's financial market is imbalanced due to the opposing trends in the demand for and availability of funds, which an economist attributed to the RBI's strict monetary policy aimed at reducing inflation to the legally required 4%.Moreover, the attractive returns offered by growth assets have contributed to the democratization of India's equity culture, diverting funds from traditional bank deposits to pooled assets like various mutual funds and exchange-traded funds.",SFBs are providing 100-125 basis points more on deposits compared to a year ago.

Source: ET quoting Paisabazaar for interest rates data as on August 14, 2024.

Highest Fixed Deposit Interest Rates: Fixed deposits (FDs) offered by banks are secure and interest-generating investment options. With FDs, you can expect a guaranteed return on your invested funds, which remain unaffected by market fluctuations. This is the reason that FDs are a go to investment option for most risk averse investors.Interest rates for fixed deposits are near all time highs, with RBI pausing the rate cycle for several monetary policy meetings now.Investors have the flexibility to choose between the re-investment deposit option, which allows for the accumulation of compound interest, or the option to receive interest payments at regular intervals (monthly/quarterly) to support their financial planning and budgeting needs, notes an ET report.The interest rates offered on fixed deposits in August 2024 can vary based on several factors, including the specific bank, the age of the depositor, the tenure of the deposit, and the amount invested.In India, private banks are financial institutions where private companies or individuals hold the majority of the equity, in contrast to public-sector banks where the government is the primary shareholder.Public Sector Undertaking (PSU) banks are ones where the government owns the majority of the shares. These banks receive government subsidies with the aim of facilitating their growth and expansion.For investors interested in comparing fixed deposit interest rates between private and public sector banks, a brief analysis of the fixed deposit rates offered to both general citizens and senior citizens is provided below.","Public Banks: Latest Fixed Deposit Interest Rates For General Citizens. Private Banks: Highest Fixed Deposit interest rates for General Citizens and Private Banks. PSU Bank Fixed Deposit Rates: Highest slab, lowest slab, 1-year, 3-year and 5-year tenure.

Infra lending faces high risk: RBI,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/infra-lending-faces-high-risk-rbi/articleshow/113303086.cms,"MUMBAI: RBI deputy governor M Rajeshwar Rao has said that infrastructure projects face high risks, complicating their financing. He called for a unified approach to infrastructure development, where projects are viewed as part of a larger, connected system rather than as separate efforts.The governor's statement comes at a time when RBI has proposed new norms requiring banks to set aside an additional provision of 5% of the loan amount, compared to the current requirement of 0.4%.The new rule, if implemented, would make project financing much more expensive. The deputy governor was speaking at an infrastructure seminar organised by the National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development ( NaBFID ).""High sunk costs, coupled with long gestation periods, further complicate the financing of infrastructure projects and lead to asset-liability mismatches. Delays in approvals, clearances, land acquisition challenges, and breaches of agreements also add to the risks of project financing and cause further issues like cost overruns,"" Rao said. He noted that infrastructure projects depend on each other, making financing complex. Delays or issues in one project can affect others, so success relies on well-coordinated planning and execution.Rao added that over the medium term, NaBFID should plan for self-sustainable operations and not rely on ""continuous govt support"" or regulatory dispensations. Speaking at the event, M Nagaraju from the department of financial services said that India currently spends 8-10% of its GDP on infrastructure, with three-fourths of that being govt expenditure. ""This should change with greater participation by the private sector, and govt will create the necessary ecosystem,"" he said.According to K V Kamath, chairman of NaBFID, RBI's norms aim to prepare lenders for international standards. ""We have to prepare for what the West is doing... for instance, provisions for expected credit losses. This (project finance provisions) is nothing compared to what the ECL provisions will cost,"" Kamath said.","RBI deputy governor M Rajeshwar Rao has said that infrastructure projects face high risks, complicating their financing.

Railway Budget 2024 : The government has wavered little in its efforts to spur a modernisation of railways in the country, pivoting on technology, to support the country’s economic ambitions. In line with expectations, Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore, marking yet another year of successive increase in outlay.That takes forward the past policies and the government’s vision, which have paved the way for modernisation of the transport behemoth.In earlier decades, the government had focused on laying tracks on new routes, electrification and incremental rolling stock capacity addition. That was the need of the hour back then and has helped set up the base for a larger transformation.For instance, the massive Dedicated Freight Corridor ( DFC ) as well as locomotive factories at Marhaura and Madhepura in Bihar were conceptualised over a decade ago and we are seeing their completion now.More recently, the focus has shifted to modernisation—of rolling stock and safety systems, among other aspects.This year, emphasis has also been laid on the railways’ crucial role in industrial development. Commodity-specific corridors have been planned in eastern India and impetus given to port connectivity. Vande Bharat and technology-led upgrades in rolling stock remain in focus. Safety has been prioritised through budgetary allocations for the anti-collision systemKavach . That said, there are other cogs in the wheel that demand attention from a long-term perspective.First, the target for the Operating Ratio, the crucial efficiency gauge, has been set at 98.22% for 2024-25, compared with 98.65% in 2023-24. This reflects an imminent need for operational transformation. An effective overhaul of the world’s fourth-largest rail network will take many years and thus we need to start focusing on improving efficiency and reducing costs now.DFC is almost entirely operational and will be complete over the next few months. To ensure the project achieves its twin goals of reducing logistics costs and enhancing freight efficiency, railways need to attract more cargo on the corridor. This will help increase the rail coefficient and make the railways’ approach more market-oriented, which will in turn aid future corridors.A revamp of railway stations is on track, with sufficient funds dedicated to this end. But even though new coaches and wagons are increasingly being added to meet footfalls, the stations and passenger trains themselves remain synonymous with chaos.Just as safety, comfort and convenience have been prioritised, there is a need for solutions to address the capacity and demand challenges. As a first step, the government could target development of new stations and setting up of new coach production units.As a leading freight mover, Indian Railways carried a record 1,588 MT cargo in fiscal 2024, up from 1,095 MT in fiscal 2015. It accounts for 26% of the cargo moved in the country—by no means an easy feat. The railways aims to take this volume to 3,000 MT by 2030, which would require a 11% CAGR against the around 4.2% witnessed over the last 10 years. As per a report by TERI and Shakti Foundation, from carrying about 62% of freight traffic in 1990-91, Indian Railways’ share has declined to ~27% in 2014-15. This has been due to the expanding road network, cost competitiveness over railways, and door-to-door service. Thus, commencing the cycle of increasing the rail share again is commendable.DFCs, a high-capacity track network, high-power locomotives and improvement in wagon designs have set the ball rolling for larger capacity, faster freight trains that deliver better efficiency.Yet, achieving exponential growth is a tall ask given the current dynamics. Possibly, similar challenges might apply to other goals the railways might have for 2047.To be fair, despite its scale and complexity, Indian Railways has been able to achieve diverse developments at commendable speed.But the track ahead is long and it is time to start discussing the reinvention of the institutional set-up.Indian Railways sees substantial private sector involvement in the form of vendors and contractors. Policymakers could start mulling extreme options such as parallel privately-owned and operated railway infrastructure, coupled with centralised planning and an evolved role for the railways. This will need a robust policy framework from the Government of India.The time is perhaps also ripe to bring user charge and asset monetisation-driven segments for passengers as well as cargo to the discussion table. Globally, the separation of infrastructure and operations in railways has delivered mixed results, for example in the United Kingdom. The model should be analysed and revisited to understand its potential relevance in the Indian context.The key would be to retrace our steps and align our long-term goals to identify not just incremental changes but also ways to explore bold and path-breaking alternatives that put Indian Railways on a smooth track and bring it up to speed.","Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore.

Budget 2024 capital gains tax changes: The Narendra Modi government is considering suggestions for tweaks in the new long term capital gains tax regime that was announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman in Union Budget 2024.The July 23 budget reduced the LTCG tax on property from 20% to 12.5%. The indexation benefit, which allowed taxpayers to adjust the acquisition cost for inflation before calculating capital gains and thus reduce their tax liability, is proposed to be eliminated for properties purchased on or after April 1, 2001.The government publishes the Cost Inflation Index (CII) annually for this calculation.India Inc is appealing to the government for a gradual shift to the long-term capital gains tax regime proposed in the FY25 budget, which aims to eliminate indexation benefits for property, gold, and other unlisted assets.According to an ET report by Deepshikha Sikarwar, the industry is suggesting alternatives such as a higher tax rate with indexation or a lower rate of 12.5% without indexation, as well as some form of grandfathering for ancestral properties.The finance ministry is currently reviewing these proposals and will discuss them with the Prime Minister's Office. The final decision will be made closer to the date when the Finance Bill reply is to be presented in Parliament, the reports said.Industry groups are expected to submit formal proposals to the finance ministry in the near future.

Budget 2024 for manufacturing sector : The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth. While the middle class has been offered tax relief, the government's primary focus remains on judicious spending to maximize economic impact. The budget's core themes are employment, skilling, MSME development, and support for the middle class.Largely focus has remained intact on spending money judiciously to ensure that each penny spent creates a ripple effect in the entire economic landscape.Although at first glance, manufacturing might appear to have taken a backseat, a deeper analysis reveals a multifaceted approach to bolstering the sector. Initiatives like employment-linked benefits and internship programs, while primarily aimed at job creation and skill development, indirectly benefit manufacturing companies by expanding the talent pool.Extensive focus on the MSME manufacturing units by way of extending term loan facility for purchase of machinery and equipment without collateral or third-party guarantee, would help companies in augmenting their capital base/ capacity and strengthen the very foundation of the manufacturing ecosystem in the country. Development of a new credit-assessment model by Public Sector Banks to assess MSME credit shall provide much needed regulatory relief to the units.With respect to the large manufacturing entities, while there is no direct fiscal/ tax incentive introduced in this budget, some support has been provided with an extensive focus on development of ‘industrial parks’ in nearly 100 cities under the ‘plug and play’ model. Reforms proposed with respect to land administration, planning and management, shall also ease out acquisition related difficulties often faced by entrepreneurs/ business houses in acquiring lands for manufacturing set-ups.Targeted Customs duty interventions like, rationalization of Customs duty provisions in Mobile phone manufacturing setups, extension of Customs duty exemption on import of capital goods for manufacturing of solar cells and panels, full Customs duty exemption on import of 25 critical minerals,, shall provide the required impetus for enhancing domestic manufacturing environment.Governments’ focus on formulating an Economic Policy Framework to set the scope for next-gen reforms in the country, has a target to improve the productivity of factors of production, namely, land, labour, capital, entrepreneurship and technology. This shall pave the way for enabling achievement of a target of 25% manufacturing sector contribution to the nation’s GDP over the course of next 7-10 years.While the overall outlook is positive, the extension of tax benefits under Section 115BAB for manufacturing entities and the absence of new PLI schemes are notable omissions.The country’s manufacturing base is expanding as is reflective from the continuously increasing tax collections and expanding Purchasing Manager’s Index. It would be pertinent to see how the ground realities evolve vis-à-vis the vision envisaged, in the upcoming Financial Year.","The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth.

Budget 2024: Armed with the vision to propel India to become a developed country by 2047, the Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business thereby providing the required stimulus to the manufacturing sector and enabling large scale job creation.On the Indirect tax front, the industry welcomes the much-needed announcement for a comprehensive review of the rate structure under Customs enabling ease in product classification and dispute reduction.The proposal of lowering of Customs duty on a plethora of raw materials and products including solar cells, critical minerals and bullion are encouraging measures. The rationale behind such reduction clearly indicates support towards domestic manufacturing, deepening value addition and supporting targets in reducing carbon footprint.Relevant amendments under the Customs law have been made to provide increased time limits for re-imports and re-exports to enhance competitiveness of the fledgling MRO sector. The government has extended significant duty reduction and exemption benefits to the healthcare and electronics sectors, continuing the impetus of incentives provided under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme.Since their introduction in March 2020, the PLI schemes have indeed supported in revitalizing the manufacturing sector and strengthening the necessary supply chains. The success achieved in the mobile manufacturing sector has now enabled the Government to reduce customs duties on mobile phones and components, signalling a mature environment. The Budget proposals aim at reproducing similar outcomes for semiconductor and pharmaceutical industry by increasing the budgetary allocation.Buoyed by the increasing revenue collection under GST signalling a shift towards a mature tax regime, this Budget has harmonized the timeframes for the issuance of demand notices and adjudication orders for cases involving fraud, suppression or otherwise. Significant amendments to the GST legislations have been introduced reflecting the recommendations proposed by the GST Council such as regularizing non-levy of GST due to general practice which may turn out to be a breather for certain impacted industries reeling under huge tax demands.The Insurance sector has been provided much relief through the GST council recommendations which have been cemented in the present budget thereby ending long standing disputes on their business practices.The Government's efforts to push forward with its reform agenda are evident as plans to incentivize states for their business reform actions plans and digitalization through the Jan Vishwas Bill 2.0 is proposed. Further, setting up of e-commerce export hubs is envisaged to facilitate easier access to international markets for domestic players.The recent implementation of Budget proposals allows the government to maintain momentum in its reform agenda. These policy measures implicitly reaffirm the significance of India Inc as a crucial element in the development of infrastructure.

Budget 2024 : Real estate, a significant contributor to employment generation, has received a fair bit of attention in Budget 2024-25. Recent years have seen the sector transform rapidly, driven by factors such as favourable government policies, Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, strong economic growth and changing consumer preferences.Added to that, the budgetary focus on job creation, skilling and employment-linked incentives, infrastructure, urban development, rural connectivity, digitalisation and land-related norms, all dovetail to promote growth of the sector.Launched in June 2015, the PMAY aims to provide affordable housing to all eligible beneficiaries. The budget unveiled PMAY Urban 2.0, under which the housing needs of 1 crore urban poor and middle class will be addressed with an investment of Rs 10 lakh crore.The central government’s additional Rs 2.2 lakh crore injection in the next 5 years to make housing more affordable has the potential to revitalise the affordable housing market.Such an approach can play an important role in realising the government's vision of Housing for All and push growth and development. Hence, the significant investment under PMAY Urban 2.0 is expected to alleviate urban housing deficits, spurring construction and economic growth.Steps to introduce technological reforms within the regulatory framework for land, such as digitalisation or GIS mapping of land records, will improve transparency.Rationalisation of stamp duty across states will also be critical to bring in uniformity and initiate land-related reforms such as urban planning, usage and building bylaws.These are steps in the right direction and will boost growth. Moreover, they will improve the ease of property transactions and strengthen municipal finances through increased property taxes. Rationalization of stamp duty with an emphasis on women homebuyers may boost home-buyer sentiment in major cities, too.The budget has also given ample attention to urban and rural development, with rental housing for industrial workers through the public private partnership model, interest subsidies for rental housing, and transit-oriented developments.The proposal to develop investment-ready plug-and-play industrial parks in 100 cities may attract industrial investment, leading to increased demand for industrial real estate and support the growth of ancillary services and residential developments in these regions.Initiatives for industrial parks and rental housing for industrial workers align with the country’s manufacturing goals and addresses worker accommodation needs.These steps are expected to promote industrial growth and stability in labour-intensive sectors, while also creating new opportunities for real estate developers specialising in rental and affordable housing.The changes in long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax, however, have evoked a mixed reaction. The government lowered the long-term capital gains tax from 20% to 12.5%, which is a welcome step. However, this came with the removal of the indexation benefit.The changes could encourage more liquidity in property transactions and potentially increase the effective tax burden depending on the property’s acquisition date.The launch of Phase IV of the PM Gram Sadak Yojana in 25,000 rural habitations will improve connectivity in rural areas, promoting rural development and making these regions more accessible for investment. The primary objective of PMGSY is to build robust, all-weather roads in rural habitations.

New Budget 2024 rule: Why Income Tax Department is likely to issue a huge number of tax notices this month,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-budget-2024-rule-why-income-tax-department-is-likely-to-issue-a-huge-number-of-tax-notices-this-month/articleshow/112186079.cms,"Taxing Times

Income Tax Notice on the way? The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month, as there are concerns that many taxpayers might escape the tax net due to the impending implementation of the new reassessment law on September 1, 2024.According to the amended regulation announced in Budget 2024 , the tax authorities can only go back a maximum of five years to reassess a taxpayer's records if the escaped income is at least Rs 50 lakh, and three years for an amount less than Rs 50 lakh.Previously, they could reassess cases up to 10 years old.According to an ET report, tax officials are now faced with the challenge of compiling and corroborating data on tax and income mismatches for the financial years 2013-14 to 2017-18 within the next few weeks, as these years will become time-barred for reassessment from September 1, 2024.The I-T department relies on information from various sources, such as banks, property registrars, and search findings from the investigation wing, to build reassessment cases.A tax officers' body has raised concerns about the feasibility of issuing notices under Section 148 (or 148A) in a large number of cases within a single month, given the overburdened nature of the jurisdictional assessing officers and the time-consuming process of obtaining sanction from the chief commissioner, who is the specified authority for such notices.Moreover, the law provides taxpayers with the right to explain their position before reassessment orders are finalized, a process that most believe cannot be completed by the end of August.Also Read | ITR refund status for FY 2023-24: How to check income tax refund status online - here’s a step-by-step guide for incometax.gov.in & NSDL websites The Central Board of Direct Taxes ( CBDT ) has been urged by its officers to postpone the effective date of the proposed amendment. However, this suggestion is unlikely to be well-received by corporations and high net worth individuals.""Capping the reassessment period at five years was a great decision as it would reduce hassles and litigation. But if the department fears there could be a genuine loss of revenue as it may not be possible to wrap up several matters by August 31, the government can think of strict parameters where time-bound cases can be selectively reopened - based on trails of steps taken in identifying escaped income,"" said Mitil Chokshi, partner at CA firm Chokshi & Chokshi.""Taxpayers may expect a rush of reassessment notices in August 2024. These notices are likely to be for the AYs 2018-19 and prior to that. It is pertinent to note that the Bombay High Court in a recent ruling in a case of Hexaware Technologies has taken a view on a proviso introduced in 2021, which can be interpreted to mean that AY 2017-18 (and prior years) got time barred on March 31, 2024. These reassessment notices (for AYs 2017-18 and prior) are likely to rake up new interpretation issues in the already muddled reassessment provisions,"" said Ashish Mehta, partner at law firm Khaitan & Co.The current situation is similar to the conflict between the Income Tax office and taxpayers in 2021. The reassessment law was amended in April 2021, allowing the tax office to reopen 10-year-old tax returns if the total undisclosed income exceeded Rs 50 lakh and reassess 4-year-old matters if the amount was less than Rs 50 lakh.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? However, this change led to over 10,000 writ petitions being filed by companies, arguing that they were not given sufficient time to explain and that the notices were issued without considering the carve-out that cases which couldn't be reopened earlier couldn't be reassessed under the new law.The Supreme Court invoked its extraordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution on May 4, 2022, to uphold all reassessment notices issued after March 31, 2021. However, the court left room for judicial proceedings based on the merits of each case, and several such matters are currently pending before the court.","The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month.

Are NPS Vatsalya & hiked NPS deduction limit for private sector employees good moves from Budget 2024?

NPS and EPF: Overlapping services

What is NPS Vatsalaya?

Latest NPS rules, news: In the Union Budget 2024 speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced two new initiatives with regard to National Pension Scheme (NPS) - extension of NPS 14% employer contribution benefits to private setcor and the intended launch of NPS Vatsalya.Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries, bringing it at par with the provisions available for government employees.Sriram Iyer, CEO, HDFC Pension Management told ET that with this move the “ground rules have been harmonised among government and non-government employees, which is a positive step.”Effectively, this means that now, private-sector employees can choose to reduce the taxable portion of employers’ contribution to their NPS corpus, thereby paying less tax and leaving greater funds in their pension deposits.“Employees will benefit from tax savings . More importantly, the 40% increase in contribution will have a significant impact on the terminal value of the retirement corpus,” remarked Iyer. The extended savings will “help in retirement planning, working as an option that is at par with the Provident Fund,” Dinesh Rohira, CEO & Founder, 5nance.com was quoted as saying.Moreover, the endeavour aims to increase NPS penetration by increasing tax incentives for the private sector, providing them a social security-cushion post-retirement.The scheme’s motive to widen the NPS subscriber base may not prove to be flawlessly effective, however. This is explained by Agrees Mrin Agarwal, Founder, Finsafe India: “While it’s good that the limit has been raised, it may not increase adoption as employees need to be educated in a big way. Also, the benefit is only for the salaried opting for the new tax regime,” she says.The mandatory contribution to the EPF, too, threatens to relegate the provisions of NPS under the umbrella of near-superfluity. This sentiment is echoed by Varun Sahay, a software engineer in a Delhi-based IT company: “When 12% of my salary is already deducted for the EPF, why should I put in more in the NPS and cut my take-home pay?”Rohira feels otherwise. “There’s no competition between the NPS and EPF as employees can contribute to both and build a 3-4 times bigger corpus while earning 3-4% higher returns via marketlinked options in the NPS,” he counters.Also Check | New Tax Regime 2023 vs 2024 After Budget: How Much Income Tax Will Salaried Taxpayers Save & How Do New Tax Slabs Compare To Old Regime? Top 10 Points You Must Know To jumpstart retirement savings for children, a new initiative called NPS Vatsalya has been unveiled in the Budget. This scheme allows parents and guardians to contribute to a minor's account, which can be converted into a regular NPS account once the child reaches adulthood.""It provides a very long duration for reaping the compounding benefits and accumulating a huge bounty at a later age. This can be a good way to plan a better future for kids who may not opt for a service segment in the future,"" says Rohira. Sriram Iyer agrees, stating, ""It’s a good move to help the child start his retirement journey. Even if a parent starts when the child is 10 years old, by the time he starts working, it can be a solid foundation for the compounding journey after that.""However, some experts question the utility of a product with such a long lock-in period, especially when parents cannot use the funds for essential goals like their child’s education amidst soaring education costs of 11-12%.""Parents are struggling to save for their own retirement, so it might be a bit of a stretch to expect them to save for their kids’ retirement. The need of the hour is a market-linked product that allows withdrawals only for the child’s education,"" says Mrin Agarwal, Founder of Finsafe India.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? Though the NPS permits partial withdrawals, it allows only 25% of the corpus after three years of joining, and this can be done only three times during the entire tenure. A premature exit before 60 years with 100% withdrawal is only possible if the corpus is less than Rs.2.5 lakh, an amount insufficient for most children's goals.""In its current form, there won’t be any uptake,"" asserts Agarwal. Rohira concurs, ""It’s a vanilla product with a lock-in, which does not make it very attractive and it may not take off. However, the government may optimise it and introduce new features later."" Iyer adds, ""This is just a start and there may be more subscriber-friendly features as we take it to the market. The regulator is proactive and open to feedback.""","Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries.

Gold import duty cut: Why Indians may not find buying gold from Dubai as attractive post Budget 2024,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-import-duty-cut-why-indians-may-not-find-buying-gold-from-dubai-as-attractive-post-budget-2024/articleshow/112097671.cms,"Gold import duty cut in Budget 2024: The recent reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai. Indian jewellers with stores in both India and the UAE believe that the narrowed duty differential will result in lower gold prices in India, making it less attractive for Indians to purchase gold in Dubai.The emirate had attracted gold-enthusiast Indians following a steep rise in customs duty in India in July 2022. In the fiscal 2024-25 budget, the duty on gold imports was more than halved.The duty cut is also expected to boost gold jewellery production in India, particularly the popular 'Kolkatti' jewellery from Kolkata, which is favored by Indian expats in Dubai and tourists from various countries. This move will encourage gold artisans to create new designs in both heavyweight and lightweight jewellery, attracting consumers to purchase gold from India.According to an ET report, Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group , estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India as Indian tourists who previously bought jewellery in Dubai will now prefer to shop in India. However, Indian expats living in Dubai and other customers may continue to buy from the UAE.Also Read | Gold losing sheen?

He points out that the labour cost is significantly lower in India, and with the introduction of mandatory hallmarking and HUID numbers, the purity of gold in India is no longer a concern.Furthermore, NRIs in Dubai do not receive VAT refunds, and Indians travelling abroad only receive about 60% of the VAT back on their gold purchases. Gold trade analyst Bhargav Baidya suggests that the 1% duty differential between gold jewellery in India and Dubai will be offset by Indian jewellers offering discounts to retain and attract customers.Saurabh Gadgil, chairman of PNG Jewellers, notes that Indian import duty is now on par with the US, allowing Indian jewellers to offer competitive prices compared to other countries worldwide. The reduced customs duty is expected to make gold purchases in India more attractive and convenient for Indian consumers, potentially leading to a significant shift in their gold shopping preferences.",The reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai.

Gold losing sheen? The government has reduced its target for issuing gold bonds in the financial year 2024-25 by 38% compared to the previous interim budget goal, according to a senior official. The revised target stands at Rs 18,500 crore, down from Rs 29,638 crore estimated in the interim budget and Rs 26,852 crore (revised estimate) in 2023-24.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told ET ""The decision followed a reassessment of various factors, including investor demand, other investment products and uncertainties around the global economy, as the situation has changed since the interim budget in February.""After accounting for redemptions, the net issuances of sovereign gold bonds are now estimated at Rs 15,000 crore for this fiscal year, a significant decrease from the Rs 26,138 crore projected in the interim budget and Rs 25,352 crore in the revised estimate for 2023-24.Harish Galipelli, director at ILA Commodities India, attributed this shift to retail investors increasingly opting for equities in anticipation of better returns. He also noted that people are uncertain about the potential for further increases in gold prices in the short-to-medium term following a recent rally. Additionally, Galipelli pointed out that savings in rural areas have been impacted by retail inflation and other factors.The gold bond and gold monetisation schemes were introduced by the government in late 2015 to discourage the physical purchase of precious metals and reduce imports, thereby mitigating the negative impact on the current account deficit.The gross collection through these two schemes is now projected to be Rs 20,030 crore in 2024-25, compared to Rs 31,168 crore in the interim budget and Rs 28,240 crore (revised estimate) in the previous fiscal year. Similarly, the net collection is estimated at Rs 16,433 crore, down from Rs 27,571 crore in the interim budget and Rs 26,653 crore in the previous year.

Both schemes were designed to curb gold imports, which, along with crude oil, have been significant contributors to India's current account deficit.

But Farida Akhtar, fish and animal resource ministry adviser in the interim govt, has rejected the demand, citing burgeoning domestic demand. According to reports from Dhaka, Akhtar has asked the commerce ministry to ensure there is no hilsa export this year.Association secretary Syed Anwar Maqsood conceded that signs of getting 'Padmar ilish' are bleak. To add to Bengali gourmands' woes, a 22-day hilsa fishing ban kicks in next month to allow the fish to lay eggs.""Earlier, we had been importing around 5,000 tonnes of hilsa a year from Bangladesh through the Petrapole land customs station,"" Maqsood said. ""The trade was banned by the Bangladesh govt in 2012. From Sept 2019, govt had allowed hilsa trade only during Durga Puja as a goodwill gesture,"" he added.Last September, over 1,300 tonnes of hilsa was exported to India, the same as the year before, under the 'hilsa diplomacy'. In 2021, 1,200 tonnes of hilsa was imported.Maqsood pointed out that in all three years, the amount imported was lower than what had been sanctioned by the Bangladesh govt.In the absence of trade through official channels, hilsa consignments are being smuggled across the border with Tripura and being ferried to Kolkata.

Utilising German Transrapid technology, this magnetic levitation train connects Shanghai Pudong International Airport with Longyang Road station in Pudong district.The 30 km journey takes just 8 minutes and 10 seconds, with the train reaching speeds up to 300 kmph. It previously held the record for the fastest commercial train service with a top speed of 431 kmph.Developed by China Railway Corporation, the CR Harmony and CR Fuxing high-speed trains are notable for their performance. The Harmony train operates at speeds of up to 350 kmph and has achieved testing speeds of 486.1 kmph. The Fuxing also operates at 350 kmph, with test speeds reaching up to 420 kmph.The Siemens Velaro E/AVs 103 set a world speed record of 403.7 kmph during a 2006 test run on the Madrid-Barcelona line. It operates at a normal speed of 350 kmph and is capable of handling snow and ice, though it must slow down to around 160 kmph in severe snowy conditions.The TGV POS, operated by SNCF, was designed for France’s high-speed rail lines, especially the LGV Est, connecting Paris to the German border. This train reaches a top speed of 320 kmph and can accelerate from 0 to 320 kmph in just 5 minutes and 20 seconds.The CRH380A Hexie, developed by CSR Corporation Limited, operates at a cruising speed of 350 kmph and a maximum speed of 380 kmph in commercial service. In testing, it reached speeds of 416.6 kmph with the original eight-car set and 486.1 kmph with the 16-car version.The HEMU-430X is South Korea’s high-speed train capable of reaching 430 kmph. It is the fourth train globally to achieve speeds above 420 kmph, following similar achievements in France, Japan, and China.Frecciarossa, operated by Trenitalia, is a high-speed train service in Italy. It operates at a maximum speed of 300 kmph, covering major cities including Turin, Milan, Rome, Naples, and Venice.The Shinkansen H5 and E5 series, built by Hitachi Rail and Kawasaki Heavy Industries, serve the Tohoku and Hokkaido Shinkansen lines. Both series can reach a maximum speed of 320 kmph and feature an electric active suspension system.Germany’s InterCity Express (ICE) connects major cities across Germany and parts of Central and Western Europe. ICE trains travel at speeds over 300 kmph on high-speed lines and up to 230 kmph on upgraded conventional tracks.","The quest for faster and more efficient rail travel continues to shape the global transportation landscape.

President Joe Biden has delayed implementing a proposedquadruplingof tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles to 100%, and a doubling of duties on semiconductors and solar cells to 50%. He had also proposed new 25% tariffs on lithium-ion batteries, steel and other goods.""Trump's import tariffs are 'history repeating' and will cause a spike in ocean container shipping markets - with consumers picking up the cost,"" said Peter Sand, chief analyst at shipping pricing platform Xeneta.The National Retail Federation, which represents Walmart and other companies that account for almost half of container shipping volume, is among the industry groups opposed to Trump's proposed tariffs.""Tariffs are a tax on imports, operating like a sales tax wearing a mediocre disguise,"" NRF said earlier this week, noting that they drive up cost of goods for consumers and hurt workers and businesses.""We're the poster child of how tariffs did not keep domestic production in place,"" said Matt Priest, CEO of the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America, pointing out that 99% of shoes are now imported.""We will be out there engaging with policy members and discussing how tariffs are paid by American consumers.""Ocean container shipping market rates spiked more than 70% after the Trump Administration announced new tariffs in 2018. The off-contract spot rate to ship a 40-foot (12.19-meter) container on the busy trade route from China to the US West Coast jumped 75% to $2,604 between Jan. 1 and Nov. 1 that year, Xeneta said.The tariffs also disrupted supply chains as shippers fought for extra cargo space on vessels, trucks and trains, while the landed goods swamped ports and warehouses, leading to higher prices for everything from furniture and footwear to steel.Ocean freight rates are already elevated due to ongoing Iran-backed Houthi attacks on ships near the Suez Canal trade shortcut. That pressure, combined with a recent surge in holiday goods and industrial material imports recently sent the cost to ferry a 40-foot container from Shanghai to New York to $10,000.","US presidential contender Donald Trump has floated plans for blanket tariffs of 10% to 20% on virtually all imports.

'JPMorgan and Bank of America to curb young banker work hours',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/jpmorgan-and-bank-of-america-to-curb-young-banker-work-hours/articleshow/113279152.cms,"Two of Wall Street’s largest investment banks are rolling out measures that may ease junior bankers’ workloads amid complaints across the industry that weekly hours are increasingly creeping past 100.JPMorgan Chase & Co will limit junior banker hours to 80 per week in most cases, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Exceptions may include extra work to complete live deals, the person said.Bank of America Corp, meanwhile, is launching a new internal platform this month that will more closely monitor individual workloads, according to a person with knowledge of the plan.The firm began testing the so-called banker diary earlier this year.Demands on Wall Street’s rank and file have swelled in recent months as executives race to capture an upswing in corporate deals — testing promises made by their firms just a few years ago to give junior staff more breaks. The death in May of Bank of America associate Leo Lukenas from a heart attack stirred a debate across the industry over whether workloads are too often unhealthy.Bank of America has said its executives take junior bankers’ health seriously and that the firm frequently reviews policies to ensure they’re protected.Still, some of its junior bankers described to Bloomberg in June how they were shaving down their reported worktime to avoid breaching 100-hour weekly limits. They worried that crossing that line would trigger questions from human resources and draw the ire of managers.This month, the Charlotte, North Carolina-based firm is rolling out a new system for monitoring trainees’ work, with hours reported on a daily basis, rather than weekly, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Part of the idea is to spot who’s busiest and who else has capacity, spreading assignments.“We successfully piloted this improved technology platform earlier this year to help our team more efficiently serve our investment banking clients,” a Bank of America spokesperson said in an emailed statement.The weekly cap on hours at JPMorgan is a first for the bank and is in line with New York state curbs on hours worked by medical residents, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier, along with the news of Bank of America’s new platform.","JPMorgan Chase & Co will limit junior banker hours to 80 per week in most cases, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.

It will also operate e-buses for a period of up to 12 years from the date of deployment.Currently, most of the buses operated by Public Transport Authorities (PTAs) run on diesel or CNG, causing adverse environmental impacts and therefore it will also lead to significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and also reduce the consumption of fossil fuels.E-buses are environmentally friendly and have lower operational costs. However, it was anticipated that Public Transport Authorities (PTAs) would face difficulties in procuring and operating them due to their high initial cost and lower revenue generation from operations.This initiative seeks to encourage private-sector participation and facilitate the adoption of e-buses.This scheme resolves the issue by ensuring timely payments through a dedicated fund. In the event of payment defaults by public transport authorities, CESL , the implementing agency, will cover the necessary payments from the scheme's funds, which will later be recovered from the PTAs, State, or UTs.","PM-eBus Sewa-Payment Security Mechanism (PSM) scheme with an allocated budget of Rs 3,435.33 crore.

US inflation eases to 3-year low as the Federal Reserve prepares to reduce interest rates,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-inflation-reaches-a-3-year-low-as-federal-reserve-prepares-to-reduce-interest-rates/articleshow/113266048.cms,"The US inflation eased further in August, reaching a three-year low and clearing the way for the Federal Reserve to reduce interest rates in the coming week. The consumer price index (CPI) slowed to 2.5 percent in August from a year ago, marking the fifth consecutive annual decline, down from 2.9 percent in July and the lowest annual figure since February 2021, according to the Labor Department .However, Core prices, which exclude the volatile food and energy sectors, rose by 3.2% in August compared to the same month last year, unchanged from July. Month-over-month, core prices increased by 0.3% in August, a slight uptick from the 0.2% rise in July. Economists pay close attention to core prices as they typically provide a more accurate indication of future inflation trends.Meanwhile, the consistent decline in inflation has brought some relief to American consumers, who were hit hard by the price surges that began three years ago, particularly for essential items such as food, gas, and rent. Inflation reached its peak in mid-2022 at 9.1%, the highest level in four decades.Additionally, the Fed 's preferred inflation gauge, the personal consumption expenditures price index ( PCE ), has also been moving closer to the bank's long-term two-percent target in recent months, accompanied by a cooling labor market.Fed policymakers, given these circumstances, have shifted their focus from inflation to unemployment, signaling that rate cuts are imminent. """"The time has come for policy to adjust. The direction of travel is clear, and the timing and pace of rate cuts will depend on incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks,"" Fed chair Jerome Powell said last month.A significant factor contributing to the further easing of inflation in August was the approximately 10-cent per gallon drop in gas prices last month, according to the Energy Inflation Administration, bringing the national average to around $3.29.Another factor that could contribute to a deceleration in inflation is the cooling cost of new apartment leases, as a wave of newly constructed apartments has been completed. Redfin, a real estate brokerage, reported that the median rent for a new lease increased by just 0.9% in August compared to the previous year, reaching $1,645 per month. However, the government's measure encompasses all rents, including those for long-term tenants. It takes time for the slowdown in new rents to be reflected in the government's data. According to the government's consumer price index, rental costs rose 5.1% year-over-year in July.The growth of Americans' paychecks has also moderated to an average of about 3.5% annually, which is still a solid pace but reduces inflationary pressures. Two years ago, wage growth exceeded 5%, a level that can compel businesses to significantly raise prices to cover their higher labor costs.The Fed's anticipated rate cut next week will place the central bank at the center of the political debate, less than two months before the November presidential election, where the economy remains a crucial issue for voters. As the Fed's rate decision approaches, investors will closely monitor the announcement on September 18.According to data from CME Group, futures traders are confident that the Fed will cut rates next week, but the magnitude of the cut remains uncertain. They assign an approximately 85 percent probability to a quarter percentage-point cut and a 15 percent chance of a more aggressive half-point reduction.Although policymakers have emphasized that the timing of rate cuts will be based on economic data rather than political factors, a September cut could potentially irk the Republican candidate and former US president Donald Trump , who has previously suggested, without evidence, that Jerome Powell, whom he initially nominated to lead the Fed, was showing political favoritism towards the Democratic party.","Consumer price index (CPI) slowed to 2.5% in August from a year ago, marking the fifth consecutive annual decline.

Why traders are dialing back bets on Donald Trump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/why-traders-are-dialing-back-bets-on-donald-trump/articleshow/113265790.cms,"Traders are further unwinding bets linked to Donald Trump winning the White House after he suffered what many pundits called a clear defeat in last night’s crucial debate with rival Kamala Harris Trump Media & Technology Group Corp shares tumbled 14% and Bitcoin, an asset that’s been embraced by the former president, retreated slightly. A Bloomberg gauge of the dollar fell as much as 0.3% before recovering.A strong dollar has become somewhat associated with Trump given his plan to penalize countries moving away from the currency.Meanwhile, green energy shares gained on speculation that Democrats would bring more funding for the transition to renewables, with the Invesco Solar ETF adding about 3%.While the moves in a handful of assets deemed likely to benefit from a Trump win offer a signal that positioning is tilting in favor of Harris, strategists warned against reading too much into the price action. The race remains very close and some of the moves could be explained by shifts in the outlook for the US economy.“Markets seem to have awarded Harris a victory,” wrote Francesco Pesole , a currency strategist at ING Bank. “In FX, a Trump win is associated with a stronger dollar, which is trading on the soft side across the board.”The odds of the Democratic party candidate winning the election increased on the betting website PredictIt to 56%, compared with 53% before the debate. Wall Street has been adjusting its election bets for the past few weeks, tracking Vice President Harris’ rise in the polls.One factor complicating any market interpretation of the debate was the report on US consumer prices also landing on Wednesday. With the Federal Reserve widely expected to cut interest rates next week, some strategists said the impact of monetary policy should outweigh any speculation on US politics.What Bloomberg’s strategists say:“The main markets takeaway from all the political analysis is that it would be financial folly to have conviction on who will win this election that’s still eight weeks away. Never mind worrying how you actually profit from knowing that answer, given the lack of clarity over what policy each candidate would be able to implement quickly, and the debate over how assets would subsequently react.”— Mark Cudmore , MLIV executive editor in SingaporeShares of Trump Media, which operates Truth Social and counts the presidential candidate as its top shareholder, have at times traded as a proxy for Trump’s election odds, rising sharply after an assassination attempt in July, when there was a sharp rise in betting-market odds of him winning a second term. Other times, it’s traded like a volatile meme stock, swinging wildly on little to no news or fundamental changes to its underlying business.The company is also facing the expiration of a lockup period, which could take place as soon as Sept. 19 and enable insiders — including Trump himself — to start selling shares.At Citigroup Inc, strategists pointed to dollar weakness as an indication that Harris bested Trump in the debate, but added that the currency will stay strong heading into November given that tariffs remain a central plank of Trump’s economic platform.“We still expect the election will remain close enough in the coming weeks that markets will maintain some premium for Trump policies,” wrote strategists including Daniel Tobon at Citigroup. “It remains to be seen if voters agree with betting and financial markets.”Jefferies International’s Mohit Kumar echoed the caution around trades tied to a specific candidate and said the debate didn’t produce a clear winner. Even so, he said Harris did better than expected and her policies would likely focus less on tax cuts and fiscal expansion than Trump.In the view of Saxo Bank, it’s still a challenge to price in a Harris trade, especially because the Democrats will likely face a split Congress.“Harris’ rising prominence could have notable effects across various sectors,” wrote Charu Chanana, global market strategist at Saxo. “Many of the other ‘Trump Trades’ such as a weaker Chinese yuan or traction in defense stocks could take a backseat.”",Traders are unwinding bets linked to Donald Trump winning the White House.
