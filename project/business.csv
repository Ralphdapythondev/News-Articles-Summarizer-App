The National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission ( NCDRC ) has ordered Indian Railways to compensate a passenger whose belongings were stolen on the Amarkantak Express in May 2017.The passenger, Dilip Kumar Chaturvedi, had taken ""reasonable precautions"" to secure his luggage, but the Travelling Ticket Examiner (TTE) failed to prevent ""outsiders"" from entering the reserved coach. According to a TOI report , the NCDRC dismissed Indian Railways' argument that under Section 100 of the Railway Act, they are not responsible for loss, destruction, or deterioration of luggage unless it has been booked and a receipt has been given.The bench imposed a cost of Rs 20,000 on Indian Railways for causing mental agony to the passenger and said, ""...it is concluded that Railways is liable for the theft, and there was deficiency in service provided to the petitioner (passenger) owing to negligence of railway officials concerned.""Also Read | India’s first high-speed 280 kmph trains soon!

He filed an FIR with the railway police , saying that his luggage, containing cash and articles worth around Rs 9.3 lakh, had been stolen around 2.30 AM.Chaturvedi initially filed a case in the Durg district consumer commission, which directed the South East Central Railway GM, Durg station master, and Bilaspur GRP thana in-charge to pay the claimed amount.

'Where will the dogs go...': Tata Sons Chairman N Chandrasekaran recalls his memorable moments with Ratan Tata in heartfelt post,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/where-will-the-dogs-go-tata-sons-chairman-n-chandrasekaran-recalls-his-memorable-moments-with-ratan-tata-in-heartfelt-post/articleshow/114206597.cms,"N Chandrasekaran, Chairman of Tata Sons has shared heartfelt reflections on the life and legacy of Ratan Tata. (Image source: N Chandrasekaran LinkedIn)

Below is the full text of N Chandrasekaran’s LinkedIn post:

Anybody who met Mr. Tata came away with a story about his humanity, warmth, and dreams for India. There really was no one like him.

Our relationship grew over the years, first focusing on business and eventually evolving into a more personal connection. We discussed interests ranging from cars to hotels, but when our conversations turned to other matters—those of daily life—he would show how much he noticed and felt. He was someone to be discovered, over time and through experience.

I remember several such instances.

Just after I became Chairman, I was introduced to a situation within Tata Motors which involved a dispute between the company and the employees’ union over wages for two years. In March ‘17, Mr. Tata and I met the union leaders together. During the meeting, Mr. Tata relayed three messages: he regretted the delay in finding a resolution. He explained that the company was passing through hardship. And both of us committed that this dispute would be concluded within a fortnight.

Mr. Tata’s direction squarely focused on making sure employees were well taken care of—not just to resolve the dispute, but to ensure their and their families’ well-being. Across other Group companies, his perspective on employees was uniform. It is something that has shaped a number of our leaders across the Group.

Around that same time, I expressed a desire to renovate our headquarters, Bombay House. Bombay House had not been touched since 1924, and more important (as many people told me) Mr. Tata would not like it. “Bombay House is a temple,” I was told, emphasising its sanctity.

When I finally mentioned to Mr. Tata about Bombay House, he said, “May I ask you something? When you say ‘renovate’, do you mean ‘vacate’?”

I explained that we planned to move everyone to a nearby office.

He gently clarified: “Where will the dogs go?”

The dogs were an integral part of Bombay House, often seen at the reception.

“We will build a kennel.”

“Really?” he said, considering it.

When the renovation of Bombay House was complete, Mr. Tata wanted to see the kennel first.

He was very happy to see how thoughtful the kennel’s design was, and how well the dogs would be cared for.

Seeing his happiness with the kennel and his priorities was a reminder that while big projects are important, it’s the details that reveal how we think, what we prioritise, and how we are perceived. His joy was confirmation that we had done the right thing.

If Mr. Tata ever visited a place, he could recall everything—from the placement of smallest piece of furniture, the lighting, colours, and so on. His memory was photographic. He remembered the covers and content of books and magazines and referred to them even years later. He was always observing and processing, from large ideas to minute detail.

There is so much else to say about who he was, but for now, as I process his absence, this will have to do: His eye received everything clearly, as his mind perceived everything clearly.","N Chandrasekaran, Chairman of Tata Sons has shared heartfelt reflections on the life and legacy of Ratan Tata.

DA: Dearness allowance hiked!

Dearness Allowance/Dearness Relief is paid to central government employees/pensioners to adjust the cost of living and to protect their basic pay/pension from erosion in the real value.

DA/DR for employees/pensioners increased by 3% from 1.07.2024

The financial implication for the hike will be Rs 9,448 crore.

DA hike and DR for central government employees : Diwali 2024 came early for central government employees/pensioners with PM Narendra Modi-led Union Cabinet approving the much awaited dearness allowance and dearness relief hike. The dearness allowance/dearness relief has been hiked by 3%.Generally, the central government assesses and adjusts the DA twice yearly, in January and July, with official announcements made subsequently.While serving employees receive DA, pensioners are entitled to Dearness Relief.The last DA adjustment, a 4% hike, was announced in March, with effect from January 2024. After that central government employees were eligible for DA of 50% of their basic salary, while pensioners receive a DR of 50% of their basic pension.The increase in DA and DR would provide financial relief to approximately 1.15 crore central government employees and pensioners, offering a substantial monetary support amidst the rising cost of living.DA serves as a component of the salary intended to mitigate the effects of inflation. A hike in DA periodically adjusts the effective salary of government employees to maintain their purchasing power.Dearness Allowance or DA for central government employees is determined using the most recent Consumer Price Index for Industrial Workers (CPI-IW) data. This index is released on a monthly basis by the Labour Bureau, which operates under the Ministry of Labour. To calculate the DA percentage under the 7th Pay Commission, the following formula is used:7th CPC DA% = [{12 month average of AICPI-IW (Base Year 2001=100) for the last 12 months – 261.42}/261.42x100]It is worth noting that when a DA or DR increase is announced, it is typically applied retroactively from January 1 and July 1 of the current year. Traditionally, the central government declares the July DA increase prior to the onset of the festive season.","DA/DR for employees/pensioners increased by 3% from 1.07.2024.

While countries may prefer to design their own systems based on domestic considerations, Das suggested that this challenge could be overcome by developing a plug-and-play system that allows replicability of India's experience while maintaining the sovereignty of respective countries.","Real Time Gross Settlement System or RTGS could possibly be expanded to include the settlement of transactions in major trade currencies such as the US dollar, euro, and pound sterling.

RIL bonus share: Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries sets record date for 1:1 bonus share,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/ril-bonus-share-mukesh-ambani-led-reliance-industries-sets-record-date-for-11-bonus-share-details-here/articleshow/114290660.cms,"RIL bonus shares: The issuance of bonus shares in a 1:1 ratio was initially announced by Mukesh Ambani during the 28th AGM.

RIL bonus share issue: What does it mean for investors?

RIL bonus share record date : Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries (RIL), a diversified conglomerate spanning from oil to retail, has announced that the record date for determining shareholders eligible for the 1:1 bonus share issue will be Monday, October 28, 2024.The issuance of bonus shares in a 1:1 ratio was initially announced by Mukesh Ambani , the company's chairman, during the 28th annual general meeting (AGM).""We are in the business of creating wealth for India and enhancing the quality of life of every Indian, every single day,"" Ambani had said, emphasizing that when Reliance grows, shareholders are rewarded handsomely.The company has received shareholder approval for both the bonus share issue and the increase in its authorised share capital, as per a filing with the stock exchanges.According to an ET report, the resolution for the bonus share issue received overwhelming support, with 99.92% of the votes cast in favor and only 0.07% against it.Similarly, the resolution for increasing the authorised share capital and amending the Capital Clause of the Memorandum of Association garnered 98.96% votes in favor, while 1.04% were against it.Following the changes, RIL's authorised share capital now stands at Rs 50,000 crore, comprising 4,900 crore equity shares of Rs 10 each and 100 crore preference shares of Rs 10 each.According to a regulatory filing by RIL, ""The bonus shares will be issued out of securities premium account received in cash and/or general reserve and/or retained earnings available as of March 31, 2024."" The corporate action will result in the company's authorised share capital increasing from Rs 15,000 crore to Rs 50,000 crore, as previously reported by ET.RIL has announced a 1:1 bonus issue, which means that for every existing share held by its 35 lakh shareholders, they will receive one additional share at no cost. As a result, if an investor currently owns 1,000 RIL shares, their holding will increase to 2,000 shares after the bonus issue.It is important to note that while the number of shares held by each shareholder will double, the total value of their investment will remain unchanged. This is because the share price will be adjusted proportionately to reflect the increased number of outstanding shares.One of the primary benefits of bonus issues is the improvement in stock liquidity. With a larger number of shares available in the market, a wider range of investors can access and trade the stock more easily.Throughout its history, RIL has issued bonus shares on five occasions. The first bonus issue was in 1980 at a ratio of 3:5, followed by a 6:10 bonus issue in 1983. The most recent three bonus issues, in 1997, 2009, and 2017, have all been in the ratio of 1:1.","RIL has announced a 1:1 bonus issue, which means that for every existing share held by its 35 lakh shareholders, they will receive one additional share at no cost.

DA Hike Calculator: How much will the take home salary increase?

To understand the impact of this 3% DA hike, let's consider an example:

Assuming a central government employee has a basic pay of Rs 46,200, their previous dearness allowance at 50% was Rs 23,100. With the DA now at 53%, their dearness allowance will increase to Rs 24,486.

This means they will receive an additional Rs 1,386 (Rs 24,486 - Rs 23,100) in DA from October. As the DA hike is effective from July 1, 2024, they will also receive arrears for the last three months.

DR Hike Calculator: How much will the pension increase?

If a central government pensioner receives a basic pension of Rs 50,400 per month, at the previous 50% DR, they were getting Rs 25,200.

With the DR now at 53%, they will receive Rs 26,712 monthly as dearness relief. This means their pension will increase by Rs 1,512 per month.

DA hike calculator : PM Narendra Modi-led Union Cabinet has approved a 3% increase in the dearness allowance (DA) for central government employees on October 16, 2024. Additionally, the dearness relief (DR) for central government pensioners has also been raised by 3%. As a result of this latest hike, the DA and DR now stand at 53% for both central government employees and pensioners respectively.This decision is set to benefit over 1 crore individuals.The dearness allowance, a component of the salary for government employees and pensioners, has been increased to 53%. This rise in DA will lead to an increase in the take-home salary of central government employees starting from October 2024.The effective date for the increased DA and DR is July 1, 2024. The central government typically revises these allowances twice a year, in January and July, with official announcements being made at a later date. Consequently, the DA/DR hike is implemented retrospectively from the cut-off date of July 1, 2024.Also Read | Dearness allowance hiked!

The urban jobless rate dropped to 5.1% from 5.3% in August

China’s economic expansion slowed in the third quarter, underscoring the need for additional stimulus to help the world’s second-largest economy reach its annual growth target.Gross domestic product increased 4.6% in the July-to-September period from a year prior, data released by the National Bureau of Statistics showed Friday, the slowest pace since March 2023 and down from a growth of 4.7% in the second quarter.The figure was higher than the median estimate of 4.5% in a Bloomberg survey of economists, bringing growth for the first nine months to 4.8%.China unleashed a swath of stimulus measures in late September including interest rate cuts and support for the property and equity markets to draw a line under a slowing economy. Investors now expect Chinese lawmakers to approve additional budget or debt sales to fund public spending in an upcoming meeting after authorities promised fiscal support.The slate of measures prompted a historic stock rally and led banks including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to upgrade their forecasts for China’s growth. But skepticism has grown over whether authorities are willing to deploy greater fiscal firepower to turn around the economy and markets.The stock market has been on a roller-coaster ride, with the benchmark CSI 300 Index soaring to its highest level since July 2022 in early October, before falling about 10% since then.The other key indicators show a broad improvement in different parts of the economy in September:Data released before Friday painted a dismal picture for growth in September. Exports slowed sharply, curbing a trade rebound that has been a bright spot for the economy. Deflationary pressures continued to build, with consumer prices still weak and factory gate prices falling for 24 straight months.President Xi Jinping called on government officials to “make every effort” in the fourth quarter to help the economy meet its annual growth target of around 5%, state media reported on Wednesday. That’s the second time in about a month Xi has urged officials to pursue economic growth.Economists have urged Beijing to boost consumer spending to avoid a spiral of falling prices, which could risk a self-reinforcing cycle of declining spending, shrinking business revenues and job losses. But authorities have shown little urgency to ramp up consumption with any direct stimulus or large-scale handouts, which Xi has long resisted due to concerns over what he calls “welfarism.”A real estate slump in its fourth year has hurt a pillar of growth and weighed on sentiment. Beijing is seeking to stop the property decline with a basket of policies including a Thursday pledge to nearly double the loan quota for unfinished residential projects. The measures fell short of market expectations, causing property shares to retreat as investors looked for more forceful response to pull the sector out of the doldrums.","Gross domestic product increased 4.6% in the July-to-September period from a year prior.

Railway Budget 2024 : The government has wavered little in its efforts to spur a modernisation of railways in the country, pivoting on technology, to support the country’s economic ambitions. In line with expectations, Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore, marking yet another year of successive increase in outlay.That takes forward the past policies and the government’s vision, which have paved the way for modernisation of the transport behemoth.In earlier decades, the government had focused on laying tracks on new routes, electrification and incremental rolling stock capacity addition. That was the need of the hour back then and has helped set up the base for a larger transformation.For instance, the massive Dedicated Freight Corridor ( DFC ) as well as locomotive factories at Marhaura and Madhepura in Bihar were conceptualised over a decade ago and we are seeing their completion now.More recently, the focus has shifted to modernisation—of rolling stock and safety systems, among other aspects.This year, emphasis has also been laid on the railways’ crucial role in industrial development. Commodity-specific corridors have been planned in eastern India and impetus given to port connectivity. Vande Bharat and technology-led upgrades in rolling stock remain in focus. Safety has been prioritised through budgetary allocations for the anti-collision systemKavach . That said, there are other cogs in the wheel that demand attention from a long-term perspective.First, the target for the Operating Ratio, the crucial efficiency gauge, has been set at 98.22% for 2024-25, compared with 98.65% in 2023-24. This reflects an imminent need for operational transformation. An effective overhaul of the world’s fourth-largest rail network will take many years and thus we need to start focusing on improving efficiency and reducing costs now.DFC is almost entirely operational and will be complete over the next few months. To ensure the project achieves its twin goals of reducing logistics costs and enhancing freight efficiency, railways need to attract more cargo on the corridor. This will help increase the rail coefficient and make the railways’ approach more market-oriented, which will in turn aid future corridors.A revamp of railway stations is on track, with sufficient funds dedicated to this end. But even though new coaches and wagons are increasingly being added to meet footfalls, the stations and passenger trains themselves remain synonymous with chaos.Just as safety, comfort and convenience have been prioritised, there is a need for solutions to address the capacity and demand challenges. As a first step, the government could target development of new stations and setting up of new coach production units.As a leading freight mover, Indian Railways carried a record 1,588 MT cargo in fiscal 2024, up from 1,095 MT in fiscal 2015. It accounts for 26% of the cargo moved in the country—by no means an easy feat. The railways aims to take this volume to 3,000 MT by 2030, which would require a 11% CAGR against the around 4.2% witnessed over the last 10 years. As per a report by TERI and Shakti Foundation, from carrying about 62% of freight traffic in 1990-91, Indian Railways’ share has declined to ~27% in 2014-15. This has been due to the expanding road network, cost competitiveness over railways, and door-to-door service. Thus, commencing the cycle of increasing the rail share again is commendable.DFCs, a high-capacity track network, high-power locomotives and improvement in wagon designs have set the ball rolling for larger capacity, faster freight trains that deliver better efficiency.Yet, achieving exponential growth is a tall ask given the current dynamics. Possibly, similar challenges might apply to other goals the railways might have for 2047.To be fair, despite its scale and complexity, Indian Railways has been able to achieve diverse developments at commendable speed.But the track ahead is long and it is time to start discussing the reinvention of the institutional set-up.Indian Railways sees substantial private sector involvement in the form of vendors and contractors. Policymakers could start mulling extreme options such as parallel privately-owned and operated railway infrastructure, coupled with centralised planning and an evolved role for the railways. This will need a robust policy framework from the Government of India.The time is perhaps also ripe to bring user charge and asset monetisation-driven segments for passengers as well as cargo to the discussion table. Globally, the separation of infrastructure and operations in railways has delivered mixed results, for example in the United Kingdom. The model should be analysed and revisited to understand its potential relevance in the Indian context.The key would be to retrace our steps and align our long-term goals to identify not just incremental changes but also ways to explore bold and path-breaking alternatives that put Indian Railways on a smooth track and bring it up to speed.","Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore.

Budget 2024 capital gains tax changes: The Narendra Modi government is considering suggestions for tweaks in the new long term capital gains tax regime that was announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman in Union Budget 2024.The July 23 budget reduced the LTCG tax on property from 20% to 12.5%. The indexation benefit, which allowed taxpayers to adjust the acquisition cost for inflation before calculating capital gains and thus reduce their tax liability, is proposed to be eliminated for properties purchased on or after April 1, 2001.The government publishes the Cost Inflation Index (CII) annually for this calculation.India Inc is appealing to the government for a gradual shift to the long-term capital gains tax regime proposed in the FY25 budget, which aims to eliminate indexation benefits for property, gold, and other unlisted assets.According to an ET report by Deepshikha Sikarwar, the industry is suggesting alternatives such as a higher tax rate with indexation or a lower rate of 12.5% without indexation, as well as some form of grandfathering for ancestral properties.The finance ministry is currently reviewing these proposals and will discuss them with the Prime Minister's Office. The final decision will be made closer to the date when the Finance Bill reply is to be presented in Parliament, the reports said.Industry groups are expected to submit formal proposals to the finance ministry in the near future.

Budget 2024 for manufacturing sector : The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth. While the middle class has been offered tax relief, the government's primary focus remains on judicious spending to maximize economic impact. The budget's core themes are employment, skilling, MSME development, and support for the middle class.Largely focus has remained intact on spending money judiciously to ensure that each penny spent creates a ripple effect in the entire economic landscape.Although at first glance, manufacturing might appear to have taken a backseat, a deeper analysis reveals a multifaceted approach to bolstering the sector. Initiatives like employment-linked benefits and internship programs, while primarily aimed at job creation and skill development, indirectly benefit manufacturing companies by expanding the talent pool.Extensive focus on the MSME manufacturing units by way of extending term loan facility for purchase of machinery and equipment without collateral or third-party guarantee, would help companies in augmenting their capital base/ capacity and strengthen the very foundation of the manufacturing ecosystem in the country. Development of a new credit-assessment model by Public Sector Banks to assess MSME credit shall provide much needed regulatory relief to the units.With respect to the large manufacturing entities, while there is no direct fiscal/ tax incentive introduced in this budget, some support has been provided with an extensive focus on development of ‘industrial parks’ in nearly 100 cities under the ‘plug and play’ model. Reforms proposed with respect to land administration, planning and management, shall also ease out acquisition related difficulties often faced by entrepreneurs/ business houses in acquiring lands for manufacturing set-ups.Targeted Customs duty interventions like, rationalization of Customs duty provisions in Mobile phone manufacturing setups, extension of Customs duty exemption on import of capital goods for manufacturing of solar cells and panels, full Customs duty exemption on import of 25 critical minerals,, shall provide the required impetus for enhancing domestic manufacturing environment.Governments’ focus on formulating an Economic Policy Framework to set the scope for next-gen reforms in the country, has a target to improve the productivity of factors of production, namely, land, labour, capital, entrepreneurship and technology. This shall pave the way for enabling achievement of a target of 25% manufacturing sector contribution to the nation’s GDP over the course of next 7-10 years.While the overall outlook is positive, the extension of tax benefits under Section 115BAB for manufacturing entities and the absence of new PLI schemes are notable omissions.The country’s manufacturing base is expanding as is reflective from the continuously increasing tax collections and expanding Purchasing Manager’s Index. It would be pertinent to see how the ground realities evolve vis-à-vis the vision envisaged, in the upcoming Financial Year.","While the overall outlook is positive, the extension of tax benefits under Section 115BAB for manufacturing entities and the absence of new PLI schemes are notable omissions.

Budget 2024: Armed with the vision to propel India to become a developed country by 2047, the Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business thereby providing the required stimulus to the manufacturing sector and enabling large scale job creation.On the Indirect tax front, the industry welcomes the much-needed announcement for a comprehensive review of the rate structure under Customs enabling ease in product classification and dispute reduction.The proposal of lowering of Customs duty on a plethora of raw materials and products including solar cells, critical minerals and bullion are encouraging measures. The rationale behind such reduction clearly indicates support towards domestic manufacturing, deepening value addition and supporting targets in reducing carbon footprint.Relevant amendments under the Customs law have been made to provide increased time limits for re-imports and re-exports to enhance competitiveness of the fledgling MRO sector. The government has extended significant duty reduction and exemption benefits to the healthcare and electronics sectors, continuing the impetus of incentives provided under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme.Since their introduction in March 2020, the PLI schemes have indeed supported in revitalizing the manufacturing sector and strengthening the necessary supply chains. The success achieved in the mobile manufacturing sector has now enabled the Government to reduce customs duties on mobile phones and components, signalling a mature environment. The Budget proposals aim at reproducing similar outcomes for semiconductor and pharmaceutical industry by increasing the budgetary allocation.Buoyed by the increasing revenue collection under GST signalling a shift towards a mature tax regime, this Budget has harmonized the timeframes for the issuance of demand notices and adjudication orders for cases involving fraud, suppression or otherwise. Significant amendments to the GST legislations have been introduced reflecting the recommendations proposed by the GST Council such as regularizing non-levy of GST due to general practice which may turn out to be a breather for certain impacted industries reeling under huge tax demands.The Insurance sector has been provided much relief through the GST council recommendations which have been cemented in the present budget thereby ending long standing disputes on their business practices.The Government's efforts to push forward with its reform agenda are evident as plans to incentivize states for their business reform actions plans and digitalization through the Jan Vishwas Bill 2.0 is proposed. Further, setting up of e-commerce export hubs is envisaged to facilitate easier access to international markets for domestic players.The recent implementation of Budget proposals allows the government to maintain momentum in its reform agenda. These policy measures implicitly reaffirm the significance of India Inc as a crucial element in the development of infrastructure. However, there are still some expectations required to be met to march towards a Viksit Bharat 2047.",Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business.

Budget 2024 : Real estate, a significant contributor to employment generation, has received a fair bit of attention in Budget 2024-25. Recent years have seen the sector transform rapidly, driven by factors such as favourable government policies, Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, strong economic growth and changing consumer preferences.Added to that, the budgetary focus on job creation, skilling and employment-linked incentives, infrastructure, urban development, rural connectivity, digitalisation and land-related norms, all dovetail to promote growth of the sector.Launched in June 2015, the PMAY aims to provide affordable housing to all eligible beneficiaries. The budget unveiled PMAY Urban 2.0, under which the housing needs of 1 crore urban poor and middle class will be addressed with an investment of Rs 10 lakh crore.The central government’s additional Rs 2.2 lakh crore injection in the next 5 years to make housing more affordable has the potential to revitalise the affordable housing market.Such an approach can play an important role in realising the government's vision of Housing for All and push growth and development. Hence, the significant investment under PMAY Urban 2.0 is expected to alleviate urban housing deficits, spurring construction and economic growth.Steps to introduce technological reforms within the regulatory framework for land, such as digitalisation or GIS mapping of land records, will improve transparency.Rationalisation of stamp duty across states will also be critical to bring in uniformity and initiate land-related reforms such as urban planning, usage and building bylaws.These are steps in the right direction and will boost growth. Moreover, they will improve the ease of property transactions and strengthen municipal finances through increased property taxes. Rationalization of stamp duty with an emphasis on women homebuyers may boost home-buyer sentiment in major cities, too.The budget has also given ample attention to urban and rural development, with rental housing for industrial workers through the public private partnership model, interest subsidies for rental housing, and transit-oriented developments.The proposal to develop investment-ready plug-and-play industrial parks in 100 cities may attract industrial investment, leading to increased demand for industrial real estate and support the growth of ancillary services and residential developments in these regions.Initiatives for industrial parks and rental housing for industrial workers align with the country’s manufacturing goals and addresses worker accommodation needs.These steps are expected to promote industrial growth and stability in labour-intensive sectors, while also creating new opportunities for real estate developers specialising in rental and affordable housing.The changes in long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax, however, have evoked a mixed reaction. The government lowered the long-term capital gains tax from 20% to 12.5%, which is a welcome step. However, this came with the removal of the indexation benefit.The changes could encourage more liquidity in property transactions and potentially increase the effective tax burden depending on the property’s acquisition date.The launch of Phase IV of the PM Gram Sadak Yojana in 25,000 rural habitations will improve connectivity in rural areas, promoting rural development and making these regions more accessible for investment. The primary objective of PMGSY is to build robust, all-weather roads in rural habitations. This initiative focuses on enhancing connectivity and supporting economic development in rural areas.In essence, the budget is geared towards stimulating growth and investment in the real estate sector , fostering a more transparent and investor-friendly environment, and contributing to overall development. It aims to create a balanced and inclusive growth environment by addressing the needs of various segments, including affordable housing, industrial workers and urban infrastructure.The effectiveness of the initiatives, however, hinges on their implementation and continued support of complementary reforms.","The budget unveiled PMAY Urban 2.0, under which the housing needs of 1 crore urban poor and middle class will be addressed with an investment of Rs 10 lakh crore.

New Budget 2024 rule: Why Income Tax Department is likely to issue a huge number of tax notices this month,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-budget-2024-rule-why-income-tax-department-is-likely-to-issue-a-huge-number-of-tax-notices-this-month/articleshow/112186079.cms,"Taxing Times

Income Tax Notice on the way? The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month, as there are concerns that many taxpayers might escape the tax net due to the impending implementation of the new reassessment law on September 1, 2024.According to the amended regulation announced in Budget 2024 , the tax authorities can only go back a maximum of five years to reassess a taxpayer's records if the escaped income is at least Rs 50 lakh, and three years for an amount less than Rs 50 lakh.Previously, they could reassess cases up to 10 years old.According to an ET report, tax officials are now faced with the challenge of compiling and corroborating data on tax and income mismatches for the financial years 2013-14 to 2017-18 within the next few weeks, as these years will become time-barred for reassessment from September 1, 2024.The I-T department relies on information from various sources, such as banks, property registrars, and search findings from the investigation wing, to build reassessment cases.A tax officers' body has raised concerns about the feasibility of issuing notices under Section 148 (or 148A) in a large number of cases within a single month, given the overburdened nature of the jurisdictional assessing officers and the time-consuming process of obtaining sanction from the chief commissioner, who is the specified authority for such notices.Moreover, the law provides taxpayers with the right to explain their position before reassessment orders are finalized, a process that most believe cannot be completed by the end of August.Also Read | ITR refund status for FY 2023-24: How to check income tax refund status online - here’s a step-by-step guide for incometax.gov.in & NSDL websites The Central Board of Direct Taxes ( CBDT ) has been urged by its officers to postpone the effective date of the proposed amendment. However, this suggestion is unlikely to be well-received by corporations and high net worth individuals.""Capping the reassessment period at five years was a great decision as it would reduce hassles and litigation. But if the department fears there could be a genuine loss of revenue as it may not be possible to wrap up several matters by August 31, the government can think of strict parameters where time-bound cases can be selectively reopened - based on trails of steps taken in identifying escaped income,"" said Mitil Chokshi, partner at CA firm Chokshi & Chokshi.""Taxpayers may expect a rush of reassessment notices in August 2024. These notices are likely to be for the AYs 2018-19 and prior to that. It is pertinent to note that the Bombay High Court in a recent ruling in a case of Hexaware Technologies has taken a view on a proviso introduced in 2021, which can be interpreted to mean that AY 2017-18 (and prior years) got time barred on March 31, 2024. These reassessment notices (for AYs 2017-18 and prior) are likely to rake up new interpretation issues in the already muddled reassessment provisions,"" said Ashish Mehta, partner at law firm Khaitan & Co.The current situation is similar to the conflict between the Income Tax office and taxpayers in 2021. The reassessment law was amended in April 2021, allowing the tax office to reopen 10-year-old tax returns if the total undisclosed income exceeded Rs 50 lakh and reassess 4-year-old matters if the amount was less than Rs 50 lakh.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? However, this change led to over 10,000 writ petitions being filed by companies, arguing that they were not given sufficient time to explain and that the notices were issued without considering the carve-out that cases which couldn't be reopened earlier couldn't be reassessed under the new law.The Supreme Court invoked its extraordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution on May 4, 2022, to uphold all reassessment notices issued after March 31, 2021. However, the court left room for judicial proceedings based on the merits of each case, and several such matters are currently pending before the court.","The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month.

Budget 2024: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday addressed a CII post- Budget 2024 conference, stating that in 10 years, his government has tripled India’s Budget. The last Budget presented by the Manmohan Singh government in 2014 was of Rs 16 lakh crore. Ten years later, the Union Budget 2024 presented by us a few days ago is Rs 48 lakh crore, which is three times, Modi said.Modi also said that the capital expenditure allocation under his governments has grown manifold.""Capital expenditure is called the biggest productive medium of resource investment,"" he said at the ‘Journey Towards Viksit Bharat: A Post Union Budget 2024-25' conference. In 2004, the capex allocation of UPA’s first Budget was Rs 90,000 crore. This increased to only Rs 2 lakh crore in the last UPA budget in 2014, Modi said. At present the capex allocation is over Rs 11 lakh crore, Modi added. Modi pointed out that the capex allocation of railways and highways has become 8 times under his government. PM Modi said that India, which is currently the world’s fifth largest economy, will soon become the third largest.

How NPS will increase tax savings

NPS and EPF: Overlapping services

What is NPS Vatsalaya?

Latest NPS rules, news: In the Union Budget 2024 speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced two new initiatives with regard to National Pension Scheme (NPS) - extension of NPS 14% employer contribution benefits to private setcor and the intended launch of NPS Vatsalya.Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries, bringing it at par with the provisions available for government employees.Sriram Iyer, CEO, HDFC Pension Management told ET that with this move the “ground rules have been harmonised among government and non-government employees, which is a positive step.”Effectively, this means that now, private-sector employees can choose to reduce the taxable portion of employers’ contribution to their NPS corpus, thereby paying less tax and leaving greater funds in their pension deposits.“Employees will benefit from tax savings . More importantly, the 40% increase in contribution will have a significant impact on the terminal value of the retirement corpus,” remarked Iyer. The extended savings will “help in retirement planning, working as an option that is at par with the Provident Fund,” Dinesh Rohira, CEO & Founder, 5nance.com was quoted as saying.Moreover, the endeavour aims to increase NPS penetration by increasing tax incentives for the private sector, providing them a social security-cushion post-retirement.The scheme’s motive to widen the NPS subscriber base may not prove to be flawlessly effective, however. This is explained by Agrees Mrin Agarwal, Founder, Finsafe India: “While it’s good that the limit has been raised, it may not increase adoption as employees need to be educated in a big way. Also, the benefit is only for the salaried opting for the new tax regime,” she says.The mandatory contribution to the EPF, too, threatens to relegate the provisions of NPS under the umbrella of near-superfluity. This sentiment is echoed by Varun Sahay, a software engineer in a Delhi-based IT company: “When 12% of my salary is already deducted for the EPF, why should I put in more in the NPS and cut my take-home pay?”Rohira feels otherwise. “There’s no competition between the NPS and EPF as employees can contribute to both and build a 3-4 times bigger corpus while earning 3-4% higher returns via marketlinked options in the NPS,” he counters.Also Check | New Tax Regime 2023 vs 2024 After Budget: How Much Income Tax Will Salaried Taxpayers Save & How Do New Tax Slabs Compare To Old Regime? Top 10 Points You Must Know To jumpstart retirement savings for children, a new initiative called NPS Vatsalya has been unveiled in the Budget. This scheme allows parents and guardians to contribute to a minor's account, which can be converted into a regular NPS account once the child reaches adulthood.""It provides a very long duration for reaping the compounding benefits and accumulating a huge bounty at a later age. This can be a good way to plan a better future for kids who may not opt for a service segment in the future,"" says Rohira. Sriram Iyer agrees, stating, ""It’s a good move to help the child start his retirement journey. Even if a parent starts when the child is 10 years old, by the time he starts working, it can be a solid foundation for the compounding journey after that.""However, some experts question the utility of a product with such a long lock-in period, especially when parents cannot use the funds for essential goals like their child’s education amidst soaring education costs of 11-12%.""Parents are struggling to save for their own retirement, so it might be a bit of a stretch to expect them to save for their kids’ retirement. The need of the hour is a market-linked product that allows withdrawals only for the child’s education,"" says Mrin Agarwal, Founder of Finsafe India.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? Though the NPS permits partial withdrawals, it allows only 25% of the corpus after three years of joining, and this can be done only three times during the entire tenure. A premature exit before 60 years with 100% withdrawal is only possible if the corpus is less than Rs.2.5 lakh, an amount insufficient for most children's goals.""In its current form, there won’t be any uptake,"" asserts Agarwal. Rohira concurs, ""It’s a vanilla product with a lock-in, which does not make it very attractive and it may not take off. However, the government may optimise it and introduce new features later."" Iyer adds, ""This is just a start and there may be more subscriber-friendly features as we take it to the market. The regulator is proactive and open to feedback.""","Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries.

Gold import duty cut: Why Indians may not find buying gold from Dubai as attractive post Budget 2024,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-import-duty-cut-why-indians-may-not-find-buying-gold-from-dubai-as-attractive-post-budget-2024/articleshow/112097671.cms,"Gold import duty cut: Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group, estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India.

Gold import duty cut in Budget 2024: The recent reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai. Indian jewellers with stores in both India and the UAE believe that the narrowed duty differential will result in lower gold prices in India, making it less attractive for Indians to purchase gold in Dubai.The emirate had attracted gold-enthusiast Indians following a steep rise in customs duty in India in July 2022. In the fiscal 2024-25 budget, the duty on gold imports was more than halved.The duty cut is also expected to boost gold jewellery production in India, particularly the popular 'Kolkatti' jewellery from Kolkata, which is favored by Indian expats in Dubai and tourists from various countries. This move will encourage gold artisans to create new designs in both heavyweight and lightweight jewellery, attracting consumers to purchase gold from India.According to an ET report, Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group , estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India as Indian tourists who previously bought jewellery in Dubai will now prefer to shop in India. However, Indian expats living in Dubai and other customers may continue to buy from the UAE.Also Read | Gold losing sheen?

He points out that the labour cost is significantly lower in India, and with the introduction of mandatory hallmarking and HUID numbers, the purity of gold in India is no longer a concern.Furthermore, NRIs in Dubai do not receive VAT refunds, and Indians travelling abroad only receive about 60% of the VAT back on their gold purchases. Gold trade analyst Bhargav Baidya suggests that the 1% duty differential between gold jewellery in India and Dubai will be offset by Indian jewellers offering discounts to retain and attract customers.Saurabh Gadgil, chairman of PNG Jewellers, notes that Indian import duty is now on par with the US, allowing Indian jewellers to offer competitive prices compared to other countries worldwide. The reduced customs duty is expected to make gold purchases in India more attractive and convenient for Indian consumers, potentially leading to a significant shift in their gold shopping preferences.","The reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers.

Gold Bonds losing sheen

Gold losing sheen? The government has reduced its target for issuing gold bonds in the financial year 2024-25 by 38% compared to the previous interim budget goal, according to a senior official. The revised target stands at Rs 18,500 crore, down from Rs 29,638 crore estimated in the interim budget and Rs 26,852 crore (revised estimate) in 2023-24.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told ET ""The decision followed a reassessment of various factors, including investor demand, other investment products and uncertainties around the global economy, as the situation has changed since the interim budget in February.""After accounting for redemptions, the net issuances of sovereign gold bonds are now estimated at Rs 15,000 crore for this fiscal year, a significant decrease from the Rs 26,138 crore projected in the interim budget and Rs 25,352 crore in the revised estimate for 2023-24.Harish Galipelli, director at ILA Commodities India, attributed this shift to retail investors increasingly opting for equities in anticipation of better returns. He also noted that people are uncertain about the potential for further increases in gold prices in the short-to-medium term following a recent rally. Additionally, Galipelli pointed out that savings in rural areas have been impacted by retail inflation and other factors.The gold bond and gold monetisation schemes were introduced by the government in late 2015 to discourage the physical purchase of precious metals and reduce imports, thereby mitigating the negative impact on the current account deficit.The gross collection through these two schemes is now projected to be Rs 20,030 crore in 2024-25, compared to Rs 31,168 crore in the interim budget and Rs 28,240 crore (revised estimate) in the previous fiscal year. Similarly, the net collection is estimated at Rs 16,433 crore, down from Rs 27,571 crore in the interim budget and Rs 26,653 crore in the previous year. However, the estimates for the gold monetisation scheme remain unchanged from the interim budget level.Also Read | Budget 2024: Duty cuts on gold, silver, platinum, and diamonds to make jewellery more affordable The sovereign gold bond scheme targets investors who view gold as an investment, encouraging them to purchase paper gold instead of physical gold.On the other hand, the gold monetisation scheme aims to bring out idle gold held by households, temple trusts, and others to increase domestic supply. Both schemes were designed to curb gold imports, which, along with crude oil, have been significant contributors to India's current account deficit.

In September, inflation fell to 1.8%, dipping below the ECB 's 2% target for the first time in three years.This is the third rate cut announced by the ECB since July after its governing council meeting in Slovenia's Llubljana instead of its usual location in Frankfurt, Germany.Inflation has been declining faster than expected, and analysts anticipate that the bank will further reduce rates in December. The eurozone's meager growth of just 0.3% in the second quarter has only reinforced the belief that ECB President Christine Lagarde will not attempt to alter this expectation.""The trends in the real economy and inflation support the case for lower rates,"" said Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank.One factor contributing to the global decrease in inflation is that central banks significantly raised borrowing costs from near-zero levels during the COVID-19 pandemic when prices began to surge, initially due to supply chain issues and later as a result of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which drove up energy prices.The ECB, established in 1999 with the introduction of the euro currency, started increasing interest rates in the summer of 2021, reaching a record high of 4% in September 2023 to control inflation by making borrowing more expensive for businesses and consumers.

At the UN climate conference in Baku, countries must agree on a new goal for international climate finance that truly meets the needs of developing nations, with public finance at its core, UN Climate Change Executive Secretary Simon Stiell said on Thursday. He said COP29 must be the ""stand-and-deliver"" COP, recognising that climate finance is critical to saving the global economy and billions of lives and livelihoods from the devastating impacts of climate change.Addressing a virtual event hosted by the Brookings Institution, Stiell said, ""At COP29 in Baku, all governments must agree on a new goal for international climate finance that truly responds to the needs of developing countries ... It is not my job to prejudge what the new goal will look like. But it is clear public finance must be at the core.""He added that as much of this finance as possible should be in the form of grants or concessional funding and made more accessible to those who need it most.""And we must make climate cash count, wherever possible, leveraging more private finance and sending signals to financial markets that green is where the gains are,"" he said.At this year's UN climate conference (COP29), countries are expected to agree on the New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG), the new amount developed nations must mobilise every year starting in 2025 to support climate action in developing countries.Under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), adopted in 1992, high-income industrialised countries are responsible for providing finance and technology to help developing nations combat and adapt to climate change.These developed countries, including the US, Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, the UK and EU member states such as Germany and France have historically benefited from industrialisation and contributed significantly to greenhouse gas emissions.At COP15 in Copenhagen in 2009, these nations pledged to provide USD 100 billion annually by 2020 to support developing countries.However, this target has not been fully met, creating a significant financial gap that has eroded trust and hindered climate action in developing nations.In May, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) reported that developed countries had surpassed the USD 100 billion-a-year target by providing nearly USD 116 billion in climate finance to developing countries in 2022, with nearly 70 per cent of the money provided in the form of loans.Stiell noted that the countries could decide ""who pays and how much"" at COP29 in Baku but cautioned, ""We are not going there to renegotiate the Paris Agreement"", referring to efforts by some developed nations to broaden the list of countries contributing to climate finance, with Switzerland and Canada proposing criteria to expand the donor base.Developing countries argue that discussions on expanding the contributor base go beyond the mandate for the NCQG and could derail negotiations on the new climate finance goal.Some developed nations, led by the EU and the US, argue that the global economic landscape has changed significantly since the adoption of the UNFCCC in 1992. They suggest that wealthier nations that have emerged during this period, such as China and some Gulf states, should also contribute to the new climate finance target.Developing countries view this as an attempt to shift responsibility away from those who have historically benefited from industrialization and contributed the most to greenhouse gas emissions.They argue that expecting them to contribute, especially when many are still grappling with poverty and inadequate infrastructure amid worsening climate impacts, undermines the principle of equity.Stiell also stressed the importance of implementing mechanisms to track and ensure that promised funds are delivered.""More work also has to be done to rapidly ramp up funding for adaptation and get international carbon markets working for everyone. We must fund a new generation of national climate plans.""To protect the progress we made at COP28 and convert the pledges in the UAE Consensus -- to triple renewable energy, double energy efficiency, boost adaptation, and transition away from fossil fuels -- into real-world, real-economy results,"" he said.The UN climate change chief warned that the world is at a moment of profound fracture between and within nations.""In times like these, there is a temptation to turn inward. A delusional belief that what happens in my neighbour's backyard is not my problem or concern.

The fourth quarter of 2024 is here, igniting anticipations of an end-of-year market surge. memecoins, as always, are making their way into crypto watchlists. These highly volatile assets are a favourite among degens, despite their silly themes and lack of utility.A top new memecoin to emerge into the spotlight is Flockerz (FLOCK). With a decentralised governance model and a passive staking system, the project has been drawing traction to its token presale.FLOCK has raised over $500,000 already.Play-to-earn is one of the most popular crypto earning and engagement mechanisms. The wide popularity of the niche is rooted in the video gaming sector. As the name implies, play-to-earn platforms reward users for playing.The growth of the play-to-earn sector catalysed more trends, like move-to-earn and stake-to-earn . These earning mechanisms integrate utility into crypto ecosystems and can potentially drive demand for the native tokens. Flockerz (FLOCK) is a memecoin. Themed around a growing flock of birds, the narrative is quirky. However, the project has bigger ambitions.Most memecoins fall prey to the whims of degens, which can send them into the dark depths of the market within days. In an effort to avoid being a statistic, Flockerz has integrated two earning mechanisms into its ecosystem.The first is vote-to-earn. It encourages investors to vote on crucial decisions concerning the future of the project in exchange for token rewards. The next is stake-to-earn, which encourages investors to hold on to their tokens and help stabilise the token economy.The project has garnered attention from crypto influencers like ClayBro who has a community of over 130,000 subscribers on YouTube.Flockerz is a memecoin that aims for, potentially, high standards of decentralisation. Although crypto projects are generally called decentralised, the principle is often limited to the protocol level. Most projects fail to fully embrace the decentralised spirit of blockchain technology.The governance and development are left to a few. While key decisions—like upgrades and management—need the guidance of industry experts, the concentration of power erodes the community ethos of the crypto market.A balance of power is desired in community-centric niches like memecoins. Flockerz seeks to achieve this through its vote-to-earn model. The goal is to give control back to the community, also called the Flock.This will be made possible through the FlockTopia DAO. It plans to implement decentralised governance with a unique vote-to-earn model, rewarding participants for their active role in decision-making.The vision is conveyed through an engaging narrative centred around the fictional King Birb, who became one with his degens and discovered the true power of the people.“Flockerz story is a testament that no single leader can dictate the future—here, it’s the community that rules,” claims the white paper The memecoin market is a highly slippery landscape where tokens can fly high and come crashing down within minutes. It is important to analyse tokenomics to understand its credibility.Flockerz has designated 25% of the FLOCK supply for staking rewards. The earning mechanism comes in addition to the vote-to-earn model. While vote-to-earn requires active participation, stake-to-earn is a more passive source of rewards. It incentivizes long-term holding to strengthen the token economy.It is popular in the memecoin market, as it can theoretically aid in mitigating early sell-offs. The staking rewards are structured dynamically. The earlier an investor joins, the higher the potential staking Annual Percentage Yield (APY) they can earn.The DAO Vault (Flock Vault) pools resources for the community. The liquidity allocation, on the other hand, is dedicated to facilitating trading across both centralised and decentralised exchanges post-launch.To win the confidence of early investors, Flockerz has undergone security audits by Solidproof and Coinsult. The audit reports are available on the official website.20% of the FLOCK supply is designated for the presale. Currently, during the presale stage, investors can buy $FLOCK tokens for $0.0056785. The price increases at each subsequent stage.The vote-to-earn model will go live after the presale in the third phase of the roadmap. But stake-to-earn is live. Over 34 million FLOCK tokens have already been staked.","Flockerz is a memecoin that aims for, potentially, high standards of decentralisation.

Airbus is set to cut up to 2,500 jobs in its satellite division , signaling further turbulence for the European aerospace sector, a source revealed Wednesday. The aviation giant has begun notifying worker representatives, though specific details of the job cuts remain unclear.As per the report, the layoffs are expected to hit the company’s defense and space division , which employs 35,000 people and accounted for €2 billion of Airbus’s €65.4 billion revenue last year.The division, once a leader in telecommunications satellites , has been struggling amid falling demand and heightened competition from the likes of SpaceX and its Starlink satellite constellation.Airbus's net profit plunged by 46% in the first half of 2024, largely due to a €989-million writedown in the space business. CEO Guillaume Faury acknowledged the division’s troubles during the company's financial report in July, noting, ""We are addressing the root causes of these issues.""This latest round of job cuts follows a €600-million charge taken by the division earlier in 2023. France's Thales, another major player in the industry, also restructured its space division earlier this year, reassigning 1,300 positions.Despite being the world leader in telecommunications satellites, Airbus is facing increased pressure as the market for custom-built telecommunication and navigation satellites contracts.","Airbus is set to cut up to 2,500 jobs in its satellite division, a source revealed Wednesday.

LVMH: LVMH sales fall 3% as China demand for luxury goods worsens,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/lvmh-sales-fall-3-as-china-demand-for-luxury-goods-worsens/articleshow/114280779.cms,"Representative image

Fashion, leather goods sales undershoot forecasts

French luxury giant LVMH reported a 3% fall in third-quarter sales on Tuesday, undershooting estimates in its first decline in quarterly sales since the pandemic as demand in China and Japan weakened, likely exacerbating investor worries.The world's biggest luxury group generated 19.08 billion euros ($20.8 billion) in revenue for the three months ending in September, a 3% fall on an organic basis, stripping out the effect of currencies, acquisitions and divestitures.The figure missed a consensus estimate of 2% organic growth cited by Barclays.The group ""badly"" undershot expectations, with ""misses across the board,"" said Luca Solca, an analyst at Bernstein.The sales report, the first of the quarter from the large luxury companies, comes after a rollercoaster for luxury stocks in recent weeks, as stimulus measures in China briefly fueled hopes of a recovery.Chinese consumer confidence has slumped to the all-time lows of the COVID-19 era, LVMH Chief Financial Officer Jean-Jacques Guiony said on an analyst call, though he added that the company still believed in the future of the market.The LVMH sales, and a bigger decline at smaller Italian firm Ferragamo, will do little to steady the market.""LVMH being the sector proxy for many, this print will inevitably cause more short-term volatility,"" said Flavio Cereda, co-manager of GAM's Luxury Brands investment strategy, a fund that owns shares in luxury stocks.The fashion and leather goods division, home to Louis Vuitton and Dior labels, reported a sales decline of 5%, well below consensus expectations for 4% growth, and the first fall for the business since 2020.""The fashion division saw slight improvement with Europeans and Americans but worse performance with Chinese and Japanese,"" Guiony said.Fashion and leather goods comprise almost half of LVMH revenue and nearly three-quarters of its recurring profit.In Asia - excluding Japan - of which the Chinese market is a dominant share, the sales decline worsened to a 16% slide from a 14% drop in the prior quarter.A post-pandemic spending spree lost momentum last year, and China's property crisis has weighed on shoppers' confidence. Hopes that government stimulus measures could quickly reignite enthusiasm for high-end merchandise have yet to be fulfilled.In Japan, LVMH said growth sharply slowed to 20% from the previous quarter's 57% jump due to a stronger yen.The results will likely be viewed negatively by the market, said Piral Dadhania, an analyst with RBC, noting they indicated a ""more pronounced slowdown than expected.""UBS has predicted that the third quarter will be the worst for the sector in four years, with a 1% decline in organic sales year-on-year.","World's biggest luxury group generated 19.08 billion euros ($20.8 billion) in revenue for the three months ending in September.

In 2024, we have witnessed a crypto bull run, in line with historical 4-year bitcoin cycles. And, in line with history, many feel that the altcoin market is about to pop. So, which cryptos should you consider adding to your portfolio before the year ends?Read more to find out!Bitcoin, as the first and most decentralised crypto, continues to lead the market.Its supremacy in the crypto world has been confirmed by the SEC’s approval of spot ETFs , which could potentially attract institutional investors to try Bitcoin.Despite global conflict and many large holders (such as the German Government) making a profit, Bitcoin is still sitting above $60,000, proving that the BTC price always ends up higher over time.While smaller cap coins have the potential to exceed Bitcoin’s ROI this year, one thing is sure - no crypto portfolio is complete without the ever-ascending Bitcoin.It’s called digital gold for a reason - bringing potential short-term gains but also long-term stability to crypto investors.Only in crypto could an (admittedly adorable) picture of a dog with a hat become an investment vehicle with a market cap of $2.2 billion. Dogwifhat is one of Solana’s most popular meme coins, and so offers exposure to Solana as well as WIF.Given that WIF has partnered with many trading platforms and is rumoured to have a listing on Coinbase, experts believe that WIF has the potential for a resurgence by the end of the year, potentially reaching $3 or more. That’s a 50% gain from today’s prices and a good ROI for any portfolio.Sui is one of many Layer 1 blockchains. But it’s currently undergoing many important technological advancements.Stablecoin USDC is now available directly on-chain (instead of needing to use the bridged version wUSDC). Since only USDC is fully backed by the dollar, this brings safety, liquidity, and increased interoperability to SUI.Stablecoins are a vital part of a healthy DeFi ecosystem, and so this move should increase SUI’s on-chain activity and TVL (Total Value Locked), therefore increasing the price of $SUI.The effects are already being seen, with SUI’s on-chain activity doubling on October 2nd and the price of SUI being up by 95% on the monthly charts.Furthermore, SUI is fast, scalable, and easy to develop.Although SUI has experienced a slight correction in the past few days, this could represent a great buying opportunity for the coin, which is up by 329% on the yearly charts. Cutoshi (CUTO) is a brand-new coin that is in presale. Based on the Chinese Lucky Cat, at first glance, Cutoshi seems like a memecoin. And it certainly has memecoin appeal.But the Cutoshi team has a mission - to bring DeFi to the masses while offering the fun and big potential gains of a viral memecoin.Cutoshi aims to position itself as the memecoin that stays true to Satoshi Nakamoto's vision. It is decentralised and anonymous and aims to provide financial freedom for its community.The team are building a decentralised exchange, a gamified yield farming platform and a learning academy to introduce new users to DeFi.Cutoshi has raised over $300,000 and is in the first stage of its presale at $0.15.While new coins present a higher risk than established coins like Bitcoin, they also bring the potential for the highest gains. Some predict that the coin could rise to around $1.25, which would represent a 700% gain for investors.","In 2024, we have witnessed a crypto bull run, in line with historical 4-year bitcoin cycles.

Several analysts nonetheless flagged Total's refining margin drop in particular as weaker than expected, with Oddo BHF analyst Ahmed Ben Salem calling the price drop a ""collapse"" and RBC analyst Biraj Borkhataria cutting his third-quarter net income estimate for the company by 480 million euros.Total's overall quarterly hydrocarbon production is expected to be at 2.4 million barrels of oil-equivalent per day (Mboe/d), at the lower end of guidance given in second-quarter results. The company cited security-related disruptions in Libya, where a dispute between rival governments caused oilfield shutdowns, and an August outage at the Australian Ichthys LNG plant, in which Total holds a 30 per cent stake, which left the site running at half-capacity into October.That loss of production was partly offset by ramping up the 180kb/d Mero 2 oil development in Brazil, where Total holds a 19.3 per cent stake.Total's average LNG price for the quarter was $9.91 per million British thermal units - having guided around $10/Mbtu at Q2 results - with integrated LNG results expected to be above $1 billion, versus $1.3 billion a year ago, due to lower market volatility and production.Results for the Integrated Power division are expected to be broadly in line with the second quarter.The company will release third-quarter results on October 31.","TotalEnergies' shares were around 4 per cent lower at 59.94 euros by 0940 GMT, moving broadly in line with peers.

"China may raise $850 billion in new debt over three years to spur growth, says report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/china-may-raise-850-billion-in-new-debt-over-three-years-to-spur-growth-says-report/articleshow/114244834.cms,"Challenging task

China may raise an additional 6 trillion yuan ($850 billion) from special treasury bonds over three years to stimulate a sagging economy, local media reported, a figure that failed to revive sentiment in the country's stock market.The Caixin Global report, which cited sources with knowledge of the matter, comes after Finance Minister Lan Foan on Saturday said Beijing will ""significantly increase"" debt, although the absence of details on the size and timing of the fiscal measures disappointed some investors.The size of the expected fiscal package has been the subject of intense speculation in financial markets. Chinese shares hit two-year-highs earlier this month on news of the stimulus, before retreating in the absence of official details.On Tuesday, stocks dipped about 0.3 per cent, suggesting little excitement among investors about the reported amount, although analysts say it would at least stabilise growth in the near-term.""This is in line with our expectations,"" said Xing Zhaopeng, ANZ's senior China strategist. ""For next year, we still think a growth target of around 5 per cent is likely to be maintained. So, for a 5 per cent growth rate, that should be enough.""Reuters reported last month that China planned to issue special sovereign bonds worth about 2 trillion yuan ($285 billion) this year as part of fresh fiscal stimulus .Data in recent months, including Monday's trade and new lending figures for September, missed expectations, raising concern that China may not reach this year's roughly 5 per cent growth target and will struggle to fend off deflationary pressures.Economic growth is expected to slow to 4.5 per cent in the third quarter from 4.7 per cent in the second, then see a late rebound on the back of stimulus to hit 4.8 per cent for the whole year, a Reuters poll showed on Tuesday.In late September, authorities unleashed monetary stimulus and property sector support measures. Soon after, a meeting of top Communist Party leaders, the Politburo, vowed the ""necessary spending"" to bring growth back on track.""The probability of reaching a growth rate of about 5 per cent at least in 2024 and 2025 would increase a lot,"" Bruce Pang, chief China economist at Jones Lang LaSalle, said of the impact of the reported 6 trillion figure.The Caixin article published late on Monday said the funds would be partly used to help local governments resolve their off-the-books debts, according to the sources. The reported amount is equivalent to nearly 5 per cent of China's economic output.The International Monetary Fund estimates central government debt at 24 per cent of economic output. But the fund calculates overall public debt, including that of local governments, at about $16 trillion, or 116 per cent of GDP.""Unless the central government voluntarily increases leverage, investment will remain weak, as local governments are saddled with heavy debt and corporate balance sheets are being eroded by a weak economy,"" said Xia Haojie, bond analyst at Guosen Futures.A severe downturn in the property sector since 2021 has shrunk local government revenues, as a large portion of their income had relied on auctioning land to real estate developers.The property crisis has weighed on consumer and business activity, exposing China's overreliance on external markets and government-led, debt-driven investment in infrastructure and manufacturing.Low wages, high youth unemployment and a feeble social safety net mean China's household spending is less than 40 per cent of annual economic output, some 20 percentage points below the global average. Investment, by comparison, is 20 points above.As a result, China contributes much more to the global economy as a producer than it does as a consumer, which has sparked trade tensions with the United States, Europe and a number of emerging markets. U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump has called for 60 per cent tariffs on all Chinese goods if he wins next month's election.These imbalances are fanning concerns over China's long-term growth potential irrespective of the near-term fiscal impulse.""Consistently hitting 5 per cent over the next few years will still be a challenging task, especially if China faces a less supportive external demand situation,"" said Lynn Song, ING's greater China chief economist.The finance ministry said the looming fiscal stimulus would provide subsidies to low-income households, support indebted local governments and the property market and replenish state banks' capital.The remaining details are expected to emerge at a meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the top legislative body, likely to be called in coming weeks.","China may raise an additional 6 trillion yuan ($850 billion) from special treasury bonds over three years.
