"After 30-month wait, Wipro rescinds offer to freshers",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/after-30-month-wait-wipro-rescinds-offer-to-freshers/articleshow/112850613.cms,"BENGALURU: After nearly 30 months since extending job offers, Wipro has revoked offer letters to freshers , citing that some candidates failed to meet the eligibility criteria by not successfully completing the mandatory pre-skilling training.In an email sent to the affected candidates, Wipro stated, ""As communicated to you earlier... successful completion of the pre-skilling training is a pre-requisite for onboarding.""Ayush Srivastava, one of the candidates who received the rejection letter, expressed his disappointment on LinkedIn, writing, ""I have been subjected to a prolonged waiting period and a rigorous 10-day training process only to have my employment prospects unceremoniously terminated.""In response to queries from TOI, Wipro explained, ""As part of our routine onboarding process, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation to ensure that our next-gen associates are assigned to the right client projects and have the most up-to-date skillset to make an immediate impact.We expect every entry-level employee to have a certain level of proficiency in their designated area of work, aligned with the requirements of the business and our clients.""Last year, Wipro discontinued the Velocity skilling programme, which allowed an 'Elite' fresher candidate to upgrade to the 'Turbo' category and earn a higher salary. This programme had been an integral part of Wipro's hiring process in recent times. Candidates recruited under the Elite programme for freshers are offered Rs 3.5 lakh per annum, while those upgraded to Turbo receive Rs 6.5 lakh per annum. In an email communication to new hires, the company had offered Velocity candidates the role of a project engineer at Rs 3.5 lakh annual salary.Recently, the Nascent Information Technology Senate (NITES), a union representing IT employees, lodged a complaint against Infosys for failing to onboard freshers who were hired as system engineers and digital specialist engineers in 2022-23.LTIMindtree had mandated freshers to clear a seven-week training programme to be onboarded. In 2023, the company instructed those with offer letters from 2022 to attend a six to seven-week training programme with three milestones. Candidates had to achieve over 60% in each milestone to be onboarded.Freshers are facing delayed onboarding as the Indian IT services sector grapples with a subdued growth environment, with clients curtailing their discretionary spending. Due to fewer projects and over-hiring during the pandemic, top IT firms have chosen to stagger their fresher onboarding process.","Wipro has revoked offer letters to freshers, citing that some candidates failed to meet the eligibility criteria.

'India a bright spot'

RIL AGM 2024 : Mukesh Ambani , the billionaire chairman and managing director of Reliance Industries Ltd, announced the company's next phase of growth during a shareholders' meeting on Thursday. He outlined plans for the retail and telecom divisions to each surpass $100 billion in value, while aiming to double revenues and pre-tax profit within the next 3-4 years.Additionally, Ambani projected that the new energy business would become profitable by 2031, with the core oil and chemical business continuing to serve as a robust growth engine for the conglomerate.Reliance, which has diverse interests spanning refining, oil and gas, petrochemicals, telecoms, retail, and media, is on a trajectory to more than double in size before the end of the decade, according to Ambani.As the oil and chemicals business continues to be a growing cash cow, Reliance plans to intensify its adoption of AI technologies. The company will introduce 'Jio Brain' - a suite of AI tools and platforms - and establish gigawatt scale IA-ready data centres in Jamnagar, Gujarat, ""to create the world's lowest AI inferencing cost,"" making such applications more affordable in India compared to anywhere else in the world.Ambani said that three of the company's five growth engines have a valuation exceeding $100 billion each and are poised for even faster growth in the future. These growth engines include the oil-to-chemical (O2C) business, which encompasses oil refinery and petrochemical plants, the retail division, which consists of both online and physical stores, and the telecom and digital venture, Jio.""Jio and Retail are expected to double their revenues and EBITDA in the next 3-4 years,"" he said, highlighting the immense potential for growth in these sectors. Additionally, Ambani expressed his optimism about the company's new energy business, which he believes will become a significant and profitable venture for Reliance over the next 5-7 years, comparable to the success of their O2C business, which has been built over the past four decades.Looking ahead, Ambani identified green fuels and AI-based solutions as long-term growth engines for Reliance. These emerging technologies and sustainable initiatives are expected to play a crucial role in the company's future success and contribute to its ongoing expansion and profitability.Mukesh Ambani began his address to shareholders at the RIL AGM by congratulating PM Narendra Modi for securing a record third term. Ambani said that a notice has been sent to the stock exchange that the Board of Directors will be meeting on September 5, 2024 to vote on the issue of announcing bonus shares in the ratio of 1:1.Since January 1, 2000, Reliance Industries has not split the face value of its shares. However, the company has issued two bonus shares, both at a 1:1 ratio, since November 26, 2009. The most recent bonus issue had an ex-date of September 7, 2017, according to an ET report.Mukesh Ambani said that his conglomerate, which spans from oil to telecom, is not focused on generating short-term profits or accumulating wealth for its own sake. Instead, the company's primary goal is to create wealth for the nation as a whole.During his speech, Ambani highlighted Reliance's commitment to ensuring India's energy security. He also noted that the company has undergone a transformation, evolving into a deep tech enterprise that now produces its own technology rather than merely consuming it.Mukesh Ambani announced that the company is undergoing a transformation into a deep tech entity. He emphasized the significance of AI as a groundbreaking development in human evolution, opening up possibilities to tackle intricate challenges faced by humanity.Ambani expressed confidence that Reliance's strategic embrace of deep tech and advanced manufacturing will propel the company into the global top-30 league in the near future, assuring that the future holds even greater promise than the past. He highlighted Jio's position as a genuine deep tech innovator.""As I told you last year, Reliance has now become a net producer of technology. Breakthrough technologies and innovation have always been the greatest wealth creators for nations, as well as for corporates. Reliance internalised this 'Vikas Mantra' at every stage of our growth,"" Ambani said.Reliance is undergoing a transformation into a deep tech company with advanced manufacturing capabilities through several means. Firstly, the company is integrating innovative technologies into every business to generate increased value for customers. Secondly, Reliance's skilled engineers and scientists are developing critical technological innovations in-house to enhance product and service offerings. Lastly, the company has established an AI-native digital infrastructure for all its businesses and has built its own software stack, integrating end-to-end workflows and real-time dashboards.Mukesh Ambani announced at Reliance Industries' AGM that the company will establish gigawatt-scale, AI-ready data centers in Jamnagar, Gujarat. He also highlighted Reliance's goal of achieving the world's lowest AI inferencing costs. Ambani noted that the advent of AI has created new opportunities to tackle complex challenges facing humanity.""The birth of AI has opened up opportunities to address complex problems facing humans,"" Ambani said, recognizing the potential of artificial intelligence to tackle significant challenges. Ambani also unveiled the Jio AI Cloud Welcome offer, which provides Jio users with 100 GB of free cloud storage.Ambani announced that the company is making significant strides in the new energy sector. The group is on track to invest the committed Rs 75,000 crore in establishing a new energy ecosystem. The production of solar photovoltaic (PV) modules is set to begin by the end of this year, with the goal of achieving the first phase of integrated solar production facilities in the subsequent quarters. ""The integration will include modules, cells, glass, wafers, ingot, and polysilicon, with an initial annual capacity of 10 GW.""Furthermore, Reliance has started constructing an integrated advanced chemistry-based battery manufacturing facility with a 30 GWh annual capacity at Jamnagar. The production is expected to commence by the second half of next year. The company has also initiated work on establishing a fully automated, multi-GW electrolyser manufacturing facility on the west coast of India, which is scheduled to be ready by 2026. ""This giga-factory will be fully adaptable, capable of supporting various technologies such as Alkaline, PEM, and AEM,"" Ambani stated.In addition to these projects, Reliance has leased arid wasteland in Kutch, just 250 kilometres from Jamnagar. Ambani emphasized the potential of this wasteland, stating, ""This wasteland has the potential to generate about 150 billion units of electricity in the next 10 years - providing nearly 10 per cent of India's energy requirements."" The company has already started significant project development work and is building its transmission infrastructure to bring online solar generation projects.Moreover, Reliance has secured access to nearly 2,000 acres of land at Kandla port to facilitate the production, storage, evacuation, and shipping of green fuels to markets in India and abroad. These developments showcase Reliance's commitment to the new energy sector and its efforts to contribute to India's energy requirements while promoting sustainable solutions.Mukesh Ambani announced last year that his three children - Akash, Isha, and Anant - had been appointed to the company's board as part of the succession planning process. On Thursday, he acknowledged their increased responsibilities within the organization.Akash is responsible for overseeing the telecom venture, while Isha manages the retail business. Anant is in charge of a new energy initiative. The retail business, which comprises approximately 19,000 stores across more than 7,000 cities and an e-commerce platform, ranks among the top 10 global retailers by market capitalization and the top 30 by revenues.Jio, the telecom arm, boasts 490 million users and handles 8 per cent of global mobile traffic, having completed its 5G rollout. Ambani stated that Jio aims to provide its broadband service, JioAirfiber, to 100 million homes while also developing large-scale AI infrastructure to make AI accessible to all.In the O2C (Oil to Chemicals) business, Reliance is expanding capacities across PVC and polyester, and constructing India's first carbon fibre plant in Hazira, Gujarat.Ambani spoke of the global economy, the hope that revolutionary breakthroughs in science like Artificial Intelligence offer, and the concerns surrounding geopolitical conflicts. “World today brings hope and concerns, on one hand we are living with scientific breakthrough like artificial intelligence, we are promised proprietary. The birth of AI has opened up opportunities to help solve multiple problems, but geopolitical tensions threaten to challenge global economy,” said Mukesh Ambani.Mukesh Ambani also highlighted that India remains the 'brightest beacon of hope' for the world. He added that IMF's projections of India surpassing Japan and Germany to become the world's third largest economy in the coming years, means that by the time India hits the 80th year of Independence, we would have achieved this milestone.""Our future is far brighter than our past. For example, Reliance took over two decades to be amongst the Top 500 companies globally. The following two decades saw us joining the league of the world’s Top-50 most valuable companies. With our strategic adoption of Deep-Tech and Advance Manufacturing, I can clearly see Reliance earning a place in the Top-30 League in the near future,” he said.","Mukesh Ambani announced the company's next phase of growth during a shareholders' meeting on Thursday. He outlined plans for the retail and telecom divisions to each surpass $100 billion in value, while aiming to double revenues and pre-tax profit within the next 3-4 years.

Foreign investors dump $3.42 billion worth ‘expensive Indian stocks’; opt for IPOs instead,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/foreign-investors-dump-3-42-billion-worth-expensive-indian-stocks-opt-for-ipos-instead/articleshow/112829480.cms,"Foreign investors are selling their positions in pricey Indian equities and opting for new offerings in primary markets as they pursue more affordable access to the market and higher returns. Their selling has been motivated by profit-taking as Indian stocks trade at all-time highs and at valuations exceeding those of most major stock markets, according to a Reuters report.Instead, investors are investing in initial public offerings ( IPOs ), where valuations are lower and there is less competition for stocks.According to India's Central Depository Services Ltd data quoted by Reuters, foreigners have sold a net $3.42 billion worth of equities in the secondary market so far, while purchasing a net $1.47 billion through primary market issuances this month.A Societe Generale (SG) report reveals that foreigners have acquired more than $6 billion of stocks on the primary market this year, the highest since 2021.""Foreign investors are shying from deploying funds into secondary market for long term and seeing better and faster return prospects in the primary market,"" said Rajat Agarwal, Asia equity strategist at SG.Also Read | Who are India’s richest investors?

The current Banking Regulation Act permits single or joint deposit holders to appoint a nominee for their deposit, items left in the custody of a bank, or a locker hired from a bank.In the event of the nominator's death, the nominee can access the deposit, articles, or locker.According to an ET report, the new Bill suggests allowing up to four nominees for these purposes. For deposits, nominees can be appointed either successively or simultaneously, while for other purposes, they can only be appointed successively.When there are multiple simultaneous nominees, the nomination will be effective in a predetermined proportion. In the case of successive nominations, priority will be given to the nominee named higher in the nomination order.""The Banking Regulation Act allows single or joint deposit holders to appoint a nominee for their deposit.

Check List Nomination is a crucial aspect of opening lockers and savings accounts in India. The Indian Banks' Association (IBA) says, ""Banking Companies (Nomination) Rules 1985 permits banks to pay dues to nominees in the event of death of depositor(s) without asking for succession certificate or verifying claims of legal heirs. This simplifies settlement. Of course, as Trustee the nominee is accountable to legal heirs.The IBA further clarifies that the nomination facility is available for bank deposits, safe deposit lockers, and safe custody articles. A single deposit account, whether held individually or jointly, can have only one nominee. However, a jointly held locker can have two nominees. In the case of a minor's account, a person legally empowered to operate the account can file a nomination on behalf of the minor.The State Bank of India emphasizes the importance of availing the benefits of nomination facility and survivorship clause for locker-hirers. In the unfortunate event of the death of one of the joint locker-hirers, the contents of the locker do not automatically transfer to the surviving joint locker-hirer or nominee(s) unless there is a survivorship clause or nomination in place.When renting a locker, the bank charges a nominal annual rent based on the size of the locker and the location of the branch. The rent should be paid in advance for the financial year. The bank provides a copy of the signed Locker Agreement to the locker-hirer, outlining their rights and responsibilities.","The Banking Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2024 proposes to increase the number of nominees allowed per bank account and locker from one to four.

Highest Fixed Deposit Interest Rates: Fixed deposits (FDs) offered by banks are secure and interest-generating investment options. With FDs, you can expect a guaranteed return on your invested funds, which remain unaffected by market fluctuations. This is the reason that FDs are a go to investment option for most risk averse investors.Interest rates for fixed deposits are near all time highs, with RBI pausing the rate cycle for several monetary policy meetings now.Investors have the flexibility to choose between the re-investment deposit option, which allows for the accumulation of compound interest, or the option to receive interest payments at regular intervals (monthly/quarterly) to support their financial planning and budgeting needs, notes an ET report.The interest rates offered on fixed deposits in August 2024 can vary based on several factors, including the specific bank, the age of the depositor, the tenure of the deposit, and the amount invested.In India, private banks are financial institutions where private companies or individuals hold the majority of the equity, in contrast to public-sector banks where the government is the primary shareholder.Public Sector Undertaking (PSU) banks are ones where the government owns the majority of the shares. These banks receive government subsidies with the aim of facilitating their growth and expansion.For investors interested in comparing fixed deposit interest rates between private and public sector banks, a brief analysis of the fixed deposit rates offered to both general citizens and senior citizens is provided below.","Public Banks: Latest Fixed Deposit Interest Rates For General Citizens.

Reliance plans 1:1 bonus stock issue after 7 years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/reliance-plans-11-bonus-stock-issue-after-7-years/articleshow/112910034.cms,"The corporate action doesn't lead to any change in the investment value of the stock as the share price gets adjusted accordingly.

Size To Double:

Expansion Moves:

MUMBAI: Reliance Industries , India's most valued company, will consider a 1:1 bonus share at its Sept 5 board meeting, its chairman Mukesh Ambani told shareholders on Thursday. This will be RIL's sixth bonus share issuance since it got listed in 1977. The last time it issued bonus shares (also in the ratio of 1:1) was in 2017 when it celebrated its 40th post-IPO anniversary.The move comes as RIL seeks to reward its shareholders amid robust financial performance and aggressive growth plans for its diversified businesses.In FY24, RIL posted a record net profit of Rs 79,020 crore. ""When Reliance grows, we reward our shareholders handsomely. And when our shareholders are rewarded handsomely, Reliance grows faster and creates more value,"" said Ambani at the company's 47th post-IPO annual general meeting.In a bonus share offering, a company issues free shares to its existing shareholders by capitalising on its reserves.However, this will boost the stock's liquidity. After the bonus share issuance, RIL's share capital will double to Rs 13,532 crore from the current base of Rs 6,766 crore.Ambani said RIL is on track to more than double in size before the end of this decade, cementing its position as one of the most valuable companies in the world. In FY24, it had a revenue of Rs 10 lakh crore ($120 billion). The company's digital services (Jio) and retail units will double their revenues and operating profits in the next 3-4 years, while the new energy business- ""the new jewel in RIL's crown"" will become big and profitable as its oil-to-chemicals (O2C) business over the next 5-7 years, the chairman said. The new energy business consists of solar photovoltaic and fuel cell manufacturing, energy storage and green hydrogen production. Currently, O2C is the largest contributor to RIL's revenue and operating profit. Ambani, however, didn't touch on the potential listing of Jio and the retail units at the AGM.Jio is developing a comprehensive suite of artificial intelligence (AI) tools and platforms called Jio Brain and is establishing AI-ready data centers in Jamnagar, Gujarat, which will run on green energy.""Our goal is to create the world's lowest AI inferencing cost in India. This will make AI applications more affordable than anywhere else,"" Ambani said.By the end of this year, RIL will commence the production of solar photo-voltaic modules and will complete the first phase of integrated solar production facilities in the following quarters, Ambani said. ""Green fuels and AI-based solutions will become long-term growth engines for Reliance,"" Ambani said.","Reliance Industries will consider a 1:1 bonus share at its Sept 5 board meeting.

In the span of a year, the startup's valuation has more than tripled. Zepto had turned unicorn after investors infused about $235 million into the company at a valuation of $1.4 billion in Aug last year.The fresh investment is an extension of its funding round as part of which the quick commerce startup had garnered $665 million in funding from investors at a valuation of $3.6 billion in June. Dragon Fund and Epiq Capital joined the firm's cap table in the follow on round while existing backers such as StepStone, Lightspeed, DST, and Contrary also participated and increased their stakes.The quick commerce space has piqued investor interest amid rising consumer adoption of 10-15 minute delivery services. The convenience of rapid deliveries of a range of items at the customer's doorstep has led more people to sign up platforms like Zepto, Blinkit and Swiggy Instamart which allow them to save time and stock up on household items with ease at any hour of the day. All three companies have expanded beyond groceries to deliver a host of other items ranging from trolley bags, toys, kitchen appliances to headphones and occasionally even iPhones. With quick commerce firms foraying into categories which had traditionally been the domain of e-commerce players, deep pocketed companies like Flipkart have also entered the space.Zepto's total fund count so far stands at over $1.5 billion. ""The rationale behind this follow-on financing was two-fold. First, the opportunity to bring onboard a lead investor of Neeraj Arora's calibre from General Catalyst was one we couldn't pass on. Second, strengthening our balance sheet is a strategic move, particularly as the company continues to deliver robust growth and operating leverage,"" Aadit Palicha, co-founder & CEO at Zepto said in a statement. In an interview to TOI in June, Palicha had said that the company has been able to grow its sales and are quite close to overall ebitda break even.Zepto, co-founded by Palicha and fellow Stanford dropout Kaivalya Vohra in 2021, plans to expand into newer cities beyond the big metros like Coimbatore and Lucknow going ahead.

Why it’s time to explore bold & path-breaking alternatives that put Indian Railways on a smooth track,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-its-time-to-explore-bold-path-breaking-alternatives-that-put-indian-railways-on-a-smooth-track/articleshow/112317406.cms,"By Ashutosh Bhandari

Railway Budget 2024 : The government has wavered little in its efforts to spur a modernisation of railways in the country, pivoting on technology, to support the country’s economic ambitions. In line with expectations, Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore, marking yet another year of successive increase in outlay.That takes forward the past policies and the government’s vision, which have paved the way for modernisation of the transport behemoth.In earlier decades, the government had focused on laying tracks on new routes, electrification and incremental rolling stock capacity addition. That was the need of the hour back then and has helped set up the base for a larger transformation.For instance, the massive Dedicated Freight Corridor ( DFC ) as well as locomotive factories at Marhaura and Madhepura in Bihar were conceptualised over a decade ago and we are seeing their completion now.More recently, the focus has shifted to modernisation—of rolling stock and safety systems, among other aspects.This year, emphasis has also been laid on the railways’ crucial role in industrial development. Commodity-specific corridors have been planned in eastern India and impetus given to port connectivity. Vande Bharat and technology-led upgrades in rolling stock remain in focus. Safety has been prioritised through budgetary allocations for the anti-collision systemKavach . That said, there are other cogs in the wheel that demand attention from a long-term perspective.First, the target for the Operating Ratio, the crucial efficiency gauge, has been set at 98.22% for 2024-25, compared with 98.65% in 2023-24. This reflects an imminent need for operational transformation. An effective overhaul of the world’s fourth-largest rail network will take many years and thus we need to start focusing on improving efficiency and reducing costs now.DFC is almost entirely operational and will be complete over the next few months. To ensure the project achieves its twin goals of reducing logistics costs and enhancing freight efficiency, railways need to attract more cargo on the corridor. This will help increase the rail coefficient and make the railways’ approach more market-oriented, which will in turn aid future corridors.A revamp of railway stations is on track, with sufficient funds dedicated to this end. But even though new coaches and wagons are increasingly being added to meet footfalls, the stations and passenger trains themselves remain synonymous with chaos.Just as safety, comfort and convenience have been prioritised, there is a need for solutions to address the capacity and demand challenges. As a first step, the government could target development of new stations and setting up of new coach production units.As a leading freight mover, Indian Railways carried a record 1,588 MT cargo in fiscal 2024, up from 1,095 MT in fiscal 2015. It accounts for 26% of the cargo moved in the country—by no means an easy feat. The railways aims to take this volume to 3,000 MT by 2030, which would require a 11% CAGR against the around 4.2% witnessed over the last 10 years. As per a report by TERI and Shakti Foundation, from carrying about 62% of freight traffic in 1990-91, Indian Railways’ share has declined to ~27% in 2014-15. This has been due to the expanding road network, cost competitiveness over railways, and door-to-door service. Thus, commencing the cycle of increasing the rail share again is commendable.DFCs, a high-capacity track network, high-power locomotives and improvement in wagon designs have set the ball rolling for larger capacity, faster freight trains that deliver better efficiency.Yet, achieving exponential growth is a tall ask given the current dynamics. Possibly, similar challenges might apply to other goals the railways might have for 2047.To be fair, despite its scale and complexity, Indian Railways has been able to achieve diverse developments at commendable speed.But the track ahead is long and it is time to start discussing the reinvention of the institutional set-up.Indian Railways sees substantial private sector involvement in the form of vendors and contractors. Policymakers could start mulling extreme options such as parallel privately-owned and operated railway infrastructure, coupled with centralised planning and an evolved role for the railways. This will need a robust policy framework from the Government of India.The time is perhaps also ripe to bring user charge and asset monetisation-driven segments for passengers as well as cargo to the discussion table. Globally, the separation of infrastructure and operations in railways has delivered mixed results, for example in the United Kingdom. The model should be analysed and revisited to understand its potential relevance in the Indian context.The key would be to retrace our steps and align our long-term goals to identify not just incremental changes but also ways to explore bold and path-breaking alternatives that put Indian Railways on a smooth track and bring it up to speed.","Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore.

Budget 2024 capital gains tax changes: The Narendra Modi government is considering suggestions for tweaks in the new long term capital gains tax regime that was announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman in Union Budget 2024.The July 23 budget reduced the LTCG tax on property from 20% to 12.5%. The indexation benefit, which allowed taxpayers to adjust the acquisition cost for inflation before calculating capital gains and thus reduce their tax liability, is proposed to be eliminated for properties purchased on or after April 1, 2001.The government publishes the Cost Inflation Index (CII) annually for this calculation.India Inc is appealing to the government for a gradual shift to the long-term capital gains tax regime proposed in the FY25 budget, which aims to eliminate indexation benefits for property, gold, and other unlisted assets.According to an ET report by Deepshikha Sikarwar, the industry is suggesting alternatives such as a higher tax rate with indexation or a lower rate of 12.5% without indexation, as well as some form of grandfathering for ancestral properties.The finance ministry is currently reviewing these proposals and will discuss them with the Prime Minister's Office. The final decision will be made closer to the date when the Finance Bill reply is to be presented in Parliament, the reports said.Industry groups are expected to submit formal proposals to the finance ministry in the near future.

Budget 2024 adopts multifaceted approach to bolstering manufacturing sector,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2024-adopts-multifaceted-approach-to-bolstering-manufacturing-sector/articleshow/112216383.cms,"By Saurabh Agarwal and Mohit Sharma

Budget 2024 for manufacturing sector : The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth. While the middle class has been offered tax relief, the government's primary focus remains on judicious spending to maximize economic impact. The budget's core themes are employment, skilling, MSME development, and support for the middle class.Largely focus has remained intact on spending money judiciously to ensure that each penny spent creates a ripple effect in the entire economic landscape.Although at first glance, manufacturing might appear to have taken a backseat, a deeper analysis reveals a multifaceted approach to bolstering the sector. Initiatives like employment-linked benefits and internship programs, while primarily aimed at job creation and skill development, indirectly benefit manufacturing companies by expanding the talent pool.Extensive focus on the MSME manufacturing units by way of extending term loan facility for purchase of machinery and equipment without collateral or third-party guarantee, would help companies in augmenting their capital base/ capacity and strengthen the very foundation of the manufacturing ecosystem in the country. Development of a new credit-assessment model by Public Sector Banks to assess MSME credit shall provide much needed regulatory relief to the units.With respect to the large manufacturing entities, while there is no direct fiscal/ tax incentive introduced in this budget, some support has been provided with an extensive focus on development of ‘industrial parks’ in nearly 100 cities under the ‘plug and play’ model. Reforms proposed with respect to land administration, planning and management, shall also ease out acquisition related difficulties often faced by entrepreneurs/ business houses in acquiring lands for manufacturing set-ups.Targeted Customs duty interventions like, rationalization of Customs duty provisions in Mobile phone manufacturing setups, extension of Customs duty exemption on import of capital goods for manufacturing of solar cells and panels, full Customs duty exemption on import of 25 critical minerals,, shall provide the required impetus for enhancing domestic manufacturing environment.Governments’ focus on formulating an Economic Policy Framework to set the scope for next-gen reforms in the country, has a target to improve the productivity of factors of production, namely, land, labour, capital, entrepreneurship and technology. This shall pave the way for enabling achievement of a target of 25% manufacturing sector contribution to the nation’s GDP over the course of next 7-10 years.While the overall outlook is positive, the extension of tax benefits under Section 115BAB for manufacturing entities and the absence of new PLI schemes are notable omissions.The country’s manufacturing base is expanding as is reflective from the continuously increasing tax collections and expanding Purchasing Manager’s Index. It would be pertinent to see how the ground realities evolve vis-à-vis the vision envisaged, in the upcoming Financial Year.","The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth.

Budget 2024: Armed with the vision to propel India to become a developed country by 2047, the Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business thereby providing the required stimulus to the manufacturing sector and enabling large scale job creation.On the Indirect tax front, the industry welcomes the much-needed announcement for a comprehensive review of the rate structure under Customs enabling ease in product classification and dispute reduction. The proposal of lowering of Customs duty on a plethora of raw materials and products including solar cells, critical minerals and bullion are encouraging measures. The rationale behind such reduction clearly indicates support towards domestic manufacturing, deepening value addition and supporting targets in reducing carbon footprint.Relevant amendments under the Customs law have been made to provide increased time limits for re-imports and re-exports to enhance competitiveness of the fledgling MRO sector. The government has extended significant duty reduction and exemption benefits to the healthcare and electronics sectors, continuing the impetus of incentives provided under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme.Since their introduction in March 2020, the PLI schemes have indeed supported in revitalizing the manufacturing sector and strengthening the necessary supply chains. The success achieved in the mobile manufacturing sector has now enabled the Government to reduce customs duties on mobile phones and components, signalling a mature environment. The Budget proposals aim at reproducing similar outcomes for semiconductor and pharmaceutical industry by increasing the budgetary allocation.Buoyed by the increasing revenue collection under GST signalling a shift towards a mature tax regime, this Budget has harmonized the timeframes for the issuance of demand notices and adjudication orders for cases involving fraud, suppression or otherwise. Significant amendments to the GST legislations have been introduced reflecting the recommendations proposed by the GST Council such as regularizing non-levy of GST due to general practice which may turn out to be a breather for certain impacted industries reeling under huge tax demands.The Insurance sector has been provided much relief through the GST council recommendations which have been cemented in the present budget thereby ending long standing disputes on their business practices.The Government's efforts to push forward with its reform agenda are evident as plans to incentivize states for their business reform actions plans and digitalization through the Jan Vishwas Bill 2.0 is proposed. Further, setting up of e-commerce export hubs is envisaged to facilitate easier access to international markets for domestic players.The recent implementation of Budget proposals allows the government to maintain momentum in its reform agenda. These policy measures implicitly reaffirm the significance of India Inc as a crucial element in the development of infrastructure. However, there are still some expectations required to be met to march towards a Viksit Bharat 2047.",The Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business.

Budget 2024 : Real estate, a significant contributor to employment generation, has received a fair bit of attention in Budget 2024-25. Recent years have seen the sector transform rapidly, driven by factors such as favourable government policies, Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, strong economic growth and changing consumer preferences.Added to that, the budgetary focus on job creation, skilling and employment-linked incentives, infrastructure, urban development, rural connectivity, digitalisation and land-related norms, all dovetail to promote growth of the sector.Launched in June 2015, the PMAY aims to provide affordable housing to all eligible beneficiaries. The budget unveiled PMAY Urban 2.0, under which the housing needs of 1 crore urban poor and middle class will be addressed with an investment of Rs 10 lakh crore.The central government’s additional Rs 2.2 lakh crore injection in the next 5 years to make housing more affordable has the potential to revitalise the affordable housing market.Such an approach can play an important role in realising the government's vision of Housing for All and push growth and development. Hence, the significant investment under PMAY Urban 2.0 is expected to alleviate urban housing deficits, spurring construction and economic growth.Steps to introduce technological reforms within the regulatory framework for land, such as digitalisation or GIS mapping of land records, will improve transparency.Rationalisation of stamp duty across states will also be critical to bring in uniformity and initiate land-related reforms such as urban planning, usage and building bylaws.These are steps in the right direction and will boost growth. Moreover, they will improve the ease of property transactions and strengthen municipal finances through increased property taxes. Rationalization of stamp duty with an emphasis on women homebuyers may boost home-buyer sentiment in major cities, too.The budget has also given ample attention to urban and rural development, with rental housing for industrial workers through the public private partnership model, interest subsidies for rental housing, and transit-oriented developments.The proposal to develop investment-ready plug-and-play industrial parks in 100 cities may attract industrial investment, leading to increased demand for industrial real estate and support the growth of ancillary services and residential developments in these regions.Initiatives for industrial parks and rental housing for industrial workers align with the country’s manufacturing goals and addresses worker accommodation needs.These steps are expected to promote industrial growth and stability in labour-intensive sectors, while also creating new opportunities for real estate developers specialising in rental and affordable housing.The changes in long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax, however, have evoked a mixed reaction. The government lowered the long-term capital gains tax from 20% to 12.5%, which is a welcome step. However, this came with the removal of the indexation benefit.The changes could encourage more liquidity in property transactions and potentially increase the effective tax burden depending on the property’s acquisition date.The launch of Phase IV of the PM Gram Sadak Yojana in 25,000 rural habitations will improve connectivity in rural areas, promoting rural development and making these regions more accessible for investment. The primary objective of PMGSY is to build robust, all-weather roads in rural habitations. This initiative focuses on enhancing connectivity and supporting economic development in rural areas.In essence, the budget is geared towards stimulating growth and investment in the real estate sector , fostering a more transparent and investor-friendly environment, and contributing to overall development. It aims to create a balanced and inclusive growth environment by addressing the needs of various segments, including affordable housing, industrial workers and urban infrastructure.The effectiveness of the initiatives, however, hinges on their implementation and continued support of complementary reforms.","Budget 2024-25 is geared towards stimulating growth and investment in the real estate sector.

New Budget 2024 rule: Why Income Tax Department is likely to issue a huge number of tax notices this month,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-budget-2024-rule-why-income-tax-department-is-likely-to-issue-a-huge-number-of-tax-notices-this-month/articleshow/112186079.cms,"Taxing Times

Income Tax Notice on the way? The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month, as there are concerns that many taxpayers might escape the tax net due to the impending implementation of the new reassessment law on September 1, 2024.According to the amended regulation announced in Budget 2024 , the tax authorities can only go back a maximum of five years to reassess a taxpayer's records if the escaped income is at least Rs 50 lakh, and three years for an amount less than Rs 50 lakh.Previously, they could reassess cases up to 10 years old.According to an ET report, tax officials are now faced with the challenge of compiling and corroborating data on tax and income mismatches for the financial years 2013-14 to 2017-18 within the next few weeks, as these years will become time-barred for reassessment from September 1, 2024.The I-T department relies on information from various sources, such as banks, property registrars, and search findings from the investigation wing, to build reassessment cases.A tax officers' body has raised concerns about the feasibility of issuing notices under Section 148 (or 148A) in a large number of cases within a single month, given the overburdened nature of the jurisdictional assessing officers and the time-consuming process of obtaining sanction from the chief commissioner, who is the specified authority for such notices.Moreover, the law provides taxpayers with the right to explain their position before reassessment orders are finalized, a process that most believe cannot be completed by the end of August.Also Read | ITR refund status for FY 2023-24: How to check income tax refund status online - here’s a step-by-step guide for incometax.gov.in & NSDL websites The Central Board of Direct Taxes ( CBDT ) has been urged by its officers to postpone the effective date of the proposed amendment. However, this suggestion is unlikely to be well-received by corporations and high net worth individuals.""Capping the reassessment period at five years was a great decision as it would reduce hassles and litigation. But if the department fears there could be a genuine loss of revenue as it may not be possible to wrap up several matters by August 31, the government can think of strict parameters where time-bound cases can be selectively reopened - based on trails of steps taken in identifying escaped income,"" said Mitil Chokshi, partner at CA firm Chokshi & Chokshi.""Taxpayers may expect a rush of reassessment notices in August 2024. These notices are likely to be for the AYs 2018-19 and prior to that. It is pertinent to note that the Bombay High Court in a recent ruling in a case of Hexaware Technologies has taken a view on a proviso introduced in 2021, which can be interpreted to mean that AY 2017-18 (and prior years) got time barred on March 31, 2024. These reassessment notices (for AYs 2017-18 and prior) are likely to rake up new interpretation issues in the already muddled reassessment provisions,"" said Ashish Mehta, partner at law firm Khaitan & Co.The current situation is similar to the conflict between the Income Tax office and taxpayers in 2021. The reassessment law was amended in April 2021, allowing the tax office to reopen 10-year-old tax returns if the total undisclosed income exceeded Rs 50 lakh and reassess 4-year-old matters if the amount was less than Rs 50 lakh.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? However, this change led to over 10,000 writ petitions being filed by companies, arguing that they were not given sufficient time to explain and that the notices were issued without considering the carve-out that cases which couldn't be reopened earlier couldn't be reassessed under the new law.The Supreme Court invoked its extraordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution on May 4, 2022, to uphold all reassessment notices issued after March 31, 2021. However, the court left room for judicial proceedings based on the merits of each case, and several such matters are currently pending before the court.","The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month.

Are NPS Vatsalya & hiked NPS deduction limit for private sector employees good moves from Budget 2024?

NPS and EPF: Overlapping services

What is NPS Vatsalaya?

Latest NPS rules, news: In the Union Budget 2024 speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced two new initiatives with regard to National Pension Scheme (NPS) - extension of NPS 14% employer contribution benefits to private setcor and the intended launch of NPS Vatsalya.Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries, bringing it at par with the provisions available for government employees.Sriram Iyer, CEO, HDFC Pension Management told ET that with this move the “ground rules have been harmonised among government and non-government employees, which is a positive step.”Effectively, this means that now, private-sector employees can choose to reduce the taxable portion of employers’ contribution to their NPS corpus, thereby paying less tax and leaving greater funds in their pension deposits.“Employees will benefit from tax savings . More importantly, the 40% increase in contribution will have a significant impact on the terminal value of the retirement corpus,” remarked Iyer. The extended savings will “help in retirement planning, working as an option that is at par with the Provident Fund,” Dinesh Rohira, CEO & Founder, 5nance.com was quoted as saying.Moreover, the endeavour aims to increase NPS penetration by increasing tax incentives for the private sector, providing them a social security-cushion post-retirement.The scheme’s motive to widen the NPS subscriber base may not prove to be flawlessly effective, however. This is explained by Agrees Mrin Agarwal, Founder, Finsafe India: “While it’s good that the limit has been raised, it may not increase adoption as employees need to be educated in a big way. Also, the benefit is only for the salaried opting for the new tax regime,” she says.The mandatory contribution to the EPF, too, threatens to relegate the provisions of NPS under the umbrella of near-superfluity. This sentiment is echoed by Varun Sahay, a software engineer in a Delhi-based IT company: “When 12% of my salary is already deducted for the EPF, why should I put in more in the NPS and cut my take-home pay?”Rohira feels otherwise. “There’s no competition between the NPS and EPF as employees can contribute to both and build a 3-4 times bigger corpus while earning 3-4% higher returns via marketlinked options in the NPS,” he counters.Also Check | New Tax Regime 2023 vs 2024 After Budget: How Much Income Tax Will Salaried Taxpayers Save & How Do New Tax Slabs Compare To Old Regime? Top 10 Points You Must Know To jumpstart retirement savings for children, a new initiative called NPS Vatsalya has been unveiled in the Budget. This scheme allows parents and guardians to contribute to a minor's account, which can be converted into a regular NPS account once the child reaches adulthood.""It provides a very long duration for reaping the compounding benefits and accumulating a huge bounty at a later age. This can be a good way to plan a better future for kids who may not opt for a service segment in the future,"" says Rohira. Sriram Iyer agrees, stating, ""It’s a good move to help the child start his retirement journey. Even if a parent starts when the child is 10 years old, by the time he starts working, it can be a solid foundation for the compounding journey after that.""However, some experts question the utility of a product with such a long lock-in period, especially when parents cannot use the funds for essential goals like their child’s education amidst soaring education costs of 11-12%.""Parents are struggling to save for their own retirement, so it might be a bit of a stretch to expect them to save for their kids’ retirement. The need of the hour is a market-linked product that allows withdrawals only for the child’s education,"" says Mrin Agarwal, Founder of Finsafe India.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? Though the NPS permits partial withdrawals, it allows only 25% of the corpus after three years of joining, and this can be done only three times during the entire tenure. A premature exit before 60 years with 100% withdrawal is only possible if the corpus is less than Rs.2.5 lakh, an amount insufficient for most children's goals.""In its current form, there won’t be any uptake,"" asserts Agarwal. Rohira concurs, ""It’s a vanilla product with a lock-in, which does not make it very attractive and it may not take off. However, the government may optimise it and introduce new features later."" Iyer adds, ""This is just a start and there may be more subscriber-friendly features as we take it to the market. The regulator is proactive and open to feedback.""","Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries.

Gold import duty cut: Why Indians may not find buying gold from Dubai as attractive post Budget 2024,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-import-duty-cut-why-indians-may-not-find-buying-gold-from-dubai-as-attractive-post-budget-2024/articleshow/112097671.cms,"Gold import duty cut in Budget 2024: The recent reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai. Indian jewellers with stores in both India and the UAE believe that the narrowed duty differential will result in lower gold prices in India, making it less attractive for Indians to purchase gold in Dubai.The emirate had attracted gold-enthusiast Indians following a steep rise in customs duty in India in July 2022. In the fiscal 2024-25 budget, the duty on gold imports was more than halved.The duty cut is also expected to boost gold jewellery production in India, particularly the popular 'Kolkatti' jewellery from Kolkata, which is favored by Indian expats in Dubai and tourists from various countries. This move will encourage gold artisans to create new designs in both heavyweight and lightweight jewellery, attracting consumers to purchase gold from India.According to an ET report, Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group , estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India as Indian tourists who previously bought jewellery in Dubai will now prefer to shop in India. However, Indian expats living in Dubai and other customers may continue to buy from the UAE.Also Read | Gold losing sheen? Government cuts gold bond issuance target as investors look at better alternatives Rajiv Popley, director at Popley & Sons, believes that the perception of overseas gold being cheaper than in India is merely a mindset. He points out that the labour cost is significantly lower in India, and with the introduction of mandatory hallmarking and HUID numbers, the purity of gold in India is no longer a concern.Furthermore, NRIs in Dubai do not receive VAT refunds, and Indians travelling abroad only receive about 60% of the VAT back on their gold purchases. Gold trade analyst Bhargav Baidya suggests that the 1% duty differential between gold jewellery in India and Dubai will be offset by Indian jewellers offering discounts to retain and attract customers.Saurabh Gadgil, chairman of PNG Jewellers, notes that Indian import duty is now on par with the US, allowing Indian jewellers to offer competitive prices compared to other countries worldwide. The reduced customs duty is expected to make gold purchases in India more attractive and convenient for Indian consumers, potentially leading to a significant shift in their gold shopping preferences.",The reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai.

Gold losing sheen? The government has reduced its target for issuing gold bonds in the financial year 2024-25 by 38% compared to the previous interim budget goal, according to a senior official. The revised target stands at Rs 18,500 crore, down from Rs 29,638 crore estimated in the interim budget and Rs 26,852 crore (revised estimate) in 2023-24.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told ET ""The decision followed a reassessment of various factors, including investor demand, other investment products and uncertainties around the global economy, as the situation has changed since the interim budget in February.""After accounting for redemptions, the net issuances of sovereign gold bonds are now estimated at Rs 15,000 crore for this fiscal year, a significant decrease from the Rs 26,138 crore projected in the interim budget and Rs 25,352 crore in the revised estimate for 2023-24.Harish Galipelli, director at ILA Commodities India, attributed this shift to retail investors increasingly opting for equities in anticipation of better returns. He also noted that people are uncertain about the potential for further increases in gold prices in the short-to-medium term following a recent rally. Additionally, Galipelli pointed out that savings in rural areas have been impacted by retail inflation and other factors.The gold bond and gold monetisation schemes were introduced by the government in late 2015 to discourage the physical purchase of precious metals and reduce imports, thereby mitigating the negative impact on the current account deficit.The gross collection through these two schemes is now projected to be Rs 20,030 crore in 2024-25, compared to Rs 31,168 crore in the interim budget and Rs 28,240 crore (revised estimate) in the previous fiscal year. Similarly, the net collection is estimated at Rs 16,433 crore, down from Rs 27,571 crore in the interim budget and Rs 26,653 crore in the previous year.

Both schemes were designed to curb gold imports, which, along with crude oil, have been significant contributors to India's current account deficit.

Upon completion, SIA will hold a 25.1% stake in the enlarged Air India Group. SIA and Tata Sons are firmly committed to supporting the growth and success of the Air India Group, which post-merger will have a significant presence in all key Indian airline market segments (full service, low-cost, international, and domestic). This merger will reinforce SIA’s multi-hub strategy, and underscore its long-standing commitment to India through a direct stake in this large and rapidly growing aviation market,” the statement added.Only FDI approval was remaining for the merger as all other nods from agencies like the Competition Commission and DGCA are already in place. Tatas will have remaining 74.9% stake in AI.After Govt FDI nod, AI-Vistara will shortly communicate timelines of the merger to passengers. People who have booked tickets on Vistara flights post the date of merger will be informed that their flight will be on Air India along with the changed flight number of AI and its time.Sources say the date of merger is likely to be after Diwali (Nov 1) as the airline will avoid taking any chances during the peak festive travel season. “There will be a decent window between post Diwali and the onset of fog that usually happens after Dec 20 which leads to flight disruptions. Ideally the merger should happen in that space to sort out any merger teething issues like informing passengers booked on Vistara their changed AI flight details before fog adds further complexity to the equation,” said sources.Vistara has 70 aircraft which will continue to fly in the airline’s livery. The same will changed to AI’s new livery when the aircraft go in for heavy checks. “Taking out aircraft just for painting purpose and letting capacity take a hit makes no sense. Also Vistara aircraft have a better cabin product than that of AI’s old planes,” said sources.Vistara had earlier reached out to passengers informing them about the transfer of frequent flyer miles to AI’s loyalty programme. The movement of personnel has already started, with many Vistara employees now operating from AI’s new Gurgaon headquarters.Are there chances that passengers who have booked on a certain class of Vistara, say business or premium economy, on a flight that has to operate after the date of merger being shifted to economy on the AI flight they take as the latter’s business may be full or it may not have a premium economy? “There are little chances of such things happening,” said sources.AI management had last considered toyed with the idea of postponing Vistara’s merger. The reason: They wanted AI planes to be upgraded first and till then retain Vistara as the better product carrier. However given mounting concerns among Vistara employees about AI officials getting all key posts in the merged airline, that plan was shelved. So even as AI remains very much a work in slow progress, the merger is now going to happen before the end of this calendar year.","The Indian Govt has approved foreign direct investment ( FDI ) by Singapore Airlines into Air India.

""We are trying to make our SFMS (structured financial messaging system) global. The volume that SWIFT processes for cross-border transactions is much lower than that of SFMS. We are also considering making our INFINET (Indian Financial Network) available for others,"" said Vasudevan. ""So it will ultimately be a technology stack that we are trying to offer.

Puri Buch and Adani group have denied all allegations.The Sebi chief had also said that it had received over 6,000 comments on its consultation paper that proposed wide ranging changes to the rules for trading index-based derivative contracts. She said that the regulator was leveraging technology to scan through all the comments. And indicated that without the use of technology it would have been a massive task to scan through all the comments within a short time.Buch said that the small and medium REIT regulations were implemented after industry players, who, until recently were not regulated and thus faced trust-deficit from investors, approached the regulator. These norms are expected to allow greater participation of investors in the REIT segment of the market and give a boost to fractional ownership of real estate properties.In its report, Hindenburg had pointed out that Puri Buch's husband, Dhaval Buch had joined Blackstone, a major player in India's REITs space, when Buch was a whole time member at Sebi. Hindenburg had alleged that after Dhaval joined Blackstone, Puri Buch was instrumental in changing several of REIT regulations.

The ultimate list of altcoins set to explode,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/three-cryptos-to-buy-now-the-ultimate-list-of-altcoins-set-to-explode/articleshow/112894032.cms,"US Ready To Redefine Money As This Crypto Gem Set To Become A Top Meme Coin!

sThe crypto market is on the verge of another bull cycle. While top altcoins are preparing for positive price corrections, some are set to explode. These are the three cryptocurrencies ready for wild pumps this season.1. Crypto All Stars – Raining passive income in $STARSCrypto All-Stars ($STARS) is the latest meme coin to whip up a buying frenzy in the meme coin market.Interestingly, it is not a conventional meme coin. There is no pet breed mascot or quirky backstory that embellishes the project.Yet, meme coin investors are scrambling to secure $STARS tokens in the ongoing presale at low prices and high staking APYs. Why is $STARS topping the charts?Crypto All-Stars is a new crypto project that gives an investor deep exposure to the meme coin market. To make this possible, it launches a unified staking protocol that supports multi-token staking across different blockchains. The interoperable staking dashboard is called MemeVault .It brings top meme coins under one umbrella to not just simplify portfolio management, but also boost passive income from meme coins. In other words, the project rides the meme coin wave while nurturing a rapidly expanding community. It inspires the meme coin community to think beyond a pet-themed mascot and a catchy storyline.MemeVault makes it easier than ever for investors to reap rewards from their meme coin holdings. It saves the time and effort that go into juggling different staking platforms. Here, investors just need to deposit their meme coins into MemeVault and watch the rewards roll in.The returns are paid in $STARS tokens, the native crypto. $STARS holdings can potentially triple the returns from MemeVault. Clearly, the $STARS presale is attracting attention for valid reasons.A growing number of crypto influencers and analysts have been sharing bullish sentiments about $STARS, fuelling the surrounding hype. According to 99Bitcoins, $STARS is set to become a crypto gem.99Bitcoins is a top crypto educational YouTube channel with over 700K subscribers. The ongoing $STARS presale supports crypto and fiat purchases.2. Pepe Unchained – Top crypto with long-term and short-term price potentialPepe Unchained ($PEPU) is one of the most interesting new projects of 2024. On the outside, PEPU is another meme coin with a quirky account.“Pepe was trapped, confined to his clunky Layer 1 server room. But the story doesn't end there. With a stroke of Giga Brain genius, Pepe devised a plan to break free from his chains and embrace the future with PEPE Unchained,” reads the white paper.On a closer look, Pepe Unchained is a utility coin backed by a layer 2 solution. When platforms like Polygon and Optimism are already doing a good job at reducing network congestion, why do we need Pepe Unchained?The answer: Pepe Unchained is dedicated to meme coins. It narrows down its niche to the highly slippery crypto sector, which deserves its own specialised approach. In this volatile landscape, speed and efficiency can make or break a portfolio.Pepe Unchained comes with quicker transactions and lower fees. The layer-2 blockchain is suited for the chaotic meme coins.Pepe Unchained ($PEPU) hasn’t hit exchanges yet. However, the community has already grown to 11.2K followers on Twitter and nearly 6K on Telegram. The new meme coin is stirring up a crypto storm if the presale progress is any indication.With the presale passing the $11 million mark, investors are flocking to hoard $PEPU before it makes its exchange debut. The first series of exchange listings are expected to align with the next bull cycle, strengthening the initial momentum.The vibrant community could be the next big force in the new altcoin sector. Early $PEPU investors are also eligible for high staking rewards. At the time of writing, the staking APY (annual percentage yield) stood at 200%. 780 million $PEPU tokens have already been staked.As the presale enters the final stages, the staking APY will decline and the selling price will increase. In other words, early investors secure the best presale deals.3. Shiba Shootout – Top crypto to buy now in the play-to-earn sectorShiba Shootout ($SHIBASHOOT) is next on the list. The meme coin has embraced a thrilling play-to-earn utility to substantiate its long-term relevance. It is one of the few projects that cleverly combine the allure of meme coin excitement with practical utility.The $SHIBASHOOT presale is fast approaching the $1 million mark. As one of 2024's crypto offerings, the token launch is highly anticipated. Investors get attractive staking rewards starting from the presale stage.The project’s key strength is its play-to-earn gaming mechanics. Gunfights are regularly hosted in Shiba Gulch, allowing investors to earn $SHIBASHOOT tokens based on their gaming prowess. Marshal Shiba leads the fights in the Crypto Wild West.Due to its practical dimension and utility, the token has value beyond market speculation. In addition, the game's launch before its token release underscores Shiba Shootout's commitment to utility from the beginning. The $SHIBASHOOT craze is rapidly spreading across Telegram and Twitter.Meme coins are known for their dizzying rise and fall. With a unique ecosystem, Shiba Shootout brilliantly attempts to maximise the rise and minimise the fall.Shiba Inu (SHIB) has a gigantic market cap and historical appeal. When it comes to investment appeal, Shiba Inu lags. SHIB’s lacklustre performance over the last few years is an illustration of its saturation.SHIB doesn’t have a lot of steam left. Due to its much lower initial market cap and the heavily discounted presale prices, Shiba Shootout offers a more fertile investment opportunity.The allure of crypto Wild West adventures and sustainable tokenomics makes it one of the top new altcoins to watch now.",Crypto All-Stars ($STARS) is the latest meme coin to whip up a buying frenzy in the meme coin market. Pepe Unchained ($PEPU) is one of the most interesting new projects of 2024. Shiba Shootout ($SHIBASH) is set to be the next big force in the new altcoin sector.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112894458,imgsize-777802,width-838,resizemode-4/112894458.jpg"

Air travelers in Malaysia to get full refund for delayed flights,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/air-travelers-in-malaysia-to-get-full-refund-for-delayed-flights/articleshow/112883937.cms,"Airlines in Malaysia will have to give passengers the option of a refund if their flight is delayed for five hours or more, as the Southeast Asian nation joins countries beefing up consumer air-travel rights.Transport regulators around the world are pressuring carriers to improve standards after a series of flight schedule meltdowns and questionable business practices sparked calls for reform.In Australia, Qantas Airways Ltd. was sued for allegedly selling seats on thousands of canceled flights.Malaysia’s new rules, which take effect from Monday, will also apply to passengers who chose not to proceed with the delayed flight and opt to purchase a different flight altogether.The country’s flagship carrier has been suffering a series of disruptions due to ongoing engine-related problems on its Airbus SE A330 aircraft. Malaysia Airlines said earlier this month that it needs to reduce its flight network between now and December.Refunds will need to be offered via the original means of payment, Malaysia’s transport ministry said.Earlier this year, the US Department of Transportation ordered airlines to provide automatic refunds for flights that are axed or significantly delayed. Protections for travelers in the US were strengthened after spiraling complaints about airlines refusing or delaying refunds.Australia meanwhile has started consulting on wholesale reforms to boost competition and consumer rights in aviation, including making it easier for passengers to be refunded.Qantas Chief Executive Officer Vanessa Hudson, talking to investors after the release of the carrier’s full-year financial results on Thursday, said that forcing airlines to refund fares for cancellations and delays just adds to ticket costs, because airlines will look to recoup the added expenses elsewhere.Malaysia said airlines found to be contravening the new regulations may be fined a maximum of 200,000 ringgit ($46,000) and the amount could be more for subsequent breaches.",Malaysia will require airlines to give passengers the option of a refund if their flight is delayed for five hours or more.

Nvidia tumbles after disappointing forecast,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/nvidia-tumbles-after-disappointing-forecast/articleshow/112881809.cms,"Nvidia Corp failed to live up to investor hopes with its latest results on Wednesday, delivering an underwhelming forecast and news of production snags with its much-awaited Blackwell chips.The company’s quarterly report — the most anticipated part of the tech industry’s earnings season — met or beat analysts’ estimates on nearly every measure. But Nvidia investors have grown accustomed to blowout quarters, and the latest numbers didn’t qualify.Moreover, Nvidia’s next big cash cow — the new Blackwell processor lineup — has proven more challenging to manufacture than anticipated. The product is the next generation of the company’s dominant artificial intelligence processor, and fears of delays contributed to a stock decline of as much as 8.4% in late trading. The shares had more than doubled this year through Wednesday’s close, following a gain of 239% in 2023.“It was up against lofty and unsustainable expectations,” Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Kunjan Sobhani and Oscar Hernandez Tejada said in a note.Third-quarter revenue will be about $32.5 billion, the company said. Though analysts had predicted $31.9 billion on average, estimates ranged as high as $37.9 billion.The disappointing outlook threatens to tamp down an AI frenzy that has transformed Nvidia into the world’s second-most-valuable company. The chipmaker is the key beneficiary of a race to upgrade data centers to handle AI software, and its sales forecasts have become a barometer for that spending boom.Heading into the announcement, there was concern that Nvidia was having problems with its new Blackwell design. The company acknowledged that there were issues with production, saying that it was making changes to improve its manufacturing yield — the number of functioning chips that come out of factories. At the same time, the company said it expects to bring in “several billion dollars” of revenue in the fourth quarter from the product.Supplies will be plentiful after manufacturing gains momentum, Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang said later during a Bloomberg Television interview. “We’re going to have lots and lots of supply, and we will be able to ramp,” he said. Nvidia is coming off a string of quarters that shattered Wall Street expectations — even as analysts continued to raise estimates. But the amount of upside has been trending down.Most of Nvidia’s growth also has come from a small group of customers. About 40% of Nvidia’s revenue stems from large data-center operators — companies like Alphabet Inc’s Google and Meta Platforms Inc — which are pouring tens of billions of dollars into AI infrastructure.Though Meta and others have increased their capital expenditure budgets this earnings season, there’s been concern that the amount of infrastructure being put in place exceeds current requirements. That could lead to a bubble. But Nvidia’s Huang has maintained that this is only the beginning of a new era for technology and the economy.Expectations were lofty. Nvidia has been the best performing stock in the S&P 500 Index this year, eclipsing gains by all other semiconductor companies. At a market value of more than $3 trillion, Nvidia is worth roughly the same amount as the next 10 largest chip firms combined.Nvidia made its name by selling video-game cards, but is now best known for so-called AI accelerators. These chips, derived from its graphics processors, are used to develop artificial intelligence software by bombarding it with information.The process, known as training, makes AI models better at recognizing and responding to real-world inputs. Nvidia’s components are also used in systems that then run the software, a stage known as inference, and help power services such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT .Last quarter’s results topped Wall Street projections, and the Santa Clara, California-based company’s board approved an additional $50 billion in stock buybacks.Nvidia’s revenue more than doubled to $30 billion in the fiscal second quarter, which ended July 28. Excluding certain items, profit was 68 cents a share. Analysts had predicted sales of about $28.9 billion and earnings of 64 cents a share.Nvidia got a jump on other chipmakers because its technology was well-suited to the needs of AI. But rivals are trying to catch up. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. is now its closest competitor, with Intel Corp. — once the world’s biggest chipmaker — trailing further behind. Their combined revenue from the market is only about 5% of Nvidia’s total.Nvidia’s data-center division — now by far its largest source of sales — generated $26.3 billion of revenue last quarter. Gaming chips provided $2.9 billion. Analysts had given targets of $25.1 billion for the data-center unit and $2.79 billion for gaming.Blackwell is expected to generate a fresh wave of growth when it rolls out in the coming months. Analysts have downplayed concerns about delays, noting that the company still enjoys huge demand for its current generation of products. That could help Nvidia cope with any delays without a big financial hit.In describing its challenges with Blackwell, Nvidia said it had to change a mask production step to improve its yield. A mask is the template used to burn the circuit pattern into materials deposited on a disk of silicon.Production of Blackwell is set to ramp up in the fourth quarter and continue into the next fiscal year, Nvidia said.During a post-results conference call, analysts sought more details on the amount of revenue that the new Blackwell chips would deliver and when. Huang and Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress stuck to their promise of billions of dollars in the fourth quarter, refusing to elaborate further.The stock extended its declines as the call went on and answers weren’t provided.In his typical fashion, Huang made high-level predictions on the future of the computing industry, arguing that a trillion dollars of equipment will be needed to replace outmoded gear in the world’s data centers. That replacement process is just beginning, he said.AI is taking over computer search, helping companies speed up their business processes, and needed by countries to secure data, he said.“It’s affecting how every layer of computing is done,” Huang said.",N Nvidia Corp delivered an underwhelming forecast and news of production snags with its much-awaited Blackwell chips.

Unless new solutions are found, interlinking fast payment systems might increase the risk-management burden for banks that participate in them.

He was speaking at the Global Fintech Fest here on Wednesday.The Fed has launched its own fast payment network FedNow Service. ""We are still at the beginning of a multiyear journey of establishing a ubiquitous network covering the majority of institutions in our country. Variation around the world in domestic fast payment network adoption means that the value of globally interlinked systems is not yet clear,"" said Waller.The governor said technical feasibility and legal issues can be managed as some bilateral arrangements have shows, but each link needs complex negotiations and bilateral links are impractical for global scale. While multilateral setups offer efficiencies, they are still resource-intensive. However, RBI executive director P Vasudevan was still hopeful of linking India-US fast payments. ""You have given a positive hope that we will see the linkage happen between FedNow and UPI even if it may take a little while,"" Vasudevan said, adding that it will make remittances cheaper and faster.","The US has expressed reservations about the international linking of domestic fast payments like the UPI.

US bond yields to rise above 4 per cent despite Fed rate cuts: Deutsche Bank,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-bond-yields-to-rise-above-4-per-cent-despite-fed-rate-cuts-deutsche-bank/articleshow/112871947.cms,"Deutsche bank has said that the 10-year US Treasury yield is likely to hike by 4 per cent in the coming weeks, with markets currently over-hyped about the amount of reduction in rate, the Federal Reserve may deliver.As inflation slows down and the labor market weakens, investors price in around 100 basis points of interest rate reduction from the Fed this year.The 10-year Treasury yield, which affects the borrowing costs around the world, has fallen almost 40 basis points over the last month to 3.8 per cent.The bank stated that a move to around 4.1 per cent in the coming weeks was likely.Francis Yared, Deutsche bank's global head of rates research recommends shorting 10-year US Treasuries, which necessarily implies that the bond price is expected to fall and yields rise.Yared told Reuters on Wednesday that investors were too optimistic in pricing 100 bps of rate cuts , which implies a 50 bps cut at one meeting.He reflected the metrics to show that the US economy has remained relatively sturdy, including a stabilization in commercial and industrial loans in the second quarter.He said that it's no longer consistent with below potential growth, further adding,""And...you're not seeing an acceleration of the weakness in jobless claims.""The head also said that longer-dated yields are expected to rise to compensate investors for a greater uncertain inflation outlook and for higher levels of supply hitting the market as US deficits balloon.He said, ""Inflation risks, even though inflation is coming down now, they're quite different from what they were pre-COVID... and supply and demand is also in a materially different place.""Yared said that a weak August US jobs report at the start of September could scupper the short 10-year US Treasury trade, by justifying steep Fed rate cuts over the rest of the year.",The 10-year US Treasury yield has fallen almost 40 basis points over the last month to 3.8 per cent.

Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway tops $1 trillion in market value,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/warren-buffetts-berkshire-hathaway-tops-1-trillion-in-market-value/articleshow/112871640.cms,"Berkshire Hathaway Inc became the first US company outside of the tech sector to surpass $1 trillion in market value.Shares of Warren Buffett ’s conglomerate rose as much as 0.8% on Wednesday to push its market capitalization above the trillion-dollar mark for the first time. The stock has rallied this year on strong insurance results and economic optimism.The Omaha, Nebraska-based company joins the ranks of a small group to crack the milestone, dominated by technology giants like Alphabet Inc, Meta Platforms Inc and Nvidia Corp .“Berkshire has done it the slower, but more sure, way,” said Steve Check, the founder and chief investment officer of Check Capital Management. His firm has about $2 billion in assets under management, with Berkshire as their largest holding. “It’s harder to make money the old-fashioned way.”Berkshire’s rally this year has outpaced the S&P 500’s gains, with the company off to one of its best annual starts in a decade. It’s gained 30% in 2024, while the market benchmark is up 18%. The company isn’t that far behind the so-called Magnificent Seven: a gauge of the biggest tech stocks is up 35% this year.Buffett has spent the bulk of his life turning Berkshire Hathaway from a struggling textile maker into a sprawling business empire. He shaped the company alongside longtime business partner Charlie Munger, who died in November at age 99.Berkshire’s market value climbed by roughly 20% a year from 1965 through last year — nearly double the S&P 500’s annual return in that time. That’s turned Buffett into one of the richest people in the world, and perhaps the most prolific investor ever.The conglomerate’s strength comes as optimism for the economy builds, with the Federal Reserve expected to cut interest rates at its September meeting. Consumer confidence rose to a six-month high in August. Berkshire’s businesses span from truck stop operator Pilot Travel Centers LLC to ice cream chain Dairy Queen and battery brand Duracell.The stock has added more than $200 billion in market capitalization this year alone — a record for the firm, but a sharp contrast to Nvidia’s nearly $2 trillion increase. Berkshire’s rally has pushed it into overbought territory, based on the relative strength index, and prompted a bit of reticence from analysts.The fundamental outlook for Berkshire’s core businesses isn’t necessarily that much brighter ahead, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Matthew Palazola, but the firm boasts an “all-weather” portfolio.Meanwhile, lower interest rates could impact returns on the record cash pile Berkshire amassed while slashing its Apple Inc. stake and paring its Bank of America Corp holdings. Buffett’s cash heap stood at about $276.9 billion in second-quarter results reported in early August. The sheer size of the Apple stake had become a worry, Check said, and the move to reduce that exposure was prudent. “It’s taken a lot of that risk off the table,” Check said.","Berkshire Hathaway Inc became the first US company outside of the tech sector to surpass $1 trillion in market value.

PetroSaudi executives get Swiss jail terms over USD 1.8 billion 1MDB fraud,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/petrosaudi-execs-get-swiss-jail-terms-over-1-8-bn-1mdb-fraud/articleshow/112871220.cms,"- 'Lavish lifestyle' -

BELLINZONA: A top Swiss court sentenced two PetroSaudi executives to jail terms on Wednesday after finding them guilty over the embezzlement of USD 1.8 billion from the Malaysian sovereign wealth fund 1MDB .Tarek Obaid, the Swiss-Saudi chief executive of the oil exploration and production company, was sentenced to seven years in prison by the Federal Criminal Court, Switzerland's Keystone-ATS news agency reported.Patrick Mahony, a Swiss-British director at PetroSaudi, was given a six-year sentence, the agency said.Prosecutor Alice de Chambrier had sought a 10-year sentence for Obaid and a nine-year term for his right-hand man.Obaid, 48, and Mahony, 47, were seen arriving separately at the court in the southern city of Bellinzona ahead of the verdict hearing.The trial was heard by three judges at the court in April.Obaid and Mahony were accused of involvement in a vast embezzlement orchestrated by Jho Low, an advisor to former Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak.Noting the sums involved compared to Malaysia's GDP, Chambrier called it the ""scam of the century"" and branded the defendants as ""calculative, manipulative and obscenely greedy"", Keystone-ATS reported during the trial.The defence pleaded for acquittal, arguing that no fraud had taken place.According to the original indictment, ""the two accused are alleged, with the aim of enriching themselves and others, to have misappropriated at least USD 1.8 billion"", transferred by 1MDB in connection with a joint venture with PetroSaudi, ""and then to have laundered the amounts involved"".""The allegations cover a period at least from 2009 to 2015 and constitute the offences of fraud on a commercial basis, aggravated criminal mismanagement, and aggravated money laundering.""The indictment said the defendants ""used money misappropriated from 1MDB"" to acquire real estate in Switzerland and in London, jewellery and private equity.They were also accused of using the money ""to develop PetroSaudi activities from which they received substantial income, and to maintain a lavish lifestyle"".The multi-billion-dollar 1MDB financial scandal has led to criminal investigations around the world, including in the United States, Switzerland and Singapore.It is alleged that billions of dollars were pilfered from the 1Malaysia Development Berhad fund by a number of people and used to buy items ranging from artwork to a superyacht.The 1MDB scandal led to the fall of Najib's government in 2018.In 2022, the former prime minister was sentenced to 12 years in jail in Malaysia for offences linked to the misuse of public money. In February, his sentence was halved to six years.During the Swiss trial , Chambrier said Obaid and Mahony squandered their loot on precious stones, private jets, rented yachts and property in London and Geneva.She accused them of ""extraordinary criminal activity and tenacity"" over 10 years between 2009 and 2019, if alleged acts of concealment are included, Keystone-ATS reported.The defence lawyers tried to set out the context of relations between PetroSaudi and 1MDB.Nicolas Rouiller said the Swiss attorney-general's office had ""adopted a radically wrong approach"", ignoring the nature of Saudi Arabia's absolute monarchy.He said individuals, especially those belonging to very high-ranking families like Obaid, were not free in their actions.As for the use of an Islamic loan, Rouiller said it was a common practice in Muslim countries and could not therefore be seen as a dishonest manoeuvre aimed at cheating 1MDB.""There is no injury in this operation. This is exactly what is wanted"" by the partners, he said.Lawyer Daniel Zappelli said several allegations had been dropped by the prosecution, highlighted the absence of Najib and Low and said there were variations in the amounts that the defendants allegedly laundered, Keystone-ATS reported.The defence also said Riyadh and Kuala Lumpur wanted to strengthen relations following Najib's election in 2009 and claimed the Malaysians wanted a joint venture between 1MDB and PetroSaudi wrapped up quickly.","Tarek Obaid, the Swiss-Saudi chief executive of the oil exploration and production company, was sentenced to seven years in prison.
